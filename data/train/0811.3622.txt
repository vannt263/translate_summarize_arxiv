    "the blackbody components of each model , @xmath18b@xmath17(@xmath9,t@xmath15 ) and @xmath19b@xmath17(@xmath9,t@xmath14 ) , represent optically thick continuum emission , unsubtracted stellar photosphere emission ( f@xmath17 proportional to 1/@xmath31 , and it should be small for spectra for which we have not already subtracted a planck function at the stellar effective temperature to represent it ) , and emission from grains in the optically thin disk regions whose opacities are featureless continua , like amorphous carbon and very large silicate grains .",
    "the model components proportional to opacity multiplied by a planck function represent emission from submicron- to few - micron - sized dust grains , located in the optically thin disk regions , with strong resonances giving rise to detectable features in their opacities",
    ".    we will assume in the following that all grain species in the same location in the disk have the same temperature , the thermal coupling provided by gas .",
    "@xcite find that the layer with a@xmath4 @xmath32 0.1 ( where a@xmath4 is the visual extinction of star into the disk ) , the layer above the layer where dust emission features arise ( what they call the `` superheated surface layer '' ) , has gas and dust temperatures within 10% of each other , suggesting the gas would bring dust grains of differing optical properties to roughly the same temperature . in general , settling of dust towards the disk midplane @xcite should enhance the gas particle density for the optically thin regions in the disk atmosphere that gives rise to the 10 @xmath0 silicate feature because the gas density is higher towards the disk midplane ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so dust and gas temperatures should be better coupled in more settled disks .",
    "however , @xcite found that , for a fiducial disk at 1 au , the dust grains should remain at their radiative equilibrium temperatures , undisturbed by gas - grain collisions , for the vast majority of plausible gas particle densities , 10@xmath33 to 3@xmath34 @xmath35 , at this distance from the star .",
    "they found that only between about 10@xmath36 and 3@xmath34 @xmath35 would the dust grain temperatures be affected by collisions with gas molecules . at 8 au ,",
    "@xcite find that gas and dust temperatures are only equal for a@xmath4 slightly greater than 1 , suggesting greater difference between dust and gas temperature in the `` superheated surface layer '' than @xcite predict .",
    "for the purposes of dust modeling of t tauri stars , planck functions and opacity - weighted planck functions at two temperatures ( at most ) will be used , while keeping in mind the results of these sophisticated studies of dust and gas coupling .",
    "we allow for the two temperatures in order to study compositional differences of disks between inner disk regions and outer disk regions . if , however , there is not sufficient coupling of dust and gas heating in the optically thin surface layers giving rise to emission features in our tts spectra , this means dust that absorbs starlight poorly at optical and near - infrared wavelengths with respect to mid - infrared wavelengths , like enstatite and forsterite , will be located closer to the star than dust like iron - rich amorphous pyroxene and olivine at the same temperature .",
    "such iron - rich amorphous silicates absorb starlight more efficiently at visible and near - infrared wavelengths with respect to mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .    to determine the best fit of a model to a spectrum , we minimize @xmath37 between the model and the 7.7 - 37 @xmath0 region of the spectrum , with respect to the two temperatures , the solid angles , and the mass weights .",
    "we choose ranges of t@xmath15 and t@xmath14 to explore , and , picking a single pair of [ t@xmath15,t@xmath14 ] , we minimize @xmath37 ,    @xmath39^{2 } ~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with respect to all solid angles and all mass weights .",
    "when this results in mass weights or solid angles that are negative , we eliminate from the model the component whose flux integrated from 7.7 - 37 @xmath0 is most negative , and minimize @xmath37 of the model without this component .",
    "this is repeated at a given temperature pair [ t@xmath15,t@xmath14 ] until there are no negative mass weights .",
    "this entire process is carried out for each temperature pair . the temperature pair for which @xmath37 per degree of freedom ( where the number of degrees of freedom is the number of data points ( @xmath11200 ) minus the number of temperatures used , 2 , minus the number of nonzero solid angles minus the number of nonzero mass weights ) is lowest is the best - fit model for a spectrum .",
    "we also determine uncertainties for our model parameters .",
    "we define the uncertainty in a parameter to be the increment of the parameter from its best - fit model value that changes by 1.0 the value of @xmath37 per degree of freedom , or @xmath40 , of the model with the incremented value of the parameter .",
    "we use a taylor series expansion to approximate this .",
    "we note that our definition of uncertainty in a parameter is similar to what @xcite call `` independent point uncertainty '' in that all model parameters are kept at their best - fit values except for the one whose uncertainty is being determined .",
    "however , our uncertainties are determined differently from how others have been determined in the literature .",
    "@xcite suggest taking the uncertainty to be that increment of the parameter that increases @xmath37 by a number computed from the incomplete gamma function for a given level of significance .",
    "@xcite found that uncertainties computed using the increment in @xmath41 determined in this manner are quite consistent with uncertainties computed from monte carlo analysis .",
    "in such an analysis , the standard deviation in the set of parameter values obtained by fitting multiple versions of the same spectrum , each manipulated by adding noise according to poisson statistics , is taken to be the uncertainty in that parameter .",
    "for example , the model for dg tau has only eight constraints .",
    "the incomplete gamma function implies that an increment of @xmath41 of 9.31 would determine the 68.3% ( one sigma ) uncertainty level on parameters .",
    "this would result in a one sigma uncertainty on the mass weight of cool small amorphous pyroxene of @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "this is nearly identical to the uncertainty on this component obtained _ via _ the monte carlo analysis described previously of @xmath44 @xmath43 . using the method adopted in this study , an uncertainty of @xmath45 @xmath43 is obtained , which is almost 5 times higher than the one sigma uncertainties obtained using the incomplete gamma function to determine the increment of @xmath41 or the monte carlo approach .",
    "we note that , since the number of data points ( about 200 ) in one of our spectra is much greater than the number of model constraints ( by a factor of @xmath520 ) , our uncertainty level involves increasing @xmath37 by much more than suggested by @xcite . by so doing , we conservatively bias the uncertainties in our parameter values to many times one sigma .",
    "our models include the opacity of annealed silica from @xcite .",
    "this was shown to provide the best fit to emission features at 9 , 12 , 16 , and 20 @xmath0 in astronomical spectra of tts by @xcite .",
    "we now justify our choice of opacities for submicron amorphous and crystalline silicates and large ( few - micron - sized ) silicate dust grains . in order to choose the best opacity curves to use to model emission from tts",
    ", we assume that all disks in our sample have the same major kinds of dust , but in different relative abundances . assuming all disks have basically the same major kinds of dust - amorphous silicates of olivine and pyroxene composition , crystalline olivines , crystalline pyroxenes , and crystalline silica - our goal is to find the best realistic opacities to represent these major kinds of dust , not necessarily to constrain the specific properties of the grains themselves ( e.g. , sizes , porosities , composition ) .",
    "the first opacity for our models with which we concern ourselves is that of forsterite .",
    "olivines have been used before in modeling dust emission to fit emission ( and sometimes absorption ) complexes at 10.0 , 11.2 , 16 , 19 , 23 , 28 , and 33 @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one spectrum for which these features appear at very high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is that of hbc 656 , which we include as our first and most important forsterite exemplar .",
    "others with these features in their spectra at fairly high s / n ratios that we include as forsterite exemplars are dk tau , gn tau , is tau , roxs 42c ( which has already been identified as a silica exemplar ; see * ? ? ?",

    "we include opacities from transmission measurements of the following olivine powders pressed into potassium bromide ( kbr ) pellets : forsterite ( mg@xmath2sio@xmath3 ) , magnesium - rich olivine ( mg@xmath46fe@xmath47sio@xmath3 ) , hortonolite ( mgfesio@xmath3 ) , and fayalite ( fe@xmath2sio@xmath3 ) .",
    "to explore further the effects on opacity of the full range of iron content in the olivine solid series ( olivines of all mg / fe ratios ) , we include 8 opacities measured by @xcite for the range of 0.77@xmath13x@xmath131.0 for olivines of composition mg@xmath48fe@xmath49sio@xmath3 , and also x=0.218 .",
    "in addition , we created a hybrid forsterite opacity using the x=1 ( `` fo100 '' ) opacity from @xcite for @xmath9 @xmath13 15 @xmath0 and room - temperature forsterite opacity measured by @xcite for @xmath9 @xmath5 15 @xmath0 .",

    "frequently associated with this is also the cde opacity for forsterite from the same optical constants .",
    "the best fits seem to come from a combination of cde2 and cde shape distributions of forsterite using optical constants from @xcite , suggesting that a shape distribution intermediate in weighting between cde2 and cde is indicated .",
    "further , we note that the cde shape distribution is somewhat unphysical , requiring ellipsoids either infinitely long or infinitesimally thin .",
    "we therefore computed an opacity curve for a custom - designed shape distribution of ellipsoids intermediate in weighting between that of cde2 and of cde .",
    "we note that a similar attempt was made by @xcite resulting in what those authors called `` modified continuous distribution of ellipsoids '' . as the features for forsterite grains in the cde shape distribution peak at wavelengths slightly longward of the peaks in the data and those of the cde2 shape distribution of forsterite grains peak at wavelengths shortward of the peaks in the data , we expect the intermediate shape distribution to give opacity peaks at more optimal wavelengths than do the cde or cde2 shape distributions .",

    "very similar conclusions were also reached by @xcite , finding that the typical grain size of crystalline silicate grains used in their models of seven spectra were submicron , but typical amorphous silicate grain sizes were up to 6 @xmath0 radius ( solid grains ) .    because the grains in protoplanetary disks grow primarily by sticking together , it is likely large grains will be heterogeneous , composed of various sub - micron components , similar to the idps .",
    "the small amorphous components are believed to come directly from the ism , with sizes @xmath13 0.25 @xmath0 in radius .",

    "dd tau , de tau , and v710 tau all share this problem , as is seen in figure 6 , with the model of fx tau broken into its components .",

    "grain shape distributions more heavily weighted toward extreme shapes ( extremely flat , extremely elongated ) , larger grains ( or large aggregates of small grains , with a large fraction of these small grains being forsterite ) , olivine grains with nonzero fe / mg ratios , and forsterite grains with greater porosity would all result in forsterite emission features at longer wavelengths than resulted from the forsterite tcde curve ( solid spheres of forsterite give rise to opacity features at shorter wavelengths than those of forsterite in the cde shape distribution , and the opacity curve of 60% porous spheres of forsterite is almost identical to that of forsterite in the cde shape distribution * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also ,",
    "both coku tau/3 and fx tau ( fig .",
    "4 ) have 23 and 33 @xmath0 emission complexes with emission that extends to longer wavelengths than provided by the submicron forsterite grains in the tcde shape distribution in our models .",
    "that both spectra lack significant 28 @xmath0 complexes indicates the dominant form of crystals giving rise to 20 - 37 @xmath0 emission for these two systems is forsterite and not enstatite .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the 10 @xmath0 complexes in the spectra of both coku tau/3 and fx tau are fit fairly well .",
    "we therefore conclude there is variation in the exact details of the olivine grain populations in the protoplanetary disks in our sample , in terms of average grain shape , grain size , grain composition , and grain porosity . for dd tau , de tau , and v710 tau",
    ", this variation occurs for the warmer forsterite grains , while for coku tau/3 and fx tau , this variation occurs for the cooler forsterite grains .",
    "we note that most of these five also seem to have emission features at 14 @xmath0 wavelength ( see below , section 4.8 ) . whatever gives rise to these 14 @xmath0 features",
    "is not necessarily related to the poor fits to the forsterite features because the poor fitting happens over very limited wavelength ranges of 11 - 11.5 @xmath0 and 23 - 25 @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the olivine component of our models , the silica component may also vary in details of grain properties among all disks in our sample .",
    "while the silica features at 9 , 12.6 , and 20 @xmath0 in the spectrum of zz tau ( and the other silica exemplars ) are fairly fit well with the annealed silica opacity used , others like the 12.6 @xmath0 features in the spectra of dn tau and fz tau are not quite so well fit ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "fz tau has a single - peaked feature in this wavelength range , but it peaks at 12.45 @xmath0 , shortward of the wavelength at which annealed silica peaks .",
    "this could suggest the polymorph of silica giving rise to this feature is @xmath6-quartz at somewhat elevated temperatures of 500 - 625k ( see discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "dn tau appears to have a double - peaked feature , which would suggest @xmath6-quartz at @xmath11 300k @xcite , but the s / n at these wavelengths is low for this spectrum so its reality is more doubtful ( note the discussion on the effect of unresolved emission lines in this section ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the presence of silica argues for high - temperature processing , as it is not present in the interstellar medium and therefore should not be present as the starting dust mixture as the protoplanetary disk formed from its protostellar envelope .",
    "if @xmath6-quartz can be confirmed , the silica , once formed , must cool slowly enough to allow phase transition from a higher - temperature polymorph , like tridymite or cristobalite , to @xmath71-quartz , then @xmath6-quartz .",
    "we show the model fits to our enstatite exemplars in figure 8 , with the model of fn tau broken into components .",
    "other than a mismatch between model and spectrum for fn tau at 11.6 @xmath0 , the fits to the 10 @xmath0 complexes are generally good .",
    "however , we note the poorness of fit of our models to the longest wavelength complexes ( 28 and 33 @xmath0 ) of the spectra of fn tau and dh tau , our two best enstatite exemplars . the height - to - continuum ratios in our models of these two exemplars for the 28 and 33 @xmath0 complexes are unacceptably low compared to those in the spectra .",
    "we note the progressively increasing height - to - continuum ratio of the 19 , 23 , 28 , and 33 @xmath0 complexes in the spectra of both dh tau and fn tau .",
    "the rest of our sample are sufficiently fit using crystalline dust at two temperatures .",
    "this suggests that a population of submicron enstatite or forsterite dust at a third ( very low ) temperature would be required to give acceptable fits to these spectra .",
    "we note this lack of a third model temperature is not a problem for spectra requiring abundant forsterite ( figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "note in figure 6 the problem is not insufficient peak - to - continuum ratio for the model forsterite features ; rather , the problem is insufficient width of the features , which is a problem with the forsterite opacity .    the lh part of the spectrum of haro 6 - 37 ( 19.3 - 37 @xmath0 wavelength ) suffers from an artifact , in which each of the 10 spectral orders are tilted such that the flux density of their short - wavelength end is higher than it should be and the flux density of their long - wavelength end is lower than it should be . these tilted spectral orders , which could be interpreted to resemble narrow crystalline silicate features longward of 19.3 @xmath0 wavelength , result from an artifact of the reduction of the lh spectrum of this object .",
    "this artifact could be due either to unsubtracted sky emission or to mispointing of the telescope with respect to haro 6 - 37 along or perpendicular to the length of the lh slit .",
    "spectra requiring abundant submicron amorphous silicate grains and model fits to these spectra are shown in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "figure 9 shows the spectra and corresponding models of five of our amorphous silicate exemplars ( see section 3.4 ) and the model breakdown into components for fm tau . in general , from 7.7",
    "to slightly longward of 30 @xmath0 wavelength , the fits of the models to the data are excellent . for gm aur and",
    "especially lkca 15 , the each model fits the continuum at wavelengths greater than 30 @xmath0 with emission from a weak 33 @xmath0 complex of forsterite .",
    "this is an artifact , as these two spectra require a third model temperature to fit the data using emission from a blackbody or amorphous silicates at a very low temperature .",
    "figure 10 shows spectra whose models also require relatively high abundances of submicron amorphous silicates , though they require more crystalline silicates and large grains than those shown in figure 9 ; the model of hq tau is broken into its components as an example .",
    "again , the model fits to the data are very good , with the exception of a slight insufficiency in the peak - to - continuum ratio of the forsterite 33 @xmath0 complex in the model of dp tau .",
    "the spectra of cy tau , df tau , dg tau , dl tau , dq tau , it tau , and v807 tau show 10 @xmath0 complexes of small equivalent width ( see figure 11 ; the model of df tau is broken into components ) .",
    "cy tau , df tau , dl tau , and it tau also have essentially flat spectra over all irs wavelengths , being consistent with the models presented by @xcite and their interpretation of settling of dust grains . settling of dust in a disk results in the disk being flatter and less flared , which gives rise to a bluer spectral continuum color in the mid - infrared and also less equivalent width in the distinctive silicate features .",
    "@xcite noted cy tau for its flat spectral colors over infrared wavelengths .",
    "these spectra are well fit mostly by emission from submicron dust grains and the two blackbody components in the models .",
    "cy tau requires a small amount of silica to fit in the 10 @xmath0 complex and a moderate amount of cool forsterite to fit longer wavelength complexes , especially the 33 @xmath0 feature .",
    "the emission required by large grains in the model for df tau to fit the longer wavelengths of its spectrum is the largest of the five low 10 @xmath0 equivalent width spectra , in addition to small amounts of emission from submicron dust grains .",
    "little emission from forsterite is required to give rise to the 10 @xmath0 feature of dg tau , while a fair amount of submicron amorphous pyroxene is required to fit its mild 20 @xmath0 feature .",
    "the 10 @xmath0 feature of dl tau requires modest amounts of emission from forsterite and silica and lesser amounts from other kinds of dust .",
    "the lh spectrum ( 19.3 - 37 @xmath0 ) of dl tau suffers from an order - tilt artifact as does haro 6 - 37 ( see above ) , limiting the precision with which we can determine the crystallinity and large grain content of the cooler outer disk , but it appears to be optimally fit using a mixture of both amorphous and crystalline grains .",
    "dq tau has subtle features at 9.3 , 9.8 , 10.6 , 11.1 , and 11.6 @xmath0 that require a moderate amount of enstatite .",
    "it tau requires small amounts of many of the submicron amorphous and crystalline grains to fit its miniscule 10 @xmath0 complex , but its broad 20 @xmath0 feature is fit well by submicron amorphous pyroxene .",
    "the same applies to the fit of the 20 @xmath0 feature of v807 tau , though it requires a modest amount of large amorphous pyroxene to fit its 10 @xmath0 feature .",
    "the abundance of crystalline grains with respect to amorphous grains in the models of these five spectra is consistent with the finding by @xcite using all ( and more ) of the spectra analyzed in this study that increased crystallinity accompanies more advanced settling of dust in disks as measured by continuum indices n@xmath72 and n@xmath73 .",
    "it is also noted that these seven spectra with small equivalent width 10 @xmath0 features do not indicate large abundances of large grains ( see table 6 ) .",
    "we explore these issues more in section 5 .      in figures 12 - 14",
    ", we show the spectra and corresponding models to the rest of our sample , with eight spectra in each figure arranged top - to - bottom alphabetically by their names . for all of these spectra , the abundances of the various dust species required by the models are mixed .",
    "typically , no one dust type has an abundance required by its model much more than the abundances of any of the other dust types in that model .",
    "the spectrum of aa tau ( and others ) have what appear to be a broad emission feature at 14 @xmath0 , but this probably originates from gas emission @xcite ; also , sh and lh spectra of aa tau and a few other objects show unresolved emission lines from h@xmath2o and oh ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the models of fp tau , gi tau , and vy tau are broken into components in figures 12 , 13 , and 14 , respectively .",
    "note that fs tau and fv tau in figure 13 and gk tau , hn tau , and haro 6 - 28 in figure 14 suffer from the same lh order - tilt artifact as did haro 6 - 37 ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "also note the high point - to - point noise in the 20 - 25 @xmath0 parts of the ll spectra of ft tau , gg tau b , and gh tau in figure 13 and iq tau in figure 14 .",
    "this `` fringing '' artifact is due to the delamination of the ll order - sorting filter and shows up when the telescope has been mispointed with respect to a source in the direction perpendicular to the slit for a ll observation , with increasing severity of the artifact for greater mispointing of the telescope .",
    "there are some very narrow gaseous emission lines in our spectra .",
    "the spectra of dg tau ( figure 11 ) , dm tau ( figure 4 ) , and fs tau ( figure 13 ) all show 12.8 @xmath0 features arising from [ neii ]",
    ". this can affect identification of the silica component , as noted by @xcite with respect to the modeling by @xcite of tw hya .",
    "the presence of this feature in addition to a narrow feature at @xmath11 12.4 @xmath0 in the sl spectrum of tw hya led @xcite to conclude the presence of @xmath6-quartz , which has a double - peaked feature matching these two wavelengths .",
    "investigation of high - resolution spectra of tw hya showed that these two features belonged not to @xmath6-quartz but to the humphreys-@xmath6 hydrogen line ( hi n=7 - 6 ) at 12.37 @xmath0 and [ neii ] at 12.81 @xmath0 .",
    "c@xmath2h@xmath2 appears in the spectra of coku tau/3 ( figure 6 ) , df tau ( figure 11 ) , and dl tau ( figure 11 ) .",
    "this emission line is located at the more innocuous wavelength of 13.7 @xmath0 @xcite , and does not appear to have significantly affected the dust models of the spectra of these three objects . however , emission from hcn centered just longward of 14.0 @xmath0 @xcite is more problematic .",
    "examples of spectra with this feature are aa tau ( figure 12 ) , bp tau ( figure 12 ) , and it tau ( figure 11 ) .",
    "first , the feature occurs often in spectra taken with the sl and ll modules , which we splice together at precisely 14.00 @xmath0 .",
    "often there is a flux level mismatch between sl and ll at this wavelength , making establishing the reality of this feature difficult .",
    "second , the width of this feature varies .",
    "we have no dust component with an emission feature centered around 14 @xmath0 , so when the feature is wider , more data deviate from our model , worsening the model fit to the data .",
    "thirdly , observations of evolved stars in the large magellanic cloud @xcite sometimes show a feature at @xmath11 14 @xmath0 probably belonging to dust related to silicates .",
    "lastly , there are emission features near these wavelengths in spectra of calcium - aluminum inclusions in meteorites @xcite and in laboratory spectra of the melilite solid series @xcite , making identification of all of the 14 @xmath0 features with hcn emission more ambiguous .",
    "finally , emission lines of h@xmath2o have been discovered in high resolution _",
    "irs spectra of classical ttss in taurus , such as aa tau @xcite .",
    "these lines are found in its sh and lh spectra , especially past 25 um .",
    "many of these lines were found in the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum of the class 0 yso protostar ngc 1333 iras 4b @xcite .",
    "the lines are generally spread out over wavelength , but there are clumps of lines around 24.5 - 25.5 , 27.5 - 28.5 , and 30 - 31 @xmath0 wavelength .",
    "these water lines are unresolved , and our sh and lh spectra ( r @xmath11 600 ) have been rebinned to sl / ll resolution ( r @xmath11 90 ) , so the effect of the lines generally being distributed over all wavelengths in sh and lh is to raise slightly the level of the continuum above the continuum underneath the water lines in the high resolution spectra . the clumps at 25 , 28 , and 30.5 @xmath0 in the original high - resolution spectra , when rebinned , will show up as very slight @xmath11 0.5 @xmath0 wide bumps in the rebinned spectra .",
    "we typically see no prominent crystalline silicate features centered at either 25 or 30.5 @xmath0 in our spectra ( though dh tau has a small feature centered around 30.5 @xmath0 wavelength that has been attributed to enstatite before ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we do see many 28 @xmath0 features in our data .",
    "both the opacities of forsterite and enstatite have 28 @xmath0 complexes , the 28 @xmath0 complex of enstatite being more prominent with respect to its 23 and 33 @xmath0 complexes , so the net effect of not accounting for the water emission might be obtaining a enstatite abundance slightly too large .",
    "though we attempted to correct for extinction as explained in section 2 , two spectra proved to be difficult in this regard , those of fv tau ( figure 13 ) and coku tau/3 ( figure 6 ) . for fv tau , a@xmath4=5.33 , and for coku",
    "tau/3 , a@xmath4=5 . both were just under the upper limit of a@xmath4=6 above which we would not correct for extinction and therefore not model , and both spectra show absorption at 15.2 @xmath0 from co@xmath2 ice ; additionally , coku tau/3 has ice absorption features at 6.0 and 6.8 @xmath0 wavelengths as do heavily embedded class i ysos in taurus - auriga @xcite .",
    "though the model fit to the 10 @xmath0 complex of coku tau/3 is pretty good , the same is not true for fv tau .",
    "we suspect this to result from imperfect extinction correction . at longer wavelengths , however , the fit to fv tau ( excluding the region around the 15.2 @xmath0 co@xmath2 ice absorption feature ) is quite good , while the fit to the crystalline silicate complexes at 23 and 33 @xmath0 is only adequate . as any extinction correction at longer wavelengths is less than that for the 10 @xmath0 silicate complex , we attribute this not to a problem with extinction correction , but rather to the opacity used to fit forsterite , which is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "from the models for all 65 spectra , we computed the percentage of mass in a given dust grain species at one temperature out of all mass in dust at that temperature . with these mass percentages ,",
    "we compute histograms displaying both warm and cool dust mass percentages . the histograms for total warm and cool large grain mass fraction , total warm and cool crystalline grain mass fraction , warm and cool forsterite mass fraction , warm and cool enstatite mass fraction , and warm and cool silica mass fraction",
    "are given in fig .",
    "the test described and shown in appendix b of fitting a 5 @xmath0 radius heterogeneous grain profile with our standard model suggests that the abundance of crystalline grains could be underestimated by our standard models by up to 50% .",
    "in addition , it also suggests the large grain abundance could be slightly underestimated by 23% .",
    "the net effect of this bias is to underestimate the true crystalline and large grain abundances .",
    "figure 15a shows that the inner disk regions typically have much larger mass fraction in large grains than the outer disk regions .",
    "the mean and median in the histogram for warm large grains are around 50% ; for cool large grains , they are between 0 and 10 percent , though with a considerable `` tail '' up to 90% . noting that our 5 @xmath0 radius porous grains are very similar in shape of opacity to 2 @xmath0 solid grains @xcite , our average and median warm large grain mass fractions of 44% and 45% , respectively , compare favorably to the finding by @xcite of the average grain size for 1 - 2 myr old systems being between 1.5 and 2 @xmath0 radius ( as probed by the 10 @xmath0 feature ) .",
    "our average and median cool large grain mass fraction were 17% and 0% , respectively .",
    "figure 15b shows histograms of warm and cool crystalline dust mass fraction .",
    "both histograms peak at low percentages of about 5% for warm crystalline dust and about 12% for cool crystalline dust ( each of these percentages being the _ mode _ of the distribution ) , and there is considerable overlap .",
    "the cool crystalline dust histogram extends slightly to higher mass fraction bins , but we note the greater large grain mass fractions for the warmer inner disk regions . the average and median mass fractions for warm crystalline dust were 17% and 11% , respectively , and the average and median mass fractions for cool crystalline dust were 23% and 15% , respectively .",
    "greater large grain mass fractions can lead to slight underestimation of the crystalline abundance , so the amount of crystallinity in the inner disk regions could be higher and closer to that of outer disk regions .",
    "our findings of the mean , median , and mode of the warm crystalline dust mass fractions of 17% , 11% , and @xmath11 5% are consistent with those by @xcite , but they are slightly less consistent with those by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find typical warm crystalline dust mass fractions ( as probed by the 10 @xmath0 feature ) typically to be between 5 and 20% , regardless of system age , while @xcite find typical warm crystalline dust mass fractions to be between 5 and 7% .",
    "though crystalline mass fractions may be greater in the inner disk regions than outer disk regions ( see table 6 ) , the total mass of the cool dust in our models is between @xmath11 10 and 1000 times greater than that of the warm dust in the models .",
    "the total mass in crystalline silicates is often greater for the cool crystalline dust than the warm crystalline dust , as table 6 shows for v955 tau .",
    "the crystalline mass fractions for warm and cool crystals are 24.7% and 20.6% , respectively , being very similar .",
    "however , there is @xmath11 250 times more mass is cool dust than warm , so there is much more mass in 115k crystalline dust than in 488k crystalline dust according to the model .",
    "figures 15c , 15d , and 15e show the enstatite , forsterite , and silica mass fraction histograms . in figure 15c ,",
    "the warm enstatite mass fractions are very slightly displaced to larger values than the cool enstatite mass fractions .",
    "the previously discussed potential for slight underestimation of crystalline grain mass fraction for the inner disks due to greater grain growth reinforces our conclusion that the abundance of enstatite is greater in the inner disk regions .",
    "figure 15d shows that both the warm and cool forsterite mass fraction histograms show a peak in the lowest bin ; however , a large fraction of the cool forsterite distribution extends to greater mass fractions .",
    "first , we note the larger uncertainties in cool forsterite mass fractions than warm forsterite mass fractions ( table 6 ) .",
    "second , we once again note the potential to underestimate inner disk crystallinity .",
    "together , these two considerations suggest the warm forsterite abundance is similar to that of cool forsterite for our sample .",
    "figure 15e shows the same is true for silica as for forsterite ; for the same reasons as forsterite , the warm and cool silica abundances in our sample are similar .",
    "the higher relative abundance of enstatite over forsterite in inner disk regions than for outer disk regions was also found by @xcite .      in order to search for correlations between pairs of model parameters , stellar properties , and disk properties ,",
    "we have computed the linear correlation coefficient , r @xcite , and its corresponding probability , p , of finding a linear correlation coefficient of magnitude greater than or equal to these coefficients on a null data set , as above ( section 3.5 ) .",

    "note that scaling all dust mass weights by the same scalar less than unity would not change the correlation coefficient between two dust mass fractions .",
    "the uncertainty weighting of the correlation coefficient shows up in both numerator and denominator of the correlation coefficient @xcite to the same power , so the scalar applied in the denominator would divide the scalar applied in the numerator to give 1 times the original correlation coefficient . note that if r and the number , n , of data points that are being tested for correlation do not change , p will not change either because p depends only upon r and n. values of r that significantly deviate from zero and values of p close to zero suggest significant correlation or anticorrelation .",

    "lower @xmath6 means flatter submillimeter slope ( flux density at submillimeter wavelengths , f@xmath75 , is proportional to @xmath76 ) , implying that more growth of grains to millimeter sizes ( instead of sizes of a few microns ) accompanies a greater abundance of cool forsterite .",

    "these findings are similar to those of @xcite that greater warm olivine and warm silica , measured by o@xmath77 and s@xmath77 , respectively , anticorrelate with n@xmath72 and that greater warm enstatite , warm olivine , warm silica , and cool olivine ( warm enstatite and cool olivine being measured by p@xmath77 and o@xmath78 , respectively ) anticorrelate with n@xmath73 .",
    "the spectra described in section 1.6 ( low 10 @xmath0 complex equivalent width ) all indicate , with the exceptions of dg tau and v807 tau , highly settled systems with abundant crystalline silicates , though with relatively large uncertainties on these crystalline abundances .",
    "the settling of disks is interpreted here , as did @xcite and @xcite , as part of the evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the processing of dust into crystalline silicates is also interpreted as evolution of such disks .",
    "further , the models by @xcite predict crystalline mass fraction should be correlated with dust sedimentation both in inner and outer disk regions .",
    "therefore , the correlation of crystalline abundance with disk settling is expected as a general result of protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "warm and cool large grain abundances both anticorrelate with n@xmath73 .",
    "figure 20 shows the correlation between warm large grain abundance and n@xmath73 ( r=-0.36 and p=0.5% ) .",
    "this trend is interpreted as an increase in large grain abundance expected as a result of evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "figure 21 shows that cool large grain abundance also anticorrelates with n@xmath73 ( r=-0.32 and p=1.5% ) .",
    "@xcite found other tentative evidence for dust settling with grain growth .",
    "grain growth is , in fact , expected to be the cause of settling of dust in protoplanetary disks . from first - principles modeling , @xcite find in his simulations of grain growth and settling towards disk midplane of protoplanetary disks that at 60,000 years of evolution in the disk ( the initial diameter of their dust grains was 1 @xmath0 ) , at 30 au from the central star they find particles with diameters from one @xmath0 to near one centimeter .",
    "the range of ages assumed for class ii ysos in the taurus - auriga star - forming region is 1 - 2 myr , so substantial grain growth should have occurred for the 65 objects whose spectra are analyzed in this study .",
    "also , at a disk age of 0.1 myr , @xcite predicts that at a disk radius of 30 au , the dust - to - gas mass ratio at 6 au above the midplane should be 10@xmath81 what it was at time zero , when the disk was initially well - mixed , at the same location in the disk .",
    "this ratio of the dust - to - gas mass ratio to its initial well - mixed value is what @xcite call the settling parameter , @xmath82 . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the disk indices of some of the class ii ysos in the taurus - auriga star - forming region are consistent with such low values of @xmath82 ( 0.01 - 0.001 ) .",
    "@xcite also find that the differing morphology of irs spectra of ysos are consistent with dust growth and settling .",
    "large grain abundance anticorrelating with n@xmath73 is consistent with the expectation by @xcite of increasing grain growth over time and also greater settling of larger dust grains towards the disk midplane .    also significant",
    "is the result shown in figure 15a that more large grains are found in inner disk regions than outer disk regions .",
    "the observations and models by @xcite required more large grains for disk regions inside 2 au than for disk regions outside 2au for spectra of two of the three herbig ae / be stars they studied .",
    "@xcite find that the surface density of protoplanetary disks decreases with radius in the disks as r@xmath83 or r@xmath84 , so inner disk regions should be denser .",
    "this could encourage more rapid grain growth .    however , as noted previously , the correlations between large grain abundances and n@xmath73 are not very strong .",
    "one possible explanation for the weakness of correlation we find between warm large grain abundance and n@xmath73 is that we are not measuring the true large grain abundance from each spectrum because we do not account for differing amorphous - to - crystalline component ratios in the large inhomogeneous aggregate grains from system to system .",
    "the more crystalline components the average aggregate large grain in a given disk has , the less reliable a measure our large amorphous silicate grains are of the large grain extent in such disks @xcite .",
    "another possibility to explain the weakness of trend of warm large grain abundance with n@xmath73 is that sufficiently high turbulence prevents rapid grain growth and settling of few - micron - sized grains to the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "perhaps different disks can have the same degree of flattening but differing abundances of large grains in the optically thin surface layer .",
    "@xcite note that collisions replenish small grains .",
    "however , @xcite finds that turbulence can also encourage collisions that facilitate grain growth .",
    "these large grains , once formed , can be stored in a dead zone underneath the turbulent live zone , and can be protected even if the dead zone is disturbed by the live zone above it @xcite .",
    "warm large grain abundance also correlates with the known number of stars in the star system , with r=0.33 and p=0.7% , so perhaps multiplicity contributes to the dispersion seen in the trend between warm large grain abundance and n@xmath73 .",
    "figure 22 shows a comparison of the histogram of warm large grain abundance for single star systems and the same for multiple star systems - one immediately notices the higher large grain mass fractions for multiple systems than single systems .",
    "finally , figure 23 shows a fairly weak anticorrelation between warm large grain mass fraction and stellar mass , with r=-0.36 and p=0.5% .",
    "this may be related to the correlation between warm small amorphous grain mass fraction and stellar mass ( r=0.40 and p=0.1% ) . in our sample ,",
    "the spectra of low mass stars indicate higher levels of warm large grain abundance than for higher - mass stars .",
    "@xcite found in their study of six brown dwarf spectra higher mass fractions of crystalline grains for lower mass stars .",
    "they concluded that the region giving rise to the 10 @xmath0 feature was at smaller disk radii for less luminous , lower mass stars , and that in these innermost disk radii the crystalline dust abundance was higher .",
    "we interpret the trend of increasing warm ( inner disk ) large grain mass fraction with decreasing stellar mass similarly , in view of our finding of greater grain growth in inner disk regions than outer disk regions ( figure 15 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the dust composition of 65 t tauri stars using spectra from the irs on the _ spitzer space telescope_. these spectra show very prominent emission features and complexes at 10 , 16 , 19 , 23 , 28 , and 33 @xmath0 wavelengths , which are characteristic of silica and silicate grains ( both amorphous and crystalline ) with sizes from submicron to a few microns .",
    "we have constructed spectral models for each of the spectra that include , firstly , blackbodies at two temperatures and , secondly , planck functions at those two temperatures multiplied by scaled dust emissivities .",
    "these represent inner and outer disk emission from , firstly , the optically thick disk midplane and blackbody grains and , secondly , dust in the optically thin disk atmosphere with strong infrared resonances . the best fit for a given set of dust opacities",
    "is given by the pair of temperatures for which the global @xmath37 per degree of freedom is a minimum .",
    "we have tested the opacities on high - quality irs spectra to find the best opacities to represent emission from submicron grains of enstatite , forsterite , silica , and amorphous silicates and large ( few micron size ) grains in the protoplanetary disks of the taurus - auriga association .",
    "we conclude the following :    * high s / n spectra suggest the best crystalline silicate opacities to use in modeling are those of iron - poor pyroxene ( enstatite ) and iron - poor olivine ( forsterite ) .",
    "the best amorphous silicate opacities to use are those whose iron - to - magnesium ratios are nearly 1 ( cosmic ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finding by @xcite that cometary amorphous silicates require significant iron in their compositions in order to heat to inferred dust temperatures .",
    "the adopted amorphous silicate closely matches the heating of @xcite `` astronomical silicates '' . *",
    "though we use opacities of grains with 50% porosity and 5 @xmath0 radius of both amorphous pyroxene and amorphous olivine , calculations of the covariance between these components in models of various high s / n spectra show they are highly degenerate .",
    "this means our models can not readily distinguish between the two species as large grains , but our models are more sensitive to the sum of their masses .",
    "submicron amorphous pyroxene and submicron amorphous olivine are similarly degenerate but slightly less so .",
    "cool silica is degenerate with cool submicron amorphous silicates as they share 20 @xmath0 features .",
    "cool enstatite and cool forsterite are somewhat degenerate because they share prominent 23 , 28 , and 33 @xmath0 features ( only somewhat because the 28 @xmath0 feature of enstatite is relatively stronger than that of forsterite ) .",
    "* a few spectra of t tauri stars show evidence for extensive grain growth in that protoplanetary disks as indicated especially by their 10 @xmath0 complexes . * though most spectra are fit satisfactorily using our truncated cde forsterite opacity , a few are not .",
    "the deviations of the 10 , 23 , and 33 @xmath0 features between our models and the spectra suggest olivine grains of greater size , greater porosity , greater iron content ( namely , a nonzero iron content ) , or greater weighting towards extremely elongated or flattened grain shapes in the shape distribution are required , or some combination of these . *",
    "most spectra that require silica are fit well by the annealed silica opacity in the standard dust model mixture .",
    "the spectra of fz tau and dn tau suggest a silica polymorph other than annealed silica ( cristobalite and tridymite ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would provide a better fit to their spectra .",
    "this would imply different cooling rates for silica , once formed , than implied by the presence of the higher temperature polymorphs of silica @xcite .",
    "however , the 12.6 @xmath0 features of these two exceptional spectra are only mildly inconsistent with the annealed silica in the dust models , so the suggestion of an alternative silica polymorph is weak . *",
    "the models of the best enstatite exemplars , fn tau and dh tau , do not fit very well the strong crystalline silicate emission peaks at 28 and especially 33 @xmath0 , suggesting enstatite or forsterite dust at temperatures significantly lower than those used by our models is required by the data .",
    "it is unknown why such cold material is required to fit spectra indicating high enstatite abundance . *",
    "transitional and pre - transitional disks in this sample require negligible crystalline silicates and modest amounts of large grains ( dm tau being the exception , requiring significant large grains ) to fit their spectra relative to the rest of the disks whose spectra were analyzed in this study .",
    "a similar ( small ) number of spectra of systems not known to be transitional or pre - transitional also require high abundances of submicron amorphous silicates . *",
    "a few spectra have 10 @xmath0 complexes that have small equivalent widths .",
    "most of these are fit well by crystalline silicates as opposed to large grains , which is inconsistent with the idea that decreasing peak - to - continuum ratio of the 10 @xmath0 complex necessarily implies grain growth .",
    "* the goodness of fit of our models to the majority of our spectra means the opacities of large crystalline silicate grains are not typically required .",
    "this , in turn , implies that , if grains grow to larger sizes by agglomeration of grains of differing composition , then on average in the taurus - auriga yso population the more abundant subcomponents of these heterogeneous aggregate large grains are amorphous rather than crystalline . *",
    "higher abundances of large grains are found in inner disk regions than outer disk regions , suggesting grain growth occurs more rapidly in inner disk regions . *",
    "crystalline silicate abundances are very similar in the inner and outer disk regions .",
    "this contrasts interestingly with the finding by @xcite that regions inside 2 au in disks around herbig ae / be stars have much more processed dust than regions outside of 2 au .",
    "f04147 + 2822 exemplifies the contrast , having prominent 19 , 23 , 28 , and 33 @xmath0 complexes but very little indication of crystallinity based on its 10 @xmath0 complex .",
    "this suggests the inner region of this disk giving rise to the 10 @xmath0 complex has a lower abundance of crystals than the outer region giving rise to emission past 19 @xmath0 wavelength .",
    "* cool forsterite also correlates with flatter submillimeter seds , suggesting grain growth to millimeter sizes is more extensive for disks with more cool forsterite .",
    "* each crystalline silicate abundance always correlates positively and significantly with abundances of other crystalline silicate species .",
    "this suggests that whatever produces crystalline silicates does so at a faster rate than that at which any of the crystalline silicate species transform into any of the others .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that amorphous dust is processed into crystalline dust at a rate greater than one kind of crystalline silicate species can transform into another .",
    "* crystalline silicates in inner disk regions are more abundant for bluer , flatter disks , those with more advanced settling of dust grains towards disk midplane . * large grains in the inner disk regions",
    "are , on average , more abundant for more settled ( bluer ) disks .",
    "there is a fair degree of dispersion in the inner disk large grain abundance for a given degree of settling , suggesting different rates of settling of large grains in different disks .",
    "there is also an indication that the abundance of large grains in the inner disk correlates with known multiplicity of stellar system . *",
    "the spectra of disks around less massive stars indicate higher abundances of large grains in their inner disk regions .",

    "only mispointing in the dispersion direction ( perpendicular to the length of the slit ) could give rise to loss of flux .",
    "mispointing of the high resolution slits along the length of the slit ( spatial direction ) towards the center of the slit can actually result in obtaining more flux than is present if one does not consider the rsrfs used to calibrate flux were constructed from observations of flux standards at nominal nod positions .",
    "more flux enters through the slit if the target is positioned closer to the center of the slit than a nominal nod position ( like the flux calibrator is ) ; in this case , one must apply a scalar factor less than 1 to the affected nod spectrum to correct for the extra fraction of total signal from the target not measured for the calibrator .",

    "we have computed the effective complex dielectric function for material that is , by volume , 60% vacuum ( complex dielectric function equal to unity ) , 20% forsterite ( complex dielectric function by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 20% amorphous olivine mgfesio@xmath3 ( complex dielectric function by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as follows .",

    "this resulted in 3 sets of complex dielectric functions , one for each of the 3 crystallographic axes of forsterite , of material that is , by volume , 60% vacuum , 20% forsterite , and 20% amorphous olivine .",
    "next we computed opacities for each of the three sets of effective complex dielectric functions for rayleigh - limit - size spheres of these materials .",
    "finally , we averaged the three opacities together to account for anisotropy of optical constants ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for forsterite .",
    "we then calculated the flux density from 1 lunar mass of such grains 140 parsecs away at 300k .",
    "1% relative uncertainties were assumed , which are about the best we can expect from our sample of 65 spectra .    the 7.7 - 37 @xmath0 part of this spectrum was then modeled using our standard opacities , which are listed in the notes for table 6 , with the exception of using the opacities of forsterite and amorphous olivine grains in the cde shape distribution ( instead of tcde and cde2 ) .",
    "we used the cde for these two dust types in anticipation of the porous - cde correspondence reported by @xcite . in figure a1",
    ", we show the fit of the model to this test spectrum .",
    "although none of the dust opacities were precluded at the outset , the only opacities used were the cde opacities for forsterite and amorphous olivine , with masses of 0.45 and 0.43 m@xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the fit is very good to all wavelengths , though we note deviations for the strongest features at 11.4 , 19 , and 23 @xmath0 ; we also note that the correspondence between porous grain and cde opacities reported by @xcite was not perfect .",
    "the model used grains at 308k , only slightly different from the assumed 300k .",
    "this slightly higher than assumed temperature explains the slightly lower ( 0.88 m@xmath85 ) than assumed ( 1 m@xmath85 ) total mass of dust . we take this as support for the conclusion by @xcite that opacities of aggregates can be expressed as a sum of the opacities of homogeneous grains composed of the same materials as the aggregate s components , as applied to heterogeneous aggregates in the rayleigh size limit .",
    "next we conducted a similar test , but for large aggregates .",
    "we used the same effective complex dielectric function of vacuum , forsterite , and amorphous olivine in a 60/20/20 volume ratio as before but this time to compute opacities for 5 @xmath0 radius grains of the material .",
    "we computed the test spectrum assuming 1 lunar mass of grains at 300k located 140pc away .",
    "here , we used our standard opacities exactly as listed in the notes for table 6 , to gauge the effect of large grains in protoplanetary disks being aggregates of both amorphous and crystalline grains .",
    "dust at only one temperature was allowed , but no dust species at this temperature was precluded from the model at the outset .",
    "this time , the best - fit model dust temperature is lower , 264k , and enstatite is used in addition to forsterite and large ( 5 @xmath0 radius porous ) grains of amorphous olivine , though at a lower significance level than either the amorphous olivine or forsterite .",
    "we show this model in figure a2 .",
    "the total mass of the dust used by the model , 1.25 lunar masses , is a sum of 0.96 m@xmath85 of large amorphous olivine plus 0.20 m@xmath85 of forsterite , 0.09 m@xmath85 of enstatite , and 0.001 m@xmath85 of submicron amorphous pyroxene , which is somewhat greater than the mass assumed for the aggregates .",
    "this increase in mass was needed to compensate for the lower temperature .",
    "the model becomes an increasingly poorer fit at increasing wavelengths .",
    "part of this failure may be due to the use of the restricted shape distribution ( tcde ) for the forsterite instead of the more extreme shape distribution cde ( used previously to test the rayleigh - limit aggregate ) .",
    "an additional population of forsterite grains at a lower temperature than used may improve the fit .",
    "this suggests any serious failures of our standard model to fit spectra with prominent crystalline silicate features may imply a significant amount of grain growth of aggregate grains with significant crystalline silicate abundances ( here , 50% of the solid mass of the aggregate ) .",
    "this test also implies that the crystalline abundance could be underestimated by 50% ( 0.29/1.25 instead of 0.625/1.25 fractional abundance of crystalline silicates in heterogeneous aggregates ) of the true value , and it implies that the large grain abundance could be slightly underestimated ( 0.96 instead of 1.25 lunar masses of large ( 5 @xmath0 radius ) grains ) by 100@xmath69(0.29/1.25)% = 23% .",
    "we tested the necessity of using opacities of large grains in our models .",
    "we used our standard dust model on is tau , one of the objects whose spectrum was modeled using a significant amount of large grains , but we eliminated the opacities of large amorphous pyroxene and large amorphous olivine in the fit .",
    "the resulting model , shown in figure a3 , is a poorer fit to the 10 @xmath0 complex , not `` filling out '' the full width of the 10 @xmath0 complex .",
    "reduced @xmath37 for this large - grains - precluded model was 4.9 , which is 1.6 higher than the reduced @xmath37 of 3.3 for the model with large grains .",
    "we conclude the opacities of large amorphous grains are required in our models .",
    "we tested how sensitive our models are to the exact combination of porosity and grain size when we compute and use opacities of large grains in our models to detect grain growth . instead of 5 @xmath0 radius 60% porous grains , we computed opacities for 20 @xmath0 radius grains that are 88% porous .",
    "we chose this size to preserve the optical depth through the center of the grain .",
    "as noted by @xcite , 5 @xmath0 radius 60% porous grains were chosen to preserve the optical depth through the center of the 2 @xmath0 solid grains of amorphous olivine used by @xcite to represent grain growth in modeling spectra of herbig ae / be stars .",
    "this preservation of the optical depth through the center of the grain resulted in a close correspondence of the opacities of 5 @xmath0 radius porous grains and of 2 @xmath0 radius solid grains .",
    "although 90% vacuum ( by volume ) grains would be the logical extension 88% vacuum 20 @xmath0 radius grains proved to result in an opacity most like that of 5 @xmath0 radius 60% vacuum grains . as a test of this opacity , we modeled the spectrum of uz tau / e , noted in section 4 to require a large amount of large grains ; here , we replace the opacity of 5 @xmath0 60% porous grains of amorphous olivine with that of 20 @xmath0 88% porous grains of amorphous olivine .",
    "we show the best - fit model in figure a4 , compared to the model shown in figure 4 and described in section 4 .",
    "the fit is not much different , and the reduced @xmath37 is 5.6 instead of the 5.4 obtained with our standard opacities .",
    "therefore , we can not make precise statements on grain size and porosity individually for a given protoplanetary disk based only on the irs spectra .",

    "<S> mid - infrared spectra of 65 t tauri stars ( tts ) taken with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ are modeled using populations of optically thin dust at two temperatures to probe the radial variation in dust composition in the uppermost layers of protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> most spectra with narrow emission features associated with crystalline silicates require mg - rich minerals and silica , but a very small number suggest other components . </S>",
    "<S> spectra indicating large amounts of enstatite at higher temperatures ( 400 - 500k ) also require crystalline silicates , either enstatite or forsterite , at temperatures lower ( 100 - 200k ) than those required for spectra showing high abundance of other crystalline silicates . </S>",
    "<S> a few spectra show 10 @xmath0 complexes of very small equivalent width . </S>",
    "<S> they are fit well using abundant crystalline silicates but very few large grains , inconsistent with the expectation that low peak - to - continuum ratio of the 10 @xmath0 complex always indicates grain growth . </S>",
    "<S> most spectra in our sample are fit well without using the opacities of large crystalline silicate grains . </S>",
    "<S> if large grains grow by agglomeration of submicron grains of all dust types , the amorphous silicate components of these aggregates must typically be more abundant than the crystalline silicate components . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the more there is of one crystalline dust species , the more there is of the others . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that crystalline silicates are processed directly from amorphous silicates , whether by evaporation of the amorphous grains and condensation in chemical equilibrium or by annealing of the amorphous precursor grains . </S>",
    "<S> this also suggests that neither forsterite , enstatite , nor silica are intermediate steps along the way to producing either of the other two for the majority of the crystalline dust produced . </S>",
    "<S> crystalline silicate abundance is correlated tightly with disk geometry , in the sense of higher crystallinity accompanying more settled disks , which are commonly associated with growth and settling of grains . </S>",
    "<S> large - grain abundance is also correlated with disks that are more highly settled , but with a wide range of large grain abundance for a given degree of settling . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this range to mean that the settling of large grains is sensitive to individual disk properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that lower - mass stars have higher abundances of large grains in their inner regions .    0 _ </S>"
