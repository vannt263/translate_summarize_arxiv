    "quantum optics has been a fertile field for experimental tests of quantum information science .",
    "we expect that optical methods will be especially useful in applications that require the communication of quantum information over long distances .",
    "this has already been proven to be the case for quantum encryption .",
    "most research in this field has focused on the communication of single photon qubits . in this case",
    "the dominant source of decoherence is photon absorption , so errors can usually be avoided by engineering experiments that use some kind of coincidence counting .",
    "then , either all expected photons are observed , and no errors have occurred ; or some photons are absorbed , fewer photons are observed than expected , and the experiment must be repeated .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the communication of qubits that are encoded using multi - photon optical coherent states @xcite . because these are multiphoton states , they are more robust against small levels of absorption",
    ". however , the coherent state qubits exhibit their own errors , so we will later show how to correct these errors . to perform our error correcting procedure , we will need a resource of `` cat states '' of the form @xmath1 , beam splitters , and high efficiency photon counters .",
    "the coherent state @xmath2 is defined to be the eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath3 with eigenvalue @xmath4 , which may be any complex number .",
    "@xmath5 in the fock basis the coherent state has the decomposition @xmath6 and it is generated from the vacuum , @xmath7 , by the displacement operator @xmath8 . for a more thorough introduction to coherent states see @xcite for example .",
    "specifically we will consider two different methods of encodings qubits using coherent states .",
    "the first of these is the @xmath9 encoding , where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "an arbitrary qubit appears as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath15 . to simplify the notation , throughout the remainder of this paper , we assume @xmath4 is a real number .",
    "@xmath16 and is a normalization factor , made necessary because the states @xmath17 and @xmath2 are not exactly orthogonal , although for a sufficiently large @xmath4 ( say @xmath18 ) they are very nearly orthogonal ( @xmath19 ) . in the second encoding",
    "we will consider @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . using this @xmath22 encoding , we will represent an arbitrary qubit with @xmath23 both of these encoding require the same normalization factor , and we can easily translate from one encoding to the other by using the displacement operator @xmath24 .",
    "methods for performing universal logic operations on these qubits have already been discussed in @xcite , but we will briefly review the operations needed to correct the decoherence caused during long distance transmission .",
    "our first task is to characterize the type of errors that will effect the qubits as they travel through a long optical fiber .",
    "we assume photon loss is the dominant decoherence mechanism .",
    "this can be modeled by assuming some of the field is lost in transit via a beam splitter type interaction .",
    "the qubit enters one mode of the beam splitter , and the vacuum enters the other mode . after passing through the beam splitter",
    "some of the qubit s energy and information will be transfered to the second mode of the beam splitter and lost to the environment .",
    "only a single beam splitter is necessary to characterize the effects of any number of photon loss events and mechanisms . even though the photons will actually be lost to a myriad of different modes , our assumption that all photons are lost to a single mode is sufficient , because we must trace over this mode ( or these modes ) to calculate the state of the transmitted qubit .",
    "we will characterize the optical fiber used to transmit the qubit as having an exponential energy loss @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the loss coefficient of the fiber , and @xmath27 is the transmission distance .",
    "high grade commercial fibers typically have @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we will chose a beam splitter transmissivity of @xmath29 to study the decoherence behavior of both qubit encodings .",
    "after transmission the state of the qubit and the loss mode ( denoted with an @xmath30 ) becomes @xmath31 or @xmath32    one question which is natural to address at this point is `` which encoding method results in the greatest loss of information from the qubit mode ? ''",
    "it is tempting to think , because of the energy difference between the logical states in the @xmath33 ) encoding , that this encoding will suffer a catastrophic `` spontaneous emission '' type error under photon loss .",
    "however this is not correct as can be seen from the following argument .",
    "the state of the qubit mode after transmission is found by performing a trace over the loss mode .",
    "therefore we may perform any unitary operation on the loss mode , because that would just be equivalent to performing the trace using a different set of basis states .",
    "the amount of information in the qubit mode would be preserved under any unitary operation on that mode as well .",
    "one can easily see that if we apply @xmath34 to the qubit mode and @xmath35 to the loss mode in eq .",
    "( [ pm1 ] ) we obtain a state equal to that in eq .",
    "( [ 0alpha1 ] ) . by this argument",
    "we expect that both encodings should exhibit the same amount of decoherence .",
    "learning exactly how this decoherence is manifest will require closer inspection .",
    "we must find the final state of the qubit after transmission . because information was lost to the environment during transmission , the qubit is in a mixed state , and must be described by a density operator .",
    "we first construct a density operator for the qubit and loss modes , which is given by @xmath36 in the @xmath9 encoding . a partial trace over the loss mode @xmath30",
    "is performed by calculating @xmath37 without the need for any approximation we obtain @xcite @xmath38 which we can rewrite as @xmath39 the calculation for the @xmath22 encoding is similar and yields @xmath40 which is equivalent to @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the hermitian conjugate of the previous factor , and @xmath0 is the pauli @xmath0-operator defined by @xmath44 . from these calculations one can see that the decoherence of the qubits in both encodings is manifest in two ways .",
    "first the amplitude of the coherent states is changed from @xmath4 to @xmath45 .",
    "second with probability @xmath46 , the pauli @xmath0 operator is applied , producing a phase flip in the qubit basis .",
    "before we begin our discussion of how this decoherence can be corrected , we will first describe how to perform a few fundamental logic operations on the coherent state qubits .",
    "this will not be a universal set of logic gates but only the tools we need for error correction .",
    "_ displacement operator_. the displacement operator can be simulated by sending a qubit into a highly transmissive beam splitter along with a high amplitude coherent state .",
    "the beam splitter performs the unitary transformation @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the annihilation operators for the two modes entering the beam splitter , and the transmissivity is given by @xmath50 . for example , suppose the qubit modes is in state @xmath2 , and we send it and a second mode in the state @xmath51 into a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath52 .",
    "this produces @xmath53 in the limit that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , this interactions produces @xmath57 on the qubit .",
    "this can be seen by performing a trace over the second mode in the above expression and taking the appropriate limits . because @xmath58 is just a coherent state ( _ not _ a superposition of two coherent states ) it is not difficult to approximate the limit @xmath54 .",
    "we can now use this technique to translate between the two qubit encodings with negligible decoherence .",
    "_ bit - flip gate . _",
    "the bit - flip gate performs the operation @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the @xmath9 encoding .",
    "it is equivalent to the logical not operation or the pauli @xmath61 matrix in the logical qubit basis . to achieve this transformation",
    "we simply apply the hamiltonian for free space evolution @xmath62 for a time @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the frequency of the light .",
    "this produces the unitary operator @xmath65 we can easily apply this hamiltonian by delaying the flight of the qubit by one half cycle with respect to the local oscillator field .",
    "note that we can perform @xmath61 for qubits in the @xmath22 basis with the combination @xmath66    _ bell state preparation .",
    "_ many of the operations of a coherent state quantum computer , especially those based on quantum teleportation , require the use of bell states of the form @xmath67 the preparation of these bell states is a nontrivial matter .",
    "a bell state can be made by creating a `` cat state '' of the form @xmath68 , and sending the cat state and the vacuum into the two input ports of a 50/50 beam splitter @xmath69 .",
    "then the beam splitter s output ports will contain the two entangled modes of the bell state .",
    "therefore the problem of generating bell states is reduced to the construction of a source of cat states .",
    "cat states can be produced by sending a coherent state into a nonlinear medium exhibiting the kerr effect@xcite .",
    "although sufficiently large kerr nonlinearities have been difficult to produce , significant progress is being made in this area . for a discussion of an experiment demonstrating the observation of the kerr effect see @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to produce approximate cat states using a squeezing interaction , linear optical devices , and photon counters @xcite .",
    "the success of these methods depends on detecting a particular number of photons in the photon counter , so for a single attempt there is a small probability to produce a high fidelity cat state .",
    "_ calculate that a cat state with a fidelity of @xmath70 can be produced with a probability greater than @xmath71 .",
    "this presents the technical problem of constructing a system which can rapidly repeat cat state production attempts ( or can simultaneously perform many attempts ) , so that cat states can be had on demand .",
    "the greatest challenge to this cat state production technique is that it relies on very high efficiency photon detectors which can distinguish between for example 5 , 6 , or 7 photons . while such photon detectors do not yet exist , this is also a very promising field of research . for a demonstration of a high efficiency photon counter see @xcite .",
    "a promising new method to produce cat states was recently proposed by lund _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "they explain how high amplitude cat states can be produced from squeezed single photon states , using beam splitters and inefficient photon detectors .",
    "this scheme also has a large probability of failure during a given attempt to produce a cat , but it can be implemented with current photon detectors .",
    "it appears likely that the production of cat states ( and bell states ) is a goal that is achievable in the near future .",
    "_ teleportation and z. _ quantum teleportation is a surprisingly straightforward procedure for coherent state qubits",
    "it is an essential tool for performing many logic operations on coherent state qubits , and we will later show how it can be used to correct the amplitude lost during qubit transmission .    to perform the teleportation in the @xmath9 encoding ,",

    "suppose alice wants to transmit her qubit to bob . rather than encoding her qubit against @xmath0 errors and sending the three qubits to bob , she could prepare a large collection of bell states .",
    "she then sends one half of each bell pair to bob through their long optical fiber .",
    "the bell states will suffer some decoherence during the transmission , so alice and bob must purify the states . a method for purification of bell states ( made of coherent states of light )",
    "is published in @xcite .",
    "a much more thorough discussion of the connections between error correction codes and purification of bell states can be found in @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we have also discussed a number of connections between the two methods used to encode qubits onto coherent states : the encoding whose logical @xmath7 and @xmath125 states are the optical coherent states @xmath17 and @xmath2 , and the encoding whose logical states are @xmath7 ( the vacuum state ) and @xmath158 .",
    "we can transform a qubit from one encoding to another by using the displacement operator @xmath24 .",
    "both encodings suffer from the same forms of decoherence at the same rates . the probability to teleport a qubit",
    "does not depend on its encoding . in a future publication",
    "we hope to discuss the performance of logic operations on both encodings and how the freedom offered by the displacement operator can increase the efficiency of calculations .    in this paper",
    "we have not discussed the effects of any optical nonlinearities during transmission of the qubit . however , the nonlinearities of fiber - optic cables at these low light levels are negligible . of a much greater concern",
    "is a need for high quality photon counters and a source of cat states .",
    "these are required for the measurements during the error correction and teleportation procedures and for the production of bell states .",
    "because of the great utility of photon counters and cat states , we encourage experimenters to continue their work on these devices .",
