    "when a molecule is subject to an intense laser field , a series of related strong - field processes may occur , including ionization , dissociation and high - harmonic generation .",
    "as for atoms , it is essential to obtain a detailed understanding of the initial , single - ionization process in order to describe the subsequent evolution of the system . fully _ ab initio _ calculations of the strong - field ionization of any molecule more complicated than h@xmath0 are impossible in the foreseeable future .",
    "hence , theories of general practical use have to rely on theoretical modelling and it is the purpose of the present work to investigate the accuracy of such models . while the quality of _ ab initio _ calculations may be checked numerically by studies of convergence and by identity of results in different gauges , the quality of an approximate model has to be checked against a more accurate model or experimental data .    in the study of strong - field ionization of molecules ,",
    "three models are widely used .",
    "these are the velocity gauge ( vg ) molecular strong - field approximation ( mo - sfa vg ) @xcite , the length gauge ( lg ) mo - sfa ( mo - sfa lg ) @xcite , and the molecular tunneling theory @xcite .",
    "the latter theory is an extension of the atomic ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) tunneling theory @xcite generalized to take into account the non - spherical symmetry of the molecular system and it is referred to as the mo - adk theory .",
    "the mo - sfa vg and mo - sfa lg theories are the velocity gauge and length gauge versions of the keldysh - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) atomic theories @xcite appropriately modified to the molecular case . in short ,",
    "the mo - sfa theories are based on an _",
    "s_-matrix formulation where one considers the transition from a field - free initial state to a volkov final state , i.e. , the state of a free electron in the laser field .    to assess the quality of the models , predictions have been compared with experimental data ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , data has been studied in detail which compares ionization yields of diatomic molecules with yields of atoms having nearly the same electronic binding as the molecules  the so - called companion atoms .",
    "the ratio of ion signal data of diatomic molecules and their companion atoms @xcite is illuminating since effects are factored out which depend only on the binding energy .",
    "hence a comparison of the ratio of ionization signal of , e.g. , n@xmath0 and its companion ar atom allows one to study fairly directly effects of molecular symmetry and ro - vibrational motion . in ref .",
    "@xcite the status of theory versus experiments was discussed : the mo - adk theory @xcite gave results in satisfactory agreement with experiments for molecules with suppressed ionization : d@xmath0:ar @xcite , o@xmath0:xe @xcite and without : n@xmath0:ar @xcite .",
    "for the f@xmath0:ar ratio , the mo - adk theory predicts suppression of the molecular signal while the experimental data @xcite does not . for the f@xmath0 molecule",
    ", however , the total energy obtained from a hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation of the molecular system is higher than the energy of the separated atoms @xcite .",
    "this means that electron correlation effects are important for the proper description of the binding of f@xmath0 , and , accordingly , the one - electron model taken as the starting point for the mo - adk ( and the mo - sfa ) theory , is not applicable .",
    "the models discussed above , and in the present paper , can only be meaningfully applied on molecular systems where effects of electron - electron correlation are small @xcite .",
    "methods which do take electron - electron correlation into account are presently under development @xcite but these methods are not yet applicable to molecules interacting with oscillating fields in geometries without cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the mo - sfa vg was compared with experiments in ref .",
    "the theory was shown to predict suppressed ionization of o@xmath0:xe @xcite and to predict ` absence ' of suppressed ionization in n@xmath0:ar @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions of the mo - sfa vg were compared with experimental above - threshold - ionization spectra of o@xmath0 ( @xmath1 symmetry ) and n@xmath0 ( @xmath2 symmetry ) and for these systems the theory gave the correct qualitative predictions .    in general ,",
    "the mo - sfa vg approximation predicts suppressed ionization for diatomic molecules with an antibonding highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and it predicts no suppression of the ionization of diatoms with a bonding homo .",
    "these general predictions are based on an analysis of the mo - sfa vg rate in terms of linear combinations of atomic orbitals where the antibonding [ bonding ] rate is proportional to @xmath3 @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum of the outgoing electron and @xmath7 the internuclear coordinate .",
    "for example , the mo - sfa vg approximation predicts suppressed ionization for o@xmath0 with a homo of @xmath1 symmetry and no suppression of the d@xmath0:ar signal .",
    "this latter prediction is in contrast with experimental observation @xcite and mo - adk theory @xcite , and we shall return to this discrepancy below .    in view of the above discussion at least two questions",
    "need to be investigated in more detail .",
    "firstly , what is the quantitative prediction of the mo - sfa in the d@xmath0:ar case ?",
    "secondly , is it possible to carry out a calculation in a more accurate approximation which sheds some light on the discrepancy between the mo - adk calculations of ref .",

    "@xcite ? to address related questions",
    "we have recently developed the necessary tools for computations in the velocity and length gauge formulations of the mo - sfa , and in addition we have set up a programme for the evaluation of the molecular tunneling theory @xcite .",
    "our lg and vg versions of the mo - sfa are generalizations of the atomic adiabatic theory @xcite .",
    "our formulation of the mo - adk theory follows ref .",
    "@xcite , but our method of extracting the angular coefficients of relevance for the evaluation of the rate is different @xcite . in this work , we extend our previous analysis , by taking effects of nuclear motion explicitly into account and we show that the inclusion of nuclear vibrations may lead to a significantly lower rate . for the molecules considered in this paper nuclear motion is of significant importance for d@xmath0 and no while it leads to small effects in the final results for the other molecules studied .",

    "contrary , in the mo - adk there is no detailed specification of the final state in the strong - field ionization process , and in order to maintain a quasistatic tunneling picture one must fix the nuclei at an internuclear distance @xmath8 and let the electron move in the @xmath8-dependent potential .      in the coulomb gauge and in the dipole approximation",

    "such an effect is not present in the velocity gauge amplitude .    to account for the coulomb interaction between the outgoing electron and the residual molecular ion one",

    "we explain the absense of a coulomb interaction in the length gauge by the fact that the transition to the continuum occurs at large distances . in this spatial region",
    "the laser - electron interaction is stronger than the electron - ion interaction and the volkov state is a good approximation for the final state .",
    "in addition to the coulomb correction factor , we multiply the rates by the number of equivalent electrons in the homo . finally , to obtain the total ionization rate of the molecules",

    "the results of the mo - sfa lg model agreed better with the experiments .",
    "this is interesting in view of recent experiments @xcite which reported suppression of strong - field ionization for transition metal atoms relative to expectations , but only compared with tunneling theory , and not sfa . for the future work it would be interesting to check the sfa lg model on the transition metals to investigate if the suppression is due to a general breakdown of the single - active electron models or if it is due only to a failure of the adk model .",
