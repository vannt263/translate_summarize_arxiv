[",
    "img : waveellorzoominblackred ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the wave propagation to the east ( 78 and 911 ) and to the west ( 13 and 46 ) can be attributed to two different source sites .",
    "accordingly , the wave kinematics are derived using two different source site coordinates .    to derive the wave kinematics , we calculated for each point of the wavefronts its distance from the respective radiant point along great circles on the solar surface , and then averaged over all points of the wavefront . figure  [ img : velocityallresult ]",

    "the wave was first visible at a distance of @xmath1890  mm from the wave s radiant point in direction 1@xmath133 , and can be followed up to distances of 500600  mm in the different directions . in direction 4@xmath136 , the winking of a filament can be observed after the wave passage ( @xmath1811:04  ut ) , which makes the wavefront determination difficult for this phase .",
    "linear and quadratic functions are fitted to the derived kinematical curves of the wave ( see fig .  [ img : velocityallresult ] ) , from which we extrapolated the start times , ranging from 10:59:40 to 11:01:40  ut .",

    "the moreton wave propagation was followed by analyzing the perturbation intensity - profiles @xmath27 .",
    "it has to be noted that the perturbation profile analysis can only be carried out if the disturbance is strong enough ( see examples in * ? ? ?",
    "moreton waves are in most cases too faint and irregular to be analyzed by this method .",
    "we also note that there are simplifying assumptions involved in the profile method : it is supposed that the ambient medium is homogeneous and the wavefronts expand circularly .",
    "+ first of all , a specific sector is chosen for which the intensity evolution is calculated .",
    "then the intensity values are averaged over annuli with a chosen angular width and a thickness of 5  mm .",
    "this results in a mean intensity as a function of distance @xmath28 ( measured along the solar chromosphere ) from the wave s radiant point .",
    "the procedure is repeated for each filtergram , until the moreton wave fades away .",
    "since we investigate intensity changes @xmath29 , we use the blue - minus - red wing base - difference images , where the wave contrast is best .    the method was carried out for the directions 9@xmath1311 and 4@xmath136 because of their high intensities and their rather constant sector spans .",
    "however , the wavefronts become more and more irregular and show noticeable changes in their shape and propagation direction . thus , with the profile method we can track the wave over shorter distances than with the visual method .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it provides us with more information on the perturbation characteristics .",

    "we derived the wave kinematics . figure  [ img : intvelocitylast ] shows the time - distance plots of the moreton wave derived from the profile method , in comparison with the curves derived from the visual method .",
    "the extrapolated start times lie in the range of 11:00:4011:01:50  ut , and correspond well to the starting times derived from the visual method .",
    "for the direction 9@xmath1311 , the mean velocities derived from the linear fits are 1320  km  s@xmath1 , 1270  km  s@xmath1 and 1230  km  s@xmath1 for @xmath30 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the values for orientation 4@xmath136 are 1140  km  s@xmath1 , 1040  km  s@xmath1 and 850  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocities derived by the profile method differ from those derived from the visual - method . however , this difference is not a result from the different methods , but merely results from the fact that with the profile method the late - phase evolution of the wave , when it has already decelerated , can not be extracted . using an identical time range for the fitting procedure for both methods ( orientation 911 : 11:02  ut ",
    "11:06  ut ; orientation 46 : 11:04  ut  11:09  ut ) , we obtain from the visual method mean velocities of 1280  km  s@xmath1 and 1070  km  s@xmath1 , which is consistent with the velocities obtained from the profile method ( peak amplitude ) for the two sectors ( cf.fig .",

    "the first value is determined from the type  ii occurrence , while the second value is given by the first moreton wavefront appearance in this direction .    a strong relation between the cme lateral expansion and the occurrence of coronal shock waves",
    "was already suggested by radio observations .",
    "@xcite reported about a halo cme event , accompanied by a moreton and an eit wave , in which the appearance of new radio sources were attributed to the arc expansion of the cme magnetic field .",
    "finally , the encounter of the propagating wave with magnetic field structures caused the opening of field lines .",
    "@xcite related the systematic occurrence of radio sources during the early evolution of a cme to the successive destabilization or interaction of loop systems which resulted in large - scale coronal restructering and finally cme formation .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn by @xcite comparing the moreton wave observations of january , 17 2005 and the related type ii burst resulting in an outcoming analytical mhd model .",
    "it can be presumed that at low heights the coronal shock is a quasi - perpendicular fast - mode mhd shock @xcite .",
    "considering jump relations at the perpendicular shock front ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the shock magnetosonic mach number @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the coronal shock velocity and @xmath50 the magnetosonic speed ) can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ambient coronal plasma - to - magnetic pressure ratio and @xmath53 the density jump at the shock front . for the specific - heat ratio ( the polytropic index ) we have taken @xmath54 . using @xmath461.56 for the density jump , as derived from the type ii band - split observations ( cf.sect .",
    "3.6 ) , we find @xmath551.42 for @xmath56 , and @xmath571.45 for @xmath58 .    the pressure jump at the shock front , @xmath59 , can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the sound mach number of the coronal shock , which for @xmath54 reads : @xmath62 using @xmath461.56 , we find @xmath639.34 for @xmath58 , and @xmath642.22 for @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the type ii burst observations indicate that the pressure jump ranges between @xmath182 and 10 .",
    "the pressure jump at the shock front causes an abrupt pressure increase at the top of a given chromospheric element after the shock sweeps over it .",
    "consequently , also a pressure discontinuity forms between the perturbed corona and the yet undisturbed chromosphere .",
    "the appearance of the pressure discontinuity at the top of the chromosphere implies that a downward - traveling shock should be formed . behind the shock front",
    "the plasma is compressed and moves downwards ( including the corona / chromosphere `` interface '' ) . as the shock penetrates deeper , a successively larger portion of the chromosphere is compressed and set into motion , increasing the h@xmath7 blue - minus - red doppler signal at the leading part of the moreton wave .",
    "@xcite obtained from a cme case study that the speed and density of the cme front and flanks , derived from coronagraphic white light images , were consistent with the existence of a shock .",
    "comparison of the observations with mhd simulations confirmed that the observed wave feature is a density enhancement from a fast - mode mhd shock ( for further similar white light observations of coronal shocks see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found from radio imaging observations that the emitting sources of type  iii bursts were located at the compression region between the cme flanks and the neighboring open field lines .",
    "the compression region was revealed as a narrow feature in white light , and was interpreted as a coronal shock driven by the cme lateral expansion .",
    "it is occasionally also observed as a type  iv - like burst propagating colaterally with the moreton wave @xcite . especially important",
    "are observations of broadening and intensity changes of uv emission lines in front of cmes , associated with type ii bursts , since such measurements provide an insight into the physical state of plasma in the compression region @xcite .",
    "occasionally , the plasma parameters can be inferred also from the soft x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the intense morton wave of october 28 , 2003 together with its associated phenomena : the x17.2/4b flare event , the fast halo cme ( @xmath21  2500  km  s@xmath1 ) , the eit wave , the radio type ii burst , and coronal dimmings , in order to study the wave characteristics and its driver .",
    "the main findings of the study and our interpretation are summarized in the following :    1 .",
    "the moreton wave propagates in almost all directions over the whole solar disk , and can be observed for a period as long as 11  min ( during 11:0211:13  ut ) .",
    "these are both unusual properties of a moreton wave .",
    "but we note that a wave with similar characteristics ( global propagation , @xmath21  1100@xmath131200  km  s@xmath1 ) was launched from the same ar on 2003 october 29 in assocation with an x10 flare / cme event @xcite .",
    "we studied the wave kinematics in detail for four different propagation directions finding mean velocities in the range 9001100  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "typical values of the sound speed and the alfv@xmath65n speed in the solar corona are 180  km  s@xmath1 and 300500  km  s@xmath1 ( mann et al .",
    "1999 ) , respectively , which corresponds to a magnetosonic mach number of @xmath1823 of the moreton wave under study , if interpreted as a propagating fast - mode shock .",
    "the band - split of the associated type ii burst was determined to 0.150.25 , from which we inferred magnetosonic mach number @xmath66 .",
    "we find two radiant points ( source centers ) for the moreton wave on opposite east - west edges of the source active region ( ar  10486 ) .",
    "this has not been reported before and indicates that either two independent waves were launched simultaneously , or that the wave was caused by the expansion of an extended source with a preferred axis .",
    "the associated coronal wave ( `` eit wave '' ) was observed by the eit instrument in one frame .",
    "the determined eit wavefront lies on the extrapolated kinematical curve of the moreton wave , identifying both the eit wave and the h@xmath7 moreton wave as different signatures of the same disturbance , according to uchida s theory .",
    "4 .   in two propagation directions ,",
    "a deceleration of @xmath67  m  s@xmath26 and @xmath68  m  s@xmath26 was observed in the distance - time diagrams of the h@xmath7 moreton wavefronts . in the initial phase ,",
    "the perturbation profiles show amplitude growth and steepening of the disturbance .",
    "later on , they display a broadening , amplitude decrease , and signatures of chromospheric relaxation appear at the trailing segment of the disturbance .",
    "this indicates that the coronal perturbation is a freely propagating large - amplitude simple - wave .",
    "the width of the disturbance is in the range of 50150  mm .",
    "the extrapolated start time of the wave fits roughly with the extrapolated start time of the cme observed in lasco ( but we note that the uncertainty of the cme start time is of the order of 10  min ) but occurs slightly before ( 2  min ) the first hxr peak of the flare impulsive phase ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ img : plot_hxr ] ) . 6 .",
    "the associated bipolar coronal dimmings , which are generally interpreted as footprints of the expanding cme and associated coronal mass depletion , appear on the same opposite east - west edges of ar  10486 as the moreton wave ignition centers do .",
    "the bipolar dimmings show a fast increase during the impulsive phase , followed by a much slower evolution , which indicates a characteristic restricted growth .",
    "the expansion velocity of the dimming region is @xmath18100  km  s@xmath1 at the time , where the moreton wave is launched .",
    "the position of the type ii burst source is co - spatial with the moreton wavefront in direction 4@xmath136 .",
    "the back - extrapolated start time for the type ii burst is @xmath1811:02:30  ut , i.e. , somewhat later than the start time derived for the moreton wave with respect to its radiant point .",
    "this suggests that the perturbation was not launched from a point - like source but from an extended source whose surface was at a distance @xmath6960  mm from the back - extrapolated radiant point .",
    "the launch time of the type ii burst , which indicates the shock front formation , and the moreton wave perturbation profile steepening coincide within the measurement errors .    from several case studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it was derived that radio as well as white light signatures in coronagraphs provide evidence that the lateral expansion of a cme is able to produce shocks in the corona .",
    "the results of the study , presented in this paper , support a scenario in which the launch of the observed moreton and eit wave is initiated by the lateral expansion of the cme .",
    "in such a case we expect that the perturbation is driven only over a short time / distance , as the cme lateral - expansion range is limited ( for the theoretical background see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the disturbance would evolve into a freely propagating wave , which is consistent with the observed perturbation characteristics .",
    "the behavior of cme expansion ( radial and lateral direction ) at low coronal heights might be an important condition for the formation of coronal shock waves .",
