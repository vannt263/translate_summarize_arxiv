    "fluctuations of the current in mesoscopic conductors originate from the quantum scattering of the charge carriers , and are sensitive to their interference , statistics and interaction .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "statistical correlations in the transport of fermions have led to a number of interesting predictions .",
    "for example , the noise of a single - channel quantum contact of transparency @xmath2 at zero temperature has the form @xmath3 @xcite . the noise is thus suppressed below the schottky value @xmath4 of uncorrelated charge transfer .",
    "the suppression is a direct consequence of the pauli principle , which prevents two electrons from tunneling together .",
    "it is convenient to measure the deviation from the schottky result by the so - called fano factor @xmath5 . for a number of generic conductors ,",
    "it turns out that the suppression of the fano factor is universal , i.  e. it does not depend on details of the conductor like geometry or impurity concentration .",
    "in particular , a diffusive metal with elastic scattering leads to @xmath6 @xcite , which is independent on the concrete shape of the conductor @xcite and has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "if superconductivity comes into play the fundamental charge transport mechanism at energies below the superconducting gap is andreev reflection .",
    "two electrons enter the superconductor simultaneously and form a cooper pair , which can propagate in the superconductor .",
    "thus , in this process a charge transfer of @xmath7 occurs , but with a reduced probability , since two particles have to tunnel .",
    "the shot noise is proportional to the charge of the elementary processes , and one thus naivly expects a doubling of the shot noise , which was indeed found theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite for diffusive conductors .",
    "it is remarkable that this doubling occurs for diffusive conductors , whereas it is not found for other conductors like , e.  g. , single - channel contacts @xcite , double tunnel junctions @xcite , or diffusive junctions with a tunneling barrier @xcite .",
    "a doubling of the full schottky noise was recently observed experimentally @xcite .    in this article",
    "we address the counting statistics and the noise in diffusive structures with normal and/or superconducting terminals .",
    "in particular we concentrate on the energy- and phase - dependent shot noise in an andreev interferometer .",
    "first , we briefly review the theory of full counting statistics using the keldysh green s function approach .",

    "3 we obtain generic results for the shot noise in diffusive conductors in some limiting cases . finally , in secs .  4 and 5",
    "we discuss the information contained in the energy- and phase - dependence of the shot noise in diffusive wires and andreev interferometers .",
    "a good qualitative agreement of experimental results and our full quantum calculation is demonstrated .",
    "consider the following gedanken experiment . a constant voltage bias is applied to a mesoscopic conductor for a certain time interval @xmath8 . during this time interval we count the number of charges @xmath9 passing the conductor .",
    "due to quantum - mechanical uncertainty the outcome of the experiment is described by a probability @xmath10 that @xmath9 charges have passed the conductor .",
