    "magnetic fields need illumination to be detectable . _ polarized emission _  at optical , infrared , submillimeter and radio wavelengths holds the clue to measure magnetic fields in galaxies .",

    "spectral lines directly measures the field strength in gas clouds of the milky way @xcite and in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the intensity of _ synchrotron emission _  is a measure of the density of cosmic - ray electrons in the relevant energy range and of the strength of the total field component in the sky plane .",
    "the assumption of energy equipartition between these two components allows us to calculate the total magnetic field strength from the synchrotron intensity @xcite .",
    "linearly polarized synchrotron emission emerges from ordered fields in the sky plane .",
    "as polarization `` vectors '' are ambiguous by @xmath8 , they can not distinguish _ regular ( coherent ) fields _ , defined to have a constant direction within the telescope beam , from _ anisotropic fields _ , which are generated from turbulent fields by compressing or shearing gas flows and frequently reverse their direction within the telescope beam .",
    "unpolarized synchrotron emission indicates _ turbulent ( random ) fields _ which have random directions in 3-d and have been amplified and tangled by turbulent gas flows .",
    "the intrinsic degree of linear polarization of synchrotron emission is about 75% .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is smaller due to the contribution of unpolarized thermal emission , which may dominate in star - forming regions , by _ faraday depolarization _  along the line of sight and across the beam @xcite , and by geometrical depolarization due to variations of the field orientation within the beam .",
    "the polarization vector is rotated in a magnetized thermal plasma by _",

    "as the rotation angle is sensitive to the sign of the field direction , only regular fields give rise to faraday rotation , while anisotropic and random fields do not .",
    "measurements of the faraday rotation from multi - wavelength observations allow to determine the strength and direction of the regular field component along the line of sight .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath10 is proportional to the square of the wavelength @xmath11 and the _ faraday depth ( fd ) _ , defined as the line - of - sight integral over the product of the plasma density and the strength of the field component along the line of sight .",

    "if the medium has a simple magnetic structure , its 3-d structure can be determined ( _ faraday tomography _ ) .",
    "a _ grid of rm measurements of polarized background sources _",
    "is another tool to study magnetic field patterns in galaxies @xcite and in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "a large number of sources is required to recognize the field patterns , to separate the galactic foreground contribution and to account for intrinsic rms of the background sources .",
    "the combination of observations of diffuse polarized emission and rm can be used as a test of _ magnetic helicity_@xcite .",
    "the typical average _ equipartition strength _  of the total magnetic field @xcite in spiral galaxies is about @xmath15 g , assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields .",
    "radio - faint galaxies like m  31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m31 ] ) and m  33 @xcite , our milky way s neighbors , have weaker total magnetic fields ( about @xmath16 g ) , while gas - rich spiral galaxies with high star - formation rates , like m  51 and ngc  6946 ( fig .",

    "the strongest total fields of @xmath18 g are found in starburst galaxies , like m  82 @xcite and the `` antennae '' ngc  4038/9 @xcite , and in nuclear starburst regions , like in the centers of ngc  1097 and other barred galaxies @xcite .    if energy losses of cosmic - ray electrons are significant , especially in starburst regions or massive spiral arms , the equipartition values are lower limits @xcite and are probably underestimated in starburst galaxies by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "field strengths of @xmath19  mg were detected in starburst galaxies by the zeeman effect in the oh megamaser emission line at 18  cm @xcite .",
    "these values refer to highly compressed gas clouds and are not typical for the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the relative importance of various competing forces in the interstellar medium are estimated by comparing _",

    "[ fig : n6946_energies ] ) and m  33 are @xmath20  erg  @xmath21 and @xmath22  erg  @xmath21 , respectively @xcite , similar to that of the turbulent gas motions in the star - forming disk , about 10 times larger than that of the ionized gas ( _ low - beta plasma _ ) .",
    "magnetic fields are dynamically important .",
    "the total magnetic energy density may even dominate in the outer galaxy where the equipartition field strength is an underestimate due to energy losses of the cosmic - ray electrons . the energy density of the regular magnetic field decreases even more slowly than that of the total field , possibly because the mean - field dynamo still efficiently operates in the outer disk .",
    "although the star - formation activity is low here , the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) may serve as the source of turbulence required for dynamo action @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the total radio continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths ( frequencies of a few ghz ) , which is mostly of nonthermal synchrotron origin , and the far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of star - forming galaxies are tightly correlated .",
    "this correlation is one of the tightest correlations known in astronomy .",
    "it extends over five orders of magnitude @xcite and is valid in starburst galaxies to redshifts of at least 3 @xcite .",
    "hence the total radio emission can serve as a tracer of magnetic fields and of star formation out to large distances .",
    "the correlation requires that total ( mostly turbulent ) magnetic fields and star formation are connected , so that the field strength exceeds several 100  @xmath0 g in distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "the tightness needs multiple feedback mechanisms which are not yet understood @xcite .",
    "the total radio and far - infrared ( fir ) or mid - ir ( mir ) intensities are also highly correlated within galaxies .",
    "the exponent of the correlation in m  51 was found to be different in the central region , spiral arms and interarm regions @xcite .",
    "the radio  infrared correlation can be presented as a correlation between turbulent field strength and star - formation rate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the ordered field is either uncorrelated with the star - formation rate , or anticorrelated in galaxies where the ordered field is strongest in interarm regions with low star formation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m51 ] ) .",
    "a wavelet cross - correlation analysis for m  33 showed that the radio  fir correlation holds at all scales down to 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "the correlation in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) breaks down below scales of about 50  pc @xcite , probably due to the diffusion of cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "ordered ( regular and/or anisotropic ) field traced by polarized synchrotron emission form spiral patterns in almost every galaxy @xcite , even in ring galaxies @xcite , in flocculent galaxies without massive spiral arms @xcite and in the central regions of galaxies and in circum - nuclear gas rings of barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "ordered fields are generally strongest ( 1015  @xmath0 g ) in the regions _ between _  the optical spiral arms and oriented parallel to the adjacent spiral arms , in some galaxies forming _ magnetic arms _ , like in ngc  6946 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m51 ] right ) , with exceptionally high degrees of polarization ( up to 50% ) .",
    "these are probably generated by a large - scale dynamo ( see below ) . in galaxies with strong density waves like m  51 @xcite",
    "enhanced ordered ( anisotropic ) fields occur at the inner edges of the inner optical arms and in the interarm regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m51 ] left ) .    the observed _ spiral magnetic patterns _  with significant pitch angles ( in the range @xmath23 ) indicate a general decoupling between magnetic fields and the gas flow , as predicted by mean - field dynamo action .",
    "there is no other model to explain the magnetic spiral patterns in many types of galaxies .",
    "the typical degree of radio polarization within the spiral arms is only a few % ; hence the field in the spiral arms must be mostly tangled or randomly oriented within the telescope beam , the width of which corresponds to a few 100  pc .",
    "turbulent fields in spiral arms are probably generated by turbulent gas motions related to star formation activity or by a small - scale dynamo @xcite .    in galaxies with massive _ bars _",
    "the field lines follow the gas flow ( fig .  [",
    "fig : n1097 ] left ) .",
    "as the gas rotates faster than the bar pattern of a galaxy , a shock occurs in the cold gas that has a small sound speed , while the flow of warm , diffuse gas is only slightly compressed but sheared .",
    "the ordered field is also hardly compressed .",
    "it is probably coupled to the diffuse gas and strong enough to affect its flow @xcite .",
    "the polarization pattern in barred galaxies can be used as a tracer of shearing gas flows in the sky plane and hence complements spectroscopic measurements of radial velocities .",
    "the _ central regions _  of barred galaxies are often sites of ongoing intense star formation and strong magnetic fields that can affect the gas flow .",
    "ngc  1097 hosts a bright ring with about 1.5  kiloparsec diameter and an active nucleus in its center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n1097 ] right ) .",
    "the ordered field in the ring has a spiral pattern and extends towards the nucleus .",
    "the orientation of the innermost spiral field agrees with that of the spiral dust filaments visible on optical images .",
    "magnetic stress in the circumnuclear ring due to the strong total magnetic field ( about 50  @xmath0 g ) can drive gas inflow @xcite at a rate of several m@xmath24/yr , which is sufficient to fuel the activity of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "_ interaction _  with a dense intergalactic medium also imprints unique signatures onto magnetic fields and thus the radio emission .",
    "the virgo cluster is a location of especially strong interaction effects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n5775 ] left ) , and almost all cluster galaxies observed so far show asymmetries of their polarized emission because the outer magnetic fields were compressed by ram pressure or shearing gas flows @xcite .",
    "ordered fields are an excellent tracer of past interactions between galaxies or with the intergalactic medium , or sweeping - up of the intracluster field @xcite .",
    "_ flocculent _  galaxies have disks but no prominent spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , spiral magnetic patterns exist in all flocculent galaxies observed so far , indicative that the mean - field dynamo works independently of density waves .",
    "ordered magnetic fields with strengths similar to those in grand - design spiral galaxies have been detected in the flocculent galaxies m  33 @xcite , ngc  3521 and ngc  5055 @xcite , and in ngc  4414 @xcite .",
    "the mean degree of polarization ( corrected for the differences in spatial resolution ) is similar between grand - design and flocculent galaxies @xcite .",
    "radio continuum maps of _ irregular _ , slowly rotating galaxies may reveal strong total equipartition magnetic fields , e.g. in the magellanic - type galaxy ngc  4449 where a fraction of the field is ordered with about 7  @xmath0 g strength and a spiral pattern @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation shows that this ordered field is mostly regular and the mean - field dynamo is operating in this galaxy .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies with almost chaotic rotation do not have any regular fields and only spots of faint polarized emission @xcite .",
    "the turbulent field strengths in starburst dwarfs are comparable to those in large spiral galaxies , e.g. in ngc  1569 @xcite , probably driven by a small - scale dynamo .",
    "nearby galaxies seen _ edge - on _  generally show a disk - parallel field near the disk plane @xcite . as a result",
    ", polarized emission can also be detected from distant , unresolved galaxies if the inclination is larger than about @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this opens a new method to search for ordered fields in distant galaxies .",
    "high - sensitivity radio polarization observations of edge - on galaxies like ngc  253 @xcite , ngc  891 @xcite and ngc  5775 ( fig .",

    "the stronger magnetic field in the central regions leads to larger synchrotron loss , leading to the `` dumbbell '' shape of many radio halos , e.g. in ngc  253 @xcite , which is in contrast to its almost spherical x - ray halo @xcite . from the radio scale heights at several frequencies and the corresponding electron lifetimes ( due to synchrotron , ic and adiabatic losses ) a transport speed of about 300  km /",
    "s was measured for the halo of ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "similar radio scale heights of about 2  kpc of most edge - on galaxies observed so far , in spite of the different field strengths , indicates that the outflow speed increases with the average field strength and the star - formation rate @xcite .",

    "these observations support the idea of a strong galactic outflow that is driven by regions of star formation in the inner disk .    _",
    "early - type galaxies _  ( sa , s0 ) and elliptical galaxies without an active nucleus have very little star formation and hence do not produce many cosmic rays emitting synchrotron emission .",
    "the only deep observation of a sa galaxy , m  104 with a prominent dust ring , revealed weak , ordered magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "large - scale regular magnetic fields may exist in differentially rotating galaxies even without any star formation because turbulence can be generated by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",

    "other candidates for a dominating axisymmetric disk field ( dynamo mode @xmath26 ) are the nearby spiral ic  342 @xcite and the irregular large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite .",
    "dominating bisymmetric spiral fields ( dynamo mode @xmath27 ) are rare , with m  81 as the only known case @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation in the magnetic arms of ngc  6946 ( fig .",

    "the spiral pattern of magnetic fields can not be solely the result of mean - field dynamo action .",
    "if the beautiful spiral pattern of m  51 seen in radio polarization @xcite were only due to a regular field , its line - of sight component should generate a conspicuous large - scale pattern in faraday rotation , which is not observed .",
    "this means that a large amount of the ordered field is _ anisotropic _  and probably generated by compression and shear of the non - axisymmetric gas flows in the density - wave potential .",
    "the anisotropic field is strongest at the positions of the prominent dust lanes on the inner edge of the inner gas spiral arms , due to compression of turbulent fields in the density - wave shock . a weak regular field ( dynamo modes @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) also exists in the disk of m  51 @xcite .",
    "in many other observed galaxy disks no clear patterns of faraday rotation were found . either several dynamo modes are superimposed and can not be distinguished with the limited sensitivity and resolution of present - day telescopes , or the timescale for the generation of large - scale modes is longer than the galaxy s lifetime @xcite .    while the azimuthal symmetry of the magnetic field is known for many galaxies , the vertical symmetry ( even or odd )",
