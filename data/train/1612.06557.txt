    "in @xmath1-dimensional contact topology there is a fundamental dichotomy between tight and overtwisted contact structures pioneered by d.  bennequin @xcite and developed further by y.  eliashberg @xcite .",
    "usually , the attention is restricted to tight contact structures .",
    "these contact structures are characterized by the absence of so - called overtwisted discs .",
    "this is because a theorem of y.  eliashberg shows that the classification of contact structures on a fixed closed @xmath1-manifold up to diffeomorphism which contain an overtwisted disc up to isotopy coincides with the classification of plane fields up to homotopy .",
    "what is important in eliashberg s result is that one needs to fix and control an overtwisted disc .",
    "in particular , if one considers the isotopy problem for legendrian or transverse links , eliashberg s theorem can be applied effectively when the complement of the links is overtwisted .",
    "this is not always the case .",
    "as k.  dymara noted in @xcite it may happen that a legendrian or transverse knot has a tight complement .",
    "in other words it intersects all overtwisted discs .",
    "a knot with this property is called non - loose .",
    "also , it may happen that two legendrian knots have the same classical invariants ( the thurston - bennequin invariant and the rotation number ) , each knot has an overtwisted complement but the complement of the union of the two knots is tight . in these situations",
    "one can not apply eliashberg s theorem directly to construct for example legendrian isotopies between two non - loose legendrian knots with the same classical invariants .    in her preprint",
    "@xcite k.  dymara gives several examples of such non - loose legendrian knots in @xmath0 and j.  etnyre constructed more examples in @xcite .",
    "he also found examples of pairs non - loose legendrian knots whose complements are not diffeomorphic .",
    "non - loose legendrian knots are interesting because one can obtain interesting tight contact structures from surgeries on non - loose legendrian knots .",
    "furthermore , as shown in this paper , non - loose unknots can be used to obtain non - trivial information about overtwisted contact structures and not only about additional structures like for example legendrian knots .    a coarse classification ( i.e. up to diffeomorphism ) of non - loose unknots in @xmath0 is due to y.  eliashberg and m.  fraser in @xcite and independently to j.  etnyre ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that on @xmath0 there is a unique contact structure which admits a non - loose unknot , we denote it by @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , it turns out that a non - loose unknot has positive thurston - bennequin invariant .",
    "a coarse classification of certain rationally null - homologous knots in lens spaces was obtained by h.  geiges and s.  onaran @xcite .",
    "one main result of this paper is the classification of non - loose legendrian unknots in @xmath0 up to legendrian isotopy .",
    "let @xmath3 be two non - loose legendrian unknots with @xmath4",
    ". then @xmath5 and @xmath6 are isotopic . when @xmath5 is oriented , then there is no legendrian isotopy which reverses the orientation of @xmath5 .    the first part of this statement follows from theorem  [ t : non or isotopy ] while the second part is the content of theorem  [ t : different or , not isotopic ] . the argument for the first part relies on eliashberg s classification theorem and a study of the characteristic foliation on a spheres containing the non - loose unknot as well as deformations of the sphere which result in overtwisted discs .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : non or isotopy ] uses a classic argument from differential topology",
    ".    we will also classify non - loose unknots with @xmath7 up to isotopy .",
    "then @xmath8 has to be positive and @xmath9 and @xmath5 is isotopic to exactly one of two standard unknots with the same classical invariants .",
    "non - loose unknots with thurston - bennequin invariant one are called minimal .",
    "an important problem concerning the classification of non - loose unknots in @xmath0 that is left open in this article is the following problem .",
    "let @xmath5 be a minimal non - loose oriented unknot in @xmath0 with @xmath10 .",
    "decide effectively whether another minimal non - loose oriented unknot @xmath0 , which could be given in terms of a front projection for example , is isotopic to @xmath5 or @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath5 with its orientation reversed ) .",
    "more problems can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "etnyre s article also contains proofs of most of the known results on non - loose knots . in @xcite k.  baker and s.",
    "onaran propose to quantify the degree of non - looseness of legendrian / transverse knots and suggest a number of problems related to their invariants .",
    "another reference is @xcite where the authors give an example of a pair of non - loose transverse knots with the same classical invariants which are not isotopic .",
    "we give two applications of the classification of non - loose legendrian unknots up to isotopy : first , we prove that there is a pair of boundaries of overtwisted discs in @xmath12 which are not legendrian isotopic to each other .",
    "more precisely , it is not always possible to find a contact isotopy in a contact manifold which moves an overtwisted ball into another such ball .",
    "the other application is the description of the contact mapping class group @xmath13 of contact structures on @xmath0 which preserve the orientation of the contact structure .",
    "the claim in the following theorem is attributed to y.  chekanov in @xcite without any indication of proof .",
    "let @xmath14 be an overtwisted contact structure on @xmath0 and denote by @xmath15 the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 which preserve @xmath14 and an orientation of this plane field",
    ". then @xmath16    the additional @xmath17-summand in the case @xmath18 is determined by considering the action of contactomorphisms on isotopy classes of oriented minimal non - loose legendrian unknots . in @xcite k.",
    "dymara introduced an invariant which detects the other @xmath17-factor for all overtwisted contact structures on @xmath0 .",
    "finally , recall that the group of diffeomorphisms preserving the oriented tight contact structure on @xmath0 is connected according to @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ t : chekanov ] can hopefully be applied to obtain the classification of non - loose links in overtwisted contact structures once the classification up to contact diffeomorphism is known .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ s : prelim ] contains the relevant definitions and examples of non - loose knots . in section  [ s : class ]",
    "we first review the coarse classification using the approach taken in @xcite : the normal form for the characteristic foliation on a disc bounding a non - loose unknot is used heavily in the next sections .",
    "after the construction of examples of contact diffeomorphisms preserving a particular non - loose unknot we prove that every non - loose unknot is isotopic to a standard example @xmath19 .",
    "then we show that @xmath5 and @xmath11 are not isotopic as oriented knots .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : appl ] we discuss the connected components of the group of orientation preserving contact diffeomorphisms on @xmath0 for overtwisted contact structures .",
