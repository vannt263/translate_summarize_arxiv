    "the @xmath3o@xmath0 perovskite oxides constitute an important family of materials that display interesting physical properties ( ferroelectricity , ferroelasticity , superconductivity , magnetism ) and are widely used in technological applications .",
    "barium thorate batho@xmath0 is one of the members of this family .",
    "high thermal stability of barium thorate ( its melting point is above 2300@xmath4c ) and relatively low work function of thorium enable to use batho@xmath0 for thermionic cathodes of high - intensity discharge lamps ( see , for example , patents  @xcite ) .",
    "barium thorate ceramics doped with neodymium  @xcite and yttrium  @xcite are solid electrolytes , which have the highest proton conductivity at temperatures above 900@xmath4c among solid electrolytes . since barium thorate is produced as the fission product in nuclear reactors ( especially in uranium ",
    "thorium reactors ) , the knowledge of its properties is also important for predicting the reliability of nuclear fuel elements",
    ".    insufficient knowledge of the properties of batho@xmath0 becomes evident from the fact that even its crystal structure is not well established . in the very first work ,  @xcite the structure of barium thorate",
    "was identified as a simple perovskite structure with the lattice parameter of @xmath5   .",
    "a more detailed study  @xcite found the superstructure reflections on the diffraction patterns , but because of the lack of splitting of the strong peaks , the structure was considered as a pseudocubic one with a doubled lattice parameter .",
    "finally , after the splitting of the main reflections was observed ,  @xcite the structure of batho@xmath0 was identified as orthorhombic , but neither the space group nor the atomic coordinates were determined .",
    "thermodynamic properties of barium thorate ( the gibbs energy of formation ) were determined in refs .  . in ref .",
    ", the electronic structure , optical and elastic properties of batho@xmath0 were calculated from first principles using the fp - lapw approach , but for some reason the calculations were limited to the cubic five - atom unit cell , whereas x - ray studies clearly indicate the lower symmetry . according to these calculations ,",
    "the cubic barium thorate is a direct - gap insulator with the band gap of @xmath6  ev .",
    "this result , however , contradicts the density - of - states calculations presented in ref .  , according to which the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands is 3.33  ev , and the calculations of the @xmath7 optical spectra in which the absorption starts at an energy below 5  ev .",
    "the knowledge of the true crystal structure of batho@xmath0 is crucial for correct prediction of its properties . in this work ,",
    "we use the first - principles calculations to determine the equilibrium structure of barium thorate , calculate some of its properties , and discuss the possibility of the structural phase transitions in it .",
    "to predict the properties of batho@xmath0 , we must first determine its ground - state structure which has the lowest energy at @xmath8 .",
    "for this purpose , we must first calculate the phonon spectrum of its parent @xmath9 phase and then , by adding the distortions corresponding to unstable modes in the phonon spectrum to the structure , seek for a minimum - energy structure in which the energy of all optical phonons at all points of the brillouin zone are positive and the structure is mechanically stable ( the stability criterion is the positive values of the determinant and all leading principal minors of the 6@xmath106 matrix of elastic moduli in the voigt notation ) .",
    "@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      at 300  k. ]    for identification of the @xmath1 phase of batho@xmath0 it is convenient to use the raman spectroscopy .",
    "the calculated frequencies of the raman - active modes in this phase are given in table  [ table4 ] , and the theoretical raman spectrum calculated for a polycrystalline sample at 300  k using the formulas from ref .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     in the @xmath1 phase of barium thorate ( solid line ) with the experimental data  @xcite ( points ) . ]",
    "the energies of different phases obtained in this work ( table  [ table2 ] ) enable to make some remarks on the possible phase transitions in barium thorate .",
    "the @xmath11 phase closest in energy to the @xmath1 ground - state structure has the energy only by 43.4  mev higher than the ground - state energy .",
    "this means that a second - order phase transition @xmath12 can occur in batho@xmath0 at a temperature slightly above 300  k. in the experimental study of the heat capacity ,  @xcite no anomalies were detected in the temperature range 320820  k , but the peculiarity of the results of ref .",
    "is that the measured values of the specific heat are much higher than our calculated ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and , more significantly , they even exceed the theoretical limit of 3@xmath13 per atom in the unit cell ( the dulong  petit law ) .",
    "this may indicate that the investigated sample was likely not pure . thus forming a mixture of tho@xmath14 + baco@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the annealing temperature before the specific heat measurements in ref .",
    "( 550@xmath4c ) was sufficient to remove moisture , but was not high enough to decompose baco@xmath0 .",
    "after the interaction with co@xmath14 , the number of atoms in a mole of the substance increases , and this results in an increase of the heat capacity . ]",
    "we believe that the predicted phase transition was hidden by this fact . in this regard",
    ", we note that the features in the dielectric properties of batho@xmath0 at about 260@xmath4c , which were observed in ref .   and interpreted as an evidence for the ferroelectric phase transition , can actually be associated with the @xmath12 phase transition under discussion .    to resolve the contradictions mentioned in the introduction on the energy band gap @xmath15 in cubic batho@xmath0",
    ", we performed our own calculations of @xmath15 in both the lda approximation used in this work and in the @xmath2 approximation  @xcite which takes into account the many - body effects and enables to obtain the energy band gap in much better agreement with the experiment .",
    "@xcite according to our data , in the lda approximation @xmath16  ev in the @xmath9 phase ; in the orthorhombic @xmath1 phase the band gap increases to 3.947  ev . as",
    "the dft calculations always underestimate the energy band gap , more realistic @xmath15 values can be obtained in the @xmath2 approximation .",
    "these calculations gave the energy band gap @xmath17  ev for the cubic phase .",
    "this value is intermediate between the two values , 5.7  ev and 3.33  ev , reported for this phase in ref .  .",
    "in both cubic and orthorhombic phases , the extrema of the valence and conduction bands are located at the @xmath18 point of the brillouin zone ( the optical transitions are direct ) .",
    "the calculations presented in this work were performed on the laboratory computer cluster ( 16  cores ) .",
    "first - principles calculations of the phonon spectra and structure of cubic batho@xmath0 and its distorted phases have shown that the ground - state structure of barium thorate is @xmath1 .",
    "the static and optical dielectric constants , elastic moduli , heat capacity , raman spectra , and the energy band gap in the lda and @xmath2 approximations have been calculated for this structure .",
    "it has been shown that the structural phase transition @xmath12 can occur in batho@xmath0 at a temperature slightly above 300  k.    25ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] ",
