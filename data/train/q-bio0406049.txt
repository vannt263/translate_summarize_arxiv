    "in a previous paper , two of us ( balcan and erzan )  @xcite introduced and numerically simulated a content based network  @xcite , with random binary strings associated with each node . the network arose by postulating a directed edge to exist between the nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , if and only if the string , which can be regarded as a random word associated with the @xmath0th node , occurred at least once in the random word associated with the @xmath1th .",
    "this stochastic network was shown  @xcite to display distinctly different topology than either the classical random networks of erds and renyi  @xcite or the  scale free \" networks of the preferential - attachment universality class , introduced by barabasi and albert  @xcite .",
    "simulations  @xcite revealed that the in- and out - degree distributions , were markedly different , with in - degree distribution being rather localised .",
    "the out - degree distribution displayed a sharp crossover behavior .",
    "for small out - degree @xmath2 , the distribution @xmath3 exhibited a putative scaling behavior over a very narrow region , where the log - log plot could be fitted with a straight line with slope @xmath4 , whereas , for larger @xmath2 , log - periodic oscillations were found , with an envelope which could again be fitted , on a double logarithmic plot , by a linear graph with a slope @xmath5 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "we first extend the model of balcan and erzan  @xcite to a broader class of models in which the random strings are derived from an @xmath6 letter alphabet and where partial matches are allowed .",
    "second , we obtain analytical expressions for the ensemble averaged in- and out - degree distributions and investigate the crossover behavior of the out - degree distribution .",
    "we show that the putative scaling behavior observed in the simulations to coincides with the leading power law behavior obtained from our analytical results .",
    "we describe in detail the finite size corrections to the infinite network limit .",
    "comparison of our analytical predictions with the numerical data  @xcite for the @xmath7 random bit string model with perfect matches shows very good agreement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we reformulate the random string model of  @xcite for an alphabet of @xmath6 letters .",
    "our analytical results depend on the matching probability @xmath8 that a string of length @xmath9 selected randomly from the set of all strings of length @xmath9 is contained at least once in a string of length @xmath10 , @xmath11 , that has been selected randomly from the set of all strings of length @xmath10 . in section",
    "iii we derive an approximate form for this probability that is valid for moderately long strings @xmath12 and that allows for partial matches . using the results of section iii , we obtain in section iv analytical expressions for the in- and out - degree distributions .",
    "we investigate the scaling behavior of the out - degree distribution in these models and compare our results with the numerical data of  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of the possible relevance of our results to genomic networks , in section v.",

    "it follows that @xmath33 @xmath34 unless noted otherwise , we will assume that @xmath14 and @xmath35 are sufficiently large so that fluctuations in the number and length of the strings for different realizations of the random sequence @xmath13 can be neglected when calculating statistical properties of quantities of interest .",
    "we will also discard the cases with @xmath36 and construct the graph from the remaining vertices .",
    "the adjacency matrix is defined by the matching condition @xmath37 by @xmath38 we mean that there exists an integer @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 two vertices are said to be connected if the string @xmath18 appears as a subsequence of @xmath42 , or in other words @xmath42 _ matches _ @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath43 indicates a directed link ( an edge ) from @xmath18 to @xmath42 .",

    "this arbitrariness may be removed by proper normalization and scores obtained via different schemes can be compared in a meaningful way .",
    "the matching probability computed in the present paper could be related to the probability for the highest score ( corresponding to an exact match without gaps ) , holding for the entire length of the shorter sequence .",

    "moreover there is no assumption regarding the number of times the highest score is achieved .",
    "more interestingly , the statistics of multiple high - scoring segments  @xcite could have been related to the out - degree statistics of a given node _ had we taken each high scoring match in the complete random sequence to correspond to a different edge_. as it is , a single edge corresponds to the presence of one or more occurrences of a shorter string , say @xmath18 , inside a longer string @xmath42 .",
