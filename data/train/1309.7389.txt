    "recent observations by large , optical telescopes have detected numerous high - redshift galaxies utilizing the drop - out technique at the lyman - limit wavelength , and these galaxies are called the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are considered to be the main contributor of dust production , because other production mechanisms , such as the stellar wind from agb stars and condensation in molecular clouds , are inefficient @xcite .",
    "the production rate of dust is thus related to the formation rate of massive stars , and also indirectly to the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "dust can also assist star formation through efficient formation of hydrogen molecules on its surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , type - ii sne can destroy dust by sputtering effect @xcite , where the high - temperature gas particles collide with dust and strip off components from dust .",
    "in addition , dust - dust collision in magnetic fields , i.e. , the ` shattering effect ' also destroys dust @xcite .",
    "the destruction efficiencies by these processes sensitively depend on the physical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , e.g. , local temperature , density , and magnetic field strength .",
    "interstellar dust is a key component in understanding the star formation history , physical properties of galaxies , and stellar imf .",
    "nevertheless the dust properties in high - redshift galaxies are still not well understood .    in the examination of dust effects on star formation and extinction of stellar radiation",
    ", the typical dust size is the key factor because it determines the total dust surface area .",
    "the dust size distribution will be determined by the combination of different physical processes such as the formation , sputtering & shattering effect , and it is expected to evolve as a function of time and space .    inside the shock wave from sne , only small dust grains with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the radius of dust ) are captured by the shock and destroyed due to the sputtering process @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the initial dust size is likely to be @xmath8 , and the typical dust size may be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "after the initial production of dust by type - ii sne , very small dust ( @xmath10 ) can be produced by the shattering effect , and the dust size distribution would shift to a steeper power - law index of @xmath11 from the initial slope of @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the number density of dust .",
    "this power - law slope agrees with the observations of local galaxies .",
    "unfortunately it is too difficult to follow the dust formation and destruction processes in galaxies completely even with today s state - of - the - art computational facilities and calculation codes , because it requires the following of multiple massive star formation , shock propagations of type - ii sne , magnetic field and turbulence in ism over a wide spatial range from sub - pc to kpc . due to this difficulty",
    ", previous works have mostly adopted simple models of dust assuming the same properties as the local galaxies or single dust size to reproduce radiation properties of observed high - redshift galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite reproduced the rest - frame uv luminosity functions ( lfs ) of lbgs at @xmath15 by cosmological sph simulations with a simple extinction model that assumes the extinction law of local starburst galaxies @xcite and a constant color excess .",
    "@xcite used a slab dust model with the graphite dust size of @xmath16 , and confirmed that the simulated galaxies at @xmath17 agreed with the observed @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xcite simulated lfs of lyman-@xmath18 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath17 by combining cosmological sph simulations with monte carlo radiative transfer ( rt ) , and showed that the dust attenuation with clumpy distribution was needed to reproduce the observational properties .",
    "@xcite reproduced the radiation properties of laes at @xmath19 using a semi - analytical model and a slab dust model with the milky way ( mw ) dust extinction curve .",
    "@xcite investigated the dust attenuation of lbgs in a semi - analytical model using a simple radiative transfer model .",
    "they assumed the bulge and disk follow the mw and the small magellan could ( smc ) dust model , and showed that brighter lbgs suffered stronger dust attenuation than the fainter ones .",
    "very recently @xcite carried out monte carlo rt calculations for @xmath20 simulated galaxies in cosmological amr simulation , and reproduced the observed uv spectral slope @xmath21 .",
    "they concluded that the dust model of smc was favored for the high - redshift galaxies rather than the mw dust model .",
    "in the present work , we attempt to constrain the typical dust size by comparing the results of rt calculations with observational data . depending on the dust properties ,",

    "our code includes the heating by a uniform uv background @xcite , cooling by hydrogen , helium and metals @xcite , the self - shielding effect of the uv background radiation @xcite , and the `` multicomponent variable velocity ( mvv ) '' wind model @xcite , which is the hybrid of energy - driven and momentum - driven wind models .",
    "in addition , the star formation ( sf ) model in our simulations is based on the h@xmath24 mass in each sph particle , which has many advantages over the previous sf models @xcite .",
    "the calculations are done with total @xmath25 particles for both gas and dark matter , with a box size of comoving @xmath26mpc .",

    "first , we place a uniform grid around each dark matter halo with a size of the virial radius .",
    "the size of each grid cell is the same as the comoving gravitational softening length @xmath32 .",
    "the gas and metal density of each cell are estimated from neighboring sph particles with the kernel function ( i.e. sph smoothing ) .",

    ", we shoot only one ray towards one particular viewing angle from each star particle in order to save computational time , i.e. , not the angular mean flux .",
    "a similar post - processing rt method was also used in @xcite .    from the multi - band observations of local galaxies",
    ", @xcite showed that the dust mass can be estimated from gas mass and metallicity with the constant dust - to - metal mass ratio : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio at solar metallicity , @xmath35 is the metallicity , and @xmath36 is the solar metallicity .",

    "* ) , while some works and our original hydrodynamics simulations assumed the chabrier imf @xcite",
    ". however , since we mainly focus on the color excess , our results are not very sensitive to the imf . on the other hand , rest frame uv flux can change between salpeter and chabrier imf by a factor @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "hence , our analysis of uv lf can shift to the brighter side by @xmath47 mag if we switch to the chabrier imf , but it is still in the error bars of the observations and does not change our main conclusions .",
    "the optical depth is estimated by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the dust absorption coefficient , @xmath7 and @xmath14 are the dust radius and number density , respectively . here",

    "the absorption efficiency is somewhat higher than that of smaller dust at @xmath83 , and then it starts to decrease with increasing wavelength .",

    "the value of @xmath4 for @xmath99 dust is similar to the observation . in addition , despite a similar dust extinction at @xmath62 , halo @xmath103 shows a much smaller @xmath4 than halo @xmath102 , because the sed simply decreases while keeping its shape .",
    "the seds can vary due to different viewing angles and inhomogeneous distributions of dust and stars .",
    "however , the qualitative trends of dust extinction discussed above do not change .    to investigate the source of variation in @xmath4 further , we present the pdf of optical depth at @xmath62 from each star particle to the grid boundary for the same halos in figure  [ fig : stau ] . the large dispersion in optical depth for different stellar positions and viewing angles",

    "moreover , the high column densities absorb most of the flux at uv - to - optical bands , whereas the low column densities let the radiation escape without much dust extinction .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the sed without changing its shape very much and with a smaller @xmath4 similar to halo @xmath103 .",
    "we note that previous semi - analytical or simple models in simulations used a constant optical depth for all star particles in a galaxy @xcite .",

    "therefore the rest - frame uv lf is not so sensitive to the dust size .",
    "we also see in figure  [ fig : lf ] that the uv lf converges at the fainter end due to the decreasing dust extinction for fainter galaxies .",
    "this was not the case for the constant extinction model .",
    "we also point out that the dust content increases with galaxy mass , hence the stellar radiation is efficiently absorbed in higher mass galaxies . as a result ,",
    "the dotted line is shifted to the brighter side by a greater amount at the bright - end of the lf from the observed data points .",

    "as we discussed in equation  ( [ eq : dustgas ] ) , we have taken the dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath156 at solar abundance so far , which is similar to the value for milky way and other local galaxies @xcite . however , at higher redshift , a large fraction of dust can be destroyed due to the sputtering process in supernova shock waves @xcite .",
    "in addition , the contribution from agb stars is little at high redshift",
    ". therefore , the value of @xmath37 could be lower at higher redshifts than the local value .",
    "here we examine the effect of varying @xmath37 with a modulation factor @xmath157 defined by @xmath158 as shown in equation  ( [ eq : dustgas ] ) , our fiducial model assumes that the dust - to - gas mass ratio increases with metallicity based on the constant dust - to - metal mass ratio , @xmath159 .",
    "the above @xmath157 controls the dust - to - metal mass ratio , for example , @xmath160 means the dust - to - metal ratio is reduced to 0.25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ebv_dfactor](a ) shows the uv lfs computed with different @xmath157 .",
    "the lf shifts to the brighter side slightly with decreasing @xmath157 due to the lower amount of dust .",
    "however , the lfs with @xmath161 are mostly within the error bars of the observed data , and the comparison of lfs can not constrain the values of @xmath157 .",
    "our comparison only suggests @xmath162 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath114 depends on @xmath157 sensitively , and linearly increases with it as shown in figure  [ fig : ebv_dfactor](b ) .",
    "our result suggests that @xmath163 is required , in order to reproduce the observed value of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , even at @xmath23 , we suggest that the relation of dust - to - metal mass ratio as a function of metallicity is close to the local relation . recent observation using grb aftergrows also suggested higher dust - to - metal mass ratios in high - redshift galaxies @xcite , which is consistent with our simulation results .",
    "so far we have assumed the dust composition of graphite and silicate with a 1:1 mass ratio ( fiducial model ) . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the impact of different mass ratios . as a test",
    ", we use simple models that all dust are either graphite or silicate .",
    "figure  [ fig : ebv_comp](a ) shows that the rest - frame uv lfs with only silicate or graphite dust do not differ so much from the 1:1 mix fiducial model , and they all agree relatively well with the observed data .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath114 is affected by the dust component significantly , as shown in figure  [ fig : ebv_comp](b ) .",
    "the @xmath114 with graphite dust ( green line ) is higher than the fiducial model , while with silicate dust it is very small and almost constant .",
    "one might wonder why the silicate - only model can reproduce the uv lf so well with such little @xmath114 .",
    "silicate dust has small @xmath49 at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_silicate ] shows the absorption efficiency of dust which consists of either graphite or silicate alone .",
    "for example , @xmath16 silicate dust has @xmath164 at @xmath165 , while it is @xmath166 at @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath167 $ ] , where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the optical depth at @xmath2- and @xmath3-band , the @xmath4 becomes very small when @xmath170 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath49 of silicate at @xmath62 is similar to that of graphite , hence it shows similar uv lfs . as a result , while silicate dust can reproduce the observed uv lf with a moderate dust extinction at @xmath62 , it fails to reproduce the observed @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the graphite dust is mainly responsible for causing extinction , and it can increase the extinction up to @xmath171 with @xmath172 by itself .",
    "our result suggests that , in order to reproduce the observed level of @xmath4 , at least more than half of dust should be composed of graphite .",
    "finally we discuss the impact of scattering .",
    "so far we have considered only the dust absorption , however in reality , some fraction of uv continuum photons can be scattered by dust , and then absorbed . in this section , we study the maximum effect of scattering by assuming that all scattered photons are absorbed , or equivalently that they are scattered out of our line - of - sight and no additional scattered photons enter our viewing angle . the fiducial mixed dust model with silicate and graphite is used for the study of scattering in this section .    the blue line in figure  [ fig : ebv_comp](a ) shows the rest - frame uv lf with the maximum scattering effect for @xmath149 dust .",
    "the lf with maximum scattering is much fainter than the observed data due to the strong extinction , and it is clearly inconsistent with reddy s data .    the blue line in figure  [ fig : ebv_comp](b ) shows the @xmath114 as a function of dust size with the maximum scattering effect .",
    "it peaks at @xmath172 similarly to the one without scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ebv ] ) , but the peak value is higher with @xmath171 .",
    "this suggests that it is difficult to reproduce the observed uv lf and @xmath4 simultaneously with the maximum scattering effect .",
    "one possible way to fit the observations even with the maximum scattering effect would be reducing @xmath37 , as it would decrease the dust extinction at @xmath173 and @xmath4 as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebv_dfactor](b ) .     as a function of wavelength .",
    "different colors represent different dust sizes : @xmath174 ( green ) , @xmath99 ( red ) , and @xmath175 ( orange ) , respectively .",
    "solid and dash lines show dust models which consists of either graphite or silicate alone , respectively . ]",
    "in this paper , we investigate the dust properties in the lbgs at @xmath0 by combining cosmological simulations with multi - wavelength rt calculations .",
    "we compute the rt from all star particles in 2800 massive halos at @xmath0 that contain lbgs , and compared the rest - frame uv lf and @xmath39 with observations .",
    "we only examine galaxies brighter than @xmath176 or @xmath177 , corresponding to the detection limits of recent lbgs surveys .",
    "the most significant result is that our simulation can naturally reproduce the observed rest - frame uv lf with a dust model that work on an individual particle level .",
    "earlier works using cosmological simulations have either adopted a constant extinction value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or an ad hoc power - law relation between galaxy metallicity and the extinction with some scatter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our present work is an important step forward from those previous treatments , in the sense that we now compute the extinction of each galaxy based on the dust properties of each gas particle , utilizing the rt technique .",
    "a similar approach using rt was taken by the sunrise code @xcite and the @xmath178 code @xcite .",
    "they computed the seds and surface brightness of galaxies with a specific dust model , e.g. , the milky way @xcite or supernova @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "considering the large uncertainties of dust properties in high - redshift galaxies , we tested many dust models with varying parameters using simple ray - tracing method , and calculated the seds of numerous galaxies .",
    "another point is that the sunrise and @xmath178 take the scattering process into account based on the albedo of dust using random numbers . on the other hand",
    ", we considered only an upper limit case where all scattered photons are absorbed by dust and disappears from the viewing angle (   [ sec : scattering ] ) .",
    "overall , our calculation method is simpler than the sunrise or art@xmath179 methods which allows us to probe a wider range of dust parameters .",
    "we also examined the sensitivity of @xmath4 to the dust properties , namely their composition and grain size . based on the comparison between our simulations and observations",
    ", we suggest that the dust in lbgs at @xmath0 likely have the following properties :    * typical dust size is @xmath180 , which is similar to that originated from type - ii supernova .",
    "* dust - to - metal mass ratio is close to that of local galaxies . *",
    "more than half of dust consists of graphite , rather than silicates .    in the present work",
    ", our fiducial dust model adopts the following assumptions : a spherical shape , the relationship of @xmath181 , and the composition of graphite and silicate with a 1:1 mass - ratio .",
    "our best - fit model is @xmath180 and @xmath182 , which is close to the local value .",
    "however , a different mass ratio of composition and scattering may change the best - fit model to somewhat lower dust - to - metal mass ratios and different dust sizes ( other than @xmath183 ) .",
    "future multi - wavelength observations and theoretical simulations will be able to give us more information to constrain these details further . in the future",
    ", we will extend our work to a wider redshift range , and investigate the redshift evolution of dust properties .",
    "the mixing and distribution of dust in galaxies is still a difficult and unresolved issue in current theoretical models of galaxy formation . in particular , the lack of mixing in sph codes relative to mesh codes has been noted before by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and new sph formulations to remedy this problem have been developed recently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , @xcite compared the gas distribution in galaxies between sph and the moving mesh code , arepo , and showed that the gas distribution in the sph run was more clumpy than in arepo .",
    "such clumpy gas structure may make the dispersion of @xmath4 greater , because some fraction of viewing angles can interact with high - density gas clumps , resulting in strong dust attenuation .",
    "@xcite also showed that , with the newer formulation of sph , the clumpy structure of previous sph simulations disappears due to more efficient mixing of gas . on the other hand",
    ", there are many simulation results from amr codes that show clumpy gas distributions in high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we plan to repeat our calculations with the new version of sph in the near future , and examine how the clumpy gas distribution may have affected our results on the @xmath4 distribution .",
    "future observations will also resolve the gas structure in higher redshift galaxies better , and we will be able to make more robust comparisons and develop a better model of galaxy formation .",
    "we note in passing however , that we are currently limited more by the speed of the rt code , which prohibits us to use large grid sizes for massive halos , even when we have higher hydrodynamic resolution in sph simulations .    any results on dust attenuation would be sensitive to dust distribution , and the details of the feedback prescription",
    "will also be important for dust distribution .",
    "our current work assumed that dust distribution coupled metal , and our simulation used the hybrid multi - component variable velocity ( mvv ) wind model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see section  [ sec : model ] ) to transport metals from type - ii supernovae into intergalactic medium via galactic outflows .",
    "the mvv wind model was more successful in reproducing the observed igm metallicity compared to the earlier constant speed wind model , but there is still room for further improvement in our feedback model , such as the inclusion of early stellar feedback by stellar winds and radiation pressure , which we plan to investigate in the future .",
