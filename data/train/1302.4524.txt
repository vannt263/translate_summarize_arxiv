    "recently we proposed a model for soft interactions at high energies that provides a good description of the lhc data on total , elastic and diffractive cross sections@xcite , as well as inclusive hadron production@xcite .",
    "this model incorporates the main features of theoretical approaches to high energy interactions : viz .",
    "perturbative qcd@xcite ( pqcd ) and n=4 sym@xcite . the resulting features are : + i ) a large value of the pomeron intercept ( @xmath1 ) and diminishing @xmath2 ( pqcd and n=4 sym ) ; + ii ) a large contribution of good - walker@xcite(gw ) mechanism to diffraction production ( n=4 sym ) ; + iii ) significant triple pomeron ( 3ip ) interaction ( matching with pqcd ) .    in table 1",
    "we show our predictions for the different components of single diffraction production . @xmath3",
    "corresponding to the gw mechanism , while @xmath4 corresponds to the contribution of multi - pomeron interactions to diffraction production .",
    "this table demonstrates that most of the diffractive cross section in our model stems from the gw mechanism , this in accordance with the n=4 sym .",
    ".predictions of our model for single diffractive production cross sections at different energies @xmath5 .",
    "[ t ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "c    the mass distribution for single diffractive production has only been measured at low energies , however , we compare with the data obtained at the tevatron@xcite , and found even this data base not adequate to determine the pomeron contribution . even though , one can produce at the tevatron large diffractive masses , up to @xmath6 , we find that the contribution of the secondary reggeons is significant , about 50% given @xmath7 . we conclude that taking @xmath7 is not sufficient to induce a strong enough suppression of the secondary reggeons contribution to single diffraction .",
    "we note that , diffractive @xmath8 produced at the lhc corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we will have to wait for the diffractive mass distribution at the lhc to discuss the pomeron induced diffractive production .",
    "in we plot the cdf data and our estimates .",
    "one can see from this comparison that the data support a scale of hardness for the pomeron @xmath10 .",
    "bearing in mind all uncertainties that stem from the gluon structure function and the contribution of the secondary reggeons , which could change the behavior at large @xmath11 , we consider that our attempt to describe the data is rather successful .",
    "it is important to mention that for this comparison we require more input from our model . to this end , we use the value of the single diffraction slope @xmath12(see ref.@xcite .",
    "this slope has been calculated for the single diffractive gw sector . for the non gw diffractive pomeron sector ,",
    "the slope is the same as @xmath13 . for the description of the cdf data we use the following formula [ meq1 ] & = & \\ { b^gw_sd(b^gw_sdt)^gw_sd q ( , |q^2 ) /i_q ( m_max ) + & + & ( b^ip_sd(b^ip_sdt ) ^ip_sdg ( , |q^2)/i_g(m_max ) }",
    "this paper was triggered by the absence of a theoretical procedure to calculate the single diffractive mass distribution .",
    "such a procedure is an essential ingredient in the forthcoming experimental analysis of the mass distribution in the diffractive channels , foremost the leading single diffraction channel to rectify this deficiency , we have suggested that the pomeron that has been adopted in refs.@xcite , stems from processes with sufficiently large transverse momenta , and can be viewed as a hard probe of the constituents of the hadron .",
    "the simple formula of indicates how we can use the mass distribution of single diffraction production , to measure the quarks and gluons in a hadron .",
    "we trust that these will be helpful in understanding the soon to be available experimental diffractive mass data from the lhc .",
    "we believe that the description of @xmath14 in terms of quarks and gluons , will determine the pomeron scale of hardness , as well as additional information on the gluon densities .",
    "we thank risto orava , martin poghosyan and jean - pierre charles revol for dis cussion on the experimental situation in diffractive production .",
