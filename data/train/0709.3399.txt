    "discrete dynamical systems represented by nonlinear lattices in one , two , and three dimensions constitute a class of models which are of fundamental interest by themselves , and , simultaneously , they find applications of paramount importance in various fields of physics .",
    "one such example is known in nonlinear optics , where the one - dimensional ( 1d ) discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation was predicted by christodoulides and joseph to support fundamental discrete solitons @xcite with an even profile .",
    "such nonlinear structures were later created experimentally in an array of semiconductor waveguides @xcite .",
    "subsequently , stable odd solitons , alias _ twisted localized modes _ , were predicted and studied in detail in the same model @xcite , as well as in an array of photorefractive waveguides with photovoltaic nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "another experimental realization of dynamical lattices in the optical domain is possible in photorefractive crystals , where a quasi - discrete setting can be induced by counterpropagating laser beams illuminating the crystal in the normal polarization , while the probe beam , which can sustain solitary waves , is launched in the extraordinary polarization .",
    "the difference from the array of waveguides fabricated in silica or in a semiconductor material is that the photorefractive nonlinearity is saturable , rather than cubic .",
    "this method of the creation of _ photonic lattices _ was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and results obtained by means of the technique were reviewed in refs .",
    "in particular , both fundamental and twisted solitons in the 1d lattice were reported in ref .",
    "tlmphotorefr , and fundamental solitons ( fss ) in the 2d lattice were created too @xcite , as well as 2d vortex solitons ( vss ) in the same setting @xcite .",
    "recently , the progress in the technology of writing permanent arrays of channels in silica slabs has made it possible to create 2d waveguiding lattices with the cubic nonlinearity , which emulate a bundle of nonlinear optical fibers with linear coupling in the transverse plane silica - bundle .",
    "in particular , spatial lattice solitons of the surface and corner types were reported in this setting @xcite ( surface solitons were reported too in the 2d photonic lattice in a photorefractive crystal @xcite ) .",
    "thus , 1d and 2d discrete dynamical models have a potential for further applications to nonlinear optical media of various types .",
    "another natural realization for the lattice systems is provided by a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in an optical lattice ( ol ) .",
    "if the ol is strong enough , the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe )  for the wave function in the continuum may be approximated by its dnls counterpart @xcite ; the relevance of the discrete model in this setting has also been demonstrated experimentally in 1d by testing its predictions experimentally , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "higher - dimensional ols can be easily created too @xcite .",
    "thus , the relevant dnls equation may be one- , two- , or three - dimensional ; in particular , various species of 3d discrete solitons , including those with intrinsic vorticity , have been predicted in this setting @xcite , and their stability has been systematically analyzed @xcite .",
    "still another implementation of the dnls lattice in the space of any dimension , from one to three , is possible in terms of a crystal of microcavities trapping photons @xcite or polaritons @xcite .",
    "discrete solitons of various kinds have been studied in detail theoretically in 1d , 2d , and 3d versions of the dnls equation , see an earlier review panosreview and the more recent works mentioned above . as mentioned above ,",
    "some of these solitons have been created experimentally in optical media equipped with fabricated or photoinduced lattices .",
    "all these localized states have their counterparts in continuum models with periodic potentials that emulate the lattices . in particular , 2d solitons of both the fundamental and vortex types , which are unstable in uniform continua with the cubic self - focusing nonlinearity can be readily stabilized by the periodic ol potential @xcite ; for the stabilization of fss , a quasi-1d potential is sufficient , instead of its full 2d counterpart @xcite .",
    "vortices are unstable too in the uniform space with the saturable nonlinearity @xcite , in which case they can also be stabilized by the periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these stabilization mechanisms in the continuum was also demonstrated for higher - order vortex solitons , and so - called _ supervortices _ , i.e. , arrays of compact vortices with global vorticity imprinted onto the array , under both cubic and saturable nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that 2d solitons obeying the gpe in the 2d continuum can also be supported by a _ rotating _",
    ". these solitons may be fully localized ( spot - shaped ) solutions to the equation with the self - focusing / attractive cubic nonlinearity , placed at some distance from the rotation pivot and revolving in sync with the holding 2d lattice .",
    "in particular , the soliton can be placed at a local minimum of the rotating potential , while the pivot is set at a local maximum .",
    "these _ co - rotating _",
    "strongly localized solitons are stable provided that the rotation frequency , @xmath4 , does not exceed a critical value , @xmath15 . in the same model , but with a rapidly rotating ol , stable _ ring - shaped _ solitons ( with zero vorticity ) , i.e. , objects localized along the radius but delocalized in the azimuthal direction , have been found too , for @xmath4 exceeding another critical value , @xmath16 .",
    "note that the model does not support any stable pattern in interval @xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "stable ring - shaped states , with both zero and nonzero vorticity , have been found in the model with the repulsive cubic nonlinearity and rotating quasi - one - dimensional ( periodic ) potential , if @xmath4 exceeds a respective critical value . obviously , the latter model does not give rise to any localized state in the absence of the rotation .",
    "a rotating ol can be easily implemented in bec  experiments @xcite ; then , if the ol is strong enough , it is natural to approximate the gpe in the co - rotating reference frame by an appropriate variety of the 2d dnls equation .",
    "in addition to that , such a model may also describe the light propagation in a _ twisted bundle _ of nonlinear optical fibers , linearly coupled in the transverse plane by tunneling of light between the fiber cores .",
    "the objective of the present work is to introduce a model of the rotating discrete lattice , and find stable discrete solitons in it , both fss and vss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the model , taking the underlying gpe in the reference frame co - rotating with the ol , and replacing the continuum equation by its discrete version corresponding to a strong periodic potential .",
    "discrete fss are considered in sec .",
    "we construct the solutions starting from the anti - continuum limit , which corresponds to zero value of the coupling constant accounting for the linear interaction between neighboring sites of the discrete lattice , @xmath19 .",
    "a family of fs solutions is constructed by continuation in @xmath5 ; their stability is examined by computation of eigenfrequencies for infinitesimal perturbations around the soliton , and verified by direct simulations of the evolution of perturbed fss .",
    "it is found that the fs , with its center located at distance @xmath0 from the rotation pivot , is stable within an interval @xmath6 , with @xmath20 decaying as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "section iii also includes a simple analytical approximation , which makes it possible to explain the decrease of @xmath20 with the growth of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider localized vortices ( vss ) , whose center coincides with the rotation pivot . for the vs with vorticity @xmath2 ,",
    "the stability region is found to be @xmath21 , provided that the rotation frequency , @xmath4 , is smaller than a critical value , @xmath22 ( the stability interval shrinks to nil at @xmath23 ) .",
    "vortices with @xmath10 are considered too .",
    "while in the ordinary ( nonrotating ) dnls model , with @xmath11 , all vss of the latter type are unstable higher - order - vortex , we demonstrate that the rotation opens a _ stability window _ for them , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 growing as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "direct numerical simulations are also used to illustrate the dynamical evolution of fss and vss when they are unstable .",
    "results obtained in this work and related open problems are summarized in sec .",
    "the starting point is the normalized 2d gpe ,  which includes the potential in the form of an ol rotating at angular velocity @xmath4 , and thus stirring a  pancake \"- shaped ( quasi - flat ) bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped in a narrow gap between two strongly repelling optical sheets . unlike the analysis performed in refs . @xcite and barcelona , where simulations were run in the laboratory reference frame , here we write the gpe in the reference frame co - rotating with the lattice",
    ", hence the potential does not contain explicit time dependence : @xmath24 \\psi + \\sigma |\\psi    @xmath25 is the operator of the @xmath26-component of the orbital momentum ( @xmath27 is the polar angle ) , and @xmath28 determines the sign of the interaction , attractive ( @xmath29 ) or repulsive ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 determine a possible shift of the lattice with respect to the rotation pivot .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) does not contain any additional trapping potential , as we are interested in solutions localized under the action of the ol .",
    "it is more convenient to shift the origin of the cartesian coordinates to a lattice node , thus replacing eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) by the translated form : @xmath33 \\psi -\\epsilon \\left [ \\cos \\left ( kx\\right ) + \\cos ( ky)\\right ] \\psi + \\sigma |\\psi |^{2}\\psi .",
    "\\label{shifted}\\]]as shown in a general form in ref .",
    "@xcite , a discrete model , which corresponds to the limit of a very deep ol , can be derived from the underlying gpe in the _ tight - binding approximation_. eventually , it amounts to a straightforward discretization of the gpe .",
    "thus , the discrete counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ shifted ] ) is @xmath34 \\right\\ } + \\sigma |\\psi _ { m , n}|^{2}\\psi _ { m , n}~ , \\label{discrete}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath35 are discrete coordinates , and @xmath36 is the corresponding coupling constant , which accounts for the linear tunneling of atoms between bec  droplets trapped in deep nodes of the lattice . as mentioned above , eq .",

    "\\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\]]in addition to @xmath5 , the discrete model contains three irreducible parameters : @xmath4 , which takes values @xmath40 , and the coordinates of the pivot displacement , @xmath41 , which take values @xmath42 , plus the sign parameter , @xmath43 . as in the usual 2d dnls equation",

    ", @xmath44 , therefore we fix @xmath45 ( self - attraction ) .    our first objective is to find stationary localized solutions to eq .",

    ", we substitute the standing wave ansatz , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the normalized chemical potential , in terms of the underlying bec model ; then , the stationary lattice field @xmath48 obeys the equation @xmath49 + |\\phi _ { m , n}|^{2}\\phi _ { m , n}~.",
    "\\label{phi}\\end{aligned}\\]]note that solutions for @xmath48 are complex , unless @xmath11 . the second objective will be to examine the stability of the discrete solitons , assuming small perturbations in the form of @xmath50 , the onset of instability indicated by the emergence of @xmath51 .",
    "the evolution of unstable solitons will be examined by means of direct simulations of eq .",

    "the rotation makes the discrete lattice inhomogeneous , hence properties of solitons strongly depend of the location of their centers . without the rotation , eq .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) amounts to the ordinary 2d dnls  equation , in which various species of discrete solitons and their stability have been studied in detail .",
    "in particular , fss , which are represented by real solutions , are stable at @xmath54 panosreview .",
    "the onset of their instability is accounted for by a pair of eigenfrequencies of small perturbations with finite imaginary and zero real parts , i.e. , the instability leads to the exponential growth of perturbations . accordingly ,",
    "numerical simulations of the instability development demonstrate spontaneous transformation of unstable fss into lattice breathers @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we first report numerical results obtained for the stability of fss in the model with @xmath14 , and then present an analytical estimate that may explain numerical findings .      our analysis aimed to determine the stability border for the fss , @xmath20 , for each set of values of the discrete coordinates of the soliton s center , @xmath55 .",
    "here we present results for angular velocity @xmath56 and zero pivot displacement , @xmath57 [ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rotation pivot was fixed at a local maximum of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ shifted ] ) , which corresponds to setting @xmath58 in eqs .",
    "( [ discrete ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , and the center of the soliton trapped in the lattice was placed at a local minimum closest to the pivot , which would mean @xmath59 .",
    "this choice makes it possible to explore the existence and stability of fss in a clear form , while larger values of @xmath4 give rise to a resonance with linear lattice modes , leading to wannier - stark ladders and hybrid solitons hybrid and making the continuation in @xmath5 and identification of @xmath20 difficult .",
    "we carried out the calculations on the lattice of size @xmath60 , since already for this case , the lattice was for all the considered cases sufficiently wider than the very localized fs structures of interest . to avoid effects of the boundaries ,",
    "the range of the soliton - center s coordinates was restricted to @xmath61 .",
    "the fs solutions were looked for starting at point @xmath19 , i.e. , at the so - called anti - continuum limit @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the fs is seeded by using a nonzero value of the field at a single point , the center of the fs , @xmath62 ; obviously , this expression satisfies eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) with @xmath63 and @xmath19 . after the branch of the fs solutions had been found by the continuation in @xmath5",
    ", its stability was quantified through the computation of eigenfrequencies of small perturbations , using the equation linearized about the fs .",
    "figure [ fig : stabfsol ] displays a typical example of the thus found dependence of eigenfrequencies @xmath64 of small perturbations on the lattice coupling constant . as said above , the instability corresponds to @xmath51 , for the fs with its center set at point ( @xmath65 ) ; for comparison , the dependence of the instability growth rate , i.e. , @xmath66 , on @xmath5 is also shown for the fs in the usual dnls model ( @xmath11 ) in the top panel of the figure .",
    "it is seen that the instability sets in at @xmath67 , which is smaller than the critical value in the ordinary model , @xmath68 .",
    "typical examples of stable and unstable fss belonging to the family presented in fig .",

    "transform it into a persistent breather , but without the vortical structure .",
    "in fact , a similar qualitative conclusion was made in the ordinary model , with @xmath11 , where all vss with @xmath10 are unstable @xcite .    , but for vortex solitons with @xmath10 . ]",
    "along with complex solutions for localized vortices with @xmath70 , the ordinary 2d dnls equation , with @xmath11 , gives rise to real solutions in the form of quadrupoles and octupoles , that resemble higher - order vortices , but carry no topological charge @xcite .",
    "in particular , quadrupoles , which include four lattice sites with alternating phases , have their stability region , @xmath71 , in the model with @xmath11 ; the same is true for octupoles , which are based on eight sites with alternating phases . in the anti - continuum limit , the quadrupole and octupole solutions are seeded , respectively , by the following configurations : , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , all other sites having @xmath74 .",
    "note that the latter configuration is tantamount to the necklace soliton pattern , that was recently observed in a photorefractive crystal with a photoinduced lattice @xcite .",
    "we have constructed families of quadrupole and octupole soliton solutions in the present model with @xmath75 , proceeding from the anti - continuum patterns to finite @xmath5 .",
    "when doing so , the rotation pivot in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) was set at the center of the respective pattern , i.e. , we set @xmath76 and @xmath58 , for the quadrupole and octupole solutions respectively .",
    "it was found that the critical values of the coupling constant , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which border the stability regions for both these families , very weakly depend on @xmath4 , unlike the situation for the vss with @xmath10 , cf .",
    "[ diagram2 ] , but quite similar to what was found above for the localized vortices with @xmath2 , see the right stability border in fig .",
    "the objective of the present work was to introduce a discrete version of the 2d model combining the self - attractive cubic nonlinearity and rotating square - lattice potential .",
    "the discrete model can be implemented in bec stirred by a rotating strong optical lattice , or , in principle , also in a twisted bundle of nonlinear optical fibers .",
    "localized solutions of two types were considered : off - axis fss ( fundamental solitons ) , with the center placed at distance @xmath0 from the rotation pivot , and on - axis vss ( vortex solitons ) , with vorticity @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for the fss , the stability interval was found in the form of @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the coupling constant of the discrete lattice , and @xmath7 a monotonically decreasing function , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ccr ] .",
    "a qualitative explanation to this result was proposed , based on the analysis of the balance between the lattice - pinning and centrifugal forces .",

    "[ diagram1 ] , with the conclusion that the stability is only possible for @xmath79 . a key feature , which makes the situation different from earlier stability analyses of such structures in the standard 2d dnls model , is a higher - order eigenfrequency , shifted towards instability for sufficiently weak lattice coupling , in the presence of rotation . on the other hand , vss with @xmath10 , which are always unstable in the model with @xmath80 ,",
    "are stabilized by the rotation in region @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",
    "diagram2 . for the vortices with @xmath10",
    ", the reverse effect happens in comparison with @xmath2 , namely an unstable ( at @xmath11 ) eigenfrequency is tipped by the rotation in the opposite direction ; i.e. , for @xmath2 a real eigenfrequency becomes imaginary in the presence of @xmath81 , while the reverse is true for @xmath10 .",
    "quadrupole and octupole solitons , with the center coinciding with the pivotal point , were briefly considered too , with a conclusion that their stability regions are almost the same as in the ordinary model ( with @xmath11 ) .",
    "an estimate for relevant values of @xmath4 in physical units was given for both physical realizations of the model , i.e. , the rotation frequency of the optical lattice stirring the self - attractive bec , and the pitch of the twisted bundle of optical fibers .",
    "the analysis initiated in this work can be developed in several directions .",
    "in particular , results obtained in the continuum model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that , at sufficiently large @xmath4 , the fully localized fss , with the center shifted off the axis ( i.e. , continuum counterparts of the discrete fss considered in the present work ) , are unstable ( or do not exist ) , while stable ring - shaped solitons may appear instead , with the center of the ring coinciding with the pivot .",
    "in fact , the shape of these zero - vorticity rings may be similar to that of the vortices considered above .",
    "another interesting direction would be to apply techniques elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite to this considerably more difficult setting",
    ". it would be especially relevant to repeat the calculation of the eigenfrequencies for the vortices with @xmath2 and @xmath10 by means of those methods in the presence of rotation , and quantify the impact of @xmath4 on the eigenvalues , to rigorously investigate some effects which were outlined above in a qualitative form .",
    "another possibility is to consider a discrete limit of the model with the rotating quasi-1d potential , such as the one with the repulsive cubic nonlinearity , which was introduced in ref . @xcite .",
    "studies along these directions are currently underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
