    "maldacena s duality @xcite provides a remarkable relation between string theory and supersymmetric and conformal quantum field theory . recently",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to extend this duality and find new correspondences between string theories and non conformal and less supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "these attempts have been developed in several directions , one of which is the study of fractional d - branes @xcite on conifold @xcite and orbifold singularities @xcite . in this case",
    "the dual gauge theory corresponding to a stack of m such fractional branes is non conformal and supersymmetry is partially broken with respect to the original case considered by maldacena .",
    "it is well known that the fractional d@xmath0-branes can be viewed as ordinary d(@xmath3)-branes wrapped on an integer basis of vanishing two - cycles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to test this correspondence by explicit calculations of string scattering amplitudes .",
    "in particular we focus on the fractional d@xmath0-branes in type iia string theory compactified on @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is generated by the parity operator on the four compact spatial coordinates .",
    "more specifically , we want to check that the boundary action for fractional d@xmath0-branes , obtained geometrically from the one of d(@xmath3 ) branes suitably wrapped , is in agreement with the cft predictions . to do this we first determine the supergravity fields which couple to the fractional d - brane by means of the boundary state formalism ( for a review see @xcite )",
    "this simply amounts to obtain the terms of the world - volume action of the fractional d - brane which are linear in the bulk fields .",
    "then , we go on and compute the quadratic terms of the fractional branes world - volume action using the same methods that have been discussed for ordinary d - branes in @xcite .",
    "+ these calculations confirm that the world - volume action obtained geometrically is consistent with the explicit conformal calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the geometric approach to fractional d - branes and derive accordingly their world - volume action ; in section 3 we calculate the linear and quadratic scattering amplitudes between the massless fields that couple to fractional d - branes .",
    "the three appendices are devoted respectively to fix our notation , determine the normalization for the boundary state and to list the vertices used in various calculations .",
    "the action for type iia supergravity in ten dimensions can be written ( in the string frame ) as : @xmath6              { \\nonumber \\\\ } & &              + \\frac{1}{2}\\big [ ~ { { \\rm f}_{(2 ) } } \\wedge ~ { ^{*_{10}}}{{\\rm f}_{(2 ) } } ~              + ~ { { \\rm \\widetilde{f}}_{(4 ) } } \\wedge ~ { ^{*_{10}}}{{\\rm \\widetilde{f}}_{(4 ) } } ~              -{{\\rm b}_{(2)}}\\wedge{{\\rm f}_{(4)}}\\wedge{{\\rm f}_{(4)}}~          \\big ]      \\bigg\\ } \\label{bulk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are respectively the field strengths corresponding to the ns - ns 2-form potential , to the 1-form and 3-form potentials of the r - r sector ; moreover : @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the string coupling constant",
    ".    the usual bps d@xmath0-branes with @xmath0 even are solutions of the classical field equations that follow from the action ( [ bulk ] ) , which are charged under the r - r @xmath11-form potentials and preserve sixteen supercharges . on the other hand ,",

    "let us now consider type iia supergravity compactified on the orbifold @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reflection parity that changes the sign to the four coordinates of the torus @xmath17 , which we take to be @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the bulk action for this theory is still given by ( [ bulk ] ) suitably compactified @xcite , but with @xmath22 replaced by @xmath23 .",
    "+ the orbifold ( [ bg ] ) is a singular limit of a smooth k3 surface . in this case , besides the usual d@xmath0-branes ( bulk branes ) which can freely move in the compact directions , there are _ fractional _ d@xmath0-branes @xcite which are instead constrained to stay at one of the orbifold fixed points . the fractional d@xmath0-branes can be viewed as ordinary d(@xmath3)-branes wrapped on an integer basis of cycles @xmath24 , with a non trivial @xmath25-flux , in the collapsing limit in which these cycles shrink @xcite .",
    "we study this theory at one fixed point , with fractional branes that extend only in the space - time directions . in this context",
    "it is enough to consider only one cycle for each fixed point . by thinking of the resolved space in the neighborhood of one fixed point , the geometrical counterparts of the twisted gauge fields @xcite are the kaluza - klein @xmath26 forms",

    "consider , for example , the kinetic term in the ten dimensional lagrangian ( [ bulk ] ) for the rr 3-form : @xmath35 if we decompose as in ( [ kk ] ) @xmath36 we get a standard term in the six - dimensional effective lagrangian @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",

    "this does not depend on the normalization of the ( 1,1 ) form @xmath30 and it has to take the value @xmath50 .    in this paper",
    "we want to test the validity of the geometric approach just described by explicitly computing string scattering amplitudes .",
    "to do this , we need the string mode fluctuations for canonically normalized fields . in our case",
    "they take the form ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath51    in the next paragraphs we examine all the linear and quadratic couplings of the closed strings to the d - brane and compare them with the results we can predict from the action ( [ sbif ] ) , finding complete agreement .",
    "on general grounds the properties of d - branes can be discussed either by studying their interaction with open strings @xcite or by introducing the boundary state ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary state is a brst invariant state written in terms of the closed string oscillators .",
    "it encodes the couplings of the d - branes with all states of the closed string spectrum and inserts a boundary on the closed string world sheet enforcing on it the appropriate boundary conditions . in an orbifold background like ( [ bg ] ) it has four different components which correspond to the ( usual ) ns - ns and r - r untwisted sectors and to the ns - ns and r - r twisted sectors @xcite , ( for a more detailed analysis see appendix [ aboundary ] ) .",
    "generally it provides two essential information : the couplings with the massless closed string states ( from which we read the mass and the charges ) and their long distance behaviour ( from which we study the space time geometry ) @xcite .",
    "we are going to analyze the first aspect in the following subsection .",
    "the generator of the interaction amplitudes of any closed string state with a fractional d@xmath0-brane is the following boundary state : @xmath52 where ( see appendix [ aboundary ] ) : @xmath53    the various amplitudes can be computed by simply saturating @xmath54 with the properly normalized closed string states . for example the twisted ns - ns scalar @xmath55 , which is related to the fluctuations of the @xmath47 field of ( [ b ] ) , is represented by the following vertex operator : @xmath56 we have written it in the ( -1,-1 ) superghost picture , since this is the appropriate picture to use with the boundary state @xcite .",
    "then the coupling between @xmath55 and a fractional d@xmath0-brane will be given by :    @xmath57    we see that this coupling is in perfect agreement with what we get from the action ( [ sbif ] ) .",
    "we can now proceed analogously for all other massless states that can couple to the d - brane . here",
    "we simply list the results ( see appendix [ avertices ] for the explicit expressions of the vertices ) , since the explicit calculations are identical to those already discussed in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath58 where the fields @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 have been defined in ( [ edefcanonic ] ) , and the longitudinal matrix @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is @xmath66 and encodes the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions . for later convenience",
    "we also introduce the matrix n @xmath67 with components only in the directions normal to the brane .",
    "it is easy to check that the couplings ( [ res ] ) are in agreement with those prescribed by the action ( [ sbif ] ) .",
    "there are two equivalent ways to reconstruct the quadratic couplings of the closed string states with a d@xmath0-brane from the conformal theory .",
    "one approach is to use the boundary state , sew it with a string propagator and saturate it with the vertices of the two external states @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this approach has been used in @xcite to obtain the anomalous coupling of a d - brane with the @xmath70 field and also non - anomalous couplings with curvature terms @xcite . the other approach is instead to evaluate the correlator of the vertices on the disk .",
    "this latter method has been discussed in @xcite for ordinary d - branes of type ii and extended in @xcite for branes of type 0 .    in the boundary states approach ,",
    "the amplitude describing the coupling of two closed string states is given by : vertex at @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the topological normalization respectively for the sphere and for the states @xcite , and @xmath74 is the usual closed string propagator : @xmath75 the overlap equations defining @xmath76 allow us to identify the right movers with the left movers by means of the @xmath77 matrix ( [ esse ] ) encoding the information about the longitudinal and the transverse directions . after this identification",
    "the right movers operators appear only in the boundary exponential and annihilate the left or right vacua ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the other approach is to evaluate the correlator of the vertices on the disk @xcite . here",
    "one can use the _ doubling trick _ to duplicate the region inside the disk to fill the whole complex plane .",
    "this is done introducing the matrix @xmath65 ( [ esse ] ) .",
    "the conformal invariance of the disk allows us to fix three ( real ) parameters for the four punctures and leaves just one modulus to be integrated over .",
    "in this way we get the right correlator for the vertices , but we do not determine the right normalization involving the tension of the brane .",
    "perfect equivalence between the two approaches is reached by adding in the latter case an overall multiplication factor @xmath78 or @xmath79 ( see appendices [ aboundary ] and [ avertices ] for our conventions ) according to the required boundary sector ( [ eboundary ] ) .    in order to get the interaction vertices of the boundary action",
    ", we must perform the low energy limit @xmath80 .",
    "it is crucial to realize that the string amplitudes in this limit exhibit two types of divergences which are due to the exchange of massless particles in the _",
    "s- _ and _ t - channel _ ( fig . [ fdisklowenergy ] ) .",
    "so , we must evaluate these diagrams and subtract them from the string amplitudes .    to evaluate the _",
    "t - channel _ exchange diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fdisklowenergy ] ) , we need the @xmath81 bulk action ( [ bulk ] ) suitably compactified @xcite .",
    "in fact we evaluate it with the sewing technique : we start from the couplings of the boundary with an intermediate state , propagate it in the bulk and finally sew with a three point interaction vertex read from the compactified bulk action .",
    "of course , the exact cancellation of the divergences requires the sum on all possible intermediate states .",
    "the _ s - channel _ diagram represents the interaction of the external states with an open string state living on the brane . in this case , the two interaction points can be obtained by string theory techniques because now they are irreducible .",
    "so , for each external states we correlate its vertex with an intermediate open string vertex , and then sew together with the proper propagator .    in ten dimensions",
    "this technique has been successfully applied in @xcite to reproduce the world volume action ( [ bi ] ) .",
    "we want to extend it to the orbifold compactification in order to reproduce the action describing the world volume interactions of the fractional branes ( [ sbif ] ) . in this case",
    "there is a larger variety of states and we summarize in table [ tqcoup ] all possible quadratic couplings . for shortness and notation convenience",
    "we introduce a @xmath82 matrix @xmath83 according to table [ tqcoup ] , to easily identify the sectors we will refer to .",
    "for example the symbol @xmath84 means a string amplitude between a closed string of the r - r untwisted sector , a closed string state of the ns - ns twisted sector and the boundary state ; its explicit expression is : @xmath85    @xmath86    each element of this matrix @xmath83 must reproduce some of the terms of the boundary action .",
    "so , for example , we have : @xmath87    the calculation of these terms and their correspondence with the appropriate boundary action has been discussed respectively in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the case of a flat background in ten dimensions .",
    "here we have performed the same calculation in the case of the orbifold compactification and , apart from some obvious changes , the same structure is recovered .",
    "we will concentrate here on the amplitudes involving one particle in a twisted sector , which are specific of the fractional branes ; we consider : @xmath88 the explicit expressions for the vertices are given in appendix [ avertices ] .    for example , for the amplitude @xmath89 we get : @xmath90 where @xmath91 are respectively the momentum transferred to the brane and the longitudinal one .",
    "the kinematic factors in ( [ eq13 ] ) are : @xmath92 { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the polarization of the first state in the ns - ns untwisted sector .",
    "so by choosing the appropriate @xmath93 we select the graviton , kalb - ramond or dilaton field .",
    "in the low energy limit @xmath80 , we note the amplitude is divergent : @xmath94    as explained before , we must subtract these divergences owing to the field theory diagrams .",
    "let s start with the t - channel . for definiteness we will consider the interaction between @xmath59 and @xmath55 .",
    "the only three point interaction vertex we can read from the bulk action is the kinetic term of the scalar @xmath55 : @xmath95 now we must sew the corresponding field theory amplitude @xmath96 with the propagator @xmath97 for the twisted scalar and finally with the linear coupling with the brane ( [ elinbeta ] ) : @xmath98    next , let s consider the s - channel . we need to evaluate the interaction between the external states and an intermediate open string state @xmath99 living and propagating on the brane .",
    "these @xmath100 fields represent the excitations of the transverse coordinates @xmath101 , whose expectation values correspond to the brane position ; they appear only in the pull back of the metric @xmath102 . with our normalization for the boundary action ( [ sbif ] ) , from the kinetic term we can read the propagator : @xmath103    now , instead of evaluating the interaction from the string",
    ", we will show an equivalent and shorter way @xcite .",
    "the idea is to imagine the interaction of a generic state as coming from the boundary action interpreted as the first order of a taylor series in the transverse coordinates .",
    "considering the field @xmath55 as in the example , we can read the coupling from the next to linear order of ( [ elinbeta ] ) : @xmath104 analogously , the interaction between @xmath105 and @xmath99 gets two contributes : @xmath106 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first is the next to linear order of the taylor expansion and the second appears directly in the pull back @xmath107 .",
    "sewing all together we get : @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using the relation ( [ long],[enne ] ) and ( [ ecinema ] ) , we can subtract the divergent part of ( [ eampdivergent ] ) in all the amplitudes . in terms of the _ standard _ fields ( [ edefcanonic ] ) directly appearing in the action ( [ sbif ] ) , we obtain : @xmath109    similar calculations for the other massless closed string modes yield : @xmath110    these are exactly the couplings we expect from the action ( [ sbif ] ) .",
    "by directly examining various string scattering amplitudes , we have extracted various world - volume interactions for the effective field theory on fractional d - branes .",
    "our results are in perfect agreement with the born - infeld and wess - zumino terms of the action ( [ sbif ] ) , numerical coefficients included",
    ". a further check could be to evaluate the quadratic coupling involving two twisted states explicitly .",
    "as already emphasized , the techniques we have used are rather general .",
    "in particular it could be interesting to apply them to the case of fractional branes extended also in the compact directions .",
    "there are indeed many reasons to argue that the resulting space time configurations are extended objects with a smaller density of mass and charges .",
