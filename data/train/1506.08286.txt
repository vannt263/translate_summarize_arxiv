    "the swimming speed is always increased by the presence of a second fluid , potentially by order of magnitude when the wavelength of the swimmer and its radius are large compared to the thickness of the low - viscosity layer .",
    "in this paper , we presented a physical mechanism for the locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid .",
    "the physical idea is that phase - separation near the surface of the swimmer leads to the presence of a low viscosity layer which promotes slip and decreases viscous friction . as a way to intuitively rationalize the results in our paper , we note  as is well known  that the locomotion in a fluid is governed by the ratio between the drag coefficients for the motion relative to the fluid perpendicular to and along the surface of the swimmer @xcite .",
    "the presence of a fluidic interface , or of a finite slip length , affects normal hydrodynamic forces only weakly but leads to a systematic decrease of tangential viscous forces , and hence should always lead to faster swimming , as observed here . in a different context , but with some physical similarities , swimmers also always enhance their swimming speed in a network of polymer molecules @xcite and in a porous medium  @xcite .     beyond the traditional geometrical assumptions made in our paper which are similar to a number of classical studies ( namely solving the swimming problems for small amplitude motion and perfectly sinusoidal waveforms ) , one severe restriction of our two - fluid approach is the assumption that the interface between the two fluids remains flat .",
    "this is akin to saying that the time scale of the waving motion is much faster than the time scale for the readjustment of the interface , which is a reasonable assumption only for large fluid viscosities . that flat interface then provides an effective confinement to the swimmer , which is known to enhance locomotion @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated physicochemical model including molecular details of the phase separation would be required to solve for the dynamics of the thin film and to untangle the relative importance of viscosity difference vs.  confinement in the increase of the swimming speed .",

    ", we saw that when the wall depletion layer is very thin , the enhancement can be very large .",
    "a recent experiment by gagnon , shen and arratia  @xcite considered the locomotion of the nematode _ c. elegans _ in concentrated polymer solutions and showed that the swimming speed can be increased significantly , by up to @xmath146 . is our model consistent with this result ?",
    "the thickness of the low - viscosity layer in concentrated polymer solutions is a complex function of mean diameter of the particles and the concentration but can be estimated using the empirical formula @xcite @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the mean diameter of the particles , @xmath149 the particle volume fraction , and @xmath150 the maximum packing fraction .",

    "the wavelength of the swimming worm is @xmath155  mm , and the dimensionless diameter @xmath137 is about 0.1 . when the ratio of the viscosities @xmath92 changes from 0.01 to 0.5 , the enhancement predicted by our model is about @xmath156 , which is less than a factor of two away from the experimental results , and indicates that our simplified approach captures the essential physics of the swimming enhancement .",
