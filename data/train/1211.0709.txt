    "terrorist and insurgent networks are known for their ability to regenerate leadership after targeted attacks .",
    "for example , the infamous al qaeda in iraq terrorist leader abu musab al - zarqawi was killed on june 8th , 2006   only to be replaced with abu ayyub al - masri about a week later .   here ,",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ shaping _ operation in which the terrorist network is first targeted for the purpose of reducing its leadership re - generation ability .",
    "such shaping operations would then be followed by normal attacks against high value targets  however the network would be less likely to recover due to the initial shaping operations . in this paper , we look to shape such networks by increasing network - wide centrality , first introduced in @xcite . intuitively , this measure provides insight into the criticality of high - degree nodes .",
    "hence , a network with a low network - wide centrality is a more decentralized organization and likely to regenerate leadership . in the shaping operations introduced in this paper",
    ", we seek to target nodes that will maximize this measure - making follow - on attacks against leadership more effective .",
    "previous work has primarily dealt with the problem of leadership regeneration by focusing on individuals likely to emerge as new leaders  @xcite . however ,",
    "targeting or obtaining information about certain individuals may not always be possible .",
    "hence , in this paper , we target nodes that affect the reduce the _",
    "network s _ ability regenerate leadership as a whole .",
    "the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of a formal problem we call _ fragility _ ( section  [ prelim - sec ] ) which seeks to find a set of nodes whose removal would maximize the network - wide centrality .",
    "we also included in the problem a `` no strike list '' - nodes in the network that can not be targeted for various reasons .",
    "this is because real - world targeting of terrorist or insurgent networks often includes restrictions against certain individuals .",
    "we also prove that this problem is np - complete ( and the associated optimization problem is np - hard ) which means that an efficient algorithm to solve it optimally is currently unknown .",
    "we then provide two algorithms for solving this problem ( section  [ algsec ] ) .",
    "our first algorithm is an integer program that ensures an exact solution and , though intractable by our complexity result , may be amenable to an integer program solver .",
    "then we introduce a greedy heuristic that we show experimentally ( in section  [ expsec ] ) to provide good results in practice ( as we demonstrate on six different real - world terrorist networks ) and scales to networks of @xmath3 nodes and @xmath4 edges . in examining five real - world terrorist networks",
    ", we found that successful targetting operations against only @xmath0 ( or less ) of nodes can increase the network - wide centrality between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , we discuss related work further in section  [ rwsec ] .",
    "we would like to note that the targeting of individuals in a terrorist or insurgent network does not necessarily mean to that they should be killed .",
    "in fact , for `` shaping operations '' as the ones described in this paper , the killing of certain individuals in the network may be counter - productive .",
    "this is due to the fact that the capture of individuals who are likely emergent leaders may provide further intelligence on the organization in question .",
    "we assume that an undirected social network is represented by the graph @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , we assume a `` no strike '' set , @xmath6 .",
    "intuitively , these are nodes in a terrorist / insurgent network that can not be targeted .",
    "this set is a key part of our framework , as real - world targeting of terrorist and/or insurgents in a terrorist / insurgent network is often accompanied by real - world constraints .",
    "for example , consider the following :    * we may know an individual s relationships in the terrorist / insurgent network , but may not have enough information ( i.e. where he or she may reside , enough evidence , etc . ) to actually target him or her .",
    "* the potential target may be politically sensitive .",
    "* the potential target may have fled the country or area of operations but still maintains his or her role in the terrorist / insurgent network through electronic communication . * the potential `` target '' may actually be a source of intelligence and/or part of an ongoing counter - intelligence operation ( i.e. as described in @xcite ) .    throughout this paper we will also use the following notation .",
    "the symbols @xmath7 will denote the sizes of @xmath8 respectively . for each @xmath9 , we will use @xmath10 to denote the degree of that node ( the number of individuals he / she is connected to ) and @xmath11 to denote the set of neighbors and we extend this notation for subsets of @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath14 to denote all edges in @xmath15 that are adjacent to node @xmath16 and the notation @xmath17 to denote the maximum degree of the network . given some subset @xmath18",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath19 to denote the subgraph of @xmath20 induced by @xmath21 .",
    "we describe an example network in example  [ zeroex ] .",
    "[ zeroex ] consider network @xmath22 in figure  [ ex1fig ] .",
    "nodes @xmath23 and @xmath24 may be leaders of a strategic cell that provides guidance to attack cells ( nodes @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "note that no members in the attack cells are linked to each other .",
    "also note that if node @xmath23 is the leader , and targeted , he could easily be replaced by @xmath24 .    ) for example  [ zeroex ] . ]",
    "we now introduce the notion of network - wide degree centrality as per @xcite . the key intuition of this paper is to use this centrality as a measure of the network s ability to re - generate leadership .",
    "[ firstdefine ] the degree centrality of a network @xmath20 , denoted @xmath27 is defined as : @xmath28    we note that there are other types of network - wide centrality ( i.e. network - wide betweenness , closeness , etc . ) .",
    "we leave the consideration of these alternate definitions of network - wide centrality to future work .",
    "freeman  @xcite shows that for a star network , the quantity @xmath29 equals @xmath30 - and this is the maximum possible value for this quantity .",
    "hence , the value for @xmath27 can be at most @xmath31 .",
    "as this equation is clearly always positive , network - wide degree centrality is a scalar in @xmath32 $ ] . turning back to example  [ zeroex ]",
    ", we can compute @xmath33 - which seems to indicate that in this particular terrorist / insurgent network that , after leadership is targeted , there is a cadre of second - tier individuals who can eventually take control of the organization . throughout this paper , we find it useful to manipulate equation  [ firstdef ] as follows .",
    "@xmath34    we notice that the centrality of a network really depends on three things : number of nodes , number of edges , and the highest degree of any node in the network .",
    "we leverage this re - arranged equation in many of our proofs .",
    "further , we will use the function @xmath35 to denote the level of network - wide of the graph after some set of nodes is removed .",
    "hence , @xmath36 .",
    "we note that this function has some interesting characteristics .",
    "for example , for some subset @xmath37 and element @xmath38 , it is possible that @xmath39 or @xmath40 , hence @xmath41 is not necessarily monotonic or anti - monotonic in this sense .",
    "further , given some additional element @xmath42 , it is possible that @xmath43 or @xmath44 . hence , @xmath41 is not necessarily sub- or super- modular either .",
    "consider example  [ ex1 ] .",
    "[ ex1 ] consider the network @xmath22 in figure  [ ex1fig ] .",
    "here , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the fact that @xmath49 and @xmath50 illustrate that @xmath51 is not necessarily monotonic or anti - monotonic .",
    "now let us consider the incremental increase of adding an additional element .",
    "adding @xmath52 to @xmath53 causes @xmath51 to increase by @xmath54 while adding @xmath52 to @xmath55 causes @xmath51 to decrease by @xmath56 - implying sub - modularity .",

    "this problem is well - known to be np - hard .",
    "first we create a new network @xmath5 which consists of graph @xmath82 but with @xmath83 additional nodes which form a star that is disconnected from the rest of the network .",
    "all of the new nodes are put in the no - strike set @xmath65 ( part of the input of @xmath73 ) .",
    "clearly , the center of this star is always the most central node in the graph , no matter what is removed from set @xmath84 .",
    "this allows us to treat @xmath17 as a constant equal to @xmath85 .",
    "also note that with this construction , for both problems , if a solution exists of less than size @xmath63 , there also exists a solution of exactly size @xmath63 .",

    "+ the proof of correctness of the embedding rests on proving that a `` yes '' answer is returned for the vertex cover problem iff + @xmath87 .",
    "+ first , suppose by way of contradiction ( bwoc ) there is a `` yes '' answer to the @xmath76 problem and a `` no '' answer to the corresponding @xmath73 problem .",

    "if we remove the corresponding nodes from @xmath20 , there are @xmath89 edges left in that network .",

    "let @xmath21 be the nodes in the solution to @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , this set is of size @xmath63 and by how we set up the no - strike list ( @xmath65 ) , there are corresponding nodes in @xmath91 .",
    "as these nodes cause a `` yes '' answer to @xmath73 , they result in the removal of @xmath92 number of edges in @xmath20 . by the construction ,",
    "none of these edges are adjacent to nodes in @xmath65 . hence , there are corresponding edges in @xmath82 . as",
    "this is also the number of edges in @xmath82 , then this set is also a vertex cover - hence a contradiction .",
    "hence , as we have shown membership in np and that this problem is at least as hard as the dominating set problem ( resulting in np hardness ) , the statement of the theorem follows .",
    "@xmath74 is np - hard    follows directly from theorem  [ fnpc ] .",
    "now with the problems and their complexity identified , we proceed to develop algorithms to solve them .",
    "first , we develop an integer program that , if solved exactly , will produce an optimal solution .",
    "we note that solving a general integer program is also np - hard .",
    "hence , an exact solution will likely take exponential time .",
    "however , good approximation techniques such as branch - and - bound exist and mature tools such as qsopt and cplex can readily take and approximate solutions to integer programs .",
    "we follow our integer program formulation with a greedy heuristic .",
    "though we can not guarantee that the greedy heuristic provides an optimal solution , it often provides a natural approach to approximating many np - hard optimization problems .",
    "our first algorithm is presented in the form of an integer program .",
    "the idea is that certain variables in the integer program correspond with the nodes in the original network that can be set to either @xmath93 or @xmath31 .",
    "an objective function , which mirrors the @xmath94 function is then maximized .",
    "when this function is maximized , all nodes associated with a @xmath31 variable are picked as the solution .    for each @xmath9 ,",
    "create variables @xmath95 . for each undirected edge @xmath96 , create three variables : @xmath97 .",
    "note that the edge is considered in only `` one direction '' for the @xmath98 variables and both directions for the @xmath99 variables .",
    "we define the @xmath100 integer program as follows :    @xmath101    subject to : @xmath102    next we prove how many variables and constraints @xmath100 requires as well as prove that it provides a correct solution to @xmath74",

    "_ suppose , bwoc , @xmath106 is not an optimal solution to @xmath74 .",
    "then there is some @xmath109 that is .",
    "suppose @xmath107 and @xmath108 . clearly , by the definition of a solution to @xmath74 , constraints  [ kconst],[nosconst ] and [ zerooneconst ] are all met .",
    "constraints [ adjedge1 ] and [ adjedge2 ] set variables associated with edges adjacent to nodes not in @xmath21 to @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the quantity @xmath110 is equal to the number of edges in the network .",
    "the @xmath98 edge variables ( both of them for each edge ) are also set in a similar manner .",
    "constraints  [ justonemax],[zeroonemax ] ensures that only one set of such edge variables are set to @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the quantity @xmath111 is the degree of one node in the network .",
    "as this quantity is present in the objective function and non - negative , it corresponds to the @xmath17 . as we note that @xmath112 is equal to the number of nodes in @xmath20 when @xmath21 is removed , we see that this function is @xmath41 . as this quantity",
    "is maximized , we have a contradiction .",
    "+ _ ( 2 . ) _ suppose , bwoc , @xmath107 and @xmath108 is not an optimal solution to @xmath100 .",
    "using the same line of reasoning as above , we see that the objective function of @xmath100 is the same as @xmath41 , which also gives us a contradiction .",
    "note that this integer program does not have a linear objective function .",
    "however , this can be accommodated for by instead solving @xmath63 different integer programs and taking the solution from whichever one returns the greatest value for the objective function ( that is greater than the initial network - wide degree centrality , of course ) . in this case , each integer program is identified with a natural number @xmath113 and the @xmath16th integer program has the following objective function : @xmath114 as well as constraint  [ kconst ] as follows : @xmath115    notice that now the quantities @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be treated as constants , making the objective function linear . however , for networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution where @xmath118 , it is likely that only the integer program for the case where @xmath119 is needed as removing any node with edges that is unconnected to a maximal degree node will result in an increase in network - wide degree centrality .",
    "again , we stress that @xmath100 provides an exact solution .",
    "as integer - programming is also np - hard , solving these constraints is likely intractable unless @xmath120 .",
    "however , techniques such as branch - and - bound and mature solvers such as qsopt and cplex can provide good approximate solutions to such constraints .",
    "even if the integer program must be linear , we can use the techniques described above to solve @xmath63 smaller integer programs or obtaining an approximation by treating the terms involving the total number of nodes in the resulting graph ( in the objective function ) as constants .",
    "additionally , a relaxation of the above constraints where @xmath121 and @xmath122 variables lie in the interval @xmath32 $ ] is solvable in polynomial time and would provide a lower - bound on the solution to the problem ( although this would likely be a loose bound in many cases ) .",
    "the integer program introduced in the last section can be leveraged by an integer - program solver for an approximate solution to @xmath74 .",
    "however , it likely will not scale well to extremely large networks .",
    "therefore , we introduce a greedy heuristic to find an approximate solution .",
    "the ideas is to iteratively pick the node in the network that provides the greatest increase in @xmath94 - and does not cause a decrease .",
    "network @xmath5 , no - strike set @xmath6 , cardinality constraint @xmath63 subset @xmath123    .",
    "the following two propositions describe characteristics of the output and run - time of @xmath124 , respectively .    if @xmath124 returns a non - empty solution ( @xmath21 ) , then @xmath67 and @xmath125 .",
    "as the algorithm terminates its main loop once the cardinality of the solution reaches @xmath63 and as in each iteration , the variable @xmath126 is initialized as zero , the statement follows .",
    "@xmath124 runs in @xmath127 time .",
    "we note that @xmath94 is computed in @xmath128 time as it must update the node with the maximum degree .",
    "as the outer loop of the algorithm iterates at most @xmath63 times and the inner loop iterates @xmath129 times , the statement follows .",
    "though our guarantees on @xmath124 are limited , we show that it performs well experimentally in the next section .",
    "[ greedy - ex ] following from examples  [ zeroex]-[ex1 ] using the terrorist / insurgent network @xmath22 from figure  [ ex1fig ] , suppose a user wants to identify @xmath130 nodes that will cause the network to become `` as fragile as possible '' and is able to target any node .",
    "hence , he would like to solve @xmath131 and decides to do so using @xmath124 .",
    "initially , @xmath45 . in the first iteration , it selects and removes node * a * , increasing the fragility ( @xmath132 ) . in the next iteration , it selects node * j * , giving us @xmath133 .",

    "various aspects of the resiliency of terrorist networks have been previously explored in the literature .",
    "for instance , @xcite studies the ability such network to facilitate communication while maintaining secrecy while @xcite studies how such networks are resilient to cascades .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the network - wide degree centrality in such networks - and how to increase this property - has not been previously studied .    there has been much work dealing with the removal of nodes from a network to maximize fragmentation  @xcite where the nodes removed are mean to either increase fragmentation of the network or reduce the size of the largest connected component . while this work has many applications , it is important to note that there are special considerations of terrorist and insurgent networks that we must account for in a targeting strategy .",
    "for instance , if conducting a counter - intelligence operation while targeting , as in the case of @xcite , it may be desirable to preserve some amount of connectivity in the network .",
    "additionally , fragmentation of a network may result in the splintering of an organization into smaller , but more radical and deadly organizations .",
    "this happens because in some cases , it may be desirable to keep certain terrorist or insurgent leaders in place to restrain certain , more radical elements of their organization . such splinter was observed for the insurgent organization jaysh al - mahdi in iraq  @xcite .",
    "further , these techniques do not specifically address the issue of emerging leaders .",
    "hence , if they were to be used for counter - terrorism or counter - insurgency , they would likely still benefit from a shaping operation to reduce organization s ability to regenerate leadership .",
    "there has been some previous work on identifying emerging leaders in terrorist networks .",
    "although such an approach could be useful in identifying certain leaders , it does not account the organizations ability as a whole to regenerate leadership . in @xcite , the topic of _ cognitive demand _",
    "is studied .",
    "the cognitive load of an individual deals with their ability to handle multiple demands on their time and work on complex tasks .",
    "typically , this can be obtained by studying networks where the nodes may represent more than individual people - but tasks , events , and responsibilities .",
    "however , it may often be the case that this type of information is often limited or non - existent in many situations . additionally ,",
    "as discussed throughout this paper , the targeting of individual nodes may often not be possible for various reasons .",
    "hence , our framework , that focuses on the _ network s ability to regenerate leadership _ as opposed to finding individual emerging leaders may be more useful as we can restrict the available nodes in our search using the `` no strike list . '' by removing these nodes from targeting consideration - but by still considering their structural role - our framework allows a security force to reduce the regenerative ability of a terror network by `` working around '' individuals that may not be targeted .    in more recent work",
    "@xcite looks at the problem of removing leadership nodes from a terrorist or criminal network in a manner that accounts for new links created in the aftermath of an operation .",
    "additionally , @xcite look at identifying leaders in covert terrorist network who attempt to minimize their communication due to the clandestine nature of their operations .",
    "they do this by introducing a new centrality measure called `` covertness centrality . ''",
    "both of these approaches are complementary to ours as they focus on the leadership of the terrorist or insurgent group - as this approach focuses on the networks ability to re - generate leadership . a more complete integration of this approach leadership targeting method such as these ( i.e. using a network - wide version of covertness centrality ) is an obvious direction for future work .",
    "in this paper we described how to target nodes in a terrorist or insurgent network as part of a _ shaping _ operation designed to reduce the organization s ability to regenerate leadership .",
    "our key intuition was to increase the network - wide degree centrality which would likely have the effect of eliminating emerging leaders as maximizing this quantity would intuitively increase the organization s reliance on a single leader . in this paper , we found that though identifying a set of nodes to maximize this network - wide degree centrality is np - hard , our greedy approach proved to be a viable heuristic for this problem , increasing this quantity between @xmath150 in our experiments .",
    "future work could include an examination of other types of network - wide centrality  for instance network - wide closeness centrality  instead of network - wide degree centrality .",
    "another aspect that we are considering in ongoing research is determining the effectiveness of the shaping strategy when we have observed only part of the terrorist or insurgent organization  as is often the case as such networks are created from intelligence data .",
