    "complex oxides offer the potential to replace conventional semiconductors in a range of devices due to reduced feature sizes and added functionality ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the polar interface between laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto )  @xcite has shown promise as a field effect transistor  @xcite .",
    "one problem hindering its development is the low mobility of the interface two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) . to progress , the origin of the 2deg must be understood .",
    "explanations proposed to date can be classed into three categories : ( @xmath2 ) electron transfer countering the  polar catastrophe \" @xcite , ( @xmath3 ) doping through o vacancies in the film @xcite or in the substrate @xcite , and ( @xmath4 ) cation intermixing at the interface @xcite .",
    "growth conditions have been shown to affect the observed behavior , particularly o@xmath5 partial pressure and post - annealing treatments , affecting carrier density and confinement to the interface ( as opposed to conduction through the sto substrate ) @xcite .",
    "the polar catastrophe  @xcite arises from a polarization discontinuity between the non - polar sto substrate and polar lao film  @xcite . in lao films grown on",
    "tio@xmath5 terminated sto substrates this polar discontinuity induces a divergence of the electric displacement field ( @xmath6 ) in the pristine system equal to considering the effective polarization response and net effective charges @xmath7 of precisely @xmath8 and @xmath9 per formula unit at the interface and surface , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic potential then builds up across the lao film , accumulating electrostatic energy . to counter it a charge transfer between the interface and the surface",
    "is required . a mechanism intrinsic to the pristine system",
    "is given by the transfer of electrons from the surface to the interface . from band bending arguments , electrons are transferred from the o 2@xmath10 at the top of the valence band at the lao surface , to the ti 3@xmath1 conduction band at the interface , once the potential drop across the lao layer reaches the effective band gap , which is calculated to happen for a lao thickness of five unit cells ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and within ) .",
    "however the absence of a 2d hole gas at the surface and the observation of populated ti 3@xmath1 states for films as thin as one or two bilayers  @xcite raises doubts about this mechanism .",
    "two important points should be kept in mind .",
    "firstly , the samples are generally not kept or measured in vacuum .",
    "the surface can thus be covered by adsorbants like water , and it will likely be far from an ideal surface termination , possibly including chemical alterations such as the hydroxylation seen on many wet oxides .",
    "the second point is more central , however : whatever the chemistry , the relevant electrostatics across the film can only be affected by processes in which charge is altered at each side of the film , either by charge transport across it , or by charges arriving at either side from external reservoirs .",
    "if there are no such external sources and the chemical processes are confined to the surface , the remaining possibility is that of surface redox processes . they transform surface bound charge into free - carrier charge , the electrons or holes then being free to move to the buried interface .",
    "the clearest and quite relevant example is that of oxygen vacancy formation whereby surface o@xmath11 anions transform into o@xmath5 molecules , releasing two electrons to the @xmath12 interface , as illustrated in fig .",
    "surface protonation @xcite is an analogous process in which the surface is also reduced by the oxidation of o@xmath11 into o@xmath5 , although in this case the process depends on the presence of water , h@xmath5o@xmath13 1/2 o@xmath14h@xmath15 , and both the energetics and kinetics will be different from the previous one @xcite .",
    "the protons attach to the surface o atoms , while the electrons are again free to go to the @xmath12 interface ( note that the non - redox hydroxylation , h@xmath5o@xmath13 oh@xmath16h@xmath15 , does not affect the electrostatics across the film ) .    in section ii we present a model for the formation of surface redox processes .",
    "we then apply the model to the lao / sto system in section iii using parameters obtained from first - principles calculations ( see appendix ) .",
    "we show that , for such a surface redox process , ( @xmath2 ) the process is favored by film thickness through the effect of the electric field across the film ; ( @xmath3 ) the growth of the density of the related surface defects with film thickness is predicted , showing a minimum critical thickness ; ( @xmath4 ) the model is in excellent agreement with first principles calculations and reasonable agreement with what is observed experimentally for ti 3@xmath1 occupation ; ( @xmath17 ) the potential drop across the film does not change substantially with thickness once vacancies start to appear ; ( @xmath18 ) for thin films the carriers at the interface are still trapped by the electrostatic potential generated by the vacancies in deep double - donor states : a strongly disordered two - dimensional electron system ; ( @xmath19 ) as thickness increases the levels become shallower and the number density increases , closing the gap to the conduction band ; ( @xmath20 ) the conduction onset is therefore at a higher film thickness than the one for interfacial carrier population . finally we note that the model can also be applied to @xmath10-type interfaces and ultra thin ferroelectric films , where alteration of the surface chemistry has also been proposed as a possible screening mechanism ( see for example ref .",
    "we consider a pristine polar thin film on a non - polar substrate defining a @xmath12-type interface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and a surface reduction process ( the model can be trivially extended to @xmath10-type interfaces and surface oxidizing reactions , see below , and to ferroelectric thin films ) . the introduction of a surface defect via a redox reaction produces a donor level in the gap .",
    "the defect provides @xmath21 electrons ( two for an o vacancy ) that can transfer to the interface ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , thus contributing to the screening of the polarization or compositional charge @xmath7 at either side of the polar film ( @xmath22/f.u . in lao  @xcite ) .    considering this electron migration , we can model the formation energy of one such surface defect , @xmath23 , in the presence of an area density @xmath12 of surface defects as @xmath24 where we have separated an electrostatic term associated with the internal electric field in the film , @xmath25 , from a surface / interface chemistry term , @xmath26 , and a term accounting for defect - defect interactions other than electrostatic in a mean - field sense .",
    "it can be seen as arising from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the formation energy of an isolated surface defect in the absence of a field across the film , and where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are defined in fig . 1  .",
    "@xmath28 ( and thus @xmath26 ) depends on the particular surface chemical process , and the reference chemical potential for the relevant redox counterpart species in the environment , e.g. @xmath31 , which depends on experimental conditions .",

    "4 assumes no screening by electronic reconstruction , which is right if the onset for defect stabilisation happens earlier than the one for electronic reconstruction .",

    ", much smaller than the predicted thickness dependence for the electronic screening model , and consistent with recent xps measurements , which show no core level broadening with film thickness  @xcite .",
    "the pinning of @xmath60 is also consistent with reduced cation - anion relative displacement with increasing lao thickness as measured by sxrd  @xcite .",
    "the redox processes proposed above explain the absence of hole - mediated transport at the surface , while electrons allow 2d conduction at the interface .",
    "an important observation that remains unexplained , however , is the fact that the onset of interfacial ti 3@xmath1 occupation , as measured with haxpes  @xcite , happens at lower film thickness than the onset for interfacial 2d conduction  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the 2deg lies in several ti 3@xmath1 sub - bands , some of which are not mobile due to anderson localization  @xcite . whether anderson localization occurs on an energy scale as high as room temperature depends on the energy scale of the disorder distribution .",
    "the surface defects associated to the redox processes represent point sources of effective charge , very much as a dopant in a semiconductor @xcite , e.g. @xmath61 @xmath62 for an o vacancy .",
    "they then generate trapping potentials for the carriers at the interface plane of the form @xmath63 in atomic units , where @xmath1 is the film thickness and @xmath64 corresponds to the radial variable in the plane .",

    ". these trapped interface levels may be the in - gap states seen in a recent spectroscopic study @xcite .",
    "for a thin film the traps are deep and few , but as it grows thicker , the donor states become shallower _ and _ the area density of traps grows , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "a transition from insulating to conducting behavior is thus expected at a larger film thickness than the critical thickness for surface defect stabilization . with growing thickness",
    ", not only dopant levels tend to overlap as in a degenerate semiconductor , but the doping - level band is pushed towards the conduction band . for @xmath66 , as for o vacancies , the physics of this transition is that of band overlap and disorder , since all dopant states are doubly occupied . if the mechanism involves @xmath67 defects , as in the hydroxylation case , the transition will be rather mott - anderson , as each dopant state is singly occupied .",

    "a recent afm study of lao / sto has proposed the mechanism for conductivity switching  @xcite as the writing of surface charge  @xcite . applying a biased tip to the surface",
    "alters the field across the lao film which either increases or decreases the stability of vacancies ( and hence @xmath46 ) depending on the sign of the bias .",
    "an implication of this observation is that the kinetics for these redox processes is accessible at room @xmath72 as used in these experiments , not only the much higher @xmath72 used for growth .",
    "the model proposed can also be used for @xmath10 interfaces , holes , acceptor levels and surface oxidation processes .",
    "this would be the case for lao grown on sro terminated sto .",
    "it is less symmetric than it seems , however , since , in addition to different energetics and chemical potentials , the large conduction band offset at the interface ( @xmath29 in fig .",
    "1 ) favors the situation for electrons towards @xmath12 interfaces much more than the much smaller valence band offset for holes and @xmath10-interfaces . for thin film ferroelectrics with outwards ( inwards ) polarization on metallic substrates ,",
    "the important alignment becomes the acceptor ( donor ) level with the metal fermi level .",
    "this could be behind the stability of switchable ultra thin ferroelectric films under open circuit conditions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that in lao / sto , the onset of electrostatic modulation doping is precluded by the thermodynamic creation of surface defects and thus carrier mobilities produced by this method will be much lower than at a pristine interface .",
