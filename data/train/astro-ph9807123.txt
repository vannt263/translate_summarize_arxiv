    "since the mid eighties ( woodard & noyes 1985 ) there has been clear evidence that the frequencies of acoustic oscillations in the sun change with the solar cycle .",
    "these frequency shifts have now been observed over the period of a solar cycle ( elsworth _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , jimen ' ez - reyes 1998 ) , and frequency differences of the order of a few hundred of nanohertz have been found between the two extremes of the cycle .    since then , a significant amount of work has been undertaken in order to study the dependence of these shifts on many parameters , such as the frequency , degree and azimuthal order of the modes , as well as on different time - scales and on the different epochs of the solar cycle . as a result of these studies",
    "it was shown that the frequency shifts vary with frequency and degree of the modes in a way that is proportional to the inverse of the mode inertia ( libbrecht & woodard 1990 ) , suggesting that this effect is due to a change at the surface , rather than due to a change in the structure of the sun s interior .",
    "the dependence on the azimuthal order , on the other hand , allowed for the study of the latitudinal dependence of the surface perturbation frequency shifts ( kuhn 1988 , gough 1988 , libbrecht & woodard 1990 , woodard & libbrecht 1993 ) , showing that it follows the latitudinal variations of the effective temperature .",
    "moreover , with another solar maximum coming up , new results are starting to appear ( dziembowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) which seem to agree well with those of the previous solar cycle .    the time - scales on which the frequency variations take place were also the subject of several studies .",
    "in addition to the long - term variations following the period of the solar cycle , woodard _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) and bachmann & brown ( 1993 ) found short - term frequency changes , taking place over periods as short as one month .",
    "more recently , jimen ' ez - reyes ( 1998 ) also found such short - term frequency shifts , this time using low - degree data .",
    "the good correlation between the long - term frequency shifts and several solar - cycle indices ( e.g bachmann & brown 1993 , elsworth _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , jimen ' ez - reyes 1998 ) supports the idea that these changes are due to either the direct effect of the magnetic field on the oscillations or its indirect effect , via changes in the sun s thermal structure , or both .",
    "exactly which of these effects is the most important is still unknown , although efforts have been made to reconcile the observed frequency shifts with the magnetic activity and the surface brightness variations ( goldreich _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , balmforth _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , kuhn 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , considering the effect of the magnetic field on the frequency shifts , it is still uncertain which magnetic regions contribute more significantly for these shifts .",
    "is it the quiet sun , the sunspots , or other magnetically active regions ?",
    "the theories that explore the direct effect of the magnetic field on the frequencies commonly use a regular perturbation method , which is valid only when the magnetic perturbations are small , breaking down in regions such as sunspots , where the magnetic field is strongly concentrated near the surface . as a result ,",
    "the contributions arising from such regions are difficult to assess .",
    "knowledge about the extent to which various regions and effects ( thermal or magnetic ) influence the solar frequencies would help us to know what solar cycle indices we should be correlating the frequency shifts with .",
    "a possible way to study the effect of localized structure variation could be via time - distance helioseismology . in the present work we use the modal in combination with the time - distance approach to helioseismology in an attempt to isolate the contribution of sunspots to the frequency shifts of normal modes .",
    "our eventual goal is to relate the time delays as observed by time - distance helioseismology of sunspots to the frequency shifts of global modes .",
    "thus we can establish a lower limit for frequency shifts caused by the sunspots and predict the dependence on the frequency of the time delays suffered by rays travelling through a region with a surface anomaly .",
    "recently sunspots have been studied seismically by two completely different methods .",
    "the first one uses a fourier - hankel decomposition of the solar oscillations in the vicinity of the sunspot to calculate the complex amplitudes of inwardly and outwardly propagating p modes ( ` modal approach ' ) ( braun , duvall , & labonte 1988 ; braun , labonte , & duvall 1990 , braun _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; bogdan _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; braun 1995 ) .",
    "these studies generally find an attenuated amplitude of the outwardly propagating wave and a positive phase shift relative to the inwardly propagating wave .",
    "the second method measures the temporal cross - correlation between oscillations recorded at two diametrically opposite points on a circle centred on the sunspot ( see fig.[a ] ) ( duvall _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; duvall 1995 ; korzennik , noyes , & ziskin 1995 ; dsilva , & duvall 1995 ; duvall _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; dsilva _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; kosovichev 1996 ; braun 1997 ) .",
    "the signature of the sunspot manifests itself in travel - time anomalies relative to their quiet - sun counterparts . assuming geometrical acoustics to be valid , duvall ( 1995 ) deduced a phase shift of 30@xmath0 induced by one particular sunspot ( corresponding to a time delay of 0.56 min at 3 mhz ) .",
    "various models have been invoked to explain the observed phase shifts and the attenuation of the amplitude , including downflows beneath sunspots or conversion to slow magnetoacoustic waves within the sunspot . however , to date , no conclusive explanation has been found .",
    "in fact , in most cases the interpretation of the observations is still subject to speculation .",
    "the idea behind the work we present here is to relate these travel - time anomalies to changes in eigenfrequencies of acoustic modes .",
    "we first concentrate on the analysis of normal modes , and choose a radius @xmath1 in the region of propagation of the eigenmode which is below the region perturbed by the sunspot but still close to the surface ( fig .",
    "[ match ] ) .",
    "note that , even if the sunspot extends considerably into the sun s interior , its effect is important only near the surface , due to the rapid downward increase in the gas pressure , and , therefore , it is always possible to choose a suitable value for @xmath1 . in the interior of the sun , defined here as the region between the centre and @xmath1 , the oscillations obey the usual equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore , we can express any perturbation above @xmath1 as a change in the boundary condition applied to these equations at @xmath2 .",
    "this change in the boundary condition at @xmath2 generates a shift in the eigenfrequencies of the modes , and it is precisely this shift that we want to obtain . in principle , the change in the boundary condition will not only change the eigenfrequencies of the modes but also the eigenfunctions , which will no longer be proportional to single spherical harmonics , as result of the latitudinal dependence of the new boundary condition . fortunately , however , it is possible to use a variational principle to relate the change in the boundary condition to the frequency shifts , while avoiding the tedious work of calculating the perturbed eigenfunctions .",
    "the variational principle can be expressed as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the unperturbed frequency , @xmath5 is the sound speed , @xmath6 is the vertical wavenumber and @xmath7 is the change in the phase of the local eigenfunction at @xmath2 , which constitutes the change in the boundary condition to which we referred above . the bar over the phase shift stands for the average over latitude , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a spherical harmonic .",
    "so , equation ( [ eq : dw ] ) can be used to convert a perturbation in the local phase of the eigenmode at @xmath2 into a shift in its eigenfrequency .",
    "having obtained the relation between phase shift and frequency shift , the next step is to infer this phase shift from the travel - time anomalies produced by the sunspots . to do that ,",
    "let us go back to the ray paths and consider again a wave travelling between any two surface points a and b. the starting point a can be regarded as a source point of waves , each travelling in a different direction .",
    "therefore , at point b the wave travelling horizontally will interfere with the wave travelling along the ray path joining a and b. the condition for constructive interference is that ( gough 1984 ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wavenumber along the ray path , @xmath12 is the horizontal wavenumber and @xmath13 is a phase which accounts for any phase jump that the ray may suffer on reflection .    but @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the frequency of the wave considered and @xmath16 is its phase velocity .",
    "therefore , writing the travel time of the wave as @xmath17 , equation ( [ eq : quantization ] ) becomes : @xmath18 now , from time - distance analysis we know that the travel time is altered by the presence of a sunspot .",
    "so , if we write the new travel time as @xmath19 and substitute it in equation ( [ eq : quantization2 ] ) , we get an extra phase jump of @xmath20 .",
    "the last step consists in relating the phase jump @xmath21 to the shift in the phase of normal modes , @xmath7 .    using the equation describing the ray paths , equation ( [ eq : quantization2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 .",
    "this last equation resembles the quantization equation for normal modes , which is usually written as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the upper turning point of the eigenmode , @xmath26 is the radial order of the mode and @xmath27 is yet another phase . perturbing equation ( [ eq : quantization4 ] ) and relating it to equation ( [ eq : quantization ] ) , where @xmath13 is perturbed due to the sunspot , we find : @xmath28 where @xmath25 is the upper turning point of the normal mode .",
    "but the phase jump @xmath7 in the normal modes is just @xmath29 and , therefore , substituting @xmath7 back in equation ( [ eq : dw ] ) , we obtain for @xmath30 modes : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ratio between the sunspot area and the surface area of the sun .    at this point it is probably a good idea to stop and explore equation ( [ eq : dw2 ] ) more carefully . as was mentioned in section 1 , it is known from observations that the frequency shifts of global modes follow the inverse of the mode inertia .",
    "the contributions to the frequency shifts from the sunspot regions have a similar dependence .",
    "hence , we can predict the dependence of @xmath33 on the frequency of the rays considered , by writing , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "we hope that in the near future it will be possible to test this frequency dependence of the time delays against observational data .",
    "another point that deserves some attention is the dependence of the frequency shifts on the degree @xmath36 of the modes . aside from the dependence on @xmath36 due to the mode inertia",
    ", the frequency shift varies with the degree of the mode also due to the asphericity of the surface perturbations . equation ( [ eq : dw2 ] )",
    "was written for the case @xmath30 , but it is straightforward to write an equivalent expression for other degrees simply by using the definition ( [ eq : avalfa ] ) to take the average of equation ( [ eq : shif2 ] ) , and substituting it in equation ( [ eq : dw ] ) . having done that , it is possible to compare the outcome with frequency shifts suffered by modes of different degrees , and , in principle , extract information about the asphericity of the perturbations , since perturbations at different locations in the sun affect modes of different degrees in different ways .    in this work",
    "we use the time delays published by duvall ( 1995 ) .",
    "the area covered by sunspots at a given time was obtained from the international relative sunspot number , where , the area in millionths of the visible hemisphere is given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the relative sunspot number . using those data we obtain for a mode of degree @xmath30 and a frequency of 3 mhz , a frequency shift of about one tenth of the observed frequency difference between the two extremes of the solar cycle for a mode with the same characteristics .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that this value is only a lower limit to the contribution of the sunspots to the variations in the eigenfrequencies . in our calculation",
    "we have ignored two effects that will increase this contribution : firstly , in the upper layers of the sun geometric acoustics breaks down and , consequently , we must allow for diffraction effects when relating the observed time delay with the phase jump @xmath21 induced by the sunspots .",
    "as we shall see in section 4 , this phase jump is actually larger than the value deduced from geometrical acoustics ; secondly , the area cover by sunspots ( as far as interaction with acoustic waves is concerned ) might be larger than the observed penumbral area .",
    "when a wave is incident on an obstacle in its path , in addition to the undisturbed wave , there is a scattered wave which spreads out from the scatterer in all directions and which distorts and interferes with the original wave . if the obstacle is very large compared with the wavelength , i.e. in the limiting case of geometrical acoustics , the scattered wave interferes with the undisturbed wave in such a way as to create a sharp - edged shadow behind the object .",
    "however if the size of the obstacle is comparable with the wavelength , a variety of diffraction phenomena occur .    here",
    "our scattering body is the sunspot , which we model as a patch on the solar surface whose effect is to induce a fixed phaseshift @xmath39 upon all incident rays .    notwithstanding the fact that the asymptotic ray description breaks down at the upper turning point and that the linearised adiabatic wave equation is not even valid there , let us consider a ray originating at a point a as shown in fig.[d ] .",
    "the wavefield @xmath40 observed at point b due to all singly reflected rays from a source at point a can be represented by the undisturbed reflected ray ( continuous curve ) plus the ray that is scattered off the sunspot ( dashed curve ) :",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the acoustic waves , @xmath42 is the wave travel time of the reflected ray and @xmath43 that of the scattered wave .",
    "the amplitude @xmath44 is essentially the scattering strength of the sunspot , which depends on the physical properties of the sunspots as well as the exact shape of the ` trapping potential ' , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the acoustic cut - off frequency ) at the upper turning point .",
    "we omitted here the @xmath47 dependence of the amplitudes because the lengths of the paths of the reflected and scattered ray are nearly equal ( identical for plane - parallel polytrope ) .",
    "since the waves propagate nearly vertically at the upper turning point , we are neglecting any angular dependence of the scattered wave .",
    "also we are ignoring any possible angular variation in the amplitude of the incident wave field .    in the born approximation to scattering ,",
    "this scattering strength is proportional to the area of the sunspot .",
    "thus , by observing sunspots of different sizes , one might be able to constrain @xmath44 .",
    "the time delay caused by a sunspot as a function of the offset from the spot of the origin of the circle over which the signal is averaged ( see fig.[a ] ) has been measured by duvall ( 1995 ) , and is shown in fig.[b ] .",
    "fig.[b ] can be reproduced by averaging equation ( [ eq1 ] ) over all azimuthal angles for a particular offset of the sunspot from the centre of the observation ring and the result is shown by the dotted line in fig.[b ] .",
    "it is important to notice that different sets of pairs of scattering strengths , @xmath44 , and phase shifts , @xmath39 , can yield the same time delays in fig.[b ] . in fig.[g ] we have plotted those scattering strengths versus those phase shifts that are compatible with the measurement of fig.[b ] .",
    "we note that in order to produce a time delay of 0.56 minutes the scattering strength has to lie between 0.6 and 1.0 , causing the phase shift induced by the sunspot to lie between 1.05 and 1.55 rad .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , it is not possible to evaluate the phase shift induced by a sunspot from the observed time delay alone , unless we know the scattering strength of the sunspot .",
    "however , a simple model suggests that this phase shift lies between 1.05 and 1.55 radians .",
    "the correction to the value obtained for the contribution from sunspots to the frequency shifts depends on this phase shift . moreover , it depends on the effective area of the sunspots ( i.e. , the area of interaction with the acoustic waves ) , which might be larger than that observed .",
    "therefore , using the minimum value for the phase shift obtained from the observed time delays , we conclude that the contribution to frequency shifts coming from sunspots is greater than one fifth",
    ". it might be significantly greater if the effective area of the sunspots is larger than that observed , or if the phase shifts induced by the sunspots is larger than the minimum value required to reproduce duvall s measurements .",
    "we have shown how the changes of the frequencies of acoustic modes during the solar cycle can be related to the time delays induced by sunspots .",
    "we have demonstrated that the time delays found in the presence of a sunspot can not be converted unambiguously into a phase shift due to a sunspot without the knowledge of its scattering strength .",
    "we can , however , set limits on the maximum and minimum values of the phase shift , those being 1.05 and 1.55 radians , respectively .    accordingly , at the present",
    ", we can give only a lower limit to the contribution from the sunspots to the frequency variations of global modes ; this lower limit is about one fifth of the observed frequency shifts .",
    "moreover , by relating the frequency shifts to the time delays as determined by the time - distance analysis of sunspots , we predict the frequency dependence of these time delays to follow equation ( [ eq : dtau ] ) .",
    "we hope that in the near future time - distance observations will be able to test the latter prediction , as well as to provide sufficient data on sunspots of different sizes in order to allow for the determination of the scattering strength of the sunspots as a function of their effective area .",
    "this will yield a more accurate estimate of the contribution of sunspots to the frequency shifts of global modes .",
