    "in the past few years , high angular resolution millimeter / radio - wave observations have facilitated rapid development in our understanding of some fundamental aspects of protoplanetary disk evolution .",
    "for example , there is mounting evidence for substantial discrepancies between the spatial distributions of mm - sized dust particles and molecular gas in protoplanetary disks , possibly caused by a dramatic decrease in the dust - to - gas ratio at large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . coupling those results with new analyses that identify a systematic decrease in dust particle sizes in the outer disk @xcite",
    ", there seems to be good progress toward the promise of empirical constraints on the key processes tied to the growth and migration of disk solids .",
    "meanwhile , there has been marked improvement in the characterization of another key factor in disk evolution : dynamical interactions with companions .",
    "@xcite provided a sweeping quantitative confirmation of the seminal work by @xcite , demonstrating that tidal interactions in multiple star systems are a prominent issue for disk survival , especially for separations in the @xmath13 - 30au range . and",
    "@xcite ( among others ) have speculated that the ring - like millimeter - wave dust continuum emission morphologies noted for the so - called  transition \" disks are most likely created by an analogous dynamical interaction process , though in this case the perturbers may be embedded _ planetary _ companions .    for the time being ,",
    "most of these data - driven studies of disk evolution are somewhat piecemeal in terms of both diagnostics and target samples , due to practical observational limitations . while that should soon change dramatically with the completion of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) facility , it is important to recognize that some individual targets will always serve as particularly illuminating case studies for different aspects of disk evolution . here , we focus on the disk around v4046 sgr , a remarkable system with observable characteristics that are likely simultaneously shaped by _ all _ of the fundamental processes involved in disk evolution .",
    "v4046 sgr is a double - lined spectroscopic binary with a 2.4-day orbital period @xcite .",
    "radial velocity monitoring indicates a nearly equal - mass pair of k - type stars on a close ( @xmath4au ) , circular ( @xmath5 ) orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that gsc 07396@xmath600759 could be an additional distant ( @xmath128 ) companion , which itself might be an unresolved close binary ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "two independent , dynamical methods to estimate the v4046 sgr stellar masses are in agreement , with @xmath7 and @xmath8m@xmath9 for the primary and secondary , respectively @xcite .",
    "coupling these dynamical mass measurements to the inferred temperatures and luminosities , pre - main sequence evolution models suggest that v4046 sgr has an age of @xmath110 - 20myr @xcite .",
    "those ages are consistent with the conjecture of @xcite that v4046 sgr is a member of the @xmath10 pic moving group , with a kinematic parallax distance of only 73pc from the sun .",
    "evidence for a disk around the v4046 sgr binary first came from emission line accretion signatures ( h@xmath11 equivalent widths of @xmath130 - 120 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an infrared continuum excess in the _ iras _ bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . strong ( sub)millimeter emission was detected by @xcite , suggesting a relatively large disk mass . @xcite",
    "modeled the infrared sed and concluded that it was consistent with an extended circumbinary disk truncated at an inner edge radius of @xmath10.2au , as would be expected from dynamical interactions with the central binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "later , @xcite discovered a substantial reservoir of molecular gas in the disk orbiting v4046 sgr , which was subsequently imaged and found to span @xmath1800au in diameter ( roughly 10  on the sky ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fitting an elliptical gaussian to their 230ghz continuum visibilities , @xcite suggested that the mm - wave dust emission is concentrated inside a @xmath140au radius .",
    "taken together , these properties make the v4046 sgr system a significant benchmark for studies of protoplanetary disk evolution for three key reasons .",
    "first , the advanced age of the disk suggests that evolutionary effects have had more time to progress , and therefore should exhibit more obvious observational signatures than for a typical @xmath11myr - old disk .",
    "evolutionary mechanisms like particle growth and migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gas dissipation via photoevaporative winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should all be relevant in shaping disk properties at the v4046 sgr age .",
    "for reference , such disks are rare : v4046",
    "sgr harbors the _ only _ gas - rich disk in the @xmath10 pic moving group , and is one of a handful of gas - rich disks known to be associated with t tauri stars in local young stellar groups ( the others orbit tw hya , mp mus , and t cha ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the proximity of v4046 sgr is a substantial practical advantage in measuring key evolutionary diagnostics : the same observations would be @xmath12 more sensitive and probe 2@xmath2 smaller spatial scales for v4046 sgr compared to disks around younger t tauri stars that are associated with the nearest star - forming clouds ( at distances @xmath13pc ) . and",
    "third , from the perspective of a stellar host , v4046 sgr introduces some interesting environmental issues that could influence the evolution of its disk . aside from dynamical clearing due to its stellar multiplicity , the binary at the center of the v4046 sgr disk makes for an unusual dichotomy .",
    "the combined mass of the two central stars means that dynamical timescales in the disk are relatively short .",
    "however , the irradiation environment is not much different than for a single star , so timescales tied to thermal , energetic , or chemical processes are comparatively unaffected .",
    "in essence , the evolutionary behavior of the v4046 sgr disk can be described as a hybrid of a typical herbig ae disk and t tauri disk , depending on the relevant timescale that dominates a given evolution mechanism .    in this article , we present new , sensitive , high angular resolution observations of the 1.3 mm continuum and @xmath14co/@xmath15co / c@xmath16o @xmath17=2@xmath61 line emission from the v4046 sgr circumbinary disk . using these data and a suite of radiative transfer tools , we aim to construct a preliminary , representative model of the disk structure in an effort to help characterize the observational signatures of different disk evolution mechanisms . in the following sections , we describe our observations with the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the relevant data calibration procedures (  2 ) ,",
    "present some basic observational results (  3 ) , develop models for the disk structure (  4 ) , and comment on their implications for our understanding of disk evolution (  5 ) .",
    "a summary is provided in  6 .",
    "we observed v4046 sgr with the submillimeter array ( sma ; * ? ? ? * ) on mauna kea , hawaii on four occasions in 2009 and 2011 .",
    "these observations and their calibration were already described by @xcite and @xcite , but a brief summary of the key points is provided here for completeness . in these observations ,",
    "the individual 6-m array elements were arranged in each of the four available sma configurations , spanning baseline lengths from 8 to 509 m .",
    "the dual - sideband receiver backends and sma correlator were configured with a local oscillator ( lo ) frequency of 225.360ghz ( 1.33 mm ) and a @xmath12ghz - wide intermediate frequency ( if ) band @xmath184 - 6ghz from the lo : in 2011 , a second if band was included @xmath186 - 8ghz from the lo .",
    "each sideband / if band combination was composed of 24 spectral chunks of 104mhz width ( although typically only the central 82mhz are used ) . in the first",
    "if band , three chunks ( in each sideband ) were split into 512 spectral channels , to sample the co isotopologue emission at 200khz ( @xmath10.25 km s@xmath19 ) resolution .",
    "all other chunks were coarsely split into 32 channels ( 3.25mhz each ) to observe the continuum .",
    "observations of v4046 sgr were interleaved with visits to j1924 - 292 ( @xmath115  away ) on a 5 - 15minute cycle , as well as j1733 - 130 ( 22  away ) on a @xmath145minute cycle .",
    "additional observations of 3c 454.3 and available planets / satellites ( neptune , ceres , callisto ) were conducted for calibration purposes .",
    "a summary of relevant observational parameters is provided in table [ tab : obs ] .    the visibility data in each if band and from each sma observation were calibrated independently using the mir package , as described by @xcite .",
    "after confirming their consistency over all if / sideband combinations and on overlapping baseline lengths , the continuum data were spectrally averaged .",
    "spectral visibilities that cover each co isotopologue transition were continuum - subtracted and combined .",
    "the overall data quality is exceptional for the sma and the low declination of v4046 sgr , due primarily to the excellent observing conditions ( precipitable water vapor levels were only @xmath11 mm throughout all of the observations ) .",
    "synthesis images were made using the clean deconvolution algorithm in the miriad software package for each emission tracer .",
    "for the 1.3 mm continuum , we emphasized the emission on smaller spatial scales with a briggs robust ( -1 ) weighting scheme , resulting in a map with a @xmath20 synthesized beam ( at p.a .",

    "analogous channel maps of the co isotopologue lines were made by employing a 05 gaussian taper , producing a slightly larger synthesized beam ( @xmath23 ) and a similar rms noise level ( @xmath135mjy beam@xmath19 ) .",
    "a summarized representation of the sma observations of v4046 sgr is provided in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "the synthesized map of 1.3 mm dust continuum emission is shown in figure [ fig : summary](a ) , with contours starting at 5mjy beam@xmath19 ( 5@xmath24 ) and increasing at 10mjy beam@xmath19 ( 10@xmath24 ) intervals .",
    "the integrated flux density recovered in this map is @xmath25mjy ( dominated by a 10% systematic calibration uncertainty ) , consistent with a reasonable extrapolation from single - dish submillimeter photometry measurements @xcite .",
    "we find the mm - wave emission is concentrated in a bright , narrow ring centered at the mean stellar position ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , j2000 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a double - peaked morphology due to limb brightening at the projected ring ansae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent rotation between the semi - major axis of the disk and the line joining the two ansae is mostly an artifact of the @xmath28 sampling and is reproduced in our models ( see  [ sec : model3 ] ) .",
    "these emission peaks are separated by 075 ( @xmath155au ) and have peak intensities of @xmath29mjy beam@xmath19 ( dominated by a 10%  calibration uncertainty ; s / n @xmath30 50 ) .",
    "the western peak appears slightly brighter ( @xmath15mjy beam@xmath19 ) than its eastern counterpart , but a proper evaluation of the significance of this discrepancy requires a more detailed analysis ( see  5 ) .",
    "the emission ring itself is at best only marginally resolved , implying a width smaller than the 04 ( @xmath130au ) minor axis of the synthesized beam .",
    "figure [ fig : summary](b ) shows the azimuthally - averaged profile of the real and imaginary continuum visibilities as a function of deprojected baseline length , constructed assuming the disk viewing geometry derived by @xcite ( @xmath31 , pa@xmath32 ) . the visibility amplitudes exhibit the distinctive oscillation pattern that is characteristic of an emission ring , with nulls at @xmath1150 and 350k@xmath33",
    "the zero - spacing amplitude is estimated to be @xmath1315mjy , suggesting that roughly 10%  of the total flux density from the disk was filtered out of the synthesized map in figure [ fig : summary](a ) : presumably that emission is distributed on larger scales with low surface brightness .",
    "these sma continuum measurements demonstrate that the v4046 sgr binary joins the growing ranks of stars that host massive protoplanetary",
    " transition \" disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a central cavity of radius @xmath129au ( see  [ sec : model3 ] ) that is substantially depleted of mm - sized dust particles .",

    "@xcite point source catalogs , and an archival _ spitzer _ irs spectrum .",
    "the sed features the standard signature of a transition disk , with a distinctive  dip \" in the continuum near 10@xmath3 m suggesting that small , warm dust is preferentially depleted ( although _ not _ absent ; see  [ sec : model1 ] ) near the central binary .",
    "an accurate determination of the size of this putative cavity from the sed alone is not trivial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the very weak excess in the near - infrared makes it clear that the dust optical depths must be significantly diminished within at least a few au of the central stars .",
    "note that the observed dip in the continuum covers a much wider wavelength range than was inferred by @xcite .",
    "simulations of interactions between a stellar binary and its circumbinary disk suggest that the disk material should be inwardly truncated at a radius @xmath12 - 5@xmath2 the binary separation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : for v4046 sgr , the disk truncation should occur at @xmath10.2au , much smaller than the continuum data suggest .",
    "therefore , the observed dust cavity is _ not _ related to interactions with the central binary .",

    "therefore , we fixed @xmath135 , a typical value for disks @xcite . the inner radius of the model was set to @xmath136au , the outer edge of the zone expected to be cleared by dynamical interactions with the central binary @xcite . for the gas phase , we assumed a standard , spatially uniform dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "after some iteration between dust and gas structures , we identified a model that can reproduce well both the broadband sed and sma observations of co line emission : the results are highlighted in figure [ fig : modsum1 ] . using the morphology of the continuum  dip \" in the infrared sed , we inferred a cavity radius @xmath138au , roughly 15@xmath2 larger than could be explained by tidal stripping from the v4046 sgr binary .",
    "as with most other transition disks , this cavity is not empty : the weak infrared excess ( and weak silicate emission feature ) noted in fig .",

    "one possible source for that heating is the strong x - ray emission from the central binary ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "although by design this model provides a good match to the sed and co emission , it should be obvious from figure [ fig : modsum1 ] that it is irreconcilable with the resolved 1.3 mm continuum data .",
    "however , these failures are instructive in refining the model . the residuals in figures [ fig :",
    "modsum1](c)-(d ) point out two key issues .",
    "first , the cavity size derived from the sed alone substantially under - estimates the size that can be _ directly _ measured from the resolved 1.3 mm data . in  3 , we estimated a cavity radius of @xmath129au ( and will quantify that further below ) , @xmath110@xmath2 larger than derived here .",
    "this kind of discrepancy is not uncommon for transition disks ( e.g. , dm tau ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : any inference of a size scale from unresolved observations is inherently uncertain and may be a signature of how the dynamics of grains depends upon their size ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "second , the spatial extent of this model is much larger than the 1.3 mm continuum distribution .",
    "this latter point is manifested in the poor match to the visibility profile in figure [ fig : modsum1](c ) on large spatial scales ( short baselines ) , where the model is clearly more resolved than the data permit ( the negative residuals outside the emission ring in figure [ fig : modsum1](d ) represent the same aspect of this model failure ) .",
    "since @xmath123 was determined from the co data , this discrepancy is not surprising : we already highlighted in  3 how the co emission is much more extended than the dust emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] ) .      informed by the failures of the previous model , we shift the focus here to building a model that is more consistent with the resolved morphology of the 1.3 mm dust emission .",
    "two prescriptions for the surface density profile are presented , both of which can reproduce the size and shape of the mm - wave emission . considering the visibility profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : summary]a ) , the former is constrained by the short baselines ( @xmath151k@xmath33 ) and the latter is dictated by the position of the null and deep trough at higher spatial frequencies .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig : modsum2a ] are for the same relative ratios of midplane and atmosphere grains and model parameterization defined in ",
    "[ sec : model2 ] , but with the the cavity size , @xmath126 , enlarged to 21au ( i.e. , adjusted without regard to the infrared sed ) .",
    "in addition , this model has @xmath152 , @xmath153au , @xmath154 , @xmath155au at @xmath147au , and 0.0011@xmath156 of dust .",
    "note that a negative @xmath124 implies a density profile that _ rises _ with radius out to @xmath123 , but then is sharply truncated .",
    "in essence , it naturally produces a relatively narrow  ring \" of material @xcite , making it a practical means of describing the resolved morphologies of transition disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also consider an alternative parameterization of the surface density profile where the viscous disk similarity solution , @xmath157 ( see eq .",

    "although both of these models reproduces well the morphology of the 1.3 mm emission ring ( figs .",
    "[ fig : modsum2a],[fig : modsum2]c , d ) , they each fail to account for the observations of the v4046 sgr disk in three similar , illuminating ways .",
    "we also experimented with alternative prescriptions for the surface densities ( e.g. , a power - law with an outer edge cut - off ) , and found qualitatively similar results .",
    "first , they produce too deep and wide of a  dip \" in the infrared sed in figures [ fig : modsum2a],[fig : modsum2](b ) , because there is not enough dust interior to the density peak .",
    "note that the mid / far - infrared excess of the models is a manifestation of this lack of inner disk material : in the absence of an inner disk , a larger surface area of more distant material in the model ring can be directly illuminated by the central stars , producing a  bump \" in the continuum at @xmath150@xmath3 m .",
    "second , if we assume a standard , uniform dust - to - gas ratio as before ( @xmath160 ) , there is not enough gas outside the density peak in either of these models to account for the observed spatial extent of the co emission ( figs .",
    "[ fig : modsum2a],[fig : modsum2]e , f ) . for a constant @xmath73 ,",
    "this size discrepancy is present regardless of the assumed co abundance or gas temperature distribution , although the results in figures [ fig : modsum2a ] and [ fig : modsum2 ] use the same @xmath109 and @xmath149 that were adopted in  4.2.1 . and third",
    ", the models do not quite generate enough 1.3 mm dust emission on large angular scales ( deprojected baselines @xmath16150k@xmath33 ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : modsum2a],[fig : modsum2]c ) .",
    "the origins of this last discrepancy are indeed subtle .",
    "we are unable to account for all the emission through a simple scaling of the dust mass because the model ring is already nearly optically thick ( this is exacerbated by our assumption of isotropic scattering off large , spherical grains ) . increasing the densities",
    "further effectively impedes the radiation transfer to the midplane , making the dust cooler and actually _ decreasing _ the 1.3 mm luminosity .",
    "instead , we interpret this emission mismatch as an intrinsic model deficiency : the addition of a low - density , spatially - extended dust component could reconcile the model visibilities with the data . note that this faint ( @xmath110 - 15%  of the total flux ) emission  halo \" would be strongly spatially filtered in the synthesized images , as was found for the sma observations in  3 .",
    "the three different models constructed above illustrate the key features of the v4046 sgr disk structure . to review those results ,",
    "we have identified three basic structural elements that are required in any model prescription that aims to successfully reproduce the observations :    1 .",
    "the vast majority of the large grain population must be strongly concentrated in a _",

    "a reservoir of small dust particles ( which produce little mm - wave emission ) at radii of a few au are required to account for the morphology of the infrared sed ; 3 .   a large - scale ,",
    "extended halo structure is necessary to explain the co line emission size and a faint , strongly spatially filtered 1.3 mm continuum component , but there appears to be substantially less mass in the large dust particles relative to the gas outside the concentrated ring component .    here",
    ", our goal is to combine the successful aspects of the models described above into a hybrid structure that incorporates these three elements and is commensurate with all of the observations .",
    "we define a surface density profile for the dust that is composed of three individual components , each corresponding to one of the structural elements enumerated above : @xmath162 we elect to use simple gaussian profiles for the distribution of material in the ring and inner disk components , @xmath163,\\ ] ] where we define parametric constants that correspond to peak radii \\{@xmath164 , @xmath165 } , profile widths \\{@xmath166 , @xmath167 } , and normalizations \\{@xmath168 , @xmath169 } for both structure components separately .",

( 11 ) is arbitrary , and was selected entirely for purposes of convenience in the radiative transfer modeling ( tying the exponential turnover scale to the ring component center makes a joint exploration of the model space less cumbersome ) .",

    "the gas is assumed to follow the small grains in both the halo and inner disk components separately ",
    "i.e. decoupled from the large grain population  each with a ratio @xmath73 .",
    "we use the halo gas profile as an upper limit on the surface density of midplane grains in the ring . for radii where the ratio between the two would exceed unity ( e.g. in the space between the two gaussian distributions ) , we reduce @xmath171 to equal the gas surface density from the halo component . either increasing the gas or reducing the dust density has no significant effect upon our observables since the subtended region is very narrow and the densities are already low .    a model constructed with the recipe outlined above is superior to those presented in ",

    ", we have kept @xmath160 fixed as before .",
    "the total ( gas+dust ) mass in this model is @xmath10.094m@xmath9 and the disk - integrated dust - to - gas mass ratio is @xmath10.047 .",
    "we have presented sensitive , high angular resolution sma observations of the 1.3 mm dust continuum and spectral lines of three co isotopes from the v4046 sgr circumbinary disk .",
    "we have modeled the dust and gas structures and identified three fundamental signatures of profound evolution in this disk .",
    "first , the majority of the large grains are distributed in a narrow ring centered creating a large central cavity ( @xmath180au ) .",
    "second , there exists a significant population of @xmath3m - sized grains that have not been cleared from the center of this cavity .",
    "third , the gas disk extends much farther than the compact dust ring , suggesting that this disk has a radial variation in the dust - to - gas mass ratio .    to explain the striking discrepancy between the size of the gas and dust distributions , we invoke a model with a strong radial variation in the relative mass ratio of the large , midplane grains and the gas .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the model is large at the dust ring ( @xmath181  @xmath182 ) and small outside of it ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "similar discrepancies between the gas and dust distributions have been noted for other disks , such as those around i m lup @xcite , tw hya @xcite , and lkca 15 @xcite .",
    "while our preferred model does feature an extended , but tenuous , dusty halo , models where the dust uniformly follows the gas disk either produce too much continuum or too little co emission at large radii and clearly disagree with the observations ( see  [ sec : model1 ] and  [ sec : model2 ] ) .",
    "we caution that the model @xmath14co and @xmath15co line emission is optically thick and so the derived dust - to - gas mass ratios are upper limits .",
    "additionally , the dust mass in the model is sensitive to the dust opacities and so other values of the dust - to - gas mass ratio and total disk mass are possible .",
    "the precise form and normalization of @xmath117 are model dependent , but the observations seem to suggest that it is a strongly decreasing function .    while the underlying physical cause of the discrepancy between the size of the gas and dust distributions is not clear , there is a natural explanation in the growth and inward radial drift of dust particles @xcite .",
    "drift is a fundamental feature in the migration of disk solids , generated because the radial pressure gradient in the disk causes the gas to rotate at slightly sub - keplerian velocities while the dust particles are on keplerian orbits .",
    "the resulting headwind creates a drag - force on the dust that relates to the size of the particle , preferentially moving the large particles towards the central star @xcite . as these particles drift inwards",
    ", their size distribution is continuously evolving as they encounter higher local densities that are conducive to growth @xcite .",
    "the collective effect is to shrink the radial extent of the dust mass distribution , as the gas disk continues to viscously spread to larger radii @xcite .",
    "since these processes operate on dynamical timescales , this phenomenon should be particularly pronounced for the v4046 sgr disk due to the binarity ( increased @xmath184 ) and advanced age of its stellar hosts . resolved observations taken across the ( sub-)millimeter and radio bands may clarify whether the radial grain size distribution is consistent with this drift and particle growth scenario @xcite .    in order to reproduce the observed morphology of the mm continuum emission , we required a model that has its large dust grain population distributed in a narrow ring .",
    "this is suggestive of a physical mechanism acting to both concentrate the particles radially and prevent them from moving further into the inner disk .",
    "particle growth alone is insufficient to produce mm - wave cavities @xcite , but this kind of ring - like dust concentration is a natural consequence of particle evolution models that also employ feedback from a large - scale maximum in the radial pressure gradient of the gas @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the dust particles are strongly dictated by the surrounding gas and while negative radial pressure gradients induce inward radial drift , a _ positive _ pressure gradient may stop the dust as it streams towards the star .",
    "this pressure maximum forms a `` pocket '' that collects dust and , if sufficiently broad and high - amplitude , can significantly alter the observed continuum emission @xcite .    while many physical phenomena may generate these particle traps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we focus on an origin in the density maximum at a gap edge produced by dynamical interactions between a low - mass companion embedded in the gas disk @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite produced a ring of large grains in a broad surface density bump exterior to the radius of such a gap .",
    "furthermore , their models of the mutual evolution of the gas and dust predicted a strong radial variation in the dust - to - gas mass ratio ( see their figure 6 ) with heavily depleted dust densities in the outer disk ( @xmath183  @xmath185 ) and a large concentration within the trap ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "both the ring - shaped surface density profile and radially decreasing dust - to - gas ratio produced by their calculation were necessary features of the model we derived for the v4046 sgr disk .",
    "recent models that account for the expected substructure in these ring - like pressure traps suggest that a modest variation in the gas density ( peak - to - valley amplitude ratio of @xmath1871.5 ) can produce strong azimuthal asymmetries in the dust distribution @xcite",
    ". this phenomenon may be sufficient to qualitatively explain some observations of the `` lopsided '' emission from some transition disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . as noted in",
    "[ sec : results ] , the western peak of the v4046 sgr dust ring appears slightly brighter than the eastern peak by @xmath188mjybeam@xmath19 .",
    "we find that this subtle asymmetry is apparent in the continuum visibilities as well , and therefore is not likely to be an artifact of the imaging / deconvolution process .",
    "figure [ fig : asym ] shows a cut of the imaginary component of the complex visibilities binned along the @xmath189-axis in the fourier plane ( corresponding to the e - w direction ) . for a symmetric morphology , the imaginary visibilities should be zero : however , we find a statistically significant deviation in a sinusoid pattern .",
    "the asymmetry can be reproduced reasonably well with a faint point source ( @xmath18mjy ) located @xmath1023 to the west of the disk center .",
    "however , verification and characterization of this low - level apparent asymmetry beyond such a simple model will require observations with higher resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the ring - shaped dust disk and tentative asymmetry seem to be well - matched to predictions for a large pressure trap generated by a companion interacting with the gas disk . however , the central spectroscopic binary itself is too compact and circular to have dynamically truncated the disk at such a large radius : this scenario requires ( at least ) a third body .",
    "one constraint on the properties of a putative companion comes from the dynamical mass estimate by @xcite .",
    "since this method utilizes the keplerian rotation pattern of the disk , it is sensitive to the cumulative mass at the disk center : the spectroscopic binary plus any other companion(s ) .",
    "if the central binary and disk are co - planar , @xcite showed that the disk - based dynamical mass estimate was consistent with that inferred from spectroscopic monitoring of the stellar orbits @xcite .",

    "however , x - ray photoevaporation ( and perhaps even euv / fuv photoevaporation ) might find a natural role in explaining the depletion of material inside the innermost dust ring ( @xmath206au inferred from the sed , see  [ sec : model1 ] ) .",
    "perhaps the greatest mystery surrounding the v4046 sgr disk is its existence : most theoretical and observational work suggests that disk dispersal processes should substantially diminish the observational signatures studied here well within the lifetime of this system and the few others like it @xcite .",
    "the modeling analysis conducted here unfortunately is unable to directly answer the question of why this gas - rich disk persists even at an age of 10 - 20myr .",
    "however , the inferred disk structure might be providing some clues . it might be possible that the cavity was formed early in the disk lifetime , stifling the viscous evolution process by severely limiting the gas accretion flow onto the central stars , and thereby slowing the natural evolution of the disk material .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that the tidal torque induced by a close binary on its disk may inhibit accretion and increase the lifetime of the circumbinary disk compared to that of a disk around a single star .",
    "such scenarios are speculative : but it is interesting to note that most ( if not all ) of the known long - lived , gas - rich disks have evidence for low - density cavities at their centers .    overall , the signatures of evolution in the transition disk hosted by v4046 sgr are remarkable , suggesting that this target merits a focused effort moving forward with alma .",
    "its close proximity and large physical size enables high resolution and high sensitivity observations .",

    "<S> we present sensitive , sub - arcsecond resolution submillimeter array observations of the protoplanetary disk around the nearby , pre - main sequence spectroscopic binary v4046 sgr . </S>",
    "<S> we report for the first time a large inner hole ( @xmath0au ) spatially resolved in the 1.3 mm continuum emission and study the structure of this disk using radiative transfer calculations to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , continuum visibilities , and spectral line emission of co and its main isotopologues . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling scheme demonstrates that the majority of the dust mass is distributed in a narrow ring ( centered at 37au with a fwhm of 16au ) that is @xmath15@xmath2 more compact than the gas disk . </S>",
    "<S> this structure implies that the dust - to - gas mass ratio has a strong spatial variation , ranging from a value much larger than typical of the interstellar medium ( ism ) at the ring to much smaller than that of the ism at larger disk radii . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that these basic structural features are potentially observational signatures of the accumulation of solids at a local gas pressure maximum </S>",
    "<S> . these models also require a substantial population of @xmath1@xmath3m - sized grains inside the central disk cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this structure is likely the result of dynamical interactions with a low - mass companion , although photoevaporation may also play a secondary role . </S>"
