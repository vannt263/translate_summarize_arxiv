    "despite recent advances @xcite in the analysis of complex networks , a number of areas of investigation concerned with the description , prediction , and control of the dynamics of a variety of systems , including weather networks@xcite , social networks@xcite , and the brain@xcite , still remain largely unexplored .",
    "a large number of these systems can not be properly understood unless they are regarded as components of higher - level systems in which various networks are connected with one another through a complex pattern of interdependencies  @xcite .",
    "these higher - level systems can thus be seen as networks in which the interacting nodes are networks themselves that are characterized by their own structure and function , and co - evolve over time according to various patterns .",
    "examples of such networks of networks include multimodal transportation networks , social networks , climatic systems , economic markets , energy ",
    "supply networks , and the human brain .",
    "for instance , the same individuals , groups and organizations can play different roles within a social relationship or can be linked through different types of social relationships ( e.g. , family relationships , acquaintanceship , friendship , and professional collaboration )  @xcite , can have different affiliations @xcite , and can communicate with one another using different technologies , such as mobile phone , chat , e - mail , or video conferences @xcite .",
    "each of these roles , relationships , affiliations , and communication technologies can in turn be associated with a different social network in which links between nodes refer to a distinct form of social interaction between the connected nodes .",
    "the same people , groups or organizations that interact in many different ways can thus be represented as the nodes of multiple co - evolving social networks that are themselves connected with one another as the various forms of social interaction affect one another over time  @xcite . despite the ubiquity of these co - evolving and interconnected forms of interaction , so far network scientists have focused primarily on network datasets that contain only one type of social relation , thus neglecting the complexity of the connections between the various networks in which the same people interact . to uncover the nature and full breadth of social interaction , a special emphasis",
    "should be placed precisely on the structure and dynamics of the network of interacting social networks .",
    "the system in which the same nodes belong to multiple interacting and co - evolving networks is typically referred to as a multiplex network or multigraph  @xcite . in recent literature , there has been an upsurge of interest in multiplex networks . in particular ,",
    "scholars have concentrated on the structural properties  @xcite and the antecedents @xcite of these networks , have shed light on diffusion processes  @xcite , cooperation @xcite , exchange relations @xcite , percolation phase transitions  @xcite , cascades@xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite , and election processes @xcite occurring on them , and have developed modeling frameworks  @xcite and game - theoretic perspectives  @xcite . among the structural properties of multiplex networks that scholars have only recently begun to address @xcite , a crucial role is played by the centrality of nodes . in a multiplex network ,",
    "the importance of a node depends on the connectivity patterns within and across the different layers of the network . for univariate networks in which no more than one link can connect the same pairs of nodes , a number of measures are available for assessing the importance of nodes .",
    "over recent years these measures have become increasingly popular and salient for a variety of empirical domains . among these measures , in this paper we concentrate our attention on pagerank , a centrality measure that has been successfully used not only for ranking web pages  @xcite , but also for ranking scientists in citation networks  @xcite or species in food webs  @xcite . while pagerank was originally proposed as a centrality measure for univariate networks  @xcite , its extension to multiplex networks remains largely unexplored . in particular , when the same pairs of nodes can be connected through multiple links co - evolving in multiple layers , a non - trivial problem is concerned with how to extend pagerank so as to capture the degree to which the ranking of nodes in one layer can affect , and be affected by , the ranking of the same nodes in other layers .",
    "this paper attempts to address this problem by proposing a generalization of pagerank to the case of multiplex networks .    to evaluate the relative popularity of a node in a network , pagerank centrality draws on the idea of a web surfer that visits different parts of the www at random .",
    "the random walker follows two strategies : the first is to jump to a node selected uniformly at random ; the second is to jump , still randomly , to one of the walker s neighbors .",
    "the popularity of a node is a function of the frequency with which the random walker visits the node .",
    "this frequency is then compared with the frequencies associated with all other nodes in the network .",
    "the ranking of nodes obtained according to these frequencies of being visited is precisely the ordering produced by the pagerank centrality measure , and reflects the relative popularity that each node has across the whole network .    to extend the pagerank centrality measure to the case of multiplex networks",
    ", we assume that the centrality a node has in one layer affects the centrality the node can obtain in another layer .",
    "this interplay between layers has a two - fold nature .",
    "first , the importance of a node in one layer may simply contribute to an increase in the node s importance in another layer .",
    "second , a node s importance in one layer can amplify the node s ability to derive benefits from the importance of other nodes that point to it in another layer .",
    "alternatively , from the perspective of a biased random walk on complex networks , multiplex pagerank can be described in terms of the bias that one layer exerts on the random jumps that a surfer makes in another layer @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we identify four versions of the multiplex pagerank centrality measure , depending on how layers affect each other or , alternatively , exert a bias upon the random jump .",
    "first , if the bias lies in the jump the random walker makes to any other node in the network , we obtain a measure that we call _ additive _ multiplex pagerank .",
    "second , if the bias is exerted upon the jump the walker makes to any of its neighboring nodes , we obtain the _ multiplicative _ multiplex pagerank .",
    "the third variant is motivated by the fact that it is possible to have a bias in both jumps . in this case",
    ", we obtain the _ combined _ multiplex pagerank . finally",
    "neutral _ multiplex pagerank refers to the case in which there is no bias in either jump , and thus the measure reduces to pagerank based on one single layer . for uncorrelated networks ,",
    "we show how these centrality measures are correlated with the structural properties of the networks .",
    "to clarify the meaning of the four versions of multiplex pagerank , we apply these measures to a multiplex network formed by the juxtaposition of two networks , and show that the centrality of a node in one network depends on the centrality of the same node in the other network .",
    "our application is concerned with online communication and is based on a multiplex network in which the same users can interact by sending instant messages to one another and by posting messages to a forum . as users can send messages directly to one another and at the same time participate in discussion groups within a forum , they can be regarded as embedded in two related online social networks .",
    "our results show that the multiplicative multiplex pagerank of users displays a broad distribution , and is thus able to capture the emergence of high - ranked nodes , unlike what can be obtained through the application of the pagerank centrality measure to a single network .",
    "introduced as a centrality measure for assessing the `` importance '' of web pages , the pagerank @xmath0 of a node @xmath1 in a network with @xmath2 nodes is defined as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the elements of the adjacency matrix that are equal to one if node @xmath5 points to node @xmath1 and zero otherwise , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is called the damping factor .",
    "pagerank can be interpreted as the stationary distribution of a random walk with additional random jumps .",
    "a random walker on site @xmath5 jumps to one of @xmath5 s @xmath8 out - neighbors with probability @xmath9 , and to any other site chosen uniformly at random with probability @xmath10 .",
    "the pagerank of a node is large to the extent that many other nodes point to it .",
    "the pagerank of a node is therefore expected to increase as a function of the node s in - degree , and indeed in @xcite it was shown that , for uncorrelated networks , the pagerank of nodes can be approximated by their in - degree . if nodes in uncorrelated networks are grouped into classes depending on their extended degrees @xmath11 , then the average pagerank for nodes of degree - class @xmath12 is @xmath13 where the symbol @xmath14 indicates the average over the @xmath2 nodes of the network .",
    "pagerank was originally proposed for ranking web pages in response to text queries , and for this reason it was formalized as a centrality measure for directed networks  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , possible to extend the original definition to the case of undirected networks . for these networks , pagerank is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the degree of node @xmath5 . for undirected networks ,",
    "the average pagerank @xmath18 of a node with degree @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    compared to univariate networks , multiplex networks enable nodes to be connected with one another through more than one type of links , and as such offer a richer and more detailed backdrop against which the structural position of nodes can be assessed .",
    "the extension of pagerank to multiplex networks is therefore expected to shed light on novel ways for measuring the importance of nodes that capture their embeddedness in multiple interrelated relations .",
    "a ranking of nodes can thus be obtained that is likely to differ from the one originating simply from the position of nodes in one single network .",
    "here we offer a generalization and extension of the pagerank measure that can be applied to any multiplex network dataset .",
    "the assumption underlying our proposed measure is that the centrality of a node in one network can be affected by the centrality of the same node in another network . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider the case in which the multiplex network is organized into two layers : network a and network b. our analysis can easily be generalized to multiplex networks with more than two layers ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we indicate with @xmath4 the elements of the adjacency matrix of network a , and with @xmath21 the elements of the adjacency matrix of network b. for network a , we evaluate pagerank @xmath22 using eq .",
    "( [ pagerank ] ) with the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we then express the _ multiplex pagerank centrality _",
    "@xmath23 of the nodes in network b with respect to pagerank @xmath24 .",
    "formally , we define the multiplex pagerank centrality @xmath25 of node @xmath1 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the kronecker delta , @xmath29 is small enough to guarantee that the relation can be satisfied , and the exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both greater than or equal to zero . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ pagerankx ] ) refers to the contribution to node @xmath1 s centrality that derives from the centrality of the nodes pointing to @xmath1 in network b. like with the ordinary pagerank measure , this contribution is inversely proportional to the out - degree of node @xmath1 s in - neighbors .",
    "however , unlike the ordinary measure , eq .  ( [ pagerankx ] ) enables this contribution to be also affected by the centrality that both node @xmath1 and its in - neighbors in network b have in network a. this interplay between the two networks has a two - fold effect on a node s centrality .",
    "first , the extent to which node @xmath1 can derive some advantage from the centrality of its in - neighbors in network b becomes more significant as the centrality of @xmath1 in network a becomes larger .",
    "the more prominent a node is in one layer , the more likely it is that the node can attract and gain benefit from other important nodes in another layer .",
    "second , the contribution of each in - neighbor @xmath5 to @xmath1 s centrality in network b is discounted by dividing @xmath5 s centrality by the sum of the centralities that @xmath5 s out - neighbors in network b have in network a. in other words , the benefits node @xmath1 can derive from the centrality of any in - neighbor @xmath5 in network b are diluted to the extent that @xmath5 in network b points to many other nodes that are associated with high centrality in network a. an important node in one layer can attract important nodes in a different layer , but the benefit that can be gained in so doing are mitigated if there are many other nodes that have a similar capacity of attraction .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ pagerankx ] ) reflects the contribution to node @xmath1 s centrality in network b that derives from @xmath1 s centrality in network a. by adding this second term , nodes that are not able to attract important neighbors in network b , can still derive some advantage simply by being central in network a. in the extreme case , a node with a zero in - degree in network b can still be associated with a non - zero value of centrality",
    "if the node has a non - zero centrality in network a. the assumption underlying this component of centrality is that the importance of a node in one layer is positively affected by the importance that the same node has in another layer , regardless of the node s capacity to attract other important nodes in the former layer .",
    "alternatively , multiplex pagerank can also be regarded as the stationary distribution of a random walk with additional biased jumps . with probability @xmath32 , a random walker on site @xmath5 jumps to site @xmath1 , one of @xmath5 s @xmath8 out  neighbors",
    "selected with probability proportional to @xmath33 , and with probability @xmath34 jumps to site @xmath1 chosen with probability proportional to @xmath35 .    in what follows ,",
    "we identify four important limiting cases of the multiplex pagerank measure :    * _ additive multiplex pagerank ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) _ :",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "this refers to the case in which the effect of network a on network b is exerted simply by `` adding '' some value to the centrality the nodes have in network b in proportion to the centrality they have in network a. here the interplay between networks does not imply that the importance a node has in one network affects the node s ability to derive benefits from important nodes in another network .",
    "simply , being central in network a enables a node to gain more centrality in network b , regardless of the node s capacity to attract important others in network b. recast in terms of a random walk , this version of multiplex pagerank refers to the case of a biased random walk , where the bias lies in the random jump to any node in network b. in particular , nodes with high pagerank in network a are preferred over other nodes with low pagerank in the same network as the destination of the random jumps that the walker makes in network b. a similar version of this pagerank measure , in which the random jumps are biased according to some predetermined distribution called  personalized vector \" , has already been suggested in the computer science literature @xcite . in qualitative agreement with this version , here",

    "this refers to the case in which the effect of network a on network b lies in `` multiplying '' the benefits that a node gains from the importance of its in - neighbors in network b by a factor that is proportional to the node s importance in network a. thus , all benefits that can be obtained by being central in network a are contingent upon the connections that a node receives from important nodes in network b. the more important a node is in network a , the more value the node can extract from the connections received from important others in network b. unlike the additive version , the multiplicative multiplex pagerank does not enable a node to derive any added benefit in network b by simply being important in network a , regardless of the importance of the node s in - neighbors in network b. alternatively , this version of the measure also refers to the case of a biased random walk , where the bias lies in the walker s choice of the out  neighbor as the destination of the jump . in particular , neighbors with high pagerank in network a are preferred over other neighbors with low pagerank in the same network . * _ combined multiplex pagerank ( @xmath44 ) _ : @xmath45 where @xmath43 .",

    "alternatively , this version of multiplex pagerank refers to the case in which both the destination of the random jump and the selection of the random walker s out - neighbor in network b are biased in that they favor nodes with high pagerank in network a over nodes with low pagerank in the same network .",

    "<S> many complex systems can be described as multiplex networks in which the same nodes can interact with one another in different layers , thus forming a set of interacting and co - evolving networks . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such multiplex systems are social networks where people are involved in different types of relationships and interact through various forms of communication media . </S>",
    "<S> the ranking of nodes in multiplex networks is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks that research on complex networks is currently facing . </S>",
    "<S> when pairs of nodes can be connected through multiple links and in multiple layers , the ranking of nodes should necessarily reflect the importance of nodes in one layer as well as their importance in other interdependent layers . in this paper , we draw on the idea of biased random walks to define the multiplex pagerank centrality measure in which the effects of the interplay between networks on the centrality of nodes are directly taken into account . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> depending on the intensity of the interaction between layers , we define the additive , multiplicative , combined , and neutral versions of multiplex pagerank , and show how each version reflects the extent to which the importance of a node in one layer affects the importance the node can gain in another layer . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these measures and apply them to an online multiplex social network . </S>",
    "<S> findings indicate that taking the multiplex nature of the network into account helps uncover the emergence of rankings of nodes that differ from the rankings obtained from one single layer . </S>",
    "<S> results provide support in favor of the salience of multiplex centrality measures , like multiplex pagerank , for assessing the prominence of nodes embedded in multiple interacting networks , and for shedding a new light on structural properties that would otherwise remain undetected if each of the interacting networks were analyzed in isolation . </S>"
