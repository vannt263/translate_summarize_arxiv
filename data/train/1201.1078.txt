    "correlations are an essential feature of an interacting many - body system such as nuclear matter .",
    "they have an impact on the thermodynamical properties and the composition of the matter since the constituent particles can form new nuclear species as bound states .",
    "this aspect is particularly important in the description of matter below nuclear saturation density that is employed in theoretical simulations of astrophysical phenomena such as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "there , the knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - proton asymmetric matter is required in a wide range of densities and temperatures @xcite .",
    "the description of dense matter is important for the investigation of various stages in supernova explosions and the structure of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is known to affect the effectiveness of the neutrino reheating of the shock wave @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the collapse dynamics on the properties of matter and the composition in this density regime could strongly influence the structure of the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "although there are many approaches to describe dense matter , in particular at zero temperature , only few models cover the full parameter space needed in most astrophysical applications .",
    "often , they do not supply sufficient information on the thermodynamical and compositional details .",
    "thus , for many years , a very small number of eos tables was available which have been used in simulations of dynamical astrophysical processes @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years , the interest in developing eos has surged and several new eos tables were provided @xcite .",
    "this development was triggered by the needs of astrophysical modelers , the progress in the theoretical description of nuclear matter and an increase of computational power .",
    "nevertheless , approximations and simplifications are still needed for practical purposes .",
    "there are two major paths to build an eos of warm and dense nuclear matter for practical applications .",
    "one approach starts with an ideal mixture of nucleons and nuclei leading to a nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) description @xcite .",
    "the effect of interactions between all constituents can be incorporated with the help of virial corrections . however , at present , only nucleons and light nuclei are considered in practice in such a virial equation of state ( veos ) @xcite that provides the correct finite - temperature eos in the limit of very low densities .",
    "the results are model independent since they depend only on experimentally determined data , i.e.  binding energies of nuclei and scattering phase shifts .",
    "unfortunately , the application of this approach is limited to rather low densities .",
    "the dissolution of nuclei and the transition to uniform neutron - proton matter with increasing density can not be described properly . in order to simulate such an effect ,",
    "the heuristic excluded volume mechanism was employed frequently @xcite .",
    "a second class of eos models for astrophysical applications is based on self - consistent mean - field methods with neutrons and protons as fundamental constituents .",
    "they are considered as quasiparticles with self - energies that contain the information on the interaction which is usually modeled in an effective way and not taken from a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction .",
    "these mean - field models , both non - relativistic and relativistic , can be very successful in describing finite nuclei and nuclear matter around saturation density @xmath0  fm @xcite .",
    "but at low densities @xmath1 they fail to include correlations properly that give rise to inhomogeneities and the formation of many - body bound states , i.e.  nuclei .",
    "there were attempts to modify the low - density behavior of mean - field models guided by microscopic calculations , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the zero temperature case .",
    "however , it is still challenging to include the formation of clusters properly .",
    "the deficiencies of the various models lead to the strategy of patching up or merging different approaches providing a uniform description of warm dense matter .",
    "a recent publication @xcite considered a quantum statistical approach to nuclear matter and devised a generalized relativistic mean - field ( grmf ) model , which is an extension of the relativistic mean - field model with density dependent couplings ( dd - rmf ) from ref .",
    "the grmf model includes , besides nucleons , light nuclei ( @xmath2h@xmath3 , @xmath4h@xmath5 , @xmath4he@xmath6 , @xmath7he@xmath8 ) as hadronic degrees of freedom in the lagrangian .",
    "the dissolution of these clusters is modeled by a medium - dependent shift of their binding energies originating mainly from the action of the pauli principle .",
    "all hadronic constituents of the model can be viewed as quasiparticles that interact via the exchange of effective mesons .",
    "the grmf model achieves bridging the two views on nuclear matter , i.e.  a mixture of nucleon and nuclei at low densities and nucleons as quasiparticles moving in mean fields at high densities .",
    "even though the model contains the same relevant particles at low densities as the veos , it does not reproduce exactly the thermodynamical properties of the veos as will be shown below .",
    "in fact , all presently employed eos for astrophysical applications that are based on mean - field concepts share the problem of reproducing the veos in the low - density limit .",
    "thus the question arises , how the models can be modified in order to approach the correct low - density limit .",
    "is a modification of the effective interaction sufficient to meet this aim or are there more severe changes of the models required ?    in this work",
    "we propose an approach that introduces bound and scattering states in an effective way as additional degrees of freedom in the thermodynamical potential .",
    "all relevant quantities are derived in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "these many - body bound and scattering states are represented by quasiparticles with medium - dependent properties and temperature dependent energies .",
    "the low - density behavior of nuclear matter at finite temperatures is considered in detail by comparing the veos with the grmf approach by means of a series expansion of the grand canonical potential in powers of the nucleon fugacities . from the comparison of the veos and grmf expansions we will derive consistency relations that connect quasiparticle properties with the meson - nucleon couplings in the vacuum and the phase shifts or effective - range parameters of nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "we investigate different choices of the meson - nucleon couplings and quasiparticle properties set by these consistency relations .",
    "in addition , relativistic corrections to the traditional veos are obtained from these relations that become larger than the effects of particle correlations in the low - density limit .",
    "various parametrizations of the quasiparticle medium dependence are discussed .",
    "studying thermodynamical properties of the matter we consider temperatures higher than the critical temperatures for pairing and bose condensation in order to avoid these more complex effects .",
    "thus our consideration of the low and zero temperature limits should be corrected in the future to incorporate condensation phenomena .",
    "our approach is not limited to the chosen particular grmf model with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "it can be applied easily to other mean - field approaches as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : veos ] we present a general formulation of the veos that serves as one starting point of the discussion .",
    "basic quantities are defined and the notation is established .",
    "we show that correlations in continuum states can be represented effectively by temperature dependent resonances .",
