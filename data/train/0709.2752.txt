    "there has been considerable recent interest in the statistical , topological , and dynamical properties of complex networks , important examples of which include the well - known scale - free and small - world networks ( sfns and swns ) .",
    "justification for this interest stems from the increasing use of complex network theory to the understanding of a wide variety of phenomena in the social , biological , and physical sciences , a small sample of which include collaboration and acquaintance networks , protein interactions in the cell , power grids , entangled polymers , and information and communication networks @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ongoing interest in static topological properties of such complex , generally disordered structures , there has been a parallel interest in various _",
    "dynamical _ processes defined on them , and on how such processes differ from those that take place on ordered networks and regular lattices ( rls ) sca01,pan01,lah01,alm03,blu , noh04,yan05,cos07,bo , derek , par05,can07,kor07 .    in particular ,",
    "a recent contribution to the study of random walks on newman - watts swns , which are structures formed by superimposing a classical random graph of randomly distributed links onto the sites of an ordered regular lattice @xcite , is a variation introduced by parris and kenkre @xcite in which the random walk proceeds in continuous rather than discrete time , and the jump rate @xmath1 for steps across the random shortcuts is different from the rate @xmath2for steps across regular lattice bonds .",
    "such a modification has two primary advantages .",
    "first , it allows the strength of the regular and random graph components of the network to be independently adjusted ( or even turned off ) at fixed shortcut density by simply varying the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "second , it allows for the rational evaluation of schemes for upgrading or optimizing access times in existing information or communication networks , e.g. , by randomly incorporating a relatively small number of newer , faster connections into an existing network already possessing a large number of older , perhaps slower , ones .",
    "the analysis of ref .  @xcite focused on the network _",
    "traversal time _",
    "@xmath4 , defined as the mean first - passage time required by a random walker initially at site @xmath5 to reach the site at @xmath6 farthest from where it started on the regular 1d lattice backbone ( formed into a ring of @xmath7 nodes ) , averaged over initial sites and network realizations .",
    "that study revealed an interesting collapse of traversal time data onto a universal curve for fast shortcuts @xmath8 and low shortcut densities @xmath9 defined as the ratio of the number @xmath10 of small - world shortcuts to the total number @xmath7 of sites ( or nodes ) in the system .",
    "this ratio @xmath11 is equal to twice the average _ shortcut vertex degree _ @xmath12",
    "the present paper explores a question that has naturally arisen from an extension @xcite of the work of ref .",
    "@xcite on swns to the study of random walks on hybrid structures formed by superimposing _ scale - free _ shortcut networks onto regular lattices , carried out recently considering more general _ access times _",
    "@xmath13 for a walker to reach a location @xmath14 nodes away from where it started .",
    "one conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite was that , at fixed shortcut degree @xmath15 and shortcut speed @xmath16 sfn - rl hybrids are always less efficient at reducing the mean traversal time @xmath17 and result in more dispersion in the distribution of access times across the network , than their swn counterparts .",
    "this conclusion , which simply reflects the more inhomogeneous nature of local environments in sfns relative to swns , raises the question as to whether there exist other random structures whose embedding would generally enhance network traversal and access times more efficiently than swns .    to explore this question , we consider a new class of partially - ordered random structures that are generally more ordered than the swns studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and that we generically refer to as _ traversal enhanced networks _ ( tens ) .",
    "motivation for the development of such structures arises from the intuition that a walker s ability to traverse the system is not efficiently enhanced by shortcuts between nodes that are already close together . indeed , in a given swn system , if some of the shorter random links could be redirected into nodes farther away , the mean traversal and access times for the entire structure would presumably decrease without changing the total number of shortcuts .",
    "we consider here , therefore , random walks on a 1d ring of @xmath7 nodes connected by nearest - neighbor hopping rate @xmath18 and associate with each possible link between two nodes separated by a backbone distance @xmath19 an _ a priori _ shortcut connection probability @xmath20 with @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 two nodes separated by a particular backbone span @xmath24 are connected by a hopping rate @xmath1 with probability @xmath25 and are left unconnected with probability @xmath26 .",
    "the swn hybrids previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite are seen to be limiting cases of such a network with _",
    "equal _ connection probabilities @xmath27 . to optimize network traversal times , or times for access to an arbitrary site , on the other hand , tens allow for the possibility of increasing connection probabilities @xmath28 for large @xmath29 relative to those for small @xmath30 keeping fixed the total average shortcut degree @xmath15 .",
    "the general theory that we develop in this paper allows for the study of partially ordered networks with an arbitrary shortcut connection probability distribution @xmath28 . for purposes of comparison with simulation , however , the main results of the present paper are applied to a specific subclass of such structures for which @xmath31 i.e. , for which shortcuts of a single span @xmath32 are randomly added . as might be expected , adding shortcuts of length @xmath32 dramatically decreases access times for pairs of sites separated by that distance .",
    "perhaps less intuitively , however , we also find that the _ average _ access time to any point on the network fluctuates rapidly with @xmath32 , and depends , in particular , on whether shortcut lengths are commensurable with the 1d ring to which the shortcuts are added .",
    "indeed , the obvious limiting case with @xmath33 is found to maximally enhance the network _ traversal _",
    "time , but is associated with the largest average access time , over all such networks with fixed average shortcut degree @xmath15 .    the rest of the paper is laid out as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the master equation governing the evolution of the probabilities @xmath34 for the walker to be at a given site on such a network at time @xmath35 . for each network ,",
    "the master equation can in principle be solved numerically in either the time or frequency ( laplace ) domain , and the results averaged over an appropriate ensemble of networks to obtain observable quantities of interest .",
    "this becomes increasingly difficult for large @xmath7 due to the size of the random matrices that must be manipulated in the process .",
    "equivalent results can be obtained by performing monte carlo simulations that follow the trajectory of individual walkers , using the assigned transition probabilities to determine a specific random sequence of steps and transition times .",
    "simulation results must then be doubly averaged , first over a sufficient number of walks , and then over an appropriate ensemble of networks . a useful _ fixed jump time _",
    "simulation technique for computing mean traversal and access times for the underlying _ continuous _ time random walk is described in sec .",
    "ii for this purpose .",
    "the averaging process underscores the point that one is interested in statistical properties of the ensemble of networks associated with a particular set of connection probabilities @xmath36 which for large enough networks should be representative of typical properties associated with any given realization .",
    "section iii presents an analytic approach to the problem with the construction of an approximate , but numerically accurate , effective medium theory ( emt ) for describing the evolution of the ensemble averaged probabilities @xmath37 from which the mean traversal times can be easily and quickly computed , even for very large networks . in sec .",
    "iv we present and discuss the main numerical ( monte carlo ) results of the paper , comparing them in each case with the predictions of our analytic effective medium theory ; we find them to be generally in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "the last section of the paper contains a summary .",
    "as is clear from the introduction , we are interested in random walks in continuous time as described by the master equation @xmath38where on the ring it is understood that @xmath39 and the second sum in the first line includes all values @xmath40 but excludes nearest - neighbors ( @xmath41 is assumed even ) .",
    "the transition rate @xmath42 between node @xmath43 and node @xmath44 is a random variable equal to @xmath1 with probability @xmath28 and to zero with probability @xmath45 in the second line we have expressed the linear relation on the right - hand side in terms of the transition matrix @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , the solution to the master equation can be numerically obtained through an evaluation of the exponential of this matrix . specifically , the probability to find the walker at node @xmath14 at time @xmath47 given that it started at node @xmath5 at @xmath48 is the green s function or propagator @xcite@xmath49 _ { n , m}.\\]]the functions @xmath50 , or their laplace transforms @xmath51 _ { m , n }   \\label{gnm}\\]]are readily computed for moderately sized systems @xmath52 using standard numerical techniques , but computation times and storage requirements can grow significantly with system size @xmath7 .",
    "information about traversal and access times is straightforwardly obtainable from the green s functions or their laplace transforms , eq .",
    "( [ gnm ] ) .",
    "for example , the mean first passage time @xmath53 for a walker to arrive at node @xmath14 given that it started at @xmath5 is computable through the expression @xcite@xmath54 .",
    "\\label{taufpt}\\]]in this way , general traversal and access times are readily computed from the resolvent of the matrix @xmath55 for small values of the laplace variable @xmath56 ; a full solution of the problem requires only the operation of matrix inversion .",
    "= 3.5truein    on the other hand , the full solution to the master equation contains more information than is really necessary for computing mean access times .",
    "it is also possible to simply perform a monte carlo simulation @xcite that follows individual trajectories along an ensemble of random walks , with steps and dwell times governed by the transition probabilities assigned to a given network .",
    "jump destinations of the random walker are chosen at each time step from the local transition probabilities at the site occupied by the walker , by means of pseudo- random variables ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , a walker located at a given site on the network with shortcut degree @xmath57 will make a transition to one of its two neighbors on the ordered ring with probability @xmath58 , will make a transition to one of the @xmath57 sites to which it is connected by a shortcut with probability @xmath59 , and will stay at its present position with probability @xmath60 . after performing @xmath61 monte carlo steps",
    ", the corresponding continuous time elapsed is @xmath62 .",
    "as we show in the appendix , as long as we are interested only in computing mean first passage times ( and not the probabilities themselves , or other observables ) , the choice of the fixed jump time @xmath63 is arbitrary , provided all transition probabilities remain positive definite ( i.e. , provided @xmath64 .",
    "in the appendix we prove , specifically , that this method ( when averaged over a large enough ensemble of random walks ) reproduces the mean access times of the master equation .",
    "the mean access time @xmath65 for a given network configuration , is then computed as the average of this quantity over random walks on the same network , and then over a sufficiently large ensemble of networks characterized by the same set of network parameters . except where explicitly noted ,",
    "simulation results shown in the present paper were obtained for networks of size @xmath66 , typically averaged over 100 different network configurations and 1000 different random walk trajectories per configuration .",
    "specific simulation results appear in figs .",
    "1]-[fig . 8 ] , together with predictions of the effective medium theory derived in the next section .",
    "in this section we derive analytical expressions that define an effective medium theory ( emt ) for the configuration averaged probabilities , or green s functions @xmath67that describe transport on the very general class of structures described in the introduction",
    ". we also specialize it to the analysis of partially - ordered networks having a sharp distribution of link lengths , in which form it becomes very simple to implement . as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ emag ] ) above , the key simplification that arises in emt is that _ average _ transport properties of the ensemble are translationally invariant . in the present context",
    ", we assume that the functions @xmath68 obey the equations@xmath69here , the @xmath70 are frequency- dependent rates , equivalently , memory functions in the laplace domain , connecting pairs of sites on the network separated by a distance @xmath71 .",
    "notice that , without loss of generality , we consider that the random walker s initial position is at @xmath72 . in the emt equations ,",
    "transport _ around _ the ring edge is characterized by the same rate @xmath0 that obtains throughout the ensemble , but the @xmath73 must be determined from self - consistent considerations .",
    "the _ simplest _",
    "( non - self - consistent ) approximation , i.e , @xmath74 , generally gives a very poor approximation to the dynamics , and is equivalent to an `` annealed model '' in which possible shortcut connections are determined anew at each step of the random walk @xcite , a situation very different from the actual `` quenched disorder '' model considered here , which has percolative possibilities lacking in an annealed model .",
    "note that once the effective medium parameters @xmath75 are determined , the rest of the problem is straightforward , since the translationally invariant set of equations ( ema me ) is easily solved by introducing discrete fourier transforms @xmath76 which diagonalize the emt transition matrix , and lead to the solution@xmath77 + \\sum_{n=2,\\frac{n}{2}-1}\\tilde{w}_{n}\\left ( \\varepsilon \\right ) \\left [ 1-\\cos \\left ( kn\\right ) \\right ] }   \\label{ksum}\\]]where the outer sum is over all wavevectors @xmath78 with @xmath79 where in the denominator we have separated out the single @xmath80 term , for which there is only one link , and where in the other terms ( with @xmath81 ) contributions from both links of a given length have been combined together . from these effective medium propagators",
    "it is also straightforward to evaluate access times .",
    "indeed , analysis of the propagators ( [ ksum ] ) reveals that the mean access times ( [ taufpt ] ) in the effective medium can be simply calculated @xmath82 = n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{m}\\left ( 0\\right ) \\label{taugamma}\\]]directly from the zero frequency value of the propagator difference @xmath83    = 3.5truein    to determine the function @xmath70 self - consistently , we imagine that we have already performed the average over all links _ except _ the one connecting the origin to the site @xmath5 nodes away , so that the resulting equations of motion are not the completely averaged emt equations ( [ ema me ] ) , but are , instead , of the form@xmath84where @xmath85 is an actual rate ( @xmath1 or @xmath86 ) drawn from the distribution governing it . for a given value of @xmath85 the solution to this defect problem can be formally written in terms of the propagators @xmath87 for the effective medium .",
    "for example , the laplace transformed probability to find the walker at the origin can be expressed in terms of the emt quantities @xmath88 in ( [ gamma ] ) through the relation@xmath89averaging this over the binary distribution associated with this one remaining link must now generate the _ completely _ averaged effective medium , i.e. , we self - consistently demand that @xmath90 hence the average of the second term on the right hand side of this last equation must vanish .",
    "repeating for each node @xmath91 gives the following set of self - consistent conditions@xmath92which are equivalent to the relations @xmath93 by ( e.g. , numerically ) solving this set of simultaneous equations at each value of @xmath94 the set of functions @xmath95 can be determined , and the results used to evaluate the effective medium propagators , and thus the traversal and access times .",
    "note that , in general , an analytic solution is not available since the functions @xmath96 themselves depend in a complicated way on the complete set of effective medium parameters @xmath97 through ( [ ksum ] ) and ( gamma ) .",
    "note also that in the swn hybrids studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath98 for all shortcuts , and where a single effective medium parameter @xmath99 was assumed , the value of @xmath100 was identified as the root of the equation @xmath101obtained by summing ( or averaging ) each of the equations ( [ scone ] ) . in the present context , we anticipate generally having to simultaneously solve the set of @xmath102 equations ( [ scone ] ) for the corresponding number of effective medium parameters @xmath103    of course , in situations in which @xmath104 the vanishing of the left hand side of ( [ scone ] ) leads to a vanishing of the associated effective medium rate @xmath70 as well , and hence a reduction in the number of coupled equations that must be solved .",
    "thus , in the simplest such network , for which @xmath105 and in which only shortcuts of a single fixed length @xmath32 are added to the ring , the set reduces to one equation for determining the single non - zero effective medium parameter @xmath106 which is easily determined numerically , and from which the corresponding access times can then be calculated using ( [ taugamma ] ) . in the next section we present the results of monte carlo simulations on such networks along with the corresponding predictions of the effective medium theory derived above .",
    "in fig .  [ fig . 1 ] we show the mean traversal time @xmath4 ( normalized to the mean hopping time @xmath107 for hops around the edge of the ring ) as a function of the mean shortcut degree @xmath15 on a ten of @xmath66 sites with links of maximal length @xmath108 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "open symbols are the results of simulation , the solid curves running near or through them are the predictions of emt .",
    "as expected , the mean traversal time decreases monotonically as the mean degree of the network increases , since a larger density of shortcuts naturally shortens the time needed to cross the network .",
    "the decrease in traversal time is modest for small values of the ratio @xmath3 , but becomes quite large for @xmath109 and for shortcut densities close to the maximum value , which for this network occurs when the mean shortcut vertex degree @xmath110 .",
    "the decrease seen in fig .",
    "1 ] is quite similar to that previously encountered in the swn case @xcite , where , for low shortcut densities and @xmath109 , the data were found to collapse onto a universal curve , while , for higher shortcut densities near @xmath111 , traversal times scaled as @xmath112 . in this regime of the swn , as in the present case , by increasing the ratio @xmath3 the mean traversal time can be made arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the behavior seen in the swn and in the tens of fig .  [ fig .",
    "1 ] arise for a similar reason . in the limit @xmath113 ,",
    "the shortcut density is very low and the traversal time tends to the diffusive limit , where @xmath114 . even when @xmath8 , if @xmath113 , the shortcut connections are very sparse , and there will not be a substantial reduction in the traversal time , as the walker still spends most of its time on the slower steps it must take _ around _ the ring . in this regime , therefore , the traversal time is largely insensitive to the value of @xmath115 as long as it is large enough for the shortcuts not to be rate limiting .",
    "however , when the number of shortcuts approaches a threshold near @xmath111 , percolation of the underlying shortcut network leads to a change in the transport mechanism ; in this regime particles need few if any slow steps to get across the system , and can move mainly along the fast shortcut connections .    in order to further compare characteristic features of transport on different network structures",
    ", we also consider the distribution and spatial variation of access time @xmath116 for going from an arbitrary initial site to one located @xmath5 nodes away along the 1d backbone .",
    "figure  [ fig .",
    "2 ] shows access times @xmath116 as a function of node position @xmath5 for the @xmath117 ten at different shortcut densities in the range @xmath118 as indicated , and for different jump rate ratios : ( a ) @xmath119 , ( b ) @xmath120 , and ( c ) @xmath121 .",
    "again , open symbols indicate simulation results , and solid lines the predictions of the emt , which is generally quite good , except in a few cases where it tends to underestimate the access time . for small mean shortcut degrees , @xmath122 , access times",
    "grow monotonically with distance , as transport is dominated by diffusion along the regular lattice bonds . for denser networks on the other hand , one observes a local minimum taking place at @xmath123 , reflecting the traversal time enhancement that might be expected of the ten structure .    figures  [ fig .",
    "2](a)-(c ) show the effect of increasing the speed of shortcut connections . as expected , in the sparse network limit ( @xmath124 ) access times are essentially universal and are insensitive to shortcut speeds , while for denser networks access is enhanced dramatically around @xmath123 for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath121 ( see fig .   [ fig .",
    "2](c ) ) , an improvement of almost 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath125 is achieved by increasing the shortcut density from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "the improvement is dramatic , but _ not _ very democratic , and is largely confined to a region in the immediate vicinity of @xmath128 .    to highlight this point",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3 ] a comparison of access times for ten and swn structures , for @xmath127 and for different jump rate ratios @xmath3 , as indicated @xcite . in this figure",
    "we see a sharp contrast between access times in ten structures ( which clearly reflect their specific design goal of improving access to sites directly across the network ) and swn access time distributions , which are remarkably flat , and which , for the same number of links , do a better job of providing faster access times to _ most _ network nodes .",
    "further insights on the different transport properties of ten and swn structures can be gained by considering simple statistical properties of the access time distribution , such as the minimum , average , and maximum access times , defined by @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .    from our previous discussion regarding the results in fig .",
    "2 ] , it should be noted that , for tens in the parameter region @xmath111 and @xmath8 , the mean _ traversal _ time is actually the minimum access time for the network , i.e. @xmath132 . for swns , on the other hand , the mean and maximum access times are essentially the same , and well approximated by the traversal time : @xmath133 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 for tens and swns as a function of the rate ratio @xmath3 is shown in figure [ fig . 4 ] . as in fig .",
    "2 ] , we consider dense networks with @xmath137 . for both types of network , when @xmath138 the minimum access time @xmath139 corresponds to the time to arrive at one of its nearest neighbors .",
    "however , in the ten case a crossover takes place around @xmath140 to a regime in which @xmath134 corresponds to the traversal time for going all the way across the network .",
    "indeed , for @xmath141 it is observed that @xmath142 , reflecting the large traversal enhancement effect characteristic of tens in this parameter region .",
    "the differences among @xmath134 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are much less pronounced in the case of swns , which is again a manifestation of the nearly flat distribution of this type of network .    in order to investigate further the properties of ten structures , in particular , we now consider the case in which shortcut connections have lengths different from the ring s diameter @xmath145 . if we consider shortcuts connecting sites separated by a distance @xmath32 ( measured along the backbone ring in units of lattice bond length ) as straight rods or wires of length @xmath146 , then@xmath147    figure [ fig .",
    "5 ] shows access times for ten structures of @xmath66 sites with mean degree @xmath127 , and shortcuts of different length : ( a ) @xmath148 , ( b ) @xmath149 , and ( c ) @xmath150 . here",
    "the mean vertex degree is now one half the maximum value it can attain , since there are now two possible links of length @xmath32 connected to any given site . for these structures ,",
    "an interesting oscillatory pattern arises for @xmath8 , with a characteristic repeat length related to the shortcut length @xmath32 and to the commensurability of @xmath32 with the total number of sites in the ring .",
    "notice the similarity between the patterns for @xmath151 and @xmath152 , which presumably arises due to the fact that when one moves around the ring with steps of length @xmath153 the path closes after one circuit , and revisits the same set of 8 sites , separated by a distance @xmath32 , while with steps of length @xmath154 the path closes after two circuits , over which it visits the _",
    "same _ set of sites ( modulo @xmath155 )  as visited in one circuit with steps of length @xmath156 like the system in which @xmath157 , however , there are clearly significant regions of the network for which the speed - up in access time is not very significant .",
    "are such gaps inevitable ?",
    "perhaps not . in these examples",
    "the shortcut length is commensurate with the circumference of the ring .",
    "one might imagine , based upon the description above for @xmath154 that the periodic structure might be `` filled in '' , by choosing a step length that is highly incommensurate with the circumference of the ring .",
    "indeed , an investigation of this effect confirms that a slight alteration in the shortcut length can lead to dramatic changes in the spatial distribution of mean access times .",
    "we display this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig . 6 ] , where we show the mean access time distribution for four systems , consisting of two pairs with shortcut lengths that differ by a relatively small number of sites .",
    "the dramatic change in the shape , and the overall mean access time , suggests that the latter quantity is a strongly fluctuating function of the shortcut length @xmath32 for this class of networks . in figure",
    "7 ] we present a plot showing this strong variation of the mean access time of the entire network as a function of the shortcut length @xmath32 , for a fixed average number of shortcuts . in figs .",
    "6 ] and [ fig . 7 ] the solid lines are the result of the effective medium theory , the symbols the result of numerical simulation .",
    "effective medium theory does an excellent job capturing the highly fluctuating access time spectrum .",
    "the results show that in addition to speeding up access times to the specific sites connected by shortcuts of a given chosen length , a significant reduction in the overall access time is also possible , provided that the shortcut length is not commensurate with existing structures in the network to which the shortcuts are added .",
    "= 3.5truein    finally , as discussed in the introduction , one of the main interests of studying transport properties on different network topologies ( with the addition of shortcuts to an underlying ordered structure ) is aimed at optimizing access times and signal transmission across the network , where added shortcuts might represent fast , high quality connections ( @xmath8 ) . in this context , let us consider a comparison at fixed `` cost '' ( as represented by the total length of shortcut wires , i.e. @xmath158 ) and compare access times obtained on ten configurations for different values of @xmath159 . as an example , fig . [ fig .",
    "8 ] shows access times for two ten structures of size @xmath66 , where fast connections ( @xmath160 ) of length @xmath161 and @xmath162 are compared for corresponding values of the shortcut densities that keep @xmath163 fixed . from eq.([shlength ] ) and the condition of equal total length , it turns out that @xmath164 .",
    "one can see that the use of a large number of shorter connections is generally more effective in reducing access times to most of the network nodes , except for sites located in the immediate neighborhood of the region spanned by the longer connections .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the transport of walkers in a class of networks similar to the newman - watts small world networks on the basis of an effective medium theory .",
    "the primary motivation has been to study the effect of varying the shortcut distribution in a well - defined way .",
    "the intuition that replacing shorter links in a small world network with an equal number of longer ones might improve access times across the network is only _",
    "partially verified_. in keeping with straightforward intuition , it has been found that , if the goal is to simply improve access between nodes lying at specific distances , then randomly adding links of that length will indeed improve the specific subset of access times between nodes located at those distances , sometimes dramatically so . in cases where the shortcut lengths are commensurable with the underlying size of the system , this reduction in access times is not generally reflected in the access time of the network as a whole , with large regions of the network retaining surprisingly large access times . in situations",
    "where the shortcut length is highly incommensurate with the size of the system , however , the reduction in access times expected at distances associated with the shortcut length are also at least partially shared by most of the remaining sites on the network .",
    "presumably this would reflect the more typical behavior that one would expect in adding shortcuts of a fixed length to an already disordered structure .",
    "it also suggests a strategy for probing hidden structures in apparently disordered networks .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in this appendix we show how the numerical procedure described in the body of the article is able to correctly compute mean access and traversal times , using a time step @xmath63 that is chosen arbitrarily , provided the associated transition probabilities remain positive .",
    "we hasten to point out that if we were interested in numerically simulating ( or integrating ) the master equation ( [ me ] ) , such an approach would not work : for numerical accuracy the time step @xmath63 would have to be chosen much smaller than the smallest hopping time in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "when enough walks are employed the process described above does correctly compute mean access times .    to see this",
    ", we consider a walker that has just arrived at some site @xmath14 on the network .",
    "this site will have @xmath165 neighbors on the ring connected to it by transition rates @xmath0 , and @xmath166 shortcut sites to which it is connected with rates @xmath167 from the master equation it is well known , and straightforward to show , that a walker will leave such a site at a random time @xmath168 drawn from the exponential jump time probability distribution@xmath169when it does make a transition , the probability @xmath170 for it to go to one of the shortcut sites to which it is connected , and the probability @xmath171 for it to go to one of its two neighboring sites on the ring , are given by @xmath172 in the numerical procedure described in sec .",
    "ii , these branching ratios are preserved each time a jump occurs , as is easily verified .",
    "thus , each random walk _ path _ generated by our numerical procedure has the same statistical weight as it would if governed by the exact jump time distribution given above .",
    "it suffices therefore to consider the ensemble of random walks that take place _ on any given random walk path _ , and to show that our numerical procedure correctly predicts the correct average duration of walks occuring on such a path . if the initial site and final site of such a path are taken to be the ones whose access time is of interest , then such a demonstration is equivalent to showing that the numerical procedure correctly calculates these quanitities of interest .",
    "we note , however , that the average duration of walks occuring on a particular path is just the sum of the average times required for each step along the way .",
    "the average time that the particle waits at a given site @xmath173 as described above , before hopping is@xmath174 in the numerical procedure described in sec .",
    "ii , on the other hand , the hopping time distribution function is not a continuous exponential distribution , but a discrete one , i.e. , the particle can only leave site @xmath14 at integral multiples @xmath175 of the basic time step @xmath176 the probability @xmath177 that it does so at the @xmath178th such step is @xmath179where @xmath180 and @xmath181 the average time that it spends at this site , with the numerical procedure we have implemented , is then easy to compute .",
    "we find @xmath182which is the same as for the ( correct ) continuous exponential jump time distribution function , and that it is , as claimed , independent of the size of the time step , provided that all transition probabilities remain positive .",
    "it is clear that for the computation of access times , one could implement any hopping time distribution that has the correct mean pausing time at each site .",

    "notice that the effects of adopting different network structures are more noticeable for large shortcut densities ( close to @xmath183 ) , since otherwise the behavior tends to the universal diffusion limit previously discussed ."

    "<S> an analytic effective medium theory is constructed to study the mean access times for random walks on hybrid disordered structures formed by embedding complex networks into regular lattices , considering transition rates @xmath0 that are different for steps across lattice bonds from the rates @xmath1 across network shortcuts . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is developed for structures with arbitrary shortcut distributions and applied to a class of partially - disordered traversal enhanced networks in which shortcuts of fixed length are distributed randomly with finite probability . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with predictions of the effective medium theory on all aspects addressed by the latter . </S>",
    "<S> access times for random walks on these partially disordered structures are compared to those on small - world networks , which on average appear to provide the most effective means of decreasing access times uniformly across the network . </S>"
