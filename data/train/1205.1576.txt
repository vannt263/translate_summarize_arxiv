    "the orion - kl region is a very dynamic system with complicated molecular distributions , complex velocity structure , and extreme temperature and density gradients .",
    "orion - kl has traditionally been viewed as a source that displays a high degree of nitrogen - oxygen  chemical differentiation \" where oxygen - bearing molecules like methyl formate [ hcooch@xmath3 and nitrogen - bearing molecules like ethyl cyanide [ c@xmath1h@xmath2cn ] are spatially distinct .",
    "it has been suggested that this  chemical differentiation \" can be driven by the molecular processes at work in these regions @xcite , with gas - phase reactions potentially accounting for the spatial separation of methyl formate and formic acid [ hcooh ] emission peaks in this source .",
    "however , recent high - resolution observations of molecular emission in this region @xcite have called into question the traditional view of  chemical differentiation \" in this source . the most recent set of high spatial - resolution images presented by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) indicate that while the emission peaks for o - bearing and n - bearing molecules are spatially - separated in orion - kl , the bulk of the complex molecular emission is co - spatial ; and that any spatial differences are limited to smaller , localized regions .",
    "it is unclear from these observations whether chemical or physical processes shape these molecular distributions .",
    "while gas - phase chemical processing is a likely factor , it is also possible that varying physical conditions , including temperature , density , and kinematics , could influence the molecular spatial distributions in these regions .",
    "however , only a limited amount of high spatial resolution information is available for this source , making definitive conclusions regarding the relative influence of these factors extremely difficult to determine .",
    "high resolution observations that probe the physical influence on the chemistry are necessary to disentangle and interpret these complicated processes .    here",
    "we extend the high spatial resolution observations of orion - kl reported in paper i to examine the physical conditions of this region . using observations of methanol [ ch@xmath4oh ]",
    ", we probe the temperature and velocity structure of this region .",
    "we also use the velocity information gained from these observations to develop a kinematic model for orion - kl , and examine the influence of these kinematics on the molecular distributions in this source .",
    "we then compare this information with the molecular emission images reported in paper i. from these results , we draw conclusions as to the mechanisms that are shaping the spatial distributions for each molecule observed .",
    "the observations , results , and discussion are presented below .",
    "the observations were conducted with the combined array for research in millimeter wave astronomy ( carma ) , and the details of the observations are presented in paper i. in addition to those observations , we conducted observations in the carma c configuration in 2010 april .",

    "the antenna - based gain calibration was done by self - calibrating on the sio maser in source i at 86.243 ghz .",
    "the solution was then bootstrapped to the other windows .",
    "phase offsets between each band and the sio band were calculated and removed by using observations of 0423 - 013 .",
    "uranus was used to calibrate the absolute amplitudes of 0423 - 013 and these are accurate to within @xmath1120% .",
    "the internal noise source was used to correct the passbands of each 31 mhz window , and observations of 0423 - 013 were used to correct the passbands of the 125 mhz windows .",
    "the data were calibrated , continuum subtracted , and imaged using the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "note that the flux of the point source bn ( see @xcite ) is similar across all array configurations , indicating that the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration between the different tracks is better than 95% .    in order to characterize the temperature profile of this region , 13 methanol transitions corresponding to 11 separate spectral lines were observed simultaneously .",
    "methanol is widespread throughout the orion - kl region , and therefore is an ideal tracer for the physical properties of the region .",
    "these 13 transitions span 2.3 orders of magnitude in upper state energy , thus providing a broad range of samples .",

    "thus , it seems that c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  can be present at a range of physical conditions , including very dense and hot regions and less dense and cooler regions .",
    "regardless , a heating source seems to be required for its formation or liberation .",
    "the hcooch@xmath4  emission appears to be coming from two distinct regions .",
    "the first is quite extended , near the location of the compact ridge .",
    "this region is not associated with any strong continuum emission .",
    "this region is on the extreme leading edge of the outflow from source i , indicating that the hcooch@xmath4  is being liberated from grain surfaces .",
    "this emission region is likely the primary contributor of flux in single dish observations , as it would be least affected by beam dilution .    by comparing the compact hcooch@xmath4  emission with the different tracers",
    ", it appears that the vast majority of this emission comes from regions on the outer , lower column density portions of the sio outflow ; lower temperature ( @xmath59150 k ) areas ; and areas of lower dust concentration .",
    "there is some notable emission from the hottest / densest parts of orion - kl , but these regions coincide with the edge of the hcooch@xmath4  emission .",
    "it appears that hcooch@xmath4  is released into the gas phase by the initial expanding shock from the outflow , and is destroyed by the arrival of the higher density , higher temperature components of the outflow .",
    "hcooch@xmath4  is likely processed through additional gas - phase reactions once it is liberated from the grain mantle material .",
    "unlike the case of c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  emission peaking in the warmer regions , there are no signs of hcooch@xmath4  being formed in the warmer regions of the source , as its emission peaks are offset from these warmer regions and instead coincide with the leading edges of the shocks .",
    "while there are no corresponding high - resolution images for ( ch@xmath4)@xmath1co , the existing images reveal that it does not have a distribution that matches either c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  or hcooch@xmath4 .",
    "instead , acetone appears to peak in the region of most significant overlap between hcooch@xmath4  and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  ( as was originally reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the primary peak is located in the warm transition region between the hot and dense part of the outflow , and the cooler outer edges .",
    "however , there is notable emission from both the hottest and densest parts of the cloud , as well as the cooler and less dense regions .",
    "this indicates that ( ch@xmath4)@xmath1co  is present in a wide variety of physical conditions , and its emission may therefore be shaped primarily by chemical processes rather than the physical conditions of the cloud .",
    "hcooh  has a unique distribution relative to the physical tracers when compared to the other molecules in this study .",
    "its strongest emission peak is located on the extreme outer edge of the sio outflow , where there is no detectable continuum emission .",
    "there are a few , weaker hcooh  peaks in the warmer denser regions , but overall it appears that hcooh  is easily released by the shocks from the outflow , and then easily destroyed in the higher density and warmer regions .",
    "this is consistent with chemical models that predict that formic acid is readily processed through gas - phase reactions @xcite .",
    "we have presented carma observations of several molecular species , including ethyl cyanide , methyl formate , acetone , and formic acid , toward orion - kl .",
    "these observations cover over an order of magnitude in spatial resolution , yielding excellent sensitivity to both small- and large - scale structures .",
    "we have compared these results with tracers of physical conditions ( temperature , continuum column density , and dynamics ) .",
    "overall , the results presented here indicate that the distributions of complex molecules trace the dynamics of the region , and that in some cases varying physical conditions can affect the morphology of molecular emission .",
    "these results indicate that all of the observed species can exist in a range of temperature and density conditions ; hcooh  appears to have the narrowest range of stability in terms of temperature and density , while c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  can exist in the widest range of conditions .",
    "furthermore , it appears that chemical processing may produce ( ch@xmath4)@xmath1co  under a variety of physical conditions , while hcooh  is readily destroyed by gas - phase processing in warmer , dense regions .",
    "lastly , it appears that the traditional view of nitrogen - oxygen  chemical differentiation \" in orion - kl , where different chemistries lead to spatially - distinct emission regions for these two classes of molecules , does not give the complete picture of this region .",
    "hcooch@xmath4  and c@xmath1h@xmath2cn  are found to be primarily co - spatial in this source .",
    "instead of being shaped by chemical processing , local physical conditions like temperature and density most dramatically shape the relative distributions of these particular molecules .",
    "these results reveal that astrochemical modeling of sources must include the effects of physical conditions and differing spatial distributions before the observations of a given source can be compared directly to the model .",
    "sophisticated hydrodynamic models will be required to fully interpret the results presented here .",

    "we thank c. goddi for supplying an ammonia temperature map of orion - kl .",
