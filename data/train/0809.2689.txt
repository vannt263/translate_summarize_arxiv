    "understanding correlation effects is one major goal of condensed matter physics .",
    "strong correlations manifest themselves in various forms . the paramagnetic mott - hubbard metal - insulator - transition ( pmit)@xcite is a well - known and interesting example . with increasing interaction strength the fermi liquid state breaks down at a critical value and an insulator",
    "is formed .",
    "another fundamental example is magnetism , where electrons reduce the energetic cost of the coulomb - interaction by ordering .",
    "both effects can of course occur simultaneously and are the heart of the extremely rich phase diagram of e.g. transition metal compounds like for example v@xmath3o@xmath4 or latio@xmath4@xcite .    besides strong correlations , another major ingredient for the understanding of the phase diagram of compounds like v@xmath3o@xmath4 is frustration .",
    "v@xmath3o@xmath4 crystallizes in the corundum structure with the v - ions located on a honeycomb lattice in the ab - plane , while along the c - axis a more complicated coordination is observed , which induces frustration of the magnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless does the phase diagram of v@xmath3o@xmath4 show an antiferromagnetic phase at temperatures below @xmath5 . upon doping with ti one",
    "may suppress this order .",
    "such a doping with a smaller ion can be viewed as internal pressure,@xcite hence the suppression of the magnetic order is commonly interpreted as happening through an increase of the bandwidth respectively a decrease of the correlation effects .",
    "consequently , the critical ti doping is conventionally related to the existence of a lower critical value of the electronic interaction parameter . at higher temperatures",
    "the antiferromagnetic state becomes unstable towards a paramagnet and one can eventually observe a paramagnetic metal - insulator - transition up to temperatures @xmath6 .",
    "frustration is a quite common feature in real materials .",
    "very interesting examples for frustrated systems are layered organic compounds like @xmath7-(bedt - ttf)2x@xcite .",
    "they have a similar phase diagram as the high - temperature superconductors ( htsc)@xcite .",
    "the phases of these organic systems are controlled by pressure and frustration rather than by doping as in htsc@xcite .",
    "they are usually described by an anisotropic triangular lattice , and changing the anion ( x ) in these systems modifies the frustration of the lattice .",
    "besides superconductivity also magnetic ordering and a pmit can be found .",
    "these two examples by no means exhaust the zoo of materials showing such interplay or competition between pmit and ordered phases@xcite .",
    "for example , rare - earth compounds like ce(rh , ir)@xmath8(co , ir)@xmath9in@xmath10 do show a similarly bizarre phase diagram@xcite .",
    "besides their usually complicated lattice structure another challenge for a theoretical description of such compounds is that the presence of elements with partially filled d- or f - shells in principle requires a multi - orbital description to account for effects like hund s or spin - orbit coupling properly .",
    "furthermore the residual degeneracies in the solid state crystalline environment lead to degenerate multiplets which in turn can give rise to even more complex structures like orbital order or polaron formation ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview and references ) .",
    "although all these ingredients play an important role for a quantitative theoretical description of transition - metal or rare - earth compounds , we here want to focus on the one - orbital situation , in particular on the relation between pmit and antiferromagnetism .",
    "this restriction to a simpler but by no means trivial situation will enable us to investigate the relation between these two paradigms of correlation effects with a small and controllable set of parameters and thus obtain some hint to how both phases interact .",
    "a model suitable for analyzing this kind of physics is provided through the hubbard model@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the density operator for spin up(down ) at site i. the parameters @xmath16 represent the hopping amplitude from @xmath14 to @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the interaction strength . in this paper",
    "we will measure the interaction relative to the bandwidth , which is related to the hopping amplitude .",
    "although at first sight very simplistic , this model is highly nontrivial .",
    "besides other methods , especially in one dimension , progress in understanding its physics was achieved by the development of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite . the dmft is a very powerful tool for analyzing strongly correlated lattice systems , mapping the lattice problem onto a quantum impurity problem , which has to be solved self consistently",
    ". for solving this impurity problem for arbitrary interaction strengths and temperatures we here use wilson s numerical renormalization group@xcite .",
    "an interesting fact is that the only information about the lattice structure , which enters a dmft self consistency calculation , is the local density of states ( dos ) of the non - interacting system .",
    "we performed our calculations for a bethe lattice with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    .",
    "observe the van - hove singularity at the lower band edge . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are scaled with the bandwidth @xmath21.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the dos in this case can be calculated using a topological ansatz@xcite .",
    "starting from a particle - hole symmetric dos at @xmath22 the density of states becomes now asymmetric with increasing @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ frustdos ] ) and develops a van - hove singularity at the lower band edge for positive and increasing nnn - hopping @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath22 , where the particle - hole symmetry can be employed to fix the filling at @xmath23 precisely , the asymmetry present for @xmath24 makes it more difficult to perform calculations with the filling kept at @xmath23 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "thus dmft calculations typically take much longer here due to the necessary adjustment of the chemical potential .",
    "of course the bethe lattice does not represent a lattice realized in real materials .",
    "however , in contrast to the hypercubic lattice with infinite coordination number the bethe lattice has a compact support and thus possesses band edges , which provides a more realistic scenario .    since the early days of dmft",
    ", there have been many contributions by different groups to the subject of the pmit and antiferromagnetism.@xcite however , frustration effects up to now where introduced in dmft typically within the so - called two - sublattice fully frustrated model@xcite , which results in a particle - hole symmetric dos even with frustration . as side effect , this way of introducing frustration leaves the paramagnetic phase unchanged . for the non - frustrated system",
    "the pmit is then completely covered by the antiferromagnetic phase , which exists for half - filling for all finite values of @xmath18@xcite . for the frustrated system ,",
    "on the other hand , there exists a lower critical value for the interaction @xmath18 , which increases with increasing frustration .",
    "it was furthermore found that the nel - temperature decreases with increasing frustration such that the pmit outgrows the antiferromagnetic phase@xcite . in early calculations using this way of introducing frustration based on exact diagonalization studies of the two - sublattice",
    "fully frustrated model@xcite , the authors also found parameter regions in the phase diagram where an antiferromagnetic metal appeared to be stable .",
    "however , this antiferromagnetic metal phase was later traced back to numerical subtleties in the exact diagonalization procedure and shown to be actually absent from the phase diagram@xcite .",
    "the first attempt to study the hubbard model on the bethe lattice with correct inclusion of nn- and nnn - hopping has been performed rather recently@xcite . in this work",
    "the authors concentrated on the paramagnetic pmit and found phase - separation between the insulating and metallic phase .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the pmit as well as antiferromagnetism and concentrate on the competition between the paramagnetic phase including the pmit and the antiferromagnetic phase at intermediate and high grades of frustration .",
    "we especially look at the case @xmath25 and raise the question , if the scenario of the outgrowing pmit , proposed in @xcite , still holds for the correct asymmetric density of states .",
    "the paper is arranged as following .",
    "after this introduction we start with a brief look at the pmit , followed by a discussion of the phase diagram at half - filling including antiferromagnetism and the pmit .",
    "the next paragraph addresses especially the case of very strong frustration and the question how the magnetic order is realized there . the paper will be closed by a summary of our results and an outlook .",
    "the metal insulator transition for the bethe lattice with nnn - hopping has been analyzed by @xcite within the self - energy functional approach@xcite .",
    "they particularly focused on @xmath26 and discussed an unexpected occurrence of phase separation in the paramagnetic state between a mott - hubbard insulator and a correlated metal at and near half - filling . here",
    "we want to investigate the behavior of the system as function of increasing frustration . due to symmetry",
    "there is no difference between @xmath1 and @xmath27 .",
    "the calculations were done using wilson s nrg as impurity solver for the dmft , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 states kept per nrg step and a logarithmic broadening @xmath30 to obtain spectral functions .",
    "we want to note at this point that the choice of nrg numerical parameters does not influence the qualitative nature of the results .",
    "we observe , however , small dependencies on @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which tend to become more pronounced close to phase transitions and may result in systematic errors in numerical values for critical parameters of the order of @xmath33.@xcite    figure [ pmit ] shows the paramagnetic metal insulator transition for various values @xmath34 . as energy - scale",
    "we choose the bandwidth @xmath35      \\mbox{$4\\vert t_2\\vert + 2t_1+t_1 ^ 2/(4\\vert t_2\\vert)$ for $ \\vert t_2\\vert > t_1/4 $ }    \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    of the non - interacting system .",
    "note that these results are obtained by artificially suppressing an antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "the occupation was kept fixed at @xmath36 by adjusting the chemical potential .",
    "note that in contrast to the case with @xmath22 it is not possible to achieve @xmath37 here within numerical precision due to the asymmetric dos ( see fig .",
    "[ frustdos ] ) .        for increasing @xmath2 the pmit",
    "is shifted towards lower interaction strengths and also lower temperatures .",
    "while the shift in the interaction strength is rather moderate , we notice a large difference in the temperature of the critical endpoint between the unfrustrated and highly frustrated system .",
    "this observation of course renews our interest in the question , to what extent long - range hopping can help to push the paramagnetic mit out of the expected antiferromagnetic phase for reasonable magnitudes of @xmath1 to create a phase diagram similar to the one found for v@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "the scenario proposed by @xcite relied on the fact that the paramagnetic phase largely remains unaltered with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "as the nel - temperature for the antiferromagnet is reduced at the same time , the pmit can eventually outgrow the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "we now allow for antiferromagnetic ordering in our calculations . to this end",
    "we reformulate the dmft for an ab lattice structure@xcite to accommodate the nel ordering and initialize the calculation with a small staggered field , which is turned off after one dmft iteration .",
    "the system then either evolves into a paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic state with increasing number of dmft iterations .",

    "the shaded areas were constructed representing the antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "this of course means that the phase boundaries shown here must be considered as guess only .",
    "however , as we do not expect any strange structures to appear , this guess will presumably represent the true phase boundary within a few percent .",
    "the full lines in fig .",
    "[ phase1 ] are the pmit transitions .",
    "note that for both diagrams the same division of axes was chosen .",
    "in contrast to the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice with @xmath22 , there now exists a finite critical value @xmath41 , below which no antiferromagnetism can be stabilized even for temperature @xmath42 . with increasing frustration the paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition is shifted towards higher interaction strengths and lower temperatures , while the pmit is shifted towards lower interactions strengths .",
    "so obviously the pmit is shifted towards the phase boundaries of the antiferromagnetic dome .",
    "so far this is the expected effect of the nnn - hopping which introduces frustration to the antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "however , note that although @xmath39 represents already a very strongly frustrated system , the pmit still lies well covered within the antiferromagnetic phase .",

    "the full lines represent the transition from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic state with increasing interaction strength for two different temperatures , while the dashed lines represent the transitions from the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state with decreasing interaction strength . in the upper panel ( small @xmath18 )",
    "one can clearly see a hysteresis of the antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "this hysteresis as well as the jump in the magnetization are clear signs for a first order transition .",
    "this antiferromagnetic hysteresis is very pronounced for strong frustration but numerically not resolvable for example for @xmath43 .",
    "we believe that the hysteresis region shrinks with decreasing @xmath1 and eventually can not be resolved anymore with numerical techniques . the whole temperature depending hysteresis region can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hysteresis ] for the case @xmath39 .",
    "one can see clearly the shrinking of the hysteresis region with increasing temperature .",
    "note that such a hysteresis is also found in the two - sublattice fully frustrated model,@xcite which means that this quite likely is a generic effect in frustrated systems at intermediate coupling strengths .    the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ hysteresis2 ] shows the staggered magnetization for temperatures just below the corresponding nel - temperatures and at large interaction strengths . here",
    "the magnetization vanishes smoothly , which is the behavior expected for a second order phase transition . in summary",
    "we thus find a first order transition at the critical interaction @xmath41 where antiferromagnetism sets in , and a second order transition for the large coulomb parameter @xmath44 .",
    "including the temperature depending hysteresis region ( between dashed and full line ) .",
    "the meaning of symbols is as in fig .",
    "[ phase1 ] .",
    "the shaded area is as before meant as guide to the eye .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the merging from both transition lines is an interesting point in itself .",
    "there must be a critical point where the first order transition changes into a second order transition .",
    "it is however not possible to resolve this merging within dmft / nrg .",
    "first , the logarithmic discretization of the temperatures within the nrg does not allow to resolve this merging - region with arbitrary precision .",
    "second , the magnetization of the system becomes very small in this region , so it is not possible to distinguish between a ( tiny ) jump and numerical artifacts of a smoothly vanishing order parameter .",
    "consequently , we can not decide anymore of what order the transition will be .    antiferromagnetic metallic phases at half - filling were reported in earlier publications . in our calculations we saw no evidence for an antiferromagnetic metallic state at half - filling . especially for strong frustration @xmath45",
    "the system directly jumps from a paramagnetic metallic solution into an antiferromagnetic insulating solution with high magnetization . in the papers cited , the region showing an antiferromagnetic metallic solution broadens with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this prediction we clearly can not confirm , as discussed above . only in systems with small to intermediate frustration there are narrow interaction regimes where we observe a small finite weight at the fermi level .",
    "one must however consider that the occupation number is not exactly one but only within @xmath46 .",
    "also it was sometimes difficult to stabilize a dmft solution in these regions . in summary , we can not see any clear signs for an antiferromagnetic metallic state at half - filling in our calculations . if any exists , then only for rather low frustration in a very small regime about the critical interaction . to what extent",
    "these rather special conditions can then be considered as realistic for real materials is yet another question .",
    "in this last paragraph we want to study the situation , in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are comparable in strength .",
    "interestingly , there has been no attempt to calculate the phase diagram on a mean - field level in the strongly frustrated model @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , before discussing the results of the dmft calculations for strongly frustrated systems @xmath48 let us try to gain some insight into the physics we must expect , by inspecting classical spins on a bethe lattice with nn - interaction @xmath49 and nnn - interaction @xmath50 . allowing that nearest - neighbor spins enclose an angle @xmath51",
    "one ends up with the energy functional @xmath52 performing the same limits and scaling as in dmft one finds ( see appendix a ) @xmath53 thus , the nel - state with @xmath54 is the stable ground state for @xmath55 , while one finds a spin wave with @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    for the dmft calculations we can allow only for solutions commensurate with the lattice",
    "this however will possibly be inconsistent with the spin structure favored by the system .",
    "if , for example , we perform a calculation focusing on the ferromagnetic solution within a parameter regime , where the system wants to order antiferromagnetically , dmft will not converge . to investigate spin wave states with periodicities with more than two lattice sites",
    ", one has to set up the correct dmft self - consistency equations respecting the lattice structure . while for a system on an infinite bethe lattice with nn hopping",
    "only it is straightforward to extend the dmft to commensurate magnetic structures with periodicities of more than two lattice sites , we did not succeed in devising a scheme that allows for such calculations for systems with nnn hopping .",
    "the reason is that one has to partition the lattice into an @xmath58 structure .",
    "however , the nnn hopping makes it impossible to uniquely identify the connectivity of the respective sublattices .",
