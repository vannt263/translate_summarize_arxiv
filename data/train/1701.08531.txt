    "accurate temperature readings at nanoscales find applications in several research areas , spanning from materials science @xcite , medicine and biology  @xcite , to quantum thermodynamics @xcite , where it is crucial for controlling the performances of quantum thermal devices .",
    "the interest in this field is also motivated by the recent developments of nanoscale thermometry such as carbon nanothermometers  @xcite , diamond sensors  @xcite , scanning thermal microscopes  @xcite , _",
    "etc_.     via the measurements on a probing system @xmath0 . ]    here we shall focus on a specific , yet rather general , thermometric task where the temperature of a sample characterized by a large number of subcomponents , also called reservoir , is indirectly recovered by monitoring a small probe that is put in thermal contact with the reservoir : see fig .",
    "[ figu1 ] . specifically the setting we consider is related to quantum thermometry , which aims to use low dimensional quantum systems ( say qubits ) as effective thermometers to minimize the undesired disturbance on the sample : see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . from a theoretical point view , the standard approaches to this kind of problems typically start from three hypotheses :    1 .",
    "the reservoir is in a thermal state ; 2 .",
    "the probing system interacts for enough time with the bath so as to reach thermal equilibrium ; 3 .",
    "independent and identically distributed ( iid ) measurements : the experimentalist has at disposal a certain number of probes , prepared in the same input state , which interact with the bath and are measured independently . equivalently the experimentalist might reinitialize the state of the single probe after each measurement stage .",
    "recently correa _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite proved that , under the above three assumptions , optimal thermometers correspond to employing atoms with a single energy gap and maximally degenerate first excited levels . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interaction time with the reservoir is not long enough to allow complete thermalization of the probe ( i.e.  hypothesis _ ii ) _ missed ) , the maximal thermal sensitivity of the setup is reached by initializing the probes in their ground states .",
    "even more fundamental limitations emerge in the low temperature regime , in which the thermalization process might be prevented by the strong enough correlations between the probe and the sample  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the drawbacks related to the iid assumption ( hypothesis _ iii ) _ of the list ) .",
    "in particular , the arbitrary initialization of independent probing systems at the beginning of the estimation procedure , or of a single probe at disposal after each measurement process , might encounter some obstructions , due to fundamental or practical reasons .",
    "one way to circumvent such difficulty is to rely on sequential measurement schemes ( smss )  @xcite , where repeated consecutive measurements are performed on a single probe while it is still in interaction with the bath without reinitializing it .",
    "the performance of sms will be therefore compared with the iid protocol in different specific situations , taking the fisher informations ( fis )  @xcite as the figure of merit for the corresponding temperature estimation accuracies .",
    "quite interestingly we will find that , while in most cases optimality is attained by the iid approach , the sms is more versatile as it is less affected by the choice of the initial state of the probe .",
    "this phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that in the sms approach the probe is forced to gradually lose the memory of the initial condition , moving towards a fixed point configuration , which keeps track of the bath temperature .",
    "hence , the recursive character of sms allows the probing system to `` adapt '' to the reservoir , in such a way that even a non - optimal initialization of the probe can in the end provide a relatively good estimation of the temperature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ the_model ] , after briefly describing the mathematical model for the bosonic reservoir , we will present the iid and sms strategies and show how to compute the fi in the two cases for generic measurements .",
    "a specific family of them will be selected in sec .",
