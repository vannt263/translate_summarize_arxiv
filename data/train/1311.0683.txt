    "the traditional paradigm that stars in globular clusters ( gc ) are an example of a coeval and chemically homogeneous population was challenged by photometric and spectroscopic results , which highlighted the presence of at least two generations of stars : a first generation ( fg ) , with the chemistry of the cloud from which the cluster formed , and an additional component ( second generation , hereinafter sg ) , with a composition showing the signature of proton  capture nucleosynthesis .    the surface abundances of stars belonging to the sg define abundance patterns , where sodium is correlated to aluminium , and anticorrelated to magnesium and oxygen . the extension and the slope of these trends change from cluster to cluster , but it is interesting that they have been detected within each gc investigated so far @xcite .",
    "these chemical anomalies involve only  light ",
    "elements , up to silicon , whereas no spread is observed in the iron content cen   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m 22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "their chemical evolution must have been more complex than in standard mono  metallic clusters . ] .",
    "on the photometric side , the hypothesis that the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) of some gcs could be explained by the presence of two or more populations , differing in their original content of helium , came from the seminal paper by @xcite , and subsequently extended to ngc 2808 @xcite , m3 and m13 @xcite , ngc 6441 @xcite .",
    "these early speculations were later confirmed by detailed photometric analysis of the main sequence ( ms ) of the cluster ngc 2808 , which was shown to be split in three components , differing in their helium content @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigations detected a splitting in the ms of ngc 6752 @xcite , and in the subgiant branches ( sgbs ) of ngc 1851 , ngc 6656 , 47 tuc , and other five gcs @xcite .",
    "this impressive set of evidence indicates that in most ( if not all ) gcs a self  enrichment mechanism must have produced gas contaminated by p  capture nucleosynthesis , such that one or more additional generations of stars formed , and are currently co - existing with the original population .",
    "according to the most complete scenario suggested so far , a crucial role as polluters of the intra ",
    "cluster medium was played by stars of intermediate mass during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase @xcite .",
    "the paper by @xcite set the theoretical framework to describe the formation of sg stars in gcs , by gas ejected by agbs possibly mixed with pristine gas , survived to the epoch of supernovae explosions .",
    "this approach allowed to reconstruct the formation of multiple populations in m4 ( an example of a cluster showing mild anomalies ) and ngc 2808 ( example of a cluster hosting , in addition , an extremely helium rich population ) @xcite .    as we will show in this paper to reproduce the observed abundance patterns processed gas provided only by agb stars with masses between about 5m@xmath2 and 8m@xmath2 can be used along with some pristine gas .",
    "as already discussed in several of the papers cited above , the amount of gas available for sg formation in this scenario ( as well in other competing scenarios for which a detailed study of the resulting abundance patterns have been investigated ; see e.g. @xcite ) implies that the fg cluster must have initially been more massive .",
    "we discuss the specific implications of the model presented here in section 4 .",
    "the globular cluster ngc 104 , better known as 47 tuc , is a valuable test to understand the formation process of multiple populations in globular clusters . until a few years ago it was considered as the prototype of a single stellar population , based on the photometric morphology of the ms and the hb .",
    "the first challenge to this belief came from the analysis based on the hst archival data by @xcite , showing the splitting of the sgb in two components , separated in magnitude .",
    "@xcite then showed that the morphology of the hb of 47 tuc is consistent with the presence of two populations , differing in helium content up to a maximum of @xmath3 .",
    "such interpretation was recently confirmed by the detailed photometric analysis published in @xcite , who explained the complex of the observed colours of ms stars with a couple of populations , one with the primeval composition , and another with a small helium enhancement , which , in agreement with @xcite , is within @xmath4 .    from a spectroscopic point of view , a bimodal distribution of cn band strengths among giant stars belonging to 47 tuc was found by @xcite .",
    "the following analyses by @xcite and @xcite , showed that this bimodality still exists 2.5 mag below the turn off , suggesting the presence of two populations in the cluster , differing in their chemistry .",
    "the presence of a o  na anticorrelation in unevolved stars was first detected by @xcite , based on the spectroscopic analysis of 7 objects , confirmed by @xcite and by @xcite , who investigated a much more complete sample , made of 109 sources .",
    "a step forward was made by @xcite , who found a correlation among the color of hb stars and the abundances of oxygen , sodium and aluminium , and by @xcite , who presented the chemical patterns defined by 116 giants in 47 tuc .",
    "this rich set of data allows one to test whether the self  enrichment mechanism by agbs can explain the patterns traced by stars in 47 tuc , and account for the distribution of hb and ms stars in the color  magnitude diagram .",
    "for this purpose , we calculated a set of agb models having an input chemistry appropriate for stars in this cluster , we determined the composition of the ejecta , and tested whether the observed patterns extension and slope are reproduced .",
    "we use work by @xcite and @xcite to determine the dilution with pristine material needed to allow the maximum spread of helium detected : this will set a limit to the most extreme chemistry that can be obtained .",
    "the evolutionary sequences used in the present investigation were calculated by means of the aton code for stellar evolution . the interested reader may find in @xcite a detailed description of the code .",
    "the micro and macro  physics adopted are the same as in the recent investigations by our group on this topic , and can be found .",
    "e.g. , in @xcite .    in regions unstable to convective motions ,",
    "the temperature gradient is found via the full spectrum of turbulence ( hereianfter fst ) model @xcite .",
    "mixing of chemicals is coupled to nuclear burning via a diffusive approach , using the schematization by @xcite .",
    "the overshoot of convective bubbles into radiatively stable regions is described by an exponential decay of convective velocities , characterized by an e ",
    "folding distance proportional to the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "for all the evolutionary phases preceding the agb phase we chose @xmath6 , in agreement with our previous explorations , based on the calibration given in @xcite . for the agb evolution",
    ", we calibrated the possible extra  mixing from the base of the convective envelope and from the borders of the convective shell which forms following the ignition of thermal pulses in order to reproduce the luminosity function of carbon stars in the large magellanic cloud . by following this approach , similar to @xcite , we find @xmath7 .",
    "the range of masses involved is @xmath8 .",
    "models of smaller mass hardly experience the agb phase , and are however not of interest for the scope of this paper . stars of mass exceeding 8m@xmath2 are expected to undergo core  collapse , thus skipping the agb phase . for each mass",
    "we followed the evolution from the pre ",
    "main sequence up to the almost complete loss of the convective envelope . models of mass below 2m@xmath2 experience the helium flash at the tip of their red giant phase .",
    "the evolutionary sequences for these masses were re  started from the horizontal branch , where he  burning takes place in the non degenerate core resulting from the flash .",
    "stars of mass above 6.5m@xmath2 undergo carbon ignition in a degenerate layer above the core : these models develop a core made up of oxygen and neon , and experience a series of thermal pulses , as their lower mass counterparts @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial composition in terms of metal and helium abundance is z=0.004 and y=0.26 .",
    "this chemistry is similar to the models presented in @xcite , based on the mass fractions of the individual species given by @xcite ; the difference is that in the present investigation the mixture is assumed to be alpha  enhanced , with [ @xmath9fe]=+0.2 ( in @xcite we used [ @xmath9fe]=+0.4 ) . these choices , assuming a solar metallicity z@xmath10 , correspond to an iron content [ fe / h]@xmath0 , the same measured in 47 tuc stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xcite paper we calculated the sagb evolution of stars with mass m@xmath11m@xmath2 .      following the pioneering investigations by @xcite , we know that stars of intermediate mass , after the end of core helium burning , experience a series of thermal pulses ( tps ) , in the evolutionary phase known as asymptotic giant branch . an updated , exhaustive description of the main features of the agb evolution can be found , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the composition of the gas ejected by agbs depends on the interface between the two mechanisms able to alter the surface chemistry : a ) third dredge  up ( tdu ) , i.e. the inwards penetration of the convective envelope down to layers previously touched by 3@xmath12 activity , and b ) hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , with the activation of p  capture nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the surface convective layer @xcite .",
    "tdu favours the increase of the surface carbon , and is the dominant mechanism in low  mass agbs , with m@xmath13m@xmath2 .",
    "more massive stars may experience hbb , provided that the temperature at the base of their envelope exceeds @xmath14mk .",
    "the efficiency of both mechanisms is unfortunately sensitive to the macro ",
    "physics description used .",
    "the extent of tdu depends on the treatment of convective borders , particularly to the extra  mixing from the base of the convective envelope and the boundaries of the convective shell which forms after each tp .",
    "the strength of hbb is extremely sensitive to the convective model adopted @xcite .",
    "models calculated with the full spectrum of turbulence description of the convective regions are found to experience a much stronger hbb in comparisons with models of same mass and metallicity calculated by means of the traditional mixing length theory of turbulent convection .",
    "table [ yields ] summarizes the main physical and chemical results for the models investigated . for each mass",
    "we show the evolutionary time scale , the core mass at the beginning of the agb phase , the maximum temperature achieved at the bottom of the convective envelope , and the average composition of the ejecta .",
    "for the i  th element we indicate the quantity [ i / fe]=@xmath15(x@xmath16/x(fe))-@xmath15(x@xmath16/x(fe))@xmath2 . for helium and lithium",
    "we show , respectively , the average mass fraction in the ejecta ( y ) , and the quantity @xmath15(@xmath17(li))=@xmath15(n(li)/n(h))+12 .    col .",
    "5 of table 1 shows that the ejecta of agbs are helium  rich , as a consequence of the two dredge  up episodes following the core h and he  burning phases , and , for the models experiencing hbb , of the p  capture nucleosynthesis at the bottom of the surface convective layer .",
    "models with mass exceeding 5m@xmath2 produce ejecta with a helium mass fraction @xmath18 , almost 0.1 larger than the initial abundance .",
    "this prediction , unlike those regarding the other species , is rather robust , because most of the helium enrichment occurs during the second dredge  up , which makes this finding independent of the uncertainties affecting the following thermal pulses phase @xcite .",
    "the three panels of fig .",
    "[ cno ] show the average content of the gas ejected as a function of the initial mass , in terms of the mass fractions of carbon ( left panel ) , nitrogen ( middle ) and oxygen ( right ) . to better understand the extent of the variation from the initial content of each species",
    ", we show the ratio between the average and the initial abundance .",
    "the present results are compared with previous findings for different metallicities published in @xcite , and with models of the same metallicity by @xcite ( hereinafter k10 ) .",
    "both the present models and those by k10 show an increase in the carbon content of the ejecta in the low  mass domain , for m@xmath13m@xmath2 : this is due to the repeated tdu episodes , that transport to the stellar surface carbon synthesized in the @xmath19 burning shell .",
    "the trend of x(@xmath20c ) with mass is rather similar in the two cases , as also the maximum increase in the carbon content , found to be @xmath21(c)@xmath22 dex .",
    "the results between this investigation and the work by k10 are different for @xmath23m@xmath2 , because our models experience a stronger hbb , with a faster destruction of the surface carbon : while the yields by k10 are enriched in carbon for all masses , our models experiencing hbb show a carbon decrease , which reaches the asymptotic value of @xmath21(c)@xmath24 dex in the sagb domain .",
    "the different extent of the hbb experienced is also the reason for the difference in the oxygen content of the ejecta ( see right panel ) for @xmath23m@xmath2 : in the present compilation the oxygen is systematically lower than in k10 , with the only exception of the 6m@xmath2 model , which shows the same depletion of @xmath21(o)@xmath25 dex in the two cases .",
    "the trend of the nitrogen abundance with mass shows an abrupt increase around @xmath26m@xmath2 , because in that range of mass the carbon dredged  up to the surface is converted into nitrogen during the following interpulse phase .",
    "note that in the @xmath23m@xmath2 domain our nitrogen yields are lower than k10 , because the stronger hbb experienced by our models limits the number of thermal pulses , and thus the amount of carbon available .",
    "an important consequence of the strong hbb in the envelope of massive agb models calculated with the fst description of convection is that tdu is scarcely efficient in modifying the surface chemistry : as discussed previously , the star loses the whole envelope after a limited number of tps , before tdu becomes efficient @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the overall c+n+o content of the ejecta of massive agbs ( with m@xmath27m@xmath2 ) and sagbs is practically unchanged with respect to the initial abundance , as expected from a pure p ",
    "capture nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the differences between models with different chemistry are due to the different impact of tdu and hbb in models with different metallicities . in the low mass domain , where the yields are dominated by tdu ,",
    "the percentage increase in the surface carbon is larger for models with lower z , because the same amount of carbon transported to the surface produces a larger increase in the surface abundance .",
    "the lower metallicity models experience a stronger hbb @xcite : this is the reason why models with z=@xmath28 have a much smaller oxygen content than their higher z counterparts .",
    "the opposite behaviour is found in the z=@xmath29 case , where only a modest depletion of the surface oxygen is achieved .",
    "we note in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cno ] that in the range of massive agbs and sagbs the low  z models are characterized by a broad range of oxygen , while the models with z=@xmath30 ( and even more those with z=@xmath29 ) have a much smaller variation of oxygen with mass .",
    "the reason for this difference is , again , the stronger hbb experienced by massive agbs of smaller metallicity : the fast increase in the surface luminosity favours a large increase in the mass loss rate , such that in the models with the largest core masses the envelope is lost rapidly , before an advanced nucleosynthesis can be achieved .",
    "the trend of the oxygen content of the ejecta with mass is consequently not monotonic , the sagb models showing up traces of a milder nuclear processing @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ naal ] we show the sodium and aluminium content of the ejecta of the models presented here , compared to models of different metallicities published in @xcite . in the [ na / fe][al / fe ] plane we only show the yields of masses experiencing hbb , with m@xmath31m@xmath2 .",
    "the interpretation of the aluminium abundances is straightforward .",
    "lower metallicity models undergo stronger hbb , thus the mg ",
    "al nucleosynthesis proceeds faster .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ yield ] , showing the variation of the surface al abundance in models of various mass and metallicity .",
    "the increase of al with respect to the initial abundance is enhanced in low  z models , whereas it is extremely small in the @xmath32 case . in the @xmath33 models ( and also in the @xmath34 ones ,",
    "not shown here for clarity reasons ) the temperatures at the bottom of the surface convective zone become so large that eventually an equilibrium stage is reached , such that the rates of production and destruction of aluminium balance each other @xcite : this is the motivation of the counter - clockwise shape of the [ na / fe][al / fe ] trends in fig .",
    "[ naal ] for these two metallicities , with the largest masses showing a smaller al  enhancement in their ejecta .    in the @xmath35 models presented here",
    "the temperature at the bottom of the convective envelope hardly exceeds @xmath36 k ( see col .  4 of table [ yields ] ) , thus the al  burning channel is never activated : the behaviour of the various masses involved is much more homogeneous ( see right panel of fig .  [ yield ] ) , and the extent of the increase in al in the ejecta is approximately independent of mass , for m@xmath1m@xmath2 : for the present mixture , massive agbs produce winds with an average increase in the aluminium content of @xmath21[al / fe]@xmath37 dex .",
    "the behaviour of sodium is more tricky , given the different sensitivity to temperature of the production and destruction channels @xcite .",
    "while for temperatures below @xmath38mk sodium is produced at the expense of neon , for larger t s the destruction process takes over .",
    "the typical behaviour of the surface sodium during the agb evolution ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ yield ] ) shows an initial increase , followed by a depletion of the surface abundance in the latest evolutionary phases .",
    "the higher is the temperature , the strongest is the rate at which sodium is consumed : lower metallicity models show on the average a lower content of sodium in the ejecta , as shown in fig .",
    "[ naal ] . in low",
    "z , sagb models , mass loss is so fast to prevent a great destruction of the surface sodium @xcite : this is the reason for the large sodium content in the ejecta of the most massive models of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    at @xmath35 sodium is initially produced in massive agbs , the surface abundance increasing by almost a factor @xmath39 compared to the initial mass fraction . unlike their lower z counterparts , the destruction process proceeds later at a very slow pace .",
    "the sodium content of the ejecta is not very sensitive to the initial mass : we find that the sodium increase in the gas lost is @xmath21[na / fe]@xmath37 dex .    to summarize our findings",
    ", we conclude that massive agbs with the chemistry examined here suffer a mild hbb .",
    "the gas ejected by these stars is expected to present the signature of p  capture burning , with the depletion of the surface content of oxygen of @xmath40 dex , and an enhancement of the surface sodium and aluminium of @xmath41 dex .",
    "the nucleosynthesis experienced is not sufficiently advanced to produce any modification of the surface silicon , whereas the overall content of magnesium is poorly reduced with respect to the initial abundance , of @xmath42 dexmg is lost , whereas @xmath43 mg is increased by almost one order of magnitude . ] .",
    "the gas ejected is helium  rich , with an average helium of @xmath18 . finally , for what concerns the overall content of cno , the yields from models with mass above @xmath44 are found to maintain the initial c+n+o , whereas for @xmath45m@xmath46m@xmath47m@xmath2 the increase in the total cno ranges from 20@xmath48 up to almost @xmath49 .",

    "capture nucleosynthesis .",
    "sodium is correlated to aluminium and to nitrogen , and anticorrelated to oxygen .",

    "na plane similar trends were found by the analysis focused on hb stars by @xcite , and by spectroscopy of unevolved stars of the same cluster @xcite .    to understand whether this set of observations can be explained on the basis of the self  enrichment mechanism by agbs",
    ", we compare the data available with the chemistry obtained by mixing gas from massive agbs and sagbs with gas assumed to share the primeval chemistry of the cluster , characterizing the fg component .",
    "the dilution of the chemistry reported in table [ yields ] for m@xmath1m@xmath2 with pristine material defines an abundance pattern , for different degrees of dilution .",
    "theoretically , all the results obtained with degrees of dilution ranging from 0 to 1 should be considered : however , the photometric analysis of the hb @xcite and of the ms of 47 tuc @xcite indicate that the range of helium abundances of the stars in the cluster is @xmath50y@xmath51 , which rules out the possibility that uncontaminated stars with the pure chemistry of agbs formed : based on the values shown in table [ yields ] , these stars should have a helium mass fraction y@xmath52 , which would determine a much wider spread of the ms .",
    "these arguments allow to determine the minimum degree of dilution from which the stars in the sg formed : mixing of pristine matter with y@xmath53 and gas from agbs with y@xmath54 leads to the maximum helium allowed from the photometric analysis , y@xmath55 , if we assume that the fraction of gas from agbs used to form sg stars is one third , the remaining being provided by pristine gas in the cluster . in the following analysis",
    "we will allow the relative contribution from gas ejected by agbs to range from a minimum of 0@xmath48 to a maximum of 35@xmath48 . obviously stars formed with no agb ejecta or with a very large fraction of pristine gas will have the chemical properties of fg stars and would not be classified as sg stars @xcite .",

    "the abundances of the ejecta lay in the upper  left portion of the plane , where the most contaminated objects are found .",
    "given the arguments discussed previously , regarding the maximum degree of contamination by agb gas in the formation of the second generation of stars , we must rule out such extreme chemistries , limiting the contribution from agbs to @xmath57 . in this way we obtain the dilution curve in fig .",
    "[ onacarretta ] .",
    "the observed points are reproduced within the error bars associated to the observations , with the exception of the three most extreme objects with the smallest abundances of oxygen .",
    "this comparison , though less meaningful than the previous analysis based on the abundances of aluminium and nitrogen , indicates that the hbb experienced by agb models of the same chemistry as 47 tuc stars is appropriate to provide the oxygen depletion needed to fit the observations .    a word of caution concerning the assumptions made on the chemical mixture from which the cluster formed ( i.e. the composition of fg stars ) is needed here .",
    "the results from the above analysis hold provided that the values used to build the models are correct , and that the observed data show an offset in the measured abundances .",

    "the situation is less critical for sodium , not only because the offset between our assumptions and the abundances given in @xcite is limited to a factor @xmath59 , but also because the percentage increase in the surface sodium is only marginally touched by the initial abundance : the horizontal extension of the dilution curves in both panels of fig.[carretta ] would be slightly shorter , but the conclusion drawn would remain unchanged .    as far as oxygen is concerned , the rate of destruction of this species scales with its abundance , which makes the percentage reduction independent on the assumed initial value .",
    "we do not discuss here the effects of a possible offset in the nitrogen content , because the absolute values are strongly interfaced with the assumptions concerning the initial carbon in the mixture , thus contain a high degree of arbitrariness .",

    ", we can think that the bulk of sg stars in 47 tuc has been formed by dilution of pristine gas with the agb ejecta .",
    "when the pristine gas gets consumed , the star formation may go on for a while , until type ia supernovae completely clean the cluster from gas .",
    "the stars formed in this phase would have the chemistry of the 5m@xmath2 ejecta , scarcely diluted with pristine gas .",
    "the cno enhancement of the 5m@xmath2 is 1.35 times the original cno , and the turnoff location of these stars could resemble the faint turnoff .",
    "this small population should also be helium rich , so their hb location would be among the most brilliant hb stars of 47 tuc .",
    "@xcite show indeed that a couple of their bright star groups of 47 tuc hb also have high [ na / fe ] and low [ o / fe ] .",
    "the rest of their bright sample consists of normal fg stars , probably in an evolved phase out of the hb .",
    "the analysis carried out in the previous section shows that dilution of massive agbs ejecta with gas pristine allows to reproduce the observed patterns of 47 tuc stars .",
    "this is in agreement with the scenario described by @xcite and @xcite according to which sg stars formed from a mix of agb ejecta and pristine gas driven into the cluster central regions by a cooling flow and the sg formation process is halted after @xmath60 myr by sn ia explosions .",
    "the chemistry with which sg stars form is therefore obtained by mixing processed matter with the chemical properties of the agb and sagb ejecta of stars evolving within @xmath60 myr ( i.e. for mass m@xmath1m@xmath2 , see col .  2 of table [ yields ] ) and pristine gas , with the same composition of fg stars .",

    "the fact that the gas ejected by massive agbs , for any realistic mass function , is only @xmath63 of the mass of the initial fg population implies that a significant fraction of fg stars must have been lost by the cluster . according to the simulations presented in @xcite ,",
    "this early loss of fg stars ( and the consequent increase in the fraction of sg stars ) would occur during the cluster early evolution .",
    "memory of the initial central concentration of the sg population would be preserved during this phase and would still be present in many clusters today @xcite . based on the analysis presented in @xcite , 47 tuc would be one of the clusters for which the sg should still be more concentrated in the inner regions than the fg population in agreement with what found in observational studies @xcite .",
    "following the calculation presented in @xcite and applying it to the chemical model presented here in which sg stars formed from a mix composed agb ejecta ( one third ) and pristine gas ( two thirds ) , we estimate that the total initial fg mass of 47 tuc was about 7.5 times the current cluster mass ( assuming sg stars form with masses up to about 8m@xmath2 so that there are no sg snii explosions @xcite ; the initial mass required would be smaller  about 4.5 times the current cluster mass  if one assumes a range of sg stars limited to 0.8 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the viability of a model to explain the abundance patterns defined by stars in 47 tuc on the basis of the self  enrichment scenario by massive agbs .    for this purpose ,",
    "we have specifically calculated a full set of agb and sagb models with the chemistry of 47 tuc stars , and iron content [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "agb models in the high mass ( m@xmath1m@xmath2 ) domain experience a soft hot bottom burning , producing ejecta enriched in aluminium and sodium by + 0.5 dex , and depleted in their oxygen content by @xmath40 dex .",
    "no meaningful magnesium and silicon variations are expected . similarly to other metallicities , the matter ejected is helium  rich , y@xmath52 .",
    "mixing of gas ejected by agbs with pristine gas sharing the same chemistry as the stars originally present in the cluster allows to trace abundance patterns , where sodium is correlated to nitrogen and aluminium , and anticorrelated to oxygen .",
    "based on the maximum helium enhancement allowed by the photometric analysis of the hb and the ms of the same cluster , we estimate that sg stars formed from a mix of gas composed for about one third of agb ejecta and two thirds of pristine gas . using this constrain",
    ", we can fit the extension and the slopes of the various trends observed , provided that only stars with mass m@xmath1m@xmath2 contributed to the formation of the second generation .",
    "this implies that the sg population formed formed within @xmath60 myr , before the sn ia explosions prevented further star formation .",
    "based on this analysis , and from the observed fraction of sg stars , @xmath64 of the total stellar population , we estimate that 47 tuc was initially about 7.5 times more massive than now ( or 4.5 times for sg star formation limited to 0.8 m@xmath2 ) and that a large fraction of its initial fg population must have been lost during the cluster early evolution .",
