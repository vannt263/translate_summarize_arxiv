    "the greatest observational capability of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has been providing us a lot of invaluable information on the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , williams et al .",

    "; cowie , hu , & songaila 1995 ; van dokkum et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , massive and clusters of galaxies have been also used as natural gravitational telescopes to investigate properties of high-@xmath1 galaxies [ smail et al . 1996 ; colley , tyson , & turner 1996 , franx et al .",
    "1997 ; soucail et al .",
    "1999 ( hereafter s99 ) ; pllo et al .",
    "1999 ; bzecourt et al .",
    "1999 ] .    since optical observations of high-@xmath1 galaxies",
    "probe their redshifted ultraviolet radiation , we must be careful in interpreting the data because active star - forming regions may be selectively shown up , making often galaxy morphology knotty or irregular ( bohlin et al . 1990 ; giavalisco et al . 1996 ; hibbard & vacca 1997 ) .",
    "however , on one hand , it seems likely that young galaxies have more chaotic morphological properties because they are dynamically younger than present - day galaxies .",
    "for example , galaxies with chain - like morphology have been found in _ hst _",
    "deep images ( cowie et al . 1995 ; van den bergh et al .",
    "1996 ; abraham 1997 ; bunker et al .",
    "2000 ; taniguchi & shioya 2001 ) .",
    "it is also mentioned that more frequent collisions between / among galaxies ( or subgalactic building blocks ) result in peculiar morphology of high-@xmath1 galaxies ( e.g. , van den bergh et al . 1996 ) .    among galaxies with peculiar morphologies ,",
    "one interesting object is a ring - like galaxy at @xmath3 ( lrg j0239@xmath00134 ) found as an optical counterpart of the 850 @xmath4 m source , smm j02399@xmath00134 ( smail et al .",
    "1998 : s99 ) .",
    "such ring galaxies are not so rare in the local universe and their formation mechanism is now well known ; the axial penetration of a smaller companion galaxy to a disk galaxy ( theys & spiegel 1976 , 1977 ; lynds & toomre 1976 ; appleton & marston 1997 and references therein ) . therefore , if lrg j0239@xmath00134 is a ring galaxy , it would have a less - luminous companion galaxy .",
    "although two galaxies are close to lrg j0239@xmath00134 ( see figure 1 ) , one of them , # 32 in mellier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , belongs to the cluster of galaxies abell 370 ( @xmath5 ) and the other galaxy a in s99 , or l4 in barger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , has a redshift of 0.42 .",
    "thus , these two galaxies have no relation to lrg j0239@xmath00134 . although another two very faint objects ( b and c in figure 1 ) are also seen to the south of lrg j0239@xmath00134 , they appear too faint to be a colliding partner .",
    "the most probable candidate for the colliding partner seems an object seen just to the north of the main body of lrg j0239@xmath00134 ( d in figure 1 ) although we can not rule out the possibility that this object might not be separate from the main body of lrg j0239 - 1034 . however , there is no spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "hence it seems still uncertain whether or not lrg j0239@xmath00134 is a _ usual _ ring galaxy made by the axial penetration of a companion galaxy . in this letter",
    ", we propose an alternative idea that the ring - like morphology is attributed to a pair of superbubbles driven by the intense starburst in the central region of this galaxy .",
    "s99 reported the detailed observational properties of lrg j0239@xmath00134 . since this galaxy is magnified and distorted by the gravitational shear induced by the cluster abell 370 and the nearby elliptical galaxy # 32 , they made source reconstruction of lrg j0239@xmath00134 . in their model , the magnification factor is derived as @xmath6 but it varies from 2.1 to 3.6 depending on the distance to the galaxy # 32 .",
    "following s99 , we adopt a hubble constant @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , a deceleration @xmath9 , and a cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath11-band absolute luminosity is @xmath12 .",
    "the ring - like feature has an intrinsic radius of @xmath13 kpc .",
    "its major - to - minor axis ratio is @xmath14 .",
    "if the ring is a circular one , the axial ratio suggests that the inclination angle is @xmath15 .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) luminosity at @xmath16 m is @xmath17 , being ten times as luminous as that of the cartwheel galaxy which is one of well - known ring galaxies in the local universe ( charmandaris et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "s99 made optical spectroscopy and detected two emission lines , [ o ii]@xmath183727 and [ ne v]@xmath183426 .",
    "another emission feature is marginally identified as [ ne iii]@xmath183869 .",
    "these emission - line properties suggest that lrg j0239@xmath00134 has an active galactic nucleus .",
    "recently , x ray ( 0.3  7 kev ) emission has been detected by _",
    "chandra _ from this galaxy ( bautz et al .",
    "bautz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated the unobscured x - ray luminosity , @xmath19 and found that the x - ray to submm flux ratio is similar to that of ngc 6240 which is one of luminous infrared galaxies harboring an active galactic nucleus ( e.g. , iwasawa 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "stellar continuum emission is dominated by the central body of lrg j0239@xmath00134 . since",
    "balmer lines ( h@xmath20 , h@xmath21 , h8 , and h9 ) and mg ii are observed as absorption , it is suggested that a and/or b type stars are dominant stellar sources in the central body .",
    "they are often interpreted as evidence for poststarburst ( e.g. , taniguchi et al . 1996 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1999 ; taniguchi , shioya , & murayama 2000 ) .",
    "s99 noted that [ o ii]@xmath183727 emission is spatially extended , suggesting that a part of the ring - like feature is also an emission - line region . there is no significant velocity difference between the extended emission and the central body emission ( @xmath22 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "since [ ne v]@xmath183426 does not show such an extended feature , the extended [ o ii ] emission - line region is perhaps photoionized by newly formed massive stars in the ring .",
    "finally we mention that there is an evident dark lane along the major axis of the central body ; however , we would like to note that the dark - lane hypothesis may be weakened if object d belongs to the main body of lrg j0239@xmath00134 .",
    "first we give a summary of supporting evidence for a superbubble model .",
    "1 ) the poststarburst nature in the central body suggests that a burst of supernova explosions could occur at least @xmath2 yr ago .",
    "2 ) the dark lane seen in the central body suggests that we observe this object from a nearly edge - on view .",
    "note that we would see this object from a nearly face - on view if the ring - like feature is a really ring . and",
    ", 3 ) the ring - like morphology in the raw image of s99 is not inconsistent with an idea that it is a pair of superbubbles .",
    "indeed , the figure 8-shaped morphology in the raw image of s99 looks quite similar to that of arp 220 ( see heckman , armus , & miley 1987 ) .",
    "now we apply the superbubble model ( mccray & snow 1979 ; koo & mckee 1992a , 1992b ; heckman et al . 1996 ; shull 1995 ; see also for a review on observational properties of nearby superwinds , heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ) to the case of lrg j0239@xmath00134 .",
    "here it is noted that we ignore the effect of gravity for simplicity .",
    "the radius of the superbubble ( i.e. , shocked shells ) at time @xmath23 ( in units of @xmath24 yr ) is then    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the mechanical luminosity released collectively from the supernovae in the central starburst in units of @xmath27 ergs s@xmath8 and @xmath28 is the average hydrogen number density of the ism , assumed constant in units of 1 @xmath29 ; this average density is obtained by assuming that the hydrogen gas with a mass of @xmath30 is distributed uniformly in a sphere with a radius of 10 kpc .",
    "the inferred infrared luminosity of lrg j0239@xmath00134 [ a few times @xmath31 under @xmath32 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath33 ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) : see section 3.1 ] is nearly comparable to those of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) such as arp 220 . for arp 220 , one of the well - known superwind galaxies , heckman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derived @xmath34 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we have adopted this value as a fiducial one , radius @xmath35 10 kpc and @xmath36 @xmath29 ( see saito 1979 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) , we expect @xmath37 stars that explode as supernovae . since most of these massive stars might be formed during the first 0.5 gyr (= @xmath38 ) , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total energy of a single supernova ( @xmath41 erg ) and @xmath42 is the efficiency of the kinetic energy deposited to the ambient gas ( @xmath43 0.1 ; dyson & williams 1980 ) . ] .",
    "it is also noted that the luminosity dependence is fairly weak ; i.e. , @xmath44 .    using the observed ring radius , @xmath13 kpc",
    ", we estimate the age of the superbubble is @xmath45 yr .",
    "since the elapsed time from the onset of the starburst exceeds @xmath46 yr , balmer absorption dominates over balmer emission and thus the balmer lines are observed as absorption lines ( e.g. , taniguchi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this appears consistent with the observation .",
    "the expansion velocity of the superbubble at time @xmath23 ( in units of @xmath24 yr ) is    @xmath47    using @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49 km s@xmath8 .",
    "since we assume that the ring - like feature is a pair of superbubbles , we see mostly the tangential section of the superbubbles .",
    "therefore , their velocity may be nearly the same as that of the systemic velocity of the central body .",
    "even if we observe some expanding blobs along the line of sight , the above shock velocity seems too slow to be detected in low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the superbubble model discussed here treats the spherical symmetric case for simplicity .",
    "however , actual galaxies may have oblate spheroidal isopotential surfaces to some extent even when they are in a forming phase .",
    "in such a case , the superbubble will blow out along the minor axis of the galaxy ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; de young & heckman 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that a pair of superbubbles can be formed toward the two polar directions .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in figure 2 .    in the context of the superbubble model ,",
    "the ring - like feature could originally consist of gas clouds .",
    "however , as described in taniguchi , trentham , & ikeuchi ( 1999 ) , star clusters may form as pressure - confined condensations in a shell ( or a bubble ) . therefore ,",
    "the ring - like feature can be seen in the optical continuum emission as well as in the line emission arising from nebulae photoionized by newly formed massive stars .",
    "star formation in young galaxies ( e.g. , an initial starburst ) is expected to be much more intense than typical nuclear starbursts in the local universe .",
    "further , the central starburst region in young galaxies may still be surrounded by a lot of gas .",
    "hence , any effects of superbubbles must be much more serious in such young galaxies than in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "photometric data from rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) to mir of lrg j0239@xmath00134 were obtained by s99 .",
    "in addition to these data , barger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported its 850 @xmath4 m flux , 11 mjy . using these data",
    ", we investigate the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of lrg j0239@xmath00134 .",
    "the sed is shown in figure 3 together with those of ngc 6240 ( griffith et al .",
    "1995 ; lisenfeld et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ; klaas et al . 1997 ; spinoglio et al . 1995 ; white & becker 1992 ) and arp 220 ( rigopoulou , lawrence , & rowan - robinson 1996 ; klaas et al .",
    "1997 ) . as shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the sed of lrg j0239@xmath00134 is much similar to that of ngc 6240 than to that of arp 220 .",
    "this makes sense because ngc 6240 harbors a luminous active galactic nucleus while arp 220 may not .",
    "fitting the two seds of ngc 6240 and arp 220 to the observed sed of lrg j0239@xmath00134 , we obtain the total ir luminosity between 8 @xmath4 m and 1000 @xmath4 m , @xmath50(8 - 1000@xmath4 m ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ; in the case of @xmath53 , @xmath50(8 - 1000@xmath4 m ) @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .    for nearby starburst galaxies including some local uligs , mouri et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found a relation of @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fir luminosity derived from rest - frame 60 @xmath4 m and 100 @xmath4 m fluxes ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . using the observed @xmath58 ( s99 )",
    ", we would obtain @xmath59 .",
    "however , from the sed fitting , we obtain @xmath60 at most , being lower by a factor of five than the above expected value .",
    "although the sed concordance between high-@xmath1 submm sources and local uligs has been claimed ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; see also trentham 2000 ) , it is suggested that lrg j0239@xmath00134 is a different population from local _ starburst - dominated _ uligs though its ir luminosity is comparable to those of the uligs ( appleton & struck - marcell 1987 ) , being much fainter than that of lrg j0239@xmath00134 . on the other hand , they have ring radii of 20 - 40 kpc ( appleton & struck - marcell 1987 ) , being significantly larger than that of lrg j0239@xmath00134 . ] .",
    "we have presented our superbubble model for the unusual ring - like galaxy lrg j0239@xmath00134 at @xmath3 .",
    "all pieces of supporting evidence for the superbubble model seem circumstantial .",
    "however , if this is the case , this galaxy provides an important example of the superwind activity at high redshift .",
    "similar examples may be the extended ly@xmath61 blobs ( labs ) at @xmath62 found by steidel et al .",
