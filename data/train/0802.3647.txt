    "<S> low temperature ( 10k ) high voltage bias dynamic conductivity ( up to 2.7v ) and shot noise ( up to 1v ) were studied in epitaxial fe(100)/fe - c / mgo(100)/fe(100 ) magnetic tunnel junctions , as a function of the magnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> the junctions show large tunnel magnetoresistance ( 185% at 300k and 330% at 4k ) . </S>",
    "<S> multiple sign inversion of the magnetoresistance is observed for bias polarity when the electrons scan the electronic structure of the bottom fe - c interface . </S>",
    "<S> the shot - noise shows a poissonian character . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a pure spin dependent direct tunneling mechanism and validates the high structural quality of the mgo barrier .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs)@xcite are nowadays one of the most active areas of material science and spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical predictions@xcite and experimental demonstration@xcite of coherent spin - dependent tunneling in single crystal fe(100)/mgo(100)/fe(100 ) mtjs revolutionized this area providing new ways to create devices with room temperature tunneling magneto - resistance ( rt - tmr ) exceeding 100% . </S>",
    "<S> the large tmr at low bias is mostly due to fully spin polarized @xmath0 bulk electron states in fe(001 ) , reflected for antiparrallel ferromagnetic electrodes configuration ( ap ) or well transmitted for the parallel ( p ) state@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tunneling mechanism gets more complex when taking into account the electronic structure of the interfaces@xcite and when biasing the junction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for finite bias polarities the antiparallel conductance may exceed the parallel one , resulting in tmr suppression@xcite or its sign reversal@xcite . by engineering the chemical and electronic structure of the fe / mgo interface , </S>",
    "<S> the voltage variation of the tmr in amplitude and sign can be skilfully manipulated . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently demonstrated that the carbon - doping of the bottom fe / mgo interface leads to strongly asymmetric tmr vs bias , providing a root for creation of high - output voltage device applications@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our letter presents a first study of dynamical conductance and tmr in a large bias window , up to 2.7 v , for fe(100)/fe - c / mgo(100)/fe(100 ) mtjs . the shot noise analysis in different magnetization configuration </S>",
    "<S> is performed at voltages up to 1v . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are done at room temperature ( 300k ) and low temperature ( 4k-10k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured tmr ratio increases from 185% at 300k to 330% at 4k , mostly due to the strong temperature variation of the tunnel conductivity in the antiparallel ( ap ) state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our tunneling spectroscopy experiments show a clear maximum in the ap conductivity for a finite bias and a multiple tmr sign inversion . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments demonstrate the role of the minority spin fe interface resonance state ( irs ) to the tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in both parallel ( p ) and antiparallel magnetization configuration , the shot noise measurements demonstrate an uncorrelated direct tunneling mechanism across the mgo barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise analysis and the large breakdown voltage of the junctions ( up to 3v ) demonstrates the high quality of our mgo barriers ( i.e. absence of defects such as oxygen vacancies ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our epitaxial fe(45nm)/ mgo(3nm)/ fe(10nm)/ co(20nm)/ pd(10nm)/ au(10 nm ) samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on mgo(100 ) substrates under uhv condition ( @xmath1 mbar base pressure ) . </S>",
    "<S> different coercive field of the mtj electrodes is obtained by hardening the top bcc fe electrode with hcp co epitaxially grown with in - plane c axis . </S>",
    "<S> prior to deposition , the substrate is annealed at @xmath2 , then the layers are grown at room temperature . for flattening , </S>",
    "<S> the fe electrodes are annealed to @xmath3 ( bottom fe ) and @xmath4 ( top fe ) . following the growth procedure@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> two different samples can be grown : samples with clean fe / mgo bottom interfaces and samples with carbon doping at bottom fe / mgo interface ( fe / fe - c / mgo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) analysis performed on each layer of the mtj stack allows a direct control of the epitaxial growth and the high crystalline quality of the epitaxial layers . within the pseudomorphical growth regime , </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional layer - by - layer growth of the mgo barrier is monitored by the intensity oscillations in the rheed patterns . </S>",
    "<S> compared to clean samples , in the samples with carbon the bottom fe(001 ) electrode presents a @xmath5 surface reconstruction , as shown by the rheed picture ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . after the growth of the multilayer stack , mtjs with micrometric lateral size have been patterned using standard optical lithography/ ion etching process . </S>",
    "<S> all the mtjs studied here contain carbon doped fe / mgo interface . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown a large voltage stability , up to 3 volts .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamic conductance @xmath6 and shot - noise bias dependence have been studied using four - probe method with a set - up allowing to vary the temperature between 2 and 300k , equipped with preamplifiers situated on top of the cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> two different techniques were employed to measure dynamic conductance in p or ap states , providing nearly identical results . </S>",
    "<S> the first one uses a current - voltage ( @xmath7 ) converter and a voltage amplifier . in this case , the mtj is biased using a constant _ dc _ voltage with superimposed low amplitude sinusoidal wave ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage drop on the junctions and the current were obtained by using an analogue - digital converter ( adc ) and a lock - in amplifier , providing the dynamic conductance . </S>",
    "<S> the second technique , mainly employed at high bias , uses square current wave of current superimposed on _ dc _ current . </S>",
    "<S> shot noise measurements were done using a cross - correlation technique . </S>",
    "<S> more details of experimental setup were published elsewhere@xcite .    at 300k , </S>",
    "<S> the fe / fe - c / mgo(3nm)/fe / co mtjs show @xmath9 product values ( rt ) ranging from 0.42 to 0.48 m@xmath10.@xmath11@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in the top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows typical tmr curves measured at 10mv either at 300k and at 4k . </S>",
    "<S> the large tmr ratio of 185% at 300k indicates the high quality of the mtjs . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the low temperature tmr ( @xmath13 330% ) notably exceed previously reported ( 250% ) maximum values of zero - bias tmr in epitaxial fe(100)/mgo / fe mtjs with undopped fe / mgo interfaces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature variation of the tmr is understood from the dynamic conductivity experiments @xmath14 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) which plots @xmath6 at 300 and 10k within a voltage range of 0.8v . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , asymmetric g(v ) characteristics in positive and negative voltage demonstrate different electronic structure of the top and bottom electrodes and fe / mgo interfaces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we remark significantly different temperature variation of conductivity in p and ap magnetization configurations . in the ap configuration ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) bottom panel ) , we remark almost no temperature dependent shape variation , except the enhancement of low bias anomaly at 10k . </S>",
    "<S> however , we notice a strong reduction of @xmath15 by 50% at low temperature . on the other hand , a net temperature dependent shape variation between 300k and 10k ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) top panel ) is clearly seen for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the zero bias @xmath17 is mostly constant with temperature ( only 2% variation ) . </S>",
    "<S> additional local minima appear at 10k for both positive and negative finite bias voltage . at low temperature , </S>",
    "<S> all studied mtjs reveal novel p - state low - bias conductance oscillations with about 4 minima ( top panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that low - bias conductivity minima in the p state have been already observed in carbon free samples even at 300k . </S>",
    "<S> however , we always measured only two local conductance minima@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these minima were explained by the @xmath18 majority electron contribution to the total conductivity at low voltage ( @xmath19 which is the top of the majority @xmath18 band ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of low temperature @xmath16 minima observed in fe / fe - c / mgo / fe mtjs opens interesting theoretical perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations should investigate in detail the effect of the realistic electronic structure of the fe / fe - c / mgo ( i.e. effects of fe - c bounding ) on the tunneling , in the low bias regime .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(a ) presents high bias conductance for voltages up to 2.7v , measured at 10k . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of joule heating ( few k ) on the @xmath20 is neglected due to the rather weak observed low temperature temperature dependence of both @xmath17 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , while @xmath22 is rather symmetric , in negative voltage when the electrons tunnel into the bottom fe - c / mgo electrode , the @xmath15 shows a strong asymmetric local maximum superimposed on roughly parabolic background . </S>",
    "<S> this local resonant increase of the @xmath21 ( @xmath23 ) in a narrow@xcite energy window will lead to the lower voltage sign reversal of the tmr ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , bottom panel).similar to scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments@xcite , and as we already previously shown@xcite , the resonant enhancement of @xmath21 is attributed to the contribution to the tunneling of the fe minority interfacial resonance ( irs ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we only observed this phenomena in carbon free fe / mgo / fe samples with thinner mgo barrier , where the fe irs still significantly contribute to the tunneling@xcite . in the samples studied here , having carbon at the fe - c / mgo interface , an important effect of the @xmath21 resonant activation by irs </S>",
    "<S> is observed even for 3 nm thick mgo barriers . to elucidate this interesting property , theoretical investigation of two effects </S>",
    "<S> is in progress : ( i ) the effect of fe - c - mgo bounding on the minority spin fe(001 ) irs ( i.e. shift in energy , dispersion in k ) ; ( ii ) the carbon induced periodical perturbation of the potential at the bottom fe / mgo interface ( i.e. @xmath5 reconstruction , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) induces scattering events which change k - vector . </S>",
    "<S> this has direct consequences on the total conductivity .    in positive bias , </S>",
    "<S> when electrons are injected toward the top electrode , the low bias tmr changes the sign above 1.5v . </S>",
    "<S> this is determined by the @xmath21 strong enhancement when , in the ap configuration the injected @xmath0 electrons from the bottom fe electrode arrive as hot electrons in the top electrode and find an equivalent symmetry in the minority band . in negative voltage , when electrons tunnel into the bottom fe - c / mgo electrode , similar contribution of the minority @xmath0 symmetry to the conductivity is expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tmr second sign reversal seems to appear at much higher voltages , above 2.5v ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , bottom panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason would be the reduction of the hot electrons thermalization length in the bottom electrode . the effect of the irs at fe - c / mgo interface on this phenomena requires further theoretical investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(b ) presents shot noise measurements carried out at t = 10k on fe / fe - c / mgo / fe mtjs , with bias direction corresponding to injection of electrons from the top to the bottom ( carbon doped ) fe / mgo interface . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves shows the theoretical expectation for the shot noise , for electron tunneling having poissonian character : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the dynamic conductivity ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) and @xmath26 the applied current . within the error bars , </S>",
    "<S> showing dispersion of the shot noise white spectrum in the khz range , the experimental data clearly indicate the absence of electron correlations and/or sequential tunneling phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that both p and ap spin dependent conductance s and the shot noise are due to direct tunneling between electron bands , as expected for the coherent tunneling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of resonant assisted tunneling in the shot noise demonstrates the high quality of our epitaxial mgo barriers ( i.e. the absence of oxygen vacancies ) . </S>",
    "<S> this high quality is furthermore confirmed by the large breakdown voltage of the mtjs ( up to 3v ) .    </S>",
