    "instabilities of  stable \" nuclei against exotic cluster decays were first studied by one of us ( rkg ) and collaborators @xcite for the neutron - deficient @xmath4xe , @xmath5ba , @xmath6ce , @xmath7nd , @xmath8sm , and @xmath9gd and neutron - rich @xmath10ba , @xmath11ce , @xmath12nd , @xmath13sm , and @xmath14gd nuclei , on the basis of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of malik and gupta @xcite ( see , also the works of other authors @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath15 , @xmath16-nuclei @xmath17be , @xmath1c , @xmath18o , @xmath19ne , @xmath20 mg , and @xmath21si are predicted to be the most probable emitters from neutron - deficient parents , with a much smaller decay half - life compared to @xmath22 clusters predicted preferably or observed from neutron - rich parents ( e.g. , @xmath23c from @xmath10ba or @xmath24ra with @xmath25sn or @xmath26pb as daughter , respectively ) .",
    "thus , other than @xmath16 particle , @xmath1c decay of @xmath5ba nuclei is shown to be the most probable one with @xmath27sn and its heavier isotopes as the daughter nuclei .",
    "the ground - state decay of ba , however , could not be established as yet @xcite , and a new phenomenon of intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) with 3@xmath28z@xmath289 , also referred to as ` clusters ' or ` complex fragments ' , is observed to be emitted from the compound nucleus @xmath29ba@xmath30 formed in @xmath31ni+@xmath31ni@xmath32ba@xmath30 reactions at both the high @xcite and medium energies @xcite .",
    "the measured imf cross - section @xmath33 for the @xmath29ba@xmath30 decay at all the above mentioned medium and high energies are so far understood only on the preformed - clusters ( pcm ) based dynamical cluster - decay model ( dcm ) of one of us ( rkg ) and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the dcm describes the @xmath29ba@xmath30 data on @xmath33 reasonably well , and predicts an additional fusion - fission of @xmath29ba@xmath30 which consists of fragments at the heavy end of symmetric and near symmetric division ( 14@xmath28z@xmath2828 ) , very recently observed at ganil @xcite for the decays of @xmath34ba@xmath35 nuclei produced in @xmath36kr+@xmath37ca reactions at a lower incident energy , and also explained more recently @xcite on dcm .",
    "it should thus be interesting to see if mean - field approaches , such as the relativistic mean field model , support such a clustering structure for the ground and/ or excited states of ba nuclei .",
    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations for light nuclei @xcite have very successfully shown the @xmath38 clustering in @xmath39be , a benchmark nucleus , and the @xmath16-clustering and halo structures of ( @xmath40)-core or ( @xmath40+p)-core plus @xmath41n for the stable and exotic be and b nuclei .",
    "for the n = z , @xmath16-nuclei @xmath1c and @xmath18o , the rmf formalism gives the several known ground - state ( g.s . ) structures such as the 3@xmath16-equilateral triangle ( co - existing with spherical shape ) and 4@xmath16-tetrahedron or kite - like , plus the 3@xmath16- and 4@xmath16-linear chains for their excited states .",
    "also , both @xmath16- and non-@xmath16-cluster structures , like @xmath42b+@xmath42b , @xmath1c+@xmath1c , @xmath1c+@xmath16+@xmath1c and @xmath18o+@xmath18o , and 5-@xmath16-trigonal bipyramid and pentagonal bipyramid ( hollow sphere ) are obtained for @xmath19ne to @xmath43s nuclei , but _ no _ 5-@xmath16 , 6-@xmath16 chains , etc . , are seen .",
    "furthermore , @xmath44ni shows @xcite a preferred n = z , @xmath16-nucleus clustering for states with deformations up to hyper - deformation ( @xmath452.45 ) . similarly , for heavy actinides ( @xmath24ra , @xmath46u , @xmath47pu and @xmath48 cm ) , the rmf gives @xcite not only the n@xmath49 z , @xmath16-like clustering in the g.s . but also the exotic n@xmath50z clustering in excited states .",
    "signatures of clustering structure in rmf calculations of super - heavy z=114 and 120 , n=172 - 184 nuclei @xcite are also obtained in terms of exotic n@xmath50z clusters at the centre of their super - deformed g.s . or the clustering in to two large and some small pieces is universal for all super - deformed ground states in z=120 nuclei .",
    "the super - superheavy @xmath51u+@xmath51u@xmath52184@xmath30 nucleus also supports the clustering phenomenon , with a kind of triple fission of an exotic cluster in the neck region of two equal fragments of n = z matter @xcite .",
    "the actual internal or sub - structure structure of the clusters , however , was not determined in these calculations , which is one of the aims of the present study .",
    "taking rmf model as an established tool for the cluster structure in nuclei , in this paper we demonstrate its application to medium - heavy @xmath0ba nuclei , with an additional attempt to determine for the first time the internal structure(s ) of cluster(s ) , i.e. , the number of protons and neutrons in a cluster .",
    "the paper is so designed that section ii describes the relativistic mean field theory , and section iii gives the results obtained from our calculation .",
    "finally a brief summary and concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many - body system @xcite @xmath53    from this lagrangian we obtain the field equations for the nucleons and mesons .",
    "these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis with an initial deformation @xmath54 .",
    "the set of coupled equations is solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method . the centre - of - mass motion ( c.m . )",
    "energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula @xmath55 .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath56 is evaluated from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , as @xmath57 . the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius",
    "is defined as @xmath58 ; here @xmath59 is the mass number , and @xmath60 is the deformed density . the total binding energy and other observables are also obtained by using the standard relations , given in @xcite .",
    "we use the well known nl3 parameter set @xcite .",
    "this set reproduces the properties of stable nuclei . as outputs , we obtain different potentials , densities , single - particle energy levels , radii , quadrupole deformations and the binding energies . for a given nucleus",
    ", the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground state and other solutions are obtained as various excited intrinsic states .",
    "the density distribution of nucleons play the prominent role for studying the internal structure of a nucleus . for a different quadrupole deformation ,",
    "the density distribution @xmath61 inside the nucleus must vary .",
    "for example , the @xmath61 for a spherical nucleus is symmetrical in @xmath62plane .",
    "however , it is highly asymmetric for a largely deformed nucleus . knowing the density distribution of the spherical or ( oblate/ prolate ) deformed confuguration",
    ", we can calculate the number of nucleons for each confuguration , defined as @xmath63 with @xmath64 as number of neutrons n , protons z or mass a. though a straight forward calculation , this is being carried out here for the first time .",
    "we first calculate the potential energy surface ( pes ) by using the rmf formalism in a constrained calculation @xcite , i.e. , instead of minimizing the @xmath65 , we have minimized @xmath66 , with @xmath67 as a lagrange multiplier and @xmath68 , the quadrupole moment .",
    "the term @xmath65 is the dirac mean field hamiltonian for rmf model ( the notations are standard and its form can be seen in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "we get the constrained binding energy from @xmath69 and the free energy from @xmath70 . the converged free energy solution does not depend on the initial guess value of the basis deformation @xmath71 as long as it is nearer to the minimum in pes .",
    "however , it converges to some other local minimum when @xmath71 is drastically different , and in this way we evaluate a different intrinsic isomeric state for a given nucleus .",
    "ba and @xmath72ba nuclei , i.e , constrained binding energy ( @xmath73 ) as a function of quadrupole deformation parameter in rmf(nl3 ) calculations . ]    [ fig.1 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this subsection , we count the number of nucleons in different clusters formed inside the @xmath0ba isotopic chain , listed in the table ii .",
    "the density distributions of these clusters , obtained from the rmf(nl3 ) formalism for different solutions of deformation parameters @xmath74 from oblate to prolate confugurations , are already shown above in figs . 2 to 5 .",
    "from these distribution plots of each oblate or prolate configuration , we find the number of nucleons by using the general formula in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for not only the total nucleons ( using total density distribution of the nucleus ) but also for protons and neutrons ( using individual density distributions ) , which is listed in the table ii . for this calculation , we first find the range of the integral , i.e. , the lower and the upper limits of the axes ( r and z ) from the plots in figs . 2 to 5 , and then evaluate the integral for each case .",
    "table ii first shows that the number of protons and neutrons from the individual density distributins gives the total number of nucleons which is calculated here from the total density distribution of the nucleus for each isotope of ba with different @xmath56 solutions .",
    "secondly , the internal cluster configuration of @xmath0ba nuclei contain @xmath1c or @xmath75c as the most common cluster . for the oblate - state ( @xmath76 - 0.35 , fig .",
    "2 ) , the density distribution is uniform for @xmath77ba isotopes , but in cases of @xmath78ba isotopes we find a @xmath1c or @xmath75c cluster , and for @xmath72ba a @xmath79na cluster . the ground - state density distributions ( around @xmath800.25 , fig .",
    "3 ) of @xmath81ba contain @xmath82 cluster , but @xmath83ba contain clusters of some other elements like @xmath84li and @xmath85h .",
    "the density distributions for the prolate - state ( @xmath801.2 , fig .",
    "4 ) are again uniform for the isotopes @xmath86ba , but show @xmath17be cluster confuguration for @xmath87ba .",
    "note that there are no solutions for @xmath80 1.2 for the isotopic chain @xmath88ba .",
    "for the very large @xmath8010.5 , the internal confugurations of the isotopic chain @xmath0ba are of the form of two separated ( identical ) nuclei which are connected by a neck like confuguration .",
    "the neck confugurations contain simply the hydrogen isotopes @xmath2h or @xmath3he nucleus .",
    "as already noted in the introduction , the existence of @xmath1c cluster inside the ba nuclei has been of interest both from experimental and theoretical points of views .",
    "the important point is that @xmath1c cluster is formed inside the ba nuclei , and are not from the neck region where @xmath2h or @xmath3he nuclei are shown to exist . in other words , @xmath1c constitutes the cluster structure of ba nuclei .",
    "concluding , we have calculated the gross nuclear properties and the nucleon density distributions for the isotopic chain @xmath0ba using the deformed relativistic mean field ( rmf ) formalism with nl3 parameter set .",
    "the gross properties , like the binding energy , deformation parameter @xmath74 and the charge radius @xmath89 , show qualitative similarity between the experimental and rmf calculated values .",
    "analysing the nuclear density distributions , we get the internal or sub - structure of clusters in ba isotopes which we find to consist mostly of @xmath90c and several other clusters like @xmath85h , @xmath91li and @xmath39be . some heavier clusters of na , cl , mg , ar and ca are also obtained . with the increase of deformation ( @xmath8010 or 11 ) , the ba nucleus breaks ( fissions ) in to two symmetrical fragments , releasing from the neck region some clusters of hydrogen isotopes @xmath92 or @xmath3he .",
    "this is an interesting result of the rmf(nl3 ) technique for nuclear structure physics .",
    "clustering is also important for the decay of excited compound nuclei formed in nuclear reactions , where nuclei in the neck region could have correspondance with the measured fusion - evaporation residues consisting of light particles with @xmath932 .",
    "we know from the introduction above that todate the decay of @xmath94ba@xmath30 compound nuclei in to intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) , and symmetric and near - symmetric fission fragments are measured @xcite , but the fusion - evaporation cross - sections are not yet measured .",
