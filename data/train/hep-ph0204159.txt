    "while single particle momentum distributions give only indirect insight to the space - time evolution of the system created in high energy heavy ion collisions , the lifetime and the spatial extent of the pion source as well as the existence of collective velocity fields at the time of thermal freezeout can be probed by the study of bose - einstein momentum correlations of identical pions via hbt interferometry  @xcite .",
    "the width of the correlation peak at vanishing relative momenta reflects the so - called length of homogeneity of the pion emitting source . only in static sources can the length of homogeneity , in the following",
    "also called source radius , be interpreted as the true geometrical size of the system . in a dynamic system , the occurence of space - momentum correlations of the emitted particles due to collective expansion generally leads to a reduction of the observed source radii , depending on the strength of the expansion and the thermal velocity of the pions @xmath0 at thermal freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "a differential analysis of the hbt correlations in bins of the pair transverse momentum @xmath1=@xmath2 thus provides valuable information about the properties of the collective expansion of the system  @xcite .    to obtain most detailed information about the space - time evolution",
    "the three - momentum difference vector @xmath3 of two like - sign pions is decomposed into components , @xmath3=@xmath4 .",
    "following bertsch and pratt  @xcite , @xmath5 is the momentum difference along the beam direction , calculated in the longitudinal rest frame ( lcms ) of the pair , @xmath6 is parallel to the pair transverse momentum @xmath7 and @xmath8 is perpendicular to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the correlation function is defined as the ratio @xmath9=@xmath10 where the signal @xmath11 is the probability to find a pair with momentum difference @xmath3 in a given event and the background @xmath12 is the corresponding mixed - event distribution .",
    "the normalized correlation functions are fit by a gaussian : @xmath13    with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the gaussian source radii and @xmath17 the correlation strength .",
    "the cross - term @xmath18 appears as a consequence of space - time correlations in non - boost - invariant systems .",
    "pion hbt interferometry analyses have been performed by a number of experiments at sps  @xcite . a systematic study of the centrality dependence of hbt radii around midrapidity from pb+au collisions at all three presently available sps energies , 40 , 80 , and 158 agev , was recently presented by the ceres collaboration  @xcite .",
    "details of their analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "+    the @xmath1-dependence of the longitudinal source parameter @xmath14 is shown in fig .  1 for the three different beam energies and as function of the centrality of the collision .",
    "similar to previous studies , a strong decrease of @xmath14 with @xmath1 is observed , characteristic for a strong collective longitudinal expansion , where the length of homogeneity is entirely saturated by the thermal length scale @xmath19 . for the case of longitudinal boost - invariance , @xmath14 can be connected to the lifetime @xmath20 of the system , the time elapsed between the onset of expansion and kinetic freeze - out by @xmath14=@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the slight but systematic overall increase of @xmath14 with centrality and beam energie is reflected in a correspondingly longer lifetime when applying the above expression to the data and assuming @xmath22=120  mev ( see fits in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the observed lifetimes at the sps are 6 - 8  fm / c .",
    "+     + [ fig : rout ]    the transverse source parameter @xmath15 is closely related to the _ true _ geometrical transverse extension of the system at freeze - out .",
    "consequently , a weaker @xmath1-dependence is observed for @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating the presence of radial flow .",
    "a slight but systematic increase of @xmath15 with centrality is measured at all beam energies , as expected from simple collision geometry .",
    "the beam energy dependence is surprising : largest @xmath15 and the strongest @xmath1-dependence are observed at the lowest energy .",
    "this led previously to the conclusion that radial flow may reach a maximum at the lower sps energies  @xcite",
    ". we will discuss below that the extraction of the radial flow velocity from the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath15 at the lower sps energies might be questionable . at 158 agev ,",
    "a radial flow velocity of about 0.5@xmath23 was obtained from the analysis of single particle @xmath24-spectra and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "many authors have discussed that a strong first order phase transition with a large latent heat can lead to a retardation of hadronization during the mixed phase and consequently to a long duration of pion emission  @xcite .",
    "this should be observable via a strong increase of the outward source parameter @xmath16 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "however , no long - lived source has been observed so far . at sps , @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "3 ) is similar to @xmath15 , indicating a short pion emission duration and a sudden freeze - out .",
    "a large amount of pion interferometry data have been published by experiments at ags , sps , and rhic .",
    "this allows for a systematic study of the source parameters over a wide range of beam energies .",
    "it has been argued that the _ hbt null effect _",
    "@xcite , the absence of any beam energy dependence , in particular when going to rhic , is the actual surprising result from hbt interferometry .    in fig .",
    "4 are shown the @xmath1-dependences of @xmath14,@xmath15 , and @xmath16 in central pb(aa)+pb(au ) collisions at different beam energies  @xcite . indeed , no dramatic variation of any of the source parameters can be observed .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals some interesting features .",
    "@xmath14 is approximately constant from ags to the lower sps energies , but develops a significant increase within the sps regime and towards rhic , indicating a smooth increase of the lifetime .",
    "most interesting is the behaviour of @xmath15 : it is gradually _ decreasing _ at small @xmath1 up to top sps energy , connected with a continuous _ flattening _ of the @xmath1-dependence . at rhic , @xmath15 is again larger than at sps while the shape is not yet well measured , at least the @xmath26 sample looks rather flat .",
    "naivly , the flattening indicates a _ decrease _ of the radial flow velocity as function of beam energy , in contradiction to the present understanding  @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 shows a rather weak energy dependence , possibly indicating a shallow minimum at the lower sps energy .",
    "+ [ fig : edep ]    a straight - forward investigation of the freeze - out properties can be performed by relating the measured source parameters to an effective freeze - out volume , @xmath27=@xmath28 .",
    "assuming freeze - out at constant density  @xcite , we expect @xmath27 to scale linearly with the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "5 shows @xmath27 as function of the number of participants at 40 , 80 , and 158 agev . a linear scaling with @xmath29",
    "is indeed observed at all three energies , consistent with the assumption of a constant freeze - out density , since the number of charged particles was found to scale close to linear with @xmath29 at sps  @xcite .",
    "+     + [ fig : vol_edep ]    but the beam energy dependence is surprising : there is no clear hierarchy visible in fig .  5 as expected from the increase of multiplicity by about 50% between 40  agev and 158  agev ;",
    "the smallest @xmath27 are observed at 80 agev .",
    "obviously , the freeze - out volume scales with multiplicity as long as multiplicity is controlled via centrality , but it does not scale accordingly as multiplicity changes with beam energy .",
    "the comparison of @xmath27 at different beam energies from ags to rhic sheds some light on this : the freeze - out volume @xmath27 is gradually decreasing within the ags energy range , reaches a minimum at sps and then increases towards rhic , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "clearly , a simple relation between multiplicity and freeze - out volume can not hold . on the other hand , it is plausible to assume that at low energies pions interact mainly with nucleons , while at high energies pion - pion scattering dominates .",
    "is the transition from nucleon to pion dominated freeze - out characterized by a minimum in @xmath27 at sps ?",
    "+ [ fig : dndy ]    in fig .",
    "7  ( left ) the midrapidity density of pions  @xcite and protons  @xcite in central pb(au)+pb(au ) collisions is shown as function of @xmath30 .",
    "the pion yield increases monotonically with beam energy .",
    "the _ total _",
    "proton ( p+@xmath31 ) yield at midrapidity drops from ags to sps and stays approximately constant between sps and rhic because the decreasing number of net protons is compensated by p-@xmath31 production .",
    "the sum of pions and protons , however , is still a monotonic function of @xmath30 .    at this point ,",
    "the different cross sections @xmath32 and @xmath33 have to be considered . in fig .",
    "7  ( upper right ) the cross section weighted sum of pions and protons @xmath34=@xmath35 + @xmath36 is shown .",
    "for the cross sections @xmath32=10  mb and @xmath33=65  mb are assumed . indeed , the cross section weighted sum of pions and nucleons at midrapidity is _ non_-monotonic and exhibits a minimum at sps . as a consequence , the ratio @xmath37 , which has the dimension of a length , is approximately constant ( fig .  7 ,  lower right ) .",
    "this result suggests @xmath37@xmath381  fm as a universal freeze - out condition . in this picture , the relatively weak beam energy dependence of hbt source parameters can be understood as an interplay between the decreasing ( and eventually levelling off ) ( p+@xmath31 ) yield and the increasing pion multiplicity at midrapidity , if their different cross sections with pions are taken into account .",
    "it is interesting to obtain a detailed understanding of the role of protons for pion freeze - out at low energies .",
    "the strong momentum dependence of the @xmath33 cross section may affect the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath15 at low beam energies and cause the flattening of the @xmath1-dependence with increasing beam energy , as the importance of protons ceases . at the lower sps energies , where protons are still important",
    ", the interpretation of the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath15 in terms of radial flow may be questionable , and possibly breaks down at ags .",
    "single particle spectra and azimuthal anisotropies at sps and rhic have been well reproduced by state - of - the - art hydro+cascade calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , they fail to reproduce the measured hbt parameters , in particular the lifetime of the system is grossly overestimated .    in these models ,",
    "the early plasma phase is described by hydrodynamics assuming an ideal plasma eos with a first order phase transition and a mixed phase with an adjustable latent heat . at the end of the mixed phase ,",
    "hadrons are created assuming a thermal phase space population superimposed by the collective velocity field created by the plasma pressure .",
    "after hadronization , hadrons are rescattered using a hadronic cascade code .    in @xcite the response of the hydro+cascade calculation to different choices of the latent heat",
    "is well documented . from this investigation ,",
    "it becomes obvious that the choice of a relatively large latent heat of 0.8  gev/@xmath39 , needed to describe the sps single particle data , is mainly driven by the observed mass dependence of the inverse slope parameters .",
    "smaller latent heat produces larger flow velocities _ before _ hadronization and therefore too hard spectra , in particular for the multi - strange baryons which do not follow the linear scaling behaviour observed for @xmath40 , k , p  @xcite . on the other hand , a small latent heat would lead to an early acceleration of the matter and therefore to a faster dilution and shorter lifetime , in particular of the hadronic phase , which is suggested by the hbt measurements .",
    "this leads to a closer inspection of the data as represented in fig .",
    "8 ( left ) .",
    "for some of the particle species , the observed inverse slope parameter scales linearly with the particle mass , consistent with the assumption of a common flow velocity .",
    "there are , however , a number of exceptions which do not follow this rule ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "this was explained by their small cross sections with the surrounding matter , hence they are expected to participate less in the collective motion .",
    "on the other hand , it is evident that the data separate into two groups : all mesons have similar slopes , and the same is true for baryons .",
    "one may therefore as well correlate the inverse slope with the number of constituent quarks inside the hadron , rather than with the hadron mass ( fig .",
    "8 , right ) . also here",
    "a scaling behaviour can be observed , and almost all particles are consistent with this trend .",
    "note that the large inverse slope of the @xmath41 observed by na49  @xcite is experimentally still under debate , since there is also a measurement by na50  @xcite , giving a much smaller number .    the physical picture which arises from this representation is different from the common interpretation : collective motion has completely developed _ before _ hadronization , with constituent quarks being the flowing objects .",
    "hadrons are formed by coalescence of constituent quarks , preferentially if they are close in phase space , thereby adding their momenta .",
    "when hadrons acquire mass , momentum is conserved which leaves the momentum spectra unchanged . in this picture , the data are consistent with a kinetic freeze - out temperature of 0.12  gev , a collective quark flow velocity of @xmath44 and an effective quark mass of 0.33  gev : @xmath45=@xmath46 ( dashed line in fig .  8 ,",
    "most of the explosive power of the system would be assigned to the early , pre - hadronic phase of the collision , thereby qualitatively explaining the short lifetimes observed by hbt .",
    "it also suggests that the hadronic mass scale is no more relevant in the early phase of the collision , as naively expected for a deconfined partonic system .",
