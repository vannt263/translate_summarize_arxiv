    "recently , the dirac electron in solid state has been investigated intensively [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "it is interesting to examine how the kondo effect occurs in a system of dirac electrons with magnetic impurities .",
    "it is not so trivial whether the kondo effect indeed appears there .",
    "we expect significant and interesting behaviors when the localized spin interacts with the dirac electron through the s - d interaction .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian resembles the s - d model with the spin - orbit coupling of rashba type [ 7 ] . in this paper",
    "we investigate the s - d hamiltonian with dirac electrons by means of the green s function theory and evaluate the kondo temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8\\\\ h_{sd}&= & -\\frac{j}{2}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{{\\bf k}{\\bf k } ' } [ s_z(c_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow}^{\\dag}c_{{\\bf k}'\\uparrow}- c_{{\\bf k}\\downarrow}^{\\dag}c_{{\\bf k}'\\downarrow } ) + s_{+}c_{{\\bf k}\\downarrow}^{\\dag}c_{{\\bf k}'\\uparrow } + s_{-}c_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow}^{\\dag}c_{{\\bf k}'\\downarrow}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath9 and @xmath10 are velocities of conduction electrons , @xmath6 is the chemical potential and @xmath11 is the mass of the dirac fermion .",
    "@xmath12 indicates the number of sites .",
    "we set @xmath13 so that the chemical potential @xmath6 includes @xmath11 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the operators of the localized spin .",
    "the term @xmath19 indicates the s - d interaction between the conduction electrons and the localized spin , with the coupling constant @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is negative , as adopted in this paper , for the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "we define thermal green s functions of the conduction electrons @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the time ordering operator .",
    "we note that the spin operators satisfy the following relations : @xmath23    we also define green s functions which include the localized spins as well as the conduction electron operators .",
    "they are for example , following the notation of zubarev @xcite , @xmath24 the fourier transforms are defined as usual : @xmath25    using the commutation relations the equation of motion for @xmath26 reads @xmath27 here we have defined @xmath28 the equation of motion for @xmath29 is also obtained in a similar way . by using the decoupling procedure for green s functions [ 11 - 13 ] , we can obtain a closed solution for a set of green s functions .",
    "the green s function @xmath26 is obtained as @xmath30 where the analytic continuation @xmath31 is carried out .",
    "we defined the following functions : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "from the green s function @xmath26 , the kondo temperature @xmath4 is determined from a zero of the denominator in this formula .",
    "we consider @xmath35 in the limit @xmath36 by neglecting higher - order term being proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "let us adopt for simplicity that @xmath38 and then the dispersion is @xmath39 in three dimensions .",
    "we neglect the term of the order of @xmath20 in @xmath40 .",
    "the equation @xmath41 results in the kondo temperature @xmath4 given as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a cutoff and @xmath44 is euler s constant .",
    "we assumed that @xmath45 is small , @xmath46 and @xmath47 to derive the above formula , where @xmath48 is the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the result shows that the kondo effect indeed occurs in a dirac system .",
    "we can consider the kondo effect in two dimensions by setting @xmath49 , and also the @xmath50-dimensional case in general . in @xmath50 dimensions",
    "@xmath4 reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the solid angle in @xmath50-dimensional space , namely , the area of the @xmath53-sphere @xmath54 .    in the limit @xmath55 , the equation @xmath41 has no solution .",
    "hence , when @xmath56 is small , @xmath4 is reduced and vanishes .",
    "this measn that , when the fermi surface is point like , the kondo effect and thus the kondo screening never appears because of the weak scattering by the localized spin .",
    "when @xmath56 is small , @xmath57 , @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath56 : @xmath58    when @xmath45 is large being of order o(1 ) or more than that , @xmath4 will show an algebraic dependence on @xmath56 . @xmath4 reads , being proportional to @xmath56 , @xmath59 up to the order of @xmath60 where we put @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the riemann zeta function at argument 3 .",
    "we investigated the s - d hamiltonian with the localized spin interacting with the dirac fermions .",
    "the green s function method is applied to examine a singularity in green s functions to determine the kondo temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the singularity leads to the formula of @xmath4 as usual being proportional to @xmath63 with the density of states @xmath64 .",
    "the kondo effect indeed occurs in the band of dirac fermions and will produce singular properties in physical quantities .",
    "@xmath4 vanishes when the fermi surface is point like .",
    "the term being proportional to @xmath65 like the magnetic field , which we did not have considered in this paper , is also important in the kondo effect .",
    "it is also interesting to study the nature of interaction between two magnetic impurities in dirac metals .",
    "this issue was investigated intensively in the original kondo problem@xcite .",
