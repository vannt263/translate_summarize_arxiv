    "monte carlo techniques for geophysical inversion were first used about forty years ago , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . since",
    "then there has been considerable advances in both computer technology and mathematical methodology , and therefore an increasing interest in those methods .",
    "some examples can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is a class of problems where the  number of unknowns is one of the unknowns \" . for these problems ,",
    "a number of frameworks have been developed since the mid-1990s to extend the fixed - dimension markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to encompass trans - dimensional stochastic simulation . among these trans - dimensional schemes ,",
    "the reversible jump markov chain sampling algorithm proposed by @xcite is certainly the most well understood and well developed .",
    "a survey of the state of the art on trans - dimensional markov chain monte carlo can be found in @xcite .",
    "trans - dimensional mcmc has been successfully applied to geophysical models , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a rj - mcmc algorithm to detect the shape of a geophysical object underneath the earth surface from gravity anomaly data , assuming a two - dimensional polygonal model for the object .",
    "although the idea of @xcite can in principle be extended to three - dimensional cases with polygons replaced by polyhedrons , in practice much numerical difficulties could be encountered .",
    "what is more , an arbitrary three - dimensional real object can not always be presented by a simple polyhedron .",
    "another limitation of the development in @xcite is that it is not trivial to extend the model to multiple objects .",
    "the present paper is the first attempt to invert a three - dimensional magnetic dipole field using rj - mcmc .",
    "consider an arbitrary magnetic dipole @xmath0 with magnitude @xmath1 and unit vector @xmath2 , located at @xmath3 , the magnetic field at an arbitrary point @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the magnetic permeability of free space .",
    "consider @xmath8 dipoles , each denoted as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and located at @xmath11 and with a strength @xmath12 and a direction unit vector @xmath13 .",
    "assume @xmath14 measurement locations at @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 .",
    "then the magnetic field at @xmath18 due to dipole @xmath9 is given by @xmath19 , and the total magnetic field at measurement point @xmath18 induced by all the @xmath8 dipoles is given by @xmath20 the observed magnetic field at @xmath18 is @xmath21 .",
    "assuming an independent gaussian noise with standard deviation @xmath22 in each of the measured components , the likelihood function is then @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the model , with each dipole @xmath9 having six parameters @xmath25 representing its direction , strength and location .",
    "the first two parameters @xmath26 are the spherical polar coordinates of the unit vector for the dipole , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29**. * *    in a geophysical context , the object creating the magnetic anomaly could be represented by a collection of dipoles with the same orientation @xmath30 and the same strength @xmath1 . in such a case",
    "the parameter vector for a collection of @xmath8 dipoles is @xmath31 , i.e. there are only @xmath32 parameters for the model of @xmath8 dipoles .",
    "we now describe a reversible jump mcmc algorithm for the dipole model .",
    "first , we describe the within - model moves where the number of dipoles is fixed at @xmath8 , i.e. there are no birth nor death moves .",
    "the metropolis - hastings algorithm was first described by @xcite as a generalization of the metropolis algorithm , @xcite .",
    "denote the state vector for the model of @xmath8 dipoles as @xmath33 at step @xmath34 the state vector @xmath35 and we wish to update it to a new state @xmath36 .",
    "we generate a candidate @xmath37 from candidate generating density @xmath38 , we then accept this point as the new state of the chain with probability @xmath39 given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the likelihood given by ( 3 ) , @xmath42 is the prior density . if the proposal is accepted , we let the new state @xmath43 , otherwise @xmath44 .",
    "it is often more efficient to partition the state variable @xmath45 into components and update these components one by one .",
    "this was the framework for mcmc originally proposed by metropolis et al .",
    "( 1953 ) , and it is used in this work . for each component @xmath46 , we take the normal density as the proposal density @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the normal density with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath49 .",
    "a sensible choice for the @xmath49 values is to let @xmath50 for the two common polar coordinates , @xmath51 for the common magnetic strength , and @xmath52 for all the position coordinates .",
    "the reversible jump markov chain monte carlo proposed by @xcite provides a framework for constructing reversible markov chain samplers that jump between parameter spaces of different dimensions , thus permitting exploration of joint parameter and model probability space via a single markov chain .",
    "as shown by @xcite , detailed balance is satisfied if the proposed move from @xmath53 to @xmath54 is accepted with probability @xmath55 , with @xmath56 given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability that a proposed jump from @xmath53 to @xmath54 is attempted , @xmath59 is a proposal density , and @xmath60 is the jacobian of the deterministic mapping .",
    "efficiency of rj - mcmc depends on the choice of mapping function @xmath61 and the proposal density @xmath59 .",
    "typically , a birth - move is from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , i.e. in the above description we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in order to have a reasonable acceptance rate for the birth move",
    ", we try to keep the change in the likelihood function from @xmath66 to @xmath67 to be small , i.e. the birth - move is designed in such a way that @xmath68 . to achieve this small perturbation in likelihood function , instead of randomly adding a new dipole to the system",
    ", we replace one of the existing dipoles with two new dipoles .",
    "ideally , the combined magnetic field produced by the two new dipoles should be very close to the magnetic field of the replaced dipole , at every measurement point @xmath18 , @xmath69 .",
    "it is analytically difficult to ensure this closeness of magnetic field at every measurement point @xmath18 .",
    "we can simplify the problem by ensure that the magnetic field produced by the new pair of dipoles is close to that of the old dipole at one key measurement point @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "typically the measurement points can be arranged in a horizontal ( @xmath72 rectangular lattice@xmath73 , @xmath74 , as shown in figure 1 , and @xmath70 can be chosen to be located at the centre of the lattice .    in figure 1 ,",
    "the key measurement point @xmath70 is marked as a. assuming the randomly chosen dipole @xmath75 is located at point b with coordinate vector @xmath76 , we wish to find two locations near b such that the new pair of dipoles located at these two points will produce a combined magnetic field close to that of the old dipole @xmath9 .",
    "let the two new locations be e and d for the new dipoles @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as shown in figure 1",
    ".    denote the vector @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the distance between a and b and @xmath81 is the unit vector from b to a ( from dipole to measurement point )",
    ". now extend @xmath82 to @xmath83 such that @xmath84{2}\\times r_{b , a } { \\rm { \\bf \\hat r}}_{b , a}$ ] , i.e. let c be on the same line as @xmath82 and the length of @xmath83 is @xmath85{2}$ ] times that of the length of @xmath82 .",
    "now we put two dipoles @xmath86 at the same location c.    we now can easily show that a pair of dipoles @xmath87 co - located at c produce a combined magnetic field ( all 3 components ) at measurement point a identical to that of dipole @xmath9 , given that all dipoles have the same strength @xmath1 and unit vector @xmath2 . applying field equation ( 3 ) to dipole @xmath9 and measurement location @xmath88 ,",
    "we have @xmath89 similarly , applying field equation ( 3 ) to dipole @xmath90 and measurement location a , we have @xmath91 because @xmath92{2}\\times r_{b , a}$ ] and @xmath93 , comparing ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) we obtain @xmath94 .",
    "thus a pair of dipole @xmath86 co - located at point c produce combined magnetic field at point a identical to the magnetic field produced by dipole @xmath75 located at b , provided all the three dipoles have a common strength @xmath1 and unit vector @xmath2",
    ".    therefore we propose the following birth - move procedure , assuming the key measurement point a is fixed throughout the mcmc iterations    1 .   randomly remove a dipole @xmath95 ( located at b in figure 1 ) .",
    "2 .   locate point c by extending the line from @xmath82 to @xmath96 , so that c is on the same line as @xmath82 and @xmath97{2}|\\overline{ac}|$ ] ; 3 .",
    "put two dipoles at location c ; 4 .",
    "generate three independent random variables @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 from normal distribution @xmath101 ; 5 .",
    "move one of the two dipoles from c to location e , such that @xmath102 .",
    "this new dipole is denoted as @xmath103 located at @xmath104 ( point e in figure 1 ) ; 6 .   move the other dipole from c to location d , such that @xmath105 .",
    "this new dipole is denoted as @xmath106 located at @xmath107 ( point d in figure 1 ) .",
    "the random vector @xmath108 corresponding to the birth - move from @xmath62 to @xmath109 is identified as @xmath110 with a single parameter @xmath111 , the standard deviation for the random walk of a dipole .",
    "thus @xmath112 to find the jacobian of the deterministic mapping , we first find the mapping function @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116{2}$ ] , from which we find the jacobian to be @xmath117 .",
    "assume the probability to propose the general birth move ( as against a birth - move or a within - model move ) is @xmath118 , and we know the probability of choosing @xmath9 among the @xmath8 dipoles is @xmath119 , so for the birth - move we have @xmath120 and @xmath121      this is the reversal of the birth - move ( still using figure 1 as illustration ) :    1 .",
    "randomly select a pair of dipoles among the @xmath122 pairs , delete them from the system , assuming that , without losing generality , the pair are @xmath123 located at e and @xmath124 located at d ; 2 .   find the middle point c between e and d , as shown in figure 1 , and locate point b on the line @xmath125 so that @xmath126{2}\\times \\left| { \\overline { ab } } \\right|$ ] .",
    "3 .   put one dipole @xmath127 at location b , where @xmath128 is the coordinate of point b.    in the above one - for - two death - move , the only random number is from uniform @xmath129 .",
    "the probability of making the specific death - move is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the probability of attempting a general death - move .",
    "the mapping function @xmath132 is the inverse of the mapping function @xmath133 .      combining birth - move and death - move",
    "as described above , we obtain the following expressions for acceptance rates :    * _ birth - move acceptance rate _ * @xmath134 @xmath135 * _ death - move acceptance rate _ * @xmath136 @xmath137",
    "we consider three cases : 1 - a bulky formation ; 2 - a thin plate ; 3 - two objects . in each case",
    "we start with a single dipole , located at an arbitrary depth below the measured magnetic field , and with an arbitrary orientation and a fixed strength .        * case 1 . * in this case the dipoles form a regular cube .",
    "figure 2 shows a sample after 50000 simulations . in figure 2 ,",
    "the red balls represent the true model , and green balls are the best prediction .",
    "the horizontal blue lattice indicates measurement points , and the lines originating from these points are the magnetic vectors with green corresponding to the green dipoles ( the predicted dipoles ) and red corresponding to the red diploes ( the true model ) . as can be seen , on the whole",
    ", the inversed dipoles reasonably assemble the true model , with a few dipoles drifting to the deeper depth .",
    "the predicted magnetic vector field matches that of the true model very well - the green vectors and red vectors appear to be the same everywhere on the measurement lattice .",
    "* case 2 . * in this case , the dipoles form a horizontal thin sheet , as shown by the blue balls in figure 3 . as seen in figure 3 ,",
    "the resulting dipoles are too much scattered vertically .",
    "nevertheless , the horizontal scattering of the dipoles resemble the true model , and the resulting magnetic field vector matches the true vector field very well .",
    "* case 3 . * in this case the dipoles form two separated identical cubes at a significantly different depths and horizontal locations .",
    "it can be seen there are still too many dipoles scattered in between the two objects , and already the fit between the predicted and measured magnetic vector fields are very good .",
    "the three test cases show that the present method is promising but some challenges remain . for a single cube - like object",
    ", the inverse is not too bad in terms of representing the overall shape of the object , although there seem to be always some dipoles scattered below the object . if the single object is a bit extreme , such as a horizontal thin sheet , the inverse can not predict the depth resolution  it is too scattered vertically . for a more challenging problem of two objects located at different depth",
    ", the inverse tried hard to locate both , but with too many dipoles scattered in between .",
    "in all the above cases the forward problem was well resolved ",
    "i.e. the predicted magnetic field agrees very well with measured field .",
    "this is typical in geophysical inversion ",
    "non - uniqueness or ill - conditioning is demonstrated in terms of large uncertainties in the prediction of depth .",
    "we have proposed a reversible jump markov chain monte carlo ( rj - mcmc ) algorithm for both the magnetic vector and its gradient tensor to deal with this trans - dimensional inverse problem where the number of unknowns is one the unknowns .",
    "a special birth - death move strategy is designed to obtain a reasonable rate of acceptance for the rj - mcmc sampling .",
    "some preliminary results show the strength and challenges of the algorithm in inversing the magnetic measurement data .",
    "although it is very difficult , if not impossible , to predict each individual dipole accurately , it is important to predict the cloud of dipoles accurately ( e.g. uniformly distributed with the edges close to the true boundary )",
    ". a different likelihood function or prior ( in addition to new method ) may be of help in this regard .",
    "as always , it is difficult to predict the depth of the object with reasonable certainty .",
    "better ways are needed to locate multiple objects - with a clean break between two distinct objects , especially when they are located at very different depths .",
