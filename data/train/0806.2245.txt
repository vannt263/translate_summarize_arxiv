    "a primary tool for the study of ultracold matter is the magnetic trap , which can confine paramagnetic atoms on time scales of seconds . using the techniques of laser cooling",
    ", atoms can be loaded into magnetic traps  such as the quadrupole trap created with anti - helmholtz coils  at cold enough temperatures so that only modest magnetic field gradients are required to confine the atoms .",
    "once loaded , the lifetime in a quadrupole trap is typically limited by collisions , thermal background radiation , or majorana transitions  @xcite , wherein atomic spins passing near the zero in the field minimum are not able to adiabatically follow the field direction .",
    "to such an atom , the quantization axis is lost and it may emerge from the trap zero  spin - flipped \" to an untrapped state  @xcite .",
    "the majorana spin - flip loss mechanism can be severe enough to quench trap lifetime before forced evaporative cooling can bring the atomic system to quantum degeneracy .",
    "such cooling is thought to be a necessary requirement to reach the strongly correlated regimes that hold much promise for investigating novel ultracold collisions , chemistry , connections to condensed matter , and quantum information processing with particles beyond presently studied atoms , e.g. , polar molecules  @xcite . to prevent such loss in atomic systems ,",
    "evaporative cooling is instead performed in a secondary magnetic trap of the ioffe - pritchard or  baseball \"  @xcite configuration which does not possess a vanishing field magnitude near the trap minimum , and thereby preserves a quantization axis for all particles confined in the trap .",

    "large samples of molecules in their absolute rovibronic ground state have yet to be produced at temperatures below 10 mk  @xcite .",
    "sample confinement therefore requires very large magnetic fields , even for the case of a quadrupole trap  @xcite .",
    "electrostatic  @xcite and magnetostatic  @xcite traps have successfully been demonstrated for molecules , and inhomogeneous static electric and magnetic fields have been combined to increase trap depth  @xcite .",
    "lifetimes have so far been limited by collisions or blackbody radiation , but once evaporative or other cooling schemes  @xcite are employed , majorana transitions will be a dominant cause of loss in all the currently employed traps for ground state molecules . since the large fields necessary to create , e.g. , ioffe - pritchard traps , are generally unobtainable , we must carefully investigate the lifetime limits imposed by majorana transitions in the currently realizable quadrupole traps and explore possible schemes to avoid such loss mechanisms for real molecular systems .    for cold molecules that possess both magnetic and electric dipole moments , novel traps formed from both inhomogeneous magnetic and electric fields",
    "may be utilized to confine molecules in ways that mitigate the unwanted majorana transitions . in this paper",
    "we explore the basic physics of traps for molecules in which both magnetic and electric fields are present , which we show can mitigate majorana loss even for simple field configurations consisting of superimposed quadrupole and homogenous fields . using a reduced , but analytically solvable , model of a molecule in both electric and magnetic fields ,",
