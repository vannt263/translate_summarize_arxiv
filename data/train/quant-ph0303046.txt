    "analysis of heat engine models has been a major part of thermodynamic development .",

    "szilard and brillouin constructed a model engine which enabled them to resolve the paradox raised by maxwell s demon @xcite .",
    "the subsequent insight enabled the unification of negative entropy with information . in the same tradition , the present paper studies a heat engine model with a quantum working fluid for the purpose of tracing the microscopic origin of friction .",
    "the function of a quantum heat engine as well as its classical counterpart is to transform heat into useful work . in such engines ,",
    "the work is extracted by an external field exploiting the spontaneous flow of heat from a hot to a cold reservoir .",
    "the present model performs this task by a four stroke cycle of operation .",
    "all four branches of the cycle can be described by quantum equations of motion .",
    "the thermodynamical consequences can therefore be derived from first principles .",
    "the present paper lays the foundation for a comprehensive analysis of a discrete model of a quantum heat engine .",
    "a brief outline which has been published emphasized the engines optimal performance characteristics @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the engines power output vs. cycle time mimics very closely a classical heat engine subject to friction .",
    "the source of the apparent friction was traced back to a quantum phenomena : the noncommutability of the external control field hamiltonian and the internal hamiltonian of the working medium .",
    "the fundamental issue involved require a detailed and careful study .",
    "the approach followed is to derive the thermodynamical concepts from quantum principles .",
    "the connecting bridges are the quantum thermodynamical observables . following the tradition of gibbs a minimum set of observables",
    "is sought which are sufficient to characterize the performance of the engine .",
    "when the working fluid is in thermal equilibrium , the energy observable is sufficient to completely describe the state of the system and therefore all other observables . during the cycle of operation",
    "the working fluid is in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "in frictionless engines , where the internal hamiltonian commutes with the external control field , the energy observable is still sufficient to characterize the engine s cycle @xcite . in the general case",
    "additional variables have to be added .",
    "for example in the current model , a set of three quantum thermodynamic observables is sufficient to characterize the performance . with only two additional variables",
    "the state of the working fluid can be characterized also .",
    "a knowledge of the state is necessary in order to evaluate the entropy and the dynamical temperature .",
    "these variables are crucial in establishing a thermodynamic perspective .",
    "the current investigation is in line with previous studies of quantum heat engines @xcite .",
    "all the studies of first principle quantum models have conformed to the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "these models have been either continuous resembling turbines @xcite , or discrete as in the present model @xcite .",

    "real heat engines operate far from the reversible conditions , where the maximum power is restricted due to finite heat transfer @xcite , internal friction and heat leaks @xcite .",
    "analysis of the quantum models of heat engines , based on a first principle dynamical theory , enable to pinpoint the fundamental origins of finite heat transfer , internal friction and heat leaks .",
    "studies of quantum continuous heat engine models have revealed most of the known characteristics of real engines . in accordance with finite time thermodynamics the power always exhibits a definite maximum @xcite , and the performance has been limited by heat leaks @xcite",
    ". finally indications of restrictions due to friction like phenomena have been indicated @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with the analysis is that it is very hard to separate the individual contributions in the case of a continuous operating engine .    to facilitate the interpretation",
    "a four stroke discrete engine has been chosen for analysis .",
    "the cycle of operation is controlled by the segments of time that the engine is in contact with a hot and cold bath and by the time interval required to vary the external field . to simplify the analysis",
    "the time segments where the working fluid is in contact with the heat baths are carried out at constant external field .",
    "such a cycle of operation resembles the otto cycle which is composed of two _ isochores _ where heat is transfered and two _ adiabats _ where work is done .",
    "this simplification allows to obtain the values of the thermodynamical observables during the cycle of operation from first principles in closed form .",
    "the quantum thermodynamical observables constitute a set of variables which are sufficient to completely describe the heat engine performance characteristics as well as the entropy and temperature changes of its working medium .",
    "the analysis of the performance requires a quantum dynamical description of the changes in the thermodynamical observables during the engine s cycle of operation .",
