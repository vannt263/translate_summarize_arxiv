    "in quantum field theory containing scalars it may occur that there are more than one local minima in configuration space .",
    "in such cases a system trapped in a metastable vacuum will decay towards a vacuum with lower energy through quantum tunneling .",
    "semiclassical methods can be used to describe the procedure @xcite , @xcite . in this approach",
    "the theory is studied in euclidean space and a classical tunneling solution that matches the appropriate boundary conditions is constructed .",
    "typically this solution describes a bubble , which separates the true vacuum from the false vacuum , and which after its emission starts expanding , asymptotically with the speed of light .",
    "typically it is very difficult to find analytic solutions for any given potential that contains a metastable vacuum .",
    "the original papers @xcite , @xcite focus on a limit , in which the energy difference between the true and false vacua is small . in this limit",
    "the radius of the emitted bubble is large in comparison to its width , thus the name  thin wall approximation \" for this approach .",
    "this limit allows for analytical expressions of the bubble emission rates .",
    "however such a limit destroys all other potentially interesting features of the solution , especially in the interior of the bubble .    in order to describe potential barriers that are not appropriate for the thin wall approximation",
    ", we can either make a numerical computation , or approximate the potential with another one that is exactly solvable .",
    "the latter is analyzed in @xcite , where a linear and a rectangular potential are analytically solved and the relevant decay rates calculated . however , if the actual potential is smooth , such potentials are clearly not a very good approximation for the regions of the two vacua and the top of the barrier , so several qualitative features of the solution may be lost .",
    "for example , the discontinuity of the potential in the rectangular approximation removes all dynamics as the field rolls towards the true vacuum .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend the study of the triangular model and moreover solve some more realistic , still analytically solvable potentials , and try to extract qualitative features of the related physics , and possible cosmological implications .",
    "it is going to turn out that the triangular model with parameters of planck scale can provide an elegant explanation for the order of magnitude of the measured dark energy density in our universe .",
    "several other options with more singular potential also exist predicting the correct order of magnitude .",
    "we are going to study exact tunneling solutions in the simple case of a single scalar field and a potential containing a unique false vacuum .",
    "we are particularly interested in analytically continuing our solutions to imaginary euclidean radius in order to discover the evolution of the field inside the bubble .",
    "the lagrangian describing our system is @xmath1    from now on , we name the positions of the true and false vacua as @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively and the relevant values of the potential @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it has been proven that in scalar field theory the spherically symmetric solutions are favored @xcite .",
    "this is intuitively reasonable , as the sphere maximizes the ratio of volume to surface .",
    "thus we assume that the tunneling solution depends only on the euclidean radius @xmath6 .    under the assumption that the solution depends only on the euclidean radius",
    ", the euclidean field equation is reduced to @xmath7 where the dot implies differentiation with respect to @xmath6 and the prime implies differentiation with respect to the field @xmath8 .",
    "the solution has to obey the following boundary conditions @xmath9 in the following we are going to make simple assumptions for the form of the potential , that are going to allow us to find analytic solutions .",
    "before we proceed to solve the equation of motion , we would like to make a comment on the general form of the solutions .",
    "typically we are going to assume that the potential is described by different formulas before and after the top of the barrier .",
    "one would expect that we would result in a solution of the form @xmath10 this describes a bubble whom profile is as following .",
    "outside a certain radius @xmath11 the field rests in the false vacuum . inside this radius",
    "the field climbs the barrier between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and then rolls down to the true vacuum between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and then stays there . in such cases the analytic continuation to imaginary euclidean radius",
    "is trivially @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    "we see that in the rectangular approximation , tunneling solutions always look like that , however in the triangular approximation we may get such a solution or not depending on the parameters of the potential .",
    "however in the triangular approximation , and as we will show later on in other cases , it may be true that the field never reaches the true vacuum in euclidean space .",
    "the conditions leading to such a result in the triangular approximation are not very restricting on the parameters of the potential .",
    "in such cases the solution is going to be of the form @xmath15 and the analytic continuation to imaginary proper time is nontrivial .",
    "we will see that actually the field in such cases never reaches the true vacuum , but performs a damped oscillation around it .",
    "the rest of the paper focuses in this category of solutions .",
    "the only selections of potential that preserve the linearity of the equation of motion is a linear and a quadratic one .",
    "the quadratic naturally is the most obvious selection to approximate the region of a vacuum , thus we will start our analysis studying a potential barrier built out of quadratics . the simplest possible barrier potential built by quadratics",
    "is described by @xmath16        and looks like in figure [ fig : quadpot ] .",
    "because of the shape of such a potential , we call this the volcanic approximation .      in order to find the tunneling solution we need to find the general solution to the equation",
    "@xmath17 if we make the substitution @xmath18 the equation is written as @xmath19 which is exactly the modified bessel equation , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus the general solution is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and @xmath25 the modified bessel function of the second kind . in the construction of the instanton solution we are going to need the derivative of the solution .",
    "this is given by @xmath26    using the above result it is clear that a solution that does not reach the true vacuum in euclidean space will look like @xmath27 let s now apply the boundary and matching conditions to specify the undetermined constants and the radii .",
    "the solution has to be stationary at the origin .",
    "as @xmath28 diverges at the origin , and @xmath29 is stationary , we get @xmath30 demanding continuity of the solution and its derivative at @xmath31 gives us the following two equations @xmath32 as both modified bessel functions of the first and second kind are positive , the only solution to this problem for any finite @xmath11 is @xmath33 .",
    "however as modified bessel functions of the second kind decrease exponentially at infinity , we have the option that actually @xmath11 is infinite and @xmath34 demanding that @xmath35 gives us @xmath36 we have expressed all parameters in terms of @xmath12 . finally demanding continuity of the derivative at @xmath37 , specifies this .",
    "@xmath38 this equation is not analytically solvable , so we can not acquire an analytic expression for @xmath12 .    to sum up",
    "the tunneling solution is @xmath39 where @xmath12 is given by ( [ eq : volcnum ] ) .",
    "we expect that in analogy to the triangular approximation @xcite , if equation ( [ eq : volcnum ] ) does not have a solution , the solution reaches the true vacuum in euclidean space . both functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are monotonous positive and take values between zero and one , as one can see in figure [ fig : volcanocondition ] .",
    "thus there is always exactly one solution , as long as @xmath42 otherwise we should expect a solution that reaches the true vacuum in euclidean space .",
    "however , such a solution will look like @xmath43 demanding continuity and smoothness at @xmath44 , gives us @xmath45 as the modified bessel function are positive , the only solution to the above system of equations for any @xmath46 is @xmath47 . the only way to save",
    "this is to set @xmath13 to zero",
    ". then smoothness at @xmath44 gives us @xmath48 .",
    "however then the field has not reached the true vacuum at @xmath44 , as @xmath49 .",
    "thus it looks like finding a solution that reaches the true vacuum in euclidean space is problematic .",
    "indeed we can see that condition ( [ eq : volccondition ] ) is always satisfied . from the expression of the potential ( [ eq : volcpotential ] )",
    "we can find @xmath50 thus @xmath51 which implies @xmath52 that means that condition ( [ eq : volccondition ] ) always holds .",
    "thus in the volcanic approximation , there is always exactly one tunneling solution , that never reaches the true vacuum in euclidean space .",
    "this implies that we should expect to find some kind of damped oscillation around the true vacuum in the interior of the bubble , if we analytically expand to imaginary euclidean radius for any parameters of the volcanic potential .",
    "as this behavior is determined by the potential at the region of the true vacuum , the fact that the solution in the case of the triangular or rectangular approximation may be constant for imaginary euclidean distance @xcite , is an effect because of the non - smoothness of the potential .",
    "we expect that any smooth potential produces tunneling solution with the characteristic behavior of the damped oscillation around the true vacuum in the interior of the bubble .",
    "the solution of the volcanic potential is very easy to analytically continue to imaginary proper time .",
    "the modified bessel functions are analytic functions having the property @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "thus for @xmath55 we get @xmath56 which clearly describes a damped oscillation of the field around the true vacuum in the interior of the bubble . for large @xmath57",
    "we can use the asymptotic formula for the bessel function to get @xmath58 the solution is plotted in figure [ fig : volcsol ] .          for possible applications to cosmology",
    ", it would be interesting to calculate the stress - energy tensor in the interior of the bubble .",
    "unlike traditional treatment , where the stress energy tensor contains only the vacuum energy of the true vacuum , here the damped oscillation around it is going to contribute too .    the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath59 applying our lagrangian we get @xmath60    our solution depends only on proper time , thus @xmath61 using the above we get @xmath62 the first term of the stress - energy tensor is the kinetic energy of the remnant of the bubble wall inside the bubble .",
    "far away from the bubble wall , it contributes only to the time - time component of the stress - energy tensor , thus it behaves as dark matter .",
    "the second term is identical to vacuum energy , that does not only originate from the energy of the true vacuum , but also on the oscillation of the field .",
    "@xmath63 using our solution we get @xmath64 for large @xmath57 we can use the asymptotic formula for the bessel function to get @xmath65 + v _ - , \\\\",
    "\\rho _ { wall }   & = \\frac{{2 m _ -   r_t ^2 \\left ( { \\phi _ -    - \\phi _ t } \\right)^2 } } { { \\pi i_1 \\left ( { m _ -   r_t } \\right)^2 \\tau ^3 } } \\cos \\left ( { m _ -   \\tau   - \\frac{{\\pi } } { 4 } } \\right)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected from virial theorem , the average of kinetic and potential energy terms in the lagrangian cancel out , because of the quadratic form of the potential around the true vacuum .",
    "however this kind of ideas can in general provide a cosmological constant that depends on the size of the bubble",
    ". it could be a promising candidate for the explanation of the small size of the observed cosmological constant .",
    "the volcano potential may be used to approximate decay rates of metastable vacua , in the case of a potential that does not fit the requirements for the thin wall approximation .",
    "thus , it is interesting to calculate the decay rate .",

    ".    it would be interesting to study whether the decay rate we just calculated reduces to the known formula in the thin wall limit . in the limit where the energy difference between the true and false vacuum is small , we can derive from the form of the potential that @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we can use the above to find @xmath75 that means that the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : volcnum ] ) is very close to one , thus @xmath12 has to be large , as expected for the thin wall limit .",

    "the volcano approximation makes a bad non - smooth description of the barrier top .",
    "we can use the fact that quadratic potentials are solvable , in order to improve our approximation , and search for new qualitative properties of the solutions that originate from the form of the potential at the barrier top .",
    "an appropriate approximation is @xmath98 which is plotted in figure [ fig : smoothpot ] .",
    "such an approximation provides quite a large flexibility in fitting an arbitrary potential .",
    "we can select the above potential in such a way that matches the actual potential in positions and energies of the true and false vacuum , as well as the top of barrier , and moreover the curvature of the potential in these positions or alternatively select so that it matches the positions and energies of the vacua , as well as one the three aforementioned curvatures and simultaneously be smooth at @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "@xmath122 is going to be smaller than @xmath123 , thus making the above equation @xmath124 this means that the solution for @xmath114 has entered a region of values for which it is not valid .",
    "thus any solution except for the first one is not valid , the solution is unique .",
    "this is not a general proof of the uniqueness of the solution for a general potential , however in this case the oscillatory behavior of the solution in the region of the barrier top resembles exactly the general behavior that could produce multiple solutions in general .",
    "so the only solution it may hold is the first solution , which is valid if @xmath125 , or else @xmath126 if this condition does not hold we should search for a solution of the second case .",
    "figure [ fig : smooth1condition ] implies that the curvature of the potential at the top is strongly related with the size of the emitted bubble . as we stated above",
    ", the only valid solution is the one corresponding to the smallest solution of equation ( [ eq : smoothnum ] ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : smooth1condition ] we can see , that this solution always satisfies @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the nth root of @xmath129 .",
    "we note that @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "so the characteristic radius of the emitted bubble is always of the order @xmath132 .    as this case of solutions is the one that actually lies as far as possible from the thin wall approximation , in which the radius of the bubble tends to infinity",

    "let s suppose that big bang was the emission of a bubble , so we are actually living inside a bubble with the size of the universe .",
    "let also suppose that the potential of the phase transition is well fit by the triangular approximation .",
    "it actually suffices that the potential in the region of the true vacuum is triangular .",
    "the natural selection of the potential parameters is that they are of planck scale .",
    "finally let s suppose that the energy of the true vacuum is exactly zero .    under these assumptions",
    ", we should today observe an effective cosmological constant of the order @xmath202 which obviously depends on the age of the universe .",
    "the size of the observable universe today is about @xmath203 in planck units .",
    "thus the cosmological constant we should observe in our scenario , would be @xmath204    this is the right order of magnitude that we measure today @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    with this model we do nt solve the original cosmological constant problem @xcite , namely why the vacuum energy of sm does not gravitate .",
    "most probably we need more information on quantum gravity to resolve this .",
    "however it resolves the cosmological constant problems that occurred after the recent measurement of it @xcite .",
    "it explains its order of magnitude and if we assume that matter originates from the kinetic energy of bubble walls , then our model also explain why the matter content and dark energy content of our universe are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the idea of relating physical constants with cosmological quantities is not new at all .",
    "paul dirac in the 1930 s observed that ratios of orders of magnitudes of cosmological quantities are similar to ratios of orders of magnitudes concerning the fundamental interactions . conjecturing that this can not be a coincidence he expressed the large number hypothesis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , according to which fundamental constants of nature , such as newton s gravitational constant , depend on the age of the universe",
    "the recent discovery of another large number , namely the ratio of the theoretical and observed vacuum energy densities , lead to similar tries to connect the energy density of the vacuum with the age of the universe @xcite , as we do in this paper .",
    "additionally the idea of the dark energy originating from a scalar is not new , too .",
    "quintessence models can describe the dark energy content of the universe . in this approach",
    "the dark energy is the effect of a slow rolling scalar field instead of one that performs a dumped oscillation , as in our case .",
    "the subject of quintessence is quite broad .",
    "a nice review is given in @xcite .",
    "one critical objection about our model is the singular form of the potential at the position of the true vacuum .",
    "one should be able to find a model which predicts the existence of such a vacuum and moreover develop quantum field theory in the region of such a vacuum to show that the low energy effective description is also singular .",
    "however linear potential can occur by brane interactions in an orbifold like in the ekpyrotic scenario for the big bang @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "definitely further study is required on this field .",
    "it is interesting that the stress - energy tensor in the interior of the bubble has a direct dependency on the size of the bubble .",
    "it is also interesting that depending on the potential this stress - energy tensor may represent a substance with negative pressure , thus providing a candidate for dark energy .",
    "although it is impossible to find exact solutions for general form of the potential , we will try to calculate the asymptotic form of this damped oscillation for a potential of the form @xmath206 . in order to simplify things we assume that the potential is infinite for @xmath207 , or else @xmath159",
    "is the boundary of the configuration space .",
    "thus the solution gets reflected when it reaches @xmath159 .",
    "this may represent an effective field theory , where the scalar is a moduli describing geometry of some brane configuration living in an orbifold .",
    "we are interested in the damped oscillations a field performs around the area of the vacuum of a potential of the form @xmath208 the potential is sketched in figure [ fig : potential ] .        assuming a spherically symmetric solution , the equation of motion is @xmath209 where dot represents differentiation with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "if we define @xmath210 the equation of motion can be written as @xmath211 this form of equation gives us a better point of view about how the system dissipates .",
    "we can not find an exact solution to the above , but we expect that when @xmath57 is large , the losses are small in one period , and thus we can express the above equation as @xmath212 where @xmath213 .",
    "now we can use the explicit form for our potential @xmath214 and the virial theorem .",
    "the latter instructs us that @xmath215 using the above , equation ( [ eq : averageeom1 ] ) can be written @xmath216 whose solution trivially is @xmath217 @xmath201 depends on the parameters of the potential .",
    "if we assume that a characteristic mass scale of the potential is @xmath218 then the above solution behaves as @xmath219    if we are about to explain the dark energy content of the universe as this energy stored in the damped oscillation of the scalar field , we should check what is the appropriate value for the potential mass scale @xmath218 . in such case",
    "@xmath220 has to equal the dark energy density measured today , and @xmath57 should equal the size of the observable universe @xmath221",
    ". then @xmath218 must be @xmath222 if we use @xmath223 and @xmath224 we get the behavior shown figure [ fig : potentialscale ] .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=65.0% ]    here we would like to notice three interesting cases .    1 .   @xmath225 .",
    "this case has already been studied in section [ sec : triangular ] .",
    "the scale of the potential turns out to be the planck scale , which obviously is a natural choice .",
    "our result obviously agree with the results of the previous section .",
    "2 .   @xmath226 . in this case",
    "it turns out that @xmath227 , thus it is about @xmath228 , the electroweak scale",
    ". it could provide a connection to other known physics .",
    "3 .   @xmath229 . in this case",
    "the size of the universe does not help us at all to solve the hierarchy problem between the potential scale and the cosmological scale .",
    "we just convert the cosmological constant problem to a classical fine tuning problem as we need a potential with characteristic scale the cosmological one .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath60    our solution depends only on proper time , thus @xmath230 using the above we get @xmath231 @xmath232    in the far future or in local coordinates , this is diagonal and describes an average energy density and pressure @xmath233 use of virial theorem is adequate to calculate @xmath234 which is plotted in figure [ fig : wfactor ] .     as function of @xmath235,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    in the previous section we distinguished three interesting cases .",
    "it turns out that the calculated @xmath236 for those is also interesting .    1 .",
    "@xmath225 . in the case of a linear potential",
    "it turns out that @xmath237 .",
    "this is exactly the boundary case between an accelerating universe and a decelerating one .",
    "2 .   @xmath226 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath238 .",
    "this is not the most favored value experimentally , however it corresponds to an accelerating universe .",
    "3 .   @xmath229 .",
    "this gives us @xmath239 which is the most favorable value for the dark energy as measured today , and indistinguishable from a cosmological constant term , as long as the equation of state is considered .",
    "we should not forget that actually the field performs an oscillation around the vacuum .",
    "that means that a fair question is whether the period of this oscillation is large enough in order to allow for measurable phenomena .",
    "if we neglect the dissipation term , we can estimate the period of the oscillation , just using conservation of @xmath240 .",
    "@xmath241    as the period depends on @xmath240 like @xmath242 , for any @xmath235 smaller than 2 , it turns out that as universe grows , the period of the oscillations is getting smaller and smaller .",
    "if we use the experimental values for dark energy density and the radius of the universe , we result in a period of oscillations at our age , that is even smaller than the planck time , thus making these oscillations experimentally unmeasurable .",
    "having such high frequency oscillations seems peculiar , however we study a strange field theory , where the potential around the vacuum is not harmonic .",
    "further study on such field theories is required .",
    "we analyzed tunneling solutions for some potentials that can provide us with analytic solutions .",
    "we learned several qualitative facts about phase transitions in field theory , as well as we acquired some useful tools .",
    "the volcano and ever better the smooth quadratic potential , can provide tools for calculating decay rates in several problems where the thin wall approximation @xcite does not apply .",
    "of course we already have the tools of rectangular and triangular approximation @xcite , however , as the decay rate per unit volume depends on the euclidean action exponentially , a calculation of greater accuracy may be useful .    as the volcanic potential model teaches us",
    ", it is typical for such bubble solutions , that the field never reaches the true vacuum in the interior of the bubble .",
    "instead it is performing a damped oscillation around it , whose amplitude is some kind of function of time that depends on the form of the potential around the true vacuum .",
    "this phenomenon may be of interest depending on the form of the potential .",
    "the description of the barrier between the true and false vacuum by a non - convex potential generates questions about the uniqueness of the tunneling solution .",
    "naively such a potential generates oscillatory behavior of the field at the region of the top of the barrier , that could result in multiple solutions . although we do nt have a proof , the smooth quadratic potential example shows that this is not the case .",
    "an interest lesson we also learn from the smooth quadratic potential example is that the size of the emitted bubble strongly depends and it is of the same order of magnitude of the inverse of the curvature of the potential at the top of the barrier or at least the latter serves as a lower bound for the radius of the bubble .",
    "this has an interesting implication in the case of an asymptotically expanding universe .",
    "typically phase transitions in field theory occur at temperatures of the order of characteristic quantities of the potential describing the system .",
    "masses are such quantities . thus according to our previous arguments",
    "the size of emitted bubbles is going to be of the order of inverse temperature . depending on the cosmological model ,",
    "the radius of the universe is also a function of temperature , thus resulting in an upper bound for the possible number of bubbles emitted .",
    "this restricts the number of bubble collisions resulting in several cosmological predictions .",
    "of course this is not going to be the case in a post - inflationary universe .",
    "the most interesting result is that , in a triangular potential , we observe an effective cosmological constant in the interior of the bubble , that decreases as the bubble expands , in such a way that its scale asymptotically equals the geometric means of the size of the bubble and the scale of the potential . assuming that the parameters of the potential are of planck scale , and that the true vacuum energy vanishes",
    ", we make a very good prediction for the cosmological constant order of magnitude , which agrees with what we measure today .",
    "of course this effective cosmological constant term is not the only contribution to the stress - energy tensor , resulting in the ratio of pressure to energy density in the interior of the bubble being larger than the experimentally favored value -1 .",
    "however , the model we use contains only one scalar and is very simplistic",
    ". the idea may be useful in the construction of a more realistic model .",
    "later we extend our analysis to study the damped oscillation for a more general potential .",
    "it turns out that other interesting options also exist .",
    "if the potential is proportional to the square root of the field , then a potential with characteristic parameters of the electroweak scale predicts a dark energy content of the right order of magnitude and an accelerating universe .",
    "of course such a model for the cosmological constant predicts a vacuum energy that depends on the distance from the bubble wall , thus on position inside the bubble .",
    "current experiments do not rule out such a dependence , thus this is an direct experimental prediction of our model .    such a time dependent cosmological constant",
    "is also predicted by quintessence models .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the value of the observed cosmological constant is related with the size of the universe in a more direct way .",
    "moreover even in the case of a quadratic potential there is still some non - trivial form for the stress - energy tensor that could have interesting cosmological implications in the expansion of the universe . in the case of more singular potentials ,",
    "a connection with inflation could also be interesting .",
    "finally there is the open direction of generalizing to different potentials , or greater number of fields .",
    "interesting behavior like the one we discovered in the triangular model , may appear in different cases .",
    "we believe that the most interesting future direction would be the inclusion of gravity into the problem .",
    "this way , we would be able to directly observe the effects of the discovered phenomena in the evolution of the universe .",
