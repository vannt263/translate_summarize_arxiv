    "transverse oscillations in coronal loops have been detected in observations made with the euv telescope on board of the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) in 1999 by @xcite and @xcite . since then the detection of these oscillations has been confirmed and in addition damped oscillations have been observed in hot coronal loops by the sumer instrument on board soho ( @xcite ) .",
    "the trace oscillations have periods of the order of @xmath0 minutes and comparatively short damping times of the order of @xmath1 minutes .",
    "there is general consensus that these oscillations are fast standing kink mode oscillations .",
    "however , there is still debate about the mechanism that causes the observed fast damping .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested : phase mixing ( @xcite ) , resonant absorption ( @xcite ) , lateral and foot - point wave leakage ( @xcite ) , drag due to the ambient plasma ( @xcite ) . in order to discriminate between different damping mechanisms @xcite suggested to study how the observed damping times vary as a function of the corresponding observed periods . in particular @xcite claimed that the observed values are compatible with phase mixing if the damping time increases with period @xmath2 as @xmath3 and with resonant absorption if it increases as @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of the present letter is to show that random observations of oscillation events in coronal loops are very unlikely to produce any particular relation between damping times and periods whatever the actual mechanism is that causes the damping .",
    "in particular we focus on resonant absorption and use synthetic data for periods and damping times to show that various samples of pairs of periods and damping times can lead to various and widely different scaling laws .",
    "the suggestion that the damping time increases linearly with period , @xmath4 , was triggered by analytical asymptotic expressions for the damping of the quasi - mode given by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see reviews @xcite and @xcite ) . these asymptotic expressions are derived in the approximation that the non - uniform layer is thin .",
    "this is the so - called thin boundary ( tb ) approximation .",
    "jump conditions are used to connect the solution over the ideal singularity and to avoid solving the non - ideal mhd wave equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the asymptotic expression for the damping time in the tb approximation",
    "is    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the density contrast , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the constant internal and external densities , @xmath9 the thickness of the non - uniform layer defined in [ @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the mean radius .",
    "@xmath13 is a parameter that depends on the variation of density in the transitional layer . for a linear variation @xmath14 ( @xcite ) , for a sinusoidal variation @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we shall use the version with @xmath15 .",
    "equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) might be considered to be an invitation for predicting a linear variation of damping time with period . however , the crucial point for this prediction to make sense is that the remaining quantities in equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) are constants ; i.e. all the oscillations events under considerations have to occur in loops with the same density contrast @xmath16 and the same radial inhomogeneity @xmath17 . when applied to a collection of oscillating loops on which no prior information on their structure is available equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] )",
    "does not allow any prediction .",
    "a naive use of equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) indicates that for a given period @xmath2 the damping times can differ by f.e .",
    "a factor @xmath18 for the combinations @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is indeed a naive use of equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) since @xmath2 is a function of @xmath16 also . in order to make that clear we use results from the thin tube ( tt ) or long wave - length approximation for the period @xmath2 .",
    "our starting point is the well - known expression for the square of the frequency of the kink mode in a cylinder with a uniform and straight magnetic field along the @xmath21-axis ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the local alfvn frequency and @xmath24 the local alfvn velocity ( the subscripts `` i '' and `` e '' refer to internal and external , respectively ) .",
    "now we note that for the fundamental mode @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the length of the loop , and we convert frequencies to periods and rewrite equation  ( [ truedisc1 ] ) as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the internal alfvn travel time and the function @xmath29 is defined as    @xmath30    it is convenient to adopt a reference loop with magnetic field strength @xmath31 , length @xmath32 , and internal density @xmath33 .",
    "this reference loop allows us to consider loops of different dimensions and to introduce the normalized period @xmath34 defined as    @xmath35    @xmath34 can be interpreted as the period measured in the unit @xmath36 . with this normalized period equation  ( [ periodnorm1 ] ) takes the simple form    @xmath37    with @xmath38 . from equation  ( [ periodnorm3 ] )",
    "we learn that , for a given value of @xmath39 , @xmath34 varies continuously from @xmath40 to @xmath39 when @xmath16 is allowed to vary from 1 ( no loop ) to @xmath41 ( outside vacuum ) .",
    "let us now turn back to equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) and rewrite it as    @xmath42    with the function @xmath43 defined as    @xmath44    in what follows we shall refer to the combination of the tb approximation to compute the damping time and the tt approximation for the period as the tttb approximation .    in the same way as for the period it is convenient to introduce the normalized decay time @xmath45 as    @xmath46",
    "@xmath45 can be interpreted as the decay time measured in the unit @xmath47 . with the use of this normalized decay time we can write equation  ( [ decaytnorm1 ] ) as    @xmath48    which tells us that , for a given value of @xmath39 , @xmath45 depends on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the dependency on @xmath17 is straightforward .",
    "the dependency on @xmath16 is slightly more complicated .",
    "basically , @xmath45 is a decreasing function of @xmath16 varying from @xmath49 for @xmath50 to @xmath51 for @xmath52 . in summary ,",
    "@xmath45 is a decreasing function of both @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "we now combine equations  ( [ periodnorm3 ] ) and ( [ decaytnorm3 ] ) . on figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we have plotted @xmath45 versus @xmath34 for values of @xmath16 from 1.5 up to 10 and of @xmath17 from 0.01 to 2 . for every value of @xmath39",
    "the pairs @xmath53 define a vertical strip in the @xmath54-plane with a maximum horizontal extent of @xmath55 . as a matter of fact",
    "@xmath39 can take on any positive real value , but for clarity we have limited the values to @xmath56 .",
    "the inclusion of intermediate values of @xmath39 , such as @xmath57 , produces vertical strips overlapping those shown on figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the iso - lines corresponding to a constant value of @xmath16 are vertical lines since the period is independent of the inhomogeneity length scale , in the thin tube approximation .",
    "the iso - lines corresponding to a constant value of @xmath17 are not straight and defined by the equation    @xmath58    it is clear from figure  [ fig1 ] that the model of resonant absorption in its most simple mathematical formulation using the tttb approximation produces a wide variety of combinations of @xmath59 now let us see what happens when a collection of pairs @xmath60 is drawn from this reservoir .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that different collections of data can be produced by the simple tttb mathematical model of resonant absorption with each of them leading to scaling laws , @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 a function of the equilibrium parameters ) , with different indices , @xmath63 .",
    "we use equations  ( [ periodnorm3 ] ) and ( [ decaytnorm3 ] ) , together with the particular relation between @xmath64 and @xmath34 for each index @xmath63 , and derive those collections of data . as a first example we have plotted on figure  [ fig2 ] a collection of @xmath60 combinations drawn from the big reservoir depicted on figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "these combinations define a scaling law with index @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that we have engineered the data presented on figure  [ fig2 ] so as to fit the scaling law with such index . actually , the engineering is relatively straightforward .",
    "we require @xmath66 .",
    "the left - hand side is the value of the function @xmath62 for a starting configuration with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we fix a loop to start with by prescribing the values @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 and compute values of @xmath39 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that satisfy the equation @xmath73    likewise on figure  [ fig2 ] we have also plotted a second collection of data that now define a scaling law with index @xmath74 . to obtain these data ,",
    "we start from a loop with prescribed values @xmath70 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and compute values of @xmath39 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that satisfy the equation @xmath77    a third collection of data , that now define a scaling law with index @xmath78 is also shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . according to",
    "@xcite this value of the index singles out phase mixing as damping mechanism .",
    "here it is obtained for a collection of data that are produced by the theoretical prediction for resonant absorption .",
    "we start from a loop with prescribed values @xmath70 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 and compute values of @xmath39 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that satisfy the equation    @xmath81    finally , on figure  [ fig2 ] we have also plotted a collection of data that define a scaling law with the canonical value n=1 for the index .",
    "we start from a loop with prescribed values @xmath70 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 and compute values of @xmath39 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that satisfy the equation    @xmath84    note that @xmath39 is absent from ( [ scaling+1 ] ) meaning that a solution of ( [ scaling+1 ] ) can combined with any value of @xmath85 .",
    "an obvious solution to ( [ scaling+1 ] ) is @xmath86    equation  ( [ scaling+1ss ] ) defines a straight line in the @xmath87-plane .",
    "note that equation  ( [ scaling+1ss ] ) is not the only solution in the @xmath88-plane .",
    "any combination @xmath89 that satisfies equation  ( [ scaling+1 ] ) combined with @xmath900 , \\ ; \\infty[$ ] produces the same straight line in the @xmath87 plane as solution ( [ scaling+1ss ] ) .",
    "since the function @xmath91 is a decreasing function of its argument , a value @xmath92 is combined with a value @xmath93 and conversely a value @xmath94 is combined with a value @xmath95 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig2 ] that almost any scaling law can be obtained from data produced by the simple tttb mathematical model of resonant absorption",
    ". all the periods and damping times plotted in figure  [ fig2 ] correspond to combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , obtained from equations  ( [ scaling-1 ] ) , ( [ scaling+2 ] ) , ( [ scaling4/3 ] ) , and ( [ scaling+1 ] ) , that are reasonable values of these quantities in the ranges @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath97 $ ] . the discrete sets of values in figure  [ fig2 ] arise due to the considered discrete values of @xmath39 , but loops with different internal travel times , with respect to the reference loop , would give the full set of values for @xmath64 and @xmath34 along the solid lines depicted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the tttb approximation as a mathematical model for resonant absorption has its clear limitations .",
    "first , the values of the period defined by equation  ( [ periodnorm3 ] ) are independent of the radius @xmath12 and the inhomogeneity length scale @xmath17 . in reality , the period is a function of the density contrast @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath12 . as a consequence",
    "the iso - lines corresponding to a constant value of @xmath16 in the @xmath98-plane are no longer straight vertical lines . for a given value of @xmath39 this dependency of the period on",
    "@xmath16 produces additional spread on the original vertical strips .",
    "second , the tttb approximation is an accurate approximation as long as the damping time is sufficiently longer than the period , since this is an inherent assumption for carrying out the asymptotic analysis leading to equation  ( [ decaytimerr2 ] ) .",
    "we can expect this equation to be inaccurate for large values of the density contrast @xmath16 and large values of the inhomogeneity length scale @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] is the twin version of figure  [ fig1 ] with the values of @xmath34 and @xmath45 now computed for fully non - uniform 1-d loops ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] is very similar in appearance to figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the differences occur where they expected to occur .",
    "the vertical strips of figure  [ fig1 ] are now replaced with strips slightly oblique to the vertical axis and the largest differences appear at the short values of the damping times corresponding to the large values of the density contrast @xmath16 and large values of the inhomogeneity length scale @xmath17 .",
    "the basic message from both figures is the same .",
    "the model of resonant absorption produces a wide variety of combinations in the @xmath60-plane .",
    "if we draw a curve defined by a given relation between @xmath34 and @xmath45 , for instance @xmath99 , in this plane we can graphically determine as many points on this curve as we want . if we select the data determined in this way the result is a scaling law with index @xmath74 as the one in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the only difference is that now the procedure is numerical all the way .",
    "in this letter we have explained that scaling laws for a group of observations of oscillating loops to discriminate between different damping mechanisms are of not much use if there is no a priori information on the properties of the loops .",
    "the analytical expressions obtained by the tttb approximation enable us to show in a straightforward and easy to follow manner that in the framework of resonant absorption collections of synthetic data can be produced that follow almost any scaling law .",
    "then , we have backed up our findings by numerical eigenvalue computations that do not suffer from the tttb limitations but are on their own rather less instructive .",
    "it might be argued that nature is not as cunning as the authors of this paper and does not attempt to engineer data according to prescribed rules as those defined in these equations . on the other hand , there is no reason why nature would want to produce coronal loops that all have the same values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "so , unless there is accurate a priori information on the coronal loops available , the use of scaling laws to discriminate between different damping mechanisms is questionable , to say the least .",
