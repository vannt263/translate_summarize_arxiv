    "we have been in the midst of a remarkable outpouring of results from the cmb since 1999 .",
    "the royal society discussion meeting focused on the eight pre - wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( pre - wmap ) announcements made in 2002 .",
    "the wmap release was three weeks later , and a before - wmap discussion without an after - wmap discussion is unthinkable now .",
    "this paper applies the same methods of analysis to wmap as to the earlier cmb experiments to put its singular forward step into context . in   [ sec : cmbdata ] , we describe the different experiments that have contributed to the evolving picture . for more background material on methods and references , see 95 , 01 , bond  ( 2003a , b ) , 02 , 02  and 02 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cloptmar03 ] shows how the cmb power spectrum , @xmath26 defined in terms of cmb temperature anisotropy multipoles @xmath27 , changed from the pre - wmap determination shown at the royal society meeting using the data to january 2003 to the post - wmap determination of march 2003 ; the agreement is excellent .",

    "this story is a convergence with decreasing errors over time on the values of the cosmological parameters given in figures  [ fig:2djan000203mar03 ] , [ fig:1dwkflatlss ] and table  [ tab : exptparams ] .",
    "spectra for the pre - wmap   data and the post - wmap   data show good agreement .",
    "these spectra are maximum - likelihood determinations of the power in 26 ( top - hat ) bands , with calibration and beam uncertainties of the various experiments fully taken into account .",

    "the degree of compression does not do visual justice to wmap because the errors are so small until beyond the second peak .",

    "our philosophy has been to consider minimal models first , then see how progressive relaxation of the constraints on the inflation models , at the expense of increasing baroqueness , causes the parameter errors to open up .",

    "the evolution of the parameter errors was not that strong after   until wmap .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 model space is restrictive for inflation - based models , with high @xmath1 intimately related to lower @xmath1 . on the other hand , when the experiments were treated individually ( always with cobe - dmr ) , their @xmath45 contours were all circling the bulls - eyes ( sievers  2003 ) .     likelihood - contour regions , with the weak+lss prior probability applied in the top - left - hand panel , and the flat @xmath46=1 applied additionally in the rest .",

    "the total matter density is @xmath54 another two parameters characterize the transport from decoupling to the present , the vacuum or dark energy , encoded in a cosmological constant @xmath31 , and the curvature energy @xmath55 .",
    "of course @xmath47 also determines the mean geometry .",
    "( when one wishes to focus on what the cmb can tell us about the nature of the dark energy , another parameter is often added , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the pressure and density of the dark energy .",
    "if the vacuum or dark energy is reinterpreted as @xmath59 , the energy in a scalar field @xmath60 which dominates at late times , it would be likely to have complex dynamics associated with it . in that case , @xmath60 and @xmath20 would have spatial and temporal variations ( except if @xmath61 , the cosmological constant case ) . spatial fluctuations of @xmath60 are expected to leave a direct imprint on the cmb for small @xmath1 .",

    "we expect @xmath70 . at the moment , even with wmap , the cmb total anisotropy ( tt ) alone does not give such a constraint .",
    "it is the cross correlation of total anisotropy with polarization ( te ) that leads to a detection ( kogut  2003 ) .",

    "the amplitude ratio @xmath80 is related to @xmath81 to lowest order , with @xmath82 corrections at higher order ( 95 ) .",
    "there are also useful limiting cases for the @xmath83 relation . with   data , and",
    "even with wmap , the data are not powerful enough to determine much about the gw contribution , the wmap team estimate the gravitational wave ( tensor ) contribution to be less than @xmath84 of the scalar component in amplitude at the 95% cl .    as one allows the baroqueness of the inflation models to increase , one can entertain essentially any power spectrum .",
    "this implies a fully @xmath85-dependent @xmath39 if one is artful enough in designing inflaton potential surfaces .",
    "the simple model @xmath86 \\ , \\ln ( k / k_n)\\ ,    \\nonumber\\ ] ] adds a logarithmic running index about a pivot scale @xmath74 . as figure",
    "[ fig : cloptmar03 ] and   [ sec : params ] indicate , this improves the fit to the data .",
    "it is also expected in inflation models , it is just a question of the size of the correction .    the tensor index @xmath87 could also be a function , although it does not have as much freedom as @xmath39 in inflation .",
    "for example , it is difficult to get @xmath87 to be positive .",
    "one can also have more types of modes present , scalar isocurvature modes .",
    "the data have shown for quite a while that these would have to be subdominant relative to the scalar curvature modes , and would have to be even more so now .",
    "each experiment also contributes a parameter describing the uncertainty in the calibration , and possibly another for the uncertainty in the beam size .      in gaussian models defined by a parameter set @xmath88 ,",
    "the probability distribution of the primary anisotropies is fully encoded in the isotropic power spectrum @xmath89  as long as there is no preferred orientation ( as might occur for small universes that are topologically nontrivial ) .",
    "the observed bandpowers for an individual experiment can then be tested against theoretical bandpowers @xmath90 , which are averages of the @xmath6 s over @xmath1-space ` window functions ' @xmath91 appropriate to the bands for the experiment in question .",
    "this represents a huge compression of the entire dataset and makes large model space computations feasible .",
    "to use this information to estimate cosmological parameters , the entire likelihood surface as a function of the @xmath92 is needed with sufficient accuracy that the parameter estimations are not biased .",
    "it has been shown that individual bandpowers @xmath42 have distributions well characterized by a lognormal distribution in the variable @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is an estimate of the noise in the band ( 00 ) .",
    "the coupling between bandpowers is included as a weak correction , relying on the band - to - band correlations being relatively small  a demand imposed in the data analysis phase .",
    "what comes out are entropies , @xmath95 , log likelihoods .",
    "a slightly modified version of this prescription is used for wmap (; see also   [ sec : cmbdata][sec : mar03 ] . )",
    "there are two approaches to sampling the set @xmath88 that we have used .",
    "the main workhorse throughout our analyses up to   used fixed grids : a discrete set of parameter values are chosen _ a priori _ for six of the seven cosmic variables , with spacings in each of the dimensions designed by hand to be adaptively concentrated about the most probable values , but with sufficient spread to ensure that tails and multiple solution regions are well explored .",
    "the current database for the ` minimal inflation ' parameter model contains @xmath96 models , with dimensions @xmath97 for the ` external parameter ' set @xmath98 , with edge cutouts requiring @xmath99 .",
    "the seventh ( amplitude ) parameter , @xmath100 or @xmath77 , and the experimental calibration and beam uncertainty variables are continuous .",
    "they relax to their maximum - likelihood values , with errors characterized by the second derivative of the likelihood function .",
    "the number of these ` internal ' continuous parameters may become much larger if we split the amplitude parameter into many , one for each band in @xmath1-space ( or @xmath85-space if three - dimensional power spectra are the target ) .",
    "the shape @xmath101 of an assumed spectrum multiplies the adopted window functions for the bands . for the optimal bandpowers that combine experiments together in figure  [ fig : cloptevoln ] , @xmath101 is usually varied to test robustness of the results , but an ensemble of external parameter models can be applied ,  in broken scale - invariance applications in @xmath85-space .    the first stage output is large entropy files that include maximum - likelihood values and fisher matrices for the internal variables .",
    "these files are then picked up in postprocessing as various prior probabilities are applied , marginalizations are done , and one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) statistics are computed .",
    "an advantage of a fixed grid is that it has allowed us to quickly check many prior cases and many experimental combinations , all on the same footing .",
    "calibration uncertainties are handled either at the entropy stage with the complete experimental mix , or in postprocessing , since we know the amplitude distributions . when analysing an experiment , these operations are done again and again , as different hypotheses ,",
    "band widths and positionings , estimation techniques , source removal methods , , are applied to the bandpowers for the experiments in question , so speed is essential .",
    "combining dmr with the experiments was always a first step ; now wmap takes that role .    as new experiments are added which are qualitative improvements ( like wmap )",
    ", errors may become smaller than grid spacings and further adaptivity of the grid is needed .",
    "this is so even with good interpolations and smoothing .",
    "we set a floor on parameter errors to be half the grid spacing of the encompassed grid : a value that was never reached before wmap but has been with wmap for a few parameters strongly bundled into the top few parameter eigenmodes and some priors .",
    "the second approach is the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method (; ; ; ; ) .",
    "it develops a set of independent chains , each a small ( unstructured ) grid on the parameter space that is constructed ` on the fly ' rather than _ a priori_. the elements of the chains are sampled according to well - developed mcmc algorithms designed to make the next step independent of prior ones .",
    "the spacing of the models computed changes with experimental combinations and priors adopted . as with the fixed - grid methods ,",
    "some priors can be applied in postprocessing , which speeds up the procedure .",
    "these mcmc methods have now become feasible for cmb analyses because the @xmath102 computations with cmbfast ( ) or camb ( ) are efficient algorithmically , and are rapid enough on large numbers of models because of the remarkable speedup of individual computer processors in recent years .",
    "a nice fortran 90 package is publicly available to do this ( ) . to do the statistics",
    "well , one needs not just many elements in a chain , but a number of chains .",
    "thus it was really the advent of massively parallel machines that is allowing mcmc to become a major working tool for repetitive cmb and lss analyses .",
    "for example , it is the method adopted by the wmap team (; ) , who applied it to the minimal six - parameter flat model , with the amplitude as an external parameter , and seven - parameter models with the @xmath47 , @xmath20 , @xmath103 or @xmath81 allowed to vary in turn .",
    "they ran four chains and about 30000 models per chain to define their distributions .",
    "we have adapted cosmomc to the parameter choices and ranges of our @xmath0 database , and the many prior cases and experimental combinations used , to facilitate comparisons ; @xmath29 can go out as far as 0.7 , which ensures likelihood drop - off to zero , but places sampling challenges .",
    "the major challenge for mcmc is to sample well the curved likelihood ridges at reasonable computational cost .",
    "certain nonlinear combinations of our basic variables can help to straighten out the likelihood surfaces , in particular those with highly asymmetric errors , allow for more efficient and accurate computation , whether they be used in mcmc ( 02 ; 03 ; ) or for fixed or adaptive grids .",
    "for mcmc , another approach is to use variance matrices from small runs to make the steps efficient in the parameter space ( ) . for each experimental mix and prior , we use 16 chains run until convergence tests are satisfied for all of the variables . in spite of processor speed ,",
    "the computations remain a challenge if many cases need to be run .",
    "the parameter grids are chosen to be wide relative to conceivable cosmological models , yet are concentrated in the maximum - likelihood regions .",
    "the mcmc chains are allowed to vary over wide domains , and they automatically concentrate well .",
    "an important issue is the prior measure we impose upon the parameter space .",
    "implicit in the adoption of a given variable set is that a uniform prior probability is chosen in each of the variables .",
    "if a variable is not well determined this can have a big influence ( 00 ) .",
    "we usually present the cosmological conclusions we draw from our analyses of the various cmb experiments using noncontroversial priors , ones that almost all cosmologists would agree to .",
    "thus our standard weak one used in lange  ( 2001 ) and subsequent works requires only @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the addition of the flat prior has also become benign , thanks to the sharpness of the @xmath106 determination with the cmb rather than to the predilections of inflation theorists .",
    "( although a major reduction in number of database models occurs when the flat @xmath107 prior is applied , it is usually applied in the postprocessing phase . )",
    "data from sources other than the cmb can be incorporated as ` prior probabilities ' .",
    "a stronger prior on the hubble parameter , hst - h , uses an @xmath108 gaussian distribution ( 01 ) .",
    "sn1 data imposes a prior in @xmath31-@xmath47-@xmath20 space ( ) .",
    "the cmb data apparently determine @xmath50 to higher accuracy than light - element - abundance observations coupled to big bang nucleosynthesis theory ( 03 ) , hence applying a bbn prior is not of much interest .",
    "the lss prior we use ( 98 ; 00 ; 02 ) also depends upon our parameter set .",
    "an important combination is the wavenumber of the horizon when the energy density in relativistic particles equals the energy density in nonrelativistic particles : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",
    "we represent the ( linear ) density power spectrum by a single shape parameter : @xmath111\\ ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ] works reasonably well , to about 3% over the region most relevant to lss ; replacing @xmath112 by @xmath113 takes into account the main effect of spectral tilt over the lss wavenumber band ( 95 ) . for low redshift clusters ,",
    "the abundances determine a combination that is roughly @xmath114 ( with the degeneracy among the combination broken with high redshift cluster information ) .",
    "weak lensing determines a similar combination .    with the wealth of data emerging from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the 2df redshift survey ( 2dfrs ) , shape is a very powerful probe .",
    "however , the biasing of the galaxy distribution with respect to the mass becomes an issue if it is scale dependent , inviting caution  and for our purposes a weakened prior over what the data formally show . in the future ,",
    "weak lensing should allow shape and amplitude to be simultaneously constrained without biasing uncertainties .    to be explicit , our prior for @xmath115 is of form @xmath116=@xmath117 , distributed as a gaussian ( first error ) smeared by a uniform ( tophat ) distribution ( second error ) .",
    "this straddles most of the values determined from weak lensing and many of those estimated from cluster abundances ( shown in figure  [ fig : sig8evoln ] ) .",
    "we have also used a prior shifted downward by 15% to accommodate the lower values quoted for clusters in the literature .",
    "our prior for the shape parameter is @xmath118=@xmath119 , which encompasses the recent sdss and 2dfrs results as well as results from the automated plate measuring ( apm ) angular survey and earlier redshift surveys . fully embracing the 2dfrs galaxy power spectrum with a linear bias model to relate it to the total density power",
    "gives a stronger shape constraint , @xmath120=@xmath121 .",
    "although some sdss estimates are quite consistent , @xmath118=@xmath122 , different analysis methods and different datasets give wider ranges and the estimates do not incorporate possible complexities in the bias model .",
    "thus , we have adopted a weak - lss as opposed to a strong - lss prior .",
    "since @xmath112 @xmath123 , with the improved cmb estimations of @xmath124 that arose in the   ( and later ) datasets , the shape constraint now has some similarity to an @xmath125 prior (   [ sec : params ] ) .",
    "values of @xmath126 , @xmath112 and @xmath41 as estimated from the cmb data are given in table  [ tab : exptparams ] .",
    "they are basically compatible with the lss priors .",
    "one can get @xmath127 from the @xmath112 and @xmath34 results in the table .",
    "one of the most exciting results from wmap was the te cross - correlation of the e - mode of polarization and the total intensity ( t ) at low @xmath1 , interpreted as evidence for a @xmath128 detection , determined with a ` model independent ' method by kogut  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the detection is not nearly as strong when ensemble - averaged over model space for the weak prior , as described in ",
    "[ sec : params ] .",
    "the te result is explicitly included in the cosmomc treatment , but only tt is included in the @xmath0 database used here . to incorporate the detection , we have constructed a @xmath29 prior , chosen to be broader than a @xmath129 gaussian , @xmath130 in terms of gaussian and top - hat errors . the mcmc results for @xmath29 we obtain when other parameters are marginalized is broader still , on both sides , and so we compare parameter estimates with and without this prior and find for most it makes little difference it does have an effect on marginalized amplitude determinations , in particular skewing somewhat the @xmath41 distribution to higher values .",
    "sometimes there is ` tension ' between the parameters estimated from cmb - only and those including non - cmb priors .",
    "this is extremely important to flag , since poor distribution overlap leads to smaller combined errors .",
    "one is tempted to open up parameter space to a much larger set .",
    "there was a good reason for limiting the number in the pre - wmap days : the spectra may not change much as the parameters vary , manifested by near - degeneracies among them .",
    "it is useful to disentangle the degeneracies by making linear combinations which diagonalize the error correlation matrix @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and the averages are over the probability - weighted ensemble of models .",
    "these ` parameter eigenmodes ' ( 95 ; ; 00 ; 02 ) @xmath133 the error on the eigenmode @xmath134 , @xmath135 , is determined by the data and the priors .",
    "( instead of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we use @xmath138 and @xmath139 in the combinations so their errors are relative and quantitatively meaningful relative to the other variables . )    until the wmap data , only four combinations of our seven could be determined within @xmath140 accuracy with the cmb ( five with cmb+lss ) , but with wmap precision , for the   data , five can be determined ( six with cmb+lss ) , and two are determined to better than @xmath141 .",
    "parameter eigenmodes arising from the current data are discussed further in   [ sec : params][sec : eigen ] .",
    "thus , wmap precision gives us licence to open up the parameter space more .",
    "here we only do this to a limited extent , by restricting ourselves to flat universes and replacing @xmath46 by @xmath20 or by @xmath142 .",
    "both mcmc and fixed - grid approaches can have difficulty when the eigenmodes are precisely determined . using variables which are nonlinear combinations of the @xmath143 motivated by the eigenmodes can aid with this , one characterizing the peak / dip pattern ( the sound - crossing scale ) and one the amplitude-@xmath29-@xmath34 near - degeneracy .",
    "both degeneracies were exploited in limiting our @xmath0 database storage requirements .",
    "expressing the lss prior in terms of @xmath144 and @xmath145 only ( 02 ; 00 ; 98 ) is similar in spirit to keeping only the best determined ` eigenmode ' from the redshift surveys and from the lensing or cluster surveys .",
    "however , the same mechanism that gives the acoustic peaks in @xmath0 leads to oscillations in the density power for large @xmath146 ; further eigenstructure that would be revealed with high precision shape data .",
    "similarly extra variables such as @xmath52 also lead to more eigenstructure .",
    "higher redshift observations also break the @xmath147 near - degeneracy .",
    "there were ` seven pillars ' of the inflation paradigm that we were looking for in the cmb probe :    \\(1 ) the effects of a large scale gravitational potential at low multipoles ;    \\(2 ) the pattern of acoustic peaks and dips ;    \\(3 ) damping ;    \\(4 ) gaussianity ( maximal randomness for a given power spectrum ) of the primary anisotropies ;    \\(5 ) secondary anisotropies associated with nonlinear phenomena , due to the sz thermal and kinetic effects , inhomogeneous reionization , weak lensing , ;    \\(6 ) polarization , which must be there at the   @xmath148 level , along with a specific cross - correlation with the total intensity ;    \\(7 ) anisotropies and the associated polarization induced by gravity wave quantum noise .",
    "at least five , and possibly six , of these have been seen .",
    "we have known about pillar 1 since cobe and firs , and found pillars 2 and 3 in the past few years , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : analysis][sec : lsldlpkphenom],[sec : lsldlpk ] .",
    "most , but not all , inflation models predict gaussianity of the primary cmb fluctuations ( pillar 4 ) .",
    "this has been demonstrated to varying degrees with cobe , maxima , boomerang , the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) and now with wmap data .",
    "all secondary anisotropies and galactic foregrounds will be non - gaussian , so care must be taken in interpreting the inevitable deviations from gaussianity .",
    "the cbi , the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( ) and the berkeley illinois maryland array ( bima ) may have seen evidence for the thermal sz effect , an aspect of pillar 5 ( see    [ sec : cmbdata][sec : sec ] and [ sec : params][sec : margparam ] ) .",
    "polarization ( pillar 6 , see   [ sec : cmbdata][sec : pol ] ) , has been convincingly demonstrated .",
    "first there was the broadband detection by dasi of ee polarization and its te cross - correlation with total intensity , at levels consistent with inflation models",
    ". then wmap unveiled the te cross - correlation spectrum to @xmath149 .",
    "the enhancement at @xmath150 is the evidence for @xmath151 and an associated redshift of reionization @xmath152 .",
    "the wmap anticorrelation in te observed at @xmath153 is interpreted as proof that the dominant component of the perturbations giving rise to this effect is adiabatic .",
    "pillar 7 is an extreme experimental challenge , and some inflation models have gravity wave induced anisotropies too small for them ever be detected ( see   [ sec : cmbdata][sec : pol ] ) .",
    "we were dealing with upper limits on anisotropies until the 1990s .",
    "these limits were useful in ruling out broad ranges of theoretical possibilities .",
    "then the familiar @xmath154 multipoles at the @xmath155 level were revealed by cobe .",

    "analysing cmb experiments involves a pipeline that takes the raw detector timestreams or visibilities from correlators for interferometers , flags and cleans them , and usually generates maps , from which bandpowers and higher order statistics are derived , ideally after separating component signals by using their differing frequency and spatial dependences . the step from bandpowers to cosmic parameters described in ",

    "the timestreams are turned into spatial maps for each frequency : an average temperature in each pixel and a pixel - pixel noise correlation matrix from which the bandpowers , noise in the bandpowers and band - band error matrices are derived .",
    "the first step is to extract the sky signal from the noise , using the only information we have , the pointing matrix mapping a bit in time onto a pixel position on the sky . in the analysis of boomerang , and subsequent work",
    "including for wmap , powerful use of monte carlo simulations was made to evaluate the power spectrum and other statistical indicators in maps with many more pixels than was possible with the conventional matrix methods described in 98  and borrill ( 1999 ) .    for interferometer experiments , the basic data are visibilities as a function of baseline and frequency , with contributions from random detector noise as well as from the sky signals .",
    "a baseline is a direct probe of a given angular wavenumber vector on the sky , and hence suggests that we should make ` generalized pixel ' maps in ` momentum space ' ( fourier transform space ) rather than in position space , as for boomerang . for cbi ,",
    "the @xmath225 visibility measurements of each field were ` optimally ' compressed into a @xmath226 coarse - grained lattice in momentum space from which the power spectrum was calculated using matrix methods ( 02 ) .",
    "the important step of separating multi - frequency timestream data into the physical components on the sky is fundamental , still under active development , and will remain so for a long time , as our precision increases .",
    "the sources are the primary cmb , the thermal and kinetic sz effects , the dust , synchrotron and bremsstrahlung galactic signals , the extragalactic radio and sub - millimetre sources , possibly spinning dust , and of course the sources we have not thought of yet .",
    "an example is the treatment of point sources : at the high resolution of cbi and its 30 ghz frequency , the contribution from extragalactic radio sources is significant , so known point sources were projected out of the visibilities by using a large number of constraint - template matrices which marginalize over all affected modes , using positions from the ( 1.4 ghz ) national radio observatory very large array sky survey ( nvss ) catalog ( 02b ) . even though the wmap resolution is substantially lower than that of cbi , wmap cut out some 700 sources in its analysis .",
    "boomerang cut out three quasars .    for extended sources ,",
    "the most expedient method is to just cut out problematic areas , with galactic latitude cuts to remove emission from the plane , as was done for dmr , wmap and boomerang .",
    "extensive use is also made of templates that come from galactic observations , the iras / dirbe maps of sub - millimetre emission , hi maps , , and from the experiments themselves , with the highest and lowest frequency maps often being completely dominated by foregrounds ( as for the dust - dominated 400 ghz boomerang map ) .",
    "having errors on primary signal maps that reflect the residual contamination after separation is a priority to ensure that the precision is unbiased as well as high .",
    "the extension of these methods to polarization is under active development . for cbi , the polarization pipeline using generalizations of the 02 techniques has been implemented . for boomerang ,",
    "the basic tools being developed include a generalization of the signal - noise separator used in boomerang-98 ( prunet  2001 ; dore   2002 ) , and a variety of power spectrum estimators such as spice ( correlation function techniques ( chon   2003 ) ) , faster ( approximate @xmath1-space techniques ( 01 ; 02 ) ) and madcap ( full matrix methods ( borrill 1999 ) ) .",

    "we find the same result with the database with mcmc : @xmath34 changes by about 0.03 from wmap - only to the   set for the weak+flat prior , and by a further 0.015 with lss added .    modelling @xmath34 variation with a logarithmic correction ,  get @xmath34 varying from 1.2 to 0.93 .",

    "prior choices on @xmath29 can then move the limits around : the weak+flat results in table  [ tab : exptparamsmcmc ] place no restriction beyond the weak 0.7 upper boundary on @xmath29 to conform mcmc to our database limit .",

    "our weak+flat+lss prior does not give a good constraint .",
    "since the shape parameter @xmath261 , and @xmath124 is now accurately determined by the cmb data , our shape constraint approaches a pure @xmath125 prior . for @xmath262 , it is similar to the weak limits we are already imposing on @xmath125 .",
    "the 2dfrs data give @xmath263 and the sdss data give @xmath264 , so the combination would nomimally have an 11% relative gaussian error , the same as for the hst - h prior , suggesting the constraint would be similar if this strong - lss were to be imposed .    why the limits are typically @xmath265 or @xmath266 with sn1 is easy to understand : the @xmath45 sn1 error contour in the @xmath59@xmath20 plane roughly follows a @xmath260 @xmath267 line , where @xmath268 is the current deceleration parameter . with @xmath269 , this gives the -0.7 to -0.8 range for the limit . the way the cmb comes into this is to restrict the allowed values of @xmath59 , and it used to be that the data was such that the lss prior was needed to do this the first time we went through this exercise .",
    "the addition of wmap refines @xmath59 but this only fine tunes the limit by a small amount .",

    "( these @xmath41 differences , plus @xmath278 excursions in @xmath34 , represent the biggest deviations between compressed and uncompressed wmap estimations ; and the up and down 1@xmath279 and 2@xmath279 limits are close . )",
    "the sz effect breaks the @xmath41-@xmath29 degeneracy .",
    "the sz power spectrum is found to scale as @xmath280 about a @xmath28cdm model with @xmath281 ( 02 ) .",
    "this high non - linearity means that it could be an excellent way to estimate @xmath41 . for an sz explanation to work for",
    "the ( recalibrated ) cbi+bima+  data seems to require @xmath282 with 1@xmath279 errors which include the non - gaussian nature of the sz effect in the small patches that the cbi deep and bima measurements probe ( 02 ) .",
    "these sz distributions overlap with those found for the cmb and cmb+lss data , but the jury is still out on whether this is the explanation .",
    "the calculation of the sz angular power spectrum requires detailed hydrodynamical simulations that properly take into account cluster structure , pressure profiles , heating / cooling ,  there are still uncertainties as to the role of feedback , and much work is needed on the theoretical side as well as the observational side to turn this technique into a high - precision tool .      to help break parameter near - degeneracies via cmb alone",

    "this does not mean inflation is proved , but competitor theories would have to look awfully like inflation for them to work . as cmb precision increases at high @xmath1 , and more polarization data arrive , and as the lss and sn1 data improve , more details with more parameters will be explored .",
