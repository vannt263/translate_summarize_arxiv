    "as mentioned above , all atoms in the 2d - pc allotropes are threefold coordinated , similar to the planar honeycomb lattice of graphene .",

    "the main difference becomes apparent in the top view . whereas @xmath8 structures contain ethylene - like c@xmath2 units that are interconnected by p@xmath2 dimers , @xmath9 systems contain contiguous trans - polyacetylene - like all - carbon chains that are separated by p - chains . due to the difference between the locally planar @xmath0 bonding of c atoms and locally non - planar @xmath1 bonding of p atoms , and due to the difference between equilibrium c - c and p - p bond lengths ,",
    "the hexagons found in @xmath8 structures change to pentagon - heptagon pairs in the optimum @xmath9 structure resembling pentheptite or haeckelite structures related to graphitic carbon . as seen in fig .",

    "we also note that the @xmath12 phase is slightly more stable than the @xmath11 phase of pc .",
    "the stability advantage of @xmath12-pc derives from the larger variational freedom within the unit cell , which allows to distinguish two different p sites ( p@xmath19 and p@xmath2 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "additional support for the plausibility of the bonding configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] comes from the equilibrium bond lengths , which are listed in table  [ table1 ] . with the exception of @xmath7 structures , the bond lengths depend primarily on @xmath6 and are rather insensitive to the phase ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 structures ,",

    "the electronic band structure and associated density of states ( dos ) of @xmath7 systems is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) suggest that @xmath12-pc is an indirect - gap semiconductor with a band gap of @xmath33  ev . in stark contrast , the structurally similar @xmath11-pc allotrope is metallic according to fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "as suggested earlier , all bonds and electronic configurations are frustrated in @xmath11-pc , with all c sites engaging only three valence electrons in @xmath0-like bonds , leaving one lone electron behind , and the angle at the p ridge being too large for typical @xmath1 bonding .",
    "this finding , in particular the presence of a non - bonding electron in the c@xmath34 orbital , is seen in the frontier states of @xmath11-pc that are depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "@xmath12-pc is quite different from @xmath11-pc , as it contains two inequivalent p and c sites . the p@xmath19 site at the ridge displays the favored @xmath1 bonding characteristic and its lone pair orbital is present in the frontier state displayed in the right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "in contrast , the bonding is very different at the p@xmath2 site , where the lone pair orbital does not contribute to the frontier state . the flat bonding geometry near this site is reminiscent of @xmath0 bonding at the c sites .",
    "the added flexibility provided by a larger unit cell allows for additional stabilization of @xmath12-pc due to the opening of a band gap , with vague analogy to the peierls instability .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and [ fig3](d ) , both @xmath15-pc and @xmath16-pc have a direct band gap , which we attribute to the presence of isolated ethylene - like units mentioned above .",
    "the two allotropes display a very similar charge distribution in their valence frontier states , which contain the lone pair orbitals on p sites and reflects @xmath0 bonding between c sites .",
    "the main difference between the two structures is that the 0.4  ev wide gap in @xmath15-pc is at the @xmath35 point , whereas the 0.3  ev gap in @xmath16-pc is at the @xmath36 point . in both structures ,",
    "the band dispersion is rather anisotropic near the top of the valence and bottom of the conduction band , which causes an anisotropy in the effective mass .",
    "we find the effective mass of both electrons and holes to be much smaller along @xmath31-direction than along the @xmath32-direction , which is reminiscent of the situation in black phosphorene  .",
    "the effective mass anisotropy offers a significant advantage in transport , since it combines high mobility of carriers with a large dos near the band edges .    according to fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) and [ fig3](f ) , also the two @xmath9 allotropes , @xmath17-pc and @xmath18-pc , share very similar band structure , dos and frontier orbitals due to structural similarities .",
    "the electronic structure of these systems is nevertheless very different from the other two categories , chiefly due to the presence of trans - polyacetylene - like chains mentioned above .",
    "both @xmath17-pc and @xmath18-pc display a dirac cone at the fermi level , at a crystal momentum between @xmath35 and @xmath37 . as mentioned before , the distinguishing feature of @xmath9 structures is the alternation between chains consisting of pure p or pure c atoms . fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) indicates that all p sites have occupied lone pair orbitals , which are also reflected in the frontier states .",
    "the p chains form ridges within the structure , with bond angles characteristic of @xmath1 bonding found in black phosphorus .",
    "the structure of the carbon chains , also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , resembles that of conjugated trans - polyacetylene or graphene with @xmath0 bonding , and the presence of c@xmath34 orbitals in the frontier states is clearly seen in the right - side panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3](e ) and [ fig3](f ) .",
    "differences between equilibrium bond length and bond angles of the p and c chains are accommodated by introducing pentagon - heptagon pairs .",
    "the conjugation within c chains and their suppressed dimerization caused by their bonding to adjacent p chains lies behind the formation of the dirac cone . due to the strong anisotropy in the system , caused by the direction of the trans - polyacetylene - like chains ,",
    "the dirac cone is anisotropic in the plane of the layer .",
    "we have found that uniaxial strain may be used to eliminate the anisotropy of the dirac cone , but will also change the location of the dirac point along the @xmath38 line .",
    "more information about the dirac cone is provided in the supporting information .",
    "even though dft - pbe calculations notoriously underestimate the fundamental band gap between occupied and unoccupied states , the calculated dispersion @xmath39*k*@xmath40 of individual bands is believed to closely resemble experimental values . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "we have also performed dft - hse06   calculations with a hybrid exchange - correlation functional for the same structures . as seen in the supporting information ,",
    "our dft - pbe and dft - hse06 results are closely related .",
    "in particular , dft - hse06 opens the band gap in semiconducting @xmath12-pc , @xmath15-pc and @xmath16-pc structures , but keeps the metallic character of @xmath11-pc and the semi - metallic character of @xmath17-pc and @xmath18-pc .",
    "similar to other non - planar 2d systems like phosphorene , pc is susceptible to even minute in - plane stress , which can cause major distortions in the geometry , affecting the electronic structure and bonding . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we have determined the effect of tensile and compressive strain on the stability and the fundamental band gap in the different pc allotropes and present the results in fig .",
    "we have considered uniaxial strain along the @xmath31- and the @xmath32-direction , defined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . since all allotropes discussed here are non - planar , applying in - layer strain changes the effective thickness of the layers and vice versa .",
    "as expected , layer thickness is reduced under tensile strain and increased under compressive strain . for strain values below 5%",
    ", we have observed changes in layer thickness of up to 10% .",
    "the distinct structural anisotropy , best seen in the side views , translates into a distinct anisotropy of the strain energy with respect to the strain direction , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "similar to black phosphorene , the system appears soft when strained along the @xmath31-direction normal to the ridges and valleys , whereas it is much stiffer when distorted along the @xmath32-direction .",
    "we find the @xmath21 phase to be particularly soft in the @xmath31-direction , with compressive or tensile strain requiring @xmath415  mev / atom in strain energy .",
    "the dependence of the fundamental band gap on the in - layer strain , as obtained by our dft - pbe calculations , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "we find that compression along the soft @xmath31-direction does not affect the band gap much , quite unlike what is expected to occur in black phosphorene  @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from our results for strain along the stiffer @xmath32-direction .",
    "there , we observe the fundamental band gap to disappear at compressive strain exceeding 4% for @xmath15-pc and 3% for @xmath16-pc .",
    "we also find that the metallic character of @xmath11-pc and semi - metallic character of @xmath17-pc and @xmath18-pc are not affected by tensile or compressive strains up to 5% applied along the @xmath31- or the @xmath32-direction .",
    "since vertical strain causing a 10% reduction of the layer thickness is equivalent to an effective tensile in - layer strain below 5% , we can judge its effect on the electronic structure based on the above findings .",
    "even though the cohesive energy of the 2d structures presented here exceeds that of previously discussed pc systems , the calculated cohesive energy of per formula unit still falls @xmath42  ev short of the sum of the cohesive energies of pure black phosphorene , @xmath43  ev , and pure graphene , @xmath44  ev . even though the pc allotropes discussed here are all stable , as seen in the vibration spectra presented in the supporting information , the slight energetic preference for pure components in favor of the pc compound should offer challenges in the synthesis .",
    "we believe that recent advances in supramolecular assembly may solve this problem .",
    "similar to our requirements , precisely designed structures including graphdiyne  , graphene nanoribbons  @xcite and carbon nanotubes  @xcite have been assembled using wet chemical processes from specific molecular precursors . in the same way",
    ", we expect that the postulated 2d - pc structures may be formed of proper molecular precursors that contain @xmath0 bonded carbon and @xmath1 bonded phosphorus .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed _ ab initio _ density functional calculations and identified previously unknown allotropes of phosphorus carbide ( pc ) in the stable shape of an atomically thin layer .",
    "we found that different non - planar stable geometries , which result from the competition between @xmath0 bonding found in graphitic c and @xmath1 bonding found in black p , may be mapped onto 2d tiling patterns that simplify categorizing of the structures .",
    "we have introduced the structural category @xmath6 , defined by the number of like nearest neighbors ranging from 0 to 2 , and found that @xmath6 correlates with the stability and the electronic structure characteristic .",
    "we found structures of the @xmath7 category to be either metallic , or to reconstruct spontaneously to a more stable structure with a larger unit cell and a sizeable fundamental gap .",
    "systems of the @xmath8 category are more stable than @xmath7 systems , display a significant , direct band gap and a significant anisotropy of the effective mass of carriers .",
    "category @xmath9 systems are the most stable of all , are semi - metallic , and display an anisotropic dirac cone at the fermi level . due to their non - planar character",
    ", all systems can sustain in - layer strain at little energy cost .",
    "the fundamental band gap is not very sensitive to strain in most systems with the exception of @xmath8 allotropes , where it closes upon applying compressive strain of @xmath45% along the ridges and valleys .",
    "we use _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the siesta  @xcite code to obtain insight into the equilibrium structure , stability and electronic properties of 2d - pc allotropes reported in the main manuscript .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used throughout the study , with monolayers represented by a periodic array of slabs separated by a 15   thick vacuum region .",
    "we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite exchange - correlation functional , norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials  @xcite , and a double-@xmath46 basis including polarization orbitals .",
    "the reciprocal space is sampled by a fine grid  @xcite of @xmath47  @xmath48-points in the brillouin zone of the primitive unit cell of 4 atoms or its equivalent in supercells .",
    "siesta calculations use a mesh cutoff energy of @xmath49  ry to determine the self - consistent charge density , which provides us with a precision in total energy of @xmath50  mev / atom .",
    "all geometries have been optimized using the conjugate gradient method  @xcite , until none of the residual hellmann - feynman forces exceeded @xmath51  ev /  .",
    "since the fundamental band gap is usually underestimated in dft - pbe calculations , we have resorted to the hse06   hybrid exchange - correlation functional , as implemented in the vasp  @xcite code , to get a different ( possibly superior ) description of the band structure .",

    "<S> a large number of substances with unique advantages and limitations has been studied in this respect , but consensus has not been reached regarding the optimum candidate . </S>",
    "<S> semi - metallic graphene with an excellent carrier mobility has received the most attention so far , but all attempts to open up a sizeable , robust , and reproducible band gap have failed due to the negative side effects of the different modifications  . </S>",
    "<S> transition metal dichalchogenides ( tmds ) such as mos@xmath2   or tcs@xmath2  @xcite do have a sizeable fundamental band gap , but a lower carrier mobility . </S>",
    "<S> recently isolated few - layer films of black phosphorus , including phosphorene monolayers , combine high carrier mobility with a sizeable and tunable fundamental band gap  , but have limited stability in air  @xcite .    since both elemental carbon and phosphorus form stable 2d monolayers , which have been studied extensively , it is intriguing to find out , whether the compound phosphorus carbide ( pc ) , </S>",
    "<S> also called carbon phosphide , may also be stable as a monolayer and display properties that may even be superior to both constituents . </S>",
    "<S> the plausibility of a 2d structure of pc derives from the same three - fold coordination found both in graphene and phosphorene . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the 2d structure will likely suffer from a competition between the planar @xmath0 bonding characteristic of graphene and the significantly different non - planar @xmath1 bonding found in phosphorene . </S>",
    "<S> the postulated 2d structure of pc with 1:1 stoichiometry is fundamentally different from the amorphous structure observed in deposited thin solid films  @xcite , the postulated foam - like 3d structure  @xcite , or the postulated gase - like multi - layer structures of pc containing c and p with the same @xmath1 hybridization  . on the other hand , 2d allotropes of pc </S>",

    "<S> @xcite in this letter , based on _ ab initio _ density functional calculations , we propose previously unknown allotropes of phosphorus carbide in the stable shape of an atomically thin layer . </S>",
    "<S> we find that different stable geometries , which result from the competition between @xmath0 bonding found in graphitic c and @xmath1 bonding found in black p , may be mapped onto 2d tiling patterns that simplify categorizing of the structures . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the structural category @xmath6 , defined by the number of like nearest neighbors , and find that @xmath6 correlates with the stability and the electronic structure characteristic . depending on the category , we identify 2d - pc structures that can be metallic , semi - metallic with an anisotropic dirac cone , or direct - gap semiconductors with their gap tunable by in - layer strain . </S>"
