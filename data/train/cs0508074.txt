    "gupta and kumar @xcite introduced a random network model for studying throughput scaling in a fixed wireless network ( that is , when the nodes do not move ) .",
    "they defined a random network to consist of @xmath3 nodes where each node is distributed uniformly and independently on the unit sphere in @xmath4 .",
    "the network has @xmath5 distinct source - destination pairs formed at random .",
    "each node can transmit at @xmath6 bits - per - second provided that the interference is sufficiently small .",
    "they showed that in such a random network the throughput scales as @xmath7 per source - destination ( s - d ) pair .",
    "grossglauser and tse @xcite showed that by allowing the nodes to move , the throughput scaling changes dramatically . indeed ,",
    "if node motion is independent across nodes and has a uniform stationary distribution , a constant throughput scaling ( @xmath0 ) per s - d pair is feasible .",
    "this raised the question : what kind of mobility is necessary for achieving constant throughput scaling ?",
    "diggavi , grossglauser and tse @xcite considered a restricted mobility model where each node is allowed to move along a randomly chosen great circle on the unit sphere with a uniform stationary distribution along the great circle .",
    "they showed that a constant throughput per s - d pair is feasible even with this restricted mobility model .",
    "thus they established that node motion with a stationary distribution on the entire network area is not necessary for achieving constant throughput scaling .",
    "el gamal , mammen , prabhakar and shah @xcite ( see @xcite for complete details ) determined the throughput - delay trade - off for both fixed and mobile wireless networks .",
    "in particular , it was shown that for mobile networks at throughput of @xmath0 , the delay is @xmath8 . for mobile networks ,",
    "the mobility model consisted of each node moving independently according to a symmetric random walk on a @xmath9 grid on the unit torus .",
    "the constant throughput scaling result of @xcite for a network with restricted mobility raises the question whether the high throughput in spite of restricted mobility is at the expense of increased delay .",
    "motivated by this question , we study the delay scaling for constant throughput scaling in a network with restricted mobility . somewhat surprisingly , we find that delay scaling is not affected by this mobility restriction either .",
    "that is , delay scales as @xmath8 , which is the same as the delay scaling when mobility is not restricted .",
    "this paper is a consolidation of the preliminary work presented in @xcite .",
    "this seemingly surprising result can be explained as follows .",
    "since there are @xmath3 nodes in a network of constant area , the neighborhood of each node is @xmath10 .",
    "based on this , let us say that two nodes _ meet _ or are _ neighbors _ when they are within a distance of @xmath11 .",
    "the following condition ensures constant throughput scaling in the mobile network models presented in @xcite , @xcite and this paper : _ for @xmath10 fraction of the time , each node is a neighbor of every other node with only @xmath0 other nodes in its neighborhood_. this ensures that the total network throughput is @xmath12 and that it is distributed evenly among the @xmath5 s - d pairs , so that the throughput is @xmath0 .",
    "delay is determined by the first and second moments of the inter - meeting time of the nodes . in the case of unrestricted mobility",
    ", the inter - meeting time of any two nodes is equivalent to the inter - visit time to state @xmath13 for a 2-d random walk on a @xmath14 grid . in the restricted mobility case",
    "also the inter - meeting time turns out to be equivalent to the inter - visit time to state @xmath13 for a slightly different random walk .",
    "however the first two moments are still of the same order and hence the queueing delay is the same , leading to the same delay scaling . as a result , even with this particular mobility restriction , the maximal throughput scaling and the corresponding delay scaling remain unchanged .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s :",
    "model_defs ] , we introduce the random mobile network model , some definitions and notation . in section  [ s : scheme_tput ] , we present a scheme using random relaying and show that it achieves constant throughput scaling . in section  [ s : delay ] , we show that the delay for this scheme is @xmath8 using results which are proved in section  [ s : rem_proofs ] .",
    "the proof of delay of @xmath8 consists of analyzing a queue at a relay node in two parts .",
    "the first part presented in section  [ s : delay ] identifies an i.i.d .",
    "component that is embedded in the arrival and service processes of the queue .",
    "the second part breaks the dependence between the arrival and departure processes by introducing a virtual bernoulli server .",
    "the queueing analysis that follows is carried out in section  [ s : rem_proofs ] .",
    "in this section , we present the network model , and the definitions of the performance metrics  throughput and delay .",
    "we begin by reminding the reader of the order notation : ( i ) @xmath15 means that there exists a constant @xmath16 and integer @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath20 means that @xmath21 .",
    "( iii ) @xmath22 means that @xmath23 , ( iv ) @xmath24 means that @xmath25 .",
    "( v ) @xmath26 means that @xmath27 .",
    "now let us recall what is meant by the uniform distribution of great circles on a sphere .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the surface of a sphere in @xmath4 with unit area .",
    "for @xmath29 , let @xmath30 be the diametrically opposite point of @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the great circle obtained by the intersection of @xmath28 with the plane passing through the center of @xmath28 and perpendicular to the line @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath31 be called the pole of @xmath32 .",
    "if the pole of a great circle is chosen according to a uniform distribution on @xmath28 then the great circle is said to have a uniform distribution .",
    "a natural random walk on a discrete torus of size @xmath34 is the process @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 is uniformly distributed over @xmath37 and @xmath38 is equally likely to be any element of @xmath39 .",
    "this differs from a simple random walk , where @xmath38 is equally likely to be any element of @xmath40 .",
    "since we are interested only in scaling results , we use the terms ( simple ) random walk and natural random walk interchangeably .",

    "time is slotted for transmission . associated with each node",
    "is a great circle of @xmath28 chosen independently according to a uniform distribution .",
    "the great circle of each node has @xmath41 equidistant lattice points numbered from @xmath42 to @xmath43 placed on it arbitrarily resulting in a one - dimensional discrete torus of size @xmath41 . each node moves according to a natural random walk on these lattice points on its great circle .",

    ", we assume that time - slots are of unit length so that when a successful transmission occurs a packet of size @xmath6 is communicated .    in the other commonly used model ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , known as the _ physical _ model ,",
    "a transmission is successful if the signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) is greater than some constant .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the _ protocol _ model is equivalent to the _ physical _ model when each transmitter uses the same power .",
    "the differences between this model and the model in @xcite are : ( i ) the relaxed protocol model is used instead of the physical model , and ( ii ) each node is assumed to move according to a natural random walk instead of just a stationary , ergodic motion with uniform stationary distribution on the great circle . however , this model has the same 1-d mobility restriction .",
    "further , the proofs clearly show that the assumption of mobility according to a natural random walk is not necessary for achieving constant throughput scaling and is used only for computing delay .",
    "a scheme @xmath55 for a random network is a sequence of communication policies , @xmath56 , where policy @xmath57 determines how communication occurs in a network of @xmath3 nodes .",
    "let @xmath58 be the number of bits of s - d pair @xmath59 , transferred in @xmath60 time - slots under policy @xmath57 .",
