    "flow around a circular cylinder is a classical topic in hydrodynamics that is of fundamental importance to many scientific fields with numerous applications @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the formation , at moderate reynolds numbers , of vortex eddies behind a circular cylinder , which then go unstable at higher reynolds numbers and evolve into a karman vortex street @xcite . since an analytic treatment of the problem in terms of the navier - stokes equation is difficult and the computational cost of direct numerical simulation very high , a particularly useful approach to study the basic features of vortex shedding from bluff bodies is to consider the dynamics of point vortices in an inviscid fluid .    a point - vortex model for the formation of two recirculating , symmetric eddies in the wake of a circular cylinder",
    "was first introduced by fppl @xcite .",
    "he obtained stationary solutions for a pair of vortices behind the cylinder in a uniform stream and found that the centers of the eddies observed in the experiments lie on the locus of such equilibria  now called the fppl curve .",
    "in addition , fppl found that these equlibria , although stable against perturbations that are symmetric with respect to the centerline , were unstable against nonsymmetric perturbations .",
    "this instability is believed to constitute the origin of the vortex shedding process that leads to the formation of the karman vortex street @xcite .",
    "it was later found out independently by several authors @xcite that fppl s stability analysis for symmetric perturbations was in error in that the stationary solution behind the cylinder is not exponentially but only marginally stable .",
    "physically , marginal stability implies , for instance , that if a splitter plate is placed behind the cylinder in the center plane of the wake to suppress vortex shedding @xcite , oscillating forces on the cylinder may still arise owing to the cyclic motion of the vortices around their equilibrium position @xcite .",
    "despite many contributions to the problem , it is fair to say that the nonlinear dynamics of the fppl system is not yet fully understood . in particular , a more complete picture of vortex - pair dynamics in the presence of symmetric perturbations is lacking , and several aspects of the nonlinear dynamics for nonsymmetric perturbations remain unclear . to address these two issues",
    "is the main motivation of the present paper .",
    "it should be emphasized at the outset that a better understanding of the dynamical structure underlying the fppl model is of interest not only because of its practical relevance for vortex shedding , but also in its own theoretical right from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the fppl model has inspired a number of studies on several related problems , such as the modeling of vortex wake behind slender bodies in terms of multiple pairs of point vortices @xcite , the hamiltonian structure of a circular cylinder interacting dynamically with point vortices @xcite , the control of vortex shedding @xcite , and the stability of symmetric and asymmetric vortex pairs over three - dimensional slender conical bodies @xcite .",
    "the related problem of desingularization of the fppl pair in terms of vortex patches of finite area was also studied @xcite . a recent review on vortex motion past solid bodies with additional references to the fppl model and related problems",

    "a phase portrait of the system is presented that fully characterizes the dynamics within this symmetric subspace . in particular , we point out that in addition to the two previously known sets of equilibira , namely , the fppl equilibrium and the equilibrium on the axis bisecting the cylinder perpendicularly to the uniform flow , the system possesses a hitherto unnoticed nilpotent saddle at infinity .",

    "the presence of the splitter plate tends to enforce symmetry of the flow with respect to the centerline , thus effectively reducing the appearance of antisymmetric disturbances behind the cylinder .",
    "the suppression of vortex shedding in this case is thus entirely consistent with the fact that the fppl equilibria of the vortex - point model is nonlinearly stable against symmetric perturbations and that vortex shedding is induced by unstable antisymmetric modes , as discussed above .",
