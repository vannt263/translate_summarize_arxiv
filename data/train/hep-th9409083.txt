    "superstring theories enjoy a number of interesting properties at first sight not shared by ordinary four - dimensional field theories . for a superstring theory , ( 1 )",
    "the basic entity is a string of size @xmath0 ) cm , with massless levels and excitation energies @xmath1 ) gev ; ( 2 ) loop corrections are ultraviolet finite and quantum gravity is well defined ; ( 3 ) the fundamental dynamical variables consist of the spacetime @xmath2 and the internal @xmath3 fields , all as functions of the worldsheet coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; ( 4 ) these variables propagate as independent free fields throughout the worldsheet , in a manner dependent on the topology but not on the geometry of the worldsheet ( reparametrization and conformal invariance ) ; ( 5 ) an external photon of momentum @xmath6 and wave function @xmath7 is inserted into the string through a vertex operator @xmath8\\exp[ip\\!\\cdot\\!x(\\sigma,\\tau)]$ ] , a form which is fixed by conformal invariance ; ( 6 ) conformal invariance leads to local ( veneziano ) duality of the scattering amplitude .",
    "a scattering process is described by one or very few string diagrams . in particular , for elastic scattering in the tree approximation , one string diagram ( the veneziano amplitude ) gives rise simultaneously to all the @xmath9-channel and the @xmath10-channel exchanges .    in constrast , in ordinary four - dimensional field theories ( qft ) , ( @xmath11 ) the basic entities are point particles ; ( @xmath12 ) loop corrections contain ultraviolet divergences and quantum gravity is non - renormalizable ; ( @xmath13 ) the fundamental dynamical variables are fields @xmath14 of the four - dimensional spacetime coordinates @xmath15 ; ( @xmath16 ) these fields propagate freely only between vertices , where interactions take place ; ( @xmath17 ) external photons are inserted into a feynman diagram through the photon operator @xmath18 $ ] ; ( @xmath19 ) there are many distinct feynman diagrams contributing to a scattering amplitude . for elastic scattering , @xmath9- and @xmath10-channel exchanges",
    "are given by different diagrams that must be added up together .",
    "in the ` low - energy ' limit when @xmath20 gev , a string of dimension @xmath21 cm is indistinguishable from a point , energy levels @xmath1 ) gev are too high to matter , so one would expect a string theory to reduce to an ordinary field theory of zero masses .",
    "in fact , explicit calculations have been carried out @xcite to show that a one - loop @xmath22-gluon amplitude in a string theory does reduce to corresponding results in field theory . in order to go beyond one loop or the @xmath22-gluon amplitude , where no simple string expression is available",
    ", it is better to proceed in a different way .",
    "since the string properties ( 3)(6 ) are quite different from the field - theory properties ( @xmath13)(@xmath19 ) , the equivalence of string and qft at low energies is not immediately obvious .",
    "the purpose of this series of papers is , among other things , to make these connections .",
    "there are two motivations for doing so . at a theoretical level",
    ", one can hope to gain new insights into gauge and gravitational theories from the string arrangement .",
    "for example , according to ( 3 ) and ( @xmath13 ) , spacetime and internal coordinates are treated on an equal footing in a string , but not so in qft .",
    "this asymmetry makes _",
    "local _ gauge transformations in qft awkward to deal with and practical calculations difficult to obtain",
    ". it would therefore be nice to be able to reformulate gauge and a gravitational theories in the symmetrical way of a string .",
    "conversely , one can hope that the successful multiloop treatment of qft , when written in a string - like manner , can give hints useful for multiloop string calculations . on the practical side , string - like organization of an field - theoretical amplitude",
    "allows the spinor helicity technique @xcite to be used on multiloop diagrams as easily as for tree diagrams @xcite ; it also enables color , spin , and momentum degrees of freedom to propagate independently , a separation that leads to efficient simplifications in actual calculations , so much so that amplitudes not computable by ordinary means can be obtained when organized in this novel way",
    ". examples of this includes the parke - taylor @xmath22-gluon amplitude @xcite , the factorization of identical - helicity photons produced in the @xmath23 annihilation into @xmath24-pairs @xcite , the computation of the one - loop @xmath22-photon amplitude of identical helicities @xcite , and the calculation of the @xmath22-gluon one - loop amplitudes @xcite .    in the low energy limit ,",
    "the variable @xmath4 along the string is frozen , so the dynamical fields in ( 3 ) are effectively functions of @xmath5 alone . to convert ( @xmath13 ) to ( 3 ) , one must be able to free the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath26 , to make them both independent functions of some _ proper time _ @xmath5 .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the schwinger - parameter representation for the field - theoretic scattering amplitude @xcite . in this representation ,",
    "every vertex @xmath27 in a feynman diagram is assigned a proper time @xmath28 , and each propagator @xmath29 is assigned a schwinger parameter @xmath30 . if @xmath31 is a line connecting vertices @xmath27 to @xmath32 , then @xmath33 .",
    "if we regard the feynman diagram as an electric circuit with resistances @xmath30 , then @xmath34 can be interpreted as ( the four - dimensional ) voltage at the vertex @xmath27 @xcite , thus freeing it to be an independent function of @xmath5 .",
    "spacetime flow is thus analogous to the current flow of an electric network , or equivalently the change of the electrical potential from point to point .",
    "color flows can be isolated by creating color - oriented vertices in feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "one color - oriented vertex may be related to another by twising , thus creating twisted feynman diagrams in much the same way like twisted open strings .",
    "the color subamplitudes so isolated with these color - flow factors are gauge invariant .    with massless fermions , chirality and helicities",
    "are conserved and this allows free and unobstructed spin flows .",
    "this is the essence of the spinor helicity technique which is applicable to photons and gluons as well , for a spin-1 particle can kinematically be regarded as the composite of two spin-@xmath35 particles .",
    "the schwinger proper - time formalism allows the spinor helicity technique to continue to work in loop diagrams @xcite ; otherwise the loop momentum would be there to break chirality conservation and to obstruct the free flow of spins .",
    "the spacetime , color , and spin flows thus obtained approximate the properties ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the string .",
    "moreover , using _",
    "differential circuit identities _",
    "@xcite , external electromagnetic vertices can be converted from ( @xmath17 ) to ( 5 ) .",
    "what remains to be considered in completing the string organization of field theory is then the property of _ local duality_. historically it was this unusual feature , first seen in the veneziano model @xcite , that marked the beginning of string theory . to what extent this interesting property",
    "is retained in field theory is therefore an interesting topic to study .",
    "we propose to make a first attempt in that direction in the present paper .",
    "duality for tree diagrams is considered in sec .  2 , where its exact meaning in field theory",
    "is also discussed .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we shall confine that section to a scalar theory where a scalar photon field @xmath36 is coupled to a charged scalar meson field @xmath37 via the lagrangian @xmath38 , but it turns out that once we solve the duality problem here it is solved in quantum electrodynamics as well . to prepare for discussions of qed and multiloop amplitudes , we review in sec .",
    "3 the schwinger - parameter representation for a field - theoretic scattering amplitude which provides the main tool for further discussions . duality for the multiloop scalar theory is discussed in sec .",
    "4 , and duality for qed is discussed in sec .",
    "the problem of qcd is much harder and we shall defer that to a future publication . finally , a concluding section appears in sec .",
    "duality in a string theory follows from its conformal invariance , which in the special case of a four - point amplitude can be used to fix the ( complex ) worldsheet positions of three of the external lines to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the fourth one to be @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "a particularly simple example is the veneziano amplitude @xcite in the mandelstam variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath42 this amplitude has poles when either @xmath9 or @xmath10 is a non - negative integer ( in units of @xmath43 gev]@xmath44 ) , but there are no simultaneous @xmath9- and @xmath10-channel poles .",
    "the amplitude can be expanded either as a sum of @xmath9-channel poles , represented purely by @xmath9-channel exchange feynman diagrams , _ or _ a sum of @xmath10-channel poles , represented purely by @xmath10-channel exchange diagrams .",
    "there is no need to _ add _ both the @xmath9-channel and the @xmath10-channel diagrams , as is necessary in ordinary quantum field theories .",
    "the @xmath10-channel amplitude is obviously equal to the @xmath9-channel amplitude , and both are equal to the single integral in ( 2.1 ) .",
    "duality_.    these results can be obtained directly from a pole expansion of the euler gamma functions , or from the integral representation for the beta function . in the latter case ,",
    "an expansion of the integrand about @xmath45 gives rise to the @xmath10-channel poles , and an expansion of the integrand about @xmath46 gives rise to the @xmath9-channel poles .",
    "at present energies , @xmath47 ( in units of @xmath48 ) , so only the massless poles contribute , giving rise to @xmath49 the @xmath10-channel pole comes from the divergence of the integral near @xmath45 when @xmath50 , and the @xmath9-channel pole comes from the divergence of the integral near @xmath46 when @xmath51 . in this form ,",
    "the amplitude does not _ appear _ to be ` dual ' anymore , because _ both _",
    "the @xmath9-channel and the @xmath10-channel poles are _ summed _ , instead of having a _ single _ expression like ( 2.1 ) , where only a sum of the @xmath9-channel _ or _ a sum of the @xmath10-channel poles are present .",
    "nevertheless , appearances are deceiving , because ( 2.2 ) follows mathematically from ( 2.1 ) , which is dual .",
    "in other words , the @xmath10-channel poles in ( 2.2 ) can be formally obtained by an infinite sum of massive @xmath9-channel poles , and ( 2.2 ) is as dual as it can be at low energies .",
    "it is instructive for later discussions to obtain ( 2.2 ) directly from the integral representation of ( 2.1 ) . for that purpose ,",
    "divide the integral in @xmath26 into two halves at the midpoint @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53 , the contribution of the integral comes mainly from @xmath45 , so we can put @xmath54 there .",
    "similarly the term @xmath55 can be ignored in the second integral .",
    "next , make the transformation @xmath56 in the first integral , so that @xmath57 $ ] there , and the transformation @xmath58 $ ] in the second integral , so that @xmath59 $ ] there . then for @xmath53 , the integral in ( 2.1 ) becomes @xmath60 which is the same as ( 2.2 ) .",
    "-2 cm    4.7 truein    -7.5 cm.1 cm    if one were to start directly from a massless scalar field theory @xmath61 ( where all fields are scalar and massless ) , then the ` compton scattering ' amplitude given by fig .  1 is identical to ( 2.2 ) . in that sense",
    "the field - theoretic amplitude is already dual , or as dual as it can be at the present energy range .",
    "one might still be unsatisfied with this remark about duality , and points out that the original dual amplitude in ( 2.1 ) is given by a _",
    "single _ integral , whereas in ( 2.3 ) this is given by the sum of _ two _ integrals . since ( 2.3 ) comes from ( 2.1 ) it must be able to write it as a single integral as well . all that we have to do is to define a function @xmath62 , then @xmath63 which is of course equivalent to the veneziano integral ( 2.1 ) at the present energy range .",
    "we shall refer to expressions of this type , where the sum of a _ number of diagrams _ is represented by a _",
    "single _ ( possibly multi - dimensional ) integral , as _",
    "dual expressions_. what allows the dual expression ( 2.4 ) to be written is not so much the explicit form of the integrands in ( 2.3 ) , but that the two integrals there have non - overlapping ranges in @xmath64 . given that , it is always possible to define a common integrand @xmath65 so that the two integrals can be combined into one .",
    "similar reasoning shows that dual expressions can be written for other processes in a scalar - photon theory . since we are imitating the low energy limit of strings",
    ", we may simplify writings by assuming all particles to be massless . in that case",
    ", the schwinger - parameter representation for a scalar propagator is @xmath66 and the variable @xmath67 is called a schwinger proper - time parameter . using this ,",
    "we can obtain ( 2.3 ) from ( 2.5 ) simply by letting @xmath68 , @xmath69 in the first term , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 in the second term .",
    "the fact that we can get the veneziano integral representation ( 2.3 ) from the schwinger representation confirms the claim that the schwinger - parameter representations are string - like .",
    "consider now a more complicated example , fig .  2 , in which charged particles scatter to produce @xmath72 ( scalar ) photons from one charged line and @xmath22 photons from another .",
    "we have drawn only one of the @xmath73 possible diagrams ; others are obtained from it by permuting the photon lines .",
    ".5 cm    4.7 truein    -10.5 cm    let us first establish some common notations .",
    "assign to each vertex of a feynman diagram a _ proper time _",
    "@xmath5 , as illustrated in fig .  2 . the schwinger proper - time parameters",
    "@xmath67 are then given by differences of the proper times .",
    "specifically , if @xmath31 is an internal line between vertices @xmath27 and @xmath32 , then @xmath74 .",
    "in this way , all the proper - time differences are determined but translational invariance prevents the origin of proper time to be fixed .",
    "let    @xmath75}&&\\equiv \\int_a^bd\\tau_1\\int_{\\tau_1}^bd\\tau_2 \\cdots\\int_{\\tau_{n-1}}^bd\\tau_n\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\int_a^b d\\tau_{[12(345)678]}&&\\equiv \\int_a^b d\\tau_{[12 ] } \\int_{\\tau_2}^bd\\tau_{[678 ] } \\left(\\prod_{i=3}^5\\int_{\\tau_2}^{\\tau _ 6}d\\tau_i\\right)\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle\\int d\\tau_{[12\\cdots n]}\\rangle&&\\equiv\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}{1\\over 2 t } \\int_{-t}^{t}d\\tau_{[12\\cdots n]}\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle\\int d\\tau_{[12(345)678]}\\rangle&&\\equiv\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}{1\\over 2 t } \\int_{-t}^t d\\tau_{[12(345)678]}\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\langle\\int d\\tau_{(12\\cdots n)}\\rangle&&\\equiv \\langle\\int d\\tau_{[(12\\cdots n)]}\\rangle \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in short , the integration variable enclosed between square brackets are ordered , and those between round brackets are unordered .",
    "we can now return to fig .",
    "its amplitude is @xmath76}\\rangle\\langle\\int d\\tau'_{[12\\cdots 0\\cdots n]}\\rangle\\exp(ip)\\ , \\ ] ] for some quadratic function @xmath77 of the external momenta obtained by using ( 2.5 ) on each propagator .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath77 does not concern us at the moment .",
    "the other diagrams are obtained by permuting the photon lines in fig .  2 , so their amplitudes are all given by something like ( 2.7 ) , but with the @xmath5 and @xmath78 integration regions permuted separately .",
    "the detailed form of the quadratic function @xmath77 may change from region to region but again we do not have to worry about it . since the integration regions of these different diagrams do not overlap ,",
    "it is possible to define a common @xmath79 equal to the individual @xmath77 s in their respective regions . in this way",
    ", all the @xmath73 diagrams can be summed up to get a single dual expression @xmath80 in which the integration regions are completely unordered .",
    "the reasoning can obviously be extended to any tree diagram in a scalar - photon theory . in every case",
    ", each charged line provides a platform for ordering the photon lines attached to it .",
    "different diagrams correspond to different permutations of these photon lines , so they correspond to different integration regions in the proper times .",
    "a sum into a single dual expression in which the proper time integration regions are unordered is clearly possible .",
    "furthermore , with minor modifications to be discussed in sec .",
    "4 , essentially the same consideration works for multiloop diagrams as well .",
    "there are three remarks to be made .",
    "first of all , it is interesting to note that the relation between a dual expression and a feynman diagram is very much like the relation between a feynman diagram and an old - fashioned diagram . recall that a feynman diagram with @xmath22 vertices is made up of a sum of @xmath81 old - fashioned diagrams , corresponding to the @xmath81 possible ( real ) time orderings of its vertices .",
    "similarly , a dual ` diagram ' consists of a sum of feynman diagrams , and they differ from one another by the _ proper - time _ orderings of their vertices .    secondly ,",
    "proper - time orderings in qed diagrams are very simple and natural , because there are the conserved charged lines along which the photon vertices can be proper - time ordered .",
    "in contrast , in a neutral scalar @xmath82 theory , or in a pure gluon qcd , all lines are equivalent and there are no obvious ways to proper - time order    -.5 cm    4.7 truein    -13 cm    .1 cm    the vertices , especially in multiloop diagrams .",
    "this is one of the difficulties one encounters in qcd .",
    "thirdly , there is the question of how useful these dual expressions are . that naturally depends on the details of the diagrams one tries to sum , and how simple the resulting integrand @xmath83 is .",
    "for example , consider the emission of scalar photons shown in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath6 and @xmath84 are massless but @xmath85 may be offshell . using ( 2.5 ) , and expressing the schwinger parameters @xmath86 as differences of the proper - time parameters @xmath87 , the exponent @xmath77 in the integrand @xmath83 becomes    @xmath88    by using momentum conservation , this can also be written in a more symmetric form : latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is given by the product of the non - type - a vertices and terms generated from their mutual contractions .",
    "moreover , it is true that @xcite @xmath165 for a type - a vertex , so it does not matter whether @xmath130 in ( 3.14 ) is put before or after the @xmath152 s .",
    "another useful relation to know is @xmath166 provided @xmath167 .",
    "this relation can be used to show how the string - like vertex changes under a guage transformation , when @xmath168 is replaced by @xmath169 . in that case , remembering that @xmath170 , ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.16 ) give @xmath171",
    "in the scalar - photon theory with interaction @xmath172 , the most general amplitude is given by ( 3.2 ) , with @xmath173 and @xmath77 given by ( 3.3 ) and ( 3.7 ) .",
    "the schwinger parameters @xmath86 will be expressed as differences of the proper - time parameters @xmath174 , and the proper times will again be ordered along the charged lines as in the tree cases .",
    "the only new problem here is where to begin the ordering in the case of a charged - scalar loop .",
    "-0 cm    3.0 truein    -5 cm    since the origin of the proper time is never determined by the @xmath86 s , it can be chosen arbitrarily , say at the position marked ` 0 ' in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "we must now insert into ( 3.2 ) a factor @xmath175 for every charged loop , where the sum is taken over all the @xmath86 s in the loop .",
    "so for fig .  5 ,",
    "the @xmath86-integrations can be replaced by @xmath176}\\equiv \\langle\\int d \\tau _ { [ 12\\cdots n]}\\rangle\\ , \\ ] ]    -0 cm    4.7 truein    -9.5 cm    .1 cm    where @xmath177 for @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "strictly speaking , there is an inconsistency in the definition of @xmath180}\\rangle$ ] between ( 4.2 ) and ( 2.6 ) , but in practice ( 4.2 ) is always used for closed charged loops and ( 2.6 ) is always used for open charged lines .",
    "one can now obtain dual amplitudes by summing over all photon permutations in exactly the same way as before .",
    "for example , for fig .  5 and its permuted diagrams , the sum is proportional to @xmath181 for fig .  6 and its permuted diagrams , the sum is proportional to @xmath182    as in tree amplitudes , how useful such dual expressions are depends on the complexity of @xmath77 and @xmath130 in each case . in the eikonal approximation ( 2.11)(2.16 ) ,",
    "the integrals can be carried out because @xmath98 is common for all integration regions _ and _ because it has a simple dependence on the proper times .",
    "now the first condition is not hard to meet , if the diagrams to be summed have a high degree of symmetry .",
    "for example , for the well - studied case of fig .",
    "5 @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 ) show that @xmath183 , and @xmath184 which has a symmetric form in the sense that it has the same functional form in all integration regions . however , one is still unable to evaluate the integral ( 4.3 ) analytically because of its relatively complicated @xmath5-dependences .",
    "for the reason discussed at the end of sec .  2 ,",
    "@xmath77 can be made symmetric or partially symmetric in many cases .",
    "one way of seeing this is the following . if we modify fig .  3 by adding on a charged - scalar propagator at each end , then analogous to ( 2.10 ) one can produce a form of @xmath77 which is completely symmetrical in all the photon lines .",
    "we have already seen that the @xmath77 in fig .",
    "5 is completely symmetrical in all its photon lines as well .",
    "now every feynman diagram can be built up from a number of open charged lines with its attached photons , and a number of one - charged - loop diagrams with its attached photons , by joining together pairs of photon lines .",
    "mathematically , one obtains the resulting amplitudes by multiplying these @xmath77 s of the components , together with the propagators of the joined photon lines in the form of ( 2.5 ) , then carries out the momentum integrations of the joined photon lines .",
    "since the dependences on these joined momenta are gaussian , such integrations can be carried out , and one again obtains a result of the form ( 3.2 ) , with @xmath185 , and with @xmath77 of ( 3.2 ) a function of the component @xmath77 s .",
    "since the component @xmath77 s are symmetric in all the photon lines , they will still be symmetric in the remaining , unjoined , external photon lines , so in this way one can obtain a symmetric form for the final @xmath77 .",
    "this mechanism for obtaining a symmetric form has been discussed recently @xcite in a slightly different language .",
    "however , the symmetric form obtained this way is usually much more complicated than those obtained directly from ( 3.3 ) , ( 3.6 ) , and ( 3.7 ) .",
    "it is so complicated that it is unlikely to be integrated analytically , nor will it lead to simpler numerical evaluations in most cases . see the end of sec .  2 for more discussions along these lines .",
    "though one can generally produce other simpler symmetric forms , they are still not simple enough for the integrations to be carried out explicitly",
    ". for these reasons there seems to be no particular advantage of having a symmetric form and we will not do so most of the time .",
    "the most important ingredient for obtaining a dual expression is the presence of a conserved charged line along which to order the interaction vertices .",
    "this is independent of the spin of the particles involved , hence one can obtain dual amplitudes in qed just as easily as those in the scalar - photon theory .",
    "the factor @xmath186 in ( 3.2 ) is no longer 1 for qed . for scalar qed , for example",
    ", it is made up of the product of the vertex factors @xmath187 and @xmath188 and their contractions .",
    "( 3.11 ) and the paragraph above it .",
    "this however makes no difference to the construction of the dual amplitude .",
    "another minor complication is the presence of the seagull vertex @xmath188 .",
    "this simply adds a dirac-@xmath189 function contribution to the integrand .",
    "for example , in the compton scattering diagram fig .  7 , all that we have to do to accommodate the seagull vertex in fig .",
    "7(c ) is to define the integrand of the dual amplitude to be @xmath190 where @xmath191 are the respectively factors for the three diagrams figs .",
    "7(a ) , 7(b ) , and 7(c ) .",
    "-2.5 cm    4.7 truein    -5.5 cm    .1 cm    what distinguishes the dual expressions of qed from the scalar theory is gauge invariance , in that the diagrams in qed to be summed are connected by gauge invariance .",
    "this means that the gauge - dependent parts of each diagram should no longer be there in the dual sum .",
    "how the dual expression can be mathematically manipulated to achieve this purpose unfortunately depends on the details . at this moment",
    "two general techniques are available to aid us .",
    "one is the spinor helicity technique @xcite , where the reference momenta of the photons can be chosen appropriately to reduce the amount of gauge - dependent contributions .",
    "the other is the integration - by - parts technique @xcite used in connection with the string - like operators appearing in ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.14 ) .",
    "we mentioned previously that the relation between a dual amplitude and a feynman amplitude is analogous to the relation between a feynman amplitude and an old - fashioned amplitude . in each case",
    "the former is not time - ordered , and the latter is ; the only difference being that it is proper - time ordering for the first pair and real - time ordering for the second . now with gauge theories , there is another parallel between these two cases : an old - fashioned diagram is not relativistically invariant but a feynman diagram is .",
    "similarly , a feynman diagram is not gauge invariant but a dual diagram is .",
    "let us consider two simple examples to illustrate these points .",
    "first , consider the compton amplitude fig .  7 in scalar qed .",
    "a propagator is added to each external charged line so that the vertices 1 and 3 in figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) are of type - a , to enable the string - like vertex ( 3.11 ) to be used . without the seagull term fig .",
    "7(c ) , the amplitude is not gauge invariant , so it definitely contains a non - trivial gauge - dependent part . as we shall see below",
    ", one can actually manipulate the dual expression so that the seagull vertex seems to disappear , and the gauge - dependent parts from these three diagrams are no longer present .",
    "the expression @xmath77 for diagrams ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , and ( c ) are respectively @xmath192 using ( 3.14 ) , the vertex factors in both cases become @xmath193\\left[\\epsilon ( p_3)\\!\\cdot\\!d_3\\right ] \\equiv s\\ .\\ ] ] in their respective regions , one can replace @xmath194 and @xmath195 by @xmath196 however , since @xmath174-differentiations are involved in @xmath197 of ( 5.3 ) , @xmath198 and @xmath199 are not identical to @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "it can be checked by explict calculation that the former already contains the seagull vertex in fig .",
    "hence the dual expression for fig .  7 is @xmath202\\left [ \\epsilon(p_3)\\!\\cdot\\!d_3 \\right]\\exp(ip')\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath203 the fact that the seagull vertex _ seems _ to have disappeared suggests that we have eliminated the gauge - dependent contributions altogether . to see that explicitly , use ( 3.17 ) . then under a gauge transformation , @xmath204 ( @xmath205 )",
    "is changed into something proportional to @xmath206 .",
    "the integral over @xmath207 in ( 5.5 ) can then be carried out to yield the boundary contributions at @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and hence the ward - takahashi identity .",
