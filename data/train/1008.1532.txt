    "the theoretical description of ultrafast processes in modern electronic devices is an important problem of contemporary condensed matter physics.@xcite the entangled role of the fluctuation and correlation effects , especially in low dimensions , makes such an examination a challenge . in particular , it is not easy to reproduce correct excitonic and biexcitonic features in the optical absorption spectra of materials . besides fundamental interest such as in 4-wave",
    "mixing,@xcite excitonic and biexcitonic effects have a variety of practical applications , such as optoelectronic devices,@xcite entangled photon sources,@xcite and quantum computing.@xcite    the standard approaches , based on the semiconductor bloch equations ( sbes ) @xcite and nonequilibrium green s function techniques,@xcite can not be easily applied to study higher - order correlation effects in strongly nonequilibrium situation , because this requires many - particle correlation functions that depend on many time arguments.@xcite approaching these problems with time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite looks promising due to its formal simplicity and the fact that it in principle includes correlation effects exactly ; however , this usually requires going beyond the standard lda - gga approximations.@xcite excitonic effects have been studied with tddft in several ways , including the time - dependent optimized effective potential approach @xcite and the combination with the bethe - salpeter method.@xcite unfortunately , these approaches also become very tedious in the strongly nonequilibrium case .",
    "recently , we proposed an alternative approach for ultrafast excitonic effects based on the single - particle density matrix and a tddft version of the sbes.@xcite we showed that the effective electron - hole attraction is defined by matrix elements of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) kernel @xmath0 with respect to the valence and conduction band kohn - sham single - particle wave functions .",
    "experimentally observed lowest exciton binding energies can be reproduced in a simple way using the local and long - range xc kernels @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be viewed as adjustable parameters .",
    "the alda @xmath0 leads to a too weak electron - hole attraction to produce bound excitons .    in the case of biexcitons , which are correlated double electronic excitations ,",
    "the problem is much more complicated .",
    "one reason is that multiple excitations in tddft require nonadiabatic xc functionals , and so far there are no simple approximations available .",
    "another reason is that at first sight it is not clear how to represent biexcitonic wave functions in kohn - sham tddft . in this paper , we formulate and test an alternative tddmft approach for biexcitons based on the natural orbital ( no ) representation for the stationary electron eigenfunctions,@xcite where the multiparticle excited states are naturally related to the higher - order density matrix elements .",
    "the standard tddft single - particle hamiltonian is @xmath5({\\bf r},t ) + v_{\\rm xc}[n]({\\bf r},t ) \\:.\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the static potential of the nuclei plus the time - dependent external perturbing potential .",
    "we consider a homogeneous external electric field in dipole approximation , @xmath7 , which implies that the characteristic field frequency is much larger than the level spacing .",
    "@xcite @xmath8 is the hartree potential , and @xmath9 is the time - dependent xc potential , which are both functionals of the time - dependent single - particle density @xmath10 .",
    "the hartree potential is not very important for the description of excitions , but the xc potential is crucial , since it accounts for the effective electron - hole interaction.@xcite    in general , @xmath11({\\bf r},t)$ ] has a memory , i.e. , it depends on densities at previous times @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting xc kernel @xmath0 , defined as @xmath13 therefore has in general a frequency dependence . an explicitly frequency - dependent @xmath0 is required for describing double excitations with linear - response tddft.@xcite however , to date there are only few approximations for @xmath0 available , and none of them is particularly suited for the biexcitonic properties in solids we have in mind . for this reason , we choose a slightly different approach .    to describe the properties of doubly - excited @xmath14-electron systems",
    ", one can consider the one- and two - electron density matrices , defined as  @xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the many - body wave function and @xmath18 denotes the space coordinate and spin index .",
    "@xmath19 describes the single - particle properties of the system , such as the charge density @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , all ground - state quantities , including @xmath21 , can in principle be obtained from @xmath22 , since there is one - to - one correspondence between @xmath22 and the ground state many - body wave function @xmath23 ( the dmft generalization of the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite ) .",
    "let us now restrict the discussion to two - electron systems and derive equations of motion for the density matrices .",

    ", excitons can still be described , since the frequency - dependence of @xmath0 is not essential for the electron - hole interaction .",
    "however , biexcitons ( which are correlated two - particle excitations ) can not be captured in the adiabatic approximation . to make up for this ,",
    "we introduce , in a somewhat ad - hoc manner , an effective two - particle interaction @xmath27({\\bf r}_{1},{\\bf r}_{2},t)$ ] which we define as a functional of the two - particle density @xmath28 . in this way ,",

    "we will soon see that in the two - band approximation the excitonic wave function is proportional to @xmath37 , and the biexcitonic one to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 stand for the conduction and valence bands , and @xmath41 is the corresponding electron and hole momentum . from now on ,",
    "we shall use superscripts to denote band indices .",

    "equation ( [ 6 ] ) is nonlinear , since the matrix elements , which depend on the electron density , are functions of @xmath31 . from the definitions of @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 one then obtains the following equations for the one- and two - particle matrix elements : @xmath47 @xmath48 an important feature of eqns .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) is the fact that they are closed , i.e. one does not need to truncate an infinite hierarchy of equations for higher - order density - matrix elements .",
    "however , keep in mind that this property is only valid for two - level ( two - band ) systems . in the single electron ( @xmath49 )",
    "linearized diagonal approximation for two bands , one obtains the tddft - wannier equation for the exciton eigenenergies and eigenfunctions from eq.(7):@xcite @xmath50 \\gamma_{n{\\bf k}',{\\bf q}}^{cv } \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the electron momentum , @xmath52 is the sum of the electron and hole momenta ( the exciton momentum ) and @xmath53 are the matrix elements for the effective electron - hole attraction .",
    "the possibility to obtain a biexcitonic state with the tddmft formalism can be already shown for a two - level model with the energy levels @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the homo - lumo gap @xmath56 . from eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) in the lowest ( second ) order approximation ( by keeping only those matrix elements which contain no more than two indices `` 2 '' ) , one obtains the following system of equations after carrying out a fourier transformation into the frequency domain : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 all matrix elements are evaluated at the initial ( non - perturbed ) densities , and we use the shorthand notation 1 for @xmath63 , 2 for @xmath64 , etc",
    ". the solutions of the system of equations ( [ 10 ] ) can be easily found : @xmath65    from the general solution , one can discuss several limiting cases . in particular , for no correlations ( @xmath66 ) one gets a trivial solution with one and two free excited electrons : @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in the absence of a density - dependent two - electron potential ( @xmath69({\\bf r}_{1},{\\bf r}_{1})=g^{2}=0 $ ] ) , one finds an excitonic state with energy @xmath70 .",
    "however , the second root @xmath71 can not be lower than @xmath72 , i.e. the linear adiabatic approximation does not produce a biexciton , as expected . on the other hand , for nonzero @xmath69({\\bf r}_{1},{\\bf r}_{1})$ ] ,",
    "when @xmath73 and @xmath74 , one can obtain a biexcitonic level with binding energy @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a biexcitonic state in pure tddft [ with no @xmath69({\\bf r}_{1},{\\bf r}_{1})$ ] ] in the adiabatic approximation , one needs to go to the nonlinear regime and consider the next order terms ( @xmath76 ) in the equations . to show the possibility of a biexcitonic solution one assumes that the initial state includes a long - living exciton , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the averaged `` excitonic function '' ( see also ref . , where a possibility to obtain double excitations in the adiabatic tddft was considered )",
    ". then , the second ( biexcitonic ) equation ( [ 10 ] ) acquires an additional term ( at @xmath79 ) , which results in the eigenenergy @xmath80 that corresponds to the biexcitonic solution in the case @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "the generalization to the many - electron case is straightforward .",
    "the equation for the biexciton energies ( with zero center - of - mass momentum ) in the two - band approximation has the following form : @xmath86\\gamma_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q},{\\bf k}',{\\bf k},{\\bf k}'+{\\bf q}}^{ccvv } - \\sum_{{\\bf k}'}g_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q},{\\bf k}';{\\bar { \\bf k}}+{\\bar { \\bf q}},{\\bar { \\bf k}}',{\\bar { \\bf k}},{\\bar { \\bf k}}'+{\\bar { \\bf q } } } \\gamma_{{\\bar { \\bf k}}+{\\bar { \\bf q}},{\\bar { \\bf k}}',{\\bar { \\bf k}},{\\bar { \\bf k}}'+{\\bar { \\bf q}}}^{ccvv } \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are two - particle density kernels .",
