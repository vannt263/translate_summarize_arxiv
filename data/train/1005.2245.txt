    "in the recent years there is a revived interest in the properties of ferromagnetic chromium chalcogenide spinels mcr@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = divalent element , x = s , se , te ) .",
    "these materils are prospective candidates for spin - based electronic ( spintronic ) applications as the strong interaction between the electronic and spin subsystems results in drastic changes of the electronic transport and optical properties near the curie temperature , t@xmath4.@xcite cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath5  k ) attracts particular attention as it is ferromagnetic at room temperature and some theoretical models predict that with suitable doping it may become half - metallic - being an excellent metal for one spin channel and excellent insulator for the other spin channel.@xcite while the structural , magnetic and electric properties of cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 have been subject of numerous studies , there are to our knowledge no reports on its lattice dynamics and possible effects of spin - phonon coupling . in this work we present and analyze the experimental raman spectra of cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 single crystals in close comparison with predictions of lattice dynamics calculations within a shell modes .",
    "the raman mode intensities exhibit resonant behavior for excitation photon energies between 1.58 and 2.71  ev , but no significant anomalies in phonon parameters are observed near the magnetic transition at @xmath6 .",
    "single crystals of cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 were grown using the chemical vapor transport ( cvt ) technique following a procedure similar to that described in ref .. briefly , polycrystalline cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 was used as the precursor with iodine gas as transport agent placed in a sealed quartz tube ( length : 15  cm ; diameter : 1.5  cm ) .",
    "the source temperature was maintained at 870@xmath7c while the crystal growth at the other end of the tube occurred at 770@xmath7c .",
    "the reaction was carried out for a period of 80  hours , after which the tube was cooled down and broken to collect the single platelet - like crystals with ( 111 ) surfaces ( see fig.1 ) deposited in the cooler zone .",
    "the raman spectra were measured with five laser lines ( 784 , 633 , 515 , 488 , and 458  nm ) using a t64000 spectrometer equipped with microscope and heating stage . in temperature - dependent studies the laser power at the probe spot ( 3 - 4  @xmath8 m diameter )",
    "was kept below 0.1  mw to assure negligible local laser heating .",
    "se@xmath1 surface topography .",
    "the laser focus spot is also seen.,width=188 ]",
    "the structure of mcr@xmath0x@xmath1 is described by the @xmath9 ( no .",
    "227 ) space group .",
    "the primitive cell contains 14 atoms and the reduction of the 42-dimensional representation @xmath10 at @xmath11 into irreducible representations gives @xcite : @xmath12 the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the three @xmath15 modes are raman - active , four of the five @xmath16 modes are ir - active and one is an acoustic mode .",
    "the @xmath17 , 2@xmath18 , 2@xmath19 , and 2@xmath20 modes are silent .",
    "simple calculations for backward scattering from a ( 111 ) surface ( table  i ) show that the scattered intensity should not depend on the rotation of the crystal surface around the propagation direction of the incident light , but only on the angle @xmath21 between the incident @xmath22 and scattered @xmath23 polarizations .    .polarization selection rules for backward scattering from a ( 111 ) surface . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the raman scattering cross - section @xmath24 in non - transparent materials is related to the combined electronic density of states . as a rule",
    "@xmath24 is proportional to the @xmath25 and has maxima near interband gaps .",
    "the experimentally observed dependence of the raman intensity on the excitation photon energy @xmath26 , however , is additionally modified by the spectral properties of the raman setup and the absorption and reflection losses , which occur for the incident and scattered light . the detail analysis of resonant raman scattering in closely related cdcr@xmath0se@xmath1 has shown that @xmath24 has a maximum near 2  ev.@xcite it has also been shown in that study that the intensity of the @xmath15 raman lines , if normalized to the @xmath14 intensity , strongly increases with photon energy between 1.5 and 2.8  ev thus demonstrating the dependence of scattering cross section on the phonon symmetry . as it follows from fig.3 , similar enhancement of the relative intensity of the @xmath15 modes is observed for cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "fig.7 shows in more detail the variation with @xmath27 of the normalized intensity for the 170  @xmath28 , 220  @xmath28 , and 227  @xmath29 modes .    for tentative explanation of the resonant enhancement of the @xmath15 intensity",
    "let us consider the _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations @xcite for cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "following these calculation the electronic density of states ( dos ) above the fermi level is dominated by the cr @xmath30 states , while those below the fermi level by the cu @xmath30 and the se @xmath31 states .",
    "an optical transition between cu and cr @xmath30 bands can be disregarded due to the large spatial separation between the cu and cr ions .",
    "therefore , a possible candidate for an optical transition could be an electron transfer between the se @xmath31 and cr @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "transition energies of 3.2  ev between se @xmath32 and cr @xmath33 states , and 2.84  ev between se @xmath34 and cr @xmath35 states could be expected on the basis of calculated centers of gravity of the corresponding bands @xcite .",
    "the latter value is close the experimentally observed maximum at 2.75  ev of the optical conductivity of cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 reported by ongushi et al.@xcite    , 220  @xmath28 , and 227  @xmath29 modes with excitation photon energy.,width=188 ]    the lattice dynamics calculation can help us understand why a@xmath36 and @xmath15 modes exhibit stronger coupling to se  @xmath31 - cr  @xmath30 transitions than the @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling of a raman - active phonon to an optical transition is mainly due to two mechanisms : ( i ) modulation of the dipolar transition moment , and ( ii ) modulation of the transition energy by the atomic displacements . as a rule the modulation of the transition energy has stronger resonant behavior and gives a dominant contribution to the raman scattering intensity under resonant conditions .",
    "we will consider the optical @xmath37 transitions in a simplified tight - binding picture assuming that the transition energy is roughly equal to the difference between the on - site energies of the se @xmath31 and cr @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "since the on - site energy is a scalar quantity , it transforms according to the permutational representation of the given atomic position .",
    "the decomposition of the permutational representations for the 16d ( cr ) and 32e ( se ) positions gives : @xmath38 therefore , among raman - active modes only a@xmath36 and f@xmath39 modulate the se and cr orbital energies and respectively the energy of the @xmath37 transitions .",
    "this fact can be understood by inspecting the atomic displacement patterns in fig .",
    "6 . in the a@xmath36 and f@xmath39 modes",
    "the se displacements have identical radial components relative to the cr atom and , therefore , give identical variations of the madelung potential at the cr site . for the @xmath14 mode",
    ", however , the radial components of the se displacements are of alternating signs leading to cancelation of the madelung potential variations at the cr site . by following our lattice dynamics calculations",
    "it is easy to note that the resonant enhancement of the f@xmath39 modes increases with the increase of the radial character of the vibration .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath13 mode shows an enhanced normalized intensity also with 784  nm(1.58  ev ) excitation , which is in the energy range of the cr @xmath40 transitions.@xcite",
    "the raman spectra of the ferromagnetic spinel cucr@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath5  k ) was studied experimentally and analyzed theoretically by calculation of lattice dynamics . the normalized raman scattering intensity for a@xmath36 and f@xmath39 exhibits resonant behavior similar to that known for the isostructural cdcr@xmath0se@xmath1 , but no significant phonon anomalies are observed near @xmath6 .",
