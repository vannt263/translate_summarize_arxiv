    "covering theorems are known to be among some of the fundamental tools of measure theory .",
    "they reflect the geometry of the space and are commonly used to establish connections between local and global behavior of measures .",
    "covering theorems and their applications have been studied for example in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are several types of covering results , all with the same purpose : from an arbitrary cover of a set in a metric space , one extracts a subcover as disjointed as possible .",
    "we will consider more specifically here the so - called besicovitch covering property ( bcp ) which originates from the work of besicovitch ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in connection with the theory of differentiation of measures .",
    "see subsection  [ subsection : bcp ] for a more detailed presentation of the besicovitch covering property and its applications .",
    "the geometric setting in which we are interested is the setting of carnot groups equipped with so - called homogeneous distances , and more specifically here the heseinberg groups @xmath0 . our main result in this paper , theorem  [ thm : main ] , is the fact that bcp holds for the homogeneous distances on @xmath0 whose unit ball centered at the origin coincides with an euclidean ball centered at the origin .",
    "these distances are bi - lipschitz equivalent to any other homogeneous distance on @xmath0 and in particular to the commonly used cygan - kornyi ( also usually called kornyi or gauge ) and carnot - carathodory distances .",
    "recall that two distances @xmath1 and @xmath2 are said to be bi - lipschitz equivalent if there exists @xmath3 such that @xmath4 .",
    "cygan - kornyi and carnot - carathodory distances are known not to satisfy bcp ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we indeed stress that the validity of bcp depends strongly on the distance the space is endowed with , and more specifically on the geometry of its balls . to put some more evidence on this fact and to put our result in perspective",
    ", we also prove in the present paper two criteria that imply the non - validity of bcp .",
    "they give two large families of homogeneous distances on @xmath0 that do not satisfy bcp and show that in some sense our example for which bcp holds is sharp .",
    "see section  [ section : distancesw / obcp ] , theorem  [ thm : nobcpingoingcorners ] and theorem  [ thm : nobcpoutgoingcorners ] .    as a matter of fact",
    ", our first criterion applies to the cygan - kornyi and to the carnot - carathodory distance , thus giving also new geometric proofs of the failure of bcp for these distances .",
    "it also applies to the so - called box - distance ( the terminology might not be standard although this distance is a standard homogeneous distance on @xmath0 , see ) thus proving the non - validity of bcp for this latter homogeneous distance as well .",
    "going back to the distances considered in the present paper and for which we prove that bcp holds , hebisch and sikora showed in @xcite that in any carnot group , there are homogeneous distances whose unit ball centered at the origin coincides with an euclidean ball centered at the origin with a small enough radius . in the specific case of the heisenberg groups , these distances are related to the cygan - kornyi distance .",
    "they can indeed be expressed in terms of the quadratic mean of the cygan - kornyi distance ( at least for some specific value of the radius of the euclidean ball which coincides with the unit ball centered at the origin ) together with the pseudo - distance on @xmath0 given by the euclidean distance between horizontal components .",
    "these distances have been previously considered in the literature .",
    "lee and naor proved in @xcite that these metrics are of negative type on @xmath0 .",
    "recall that a metric space @xmath5 is said to be of negative type if @xmath6 is isometric to a subset of a hilbert space .",
    "combined with the work of cheeger and kleiner @xcite about weak notion of differentiability for maps from @xmath0 into @xmath7 , which leads in particular to the fact that @xmath0 equipped with a homogeneous distance does not admit a bi - lipschitz embedding into @xmath7 , this provides a counterexample to the goemans - linial conjecture in theoretical computer science , which was the motivation for these papers .",
    "let us remark that the cygan - kornyi distance is not of negative type on @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to subsection  [ subsection : heisenberg ] for the precise definition of our distances and their connection with the cygan - kornyi distance and the distances of negative type considered in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a metric space .",
    "when speaking of a ball @xmath8 in @xmath9 , it will be understood in this paper that @xmath8 is a closed ball and that it comes with a fixed center and radius ( although these in general are not uniquely determined by @xmath8 as a set ) .",
    "thus @xmath10 for some @xmath11 and some @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "one says that the besicovitch covering property ( bcp ) holds for the distance @xmath1 on @xmath9 if there exists an integer @xmath14 with the following property .",
    "let @xmath15 be a bounded subset of @xmath5 and let @xmath16 be a family of balls in @xmath5 such that each point of @xmath15 is the center of some ball of @xmath16 .",
    "then there is a subfamily @xmath17 whose balls cover @xmath15 and such that every point in @xmath9 belongs to at most @xmath18 balls of @xmath19 , that is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the characteristic function of a set @xmath15 .",
    "when equipped with a homogeneous distance , the heisenberg groups turn out to be doubling metric spaces . recall that this means that there exists an integer @xmath22 such that each ball with radius @xmath12 can be covered with less than @xmath23 balls with radius @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath5 is a doubling metric space , bcp turns out to be equivalent to a covering property , strictly weaker in general , that we call the weak besicovitch covering property ( w - bcp ) ( the terminology might not be standard ) and with which we shall work in this paper .",
    "first , let us fix some more terminology with the following definition .",
    "[ besicovitch balls ] we say that a family @xmath16 of balls in @xmath5 is a _ family of besicovitch balls _ if @xmath25 is a finite family of balls such that @xmath26 for all @xmath8 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and for which @xmath29",
    ".    one says that the weak besicovitch covering property ( w - bcp ) holds for the distance @xmath1 on @xmath9 if there exists an integer @xmath14 such that @xmath30 for every family @xmath16 of besicovitch balls in @xmath5 .",
    "the validity of bcp implies the validity of w - bcp .",
    "we stress that there exists metric spaces for which w - bcp holds although bcp is not satisfied .",
    "however , when the metric is doubling , both covering properties turn out to be equivalent as stated in characterization  [ characterization : equivalentbcp ] below .",
    "this characterization can be proved following the arguments of the proof of theorem 2.7 in @xcite .",
    "[ characterization : equivalentbcp ] let @xmath5 be a doubling metric space . then bcp holds for the distance @xmath1 on @xmath9 if and only if w - bcp holds for the distance @xmath1 on @xmath9 .    as already said , covering theorems and especially the besicovitch covering property and the weak besicovitch covering property play an important role in many situations in measure theory , regularity and differentiation of measures , as well as in many problems in harmonic analysis .",
    "this is particularly well illustrated by the connection between w - bcp and the so - called differentiation theorem .",
    "the validity of bcp in the euclidean space is due to besicovitch and was a key tool in his proof of the fact that the differentiation theorem holds for each locally finite borel measure on @xmath31 ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , as emphasized in theorem  [ thm : diff ] , the validity of w - bcp turns actually out to be equivalent to the validity of the differentiation theorem for each locally finite borel measure as shown in @xcite .",
    "* preiss ) [ thm : diff ] let @xmath5 be a complete separable metric space .",
    "then the differentiation theorem holds for each locally finite borel measure @xmath32 on @xmath5 , that is , @xmath33 for @xmath32-almost every @xmath11 and for each @xmath34 if and only if @xmath35 where , for each @xmath36 , w - bcp holds for family of balls centered on @xmath37 with radii less than @xmath38 for some @xmath39 .",
    "as already stressed , the fact that bcp holds in a metric space depends strongly on the distance with which the space is endowed . on the one hand , with very mild assumptions on the metric space ( namely , as soon as there exists an accumulation point ) , one can indeed always construct bi - lipschitz equivalent distances as close as we want from the original distance and for which bcp is not satisfied , as shown in the following result .",
    "[ thm : destroybcp ] let @xmath5 be a metric space .",
    "assume that there exists an accumulation point in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath40 .",
    "then there exists a distance @xmath2 on @xmath9 such that @xmath41 and for which w - bcp , and hence bcp , do not hold .",
    "a slightly different version of this result is stated in theorem 3 of @xcite . for sake of completeness",
    ", we give in section  [ section : destroybcp ] a construction of such a distance as stated in theorem  [ thm : destroybcp ] .    on the other hand , the question whether a metric space can be remetrized so that bcp holds is in general significantly more delicate .",
    "as already explained , the main result of the present paper , theorem  [ thm : main ] , is a positive answer to this question for the heisenberg groups equipped with ad - hoc homogeneous distances , namely those whose unit ball at the origin coincides with an euclidean ball with a small enough radius .      as a set we identify the heisenberg group @xmath0 with @xmath42 and we equip it as a topological space with the euclidean topology .",
    "we choose the following convention for the group law @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 belong to @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 belong to @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes the usual scalar product in @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to a choice of exponential and homogeneous coordinates .",
    "the one parameter family of dilations on @xmath0 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 these dilations are group automorphisms .",
    "[ def : homogeneousdistance ] a distance @xmath1 on @xmath0 is said to be _ homogeneous _ if the following properties are satisfied .",
    "first , it induces the euclidean topology on @xmath0 .",
    "second , it is left invariant , that is , @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . and third , it is one - homogeneous with respect to the dilations , that is , @xmath59 for all @xmath56 , @xmath60 and all @xmath61 .",
    "it turns out that homogeneous distances on @xmath0 do exist in abundance and make it a doubling metric space .",
    "it is also well known that any two homogeneous distances are bi - lipschitz equivalent .",
    "see for example @xcite for more details about the heisenberg groups and more generally carnot groups .",
    "the ( family of ) homogeneous distance(s ) we consider in this paper can be defined in the following way . for @xmath62 , we denote by @xmath63 the euclidean ball in @xmath64 centered at the origin with radius @xmath65 , that is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the euclidean norm in @xmath68 and we set @xmath69    hebisch and sikora proved in @xcite that if @xmath62 is small enough , then @xmath70 actually defines a distance on @xmath0 .",
    "more generally this holds true in any carnot group starting from the set @xmath63 given by the euclidean ball centered at the origin with radius @xmath62 small enough , where one identifies in the usual way the group with some @xmath71 where @xmath72 is its topological dimension .",
    "it then follows from the very definition that @xmath70 turns out to be the homogeneous distance on @xmath0 for which the unit ball centered at the origin coincides with the euclidean ball with radius @xmath65 centered at the origin .",
    "the geometric description of arbitrary balls that can then be deduced from the unit ball centered at the origin via dilations and left - translations is actually of crucial importance for understanding the reasons why bcp eventually holds for these distances .",
    "on the other hand , it is particularly convenient to note that in the specific case of the heisenberg groups , one also has a fairly simple analytic expression for such distances whose unit ball at the origin is given by an euclidean ball centered at the origin . this will actually be technically extensively used in our proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "this also gives the explicit connection with the cygan - kornyi distance and the distances of negative type considered by lee and naor in @xcite .",
    "set @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "then one has @xmath75 see section  [ section : preliminaries ] .",
    "first , note that @xmath76 is a left - invariant pseudo - distance on @xmath0 that is one - homogeneous with respect to the dilations .",
    "next , when @xmath77 , @xmath78 is nothing but the cygan - kornyi norm which is well known to be a natural gauge in @xmath0 .",
    "it can actually be checked by direct computations that @xmath79 satisfies the triangle inequality for any @xmath80 and hence defines a homogeneous distance on @xmath0 .",
    "this was first proved by cygan in @xcite when @xmath77 .",
    "one then recovers from the analytic expression that @xmath70 actually defines a homogeneous distance on @xmath0 for any @xmath80 , giving also an explicit range of values of @xmath65 in @xmath0 for which this fact holds and was first observed in @xcite for general carnot groups and for small enough values of @xmath65 .    for any @xmath81 , @xmath70 defines a homogeneous distance on @xmath0 .",
    "note that there might be other values of @xmath82 such that @xmath70 defines a homogeneous distance on @xmath0 .",

    "<S> our main result is a positive answer to the question whether one can find homogeneous distances on the heisenberg groups that have the besicovitch covering property ( bcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> this property is well known to be one of the fundamental tools of measure theory , with strong connections with the theory of differentiation of measures . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that bcp is satisfied by the homogeneous distances whose unit ball centered at the origin coincides with an euclidean ball . </S>",
    "<S> such homogeneous distances do exist on any carnot group by a result of hebisch and sikora . in the heisenberg groups , </S>",
    "<S> they are related to the cygan - kornyi ( also called kornyi ) distance . </S>",
    "<S> they were considered in particular by lee and naor to provide a counterexample to the goemans - linial conjecture in theoretical computer science . </S>",
    "<S> to put our result in perspective , we also prove two geometric criteria that imply the non - validity of bcp , showing that in some sense our example is sharp . </S>",
    "<S> our first criterion applies in particular to commonly used homogeneous distances on the heisenberg groups , such as the cygan - kornyi and carnot - carathodory distances that are already known not to satisfy bcp . to put a different perspective on these results and for sake of completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we also give a proof of the fact , noticed by d. preiss , that in a general metric space , one can always construct a bi - lipschitz equivalent distance that does not satisfy bcp . </S>"
