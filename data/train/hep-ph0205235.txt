    "the fundamental quantities one requires in the calculation of scattering processes involving hadronic particles are the parton distributions . these can be derived from and then used within qcd . using the factorization theorem the cross - section for this process can be written in the factorized form @xmath0 up to corrections of order @xmath1 , known as higher twist .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath2 describing the hard scattering process are process dependent but are calculable as a power - series in the strong coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 the @xmath5 are the parton distributions , i.e the probability of finding a parton of type @xmath6 carrying a fraction @xmath7 of the momentum of the hadron . because they depend on the nonperturbative way in which partons are bound into the hadron , these parton distributions are not calculable from first principles .",
    "however , they do evolve with @xmath8 in a perturbative manner @xmath9 where the splitting functions @xmath10 are calculable order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "since the parton distributions @xmath5 are process - independent , i.e. universal , once they have been measured at one experiment , one can predict many other scattering processes .    in order to determine the parton distributions one can use a range of available data  largely @xmath11 ( structure functions ) , and the most up - to - date qcd calculations , which are currently nlo - in-@xmath3 .",

    "perturbation theory is assumed to be valid if @xmath12 so only data with @xmath13 or more are used .",
    "this cut should also remove the influence of higher twists .",
    "the global fit @xcite-@xcite usually proceeds by starting the parton evolution at a low scale @xmath14 , and evolving partons upwards using nlo dglap equations . in principle",
    "there are 11 different parton distributions to consider ( isospin symmetry is assumed , i.e. if @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . )",
    "@xmath18 in practice @xmath19 so the heavy parton distributions are determined perturbatively .",
    "also it is currently assumed that @xmath20 .",
    "the 6 independent parton sets are then @xmath21    the input partons are parameterized in a particular form , e.g. @xmath22 the partons are then constrained by a number of sum rules : @xmath23 i.e. conservation of the number of valence quarks , and conservation of the momentum carried by partons .",
    "the latter is an important constraint on the form of the gluon which is only probed indirectly .    in determining",
    "partons one needs to consider that not only are there 6 different combinations of partons , but there is also a wide distribution of @xmath7 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "one needs many different types of experiment for full determination .",
    "the full set of data usually used is h1 and zeus @xmath26 data @xcite which covers small @xmath7 and a wide range of @xmath8 ; e665 @xmath27 data @xcite at medium @xmath7 ; bcdms and slac @xmath27 data @xcite-@xcite at large @xmath7 ; nmc @xmath27 @xcite at medium and large @xmath7 ; ccfr @xmath28 and @xmath29 data @xcite at large @xmath7 which probe the singlet and valence quarks independently ; zeus and h1 @xmath30 data @xcite ; e605 @xmath31 @xcite constraining the large @xmath7 sea ; e866 drell - yan asymmetry @xcite which determines @xmath32 ; cdf w - asymmetry data @xcite which constrains the @xmath33 ratio at large @xmath7 ; cdf and d0 inclusive jet data @xcite which tie down the high @xmath7 gluon ; and ccfr and nutev dimuon data @xcite which constrain the strange sea .",
    "note that i discuss unpolarized parton distributions .",
    "there are far fewer data for polarized distributions , though fits with error determinations do exist , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is determined by the @xmath34 of the fit to data , which may be calculated in various ways .",
    "the simplest is to add statistical and systematic errors in quadrature .",
    "this ignores correlations between data points , but is sometimes quite effective .",
    "also , the information on the data often means that only this method is available",
    ".    however , more properly one uses the full covariance matrix which is constructed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 runs over each source of correlated systematic error and @xmath37 are the correlation coefficients .",

    "unfortunately this method relies on inverting very large matrices .",
    "an alternative which is identical to the correlation matrix definition of @xmath34 if the errors are small is to incorporate the correlated errors into the theory prediction @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the one - sigma correlated error for point @xmath6 from source @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the @xmath34 is defined by @xmath45 where the second term constrains the values of @xmath46 , assuming the correlated systematic errors are gaussian distributed . in this method",

    "however , it is doubtful that gaussian correlated errors are realistic .",
    "the method also allows one to move data simply to compensate for the shortcomings of theory .",
    "indeed , mrst find that for hera data increments in @xmath34 using this method are the same as for adding in quadrature , and that the data move towards theory rather than _",
    "vice versa _ @xcite .",
    "hence it is questionable in practice quite how much of an improvement this approach is in many cases .",
    "however , for tevatron jet data , where correlated systematic errors dominate , a sophisticated treatment of correlated errors is essential .    using some particular method of calculating @xmath34",

    "one defines the hessian matrix by @xmath56 the hessian matrix @xmath57 is related to the covariance matrix of the parameters by @xmath58 we can then use the standard formula for linear error propagation : @xmath59 this has been used to find partons with errors by @xmath60 @xcite and alekhin @xcite , each with restricted data sets .        in practice",
    "it is problematic due to extreme variations in @xmath61 in different directions in parameter space .",
    "this is solved by finding and rescaling eigenvectors of @xmath57 leading to the diagonal form @xmath62 the method has been implemented by cteq @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty on a physical quantity is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are pdf sets displaced along eigenvector directions by the given @xmath61 .",
    "there is uncertainty in choosing the `` correct '' @xmath61 ( in principle one unit ) given the complications of a full global fit .",
    "cteq choose @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "a discussion of this problem is found in @xcite .          in this case",
    "the best fit is obtained by minimizing @xmath67 i.e. the best fit and parameters @xmath68 are obtained by considering only uncorrelated errors .",
    "this forces the theory to be close to unshifted data .",
    "the quality of the fit is then estimated by adding errors in quadrature .",
    "the systematic errors on the @xmath69 are determined by letting each @xmath70 and adding the deviations in quadrature . in practice one",
    "calculates 2 hessian matrices @xmath71 and defines covariance matrices @xmath72 to achieve the same result .",
    "this was used in early h1 fits @xcite and by zeus",

    "the mean @xmath75 and deviation @xmath76 of observable @xmath77 are then given by @xmath78 while this is statistically correct , and does not rely on the approximation of linear propagation of errors in calculating observables , it is inefficient . in practice ,",
    "one generates @xmath79 different distributions with unit weight but distributed according to @xmath74 where @xmath79 can be made as small as 100 .",
    "then @xmath80 one can incorporate full information about measurements and their error correlations in the calculation of @xmath74 .",
    "currently the authors of @xcite use only proton dis data sets in order to avoid complicated uncertainty issues such as shadowing effects for nuclear targets .",
    "using strict confidence limits they find it difficult to obtain consistency between many different dis experiments .",
    "also the lack of important data sets leads to `` unusual '' values for some parameters , which illustrates the importance of using a wide variety of data .",
    "however , fig .",
    "3 shows that indeed the gaussian approximation is often not good , and shows potential complications for the more simplistic approaches .",
    "this is a very attractive but ambitious large - scale project with a lot of work still to be done .",
    "one can look at the uncertainty on a given physical quantity using the lagrange multiplier method , first suggested by cteq @xcite and also used by mrst @xcite .",
    "one performs the global fit while constraining the value of some physical quantity , i.e. minimizing @xmath81 for various values of @xmath82 .",
    "this gives the set of best fits for particular values of the parameter @xmath83 without relying on the gaussian approximation for @xmath84 .",
    "a useful example is the @xmath85 cross - section at tevatron which is illustrated in fig .",

    "they obtain for @xmath87 @xcite @xmath88 the procedure is also used by mrst for a wider range of data , and using @xmath89 .",
    "they find that for @xmath90 @xcite @xmath91 if @xmath92 also varies , @xmath93 is quite stable but @xmath94 almost doubles .",
    "the @xmath34 profile is shown in fig .",
    "one can repeat for other processes , e.g. hera charged current data are sensitive to very high @xmath7 quarks , the tevatron jet data is sensitive to high @xmath7 gluon _ etc._.    overall",
    "one concludes that the uncertainty due to experimental errors is rather small , however they are dealt with .",
    "it only exceeds a few @xmath95 for quantities related to the high @xmath7 gluon or very high @xmath7 quarks . however , there are other sources of error .",

    "to obtain a complete estimate of errors , one also needs to consider the effect of the assumptions made during the fit .",
    "these include the cuts made on the data , the data sets fit , the parameterization for the input sets , the form of strange sea , the assumption of no isospin violation , _ etc _ .. it is known that many of these can be as important as the experimental errors on data used ( or even more so ) .",
    "a more systematic study is needed .",
    "it is also vital to consider sources of theoretical error .",
    "these include higher twist at low @xmath8 and higher orders in @xmath92 .",
    "the latter are due not only to nnlo corrections , but also to enhancements at large and small @xmath7 because of terms of the form @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this means that renormalization and factorization scale variation are not a reliable way of estimating higher order effects , e.g. , at small @xmath7 @xmath98 whereas @xmath99 and scale variations of @xmath100 never give an indication of these terms .",
    "hence , in order to investigate the    true theoretical error we must consider some way of performing correct large and small @xmath7 resummations , and/or use what we already know about nnlo .",
    "the latter approach implies that some quantities may acquire large higher order corrections @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the empirical approach of investigating in detail the effect of cuts on data . in order to investigate the real quality of the fits and the regions with potential problems we try changing @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , re - fitting and seeing if the fit to the remaining data improves and/or the input parameters change dramatically @xcite .",
