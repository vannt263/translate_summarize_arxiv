    "the first observations of the @xmath2 pentaquark , a five quark bound system of uudd@xmath4 , have been reported in photon - nucleus and kaon - nucleus reactions .",

    "the data that we analyze were taken by the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment , one of the four relativistic heavy ion experiments at rhic .",
    "the large acceptance of star s time projection chamber ( tpc ) is ideal for such rare particle searches .",
    "the short lifetimes predicted for pentaquarks require that a mixing technique be used to reconstruct pentaquarks via their decay products .",
    "this technique has already been used successfully by star to reconstruct and study resonances .",
    "charged daughter particles are identified by the momentum and the energy lost per unit length , @xmath5 , measured with the time projection chamber of star . for long lived particles ( @xmath6 few cm ) such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "the decay vertex topology information is used for their identification .",
    "this method can not be used for pentaquarks since they decay strongly ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "an alternative method , a mixing technique , is used successfully to identify short lived particles such as resonances ( @xmath11 ) and can be used to search for pentaquarks and dibaryons .    in the mixing technique , for example @xmath12 ,",
    "we identify first the @xmath8 s by their decay vertex topology , due to their long lifetime ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this @xmath8 candidate is then combined with a @xmath14 to get @xmath15 .",
    "the background is described by combining @xmath14 s from one event with the @xmath8 s from another event .",
    "similarly for pentaquarks such as @xmath16 , we first identify the @xmath7 via its decay vertex topology and then combine this @xmath7 candidate with a proton candidate in the same event to extract the signal and in a different event to describe the mixing background .",

    "as the efficiency of the mixing technique is @xmath22 and the branching ratio of the @xmath42 is @xmath43 ( assuming that the branching ratios of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 each ) , 20 - 200 of the @xmath34 s can be found with the mixing technique .",
    "the background pairs per event in the 1.54@xmath47 mev mass range is 3200 .",
    "this corresponds to a significance of 0.25 to 3 for the significance defined as @xmath48 .",
    "similarly one can repeat the same study for au+au and d+au collisions and correspondingly predict a significance of 2 - 7 for 1.5 million au+au events and 1 - 16 for 10 million d+au for the predicted production of one @xmath2 per rapidity per collision . to estimate the yield for the d+au collisions we assume @xmath49 scaling .",
    "the mean number of participants in d+au is 8 , in p+p it is 2 , and in au+au it is 350 for the most central collisions .",
    "the lower limit is obtained from p+p scaling while the upper limit is from au+au yield estimates .",
    "preliminary acceptance and efficiency studies show that we should be able to find pentaquarks at the few % level .",
    "resonances can be clearly reconstructed via event mixing techniques in p+p , d+au and au+au central collisions .",
    "optimization of cuts to improve the signal over background is in progress .",
    "there is a possibility of measuring the anti - pentaquarks at rhic since the antibaryon to baryon ratio indicates a nearly net baryon free region @xcite .",
    "100 million events for au+au collisions at @xmath27 gev are planned to be collected in 2004 , run 4 , which has just started .",
    "this would be 70 times the currently available data .",
    "the predicted significance of identifying @xmath2 is at a range of 20 to 84 with the forthcoming data .",
    "we expect to put a more definite upper limit to the yields and production mechanisms of the pentaquarks in au+au collisions with the 2004 run which will finish collecting data at the end of may 2004 ."
