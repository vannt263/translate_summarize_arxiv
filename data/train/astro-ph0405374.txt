    "the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by hot electrons in galaxy clusters leads to a distortion of the cmb spectrum along the line of sight , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz , @xcite ) effect .",
    "the magnitude of the sz effect is determined by the comptonization parameter of the cluster gas , @xmath3 , which is proportional to the line of sight integral of the gas pressure .",
    "it was recognized swiftly @xcite that for an assumed , simple geometry , the combination of x - ray and sz observations can be used to measure the angular diameter distance to a cluster . the ratio of the observed ( based on radio / sub - mm observations ) and predicted ( based on x - ray observations ) sz signals is proportional to the square of the angular diameter distance , making this , potentially , an exceptionally powerful technique for probing the cosmic distance scale .    although the sz effect is now employed frequently to determine extragalactic distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most studies to date have relied on the application of the @xmath4-model @xcite in their x - ray analyses .",
    "the @xmath4-model provides a simple analytical approximation to the spatial distribution of the cluster gas .",
    "these studies have also generally assumed isothermality and relied on broad beam measurements of the mean , emission - weighted temperature when calculating the gas pressure .    with the chandra x - ray observatory and xmm - newton it is now possible to measure the temperature , density and pressure profiles of the cluster gas precisely .",
    "the surface brightness distribution , in particular , can be resolved on sub - arcsecond scales .",
    "chandra observations have shown that @xmath4-models do not , generally , provide good descriptions of the x - ray gas distributions in the cores of dynamically - relaxed clusters , and that the gas temperature is not isothermal but drops sharply within cluster cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main limitation of the new x - ray observations is that ( due to background levels and restricted fields of view ; @xmath5 arcmin@xmath6 for the chandra acis - s detector ) the gas temperature can only be measured directly out to radii @xmath7 one third of the virial radius for most clusters .",
    "since predictions of the sz effect require the line - of - sight pressure integral through the cluster , extrapolation of the x - ray results is therefore required for combined x - ray / sz work .    in this paper",
    "we present a recipe for calculating the predicted sz effect in clusters which makes use of the spatially - resolved spectroscopic techniques described in our earlier work , and which includes a new method for extrapolating the x - ray pressure profiles beyond the directly observed region .",
    "analytical formulae for the electron density and temperature profiles of the x - ray gas at large radii are obtained under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "these can be computed easily and used for sz analysis .",
    "we show that our method , which takes full account of the observed density and temperature profiles of the x - ray emitting gas , provides a significant improvement in accuracy with respect to the standard isothermal @xmath4-model .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the standard @xmath4-model approach and describe our improved method . in section 3",
    "we apply our method to chandra x - ray and sz observations of three highly x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters : rx j1347.5 - 1145 ( @xmath8 ) , abell 1835 ( @xmath9 ) and abell 478 ( @xmath10 ) . in section 4",
    "we use the combined data to measure the hubble constant . in section 5",
    "we compare our results to those obtained using the standard isothermal @xmath4-model approach .",
    "a summary of the results can be found in sect .",

    "the temperature @xmath15 has usually been taken to be the mean emission - weighted temperature of the x - ray gas , determined with broad - beam instruments . however , as discussed in section 1 , observations with the chandra and xmm - newton satellites have shown that regular , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters are not isothermal .",
    "this temperature variation should be accounted for in the analysis .",
    "finally , clusters are not infinitely large , as is usually assumed when calculating the predicted comptonization parameter profile using the @xmath4-model . in what follows",
    "we show how modern x - ray data can be used to integrate eq .",
    "( [ y - integral ] ) without the assumption of isothermality , taking account of the finite size of galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , where the region of the cluster directly observed in x - rays is small , the use of an extrapolation procedure like the one described here can become important .        in order to calculate the expected y - parameter profile ( eq .  [ y - integral ] ) for a particular galaxy cluster , the temperature profile @xmath32 and the electron density profile @xmath33 need to be known . in practise ,",
    "deprojection analyses of chandra or xmm - newton data ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) provide the electron density and x - ray gas temperature in @xmath34 discrete shells , with inner and outer radii @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we can thus recast eq .",
    "( [ y - integral ] ) into a sum starting with shell j at impact parameter @xmath21 : @xmath37 for clusters with temperatures above about 8 kev , relativistic corrections also become significant .",
    "analytic and fitting relations for the relativistic corrections to the sz effect have been worked out by several groups : @xcite . using the analytical formulae of @xcite up to second order",
    ", we determine the relativistic correction factor @xmath38 that needs to be applied to each summand of  ( [ y - sum ] ) , so that @xmath39 .      in the case of the chandra x - ray observatory ,",
    "the detector size and the particle background limit the regions of clusters for which direct temperature measurements can be made ( @xmath40 ) to a fraction of the virial radius . in order to calculate the predicted comptonization parameter",
    "precisely , we need to extrapolate the temperature and electron density profiles out to the edge of the cluster , @xmath41 - or at least past the point where significant contributions to @xmath3 are made . here , for convenience , we will set @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( corresponding to the radii within which the mean enclosed mass density is @xmath44 and @xmath45 times the critical density of the universe @xmath46 at redshift @xmath47 , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath48 is typical of the outer radii for which useful information on the gas temperature profile can be obtained from chandra observations .",
    "@xmath49 is used to mark the outer edge of the cluster .",
    "( in sect .  [ conclusions ] we shall show that the precise choice of @xmath41 does not affect the results significantly . )",
    "we parametrize the total mass distributions in the clusters using an nfw model @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass density , @xmath52 is the scale radius , @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the hubble constant , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath55 and @xmath26 is the concentration parameter with @xmath56 .",

    "we extrapolate the electron density from @xmath60 to @xmath41 using a power - law model @xmath61 .",
    "the hydrostatic equation is then used to determine the temperature solution @xmath32 for that power - law electron density profile in the given nfw potential ( see appendix  [ extrap ] ) .",
    "we fit the exponent @xmath62 of the electron density profile so that the model complies with two fixed quantities :    1 .   the observed temperature @xmath57 at @xmath60 2 .   the _ gas - mass _ weighted temperature @xmath63 at @xmath41 .",

    "the key assumption here is that the gas - mass weighted temperature @xmath66 inside a radius @xmath23 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the mass distribution inside this radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then calculate the change , @xmath67 , of the ratio @xmath68 between @xmath60 and @xmath41 as @xmath69}{t_{{\\rm m},r_2}/\\left[m_{\\rm      tot}(r_2)/r_2 \\right ] } , \\label{lokas}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the total enclosed mass within radius @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 can be computed as a function of the scale radius @xmath52 and the concentration parameter @xmath26 of the nfw profile using the analytical formulae included in appendix  [ lokmam ] .",
    "thus , given both the gas - mass weighted temperature @xmath71 at @xmath60 and a specific nfw mass model from the chandra data , the gas - mass weighted temperature @xmath66 at @xmath41 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ lokas ] ) . for the correct electron density slope @xmath62",

    "we note that in cases where the x - ray data only extend to radii @xmath76 ( within which cooling and/or heating effects may have modified @xmath77 significantly ) , one should extrapolate the gas density ( appendix  [ extrap ] ) from @xmath78 to @xmath49 , use this extrapolation to estimate the gas temperature and density at @xmath42 , and then apply eq .",
    "( [ lokas ] ) between @xmath48 and @xmath49 as usual .",

    "one can immediately see that the application of the isothermal @xmath4-model does not yield a consistent estimate when applied naively to chandra data for the present sample of clusters .",
    "it is also interesting to compare these estimates with previously published @xmath4-model estimates for the clusters discussed here .",
    "we have translated the electron densities from other studies into our assumed cosmology ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "1 .   p01 determined a hubble constant @xmath82 using a @xmath83 kev isothermal model with the @xmath4-model parameters @xmath84 arcsec , @xmath85 and @xmath86@xmath87 from rosat @xcite . using the same temperature and a slightly different @xmath4-model , r02 found an angular diameter distance that implies @xmath88 .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the value we obtain using our fully deprojected and extrapolated cluster model ( tab .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "however , the gas temperature and the other @xmath4-model parameters used by r02 are not consistent with the @xmath4-model parameters from chandra ( tab",
    ".  [ beta - fits ] ) .",
    "2 .   for this cluster ,",
    "m00 measured a hubble constant @xmath89 for a @xmath90 kev isothermal model with the @xmath4-model parameters @xmath91 arcsec , @xmath92 and @xmath93@xmath87 from a fit to rosat data .",
    "this temperature was obtained by allowing for a cooling flow component in the core of the cluster .",
    "r02 obtained an angular diameter distance to the cluster which implies @xmath94 , based on a @xmath95 kev isothermal model ( no cooling flow correction ) .",
    "the difference between these two measurements can be attributed to the different isothermal temperatures and small differences in the assumed @xmath4-model parameters .",
    "note also that the @xmath4-model parameters used in these studies are significantly different from those determined from chandra ( tab .",
    "[ beta - fits ] ) over a smaller range of radii .",
    "this explains the difference in the predicted hubble constant .",
    "however , the m00 result is consistent with the result we obtain from the deprojected and extrapolated x - ray data , which shows that it is possible to partially correct the @xmath4-model in the central region of the cluster when the surface brightness profile observed with the rosat field of view is used . for larger radii",
    "this approximation will fail , however , because of the fixed @xmath4-model slope .",
    "mmr measured a hubble constant @xmath96 assuming an isothermal @xmath97 kev model with the @xmath4-model parameters @xmath98 arcmin , @xmath99 and @xmath100@xmath87 from rosat .",
    "this temperature also accounts for the presence of a cooling flow in the cluster core .",
    "@xcite improved upon the result by mmr by determining the comptonization parameter as a function of radius from a deprojection of the chandra data , and by extrapolating the chandra data with a @xmath4-model based on a fit to the combined surface brightness profile from chandra and rosat .",
    "they used @xmath101 and obtained a hubble constant estimate @xmath102 , which lies between our value and the one obtained by mmr .",
    "we have presented a new method for extrapolating the pressure profiles of galaxy clusters beyond the region accessible to current x - ray satellites such as chandra and xmm - newton , for use in combined x - ray and sz studies .",
    "our method assumes hydrostatic equilibrium , an nfw mass profile for the clusters and predicts the temperature profile and an effective power - law slope of the electron density profile .",
    "the method does not assume isothermality and provides a simple extrapolation recipe that can be easily implemented .",
    "we have applied our method to the chandra data for three x - ray bright , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters , rx j1347.5 - 1145 , abell 1835 and abell 478 , and have obtained detailed temperature , electron density and comptonization parameter profiles for these clusters out to the virial radius .    since all three clusters have published sz detections , we were also able to measure the hubble constant for each , as shown in table  [ results ] .",
    "the individual measurements are consistent with each other and yield a weighted mean of @xmath0 .",
    "this result is consistent with findings from the hubble key project ( @xmath103 ; @xcite ) and combined studies of the cosmic microwave background and x - ray galaxy cluster data ( @xmath104 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that our weighted mean value does not include additional systematical errors , due to , e.g. , clumping or asphericity , although for such regular , relaxed clusters these should be at a minimum .",
    "the contribution to the predicted comptonization parameter from material beyond the regions directly observed with chandra , modelled by our extrapolation procedure , varies from system to system . for rx j1347.5 - 1145",
    "the correction to the comptonization parameter in the region used in table  [ results ] amounts only to @xmath105 per cent and is negligible . for abell 1835",
    ", however , the contribution from material in the extrapolated region amounts to @xmath106 per cent , and for abell 478 the contribution rises to @xmath107 per cent .",
    "this shows that a robust extrapolation method is necessary when combining x - ray and sz observations to infer cosmological information .",
    "we have estimated the effect of changing the outer radius @xmath49 by repeating the calculation for abell 478 , but stopping at @xmath108 .",
    "this leads to a 4.2 per cent smaller average comptonization parameter , well within the observational error bar .",
    "we have compared the comptonization parameter profiles predicted by our method with the profiles obtained by fitting an isothermal @xmath4-model to the chandra data .",
    "we find that a naive application of the @xmath4-model approach leads to profiles with significantly different central comptonization parameters and predicts different slopes for the comptonization parameter profiles at large radii .",
    "the isothermal @xmath4-model also leads to inconsistent hubble constant estimates when applied to the chandra data sets considered here .",
    "it is clear that for galaxy clusters like abell 478 , a field of view larger than the one afforded by the chandra acis - s3 detector would be beneficial . in this respect",
    "the combination of chandra and xmm - newton observations will help ( pointecouteau 2004 ) , although the detector background will still prohibit precise measurements of the temperature profile beyond @xmath109 .",
    "( we also note that the high spatial resolution of chandra is important in resolving the central temperature profile and constraining the best - fit nfw mass models . )",
    "observations for a larger sample of clusters , as well as deeper x - ray and sz observations , should make this a powerful method to explore the cosmological distance scale . in the first case",
