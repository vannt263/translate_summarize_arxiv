    "quasars are routinely used as background sources to study the gaseous phases of intervening objects via absorption - line diagnostics .",
    "these absorption lines have their origins both in _ intervening _ objects ( i.e. , foreground galaxies , inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , quasar host galaxies ) and in sources that are _ intrinsic _ to the quasars .",
    "one of the most promising candidates for the intrinsic absorbers is an outflowing wind from the accretion disk of quasar central engines .",
    "the outflow is accelerated by magnetocentrifugal forces @xcite , radiation pressure in lines and continuum @xcite , and/or by thermal pressure force ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the outflowing winds play an important role in three ways : 1 ) the extraction of angular momenta from disks allows accretions to proceed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to growth of black holes , 2 ) the disk outflow also provides energy and momentum feedback to interstellar media of host galaxies and to intergalactic media ( igm ) , and inhibits star formation activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , 3 ) outflowing winds may induce the metal enrichment of the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the physical conditions of the outflow not only promote the evolution of quasars themselves , but greatly impact the surrounding environments .    among absorption lines , broad features ( hereafter , bals ; fwhm @xmath4 2000  ) are easily identified as being intrinsic , because it is almost impossible for foreground objects to produce very broad and smooth line profiles .",
    "bals are detected in about 10  20% of optically selected quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and their detection rate is slightly higher in radio - quiet quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bals are thought to originate in the outflowing winds when our sight - line intersects this component .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that there are no significant differences in the properties of quasars with bals ( bal  qsos ) and those without bals ( non - bal  qsos ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , quasar spectra tend to be redder when bal profiles , especially those with low ionization absorption lines ( i.e. , lobals and felobals ) , are observed , which is probably caused by dust reddening in the outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , quasars with and without bals may intrinsically be a single population , although the evolutionary phase of quasars could also affect the detection rate of bals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the only difference is whether the sight - line passes through the outflowing wind or not in this orientation scheme .",
    "thus , bal qsos have traditionally been the best targets for the study of outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to bals , a fraction of narrow absorption lines ( hereafter nals ; fwhm @xmath5 500  ) and mini - bals ( an intermediate category between bals and nals ) have also been suggested to be physically associated with quasars .",
    "however , the origin of nals and mini - bals are still under debate .",
    "each of the above classes of absorption features could represent either different lines of sight through the outflowing wind to the quasar continuum source or different stages in the evolution of the absorbing gas parcels ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed fraction of optically - selected quasars hosting bals ( @xmath01020 ) and nals ( @xmath02050% ; e.g. , @xcite ) constrains the solid angle subtended by the dense portion of the wind to the central engine .",
    "however , such a statistical treatment requires the assumption that all quasars are identical .",
    "this remains an assumption because in past studies , it has only been possible to trace _ single _ sight - lines ( i.e. , probe a one dimension profile ) toward the nucleus of each quasar .",
    "gravitationally lensed images of background quasars are our only tools for the study of the three - dimensional geometry of the absorbers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this technique has frequently been applied for investigating intervening absorption lines , produced by galaxies or igm on scales of up to several kilo - parsecs . however , these traditional quasar lenses are not useful for multi - angle studies of the agns themselves because their separation angles ( @xmath1 @xmath0 a few arcsec ) are too small to separate internal structures in the vicinity of the quasars . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite discovered a lensed quasar , sdss  j1004 + 4112 , with a maximum image separation of @xmath1 @xmath0 14@xmath2.6 , which is the first example of a quasar lensed by a cluster of galaxies rather than a single massive galaxy .",
    "if there exists outflow gas at a distance of @xmath01  kpc from the continuum source as measured for some specific quasars @xcite , the large separation angle of sdss  j1004 + 4112 translates into a physical distance of @xmath60.1  pc , with which we may trace outflowing winds with different physical properties unless their transverse sizes are much larger than sub - parsec scale . taking advantage of this large image separation ,",
    "@xcite proposed that the differences in emission lines between the lensed images seen in their follow - up spectra can be explained by differential absorptions along each sight - line , although the spectra do not show explicit intrinsic absorption features .",
    "the second large - separation lensed quasar sdss  j1029 + 2623 @xcite has an image separation of @xmath1 @xmath0 22@xmath2.5 , and therefore is the largest quasar lens currently known .",
    "@xcite identified the third image of this lens system ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f2 ] , all the spectra of quasar images  a , b , and c have absorption features on the blue side of the emission lines , which implies that each sight - line passes through the outflowing wind . in",
    "what follows , we call this feature `` the associated absorption line '' .",
    "moreover , we see a clear difference in the absorption features between image  a and images  b / c .",
    "the former has a broader and shallower profile and an additional redshifted absorption line at @xmath04990 , while the latter two have narrower and deeper profiles ( figure  [ f2 ] ) . after correcting for magnification ,",
    "the eddington ratio of the quasar is estimated to be @xmath7 @xmath0 0.11 .",
    "this value is consistent with the typical eddington ratio of bright quasars , @xmath7 @xmath0 0.07  1.6 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the origin of these differential absorption profiles in sdss  j1029 + 2623 .",
    "the likely scenarios include ( i ) time - variation of a single absorber covering both sight - lines toward the quasar between the time - delay of images  a and b / c , which is @xmath0744 days in the observed frame according to monitoring observations by @xcite ( hereafter , * scenario  i * ) , ( ii ) each sight - line penetrating different absorbers or different regions of a single absorber toward the quasar as proposed by @xcite ( * scenario  ii * ) , and ( iii ) micro - lensing ( * scenario  iii * ) . among these , the last scenario has been already rejected because each image shows common ratios between radio , optical , and x - ray fluxes @xcite , which is not expected for micro - lensing .",
    "thus we concentrate on the viability of scenarios  i and ii , based on our medium- and high - resolution spectroscopic observations of sdss  j1029 + 2623 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "we present results in  3 , and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "we adopt @xmath8 as the emission redshift of the quasar , which was estimated using broad uv emission lines by @xcite .",
    "time intervals between observations are given in the observed frame throughout the paper , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we conducted spectroscopic observation of the two brightest lensed images ( i.e. , images  a and b ) of sdss  j1029 + 2623 with subaru / focas on 2009 april 4 , using a similar resolution power to previous observations ( @xmath9 @xmath0 500 ) taken about 23 years before .",
    "this time separation is comparable to the measured time delay between image  a and images  b / c ( @xmath0744  days ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the grating with l600 filter to cover the wavelength range of @xmath10 = 3700  6000 .",
    "we also used the @xmath11 slit without pixel sampling ( @xmath01.34  per pixel ) , which enables us to compare our spectra with the previous observations from the literature @xcite including sdss @xcite by performing convolution where needed .",
    "the sky conditions were moderate although affected by thin clouds .",
    "the total integration time was 1200  s for each image , and the data quality of the final spectra are s / n @xmath08.5  pix@xmath12 and @xmath07.0  pix@xmath12 for images  a and b , respectively .",
    "we also obtained high - resolution spectra of images  a and b with subaru / hds on 2010 february 10 to resolve the associated absorption line completely and extract physical parameters such as column density , line width , ejection velocity from the quasar , and the covering factor ( the fraction of flux from the background source that is geometrically covered by the foreground absorber ) using voigt profile fitting .",
    "we used the standard setup , std - bc , with a @xmath13 slit width ( @xmath9=30,000 ) , covering the wavelength range of 33904210   on the blue ccd and 42805110    on the red ccd .",
    "this configuration covers ly@xmath14 , , as well as the absorption line at  @xmath0 .",
    "the ccd is binned every 4 pixels in both spatial and dispersion directions ( i.e. , @xmath00.05  per pixel and each resolution element contains three pixels around 4500 ) . the total integration times were 14400  s and 14200  s for images  a and b , respectively , and the final s / n ratios are about 13  pix@xmath12 for both the images .",
    "we reduced both the focas and hds data in a standard manner with the software iraf .",
    "as for the hds spectra , we divided them by a flat frame before normalization in order to remove the instrumental blaze pattern .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using a th - ar lamp .",
    "the observation log is summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "we examined the suite of subaru / focas spectra to search for variability in the lines .",
    "if absorption in both the images show time - variations , it would imply that the profiles are variable and that the scenario  i is more favorable .",
    "if this is the case , we have monitored a single absorber in five epochs on 2006 february 28 + 744  days , 2006 june 29 + 744  days , 2009 april 4 + 744  days ( toward image  a ) , and on 2007 december 15 , 2009 april 4 ( toward image  b ) .",
    "if neither images show time variation , the scenario  ii will instead be favored .      the associated absorption line of the image  a was spectroscopically observed three times on 2006 february 28 @xcite , on 2006 june 29 @xcite , and on 2009 april 4 ( this paper ) , as shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the first one was part of the sdss , while the others were taken with subaru / focas .",
    "for inter - comparison , we adjust the spectral resolution of all observations to that lowest available ( i.e. , @xmath9 @xmath0 500 ) by resampling and convolution .",
    "the emission and absorption features show a so - called p - cygni profile , which implies that the absorption feature is physically associated to the quasar itself .",
    "an additional weak absorption feature is seen on the red side of the emission line at @xmath10 @xmath0 4990 . however , this is not , but  @xmath102600 at  @xmath0 0.9187 , because there exists a corresponding doublet at the same redshift .",
    "we do not see any substantial variation of the absorption profile ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the associated absorption line of image  b was spectroscopically observed only twice : once on 2007 december 15 with keck / lris by @xcite , and once on 2009 april 4 by us with subaru / focas .",
    "@xcite also obtained a spectrum of image  c. images  b and c show profiles that are almost identical near the absorption / emission lines , which is probably because the separation angle between them , @xmath15 @xmath0 1@xmath2.85 , is much smaller than the separations between images  a and b ( @xmath16 @xmath0 22@xmath2.5 ) and images  a and c ( @xmath17 @xmath0 21@xmath2.0 ) .",
    "our focas spectrum of image  b is consistent with those of images  b and c taken about 15 months ( @xmath04.7 month in the rest - frame ) before .    under scenario",
    "i , time - variation is to be expected .",
    "instead , we confirm that the absorption profile of each image is stable ( see figure  [ f2 ] ) , suggesting that scenario  i is less likely to be true",
    ". however , this conclusion based on our medium - resoluton spectroscopy will have to be modified significantly , following investigation of the high - resolution spectra , as we will see in the next subsection .      from our high - resolution ( @xmath9 = 30,000 ) spectra of images  a and b , we find that the associated absorption line consists of multiple narrower components ( figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the system is not a bal ( or a mini - bal ) but nal , which means that the features are not necessarily arising at the outflow .",
    "if the corresponding absorber is the ism of the host galaxy , igm , or a foreground galaxy ( i.e. , intervening absorption ) , both the differential absorption profiles and the lack of time - variation toward images  a and b are reasonable because their sight lines pass through completely different regions separated by @xmath0kpc or @xmath0mpc scales with respect to each other .    in order to classify the associated absorption feature as an intrinsic or intervening feature",
    ", we performed a voigt profile fitting to measure line parameters .",
    "we used the line fitting software package minfit @xcite , with which we can fit absorption profiles using redshift ( @xmath18 ) , column density ( @xmath19 in ) , doppler parameter ( @xmath20 in ) , and covering factor ( , defined later in  3.2.1 ) as free parameters .",
    "the revised version of the code can be applied to self - blending features , because it fits profiles to the blue and red members of doublets _ simultaneously _ , by multiplying the contributions from the two doublet members @xcite .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "column ( 1 ) is a line identification ( i d ) number .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the absorption redshift and the ejection velocity ( negative corresponds to blueshifted ) from the quasar emission redshift ,  @xmath02.197 .",
    "columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are the column density and its 1@xmath21 error , columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , the doppler parameter and its 1@xmath21 error , and columns ( 8) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) , the covering factors and its upper / lower 1@xmath21 error .",
    "we also applied line fitting to the doublet .",
    "the doublet can not be fitted in both the images , because the red member of the doublet ,  @xmath101403 , is severely affected by line contamination .",
    "covering factor , , is the fraction of coverage of the absorber over the continuum source and the broad emission line region ( belr ) along the sight - line .",
    "the covering factor can be systematically evaluated in an unbiased manner by considering the optical depth ratio of resonant , rest - frame uv doublets of lithium - like species ( e.g. , , , and ) , using the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the residual ( i.e. , unabsorbed ) fluxes of the blue and red members of the doublets in the continuum normalized spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a  value less than unity indicates that a portion of the background source is not occulted by the absorber .",
    "this , in turn , means that the doublet is probably produced by an intrinsic absorber because intervening absorbers like igm , ism , and foreground galaxies usually have physical scales with a few kilo - parsecs much larger than the background sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in general , the continuum source and the belr have different covering factors , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the derived coverage fractions can be significantly affected by uncertainty of the continuum level , providing unphysical values ( i.e. ,  @xmath25 0 or 1 @xmath25 ) , especially for very weak components whose  values are close to 1 .",
    "therefore , if minfit gives unphysical values of  for some components in the first trial , we rerun the fit assuming = 1 , following the procedure detailed in @xcite .",
    "the fitting results for and doublets are shown in figures  [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] , and fitting parameters are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .      in our high - resolution spectrum ,",
    "the associated absorption line is deblended into at least 16 narrow components at  @xmath0 @xmath261600  ",
    "94  from the quasar emission redshift at  @xmath0 2.197 , as shown in the  @xmath101548 panel of figures  [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] . among the 16 components ,",

    "those at  @xmath0 @xmath261400  have only subtle doublets .",
    "it is difficult to tell whether doublets corresponding to the system exist or not because the  @xmath101394 blends with  @xmath101527 at  = 1.9115 and 1.9141 , and because the  @xmath101403 is also severely contaminated by doublets at  = 1.8909  1.9141 .",
    "the absorption component at  @xmath0 800  in the  @xmath101548 panel is not but instead  @xmath102344 at  @xmath0 0.9187 .",
    "we also confirm that a strong absorption feature at @xmath10 @xmath0 4900  only seen in image  a of figure  [ f2 ] is  @xmath102600 at the same redshift .",
    "it follows that the differential absorption profile of the associated absorption line between images  a and b seen in low - resolution spectra ( figure  [ f2 ] ) is mainly due to these physically unrelated lines .",
    "the associated line is deblended into 12 narrow components at  @xmath0 @xmath261467  9.4  from the quasar emission redshift as shown in the  @xmath101548 panel of figures  [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] .",

    "* the associated nals show clear evidence of partial coverage ( see figure  [ f4 ] and table  [ t2 ] ) .",

    "based on multiple medium - resolution spectra , we confirmed that the associated absorption lines toward both images  a and b retain their profiles unchanged , while their profiles are clearly different each other .",
    "this result was originally expected to reject the time - variation scenario ( i.e. , scenario  i ) . however , with the high - resolution spectrograph , the associated absorption lines are deblended into multiple narrow components , of which two are foreground absorption lines of  @xmath102344 and  @xmath102600 at  @xmath0 0.9187 .",
    "we confirmed that the differential absorption profiles between the lensed images seen in medium - resolution spectra are mainly due to these physically unrelated lines .",
    "thus , we can not distinguish different scenarios with medium - resolution spectra alone .",
    "high - resolution spectra taken with subaru / hds provide us with several important clues regarding the origin of the associated lines .",
    "first of all , the general profiles of the absorption lines toward images  a and b are very similar to each other .",
    "this means that the size of the absorber must be larger than the transverse distance of the two sight - lines .",
    "in the extreme case , the absorber s location would be very close to the background flux source so as to make the separation angle almost negligible .",
    "second , we see a clear difference of absorption profiles between images  a and b in various structures . for example , at  @xmath0 0  200  , there exist additional absorption components in , , ly@xmath14  panels of figure  [ f6 ] only in image  a. this small difference , discovered only after taking high - resolution spectra , reminds us of the original question : what is the source of this difference ? finally , the most important clue is that a substantial fraction of absorption components show partial coverage , which means that the physical sizes of the absorbers are smaller than or comparable to the background source such as the continuum source and the belr .",
    "while some intrinsic absorption lines cover only the continuum source ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the covering factors toward the continuum source and the belr usually take specific values , depending on the relative strengths of their fluxes @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the residual flux at @xmath10 @xmath0 4948   , at which the emission line peaks , is almost zero .",
    "this means that absorbers as a whole cover both the continuum source and the belr significantly .",
    "therefore , size estimation of the flux sources is important .",
    "we estimate the size of the belr ( @xmath32 ) using the empirical relation between @xmath32 and quasar luminosity .",
    "this relation was originally discovered through reverberation mapping @xcite and then extended to brighter quasars with monochromatic luminosities of @xmath2710@xmath33  ergs  s@xmath12 to redshifts  @xmath27 0.7 ( eq.[a4 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the monochromatic luminosity of image  a at @xmath34 = 3000  in the quasar rest - frame is measured in @xcite as @xmath35 = 46.21 ergs  s@xmath12 . after correcting the magnification factor of image  a , @xmath36 = 10.4 @xcite",
    ", we estimate @xmath32 to be @xmath0 0.09@xmath37 pc , where the main source of 1@xmath21 uncertainty comes from the scatter in the empirical relation in @xcite .    as to the size of the continuum source ( @xmath38 ) , we take five times the schwarzschild radius , @xmath39 = 10@xmath40 , following @xcite , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the schwarzschild radius and mass of the central black hole .",
    "the virial mass of the central black hole is already calculated in @xcite using the luminosity and fwhm of broad emission lines of image  a. again , after correcting for magnification , we obtain @xmath43 = 8.72 , and then @xmath38 is evaluated to be @xmath0 2.54@xmath44@xmath45 pc .",
    "this is almost 300 times smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "the size of the background flux source ( @xmath9 ) and the absorber s distance from the central flux source ( @xmath46 ) decide geometry , i.e. , a single sight - line or multiple sight - lines .",
    "the transverse distance of the two sight - lines ( @xmath47 ) can be calculated as @xmath47 = @xmath48 , where @xmath1 is the separation angle of the two sight - lines seen from the flux source ( which is very similar to the separation angle seen from us , @xmath1 @xmath0 22@xmath2.5 ) . at a distance , where @xmath9 @xmath5 @xmath47 (= @xmath48 ) is satisfied ,",
    "the two sight - lines become fully separated with no overlap .",
    "we call this distance a boundary distance ( @xmath49 ) , hereafter ( see figure  [ f7]a ) .",
    "the boundary distance is @xmath49 @xmath02.3  pc if only the continuum source is the flux source , and @xmath0788 pc if the belr is also the background source .",
    "the latter is comparable to the distance of outflowing gas measured by @xcite and @xcite for other quasars .",
    "the geometry also depends on the absorber s size ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "if the size of the absorber ( whose internal sub - structure is ignored here ) is much larger than the transverse distance ( i.e. , @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 ) , a single sight - line scenario is applicable regardless of the absorber s distance from the flux source ( see figure  [ f7]b ) . however",
    ", this geometry can not be applied to our case because the partial coverage we found in ",
    "[ sec3.2 ] requires the size of each absorber to be comparable or smaller than the size of background source . on the other hand , if @xmath50 @xmath5 @xmath52 ( figure  [ f7]c ) , we should analyze the condition in more detail . in the case of @xmath50 @xmath5 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath9",
    "( i.e. , the absorber s distance is smaller than the boundary distance ) , a substantial fraction of both sight - lines is covered by a single absorber although the fraction depends on the distance and the absorber s size .",
    "small differences of absorption profiles , seen in the high - resolution spectra of images  a and b , can be explained either by i ) a different part of the absorber s outskirts covering each sight - line ( _ quasi-_scenario  ii ) , or by ii ) time - variation ( scenario  i ) . in the case of @xmath50 @xmath5 @xmath9 @xmath5 @xmath48",
    "( i.e. , the absorber s distance is larger than the boundary distance ) , this will be _ bona - fide _",
    "scenario  ii .",
    "one shortcoming of this model is that we can not reproduce common absorption profiles seen in the two sight - lines because the same absorber can not cover both sight - lines .",
    "we will discuss this problem later .",
    "@xcite claimed that nal absorbers should be located in a low gravity environment far from the central bh in order to maintain kinematic stability .",
    "their result suggests that the ejection velocity of nal absorbers is larger than the escape velocity so that the absorber is gravitationally unbound . if the nal absorbers in our target quasar are also in a similar kinematic condition , their radial distance from the central bh should be @xmath46 @xmath4 1.79  pc .",
    "this is close to the boundary distance in the case that only the continuum source is the background flux source . as a result",
    ", we do not have any conclusive evidence to either accept or reject scenarios  i or ii .",
    "therefore , we will discuss the absorber s physical condition further assuming both scenarios in turn below .      if scenario  i represents reality , there are two possible origins of time variability , i ) a change of ionization condition of the absorber ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ii ) the absorber moving across our sight lines to change the covering factor ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". neither situation is applicable for the case of intervening absorbers as discussed in @xcite .    if a change in ionization is the origin of variation , we can place constraints on the electron density and the distance from the flux source following the procedure by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we can not evaluate the specific ionization condition because a wide range of ionic species ( which is necessary for photoionization modeling ) are not detected in our spectra .",
    "therefore , by adopting the following assumptions ; i ) the gas is very close to ionization equilibrium , ii ) the change of ionizing flux is small , and iii ) is the dominant ionization stage of carbon , we estimate the electron density to be @xmath54 @xmath0 @xmath55 @xmath0 1.78@xmath4410@xmath56 @xmath57 by assuming a variation timescale in the quasar rest frame ( @xmath0233 days ) as a recombination time ( @xmath58 ) , where we use the recombination coefficient of @xmath59 in gas temperature of 20,000  k @xcite . because the variation timescale is an upper limit of the recombination time , we should regard the electron density as a lower limit .",
    "we can also evaluate the distance of the absorber from the flux source using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter ( @xmath60 ) depends on the bolometric luminosity of the quasar , the continuum shape , distance from the flux source , and electron density . by adopting the continuum shape of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the distance of the absorber to be @xmath46 @xmath50.44 kpc , with an ionization parameter of @xmath60 = 0.02 ( in which is the dominant ionization stage ; @xcite ) , and the bolometric luminosity of the quasar of @xmath61 = 45.87 erg  s@xmath12 @xcite",
    ". the limits on the electron density and the absorber s distance are consistent with the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the gas motion ( i.e. , crossing of our sight - line ) is the origin of variation , we can simply estimate the average crossing velocity ( @xmath62 @xmath0 @xmath63 ) to be @xmath0390  if the continuum source is the only background source .",
    "again , this is the minimum velocity because @xmath3 is an upper limit on the variability timescale .",
    "the belr should not be the flux source , because the corresponding crossing velocity , @xmath01.32@xmath4410@xmath64  , is comparable to the speed of light .",
    "thus , we conclude that the absorber covers primarily the uv continuum source with only a small part of the belr if the gas motion is the origin of variation .      the main problem of the _ bona - fide _",
    "scenario  ii model , in which the absorber s size is smaller than the transverse distance of the two sight - lines , is that we can not reproduce closely similar absorption profiles seen in the two sight - lines because the same absorbers can not cover both sight - lines .",
    "a possible solution for this is that there exists a number of clumpy absorbers or fluctuations in gas density ( whose sizes are smaller than the background source ) constituting a filamentary ( or a sheet - like ) structure that covers both sight - lines ( figure  [ f7]c ) .",
    "such a structure is well reproduced above the main body of the outflow by hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g , @xcite ) .    here , we calculate the radial mass - outflow rate ( @xmath65 ) toward the two sight - lines summing contributions from all absorption components as @xmath66 where @xmath67(@xmath68 ) and @xmath69(@xmath68 ) are the total ( @xmath28 ) hydrogen column density and the radial depth of the @xmath68-th absorption component toward a sight - line . @xmath9 and @xmath70 are the size of background source and the proton mass . in  [ sec3.2 ] , we measured ejection velocities of all and absorption components by applying voigt profile fitting .",
    "however , their absolute values could be underestimated because emission redshifts determined from broad uv emission lines are systematically blueshifted from the systemic redshift , as measured by narrow , forbidden lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find a mean blueshift of the broad uv emission lines relative to the systemic redshift of about 260  and that 90% of the blueshifts are between 0 and 650  .",
    "we therefore add 260  to the  values given in table  [ t2 ] for the calculation herein .    because our spectra do not detect a wide range of ionic species ( which are necessary for photoionization modeling , as described in  [ sec4.3.1 ] ) , we can measure neither the ionization condition nor the total hydrogen column density @xmath71(h ) .",
    "these parameters decide an absorber s metallicity and radial depth .",
    "therefore , we simply calculate @xmath65 assuming all absorption components have the same ionization condition , metallicity , and radial depth toward both the sight - lines as follows , @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( a metallicity - ionization correction ) for and are defined as follows , respectively , @xmath74 @xmath75    based on the and absorption lines , a difference of radial mass - outflow rates toward images  a and b is only @xmath030  35% , which suggests that internal fluctuation of the nal absorber is almost negligible within the angular distance of @xmath1 @xmath0 22@xmath2.5 .",
    "because @xmath020 ",
    "50%  of quasars have at least one intrinsic nal absorber in their spectra @xcite , the global covering factor of the central flux source surrounded by nal absorbers can have values of @xmath76 @xmath5 0.8@xmath77  2@xmath77 in terms of solid angle .",
    "thus , small areas within @xmath00.002%   0.005%  of the total solid angle for nal absorbers produce similar absorption profiles with the same order of total column densities . in other words",
    ", the outflow wind corresponding to the nal absorbers can be divided into @xmath520,000  50,000 small zones with common physical conditions .",
    "we carried out medium - resolution spectroscopy of the two brightest images of the quasar sdss  j1029 + 2623 to see whether the associated absorption lines are variable or not , and also high - resolution spectroscopy in order to measure line parameters and place strict constraints on the absorber s physical conditions .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the associated absorption profile does not show clear time - variation toward either sight - lines in medium - resolution spectra . with high - resolution spectra , we confirmed that the differential line profile is mainly due to the effect of  @xmath102344 and  @xmath102600 lines which arise in a physically unrelated system at  @xmath0 0.9187 .",
    "2 .   in high - resolution spectra",
    ", the associated absorption line is deblended into more than 10 narrow components , showing i ) partial coverage , ii ) line - locking , iii ) large velocity distribution , and iv ) small ejection velocity .",
    "all of these results support the associated absorption line being physically related to the quasar ( i.e. , _ intrinsic _ absorption line ) .",
    "the associated absorber probably covers both the continuum source and the belr because the residual flux at @xmath10 @xmath0 4948   , at which the emission line peaks , is almost zero .",
    "the size of the continuum source and the belr are evaluated to be @xmath38 @xmath0",
    "2.54@xmath44@xmath45 pc and @xmath78 @xmath0 0.09@xmath37 pc , respectively .",
    "if the associated absorber covers both the flux sources toward our sight - lines , their typical scale should be comparable to or smaller than @xmath32 because they show partial coverage .",
    "4 .   the geometry of the associated absorber depends on the sizes of the background flux source ( @xmath9 ) and the absorber ( @xmath50 ) , and the absorber s distance from the center ( @xmath46 ) . if a single sight - line model represents reality , the differential line profile impies time variation of the absorber .",
    "if a change of ionization level is the origin of the variation , we can place constraints on the absorber s electron density , @xmath54 @xmath5 1.78@xmath4410@xmath56 @xmath57 , and the absorber s distance from the continuum source , @xmath46 @xmath5 0.44  kpc .",
    "if gas motion is the origin of variation , the continuum source is the only background source because the estimated crossing velocity is too large ( comparable to the speed of light ) if the belr is also the flux source .",
    "5 .   if multiple sight - line model is the real scenario , the following condition should be satisfied ; the absorber s size ( @xmath50 ) @xmath5 the size of the background flux source ( @xmath9 ) @xmath5 transverse distance of the two sight - lines ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , such a condition can not allow a single absorber to cover both sight - lines , in order to reproduce similar absorption profiles as seen in the high - resolution spectra . a filamentary ( or a sheet - like )",
    "structure made of multiple clumpy gas clouds could solve this issue .",
    "indeed , such structures are reproduced by hydro - dynamical simulations .    in order to assess the origin of the associated absorber",
    "further , we need to obtain high - resolution spectra again .",
    "we have shown that monitoring observations with medium - resolution spectra are not useful because the associated absorption line in the image  a is significantly contaminated with physically unrelated foreground absorption lines .",
    "additional high - resolution spectra will provide us with stronger evidence for scenario  i if we see clear time - variations or for scenario  ii if the images do not show variability .",

    "<S> we study the origin of absorption features on the blue side of the broad emission line of the large - separation lensed quasar sdss  j1029 + 2623 at @xmath02.197 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar images , produced by a foreground cluster of galaxies , have a maximum separation angle of @xmath1 @xmath0 22@xmath2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the large angular separation suggests that the sight - lines to the quasar central source can go through different regions of outflowing winds from the accretion disk of the quasar , providing a unique opportunity to study the structure of outflows from the accretion disk , a key ingredient for the evolution of quasars as well as for galaxy formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> based on medium- and high - resolution spectroscopy of the two brightest images conducted at the subaru telescope , we find that each image has different intrinsic levels of absorptions , which can be attributed either to variability of absorption features over the time delay between the lensed images , @xmath3 @xmath0 744  days , or to the fine structure of quasar outflows probed by the multiple sight - lines toward the quasar . while both these scenarios are consistent with the current data , we argue that they can be distinguished with additional spectroscopic monitoring observations . </S>"
