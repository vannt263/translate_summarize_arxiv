    "one particularly interesting phase is the stripe ( str ) bec , which simultaneously breaks the u(1 ) symmetry and the translational invariance symmetry . in current experiments with rb gases",
    "@xcite , due to the slight difference between inter- and intra - species interactions , the stripe phase is expected to exist only in the weak raman coupling regime  @xcite . at a critical raman strength , a first order transition between the str phase and plane - wave ( pw ) phase takes place  @xcite .",
    "since the pw condensate is almost fully - polarized in this regime , the str - pw transition can be also regarded as a consequence of the competition between the crystalline order and the ferromagnetic order .",
    "so far , the spatial density modulation in the stripe phase has not been directly observed experimentally .",
    "the major difficulties are the small contrast of the stripes and the limited resolution of _ in - situ _ imaging .",
    "nevertheless , a miscible - immiscible transition has been identified at a value of the raman strength @xcite , which is close to the theoretically predicted critical point of the str - pw transition . very recently",
    ", the temperature dependence of the phase boundary is experimentally determined through the statistical analysis of magnetization measurements @xcite .    previously , most theoretical works focused on the ground state properties and quantum dynamics of the str phase and the pw phase  @xcite ; very few studies pay attention to the thermal effects at finite temperature  @xcite . in particular , to our knowledge , the influence of thermal fluctuations on the str - pw transition has not been addressed in the literature . in this work ,",
    "we develop a perturbation approach to resolve this problem in the weak raman coupling regime . by expanding the equation of state in terms of the raman strength up to the second order",

    "an alternative argument is based on the fact that the free energy of the str / pw phase should not depend on the sign of @xmath10 ; hence the linear term in the expansion must vanish .",
