    "following the suggestion of weinberg @xcite and the pioneering work of ordoez , ray and van kolck @xcite , there has been much interest in using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to calculate long - range contributions to the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) force .",
    "scattering , see ref .",
    "] these have concentrated on two - pion exchange ( tpe ) @xcite , although work has also started on three - pion exchange @xcite . in an effective field theory like this ,",
    "the residual short - distance interactions are represented by energy- or momentum - dependent contact interactions .",
    "these can be expanded in powers of the ratios between momenta or the pion mass and the scale of the physics which is responsible for these short - range interactions , for example the mass of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "provided these ratios are small enough , this expansion should converge rapidly .",
    "nucleon - nucleon scattering in peripheral waves provides the best place to look for clear signals of the long - range tpe force .",
    "various groups have done so @xcite but they often find quite large deviations from the  experimental \" phase shifts deduced from partial - wave analyses @xcite .",
    "this has led some to resort to introducing phenomenological cut - offs @xcite or additional degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "recently the nijmegen group has started carrying out pwa s which include chiral tpe @xcite and they find that this makes significant improvements to their fits .",
    "the large differences between their results and available chpt predictions have led to a claim that the fits can not yield reliable values for parameters in the tpe potential @xcite .",
    "however it is hard to make a direct comparison between the nijmegen analyses and chpt because they are done with a coordinate - space cut - off of 1.4 fm or larger .",
    "this means that short - distance parameters in the fits have to play two roles .",
    "as well as parametrising true short - range physics they also have to correct for artefacts introduced by the cut - off . hence one can not immediately tell from the nijmegen parametrisation whether the residual short - range interactions are consistent with an effective field theory .",
    "distorted wave ( dw ) methods can be used to extract the effects of a known long - range interaction from two - body scattering , leaving a residual scattering amplitude which can be analysed using the techniques of effective field theory @xcite . for systems with bound states close to threshold , such as @xmath5 @xmath7-waves ,",
    "this is equivalent to a dw version of the effective - range expansion . in peripheral waves , where the scattering is weak",
    ", the effective short - range potential is essentially just an expansion of the residual @xmath8-matrix in powers of the energy .",
    "related approaches can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite where a variable - phase method is used to construct the dw s and a radial cut - off is imposed at some small radius .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite include tpe but do not attempt to extract a residual interaction strength , only examining the sensitivity of their results to the cut - off radius .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar treatment . ) pavon valderrama and ruiz arriola @xcite keep only ope and parametrise the residual interaction via a boundary condition at their cut - off radius .",
    "this is constructed to reproduce exactly the effective - range expansion up to fourth order in the momentum .",
    "peripheral partial waves are of particular interest for testing @xmath5 potentials from chpt , since the nucleons do not feel the very strong attraction that causes complications in the @xmath7-waves @xcite .",
    "however phase shifts in a wave with orbital angular momentum @xmath9 typically grow like the @xmath9-th power of the energy .",
    "this means that quite small differences between the short - distance behaviour of potentials can lead to phase shifts that look very different at energies @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , at low energies , small differences between phase shifts can be hard to disentangle .",
    "in particular , differences between the available pwa s in this region can be comparable in size to the tpe effects of interest , but this is not always obvious in simple plots of phase shifts . by applying the dw method to empirical phase shifts , we are able to obtain a residual interaction strength that is much less energy dependent than the phase shifts themselves .",
    "this has the advantage of providing a quantitative measure of the strength of the missing physics and of its energy dependence .",
    "it also makes much clearer the regions where the pwa results are not reliable .",
    "here we use the dw method to examine @xmath5 scattering in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 partial waves using the phase shifts from five available nijmegen analyses : pwa93 , and the nijmegen i , nijmegen ii , reid93 and esc96 potentials @xcite .",
    "all of these include the long - range ope potential but otherwise they parametrise the data quite differently .",
    "for example , the pwa imposes an energy - dependent boundary condition at a cut - off radius of 1.4 fm , while the potentials are energy - independent but may be either local or nonlocal .",
    "all of them have been fitted with similarly good @xmath11 to to the @xmath5 data available in 1993 , and so they can be regarded as alternative pwa s .",
    "any differences between these analyses should be taken as indications of the size of the systematic errors associated with them .",
    "the reason for concentrating initially on the spin - singlet waves is that the ope potential is less singular than the centrifugal barrier and hence no regularisation is needed to construct the distorted waves .",
    "the need for some additional regulator in the triplet waves means that the short - range potential would have to play two roles , correcting for artefacts of the regulator as well as parametrising short - range physics , and so it would be harder to interpret .",
    "the terms in the interaction can be classified according to a chiral expansion in powers of @xmath12 , where @xmath12 denotes a factor of either a momentum or a pion mass @xcite . in this counting",
    "the leading ope potential is of order @xmath13 .",
    "we use the tpe potential given in refs .",
    "this includes terms up to order @xmath0 @xcite . as discussed by friar @xcite",
    ", this potential should be used in conjunction with an ope potential that has the usual nonrelativistic form ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : npope ] ) below ) multiplied by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the on - shell energy of one nucleon .",
    "this factor generates recoil corrections to ope which start at order @xmath16 .",
    "other corrections to ope which might arise from higher - order @xmath4 vertices can all be absorbed in the on - shell @xmath4 couplings or @xmath5 contact terms ( as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or in higher - order terms in the expansion of @xmath14 .",
    "the order-@xmath16 recoil correction to ope plus tpe terms from ref .",
    "@xcite therefore provide the complete long - range potential at orders @xmath16 and @xmath0 , with one exception : we use a single @xmath4 coupling constant . at this order there could be isospin breaking in the @xmath4 couplings @xcite , a point to which we shall return later . by using the dw method to extract all iterations of ope and then subtracting these ope and tpe terms",
    ", we are able to remove all contributions to the scattering up to order @xmath0 in the chiral expansion .",

    "@xcite is the @xmath8-matrix which describes scattering between distorted waves of the known long - range potential , in our case ope . on shell",

    "we use the same value of the @xmath4 coupling as in the nijmegen pwa s @xcite , @xmath26 .",
    "the waves are obtained by solving a schrdinger equation with this potential . as expained in ref .",
    "@xcite , relativistic effects can , to the order we are working , be absorbed into terms in the tpe potential and a factor of @xmath14 multiplying the ope potential . with standing - wave boundary conditions appropriate to the @xmath8-matrix ,",
    "the dw s have the asymptotic form @xmath27 near the origin , they behave like @xmath28    if the residual scattering is weak , we can represent it using an effective theory based on a trivial fixed point @xcite .",
    "the residual @xmath8-matrix @xmath17 is then equal to the matrix element of an energy - dependent short - range potential , in the dw born approximation .",
    "a simple @xmath29-function potential will have no effect since the waves with @xmath30 vanish at the origin .",
    "we could use an appropriate high derivative of a @xmath29-function to represent the short - range interactions but , for numerical implementation , it is more convenient to work with an energy - dependent @xmath29-shell potential , @xmath31 ^ 2\\over 4\\pi r_0^{2l+2}}\\,\\tilde v(p)\\,\\delta(r - r_0),\\ ] ] provided @xmath32 is chosen to be sufficient small that the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asyr0 ] ) is valid , this form is numerically equivalent to a derivative of a @xmath29-function .",

    "the current chpt potentials do not include the @xmath51 , which also corresponds to a scale of about 300  mev .",

    "150250 mev , the uncertainties are so large as to preclude much more than a rough estimate of the magnitude of the residual potential . only in the @xmath1 wave",
    "does one find consistent results over a wide range of energies , from about 50 mev upwards .",
    "one point to note about the @xmath1 and @xmath3 waves is that we find no correlation among the deviations of the different pwa s from their common trend .",
    "this suggests that there is no systematic bias to the fits .",
    "second , it is important to use the  correct \" @xmath4 coupling , namely the one assumed in the pwa , and to include the @xmath14 factor multiplying ope ( or at least the leading correction from it ) . if these are not done then the results show a strong systematic energy dependence at low energies .",

    "[ fig:1d2 ] , subtraction of the order-@xmath38 terms may not have much effect on the size of the residual scattering , but it does dramatically reduce its energy dependence .",
    "there is a nearly 100% change over the energy range 50 to 300 mev if ope alone is removed , but this is reduced to about 20% when the order-@xmath38 terms are subtracted .",
    "the typical size of the residual strength after removal of ope , @xmath70 , is about 0.1  @xmath65 . comparing this with eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2size ] ) we find that the corresponding scale @xmath50 is approximately 300  mev , as expected for pion - exchange forces .",
    "ater subtracting ope and tpe to order @xmath0 , the residual short - range potential is , to a very good approximation , linearly dependent on the energy . its intercept occurs at about @xmath71  @xmath65 , which corresponds to a momentum scale of about 200  mev in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v4size ] ) .",
    "this is distinctly smaller than one would expect on grounds of  naturalness \" .",
    "its slope is @xmath72 @xmath67 , corresponding to a scale of about 370  mev .",
    "this picture bears out what was found in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely that one counterterm of order @xmath40 is able to explain the bulk of the residual scattering after all contributions up to order @xmath0 have been removed .",
    "one might worry that those authors neglected the recoil correction to ope .",
    "however in this channel the tpe contributions are so much larger that the neglect of recoil does not affect the results significantly .",
    "at least for the spin - singlet channels , this analysis also removes the worries raised in ref .",
    "@xcite : although there is one unnaturally large term in the effective short - range potential , there is no evidence for a breakdown of the chiral expansion , even up to energies of @xmath73 mev .    in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases",
    "there are large differences between the various pwa s for energies below about 150  mev and so it is hard to draw such definite conclusions . nonetheless it is clear that the residual scattering is much smaller after the order-@xmath38 terms have been subtracted , as in the results of refs .",
    "the sizes of the residual scattering strengths , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , at energies below 100  mev in these waves correspond to scales in the region 300400  mev .",
    "although the different pwa s show no overall bias in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 waves , this is not the case in the @xmath2 wave .",
    "there , in contrast , all the residual interactions show a significant downward curvature at low energies , even after subtraction of the order-@xmath38 terms .",
    "while this may just reflect the fact this wave is poorly constrained by data ( there are differences between the nijmegen @xcite and vpi @xcite phase shifts for this wave ) a more intriguing possibility is that it could be a signal of a long - ranged isospin - breaking effect .    in this context , it should be noted that the isospin - triplet partial waves , such as @xmath1 and @xmath3 , are fitted to @xmath76 scattering data in the nijmegen pwa s @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath22 results are then obtained by simply replacing the neutral - pion exchange in @xmath76 by the relevant combination of neutral- and charged - pion exchange , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : npope ] ) . in contrast",
    "the isospin - singlet waves , such as @xmath2 , have to be obtained from fitting @xmath22 data .",
    "a single value for the @xmath4 coupling is used in all cases .",
    "the overall downward deviation in our results is consistent with what would be expected if we had taken too high a @xmath4 coupling in the dw analysis of these waves .",
    "a similar pattern is also seen in the @xmath77 wave .",
    "the size of the effect is compatible with what can be deduced from pwa s of @xmath5 , @xmath4 or @xmath78 scattering @xcite , however we would caution that all these effects are comparable to the uncertainties in the pwa s .",
    "other isospin - violating @xmath5 interactions in the framework of chpt have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the longest - ranged of these , and hence the most important at low - energies , are the electromagnetic corrections to ope @xcite , but we find that the effect of subtracting the order-@xmath79 corrections to ope is very small for energies above 80 mev",

    "the energy dependence of the residual interaction is essentially linear up to nearly 300 mev .",
    "the systematic errors in the various pwa s are large in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves , making it hard to draw definite conclusions about the effectiveness of the theory in these cases . nonetheless , the residual scattering in these waves is small after removal of all order-@xmath38 terms .",
    "the momentum scales of the terms in the residual short - range potentials are , with one exception , 300  mev or larger , as expected from the scale appearing the pion - exchange potentials .",
    "the exception is the leading term in the @xmath1 wave .",
    "this term is unnaturally large , corresponding to a scale of about 200 mev . in the energy region up to @xmath64  mev , where ope and tpe forces are expected to dominate , there is no evidence of a breakdown of the chiral expansion , nor is it necessary to introduce any additional regularisation in the spin - singlet channels .    in the isospin - singlet waves we find hints of isospin breaking in the @xmath4 couplings , although these are very much at the limit what can be deduced given the systematic errors in the different pwa s",
    ".    it will be very interesting to see the results of this dw method when it is applied to phase shifts from the newer nijmegen pwa s @xcite .",
    "if these are suffiently well - determined at low - energies , it should be posssible to use the method to examine whether the results after extraction of the order-@xmath40 potential @xcite remain consistent with the chiral expansion .",
