    "a universal profile of dark matter haloes was introduced as a result of high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations performed by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) for power - law as well as cdm initial power spectra of density fluctuations .",
    "nfw found that in a large range of masses the density profiles of dark haloes can be fitted with a simple formula with only one fitting parameter .",
    "the density profile steepens from @xmath4 near the centre of the halo to @xmath5 at large distances .",
    "the nfw profile has been confirmed in cosmological simulations by cole & lacey ( 1996 ) , tormen , bouchet & white ( 1997 ) , huss , jain & steinmetz ( 1999a ) , jing ( 2000 ) , bullock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , while huss , jain & steinmetz ( 1999b ) have shown that the nfw profile also arises from non - cosmological initial conditions .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that some ( but not all ) recent very high resolution cosmological simulations produce steeper density profiles , with inner slopes @xmath6 ( fukushige & makino 1997 , moore et al . 1998 , ghigna et al .",
    "1999 , see also jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "the density profiles in the cosmological simulations also display considerable scatter ( avila - reese et al .",
    "1999 , bullock et al . 1999 ) , and avila - reese et al .",
    "find that the outer slopes of galaxy size haloes are steeper than the nfw slope of @xmath7 when selected within clusters ( @xmath8 ) and slightly shallower within groups ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "although the exact properties of dark matter haloes are still under debate , the nfw profile is presently considered to provide the reference frame for any further numerical research on density profiles of dark haloes .",
    "simple cosmological derivations of the density profiles of bound objects are difficult , essentially because one needs to work in the non - linear regime of the growth of gravitational instabilities . nevertheless , using the spherical top - hat model of gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , density profiles typically varying as @xmath10 were derived by gott ( 1975 ) , gunn ( 1977 ) , fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) and bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) applied the spherical infall model to the hierarchical clustering scenario and predicted that the density profiles of haloes should depend on @xmath11 as well as the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "however , for @xmath12 they obtained power - law profiles in contradiction with the steepening slopes found in the current @xmath0-body simulations described above . in a recent study , okas ( 2000 )",
    "has improved the model of hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) by a generalization of the initial density distribution , the introduction of a cut - off in this distribution at half the inter - peak separation and by a proper calculation of the collapse factor .",
    "the improved model reproduces the changing slope of the density profile and its dependence on halo mass and the type of cosmological power spectrum found by nfw .",
    "the nfw profile is also reproduced in studies taking into account the merging mechanism ( see lacey & cole 1993 ) in the halo formation scenario ( e.g. salvador - sol , solanes & manrique 1998 , avila - reese , firmani & hernandez 1998 ) . therefore the numerical and analytical considerations seem to converge on the statement that the density profiles of dark matter haloes are indeed well described by the universal formula proposed by nfw .    the ultimate test of both the analytical and numerical results must come from the observations of density profiles of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "three recent studies of clusters ( carlberg et al . 1997 , adami et al .",
    "1998 , van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ) claim good agreement between cluster observations and the nfw mass density profile .",
    "but for galaxies , the situation is less satisfying .",
    "flores & primack ( 1994 ) show that the nfw profile is incompatible with the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , while kravtsov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimate that the inner slope of the density profile of dwarf irregular and lsb galaxies is @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "however , these conclusions were obtained with a number of assumptions and approximations concerning the very unclear issues of biasing , non - sphericity of objects and so on .",
    "besides , as pointed out by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , swaters , madore & trewhella ( 2000 ) and van den bosch & swaters ( 2000 ) , the observed rotation curves of these galaxies are too uncertain to discriminate between cores and cusps .    the main motivation for this research is to explore analytically the physical properties of objects with nfw density profiles .",
    "the aim is to check whether these properties are acceptable from the physical point of view and thus to test the validity of density profiles obtained in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "additionally , this paper presents formulae for observable quantities that can be used for comparisons between the theoretical predictions ( such as the nfw profile ) and observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a short presentation of the universal formula for the density profile proposed by nfw , in section  2 we describe physical properties of spherical systems following from this density profile .",
    "section  3 is devoted to a simple comparison between the projected nfw density profile and the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a more thorough comparison is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be given elsewhere ( mamon & okas , in preparation ) .",
    "the discussion follows in section  4 .",
    "nfw established that the density profiles of dark matter haloes in high resolution cosmological simulations for a wide range of masses and for different initial power spectra of density fluctuations are well fitted by the formula @xmath15 with a single fitting parameter @xmath16 , the characteristic density .",
    "the so - called scale radius @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the virial radius usually defined as the distance from the centre of the halo within which the mean density is @xmath20 times the present critical density , @xmath21 . the value of the virial overdensity @xmath20 is often assumed to be @xmath22 , a number predicted by the simplest version of the spherical model for @xmath12 . for other cosmological models it can be lower by a factor of 2 or more ( lacey & cole 1993 , eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) . however , according to the improved spherical infall model ( okas 2000 ) @xmath20 can be as low as 30 even for @xmath12 . in the following , @xmath20",
    "is kept as a free parameter .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 introduced in equation ( [ c2 ] ) is the concentration parameter , which is related to the characteristic density by @xmath24 where @xmath25 the concentration parameter will be used hereafter as the only parameter describing the shape of density profile . from cosmological @xmath0-body simulations ( navarro et al .",

    "the observed trend is for lower concentration parameter in higher mass objects , with @xmath26 in cosmological simulations with cdm initial power spectra and @xmath23 up to 90 for the less realistic scale - free power spectra .",
    "more precisely , in the @xmath27cdm cosmology , @xmath28 corresponds to the masses of clusters of galaxies , while @xmath29 corresponds to the masses of bright galaxies .",
    "it is convenient to express the distance from the centre of the object in units of the virial radius @xmath19 : @xmath30 and the density profile of equation ( [ c1 ] ) then becomes @xmath31    the mass of the halo is usually defined as the mass within the virial radius : @xmath32 the distribution of mass in units of the virial mass follows from equation ( [ c6 ] ) : @xmath33\\ ] ] and we see that it diverges at large @xmath34 , which is a disadvantage of the model from a physical point of view .",

    "in fact such a model with purely radial orbits and nfw density profile is not physical since its distribution function is not everywhere non - negative . as pointed out by e.g. richstone & tremaine ( 1984 , see also okas & hoffman 2000 ) , such velocity anisotropy requires the inner density profile to be @xmath61 or steeper for the model to be physical .    a more realistic description of velocity anisotropy is provided by a model proposed by osipkov ( 1979 ) and merritt ( 1985 ) with @xmath46 dependent on distance from the centre of the object @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the anisotropy radius determining the transition from isotropic orbits inside to radial orbits outside .",

    "however , as demonstrated by figure  [ twc ] , at the virial radius @xmath78 , @xmath79 is still greater than unity and grows with the amount of anisotropy in the model .",
    "we see that the virial theorem is better satisfied at @xmath66 for objects with larger concentration parameters , as @xmath80 .",
    "since objects of smaller mass have larger concentration parameters , they are closer to dynamical equilibrium .    the scalar virial theorem we referred to above is expected to be satisfied for self - gravitating systems in steady state . in more realistic situations ,",
    "the system is never isolated and experiences an external gravitational field ; there is also continuous infall of matter .",
    "we may conclude from the results above that objects with nfw",
    "density profiles and different velocity distributions are close to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , the virial ratio can not be used to define the boundary of the virialized object .",
    "a useful quantity is the half - mass radius .",
    "unfortunately , the divergence of the mass of the nfw profile forces one to define the half - mass radius within a cutoff radius @xmath81 .",
    "the most natural choice is @xmath82 , since the density distribution is only reliable out to the virial radius . with @xmath82 ,",
    "the half - mass radius @xmath83 satisfies the following relation for the mass of dimensionless radius : @xmath84 numerical values of @xmath85 are easily obtained using equation ( [ c8 ] ) and over the range @xmath86 they can be approximated to better than 2% accuracy by @xmath87 the lowest thick solid line in figure  [ rhgamma ] shows how @xmath85 decreases with increasing concentration parameter .",
    "it is useful to estimate the concentration @xmath88 of a dynamical system , such that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass weighted mean - square velocity dispersion .",
    "as first noted by spitzer ( 1969 ) for polytropes , many realistic density profiles have @xmath91 .",
    "for example , it is easy to show that for the hernquist ( 1990 ) model with @xmath45 , @xmath92 ( mamon 2000 ) .",
    "using equation  ( [ gammadef ] ) and limiting again the mass to @xmath93 , we define @xmath88 with @xmath94 where we made use of @xmath95 the values of @xmath88 for different velocity anisotropy models , derived from equations  ( [ c7 ] ) , ( [ c8 ] ) , ( [ c16 ] ) , ( [ c16])-([c17b ] ) , ( [ rhfit ] ) , and ( [ gammadef2 ] ) are shown in figure  [ rhgamma ] and in the case of @xmath45 yield numbers closest to 0.4 : @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "thus the nfw model produces @xmath88s that are higher than the canonical value of 0.4 , especially if more velocity anisotropy is assumed .",
    "this may be caused by the ill - defined cutoff radius .    in models with homogeneous cores , the central density , the core radius @xmath100 and the central 3-d velocity dispersion @xmath101",

    "it grows with @xmath34 from zero at @xmath123 reaching a maximum value of @xmath124 at @xmath125 and decreases to zero again as @xmath52 .",
    "the values of this parameter at the virial radius are @xmath124 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively for @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "a quantity of great dynamical importance is the distribution function . for a spherical system with an isotropic velocity tensor ,",
    "the distribution function depends on the phase - space coordinates only through the energy ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) , and can be derived through the eddington ( 1916 ) formula ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath130 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the conventionally defined relative energy and potential ; here @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the total energy per unit mass and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is given by equation ( [ c9 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that , given equations ( [ c6 ] ) and ( [ c9 ] ) , the second term in brackets in equation  ( [ c26 ] ) is zero . the simplest way to perform the integration of the first term is to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "then the integration variable should be changed to @xmath34 and the limit of integration corresponding to @xmath141 found numerically for each @xmath141 by solving equation @xmath142 . otherwise , with a few percent accuracy , the integration in ( [ c26 ] ) can be done directly with an approximation @xmath143 .",
    "the calculations of the distribution function are usually performed in units such that @xmath144 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , where @xmath145 is the total mass of the system and @xmath146 is its effective radius . since in the case of nfw profile",
    "the total mass is infinite a reasonable choice seems to be to put @xmath147 .",
    "the effective radius is not well defined either but can be approximated as @xmath148 ( see the next section ) .",
    "therefore we choose the units so that @xmath149 and arrive at the numerical results shown in figure  [ df ] .",
    "this choice of normalization is equivalent to measuring @xmath150 in units of @xmath151 and @xmath134 in units of @xmath152 .",
    "figure  [ df ] proves that the distribution function turns out to be similar to the distribution functions obtained from other density profiles ( see e.g. figure 4 - 12 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) , except that the nfw distribution functions do not display the cutoff at nearly unbound energies characteristic of king ( 1966 ) models .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ df ] indicate a proper behaviour of the distribution function ( it is nowhere negative ) .",
    "quantitative comparisons with other models should , however , be made with caution because of the aforementioned problem with normalization .",
    "distribution functions for more realistic velocity dispersion models , like the osipkov - merritt model , were recently considered in detail by widrow ( 2000 ) .      of primary importance for comparisons with observations",
    "are the projected distributions .",

    "comparisons of the surface mass density to surface brightness observations are usually performed with the assumption of constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath182 .",

    "both quantities are normalized to their values at the virial radius .",
    "figure  [ is ] shows that the surface mass density depends weakly on the concentration parameter , especially at larger distances from the centre .",
    "since the surface mass density ( eq . [ [ c20 ] ] ) behaves as @xmath191 at large distances , one may therefore compare it with the hubble - reynolds formula ( reynolds 1913 ) , which was the first model used to describe the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies : @xmath192 @xmath193 is the characteristic radius of the distribution , where the surface brightness falls to one - quarter of its central value .",

    "100= 101=    the lower panel of figure  [ de ] shows how the results depend on the choice of cut - off for @xmath29 and @xmath209 , 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 , and 5 . at first glance",
    ", it seems that the nfw profile is well fitted by the @xmath205 law , especially for @xmath210 .",
    "however , the range of surface mass densities where the fit is excellent is roughly @xmath211 , and the fit is adequate for a range smaller than @xmath212 .",
    "in contrast , the surface brightness profile of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy ngc  3379 ( m  105 ) follows the @xmath205 law in a range of 10 magnitudes ( de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) , i.e. a factor @xmath213 in intensity .    in order to see how good is the de vaucouleurs s fit in this case in both panels of figure  [ de ] we plotted a number of data points equally spaced in @xmath205 . since de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) do not provide the error bars for their data , the error bars shown in the figure were taken from goudfrooij et al .",
    "the excess of the data above the @xmath205 law for small @xmath155 was already noted by de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) .",
    "the error bars are negligible for @xmath214 and smaller than 15% out to @xmath215 , the maximum distance from the centre reached in the data of goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "according to de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) , in this galaxy the @xmath205 surface brightness profile extends to @xmath216 , given a distance of 12.4 mpc to ngc 3379 ( salaris & cassisi 1998 ) .",
    "within @xmath217 , de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) report a blue magnitude , corrected for galactic extinction of @xmath218 , yielding a total blue luminosity of @xmath219 , hence a blue luminosity density of @xmath220 . since the mass within @xmath217 must be greater than the mass in stars",
    ", we infer that within this radius , @xmath221 ( the typical mass to blue luminosity ratio for old stellar populations ) , yielding an overdensity of the galaxy , relative to the critical density @xmath222 of @xmath223 . therefore , since @xmath224 ( the value at @xmath50 )",
    ", we conclude that @xmath225 , hence @xmath226 .",
    "in contrast , with @xmath201 , the effective radius of the nfw model ( @xmath29 ) is @xmath227 ( figure  [ aec ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy in @xmath228 between nfw and @xmath205 law gets even worse if one adopts @xmath229 , which provides the best fits of the nfw surface mass density to the @xmath205 law : indeed , figure  [ aec ] indicates @xmath230 for the nfw model .    in summary",
    ", the nfw surface mass density profile resembles an @xmath205 law in a fairly wide range of radii , but 1 ) one has to resort to an abnormally large effective radius , very close to the virial radius , and assume that the effective radius measures half the projected light ( or mass ) within 4 times the virial radius , and 2 ) the fit is good in a considerably smaller range of radii than is observed in the nearby giant elliptical ngc  3379 .",
    "the generalization of the @xmath205 law into an @xmath1 law , first proposed by srsic ( 1968 ) , is known to fit the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies within a much larger mass range than the de vaucouleurs law ( caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the srsic profile is @xmath231\\ } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath232 is tabulated by ciotti ( 1991 ) , who gives the empirical relation @xmath233 , good to 0.1% relative accuracy .",
    "the de vaucouleurs law is reproduced for @xmath234 , while @xmath235 corresponds to an exponential law as in spiral disks .    in figure  [ sersic10 ]",
    ", we plot the nfw surface brightness @xmath236 , with @xmath203 given by equation  ( [ c20 ] ) and @xmath29 , as a function of @xmath237 for various values of the srsic parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we compare them to the srsic profiles given by the straight dashed lines .",
    "the agreement is good for all values of @xmath3 , within ranges of @xmath238 that increase with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "comparison of the plots for different @xmath3 shows that the srsic models with lower @xmath3 generally agree better with the nfw surface brightness for smaller radii , while those with larger @xmath3 are in better agreement at larger radii , closer to the virial radius .",
    "overall , the nfw profile matches best the @xmath239 srsic law , over a factor of @xmath212 in intensity ( 7.5 magnitudes ) .    for a more quantitative comparison , we performed two - parameter fits of the srsic models ( [ c31 ] ) to the projected nfw formula ( [ c20 ] ) .",
    "the nfw profile was sampled in the range of @xmath240 with a given @xmath23 .",
    "the fitted srsic parameters @xmath241 and @xmath228 obtained for different @xmath23 are shown in figure  [ fitser ] .",
    "figure  [ nfwser ] compares the two projected profiles for @xmath29 .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the srsic model in this case are @xmath242 and @xmath243 .    while caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) find similar ranges of agreement between observed profiles and srsic laws , this range in intensity is still smaller than the range of @xmath213 found for ngc  3379 by de vaucouleurs & capaccioli ( 1979 ) .",
    "moreover , while caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) find that the best fitting srsic models for elliptical galaxies have indices spanning a wide range , from @xmath244 for faint ellipticals to @xmath245 for bright ellipticals , the srsic laws that match the nfw models span a much smaller range , roughly @xmath246 ( @xmath247 for @xmath248 , see figure  [ fitser ] ) .",
    "moreover , the problem of very high values of @xmath228 ( @xmath249 for @xmath248 , see figure  [ fitser ] ) , remains in the fits of srsic profiles to projected nfw models .",
    "the main disadvantage of the nfw model is the logarithmic divergence of its mass ( and luminosity for constant mass - to - light ratio ) . in contrast , the jaffe ( 1983 ) and hernquist ( 1990 ) models converge in mass , and their properties can be expressed in units of their asymptotic mass . for the nfw model , one",
    "is restricted to a mass at a physical radius such as the virial radius .",
    "this mass divergence also complicates the analysis of surface brightness profiles , which involve the effective radius where the aperture luminosity is half its asymptotic value .",
    "however , independently of the radial cut - off introduced to define the effective radius , the projected nfw density profile is consistent with constant mass - to - light ratio , given the observed srsic profiles of elliptical galaxies , but only in a limited range of radii , with unusually high values of @xmath146 and in a smaller interval of srsic shape parameters than observed . on the other hand , the hernquist ( 1990 ) model ,",
    "whose density profile scales as @xmath250 at large radii , produces better fits to the @xmath205 law .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ de ] suggests that , for reasonable effective radii , if indeed dark matter follows the nfw profile , the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath185 , is not constant but increases with radius , not only in the outer regions , as is inferred from the commonly accepted picture of galaxies embedded in more spatially extended dark haloes , but also in the inner regions .",
    "this is at odds with the observed kinematics of ellipticals that bertola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) inferred from observations of ionised and neutral gas around specific ellipticals .",
    "moreover , increasing @xmath185 throughout the galaxy implies radial velocity anisotropy throughout elliptical galaxies , whereas violent relaxation should cause isotropic cores .",
    "for some elliptical galaxies .",
    "] thus it appears difficult to reconcile the photometry and kinematics of elliptical galaxies with nfw models . in a forthcoming paper ( mamon & okas , in preparation )",
    ", we will omit the assumption of mass follows light in a more detailed assessment of the compatibility of the observations of elliptical galaxies with the nfw model .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be directly applied to the analysis of the mass and light distribution in clusters of galaxies . a standard procedure to do it is to measure the surface brightness and the light - of - sight velocity dispersion and assuming some form of velocity distribution or mass - to - light ratio calculate the luminosity density and the velocity dispersion by solving the abel integral equations ( [ c20 ] ) and ( [ c24 ] ) and the jeans equation ( binney & mamon 1982 , tonry 1983 , solanes & salvador - sol 1990 , dejonghe & merritt 1992 ) .",
    "the results of this procedure are uncertain because it involves derivatives of observed quantities which are usually noisy .",
    "one also experiences a degeneracy because different models fit the data equally well ( merritt 1987 ) . instead of solving the abel equations one can also model the luminosity density and velocity dispersion with simple functions and",
    "fit their parameters so that they reproduce their projected counterparts ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "our results are useful for the simpler approach of assuming realistic forms of the density distribution , velocity distribution and mass - to - light ratio . here",
    "we provide the tools for modelling the nfw density profile with different velocity distributions and constant mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath251 ) , and obtain exact predictions for the surface brightness and the line - of - sight as well as aperture velocity dispersion that can be directly compared to observations .",
