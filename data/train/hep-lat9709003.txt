    "in recent papers we have discussed various analytical and numerical aspects of an economical way of describing spin models living on `` thin '' ( i.e. generic , non - planar ) random graphs @xcite . in particular , one finds mean - field like behaviour for the spin models due to the locally - tree - like structure of the graphs .",
    "this approach is based on the simple observation @xcite that the thin graphs appear as the feynman diagrams in the perturbative expansion of matrix models when the @xmath3 ( scalar ) limit is taken .",
    "an alternative @xmath2 limit is perhaps more familiar for matrix models in the context of two - dimensional gravity , where the resulting `` fat '' graphs are of interest because of their relation to surfaces and string worldsheets .",
    "this relation is lost in the thin graph case but the models still merit attention , both from the point of view of investigating various decorated random graphs and as a way of accessing mean field behaviour without infinite range interactions or the boundary problems of genuine trees like the bethe lattice .",
    "the thin graph models are amenable to a saddle point solution , using large order / instanton methods from path integrals @xcite for the ordinary integrals which appear in this case .",
    "such saddle point methods in graph theory been independently derived from a probabilistic viewpoint by whittle in @xcite .",
    "the topic of the current paper has also been presaged by the same author in @xcite , where the main concern was understanding the statistics of random directed graphs using complex integrals rather than the real integrals of @xcite .",
    "we take a rather different tack here , where our aim is to investigate vertex models on random graphs in their own right , so the focus is on the matter living on the graphs rather than the graphs themselves .    in diagrammatic terms",
    "the effect of going from a hermitian to a complex matrix model is to place arrows on the edges of the graphs that appear in the perturbative expansion , giving a directed graph .",
    "we take @xmath4 to be the `` head '' of the arrow by convention .",
    "this is true whatever the value of @xmath5 so it still holds , in particular , for the @xmath3 limit .",
    "we can pick out the @xmath6th order in the perturbative expansion by carrying out a contour integral in the coupling constant in an exactly analogous manner to the path integral calculations in @xcite .",
    "the general form of the partition function we are interested in for a vertex model on an ensemble of thin random graphs with @xmath6 vertices is thus @xmath7 , \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is complex , @xmath4 is its conjugate , @xmath9 is the potential that specifies the particular vertex model , @xmath10 is the overall vertex coupling that will invariably be scaled out in the ensuing discussion and @xmath11 is the set of remaining couplings that can be tuned to search for critical behaviour .",
    "the prefactor @xmath12 counts the number of undecorated graphs in the class of graphs of interest and will generically grow factorially with the number of vertices . for @xmath13 ( 3-regular ) random graphs , for instance , it is given by @xmath14    it is well known that complex matrix models with potentials of the form @xmath15 generate `` chequered '' surfaces in the @xmath2 limit , where all the loops have an even number of edges @xcite . in this case",
    "the critical behaviour turns out to be identical to that of a hermitian model , as restricting oneself to combinations of @xmath16 effectively gives a hermitian model in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "something similar occurs in the thin @xmath3 limit , as was noted already in @xcite . when one considers models where the in - degree ( number of arrows in ) and out - degree ( number of arrows out ) at each vertex is the same , as would be the case for potentials of the form @xmath15 the saddle point equations are singular in the original variables due to the radial degree of freedom .",
    "switching to polar co - ordinates eliminates the singularity and one recovers the critical behaviour of the equivalent real integrals .",
    "the natural symmetry to preserve in the vertex models is arrow reversal , or complex conjugation . in the integral for the partition function in equ.([e1 ] ) this corresponds to demanding a real integrand .",
    "we now note that we are not obliged to restrict ourselves to potentials composed only of combinations of @xmath16 to maintain this symmetry , which allows us to look at a more general class of potentials and observe a much richer critical behaviour than that seen for @xmath15 .",
    "we shall see in the sequel that the resulting models play a similar role to the eight - vertex model on a square lattice in that they contain many other soluble models as special cases .    in the next two sections of the paper we discuss models on thin @xmath13 and @xmath18 graphs separately . in all cases",
    "we shall convert our models back to a real notation by making the substitution @xmath19 ( @xmath20 real ) , as well as pre - emptively scaling out the overall vertex coupling @xmath10 in the actions we discuss . as it is the critical behaviour of the matter that is of interest , which is determined by the saddle point equations for the `` fields '' ( @xmath21 )",
    ", we shall concentrate exclusively on them , omitting the trivial saddle point in @xmath10 .",
    "we then move on to discuss vertex models on _ planar _ graphs ( i.e. the @xmath2 limit ) , where the resulting matrix models are not soluble in general , highlighting some cases where solutions are available by mapping onto previously solved models .",
    "on @xmath13 graphs we can have vertices with 3 inward or 3 outward pointing arrows , 2 arrows in and 1 out , or 2 arrows out and one in as shown in fig.1 . these correspond to terms of the form @xmath22 , @xmath13 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively in @xmath25 .",
    "we can construct four possible linear combinations of these that are invariant under the complex conjugation symmetry , namely @xmath26 , \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   i \\left[(\\phi^3 - ( \\phi^{\\dagger})^3 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & { } & \\left[(\\phi^{\\dagger})^2 \\phi + \\phi^2 ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) \\right ] , \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; i \\left[(\\phi^{\\dagger})^2 \\phi - \\phi^2 ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the most general invariant action @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) one can write down is @xmath29 - i { \\beta \\over 3 } \\left[(\\phi^3 - ( \\phi^{\\dagger})^3 \\right ]   -   \\gamma \\left[(\\phi^{\\dagger})^2 \\phi + \\phi^2 ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) \\right ] - i \\delta \\left[(\\phi^{\\dagger})^2 \\phi - \\phi^2 ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) \\right ] \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , grouping together the similar vertices @xmath30 - ( \\gamma- i \\delta ) \\left [ \\phi^2 ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) \\right ] \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{ecomp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus see it is natural to have the @xmath31 and @xmath32 vertices appearing with complex ( but conjugate ) weights .",
    "we can cast this action in real form by writing @xmath19 , with @xmath33 , @xmath34 real which gives @xmath35 this transformation is rather reminiscent of the line decomposition that is used for vertex models on regular lattices @xcite , with @xmath33 being black and @xmath34 white lines , but we do not have line conservation at each vertex for the @xmath13 model .",
    "the saddle point equations @xmath36 for this action are explicitly soluble for general values of the couplings , but the solutions are not terribly illuminating for the purposes of extracting different critical behaviours when written down baldly .",
    "we can get a little more insight by reducing various subsets of the coupling constant space to already known models .",
    "one obvious reduction is to set @xmath37 which removes the terms antisymmetric in @xmath38 in the action .",
    "this leaves one with @xmath39 which displays mean - field ising critical behaviour on a suitable coupling constant locus .",
    "this can be seen by considering the standard action for the ising model on @xmath13 graphs @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 ) whose feynman diagram expansion represents ising spins with hamiltonian @xmath42 living on the graphs , where the spin interactions are along nearest neighbour @xmath43 edges .",
    "if we carry out the linear transformation @xmath44 and some judicious rescalings we obtain @xmath45 , \\label{ising2}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , which is identical ( up to a rescaling ) with equ.([ising1 ] ) , provided we identify @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    the ising model on @xmath13 graphs described by the action in equ.([ephi3 ] ) displays a mean field transition at @xmath49 , so the model in equ.([ising2 ] ) would be expected to display a transition at the `` dual '' value of @xmath50 . a direct solution of the saddle point equations for equ.([ising2 ] )",
    "@xmath51 where the @xmath52 is the temperature associated with the dual coupling , @xmath53 , reveals that this is indeed the case .",
    "it is worth remarking that the action of equ.([ising1 ] , [ ising2 ] ) on planar graphs ( i.e. in the @xmath2 limit ) corresponds to an ising model with spins situated at the vertices of a random triangulation dual to the original @xmath13 graph @xcite .",
    "the notion of duality is not defined for the non - planar graphs of the @xmath3 limit but one could think of action representing spins residing on the vertices of the triangles in the cactus ( or husimi tree ) diagram in fig.2 interacting with their nearest neighbours .",
    "this cactus graph is the medial graph of the underlying @xmath13 graph which is also indicated in the figure . unlike standard cacti , the branches of triangles eventually close to form large loops , since the underlying @xmath13 graphs are closed . for",
    "an alternative physical interpretation one could consider the @xmath13 graphs themselves and think of the model as a gas of @xmath34 loops in an @xmath33 `` sea '' , which is the @xmath54 loop gas representation of the ising model .",
    "viewed as ising spins on a cactus graph the action of equ.([ising1 ] , [ ising2 ] ) restricts triangles to have all spins up ( @xmath55 vertices ) or two spins down and one up ( @xmath56 vertices ) .",
    "this restriction does not appear in the planar case as one can then think of @xmath33 representing a `` same - spin '' edge and @xmath34 a `` different - spin '' edge , which is sufficient to cover all configurations when the triangles are pasted together along their edges .",
    "the difference on the thin graphs is that the triangles are to be thought of as being joined at their vertices .",
    "lifting the constraint is equivalent to allowing non - zero @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the original vertex model and we obtain actions that describe multi - spin interaction models on cacti .",
    "the spin hamiltonian for such a model is given by @xmath59 where the three spin sum is over triangles @xmath60 .",
    "with all four possible spin configurations on the triangles of the husimi tree now allowed , namely @xmath61 , the action can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "this is clearly equivalent to equ.([ereal ] ) once one rescales @xmath65 and makes the identifications @xmath66 which gives two conditions on our original four vertex model couplings to match the number of physical parameters .",
    "note that it is natural to include the external field @xmath67 from the start in such models as the phase transition generically appears in non - zero field for such multi - site interaction models @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of equ.([multi1 ] ) may be extended to include nearest neighbour interactions as well @xmath68 and a similar reasoning to the pure 3-spin interaction case above leads to the action @xmath69 where the additional parameter @xmath70 .",
    "once again a rescaling @xmath65 and absorbing the overall factor of @xmath71 in the vertex coupling gives an action of the form equ.([ereal ] ) .",
    "we can also see that sending @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) picks out the two sorts of vertex / triangle allowed in the ising model discussed above .",
    "from the loop gas point of view both equ.([multia1],[multia2 ] ) represent a gas of @xmath34 loops and lines in an @xmath33 sea , which can now interact via @xmath74 terms and break via @xmath75 terms .",
    "alternatively the roles of @xmath34 ( loops / lines ) and @xmath33 ( sea ) may be exchanged as their vertices appear in a similar form in the action .",
    "it is also possible to bring potts models under the umbrella of the vertex model framework in one of two possible ways .",
    "the original @xmath76-state potts model action contains @xmath76 ( real ) variables @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is now @xmath80 , and represents the following hamiltonian on @xmath13 graphs @xmath81 where the spins @xmath82 take on @xmath76 values and @xmath57 is a kronecker delta .",
    "it is possible to write an `` effective '' action coming from imposing the observed symmetry breaking pattern @xmath83 from the saddle point equation solutions on the original @xmath76 variable action @xcite .",
    "this effective action @xmath84",
    "x^2   - { 1 \\over 3 } ( q -1 ) x^3 + { 1 \\over 2 } y^2   - { 1 \\over 3 } y^3 - c ( q -1 ) x y \\label{app1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] faithfully reproduces the correct saddle point solutions .",
    "one can carry now out some rescalings on equ.([app1 ] ) along with the ubiquitous linear transformation @xmath85 , @xmath86 to obtain @xmath87 \\label{ereal2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 which is yet another variant of the action in equ.([ereal ] ) for a particular choice of couplings .",
    "it is noteworthy that the first order transition point for the @xmath76-state potts model that was derived in @xcite @xmath89 is the point at which @xmath90 , reducing equ.([ereal2 ] ) to an ising - like action .    a second possibility is to include two further quadratic terms in the allowed action @xmath91   & = & x^2 - y^2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{i}{2 } [ \\phi^2 - ( \\phi^{\\dagger } ) ^2 ]   & = & - 2 x y .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are best thought of as addition bivalent vertices from the point of view of maintaining a vertex model interpretation .",
    "these allow two arrow heads or tails to meet . with these additional vertices",

    "has been shown to contain as special cases ising and multi - spin interaction models , results which are easiest to see once the model has been rewritten in the real form of equ.([ereal ] ) .",
    "written is this form the vertex models can be re - interpreted as representing various systems , including spins on cacti or loop / line gases on the original @xmath13 graphs .",
    "potts models may also be incorporated into the general framework , either by reconstructing the effective potts model action by rescaling and linear transformations from equ.([ereal ] ) , or by introducing further quadratic vertices as in equ.([epotts ] ) .",
