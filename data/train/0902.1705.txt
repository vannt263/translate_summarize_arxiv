    "[ sec : introduction ] the rapid neutron - capture process ( r - process )  @xcite remains as one of the most exciting and challenging questions in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "in particular , the theoretical quest to explain the production of r - process isotopes and the astrophysical scenario where this process occurs have not yet been satisfactorily solved ( for a general review see , for instance , ref .",
    "r - process abundance distributions are typically deduced by subtracting the calculated s- and p - process contributions from the observed solar system abundances . furthermore , elemental abundances originated in the early galaxy can be directly observed in metal - poor , r - process - enriched stars ( mpres ) ( i.e. , @xmath9$]@xmath10@xmath11 , @xmath12$]@xmath10@xmath13 , @xmath14$]@xmath15@xmath16 ) .",
    "these combined observations reveal disparate behavior for light and heavy nuclei : mpres abundance - patterns are nearly consistent from star to star and with the relative solar system r - process abundances for the heavier neutron - capture elements @xmath17@xmath15130 ( ba and above ) , suggesting a rather robust main r - process operating over the history of the galaxy .",
    "such a consistent picture is not seen for light neutron - capture elements in the range 39@xmath18@xmath19@xmath1850 , as the solar system eu - normalized elemental abundances in mpres show a scattered pattern  @xcite .",
    "anti - correlation trends between elemental abundances and eu richness at different metalicities have been suggested to provide a hint for an additional source of isotopes below @xmath17@xmath20130  @xcite .",
    "measured abundances of @xmath21pd and @xmath22i , for @xmath17@xmath23130 , and @xmath24hf , for @xmath17@xmath25130 , trapped in meteorites in the early solar system formation  @xcite , further reinforce the idea of different origins for isotopes lighter and heavier than @xmath17@xmath26130 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "reliable nuclear physics properties for the extremely neutron - rich nuclei along the r - process path are needed to interpret the observational data in the framework of proposed astrophysical models .",
    "the r - process abundance region around @xmath17@xmath20110 , prior to the @xmath17@xmath26130 peak , is one region of intense interest , where the astrophysical models underestimate the abundances by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "it has been shown that the underproduction of abundances can be largely corrected under the assumption of a reduction of the @xmath27@xmath2682 shell gap far from stability  @xcite . whereas such quenching effect was suggested in elements near sn  via analysis of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath28cd into @xmath28 in  @xcite  its extension towards lighter isotones @xmath29ag@xmath30 , @xmath31pd@xmath30 and below would have crucial consequences in the search for the r - process site . in this sense ,",
    "self - consistent mean - field model calculations predict that the @xmath27@xmath2682 shell quenching might be associated with the emergence of a harmonic - oscillator - like doubly semi - magic nucleus @xmath32zr@xmath33 , arising from the weakening of the energy potential surface due to neutron skins  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is imperative to characterize the evolution of nuclear shapes in the region of @xmath34zr .",
    "the goal of the experiment reported here was to use measured @xmath0-decay properties of nuclei in the neighborhood of @xmath34zr to investigate its possible spherical character arising from new semi - magic numbers  @xcite , or even a more exotic tetrahedral - symmetry type predicted by some authors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the measured half - lives ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities ( @xmath36 ) can be used as first probes of the structure of the @xmath0-decay daughter nuclei in this mass region , where more detailed spectroscopy is prohibitive owing to the low production rates at present radioactive beam facilities .",
    "a similar approach has already been used in the past  @xcite . besides the nuclear - structure interest",
    ", our measurements also serve as important direct inputs in r - process model calculations . the @xmath35 values of r - process waiting - point nuclei determine the pre freeze - out isotopic abundances and the speed of the process towards heavier elements .",
    "the @xmath36 values of r - process isobaric nuclei define the decay path towards stability during freeze - out , and provide a source of late - time neutrons .    in the present paper ,",
    "the measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 of @xmath37y , @xmath7zr , @xmath38nb , @xmath39mo and @xmath40tc are reported .",
    "the work is contextualized amid a series of @xmath0-decay r - process experimental campaigns , carried out at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university ( msu ) .",
    "details of the experiment setup and measurement techniques are provided in sec .",

    "the paper is closed with the presentation of the main conclusions and future plans motivated by the current measurements .",
    "neutron - rich y , zr , nb , mo and tc isotopes were produced by fragmentation of a 120 mev / u @xmath41xe beam in a 1242  mg/@xmath42 be target .",
    "the primary beam was produced at the nscl coupled cyclotrons  @xcite at an average intensity of 1.5  pna ( @xmath431@xmath4410@xmath45  s@xmath46 ) .",
    "forward - emitted fragmentation reaction products were separated in - flight with the a1900 fragment separator  @xcite  operated in its achromatic mode  using the @xmath47-@xmath48-@xmath47 technique  @xcite .",
    "two plastic scintillators located at the intermediate ( dispersive ) focal plane and at the experimental area were used to measure the time - of - flight ( @xmath49 ) , related to the velocity of the transmitted nuclei .",
    "the first of these scintillators provided also the transversal positions @xmath50 of the transmitted nuclei at the dispersive plane .",
    "a kapton wedge was mounted behind this detector to keep the achromatism of the a1900 .",
    "energy - losses experienced by nuclei passing through this degrader system of 22.51  mg/@xmath42 ( kapton ) and 22.22  mg/@xmath42 ( bc400 ) thickness , provided a further filter to select a narrower group of elements . a total of 29 neutron - rich isotopes ( @xmath37y , @xmath51zr , @xmath52nb , @xmath53mo and @xmath40tc ) defined the cocktail beam that was transmitted to the implantation station .    the trajectory followed by the nuclei at the a1900 dispersive focal plane depended on their magnetic rigidities @xmath47 , which , in turn , were related to the corresponding velocities and mass - over - charge ratios .",
    "an event - by - event separation of the transmitted nuclei according to their mass @xmath17 and proton @xmath19 numbers was achieved by combining the measured @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the energy - loss @xmath48 in a silicon pin detector located in the implantation station .",
    "the latter quantity had to be corrected from its velocity dependence ( described by the bethe - bloch equation  @xcite ) ; the identification of nuclei transmitted through the a1900 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] . in this figure",
    ", the variable @xmath54 corresponds to the @xmath49 corrected from its @xmath50 dependence , and the @xmath48 signal was measured with the most upstream pin detector of the implantation station .",
    "the maximum 5@xmath55 @xmath47 acceptance of the a1900 included the nuclei of interest , along with three primary - beam charge - states @xmath41xe@xmath56 ( @xmath47@xmath263.8251  tm ) , @xmath41xe@xmath57 ( @xmath47@xmath263.9016  tm ) and @xmath41xe@xmath58 ( @xmath47@xmath263.9812  tm ) , with particle rates of 8.7@xmath4410@xmath59  s@xmath46 , 3.5@xmath4410@xmath60  s@xmath46 and @xmath61  s@xmath46 , respectively . as these contaminants could reach the intermediate image plane , resulting in the damage of the plastic scintillator , it was necessary to stop them with the standard a1900 slits and a 17.4  mm - wide tungsten finger located in the first image plane .",
    "this slit configuration blocked the most intense contaminants with a minor reduction of the @xmath47 acceptance of the fragments of interest .",
    "thus , the @xmath41xe@xmath57 charge - state was blocked by the finger at the central position of the transversal plane , while @xmath41xe@xmath56 stopped in one of the slits , closed at 39.88  mm from the optical axis ( in the low-@xmath47 side ) .",
    "the high-@xmath47 slit was fully opened so that the fragment of interest ( along with the low - intensity contaminant @xmath41xe@xmath58 ) were transmitted through the second half of the a1900 .",
    "the resulting overall @xmath47 acceptance was about 4@xmath55 .",
    "nuclei transmitted through the a1900 and beam transport system were implanted in the nscl beta counting system ( bcs )  @xcite for subsequent analysis .",
    "the bcs consisted of a stack of four silicon pin detectors ( pin14 ) of total thickness 2569  @xmath62 m , used to measure the energy - loss of the exotic species , followed by a 979  @xmath62m - thick 40@xmath4440-pixel double - sided silicon strip detector ( dssd ) wherein implanted nuclei were measured along with their subsequent position - correlated @xmath0 decays . located 9  mm downstream of the dssd ,",
    "a 988  @xmath62m - thick 16-strip single sided si detector ( sssd ) and a 10  mm - thick ge crystal , separated 2  mm from each other , were used to veto particles whose energy - loss in the dssd was similar to that left by @xmath0 decays .",
    "the signals from each dssd and sssd strip were processed by preamplifiers with high- and low - gain outputs , each defined over a scale - range equivalent to 100  mev and 3  gev , respectively .",
    "energy thresholds for the low - gain signals were set to values around 300  mev .",
    "high - gain signals from every dssd and sssd strips were energy - matched in the beginning of the experiment using a @xmath63th @xmath64-source as reference , whereas independent threshold were adjusted using a @xmath65sr @xmath0-source .",
    "two of the dssd strips ( the front - side 31@xmath66 and the back - side @xmath67 ) were damaged and had consequently to be disabled during the experiment , raising their high / low - gain thresholds to maximum values .",
    "energy thresholds for the pin detector were set to 2000  mev for the first detector and around 300  mev for the rest of pin detectors .",
    "a dedicated un - wedged setting of the a1900 , transmitting a large amount of light fragments , was used in the beginning of the experiment to energy - calibrate the pin detectors and low - gain signals from dssd .",
    "the measured energy losses were compared with calculations performed with the lise program  @xcite , using the ziegler energy - loss formulation  @xcite .",
    "the bcs was surrounded by the neutron emission ratio observer ( nero ) detector  @xcite , which was used to measure @xmath0-delayed neutrons in coincidence with the @xmath0-decay precursor .",
    "this detector consisted of sixty ( 16 @xmath68he and 44 b@xmath69f ) proportional gas - counter tubes , embedded in a 60@xmath4460@xmath4480  cm@xmath68 polyethylene moderator matrix .",
    "the detectors were set parallel to the beam direction and arranged in three concentric rings around a 22.4  cm - diameter vacuum beam line that accommodated the bcs .",
    "@xmath0-delayed neutrons were thermalized in the polyethylene moderator to maximize the neuron capture cross section in the @xmath68he and b@xmath69f gas counters .",
    "gains and thresholds of the neutron counters were adjusted using a @xmath71cf post - fission neutron source .",
    "the master - event trigger was provided by the pin1 detector or by a coincidence between the dssd front and back high - gain outputs .",
    "the master trigger opened a 200  @xmath62s - time window  @xcite , during which signals from the nero counters were recorded by an 80  ms - range multi - hit tdc .",
    "the 200  @xmath62s interval was chosen on the basis of an average moderation time of about 150  @xmath62s , measured for neutrons emitted from a @xmath71cf source .",
    "energy signals of moderated neutrons were also collected in an adc .",
    "the closure of the time window was followed by the readout of the bcs and nero electronics .",
    "the particle identification ( pid ) was performed with a dedicated setup installed upstream of the bcs / nero end station .",
    "several nuclei having @xmath62s isomers with known @xmath72-decay transitions were selected in a specific a1900 setting , and implanted in a 4  mm - thick aluminum foil , surrounded by three @xmath72-ray detectors from the msu segmented germanium array ( sega )  @xcite .",
    "these detectors were energy and efficiency calibrated using sources of @xmath73co , @xmath74co and @xmath75eu .",
    "the @xmath72-peak efficiency was about 6@xmath55 at 1  mev .",
    "a 50@xmath4450  mm@xmath76 , 503  @xmath62m - thick silicon pin detector ( pin0 ) upstream of the aluminium foil was used to measure @xmath48 , which , combined with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , allowed for an identification of the various nuclei transmitted in the setting according to their @xmath19 and @xmath17 numbers .",
    "the measurement of these three signals , gated in specific known isomeric @xmath72-decay lines , provided a filter to identify the corresponding @xmath62s isomers .",
    "four settings of the a1900 were used to identify the nuclei of interest in a stepwise fashion based on the observation of the @xmath62s isomers . in each of these settings ,",
    "the first half of the a1900 was tuned to @xmath47=3.9016  tm  defined by the rigidities of the nuclei of interest  while the second half was tuned to @xmath47=3.7881  tm , @xmath47=3.7929  tm , @xmath47=3.7976  tm and @xmath47=3.8024  tm .",
    "the four values were chosen to have fragments transmitted in two consecutive settings , and far enough to cover the entire range of rigidities of interest . in the first setting @xmath47=3.7881  tm , several @xmath72 lines were seen for the @xmath62s - isomeric states of @xmath77pd ( 135  kev ) , @xmath78ag ( 714  kev ) , @xmath79ag ( 156  kev ) , @xmath80ag ( 684  kev ) and @xmath80cd ( 720  kev and 743  kev )  @xcite . from these references , it was possible to identify the more exotic nuclei present in the subsequent settings .",
    "the particle identification was further confirmed by detecting the 135  kev @xmath72 line from the isomer @xmath77pd transmitted in the settings @xmath47=3.7929  tm and @xmath47=3.7976  tm .",
    "the fourth setting @xmath47=3.8024  tm was chosen to optimize the transmission of the nuclei of interest to the final end station .",
    "after the pid was completed , the al catcher and pin0 detector were retracted .",
    "the cocktail beam was then transmitted to the final bcs / nero end station , where the @xmath48 necessary for the pid spectrum was provided by the pin1 detector .        the pid spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] includes the fully - stripped ions of the nuclei of interest , overlapped with a small fraction of charge - states contaminants from lighter isotopes .",
    "given the high @xmath47 selected in the a1900 setting , only the hydrogen - like ions with mass numbers @xmath81 and @xmath82 reached the experimental area .",
    "these contaminants were disentangled from the fully - stripped nuclei by measuring the total kinetic energy ( @xmath83 ) of the transmitted ions compiled from signals of the pin detectors and dssd .",
    "the @xmath83 spectra of different zr isotopes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tke ] : the upper row of panels corresponds to the nuclei that were detected with the first pin detector of the bcs .",
    "the double - peak structure in the @xmath83 spectra arises from the fully - stripped species ( high-@xmath83 peak ) and the corresponding hydrogen - like contaminants ( low-@xmath83 peak ) .",
    "the central and lower row of panels show the same spectra with the additional requirement of being implanted in either the most downstream pin detector in the stack ( i.e. , pin4 ) ( central row ) or in the dssd ( lower row ) .",
    "nearly only the fully - stripped nuclei reached the latter , whereas the hydrogen - like components were mainly implanted in the last pin .",
    "a small fraction of the fully - stripped components did not reach the dssd due to a slightly overestimated si thickness .",
    "furthermore , no low - gain signals from the sssd were observed , demonstrating that no nuclei reached this detector .",
    "specific conditions in the different detectors of the bcs were required to distinguish implantations , decays and light - particle events : a signal registered in each of the four pin detectors , in coincidence with the low - gain output from at least one strip on each side of the dssd , and in anti - coincidence with the sssd , was identified as an implantation event .",
    "decay events were defined as high - gain output signals from at least one strip on each side of the dssd , in anti - coincidence with signals from pin1 .",
    "software thresholds were set separately for each dssd strip in order to cut off noise .",
    "decay - like events accompanied by a preamplifier overflow signal from the ge crystal downstream of the dssd were identified as light particles and consequently rejected . according to lise - based calculations ,",
    "these light particles were mainly tritium nuclei and , to a lesser degree , @xmath84li nuclei , with energy - loss signals in the dssd high - gain output comparable to the decays of interest .    for each implantation event",
    ", the strip location on each side of the dssd  defining the implanted pixel  was determined from the average of the strips weighted by their respective energy signal amplitude .",
    "the resulting average pixel was recorded along with the implantation time taken from a continuously counting 50  mhz clock .",
    "the last beam - line quadrupoles in front of the bcs were adjusted to illuminate a wide area of the dssd cross - section ; the resulting distribution of implantation events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : impdssd ] .",
    "subsequent decay events occurring in the same or neighboring pixels ( defining a cluster of nine pixels ) within a give correlation - time window ( @xmath85 ) were associated with the previous implantation , and their times and pixels recorded .",
    "the value of @xmath85 was chosen to be around 10 times the expected @xmath35 . whenever a decay - like event was correlated with more than one implantation",
    ", all the events within the sequence ( i.e. , decay and implantations ) were rejected .",
    "such scenario would be possible if different implantations occur in the same cluster within the correlation - time window .",
    "given the low maximum implantation rate per pixel of about 1.8@xmath4410@xmath86  @xmath87 and the @xmath35 values ( typically below 1  s ) , the probability of multiple implantation events correlated with a decay was negligible .",
    "back strip and 31@xmath66 front strip in the dssd can be observed as respective gaps on the top - plane projection.,width=264 ]      the implantation - decay correlation criterion did not prevent the occurrence of spurious correlations arising from sources other than the actual decays of interest .",
    "possible background sources included : light particles that did not lead to overflows in the ge detector ( either because they missed the detector or because they deposited only a fraction of their energy ) ; real decays from longer - lived implanted nuclei and from nuclei implanted in neighboring pixels ; and electronic noise signals above the thresholds .",
    "a detailed study of this decay - like background was necessary to extract @xmath35 values .",
    "background rates were determined separately for each dssd cluster and 1-hour data - collection run , counting the number of decay - like events that were not correlated with any implantation . during this background measurement , each time an implantation was detected in a given pixel , the corresponding 9-pixel cluster was blocked to any subsequent decay event during a time interval chosen to be longer than @xmath85 . decay - like events detected in that cluster after the closure of the post - implantation blocking time ( i.e. , those that were not correlated with the previous implantation ) were recorded as background events .",
    "background rates were calculated for each 1-hour run as the ratio of the number of uncorrelated decay events in each cluster to the unblocked time in that cluster .",
    "the resulting rates were position - dependent and nearly constant over different runs . a critical factor in this analysis was the length of the post - implantation blocking time which had to be chosen so as to minimize the probability of recording real correlated decays .",
    "a blocking - time window of 40  s was found to fulfill this requirement . finally , the dssd cluster - averaged @xmath0-decay background was about 0.01  s@xmath46 , nearly constant throughout the experiment .",
    "the total number of @xmath0-decay background events @xmath88 for each isotope was calculated from the measured background rates in the runs and pixels where the isotopes were implanted , multiplied by @xmath85 .",
    "this number was divided by the total unblocked time , calculated as the product of the number of implantations and @xmath85 , giving the background rate for that nucleus .",
    "the statistical error for the background rate of each nucleus , derived from the number of background events recorded in each dssd cluster and run , was about 5@xmath55 .",
    "the time differences between implantation and correlated decay events were accumulated for each nucleus in separated histograms and fitted by least - squares to a multi - parameter function derived from the batemann equations  @xcite .",
    "due to the limited detection efficiency of the dssd , some of the recorded @xmath0-decay events may come from descendant nuclei following a missed decay of the nuclei of interest .",
    "given the low probability of missing consecutive decays , the correlation times used in the analysis , and the values of the half - lives of the descendant nuclei , up to three generations were included in the fit functions , along with contributions from background events .",
    "the paths that define the possible decay sequences following the decay of a mother nucleus are schematically illustrated in fig .  [ fig : decscheme ] .",
    "the fit equation included a total of eleven parameters , eight of them fixed to constant values , namely : the decay constants of the daughter ( @xmath89 ) and granddaughter ( @xmath90 ) ; the neutron - emission probability of the mother ( @xmath91 ) , daughter ( @xmath92 ) , and neutron - emitted daughter ( @xmath93 ) ; and the decay constants of the single neutron - emitted daughter ( @xmath94 ) and granddaughter ( @xmath95 ) , and the double neutron - emitted granddaughter ( @xmath96 ) .",
