    "to prove the injectivity of @xmath195 comes down to proving that `` erasing the arrows '' in a configuration @xmath192 is an injective operation . by lemma  [ lem : noloops ] , this is indeed the case : orienting all bottom paths and left - right paths paths in @xmath193 from left to right gives back @xmath192 .",

    "if @xmath90 avoids consecutive left edges and even vertical edges , then the fillings of the unit triangles belong to one of the ten possibilities of figure  [ fig : rulesoriented ] , and the boundary words of @xmath90 correspond to the labels from the same figure .",
    "therefore , there exists a puzzle @xmath211 such that @xmath212 .",
    "but such puzzles exist only if @xmath213 by theorem  [ th : ktlr ] , which completes the proof .",
    "the preceding proposition thus gives a nice characterization of tfpls .",
    "however the proof of this result is slightly unsatisfying from a combinatorialist s point of view , since one would like a direct proof of this fact by studying the structure of tfpl configurations . this would also give a direct proof of the bijectivity of @xmath195 , that is to say a proof which does not rely on identity  .",
    "in current work together with ilse fischer  @xcite , we achieve this by studying oriented tfpl configurations . for a given @xmath214 and @xmath6 such that @xmath215 ,",
    "we are able to characterize elements @xmath13 of @xmath117 in terms of the occurrence of @xmath55 specific local sub - configurations in @xmath13 . in the special case of @xmath216",
    ", we obtain the result of proposition  [ prop : csq_bij ] _ for all oriented tfpl configurations _ , and not only the canonically oriented ones .",
    "it follows that all elements of @xmath117 are of the form @xmath193 , from which one deduces easily that all maps in the following commutative diagram are bijections ( the unlabeled map is simply the removal of the orientation ) :"
