    "he purpose of this paper is to formulate a volume integral equation for the determination of the natural modes of helical structures .",
    "low - frequency applications are of particular importance where it can be anticipated the existence of twisted modes of a particularly simple structure .",
    "the presented problem formulation is largely motivated by the need of being able to accurately model the field distribution and losses inside twisting three - phase high - voltage power cables at 50@xmath0 , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . the approach could also potentially be useful for analyzing the wave propagation characteristics of the so called litz wires .",
    "helical waveguide structures have been treated previously such as _ e.g. _ , with helical sheaths @xcite , and approximations for wire helices@xcite .",
    "presently , there are also very promising numerical techniques being developed that are based on finite element modeling @xcite and the method of moments @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there has not been any general presentation regarding analytical modeling of the natural modes of helical structures .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to fill in this gap . on the other hand",
    ", there is a large body of literature on the general dispersion properties of open waveguides , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , as well as on the general properties of the electromagnetic volume integral equations , see _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the volume integral operators in electromagnetics are strongly singular and that many questions regarding their spectral theory remain largely open @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown in very general settings that modes of open waveguides exist and can be interpreted in terms of poles of a meromorphic fourier transform and that these poles depend continuously on the model data ( except for points where poles coalesce or at the boundary of the domain of meromorphicity , _",
    "i.e. _ , at infinity and at the branch - point corresponding to the wavenumber of the exterior domain ) @xcite .",
    "when there are sources present , the modes ( the discrete set of eigenfunctions ) can be obtained as the residues of the poles and the non - discrete set is manifested as an integration along the branch - cut @xcite . in practical circumstances , the branch - cut contribution can often be neglected @xcite .    in this paper , a general helical waveguide structure",
    "is treated by using classical analytic function theory and fourier techniques ( in particular the convolution theorem ) in connection with the electromagnetic volume integral formulation and a cylindrical vector wave expansion of the related dyadic green s functions .",
    "the floquet modes are defined as the poles of the corresponding integral operators , and the analytic periodic green s functions are derived by employing the classical poisson summation formula . two independent approaches ( with and without explicit sources )",
    "are used to derive the resulting infinite system of one - dimensional integral equations .",
    "these equations can then be discretized by truncation and by using a standard collocation method .    as a useful byproduct ,",
    "the periodic dyadic green s functions provide a simple direct calculation of the quasi - static fields generated by thin helical wires .",
    "consider a straight helical waveguide structure of radius @xmath1 consisting of a twisting inhomogeneous and anisotropic material .",
    "the twisting means that the cross - section of the guide is rotating along the longitudinal direction of the structure .",
