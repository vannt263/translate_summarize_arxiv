    "random heteropolymers are chains of molecules displaying quenched disordered interactions .",
    "although they usually do not display a dominant equilibrium conformation as globular proteins do , they have been subject of a substantial theoretical interest . aside from being a model for peptides built out of random sequences of amino acids , like those which are supposed to be involved in prebiotic evolution , random heteropolymers are the starting point to describe the behavior of proteins .",
    "consequently , they have been widely used as a benchmark to study the physics of globular proteins , whose sequence is not random but has undergone natural evolution @xcite , in a way similar to that in which the ideal gas is the starting point to study real gases and the ideal chain is the starting point to study real homopolymers .",
    "the simplest description of a random heteropolymer is through the random energy model ( rem ) @xcite , which assumes that the total energy of the system is the sum of a constant , large number @xmath0 of uncorrelated two  body energies , defined by an average @xmath1 and a standard deviation @xmath2 .",
    "the model predicts a parabolic entropy @xmath3 down to a ground  state energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of contacts per monomer , so that @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the number of conformations available to each monomer .",
    "the thermodynamics of random heteropolymers has been investigated also in the canonical ensemble with a replica approach @xcite , showing the validity of the rem under the condition that only globular conformations contribute to the partition function @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the physics of random heteropolymers has been very helpful in the study of globular proteins , that is of heteropolymers which are non  random and which display at biological temperatures a unique equilibrium conformation ( the `` native '' state ) . in particular , the @xmath8 of random heteropolymers has been used to model the unfolded state of proteins . the attractive property of this @xmath8 , and of the associated @xmath9 , which makes this approach useful is its self  averageness , namely in the limit of large @xmath10 it does not depend on the specific realization of the two  body energies , and consequently on the protein sequence .",
    "if a protein sequence displays in some conformation an energy lower than the sequence",
    " independent value of @xmath9 , this is the native state of the protein and the system displays the two  state thermodynamics typical of proteins @xcite .    this strategy has been successfully applied to lattice models , designing proteins through the minimization of the energy of the sequence on the wanted native conformation @xcite , designing potentials to fold specific sequences @xcite , estimating the effect of mutations in the protein sequence @xcite or studying natural evolution @xcite .",
    "in fact , for lattice ",
    "model heteropolymers it was shown that the free energy is indeed self  averaging @xcite and that the statistical independence of energy levels required by the rem , although not been strictly obeyed , is enough to allow protein design @xcite .",
    "however , lattice models are not very realistic and constrain the polymer much more than what the chemistry of proteins requires .",
    "this favors the applicability of the rem , because depletes the conformational space of correlated conformations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the design of folding sequence in continuous conformational space is much more cumbersome @xcite and the attempt to obtain a potential to fold protein sequences with variational approaches of the kind of refs .",
    "@xcite has been so far frustrated , even using a strong dihedral potential to obtain a lattice  like behavior .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate the thermodynamics of a heteropolymer model in continuous space , in order to understand whether the rem physics applies and what are the related consequences on the study of proteins .",

    "the bulky shape of @xmath72 and the position of the high  q peak at @xmath84 observed in the case @xmath77 suggest a more complicated pattern of rsb , more similar to the full rsb of ising spin glasses @xcite than the one  step rsb observed in our simulations at negative @xmath1 .",
    "the sharp peak at @xmath81 is a polymeric effect : increasing the temperature , the system stabilizes loose conformations characterized by few contacts ( see section [ sec : cg ] ) ; the probability that a pair of such conformations share their few contacts is combinatorially low .",

    "the determination of the lowest conformational energy @xmath9 of a polymer controlled by a given interaction matrix is important to understand the folding of globular proteins .",
    "in fact , the assumption of a self  averaging behaviour of @xmath9 allow to interpret protein evolution as a minimization of their energy @xmath89 in the native conformation and describe the denatured state of the protein with the random energy model @xcite .    to verify these hypoteses , we show in in fig .",

    "the standard deviation of @xmath94 is a few percent of the average and shows no sign of decreasing with @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that there is a non ",
    "negligible variability of @xmath9 with respect to the interaction matrix and that this variability is not a finite  size effect .",
    "for instance , the typical energy scale of interaction between amino acids is @xmath95 and the typical stability of globular proteins ( that depends on @xmath96 ) is of the order of @xmath97 per residue .",
    "consequently , the variability of @xmath9 with respect to the interaction matrix is of the same order of magnitude than the stabilization energy of the protein .",
    "evolution has to pay an extra work to design proteins with an @xmath89 low enough to be robust against mutations and environmental changes which could affect the interaction energy .",
    "moreover , becoming larger is not a good evolutionary strategy for proteins to become more stable , as the variability in @xmath9 would also increase .",
    "to investigate the origin of the variability of @xmath9 , we have plotted the density of contacts @xmath98 within the lowest - energy conformation with respect to its energy density @xmath94 ( see fig . [",

    ", the value of @xmath94 is well correlated to @xmath5 ( cf . the correlation coefficient in the inset of [ fig : ec - n ] ) , suggesting that the variability in @xmath9 is due to the different number of contacts that low  energy conformations can accommodate .",

    "these correspond to more swollen conformations and suffer a much larger variability among realizations of the interaction matrix . to fit properly the high  energy part of the computed @xmath8 it is also necessary to use values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 different from the values set for the interaction matrix ( the fit with the actual values @xmath114 and @xmath115 give a reduced @xmath116 ) .",
    "the picture which emerges is that for negative values of @xmath15 the rem fails because the underlying hypothesis of a constant number of contacts does not apply .",
    "nonetheless , the system can be effectively described as built out of two set of conformations , different for the ( constant ) number of contacts , each of them displaying a rem  like behavior .",
    "the parameters controlling the more  compact conformations are rather independent on the interaction matrix , while those controlling the swollen conformations are not .",

    "as discussed in sect . [ sect : rsb ] , in the case of positive mean of the interaction matrix the rem scenario does not hold . in fact , the shape of @xmath8 associated with the different realizations of the matrix with mean @xmath63 displays a irregular behavior ( see fig . [",

    "the low content of hydrophobic amino acids in this kind of proteins @xcite suggests that the average interaction is much less attractive than that of globular proteins .",
    "the hydrodynamics radius of natively unfolded proteins in solution is either that of a random coil or that of a molten globule , depending on the specific protein @xcite .",
    "this indicates that biological temperature is likely to lie in or close to the transition region ( @xmath126 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nc ] ) , also in the case of coil proteins which get promptly compacted upon binding .",
    "a consequence of this scenario is that the free  energy profile of natively unfolded proteins is quite different from that of unfolded globular proteins . as in ising spin glasses ,",
    "where a full rsb transition applies , the free energy displays a hierarchical tree of states at all energy scales , giving rise to conformational substates reminiscent of those observed in myoglobin but at very low temperature @xcite .",
    "in other words , while the denatured state of globular proteins is expected to display a set of conformations which can only be completely different from each other ( i.e. , are different at the length scale of the whole protein ) , natively unfolded proteins are expected to populate conformations which are different from each other at all possible length scales .    as a matter of fact , several experiments carried out on alpha - synuclein , a natively unfolded protein , give results which are consistent with this picture .",
    "molecule frster resonance energy transfer experiments at room temperature provide broadened distributions of distances between pairs of residues @xcite . while the authors of this work comment that _",
    "( they ) can not eliminate the possibility that peak broadening results from alpha  synuclein sampling of two or more specific conformations with close mean energy ",
    "efficiency values that are not resolved in our measurement _ , a full rsb scenario would explain well such a peak broadening .",
    "a study of the same protein with fluorescent energy transfer combined with electron transfer measurement also shows _ distance distributions that are singlificantly broadened and appear to be continuous at the fitting resolution of 2  _",
    "@xcite , compatibly with the scenario we suggest .",
    "moreover , nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on another natively  unfolded protein , hiv-1 tat , show many weak crosspeaks , more abundant and more broadened than expected from a 92residue protein @xcite . again",
    ", this is compatible with an energy landscape whose roughness involves all length  scales .",
    "the full  rsb scenario has deep consequences in the way one models the experimental data in order to obtain structural information on natively unfolded protein .",
    "in fact , one approach is to try to obtain well - defined clusters of conformations which are overall compatible with the data @xcite .",
    "if a one  step rsb applied , such clusters would be naturally defined as different on the length scale of the whole protein .",
    "but in a full  rsb scenario , where differences apply over a continuum of length scales , one expects the classification of probable conformation to be more complicated , due to the absence of a natural length scale to distinguish between them .",
    "another interesting phenomenon which takes place in frustrated systems is the existence of slow and multiple relaxation time scales and ageing @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these phenomena affect both rsb schemes , although at different scales @xcite .",
    "anyway , they have been observed in the case of natively  unfolded proteins on the time  scale of milliseconds to microseconds @xcite , and not in the denatured state of globular proteins up to the time scale of nanoseconds @xcite , suggesting a marked quantitative difference between the two cases .",
    "the study of random heteropolymers with continuous degrees of freedom and with size comparable to that of small globular proteins is computationally demanding , but important to complement the available mean  field theories and the old simulations done with lattice models and very short polymers .",
    "if the interaction energy between monomers is negative , random heteropolymers display a one  step replica symmetry breaking at low temperatures , and the density of states can be described by a modified random energy model which accounts also for non  compact conformations .",
    "the effect of these swollen conformations is to cause a variability in the lowest energy @xmath9 available to the system with respect to the details of the interaction potential .",
    "such a variability is not negligible and should be accounted in the _ de  novo _ design of globular proteins and in the study of the effect of mutations in protein sequences ..    on the other hand , if the mean interaction energy is positive , a more complicated replica symmetry breaking pattern takes place at low temperatures , suggesting that the free  energy profile is now more complicated .",
    "this scenario is expected to apply to natively  unfolded proteins , whose residues are in average less hydrophobic than those of globular proteins .",
    "we think that the self  adjusting simulated  tempering algorithm employed for this investigation can be useful to study the low  energy properties of other systems without the need of massively parallel computers .    99 e. i. shakhnovich and a. m. gutin , j. phys .",

    "<S> , we apply it to random heteropolymers moving in continuous space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the mean interaction between monomers is negative , the usual description through the random energy model is nearly correct , provided that it is extended to account for non  compact conformations . </S>",
    "<S> if the mean interaction is positive , such a simple description breaks out and the system behaves in a way more similar to ising spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the former case is a model for the denatured state of globular proteins , the latter of naturally  unfolded proteins , whose equilibrium properties thus result qualitatively different . </S>"
