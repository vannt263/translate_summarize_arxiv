    "the phase factor @xmath23 in the bremsstrahlung amplitudes @xmath24 is dictated by the low theorem , while the factor @xmath25 in @xmath22 is determined by @xmath26 invariance and the watson theorem .",
    "the important feature of the @xmath1 amplitude is that the bremsstrahlung component @xmath27 , proportional to @xmath28 , is enhanced by the factor @xmath29 , making it comparable to the direct emission amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "the interference of the electric multipoles ( @xmath30 ) with the magnetic multipole ( @xmath31 ) opens the way to large @xmath2-violating observables .",
    "such interference effects vanish , however , if one sums over the photon polarization .",

    "the presence of the parameter @xmath35 produces a tilted pattern in which there is an asymmetry between the quadrants i+iii compared to ii+iv .",
    "it is this tilt that signals a violation of @xmath2 . by examining the behaviour of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath47 under @xmath2 and @xmath4 , we find that @xmath56 transforms as @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
