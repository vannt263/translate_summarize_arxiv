    "if one wants to preserve einstein s general relativity equations together with spacetime isotropy and homogeneity , one has to postulate some source of negative pressure .",
    "the sources of negative pressure that have been hypothesized include einstein s cosmological constant ( padmanabhan 2003 ; frieman , turner & huterer 2008 ; weinberg 2013 ) , dark energy ( lima 2004 ; caldwell & kamionkowski 2009 ; li _ et al .",

    "_ 2009 , 2010 ) . nowadays , the dark energy is supported by several independent observational data , such as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and other galaxy clusters observations , cosmic background radiation , observational hubble constant data as well as age of the universe ( see frieman , turner & huterer 2008 and weinberg 2013 ) .    with more than 700 type ia supernovae discovered ( betoule _ et al .",
    "_ 2014 ) , the constraints on cosmological parameters inferred from sne ia are now limited by systematic errors rather than by statistical errors .",
    "an important systematic error source is the mapping of the cosmic opacity .",
    "the sne ia observations are affected by at least four different sources of opacity , namely , the milky way , the hosting galaxy , intervening galaxies , and the intergalactic medium .",
    "the opacity can also occur by extragalactic magnetic fields that can turn photons into unobserved particles ( e.g. light axions , chameleons , gravitons , kaluza - klein modes ) ( avgoustidis _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 & 2010 ) .",
    "recently , an interesting result was obtained by lima , cunha & zanchin ( 2011 ) .",
    "these authors discussed two different scenarios with cosmic absorption and concluded that only if the cosmic opacity is fully negligible , the description of an accelerating universe powered by dark energy or some alternative gravity theory must be invoked ( see also li _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ) .",
    "an interesting way to test the quality of the sne ia data has been performed in recent years by confronting them with data sets which are cosmic opacity independent .",
    "for instance , holanda , carvalho & alcaniz ( 2013 ) as well as liao , avgoustidis & zhengxiang ( 2015 ) used current measurements of the expansion rate @xmath8 and sne ia data to impose cosmological model - independent constraints on cosmic opacity .",
    "these authors found that a completely transparent universe is in agreement with the data considered ( see also avgoustidis _ et al . _ 2009 , 2010 for analyses in a flat @xmath9cdm framework ) .",
    "holanda & busti ( 2014 ) explored the possible existence of an opacity at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) in @xmath9cdm context by using @xmath8 data and luminosity distance of gamma ray bursts .",
    "the samples were compatible with a transparent universe at 1@xmath11 level .",
    "on the other hand , ambiguous results also have arisen from this kind of analysis .",
    "( 2012 ) by using baryons acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ) and sn ia data found that an opaque universe is preferred in redshift regions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , whereas a transparent universe is favoured in redshift regions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "when these authors considered the entire redshift range , their result were still consistent with a transparent universe at @xmath18 confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "nair , jhingan & deepak ( 2012 ) also compared distance measurements obtained from sne ia and bao and they found that the supernovae are brighter than expected from bao measurements . obtaining a similar result , basset & kunz ( 2004 ) found a @xmath19 violation caused by excess brightening of sne ia at @xmath20 when confronted them via cosmic distance duality relation with angular diameter distances ( add ) from compact objects , perhaps due to lensing magnification bias . by testing the luminosity distance of sne ia with",
    "add from galaxy clusters , li _ et al . _",
    "( 2013 ) have put constraints on cosmic opacity . however , the limits thus obtained rely on the assumptions used to describe the galaxy clusters morphology .",
    "the results of holanda , carvalho & alcaniz ( 2013 ) also rely on the sne ia light curve fitter ( salt2 , mlcs2k2 ) . in this way , it is still interesting to investigate and compare different observational data and look for any systematics in them .    in this paper we show that it is possible to obtain opacity free luminosity distances from age estimates of old objects and , by comparing it with luminosity distance from sne ia , namely , union 2.1 compilation , to impose constraints on cosmic opacity .",
    "no specific cosmological model is adopted in our analysis .",
    "we only consider the flat friedmann - robertson - walker framework and we use the _ planck _ constraint on the cosmic total age ( ade _ et al_. 2016 ) to put constraints over @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our new method to verify the cosmic opacity , while in section iii the observational quantities used in this work are discussed .",
    "the corresponding constraints on the opacity are investigated and discussed in section iv .",
    "we summarize our main results in section v.",
    "as well known , a reduction of photons number from a luminosity source caused by an absorption leads to a modification of its inferred luminosity distance , increasing it with respect to a transparent universe .",
    "mathematically , if there is a opacity or extinction between observer and a light source , the flux received is attenuated by a factor @xmath22 ( chen & kantowski , 2009a ; 2009b ) . in this way",
    ", the inferred luminosity distance of the source , @xmath23 is related to the true luminosity distance ( cosmic opacity independent ) by @xmath24 therefore , the observed distance modulus is given by @xmath25\\tau(z ) .",

    "1b we plot the original age added with an incubation time @xmath33 gyr ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "as we are only interested on the derivative @xmath31 , instead of assuming an incubation time and using the total age from other observations , we choose to fit @xmath34 .",
    "if we assume that the incubation time is constant , that is , independent of redshift , one may see that @xmath35 only differs from @xmath34 by a constant .",

    "in the following , we describe the data sets used in our analyses .    * for the cosmic opacity dependent data , we use the union 2.1 sne ia sample .",
    "this sample is an update of the original union compilation ( amanullah _ et al .",
    "_ 2010 ) that comprises 580 data points including recent large samples from other surveys and uses salt2 for sne ia lightcurve fitting ( guy _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) . as the union 2.1 consists of several subsamples , suzuki _",
    "et al_. ( 2012 ) allowed a different absolute magnitude value for each subsample thereby making the impact of the cosmological model negligible .",
    "* as the cosmic opacity independent data , we use the age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies distributed over the redshift interval @xmath0 , as recently analysed by simon , verde & jimenez ( 2005 ) .",

    "this factor accounts for our ignorance about the amount of time since the beginning of the structure formation in the universe until the formation time of the object .",
    "however , such a treatment assumes that all of these galaxies need to have formed at the same time for their ages to trace out the universe history .",
    "we still assume @xmath49 uncertainty on measurement of age of each galaxy ( dantas _ et al_. 2009 , 2011 ; samushia _ et al_. 2010 ) . as commented by avgoustidis _",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) the method of age determination relies on the detailed shapes of galaxy spectra but not on galaxy luminosities .",
    "it will therefore not be affected by a non - zero opacity since @xmath50 is assumed ( and constrained by independent observations ) not to be strongly wavelength dependent in the optical band ( see also mortsell & goobar 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "we estimate the best - fit to the set of parameters @xmath51 , by evaluating the likelihood distribution function , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the distance modulus and its uncertainty from sne ia .",
    "the cosmic opacity , @xmath32 , is parametrized by two functions :    * p1 - @xmath58 .",
    "this linear expression can be derived from the usual cosmic distance duality relation parametrization @xmath59 for small values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath60 quantifies departures from transparency ( see avgoustidis _",
    "et al . _ 2009 ) .",
    "* p2 - @xmath62 , which avoids the @xmath32 divergence at high redshifts of the linear parametrization .    because there is so many free parameters in both models , we choose to sample the likelihood through monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis .",
    "a simple and powerful mcmc method is the so called affine invariant mcmc ensemble sampler by goodman and weare ( 2010 ) , which was implemented in python language with the emcee software by foreman - mackey _",
    "this mcmc method has the advantage over simple metropolis - hasting ( mh ) methods of depending on only one scale parameter of the proposal distribution and on the number of walkers . while mh methods in general depend on the parameter covariance matrix , that is , it depends on @xmath63 tuning parameters , where @xmath64 is dimension of parameter space .",
    "the main idea of the goodman - weare affine - invariant sampler is the so called `` stretch move '' , where the position ( parameter vector in parameter space ) of a walker ( chain ) is determined by the position of the other walkers .",
    "foreman - mackey _",
    "_ modified this method , in order to make it suitable for parallelization , by splitting the walkers in two groups , then the position of a walker in one group is determined by _ only _ the position of walkers of the other group .",

    "none of these analyses have been able to discard a transparent universe .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new model cosmological independent method to probe the cosmic opacity .",
    "although that the universe acceleration is supported by several other independent probes , investigating the cosmic opacity on the sne ia data is an important issue , in order to search for some source of unknown systematic error .",
    "if some extra dimming is still present , the sne ia observations will give us unreal values to main cosmological parameters and the universe will seem as accelerating at a different rate than it actually is .    to perform our analyses ,",
    "we have considered the following cosmological data : 580 sne ia from union 2.1 compilation and old objects , specifically , 32 old galaxies ( @xmath0 ) . since the method to determine",
    "the ages relies on the detailed shapes of galaxy spectra but not on luminosities , they are cosmic opacity independent .",
