    "the satisfaction of constrained boolean formulae , the so called satisfiability ( sat ) problem , is a key problem of complexity theory in computer science that can be recast as an energy minimization problem ( ground state search ) in diluted spin glass models .",
    "many hard computational problems have been shown to be np - complete  @xcite through a polynomial mapping onto the sat problem , which in turn was the first problem identified as np - complete by cook in 1971  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , the research activity has become more and more focused on the study of the random version of sat problem defined as follows .",

    "then repeat this process by drawing independently @xmath6 random clauses @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the logical and of all clauses @xmath9 is said to be satisfiable if there exists a logical assignment of the @xmath10 evaluating @xmath9 to true , unsatisfiable otherwise .",
    "numerical experiments have concentrated upon the study of the probability @xmath11 that a given @xmath9 including @xmath12 clauses be satisfiable . for large sizes",
    ", there appears a remarkable behavior  : @xmath13 seems to be unity for @xmath14 and vanishes for @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "such an abrupt threshold behavior , separating a so - called sat phase from an unsat one , has indeed been rigorously confirmed for 2-sat , which is in p , with @xmath16  @xcite . for @xmath17 ,",
    "k - sat is np - complete and much less is known .",
    "the existence of a sharp transition has not been rigorously proven yet but relatively good estimates of the thresholds have been found : @xmath18  @xcite . moreover , some rigorous lower and upper bounds to @xmath19 , have been established  @xcite .",
    "the interest in random k - sat arises from the fact that it has been observed numerically that hard random instances are created when the problems are critically constrained , i.e.  close to the sat / unsat phase boundary  @xcite .",
    "the study of such hard instances represent a theoretical challenge towards a concrete understanding of complexity and the analysis of algorithms",
    ". moreover , hard random instances are also test - bed for the optimization of heuristic ( incomplete ) search procedures which are widely used in practice .",
    "the statistical mechanics study of random k - sat have provided some geometrical understanding of the onset of complexity at the phase transition through the introduction of a functional order parameter which describes the geometrical structure of the space of solutions .",
    "the nature of the sat / unsat transition for the different values of @xmath5 appears to be a particularly relevant prediction  @xcite .",
    "the sat / unsat transition is accompanied by a smooth ( respectively abrupt ) change in the structure of the solutions of the 2-sat ( resp .",
    "3-sat ) problem .",
    "more specifically , at the phase boundary a finite fraction of the variables become fully constrained while the entropy density remains finite .",
    "such a fraction of frozen variables ( i.e.  those variables which take the same value in all solutions ) may undergo a continuous ( 2-sat ) or discontinuous ( 3-sat ) growth at the critical point .",
    "this discrepancy is responsible for the difference of typical complexities of both models recently observed in numerical studies .",
    "the typical solving time of search algorithms displays an easy - hard pattern as a function of @xmath20 with a peak of complexity close to the threshold .",
    "the peak in search cost seems to scale polynomially with @xmath1 for the 2-sat problem and exponentially with @xmath1 in the 3-sat case . from an intuitive point of view , the search for solutions ought to be more time - consuming in presence of a finite fraction of fully quenched variables since the exact determination of the latter requires an almost exhaustive enumeration of their configurations .    to test this conjecture ,",
    "a mixed @xmath21-model has been proposed , including a fraction @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) of clauses of length two ( resp .",
    "three ) and thus interpolating between the 2-sat @xmath24 and 3-sat @xmath25 problems .",
    "the statistical mechanics analysis predicts that the sat / unsat transition becomes abrupt when @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "precise numerical simulations support the conjecture that the polynomial / exponential crossover occurs at the same critical @xmath27 . though the problem is both critical ( @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) and np - complete for any @xmath30 ,",
    "it is only when the phase transition becomes of the same type of the 3-sat case that hardness shows up .",
    "an additional argument in favor of this conclusion is given by the analysis of the finite - size effects on @xmath11 and the emergence of some universality for @xmath29 .",
    "a detailed account of these findings may be found in  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath29 the exponent @xmath0 , which describes the shrinking of the critical window where the transition takes place , is observed to remain constant and close to the value expected for 2-sat .",
    "the critical behavior is the same of the percolation transition in random graphs ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath31 the size of the window shrinks following some @xmath22-dependent exponents toward its statistical lower bound  @xcite but",
    "numerical data did not allow for any precise estimate .    in this paper , we study an exactly solvable version of the random 2+p sat model which displays new features and allows us to settle the issue of universality of the critical exponents .",
    "the threshold of the model can be computed exactly as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath22 in the whole range @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "rare events are found to be dominant also in the low @xmath20 phase , where a coexistence of satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances is found .",
    "a detailed analysis for the @xmath33 case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the existence of a global  polynomial time  algorithm for determining satisfiability allows us to perform a finite size scaling analysis around the exactly known critical points over huge samples and to show that indeed the exponent controlling the size of the critical window ceases to maintain its constant value @xmath34 and becomes dependent on @xmath22 as soon as the phase transition becomes discontinuous , i.e.  for @xmath35 . above @xmath27 and below @xmath36 ,",

    "the model we study can be viewed as the mixed @xmath21 extension of the 3-_hyper - sat _ ( hsat ) model discussed in  @xcite , as much as the @xmath21-sat  @xcite is an extension of the usual k - sat model . in computer science literature the hsat model",
    "is also named xor - sat and its critical behavior is considered an open issue  @xcite .",
    "given a set of @xmath1 boolean variables @xmath41 we can write an instance of our model as follows . firstly we define the elementary constraints ( a mixture of 4 and 2-clauses sets with 50% satisfying assignments ) : @xmath42 for the 3-hsat part , and @xmath43 for the 2-hsat part .",

    "is easily solved by local and global algorithms , whereas interesting behaviors are found for @xmath31 , where the local algorithms fail .",
    "the above combinatorial definition can be recast in a simpler form as a minimization problem of a cost - energy function on a topological structure which is a mixture of a random graph ( 2-spin links ) and hyper - graph ( 3-spin hyper - links ) .",

    "the _ unfrustrated _ , i.e.  ferromagnetic , version undergoes a para  ferro transition , because the same topological constraints that drive the glass ( mixed sat / unsat to unsat ) transition in the frustrated model are shown to be the ones responsible for the appearance of a nonzero value of the magnetization in the unfrustrated one  @xcite .",
    "we shall take advantage of such coincidence of critical lines by making the analytical calculation for the simpler ferromagnetic model .",
    "moreover , the nature of the phase transition changes from second to random first order , when @xmath22 crosses the critical value @xmath66 . for @xmath31 the critical point @xmath65 is preceded by a dynamical glass transition at @xmath67 where ergodicity breaks down and local algorithms get stuck ( local algorithms are procedures which update the system configuration only by changing a finite number of variable at the same time , e.g.  all single or multi spin flip dynamics , together with usual computer scientists heuristic algorithms ) . the dynamical glass transition exist for both versions of the model  @xcite and corresponds to the formation of a locally stable ferromagnetic solution in the unfrustrated model  @xcite ( the local stability is intimately related to the ergodicity breaking ) .",

    "<S> such instances differ by a non - extensive quantity in the ground state energy of the associated diluted spin - glass model . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the critical exponent @xmath0 , controlling the size of the critical window where the probability of having solutions vanishes , depends on the model parameters , shedding light on the link between random hyper - graph topology and universality classes . in the case of random satisfiability , </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior was conjectured to be connected to the onset of computational intractability . </S>"
