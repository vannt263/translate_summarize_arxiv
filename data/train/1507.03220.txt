    "the collision of an ionized blast shell with an ambient plasma triggers the formation of shocks if the collision speed exceeds a threshold value .",
    "the critical speed depends on the plasma wave mode that is mediating the shock and on the importance of coulomb collisions between particles",
    ". if the mean frequency , with which the plasma particles collide , is well below all resonance frequencies of the plasma , then the effects of binary collisions are negligible and the shocks are mediated by electrostatic and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the plasma processes that sustain a collisionless shock and the structure of the associated electromagnetic fields vary strongly between the different plasma regimes .",
    "solar system shocks , like the earth s bow shock @xcite , are immersed in a plasma that is carrying a relatively strong magnetic field and they connect two plasmas that collide at a non - relativistic speed .",
    "such shocks are usually mediated by magnetosonic waves .",
    "the collision speed between a supernova blast shell and the ism at a late evolution phase is similar to the collision speed between the solar wind and the earth s bow shock .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field in the ism , into which a supernova remnant ( snr ) shock expands , is weaker by an order of magnitude than that in the solar wind plasma at the earth s orbit .",
    "magnetosonic waves , which have a low field amplitude , may not be able to sustain permanently the shock because other instabilities develop faster and on a smaller spatial scale .",
    "simulations have shown that drift instabilities and electrostatic turbulence can in some cases suppress the growth of a magnetosonic wave @xcite .",
    "as we go to higher flow speeds , the plasma shocks become magnetized by filamentation instabilities @xcite .",
    "we consider here shocks , which develop in an initially unmagnetized and collisionless plasma .",
    "such shocks are frequently observed in the laboratory @xcite and they might be representative for snr shocks in their late evolution phase .",
    "an electrostatic shock in its most basic form is characterized by a potential difference , which is sustained self - consistently by the plasma .",
    "the shock connects the downstream region and an upstream region ahead of the shock .",
    "electrons stream from the denser downstream region into the upstream region and create a charge imbalance between both regions .",
    "the denser downstream plasma goes on a positive potential relative to the upstream plasma .    the upstream plasma streams towards the shock at a speed , which exceeds the ion acoustic speed .",
    "the upstream ions are slowed down and compressed by the potential jump as they cross the shock .",
    "the potential jump reflects some of the incoming upstream ions , which then move back upstream .",
    "the remainder of the incoming ions enters the downstream region , which expands due to the accumulation of the inflowing ions .",
    "the shock is thus not stationary in the downstream frame of reference and moves upstream .",
    "an electrostatic shock is an ion phase space structure , which consists of inflowing upstream ions , reflected ions and ions that overcame the positive potential and accumulated downstream of the shock .",
    "the electrostatic field , which mediates the shock , will also accelerate some of the downstream ions into the upstream direction and act as a double layer .",
    "many shocks in unmagnetized plasma are a combination of a double layer and of an electrostatic shock .",
    "such hybrid structures @xcite are characterized by a unipolar electric field . in what follows",
    "we shall refer to these hybrid structures as plasma shocks to distinguish them from pure electrostatic shocks .",
    "the incoming upstream ions , which have been reflected by the electrostatic shock , and the downstream ions , which have been accelerated upstream by the double layer , form a beam that outruns the plasma shock .",
    "we shall refer to this beam as the shock - reflected ion beam .",
    "the number density of this beam can be a significant fraction of that of the incoming upstream ions , which implies that the ion number density ahead of the plasma shock is well above that in the far upstream region . in what follows",
    ", we refer to this region as the foreshock .",
    "the counterstreaming nonrelativistic and unmagnetized ion beams drive the electrostatic ion acoustic instability in the foreshock @xcite .",
    "the speed of the shock - reflected ions in the upstream frame of reference exceeds the ion acoustic speed .",
    "the ion acoustic instability can , however , only be destabilized if the beam velocity component along the wave vector is subsonic .",
    "the wave vectors of the unstable waves can thus not be parallel to the plasma flow velocity vector .",
    "oblique electrostatic waves grow and the obliquity angle is such that the beam velocity component along the wave vector is comparable to the ion acoustic speed @xcite . obliquely propagating ion acoustic waves grow in the foreshock region and modulate the incoming upstream ions .",
    "the plasma shock is either transformed into a shock with a broad transition layer @xcite or it is destroyed by the inflowing turbulent plasma @xcite .",
    "previous simulation studies have addressed the evolution of ( quasi-)planar plasma shocks .",
    "the planarity has been enforced in the pic simulations by resolving only one spatial direction or by choosing initial conditions that are uniform along one direction . however , in particular the plasma shocks in laboratory experiments are often nonplanar .",
    "this motivates our study of the formation and evolution of curved shocks with a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation .",
    "the shock curvature is introduced in our simulation through the following setup .",
    "the two electron - ion clouds collide at a boundary , which is orthogonal to the spatially uniform collision direction at the simulation s start .",
    "the mean speed of the plasma along the collision direction varies as a function of the orthogonal direction and this velocity shear gives rise to a shock front that becomes increasingly curved in time .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity change is comparable to the ion acoustic speed .",
    "we find that the shock formation and its stability are not affected by this large velocity shear .",
    "the life - time of the plasma shocks is of the order of tens of inverse ion plasma frequencies .",
    "the shock transition layer is transformed after this time by the onset of ion acoustic turbulence in the foreshock . the transition from a sharp electron skin depth - scale structure into a broad transition layer is also observed for planar shocks .",
    "the key difference between the structure of the curved shock and a planar shock is tied to the disalignment of the electric field with the flow velocity vector of the incoming upstream plasma .",
    "the disalignment gives rise to a rotational component of the electron flow , which yields the growth of magnetic field patches .",
    "these patches are coherent over tens of electron skin depths and their size is limited by the simulation box dimension .",
    "their amplitude yields a ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the cyclotron frequency of about 100 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the pic code and the initial conditions we use .",
    "section 3 examines the formation and the evolution of the pair of electrostatic shocks .",

    "the electromagnetic fields are evolved in time via ampre s law and faraday s law . @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 most codes fullfill the equations @xmath2 and @xmath3 either as constraints or via correction steps .",
    "the plasma is approximated by an ensemble of computational particles ( cps ) , which correspond to volume elements of the phase space density distribution .",
    "the charge - to - mass ratio of the cps equals that of the plasma particles they represent . their momentum and position are updated with the relativistic lorentz force equation @xmath4 the cp with the index @xmath5 of the species @xmath6 with the position @xmath7 and the relativistic momentum @xmath8 has the charge @xmath9 and the mass @xmath10 .",

    "the summation over all current density contributions yields the macroscopic current density @xmath14 , which updates the electromagnetic fields via ampre s law .",
    "a pair of shocks is generated in the simulation by the collision of two spatially uniform plasma clouds of equal density .",
    "each cloud consists of electrons with the charge @xmath15 ( @xmath16 : elementary charge ) , the mass @xmath17 , the number density @xmath18 and the temperature @xmath19 kev .",
    "we model deuterium ions with the number density @xmath18 , the mass @xmath20 and the temperature @xmath21 ev .",
    "we motivate our choice for the initial conditions as follows .",
    "the collision of two plasma clouds in laboratory- or astrophysical settings usually involves two plasmas with densities that differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "the blast shell , which is ejected during a supernova , is composed of stellar material .",
    "its density is thus initially much higher than that of the ambient plasma , which is the stellar wind the star emanated prior to the supernova .",
    "a laser - generated blast shell is also much denser than the ambient medium , which is the residual gas that has been ionized by secondary x - ray radiation from the target .",
    "the blast shells are practically unaffected by the ambient medium during their initial expansion phase and they expand in the form of rarefaction waves . the front of the blast shell becomes faster and thinner in time .",
    "once the expansion speed of the blast shell becomes supersonic and once the ram pressure of the expanding blast shell becomes comparable to the thermal pressure of the ambient medium , the front can be confined and shocks form .",
    "experimental observations @xcite and pic simulations @xcite suggest that shocks form when the densities of the colliding clouds become comparable . selecting equal densities for both colliding plasma clouds should thus be a valid initial condition .",
    "the electron and ion temperatures we use are typical for plasmas , which are created when an ultrashort laser pulse ablates a solid target and if time scales are considered , which are short compared to the time it takes to establish a thermal equilibrium via collisions between electrons and ions .",
    "the temperature of the electrons in the ambient plasma , which has been ionized by secondary x - ray emissions from the laser - ablated target , is conparable to 1 kev .",
    "the temperatures of the ions of the ambient medium and of the blast shell are usually well below that of the electrons @xcite .",
    "deuterium ions have the same charge - to - mass ratio as the fully ionized light atoms , which we usually encounter in laser - plasma experiments , and they have the largest thermal velocity spread for a given temperature .",
    "hence they will provide the strongest ion landau damping .",
    "if we observe the growth of ion acoustic waves for counter - streaming beams of deuterium , then the same will be true for equally hot plasmas , which consist of heavier ions with the same charge - to - mass ratio as deuterium .",
    "the plasma frequencies of the electrons and of the ions are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "the ion acoustic speed is @xmath26 m / s .",
    "the simulation domain has the dimensions @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the electron skin depth .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic along @xmath29 and open along @xmath30 .",
    "choosing periodic boundaries along @xmath29 implies that our simulation evolves in time a periodic chain of blast shells rather than a solitary one .",
    "the simulation domain is split up into two equal parts along @xmath30 .",
    "the blast shell occupies the interval @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the white interval corresponds to voxels , in which we find ions from both plasma clouds .",
    "we have examined the formation and evolution of a pair of shocks in an initially unmagnetized plasma .",
    "two plasma clouds , which consisted of electrons and ions , collided at a boundary , which was initially planar .",

    "the electrons of both clouds had the same temperature .",
    "the electron temperature exceeded that of the ions by a factor of 5 .",
    "the electrons and ions of each cloud had the same mean speed at any position and the plasma was initially free of any net charge and current .",
    "the collision speed normal to the initial collision boundary varied as a function of the position along the boundary .",
    "the collision speed was highest in the center of the simulation box and decreased linearly with a decreasing distance to the periodic boundary , on which the collision speed reached its minimum value .",
    "we have obtained the following results .",
    "a pair of shocks can form in a plasma with a large velocity shear .",
    "these hybrid structures that consist of an electrostatic shock and of a double layer have a lifetime that is comparable to that of planar shocks .",
    "the shock normal is initially anti - parallel to the velocity vector of the incoming upstream ions .",
    "the incoming upstream ions are slowed down and compressed along the shock normal direction and no particle acceleration takes place in the plane that is orthogonal to the shock normal .",
    "the plasma dynamics involves only the position and velocity along the shock normal and the shock dynamics is one - dimensional .",
    "consequently the variation of the shock speed in the downstream frame of reference and the plasma compression with the collision speed resembles that in the parametric study of one - dimensional plasma shocks of @xcite .",
    "the shock dynamics becomes two - dimensional after about 70 inverse ion plasma frequencies .",
    "the ion density differences in the downstream region are equilibrated by thermal diffusion . the density of the downstream region equilibrates at the previously highest value , which was reached behind the fastest plasma shock .",
    "the transition layer of the plasma shock is transformed from a sharp unipolar electric field pulse into a broad layer of electrostatic turbulence .",
    "the latter converts the directed flow energy of the upstream ions into heat along all three velocity directions , which leads to a full thermalization of the inflowing upstream ions by the shock .",
    "the formation of the plasma shock and the associated increase of the ion compression yields a sudden increase of the positive potential of the double layer .",
    "the ions that cross the double layer towards the upstream direction are accelerated to a higher speed after the shock has formed and they catch up with the ions that crossed the double layer at an earlier time .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity change is here sufficient to trigger the formation of a shock , which is located ahead of the main shock and has a life - time of the order of a few inverse ion plasma frequencies .",
    "the formation of a secondary shock ahead of the primary one has been observed by @xcite .",
    "the secondary shock has been attributed the heat wave , which outran the radiative shock in this experiment .",
    "we can compare the life - time of this secondary shock to that we have observed in our simulation .",
    "the residual gas in ref .",
    "@xcite consisted of a mixture of xenon and nitrogen gas with a mass density of @xmath119 .",
    "let us consider the case study in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the residual gas consists entirely of nitrogen and we furthermore assume that the nitrogen is fully ionized .",
    "we obtain an ion plasma frequency @xmath120 .",
    "our simulation would cover a time scale of about 50 ps , which is more than three orders of magnitude shorter than the life - time of the second shock in ref .",
    "@xcite . a lower ionization state of the nitrogen and the presence of neutral nitrogen would reduce the ion plasma frequency and extend the life - time of the secondary shock .",
    "a mix of nitrogen with different ionization states may also affect this life - time .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that the life - time of the secondary shock could be extended by a factor of 1000 . the secondary shock , which has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , can thus not be explained in terms of the subshock we have observed here .",
    "we observed the growth of large magnetic field patches in our simulation . initially the magnetic field growth was limited to the ion cloud overlap layer .",
    "magnetic fields can be generated via the weibel instability @xcite in spatially localized ion density accumulations such as shocks @xcite and rarefaction waves @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field structures observed at later times expanded into the upstream region and they were not showing spatial oscillations on an electron skin depth - scale , which are typical for the magnetic fields driven by the weibel instability .",
    "the magnetic fields were coherent over tens of electron skin depths and the area they covered was limited by the dimensions of the simulation box and by the simulation time .",
    "the large - scale magnetic fields started to grow when the shock normal was no longer aligned with the plasma flow velocity vector .",
    "we have attributed the large scale magnetic field to currents , which initially develop close to the cusp in the overlap layer .",
    "the simulation shows that the magnetic field eventually diffuses out of the overlap layer .",
    "experimental observations indicate that some snr shocks are immersed in magnetic fields with amplitudes that exceed by far the values one would expect from the shock compression of the magnetic field of the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays can magnetize the interstellar medium on large spatial scales @xcite .",
    "we scale the growth time of the magnetic field and the size of the magnetic patches to the plasma parameters found close to snr shocks in order to determine if the corrugation of plasma shocks could be important for the magnetic field generation at snr shocks .",
    "we take the reference value 10 @xmath121 for the ion number density close to an snr shock .",
    "our simulation duration would correspond to @xmath122 s. the spatial size @xmath123 of the magnetic field patches would correspond to about 50 km and their field amplitude would be of the order of 10 nt .",
    "the values for the growth time and the size of the magnetic field patches are microscopic compared to the size and the evolution time of an snr shock .",
    "however , the magnetic field amplitude generated in our simulation exceeds that of the interstellar magnetic field by an order of magnitude .",
    "a corrugated shock front could thus generate magnetic fields ahead of the shock which are significantly stronger than those of the interstellar medium and it could compress these as it propagates across them .    the periodic boundary conditions along the y - direction have limited the lateral expansion of the magnetic field patch at late times .",
    "an electron , which moves at the thermal speed , could cross the simulation box several times along the y - direction during the simulation time .",
    "numerical artifacts , which are caused by the wrap - around of electrons , can usually be neglected because the electrons are scattered on the way by the electrostatic simulation noise .",
    "the key findings of this paper should however not be affected by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the net current that drives the magnetic field is generated in a small spatial interval close to the cusps that is far from the boundaries .",
    "the simulation box geometry will affect the shape of the generated magnetic field , but not its generation mechanism .",
    "the stability of the shocks is also not affected by the boundary conditions because the thermal speed of the ions is not high enough to let them cross the simulation box during the simulation time .",
