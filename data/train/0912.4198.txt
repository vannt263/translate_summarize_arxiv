    "the experiments with nuclei at the cern sps are dedicated to the search for evidence of a deconfined state of quarks and gluons at high temperatures , separated from conventional hadronic matter by a critical line in the two - dimensional phase diagram @xmath3 .",
    "close to this line significant fluctuations associated with the quark - hadron phase transition occur . in principle",
    "the experimental study of these fluctuations becomes feasible in a class of nuclear collisions whose reaction volume freezes out in this area .",
    "the underlying theory of strongly interacting matter ( qcd ) suggests that , across the critical line , the phase transition is of first order , at least for large values of @xmath4 , whereas at zero chemical potential @xmath5 the transition becomes a smooth crossover @xcite .",
    "this picture implies that there is a point in the phase diagram , located at nonzero baryonic density , where the first - order transition line stops ( endpoint ) . on the basis of general considerations",
    "this endpoint is characterized by a second - order phase transition and it becomes a distinct property of strongly interacting matter ( qcd critical endpoint ) .",
    "the related critical phenomena give rise to density fluctuations which obey appropriate power - laws , specified by the critical exponents of this transition @xcite .",
    "this critical endpoint of qcd matter is the remnant of the chiral phase transition , and its existence becomes the fact that light quarks acquire a small but nonzero mass which breaks chiral symmetry of strong interactions explicitly @xcite .",
    "+    quantitatively , the power - laws of qcd matter at criticality describe the density fluctuations of zero mass @xmath6-particles produced abundantly in a nuclear collision at the critical point @xcite .",
    "in particular , critical fluctuations of the @xmath6-field ( @xmath7 ) in the transverse configuration plane , with respect to the beam axis , are characterized by a power - law at large distances of the form @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the isothermal critical exponent of hot qcd matter @xmath11 .",
    "any experimental attempt to verify this power - law as a signature of the qcd critical point must rely on the corresponding effect in momentum space in analogy to conventional matter at criticality , where a similar power - law in configuration space leads to the spectacular observable effect of critical opalescence @xcite in momentum space ( scattering of long wavelength light ) .",
    "in fact , the correlator in momentum space @xmath12 associated with the occupation number of sigmas in transverse momentum states , obeys in the case of critical qcd matter a power - law for small @xmath13 of the form @xmath14 which reflects the critical nature of density fluctuations ( of sigmas ) in configuration space .",

    "a cut of 1 sigma around the momentum dependent pion peak of the @xmath29 distribution was applied , reducing the residual background of other particle types to a very low level ( less than @xmath39% ) .",

    "the sigma sector of the cmc events is characterized by self - similar density fluctuations corresponding to a fractal set with dimension @xmath40 in transverse momentum space .",
    "these fluctuations are not transferred to the daughter pions directly due to decay kinematics .",
    "using the fact that the critical sigma sector as well as its geometrical properties are known in the cmc events one has a measure for the efficiency of a reconstruction algorithm using the observed momenta of pions of opposite charge @xmath41 .",
    "in such a scheme the direct observation of the critical sigmas is not possible as they are hidden in a large background of @xmath1 pairs , formed from pions originating from two different sigmas .",
    "however even if the sigma itself is not observable its self - similar fluctuations in the isoscalar sector of pions can be revealed by using a suitable algorithm which is developed and extensively described in @xcite .",
    "its basic steps are summarized in the following :    1 .   for each event in a given data set , consisting of identified positive and negative pions , all possible pairs @xmath1 with invariant mass in a small kinematical window of size @xmath42 above the two - pion threshold are formed : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",

    "( [ eq : epswin ] ) can be used to displace the kinematical window of analysis along the dipion invariant - mass axis as well as to modify its size . such a displacement can be useful in order to avoid the presence of coulomb correlations in the considered data set .",
    "in fact if @xmath48 fulfils the constraint @xmath50  mev ( @xmath51  mev ) the domain of coulomb correlated @xmath1 pairs is excluded from the considered kinematical window in the reconstructed dipion sector @xcite .",
    "after this filtering procedure , only @xmath1 pairs satisfying the condition ( [ eq : epswin ] ) are retained for further analysis .",
    "the pion pairs produced from the previous step are used to analyze the density fluctuations in the isoscalar sector , employing as a suitable tool the @xmath52 transverse momentum factorial moments @xcite : @xmath53 with @xmath24 the number of cells in transverse momentum space and @xmath54 the number of reconstructed dipions in the @xmath55-th cell .",
    "a power - law dependence @xmath56 for large @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the corresponding intermittency exponent ) indicates the presence of self - similar fluctuations in transverse momenta .",
    "however before judging the power - law behavior of the factorial moments one has to eliminate the effect of non - critical dipions present in the events ( step 1 ) as a result of combinatorial background ( see step 3 ) .",
    "3 .   the second factorial moment calculated in step 2",
    "is built by the density - density correlation between any two dipions @xmath59 consisting both of critical sigmas ( critical dipions ) and non - critical dipions .",
    "the dominant background in @xmath60 consists of density - density correlations between two non - critical dipions and must be subtracted in order to reveal the self - similar correlations between two critical dipions , if they exist .",
    "practically , to achieve this subtraction we assume that the number of dipions @xmath54 in the @xmath55-th transverse momentum space cell occurring in ( [ eq : facmom ] ) is decomposed in signal @xmath61 ( critical sigmas ) and background @xmath62 ( non - critical dipions ) which are ( approximately ) statistically independent : @xmath63 inserting ( [ eq : decomp ] ) in ( [ eq : facmom ] ) and assuming further that the background is efficiently simulated by mixed events we obtain the following formula for the subtracted factorial moment @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the second factorial moment in transverse momentum space calculated using dipions originating from mixed events while @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the mean numbers of reconstructed dipions in a cell obtained from data and mixed events , respectively . in @xmath64 a large part of the non - critical dipions",
    "are expected to be eliminated and the fluctuations carried by the critical @xmath1 pairs can be revealed to a large extent .",

    "@xmath64 is expected to possess a power - law behavior : @xmath70 with the critical index @xmath71 determined by the universality class of the transition @xcite .",

    "the resulting values @xmath79 ( dof = number of degrees of freedom ) and @xmath75 approaching @xmath80 indicate that the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath24 is consistent with a power - law behavior .",
    "the proposed subtraction method is an approximate one , its validity is discussed below based on the results of the critical monte carlo .",
    "it is known in the literature that the intermittency exponents are sensitive to the multiplicity of the analyzed events @xcite . as a consequence , in order to compare the results of intermittency analysis in systems having different sizes @xmath0 , and therefore different charged pion multiplicity , we have to remove this bias .",
    "this is achieved if the mean multiplicity of reconstructed dipions is as closely as possible the same for the various systems .",
    "to this end one should tune appropriately the size of the kinematical window in ( [ eq : epswin ] ) .",
    "one can show @xcite that when the mean number of reconstructed dipions decreases the relative weight of critical to non - critical dipions in the reconstructed events increases .",
    "however , decreasing the multiplicity in general worsens the statistics and an optimization with respect to the choice of @xmath81 in ( [ eq : epswin ] ) is in order depending on the particular data set considered .",
    "this optimization procedure has also to take into account the limited experimental invariant - mass resolution @xmath82 which restricts the kinematical window @xmath83 accordingly ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the critical sigmas , as explained in the introduction , are expected to have an invariant - mass distribution peaked at the two - pion threshold .",
    "since the number of critical sigmas within the kinematical domain ( [ eq : epswin ] ) is crucial for the efficient reconstruction of the power - law discussed above , one has to look for an interval with enhanced content in critical sigmas , scanning for this purpose an extended kinematical range of dipion invariant mass .",
    "this is achieved by varying @xmath48 in eq .",
