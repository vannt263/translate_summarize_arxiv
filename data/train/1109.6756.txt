    "the theoretical description of the phase separation of fluid mixtures is a long - standing problem with importance in many areas of soft matter physics such as , e.g. , the stability of molecular and colloidal solutions@xcite , the interactions between nanoparticles and macromolecules including novel phenomena such as casimir forces @xcite , as well as interfacial and confinement effects occurring in the presence of surfaces . indeed , even  simple \" mixtures consisting of spherical particles can display non - trivial phase behaviour including triple points and critical end points not present for one - component systems @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , even more complex behaviour is observed for particles with internal degrees of freedom such as magnetic particles @xcite and mixtures involving shape - anisotropic particles such as colloidal rods @xcite .    besides purely numerical approaches such as monte - carlo or molecular ( brownian ) dynamics computer simulations ,",
    "classical density functional theory ( dft ) has proved to be a very accurate tool for describing both the homogeneous phase behaviour of mixtures and , at least for simple models , also the inhomogeneous structure occurring at interfaces . the key quantity in dft is the one - particle density , which is obtained through minimization of a grand canonical free energy functional corresponding to the microscopic hamiltonian of the system @xcite .",
    "in addition to yielding the equilibrium phase diagram and microscopic fluid structure , dft techniques have been successfully used to calculate nucleation barriers for state points in the metastable region of the phase diagrams @xcite . based on the success of these approaches",
    ", it seems very tempting to use dft techniques also to tackle the _ non - equilibrium dynamics _ of the phase separation , including the growth of nuclei , the actual nucleation pathway and coarsening processes during spinodal decomposition .",
    "indeed , one motivation for studying the phase separation dynamics accompanying demixing transitions is their important role in the context of pattern formation and self - organization @xcite .",
    "traditionally , phase separation dynamics is studied using mesoscopic models involving equations of motion for coarse - grained order parameters @xcite .",
    "the advantage of addressing these topics using dft is that the latter allows one to establish the link between the macroscopic behaviour of the system to the microscopic hamiltonian , which is naturally incorporated via the excess helmholtz free energy functional . in the last few years",
    ", the first steps in these directions have already been made on the basis of the so - called dynamical density functional theory@xcite ( ddft ) , which consists of a generalized continuity equation for the one - body density distribution of a many - particle systems of overdamped ( brownian ) colloidal particles .",
    "recent applications of the ddft to phase separation kinetics include spinodal decomposition in spherical fluids @xcite and heterogeneous nucleation at solid surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , most of these studies have been devoted to simple fluids with no internal degrees of freedom .    in the present work ,",
    "we use both static and dynamic dft to explore the phase separation of one of the simplest examples of a mixtures with internal degrees of freedom , that is , a binary fluid of spherical particles where one species carries a classical , ( 3d ) heisenberg spin .",
    "heisenberg fluids @xcite are basic models for continuum systems exhibiting ferromagnetic order , particularly for the description of ferromagnetism in undercooled liquid metal alloys .",
    "mixtures of such systems and , in particular , mixtures of magnetic and nonmagnetic particles are promising candidates for the controlled fabrication of patterns on the micron scale @xcite . moreover , an obvious attractive feature of these systems is that the phase separation and thus , the occurrence of patterns can be tuned by external magnetic fields .    from the theoretical side , the equilibrium properties of one - component heisenberg fluids @xcite , as well as other spin fluids with two - dimensional ( xy ) and ising spins and mixtures",
    "thereof have been extensively studied by mc simulations , integral equation methods , and ( mean field ) density functional theories ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "however , this microscopic level of description for the dynamic behaviour is essentially unexplored . as a starting point to fill this gap we consider here a heisenberg mixture in two spatial dimensions in the absence of an external field .",
    "the restriction to a 2d situation is actually close to many experiments ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and has the advantage that the calculated structure can be easily visualized . within the vast parameter space characterizing our model ,",
    "we focus on a situation where the system demixes into a non - magnetic and a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "for this situation , we first use conventional ( static ) dft to calculate a complete phase diagram ( involving a first - order transition and a tricritical point ) , as well as the inhomogeneous fluid density and magnetization profiles characterizing the liquid interface . based on this information",
    "we then consider the phase separation dynamics , focussing on the nucleation of non - magnetic bubbles within the ferromagnetic liquid phase .",
    "for this problem , we compare the results of three different approaches , namely classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) , which is based on macroscopic concepts , an approach based on equilibrium dft , and finally ddft .",
    "we demonstrate that both dft approaches yield consistent results for the nucleation barriers , but predict different pathways due to the fact that the ddft conserves the densities ( contrary to dft ) .",
    "moreover , the dft nucleation barriers differ from the cnt predictions when the size of the critical nucleus becomes small",
    ". we also present evidence that the ddft can describe the coarsening process during spinodal decomposition .",

    ", one may consider forming ( circular , in 2d ) clusters of the new ( globally stable ) phase with radius @xmath175 , surrounded by the metastable bulk phase .",
    "one finds that the free energy as a function of @xmath175 initially increases , reaches a maximum at @xmath176 , the critical radius , and then decreases for @xmath177 .",
    "it is assumed that clusters of a given radius are randomly formed in the system by thermal fluctuations .",

    "thus , the excess free energy corresponding to the ` critical cluster ' , i.e.  the cluster with radius @xmath179 , is important , because this is the free energy barrier which must be surmounted for the phase separation to occur .",

    "the key assumption of cnt is that _ any _ cluster ( regardless of its actual size ) can be regarded as a macroscopic object with a homogeneous density ( and thus , pressure ) inside and outside its surface .",
    "moreover , interfacial curvature effects are typically neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "the free energy related to creation of a nucleus can be written as a sum of two terms : a negative contribution stemming from the difference of the ( bulk ) pressures inside and outside the nucleus , and a positive contribution related to the increase of surface free energy .",

    "the performance of ddft in this context is not yet fully understood ( see ref .  ) , contrary to with the static dft approaches mentioned above .",
    "one issue in this context is the fact that , within the ddft , the number densities are _ conserved _ quantities [ as reflected by the appearance of a divergence in front of the free energy derivative in eq .",

    "this is in contrast to traditional ( static ) dft approaches towards nucleation , where the fixed quantity is the chemical potential(s ) . in view of this subtle point , and given the rather plausible results from the dft approach described so far , it is an important question whether a different algorithm , and particularly the conserved dynamics implied by the ddft [ see eqs.([eq.34])-([ddftangle ] ) ] , yields consistent results .",
    "we recall that the ddft is constructed such that the density evolves towards a profile which minimizes the free energy ( one can prove that the free energy always decreases or remains constant under the time evolution of the ddft , unless the system is externally driven@xcite ) .",

    "this is a consequence of the fact that the initial profiles a - c correspond to different space - averaged densities .",
    "this stems from the fact that the ddft conserves the total densities , and so the final state emerging for subcritical clusters does not necessarily have chemical potentials equal to those chosen in the previous dft calculations .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the demixing phase transition of a binary mixture of magnetic and non - magnetic soft - core particles from both a static and a dynamic point of view . to this end",
    "we have employed classical equilibrium dft as well as the recently developed ddft@xcite , a time - dependent extension of dft involving a generalized continuity equation for the density .",
    "our analysis of the equilibrium phase behavior of the system shows that the magnetic ( heisenberg ) interaction within one species is capable of inducing macroscopic phase separation .",
    "more precisely , for sufficiently large ferromagnetic coupling strength we find a combined phase transition where the system both demixes and develops global ferromagnetic ordering in one of the phases .",
    "depending on the total density , the transition may either be second or first order ( in terms of the magnetization and composition , respectively ) , with the two regimes being separated by a tricritical point .",
    "thus , the general topology of the phase diagram ( in the fluid regime ) , particularly the appearance of a curie line and a tricritical point , coincides with that of 3d heisenberg and xy - fluids@xcite . based on dft",
    "we have also calculated the structure of the fluid - fluid interface in the first - order regime , i.e.  we calculate the density and magnetization profiles , as well as the resulting interfacial ( line ) tension .",
    "as expected , the latter vanishes upon approaching the tricritical point from the high - density side .",
    "we note that the present dft results are based on a mean - field ( mf ) approximation for the excess free energy contribution from both the soft - core repulsion ( where mf theory has already proven to be very accurate@xcite ) and from the heisenberg interactions .",
    "thus , the quantitative reliability of our results remain to be checked against those of more refined free energy functionals and/or computer simulations .",
    "however , judging from previous theoretical studies of 3d heisenberg fluids@xcite we would expect the mf results to be quite good .",
    "the second part of the paper has been devoted to the dynamics of the ( first - order ) phase separation , concentrating mainly on the nucleation of non - magnetic clusters within the metastable ferromagnetic phase .",

    "the simplest one is cnt , a macroscopic approach , involving the bulk pressure and line tension .",
    "the resulting nucleation barriers show familiar behavior ( as compared to other model systems@xcite ) and predicts that the barrier height increases as one approaches to the binodal . in this regime cnt",
    "is expected to give a good approximation for @xmath194 .",

    "calculates the free energy as function of an appropriate ",
    "reaction coordinate \" , which we set to the excess number of particles in the nucleus .",
    "the results for the nucleation barrier are very similar to those from cnt when the fluid state point is near to the binodal .",
    "however , in contrast to cnt , the dft predicts that the nucleation barriers vanishes upon approaching the spinodal , as one should expect on physical grounds .",
    "finally , we have touched the issue of the nucleation pathway by comparing the results of the microscopic dft with those from ddft .",
    "since both of these approaches are based on the same free energy functional , they are both probing the same underlying free energy landscape .",
    "the choice of reaction coordinate to some extent determines what regions of this landscape are accessed and what path to and from the saddle point are predicted .",
    "in addition , the ` dynamics ' inherent in each approach also determines this path .",
    "the ddft has a real ( physical ) dynamics , which conserves the total number of particles in the system , whilst in contrast the oxtoby ",
    "evans dft approach , which has a finite number of iterations starting from an initial guess , leads to having an effective ( unphysical ) dynamics , which does not conserve the number of particles .",
    "thus , the ddft is essentially a canonical theory , whereas the dft approach is more grand canonical in character . as we have shown , these subtleties are irrelevant for the actual height of the nucleation barrier , but yield marked differences when we consider the evolution of profiles away from that of the critical nucleus towards equilibrium .",
    "to our knowledge , these two dft approaches have not been directly compared before .",
    "what is clear is that more investigations must be done to understand in detail the role of ddft for the nucleation pathway , and more importantly which approach is the relevant one for determining the true mlp .",
    "there are several directions which we believe require further investigation .",
    "first , as a direct extension of the present work , it would be interesting to consider in more detail the spinodal decomposition occurring in the unstable range of the phase diagram .",
    "our results in the present study already indicate that the ddft is capable of describing the coarsening process characterizing this regime in a qualitative way ( see sec .",
    "however , this issue clearly calls for a more systematic investigation including a ( linear ) stability analysis@xcite and also an investigation of dynamic correlations such as the time - dependent structure factor .",
    "this quantity may be obtained using recent extensions of the ddft to determine dynamical two - particle correlation functions@xcite .",
    "another ( maybe more technical ) open point concerns the effect of the actual formulation of the ddft . in the present study",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a simplified version where the spin degrees of freedom relax instantaneously ; therefore , we were essentially dealing with the ddft equations for isotropic particles , and the magnetization entered only via the selfconsistency relation for the ( local ) magnetization .",
    "however , to further proceed one should also explore results from the full ddft for anisotropic particles , which involves an equation for the rotational dynamics on top of that of the translational dynamics@xcite . a particular interesting question in this context concerns the role of different time scales of rotational and translational motion for the demixing dynamics .",
    "finally , it should be interesting to extend the present study towards 2d ( magnetic ) systems exposed to _ patterned _ surfaces and , optionally , additional external magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , a number of recent experiments@xcite have addressed the question of phase behavior and transport of magnetic particles on complex substrates@xcite .",
    "all these question can be , in principle , tackled by the present ( d)dft approach .",

    "<S> based on classical density functional theory ( dft ) , we investigate the demixing phase transition of a two - dimensional , binary heisenberg fluid mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the particles in the mixture are modeled as gaussian soft spheres , where one component is characterized by an additional classical spin - spin interaction of heisenberg type . within the dft we treat the particle interactions using a mean - field approximation . for certain magnetic coupling strengths we calculate phase diagrams in the density - concentration plane . for sufficiently large coupling strengths and densities , </S>",
    "<S> we find a demixing phase transition driven by the ferromagnetic interactions of the magnetic species . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a microscopic description ( i.e. , density profiles ) of the resulting non - magnetic / magnetic fluid - fluid interface . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the phase separation using dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) , considering both nucleation processes and spinodal demixing . </S>"
