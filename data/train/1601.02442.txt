    "the mean curvature flow of a compact hypersurface necessarily develops a singularity in finite time . at that point",
    "the classical solution ceases to exist and several so - called weak solutions have been defined that allow the evolution to be extended .",
    "one such example is level - set flow ( see section 2 for a definition ) , which was first investigated independently by chen - giga - goto  @xcite and evans - spruck  @xcite .",
    "level - set flow exists for _ any _ compact initial data and agrees with smooth mean curvature flow whenever the latter is defined .",
    "while the main use of level - set flow is certainly to analyze and flow through singularities it is nevertheless interesting to consider nonsmooth initial data which do no occur in this context . in this paper",
    "we study the level - set flow of the standard topologist s sine curve , which we denote by @xmath0 . for any given @xmath1 elementary geometric arguments",
    "can be used to show that @xmath0 has lebesgue measure zero and that the complement of @xmath0 has two connected components . however",
    ", these arguments can not rule out the possibility that the characteristic topological properties of the topologist s sine curve are preserved .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following :    [ main ] @xmath0 is a unique smooth curve shortening flow for @xmath1 .",
    "in fact what we show here is that @xmath0 instantly becomes locally - connected . at that point",
    "we make use of the classification proved by the second author in  @xcite .",
    "one restatement of that result is the following :    [ lauer](@xcite , theorem 1.1 ) let @xmath2 be locally - connected , connected and compact .",
    "then for each  @xmath1 , @xmath3 is a ( perhaps empty ) finite union of smooth closed curves .    in theorem",
    "[ lauer ] there are essentially three possibilities : the first is that @xmath4 instantly evolves as a smooth closed curve , the second is that @xmath4 is a positive area set with smooth boundary and the third is that @xmath4 vanishes instantly .    the question of nonsmooth initial data for mean curvature flow has been studied extensively : ecker and huisken  @xcite first proved that lipschitz entire graphs have a smooth evolution and later  @xcite showed that the same is true for curves that satisfy a uniform local lipschitz condition . in her thesis ,",
    "clutterbuck  @xcite proved the existence of a smooth evolution for bounded graphs which were merely continuous . in",
    "@xcite the case of planar curves was studied . there",
    "the first examples were given of sets with hausdorff dimension @xmath5 1 ( the koch snowflake for example ) that evolve to be smooth under level - set flow .",
    "more recently hershkovits  @xcite has given the first examples of this behaviour in arbitrary dimensions by studying @xmath6-reifenberg sets for  @xmath7  sufficiently small .",
    "in this section we give an outline of the proof of theorem  [ main ] . as usual when studying nonsmooth initial data for a parabolic pde the proof proceeds by establishing uniform estimates on a sequence of smooth approximations .",
    "we begin by defining the initial data :    [ topologist s sine curve ] a topologist s sine curve @xmath8 is the union of the graph of @xmath9 for @xmath10 , the line segment @xmath11 $ ] , and a smooth arc ( disjoint from the first two pieces except at its endpoints ) connecting these two pieces",
    ". see figure 1 .",
    "[ tscpic ]     the exact definition , i.e. how much of the graph @xmath9 is taken and which arc is used to connect the end of it back to @xmath12 , is not important . indeed",
    ", it will be clear from the argument that theorem  [ main ] is valid for any diffeomorphic image of @xmath8 as long as the compactifying segment remains linear .",
    "in section  [ sec_lsfdef ] we recall that the level - set flow of @xmath8 is determined by two sequences of smooth approximations , one contained in each of the two components of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be one such sequence .",
    "since  @xmath14 is chosen so as to hausdorff converge to @xmath8 it follows that the lengths , denoted @xmath15 , are unbounded . indeed , this is even true locally for @xmath16 . in that case for any @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the main step in the proof of theorem  [ main ] is showing that the supremum above is finite if one evolves the approximations simultaneously for a short time .",
    "namely , we prove the following :    [ tsc ] for each @xmath20 and @xmath21 , there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath23    and since the @xmath7 in theorem  [ tsc ] does not depend on @xmath24 the following corollary is immediate :    [ boundapprox ] for each @xmath1 @xmath25    in section 5 we show that corollary  [ boundapprox ] implies that @xmath26 for @xmath1 , where @xmath27 denotes the hausdorff 1-measure , and hence that @xmath28 is locally - connected ( see for example  @xcite ) . by theorem  [ lauer ]",
    "this implies that @xmath28 is smooth . at this point",
    "we have essentially proved the existence portion of theorem  [ main ] but have made no claim of uniqueness as it is _ a priori _ possible the boundary components defined by the two sequences of approximations are distinct .",
    "but theorem  [ main ] then follows from the observation , see lemma  [ measure ] , that @xmath0 has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ tsc ] requires two separate arguments . for @xmath29 the conclusion of theorem  [ tsc ]",
    "holds at @xmath30 and a simple argument counting intersections with a grid of static transverse lines shows that the uniform finiteness persists .    for @xmath16 the argument is more involved . in this case",
    "we instead count intersections with a translating solution to curve shortening flow , the so - called grim reaper .",
    "we choose the initial data @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and yet @xmath33 passes through  @xmath12 before time  @xmath34 .",
    "this can be done since by parabolic scaling one can construct a grim reaper which is arbitrarily thin , and hence arbitrarily fast .",
    "see figure 2 .    in lemma  [ intersect ]",
    "we show that @xmath35 , and hence @xmath36 are bounded and use the fact that the number of intersections is non - increasing under curve shortening flow to conclude that @xmath37 is also uniformly bounded .",
    "we then choose @xmath17 small enough so that the subset of @xmath31 that passes through @xmath38 is nearly horizontal . at @xmath34",
    "we have that @xmath39 has a bounded number of intersections with each leaf in two transverse foliations of @xmath38 .",
    "the vertical foliation is exactly linear while the horizontal one is @xmath40-close to linear .",
    "the result then follows since the bi - lipschitz constant needed to map the pair of foliations to the standard grid is well - controlled .",
    "[ grimreaper ]   in its convex hull .",

    "there is behaviour very different from smooth flows , the classic example being the figure eight which instantly _ fattens _ into a smooth region with three boundary components .",
    "fattening in this context should be interpreted as non - uniqueness .    in @xmath48",
    "the uniform existence of solutions to curve shortening flow , i.e. that the extinction time is proportional to the area bounded by the initial data , allows for a simple explicit definition .",

    ". then for each @xmath1 and @xmath69 define @xmath70 to be the smooth annulus with boundary @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the evolution of @xmath63 and @xmath64 by cuve shortening flow .",
    "we then have the following :    [ lsf ] for all @xmath1 @xmath74    since @xmath75 the definition of weak - set flow implies @xmath76 for each @xmath1 and hence that @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand it is easily checked that @xmath78 is itself a weak - set flow , which provides the opposite containment .",
    "the same construction can be used to determine the level - set flow of an arbitrary compact set . in that case",
    "there is one approximating sequence in each component of @xmath79 . in order to generalize lemma  [ lsf ] to higher dimensions one must first produce curvature bounds that imply that the evolution of such sequences exist on a uniform time interval .    using lemma  [ lsf ]",
    "it is easy to prove that the evolution of the topologist s sine curve has lebesguse measure zero , which in particular implies that @xmath0 does not fatten .",

    "thus @xmath84 for each @xmath1 and the result follows by lemma  [ lsf ] .    in general the sequences @xmath72 and @xmath73 may have distinct hausdorff limits . indeed this happens in the case of a positive area jordan curve which instantly evolves into a smooth annulus  @xcite . in the case of the topologist s sine curve",
    "we show that each sequence limits onto a smooth curve and so lemma  [ measure ] implies that the two limits coincide .      for the remainder of the paper we work with a sequence satisfying the following properties :    [ goodapprox ] [ allowable approximations][goodapprox ] for the topologist s sine curve @xmath85",
