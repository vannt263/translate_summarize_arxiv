    "star and planet formation are connected through disks .",
    "disk formation , long thought to be a trivial consequence of angular momentum conservation during core collapse and star formation ( e.g. , bodenheimer1995 ) , turned out to be much more complicated than originally envisioned .",
    "the complication comes from magnetic fields , which are observed in dense , star - forming , cores of molecular clouds ( see crutcher2012 for a recent review ) .",
    "the field can strongly affect the angular momentum evolution of core collapse and disk formation through magnetic braking .",
    "there have been a number of studies aiming at quantifying the effects of magnetic field on disk formation . in the ideal mhd limit",
    ", both analytic considerations and numerical simulations have shown that the formation of a rotationally supported disk ( rsd hereafter ) is suppressed by a realistic magnetic field ( corresponding to a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath4 a few ; trolandcrutcher2008 ) during the protostellar mass accretion phase in the simplest case of a non - turbulent core with the magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis ( allen+2003 ; galli+2006 ; pricebate2007 ; mellonli2008 ; hennebellefromang2008 ; dappbasu2010 ; seifried+2011 ; santos - lima+2012 ) .",
    "the suppression of rsds by excessive magnetic braking is termed `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' in star formation .",
    "rotationally supported disks are routinely observed , however , around evolved class ii young stellar objects ( see williamscieza2011 for a review ) , and increasingly around class i ( e.g. , jorgensen+2009 ; lee2011 ; takakuwa+2012 ) and even one class 0 source ( tobin+2012 ) .",
    "when and how such disks form in view of the magnetic braking catastrophe is unclear .",
    "the current attempts to overcome the catastrophic braking fall into three categories : ( 1 ) non - ideal mhd effects , including ambipolar diffusion , ohmic dissipation and hall effect , ( 2 ) misalignment between magnetic and rotation axes , and ( 3 ) turbulence .",
    "ambipolar diffusion does not appear to weaken the braking enough to enable large - scale rsd formation under realistic conditions ( krasnopolskykonigl2002 ; mellonli2009 ; duffinpudritz2009 ; li+2011 ) .",
    "ohmic dissipation can produce small , au - scale , rsd in the early protostellar accretion phase ( machida+2010 ; dappbasu2010 ; dapp+2012 ; tomida+2013 ) .",
    "larger , @xmath5-scale rsds can be produced if the resistivity or the hall coefficient of the dense core is much larger than the classical ( microscopic ) value ( krasnopolsky+2010,krasnopolsky+2011 ; see also braidingwardle2012a , braidingwardle2012b ) .",
    "@xcite explored the effects of tilting the magnetic field away from the rotation axis on disk formation ( see also machida+2006 ; pricebate2007 ; hennebelleciardi2009 ) .",
    "they concluded that keplerian disks can form for a mass - to - flux ratio @xmath6 as low as @xmath7 , as long as the tilt angle is close to @xmath2 ( see their fig .",
    "the effects of turbulence were explored by @xcite , who concluded that a strong enough turbulence can induce enough magnetic diffusion to enable the formation of a @xmath5-scale rsd . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered supersonically turbulent massive cores .",
    "they found rotationally dominated disks around low - mass stars , although in both cases the turbulence - induced rotation is misaligned with the initial magnetic field by a large angle , which may have contributed to the disk formation ( see also joos+2013 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to revisit the role of magnetic field - rotation misalignment in disk formation .",
    "the misalignment is expected if the angular momenta of dense cores are generated through turbulent motions ( e.g. , burkertbodenheimer2000 ; myers+2012 ) .",
    "it is also inferred from the misalignment between the field direction traced by polarized dust emission and the outflow axis , which is taken as a proxy for the direction of rotation ( hull+2012 ) .",
    "indeed , in the carma sample of @xcite , the distribution of the angle @xmath8 between the magnetic field and jet / rotation axis is consistent with being random .",
    "if true , it would indicate that in half of the sources the two axes are misaligned by a large angle of @xmath9 ( see however chapman+2013 and discussion in  [ disk ] )",
    ". such a large misalignment would be enough to allow disk formation in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level ( with @xmath6 of a few ; trolandcrutcher2008 ) according to @xcite .",
    "if the alignment angle @xmath8 is indeed random and @xcite s conclusions are generally true , the magnetic braking catastrophe would be largely solved .",
    "given their far - reaching implications , it is prudent to check @xcite s conclusions , using a different numerical code",
    ". it is the task of this paper .",
    "we carry out numerical experiments of disk formation in dense cores with misaligned magnetic and rotation axes using non - ideal mhd code zeus - tw that includes self - gravity .",
    "we find that a large misalignment angle does indeed enable the formation of rsds in weakly magnetized dense cores with dimensionless mass - to - flux ratios @xmath1 , but not in dense cores magnetized to higher , more typical levels .",
    "our conclusion is that while the misalignment helps with disk formation , especially in relatively weakly magnetized cores , it may not provide a complete resolution to the magnetic braking catastrophe by itself .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  [ setup ] , we describe the model setup .",
    "the numerical results are described in  [ misalignment ] and  [ strong ] .",
    "we compare our results to those of @xcite and discuss their implications in  [ discussion ] and conclude with a short summary in  [ summary ] .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and start our simulations from a uniform , spherical core of @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 in a spherical coordinate system @xmath12 .",
    "the initial density @xmath13 corresponds to a molecular hydrogen number density of @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state with a sound speed @xmath15 below a critical density @xmath16 , and a polytropic equation of state @xmath17 above it . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "we impose a solid - body rotation of angular speed @xmath18 on the core , with axis along the north pole ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a ratio of rotational to gravitational binding energy of 0.025 , which is typical of the values inferred for nh@xmath20 cores ( goodman+1993 ) .",
    "the initial magnetic field is uniform , tilting away from the rotation axis by an angle @xmath8 .",
    "we consider three values for the initial field : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio , in units of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , for the core as a whole .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio for the central flux tube @xmath28 is higher than the global value @xmath6 by @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the three cases respectively .",
    "the effective mass - to - flux ratio @xmath33 should lie between these two limits .",
    "if the star formation efficiency per core is @xmath34 ( e.g. , alves+2007 ) , then one way to estimate @xmath33 is to consider the ( cylindrical ) magnetic flux surface that encloses @xmath35 of the core mass , which yields @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for the three cases respectively ; the fraction @xmath35 is also not far from the typical fraction of core mass that has accreted onto the central object at the end of our simulations ( see table  1 ) . for the tilt angle",

    "the radial cell size is smallest near the inner boundary ( @xmath50 or @xmath51 ) .",
    "it increases outward by a constant factor @xmath52 between adjacent cells . in the polar direction , we choose a relatively large cell size ( @xmath53 ) near the polar axes , to prevent the azimuthal cell size from becoming prohibitively small ; it decreases smoothly to a minimum of @xmath54 near the equator , where rotationally supported disks may form .",
    "the grid is uniform in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction are periodic . in the radial direction , we impose the standard outflow boundary conditions .",
    "material leaving the inner radial boundary is collected as a point mass ( protostar ) at the center .",

    "the boundary condition is chosen to be reflective .",
    "although this is not strictly valid , we expect its effect to be limited to a small region near the axis .",
    "we initially intended to carry out simulations in the ideal mhd limit , so that they can be compared more directly with other work , especially @xcite .",
    "however , ideal mhd simulations tend to produce numerical `` hot zones '' that force the calculation to stop early in the protostellar mass accretion phase , a tendency we noted in our previous 2d ( mellonli2008 ) and 3d simulations ( krasnopolsky+2012 ) .",
    "to lengthen the simulation , we include a small , spatially uniform resistivity @xmath55 .",
    "we have verified that , in the particular case model g ( @xmath56 and @xmath43 ) , this resistivity changes the flow structure little compared to either the ideal mhd model m ( before the latter stops ) or model n , where the resistivity is reduced by a factor 10 , to @xmath57 .",
    "to illustrate the effect of the misalignment between the magnetic field direction and rotation axis , we first consider an extreme case where the magnetic field is rather weak ( with a mass - to - flux ratio @xmath56 for the core as a whole and @xmath58 for the inner @xmath35 of the core mass ) . in this case ,",
    "a well - formed rotationally supported disk is present in the orthogonal case with @xmath43 ( model g in table  1 ) .",
    "such a disk is absent in the aligned case ( with @xmath40 , model a ) . the contrast is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ contrast ] , where we plot snapshots of the aligned and orthogonal cases at a representative time @xmath59 , when a central mass of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , has formed .",
    "the flow structures in the two cases are very different in both the equatorial ( panels [ a ] and [ b ] ) and meridian ( panels [ c ] and [ d ] ) plane . in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the aligned case has a relatively large ( with radius @xmath62 ) over - dense region where material spirals rapidly inward .",
    "on the ( smaller ) scale of @xmath63 , the structure is dominated by expanding , low - density lobes ; they are the decoupling enabled magnetic structures ( dems for short ) that have been studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "no rotationally supported disk is evident .",
    "the equatorial structure on the @xmath64 scale in the orthogonal case is dominated by a pair of spirals instead .",
    "the spirals merge , on the @xmath63 scale , into a more or less continuous , rapidly rotating structure  a rotationally supported disk .",
    "clearly , the accretion flow in the orthogonal case was able to retain more angular momentum than in the aligned case .",
    "why is this the case ?",
    "a clue comes from the meridian view of the two cases ( panels [ c ] and [ d ] of fig .",
    "[ contrast ] ) . in the aligned case",
    ", there is a strong bipolar outflow extending beyond @xmath65 at the relatively early time shown .",
    "the outflow forces most of the infalling material to accrete through a flattened equatorial structure  an over - dense pseudodisk ( gallishu1993 ; see panel [ a ] for a face - on view of the pseudodisk , noting the difference in scale between panel [ c ] and [ a ] ) .",
    "it is the winding of the magnetic field lines by the rotating material in the pseudodisk that drives the bipolar outflow in the first place .",
    "the wound - up field lines act back on the pseudodisk material , braking its rotation .",
    "it is the efficient magnetic braking in the pseudodisk that makes it difficult for rotationally supported disks to form in the aligned case .",
    "the prominent bipolar outflow indicative of efficient magnetic braking is absent in the orthogonal case , as was emphasized by @xcite .",
    "it is replaced by a much smaller , shell - like structure inside which the @xmath63-scale rotationally supported disk is encased ( panel [ d ] ) . to understand this difference in flow structure pictorially , we plot in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] the three - dimensional structure of the magnetic field lines on the scale of @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) , which is @xmath29 larger than the size of panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ contrast ] , but half of that of panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "clearly , in the aligned case , the relatively weak initial magnetic field ( corresponding to @xmath68 ) has been wound up many turns by the material in the equatorial pseudodisk , building up a magnetic pressure in the equatorial region that is released along the polar directions ( see the first panel of fig .",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient drives a bipolar outflow , which is evident in panel ( c ) and in many previous simulations of magnetized core collapse , including the early ones such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the orthogonal case , the equatorial region is no longer the region of the magnetically induced pseudodisk . in the absence of rotation ( along the @xmath42-axis ) , the dense core material would preferentially contract along the field lines ( that are initially along the @xmath44-axis ) to form a dense sheet in the @xmath69-@xmath42 plane that passes through the origin .",
    "the twisting of this sheet by rotation along the @xmath42-axis produces two curved `` curtains '' that spiral smoothly into the disk at small distances , somewhat analogous in shape to two snail - shells ( see the second panel of fig .",
    "[ 3d ] ) .",
    "the snail - shaped dense curtain in the orthogonal case naturally explains the morphology of the density maps shown in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ contrast ] .",
    "first , the two prominent spiral arms in the panel ( a ) are simply the equatorial ( @xmath44-@xmath69 ) cut of the curved curtains . an interesting feature of the spirals ( and the snail - shaped dense curtain as a whole ) is that they are the region where the magnetic field lines change directions sharply .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pinch ] , which is similar to panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ contrast ] , except that the magnetic vectors ( rather than velocity vectors ) are plotted on top of the density map .",
    "clearly , the spirals separate the field lines rotating counter clock - wise ( lower - right part of the figure ) from those rotating close - wise ( upper - left ) .",
    "the sharp kink is analogous to the well - known field line kink across the equatorial pseudodisk in the aligned case , where the radial component of the magnetic field changes direction .",
    "it supports our interpretation of the spirals and , by extension , the curtain as a magnetically induced feature , as is the case of pseudodisk . in other words ,",
    "the spirals are not produced by gravitational instability in a rotationally supported structure ; they are `` pseudospirals '' in the same sense as the `` pseudodisks '' of @xcite .",
    "the field line kinks are also evident across the dense curtain in the 3d structure shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ 3d ] .",
    "the 3d topology of the magnetic field and the dense structures that it induces lie at the heart of the difference in the magnetic braking efficiency between the aligned and orthogonal case .",
    "in particular , a flattened , rotating , equatorial pseudodisk threaded by an ordered magnetic field with an appreciable vertical component ( along the rotation axis ) is more conducive to driving an outflow than a warped curtain with a magnetic field predominantly tangential to its surface .",
    "the outflow plays a key role in angular momentum removal and the suppression of rotationally supported disks , as we demonstrate next .      to quantify the outflow effect",
    ", we follow @xcite ( @xcite ; see also joos+2012 ) and compare the rates of angular momentum change inside a finite volume @xmath70 through its surface @xmath71 due to infall and outflow to that due to magnetic torque .",
    "the total magnetic torque relative to the origin ( from which a radius vector @xmath72 is defined ) is @xmath73\\,dv,\\ ] ] where the integration is over the volume @xmath70 .",
    "typically , the magnetic torque comes mainly from the magnetic tension rather than pressure force .",
    "the dominant magnetic tension term can be simplified to a surface integral ( matsumototomisaka2004 ) @xmath74 over the surface @xmath71 of the volume .",
    "this volume - integrated magnetic torque is to be compared with the rate of angular momentum advected into the volume through fluid motion , @xmath75 which will be referred to as the advective torque below .",
    "since the initial angular momentum of the dense core is along the @xmath42-axis , we will be mainly concerned with the @xmath42-component of the magnetic and advective torque which , for a spherical volume inside radius @xmath76 , are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 the advective torque consists of two parts : the rates of angular momentum advected into and out of the sphere by infall and outflow respectively : @xmath79 and @xmath80    an example of the magnetic and advective torques is shown in fig .  [ torque ] .",
    "the torques are evaluated on spherical surfaces of different radii , at the representative time @xmath59 . for the aligned case ,",
    "the net torque close to the central object is nearly zero up to a radius of @xmath81 , indicating that the angular momentum advected inward is nearly completely removed by magnetic braking there . at larger distances , between @xmath82 and @xmath62 ,",
    "the net torque @xmath83 is negative , indicating that the angular momentum of the material inside a sphere of radius in this range decreases with time .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the orthogonal case , where the net torque is positive in that radial range , with the angular momentum there increasing ( rather than decreasing ) with time .",
    "one may think that the difference is mainly due to a significantly larger magnetic torque @xmath84 in the aligned case than in the orthogonal case .",
    "although this is typically the case at early times , the magnetic torques in the two cases become comparable at later times ( see the lowest solid lines in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ torque ] ; a movie of the torques is available on request from the authors ) .",
    "a bigger difference comes from the total ( or net ) angular momentum @xmath85 advected inward , which is substantially smaller in the aligned case than in the orthogonal case ( see the uppermost solid lines in the two panels ) .",
    "the main reason for the difference is that a good fraction of the angular momentum advected inward by infall @xmath86 is advected back out by outflow @xmath87 in the former , but not the latter .",
    "this is helped by the fact that @xmath86 is somewhat smaller in the aligned case to begin with ( compare the dotted lines in the two panels ) .",
    "the lack of appreciable outward advection of angular momentum by outflow , which is itself a product of field - winding and magnetic braking in the aligned case , appears to be the main reason for the orthogonal case to retain more angular momentum at small radii and form a rotationally supported disk in this particular case of relatively weak magnetic field .",
    "the formation of a rotationally supported disk can be seen most clearly in fig .",
    "[ rotation ] , where we plot the infall and rotation speed , as well as specific angular momentum as a function of radius along 4 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) directions in the equatorial plane . in the orthogonal case ,",
    "the infall and rotation speeds display the two tell - tale signs of rotationally supported disks : ( 1 ) a slow , subsonic ( although nonzero ) infall speed much smaller than the free fall value , and ( 2 ) a much faster rotation speed close to the keplerian value inside a radius of @xmath90 .",
    "the absence of a rotationally supported disk in the aligned case is just as obvious .",
    "it has a rotation speed well below the keplerian value and an infall speed close to the free fall value , especially at small radii up to @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to the region dominated by the low - density , strongly magnetized , expanding lobes ( i.e. , dems ; see panel [ a ] of fig  [ contrast ] ) where the angular momentum is almost completely removed by a combination of magnetic torque and outflow ( see the third panel in fig .",
    "[ rotation ] ) . also evident from the panel",
    "is that the specific angular momentum of the equatorial inflow drops significantly twice : near @xmath91 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the former corresponds to the dems - dominated region , and the latter the pseudodisk ( see panel [ a ] of fig .  [ contrast ] ) .",
    "the relatively slow infall inside the pseudodisk allows more time for magnetic braking to remove angular momentum .",
    "it is the pseudodisk ( and its associated outflow ) working in tandem with the dems that suppresses the formation of a rotationally supported disk in the aligned case .",
    "interestingly , there is a bump near @xmath62 for the specific angular momentum of the orthogonal case , indicating that the angular momentum in the equatorial plane is transported radially outward along the spiraling field lines from small to large distances ( see fig .",
    "[ pinch ] ) .",
    "the spiraling equatorial field lines in the orthogonal model g have an interesting property : they consist of two strains of opposite polarity .",
    "as the strains get wound up more and more tightly by rotation at smaller and smaller radii , field lines of opposite polarity are pressed closer and closer together , creating a situation that is conducive to reconnection , either of physical or numerical origin ( see the first panel of fig .",
    "[ magnetic ] ) .",
    "model g contains a small but finite resistivity ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it does not appear to be responsible for the formation and survival of the keplerian disk , because a similar disk is also formed at the same ( relatively early ) time for a smaller resistivity of @xmath92 ( model n ) and even without any explicit resistivity ( model m ) .",
    "numerical resistivity may have played a role here , but it is difficult to quantify at the moment . in any case",
    ", the magnetic field on the keplerian disk appears to be rather weak , as can be seen from the second panel of fig .",
    "[ magnetic ] , where the plasma @xmath93 is plotted along 4 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) directions in the equatorial plane . on the keplerian disk in the orthogonal model g ( inside @xmath90 ) , @xmath93 is of order @xmath94 or more , indicating that there is more matter accumulating in the disk than magnetic field , either because the matter slides along the field lines into the disk ( increasing density but not the field strength ) or because of numerical reconnection that weakens the field , or both .",
    "this situation is drastically different from the aligned case , where the inner @xmath95 region is heavily influenced by the magnetically - dominated low - density lobes .",
    "we have seen from the preceding section that , in the weakly magnetized case of @xmath56 , the @xmath5-scale inner part of the protostellar accretion flow is dominated by two very different types of structures : a weakly magnetized , dense , rotationally supported disk ( rsd ) in the orthogonal case ( @xmath43 , model g ) and magnetically dominated , low - density lobes or dems in the aligned case ( @xmath40 , model a ) , at least at the relatively early time discussed in  [ misalignment ] , when the central mass reaches @xmath96 .",
    "this dichotomy persists to later times for these two models and for other models as well , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ all ] , where we plot models a  i at a time when the central mass reaches @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that the rsd for model g becomes even more prominent at the later time , although a small magnetically dominated , low - density lobe is evident close to the center of the disk : it is a trapped dems that is too weak to disrupt the disk . in this case",
    ", the identification of a robust rsd is secure , at even later times ( up to the end of the simulation , when the central mass reaches @xmath98 or @xmath99 of the initial core mass ) . in the aligned case ( model a )",
    ", the inner accretion flow remains dominated by the highly dynamic dems at late times , with no sign of rsd formation .    for the intermediate tilt angle case of @xmath100 ( model d ) , the inner structure of the protostellar accretion flow is shaped by the tussle between rsd and dems .",
    "[ all ] shows that , at the plotted time , model d has several spiral arms that appear to merge into a rotating disk .",
    "there are , however , at least three low - density `` holes '' near the center of the disk : they are the magnetically dominated dems .",
    "movies show that the highly variable dems are generally confined close to the center , although they can occasionally expand to occupy a large fraction of the disk surface .",
    "overall , the circumstellar structure in model d is more disk - like than dems - like . we shall call it a `` porous disk , '' to distinguish it from the more filled - in , more robust disk in the orthogonal model g. even though most of the porous disk has a rotation speed dominating the infall speed , the infall is highly variable , and often supersonic .",
    "the rotation speed also often deviates greatly from the keplerian value .",
    "such an erratic disk is much more dynamic than the quiescent disks envisioned around relatively mature ( e.g. , class ii ) ysos .",
    "the intermediate tilt angle case drives a powerful bipolar outflow , unlike the orthogonal case , but similar to the aligned case .",
    "this is consistent with the rate of angular momentum removal increasing with decreasing tilt angle ( i.e. , from @xmath2 to @xmath41 ; see also ciardihennebelle2010 ) .    as the strength of the initial magnetic field in the core increases ,",
    "the dems becomes more dominant .",
    "this is illustrated in the middle column of fig .",
    "[ all ] , where the three cases with an intermediate field strength corresponding to @xmath101 ( and @xmath102 ) are plotted . in model h , where the magnetic and rotation axes are orthogonal , a relatively small ( with radius of @xmath103 ) rotationally dominated disk is clearly present at the time shown .",
    "as in the weaker field case of model g , it is fed by prominent `` pseudo - spirals '' which are part of a magnetically - induced curtain in 3d ( see the second panel of fig .",
    "[ 3d ] ) . compared to model g",
    ", the curtain here is curved to a lesser degree , which is not surprising because the rotation is slower due to a more efficient braking and the stronger magnetic field embedded in the curtain is harder to bend .",
    "the disk is also smaller , less dense , and more dynamic .",
    "it is more affected by dems , which occasionally disrupt the disk , although it always reforms after disruption .",
    "overall , the circumstellar structure in model h is more rsd - like than dems - like . as in model d",
    ", we classify it as a `` porous disk . '' as the tilt angle decreases from @xmath2 to @xmath41 ( model e ) and further to @xmath104 ( model b ) , the rotationally dominated circumstellar structure largely disappears ; it is replaced by dems - dominated structures . even though there is still a significant amount of rotation in the accretion flow , a dense coherent disk",
    "is absent .",
    "we conclude that for a moderately strong magnetic field of @xmath101 the formation of rsd is suppressed if the tilt angle is moderate .    in the cases of the strongest magnetic field corresponding to @xmath105 ( and @xmath106 ) , the formation of rsd is suppressed regardless of the tilt angle , as can be seen from the last column of fig .  [ all ] . for the orthogonal case ( model i ) ,",
    "the prominent `` pseudo - spirals '' in the weaker field cases of model g ( @xmath56 ) and h ( @xmath101 ) are replaced by two arms that are only slightly bent .",
    "they are part of a well - defined pseudodisk that happens to lie roughly in the @xmath107 ( or @xmath44-@xmath42 ) plane ( see the second panel of fig .  [ 3db1e-5 ] ) . in the absence of any initial rotation",
    ", one would expect the pseudodisk to form perpendicular to the initial field direction along the @xmath44-axis , i.e. , in the @xmath108 ( or @xmath69-@xmath42 ) plane . over the entire course of core evolution and collapse ,",
    "the rotation has rotated the expected plane of the pseudodisk by nearly @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , at the time shown ( when the central mass reaches @xmath97 ) , there is apparently little rotation left inside @xmath109 to warp the pseudodisk significantly .",
    "except for the orientation , this pseudodisk looks remarkably similar to the familiar one in the aligned case ( model c ; see the first panel of fig .",
    "[ 3db1e-5 ] ) .",
    "in particular , there are low - density `` holes '' in the inner part of both pseudodisks which are threaded by intense magnetic fields and surrounded by dense filaments : they are the dems . in the intermediate tilt angle case of @xmath41 ( model f , not shown in the 3d figure ) , the pseudodisk is somewhat more warped than the two other cases , and its inner part is again dominated by dems .",
    "it is clear that for a magnetic field of @xmath6 of a few , the inner circumstellar structure is dominated by the magnetic field , with rotation playing a relatively minor role ; the rsd remains suppressed despite the misalignment .",
    "to better estimate the boundary between the cores that produce rsds and those that do not , we carried out two additional simulations with @xmath43 ( models p and q in table  1 ) .",
    "we found a porous disk in model p ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) , as in the weaker field case of model h , but no disk in model q ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , as in the stronger field case of model i. from this , we infer that the boundary lies approximately at @xmath114 ( or @xmath115 ) .",
    "our most important qualitative result is that the misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis tends to promote the formation of rotationally supported disks , especially in weakly magnetized dense cores .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusion previously reached by @xcite ( @xcite ; jhc12 hereafter ) , using a different numerical code and somewhat different problem setup .",
    "their calculations were carried out using an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code in the cartesian coordinate system , with the central object treated using a stiffening of the equation of state , whereas ours were done using a fixed mesh refinement ( fmr ) code in the spherical coordinate system , with an effective sink particle at the origin . despite the differences ,",
    "these two distinct sets of calculations yield qualitatively similar results .",
    "the case for the misalignment promoting disk formation is therefore strengthened .",
    "quantitatively , there appears to be a significant discrepancy between our results and theirs . according to their fig .",
    "14 , a keplerian disk is formed in the relatively strongly magnetized case of @xmath116 if the misalignment angle @xmath43 .",
    "formally , this case corresponds roughly to our model i ( @xmath105 and @xmath43 ) , for which we can rule out the formation of a rotationally supported disk with confidence ( see fig .  [ all ] ) .",
    "we believe that the discrepancy comes mostly from the initial density profile adopted , which affects the degree of magnetization near the core center for a given global mass - to - flux ratio @xmath6 . @xcite adopted a centrally condensed initial mass distribution @xmath117 with the characteristic radius @xmath118 set to @xmath35 of the core radius @xmath119 , so that the central - to - edge density contrast is 10 ( see also ciardihennebelle2010 ) .",
    "it is easy to show that , for this density profile and a uniform magnetic field , the mass - to - flux ratio for the flux tube passing through the origin is @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath6 is the global mass - to - flux ratio for the core as a whole .",
    "for @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 . in other words ,",
    "the central part of their core is substantially less magnetized relative to mass than the core as a whole , due to the initial mass condensation . for the @xmath116 case under consideration",
    ", we have @xmath124 , which makes the material on the central flux tube rather weakly magnetized ( relative to mass ) .",
    "the magnetization of the central region is important , because the central part is accreted first and the star formation efficiency in a core may not be 100% efficient ( e.g. , alves+2007 ) . if we define as in  [ setup ] an effective mass - to - flux ratio for the ( cylindrical ) magnetic flux surface that encloses @xmath35 of the core mass , then @xmath125 for the density distribution adopted by jhc12 ( equation [ [ profile ] ] ) .",
    "it is significantly different from the effective mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath36 for the uniform density that we adopted .",
    "the above difference in @xmath33 makes our strongest field case of @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) more directly comparable to jhc12 s @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) case .",
    "there is agreement that , in both cases , the formation of a rsd is suppressed , even when the tilt angle @xmath43 .",
    "these results suggest that rsd formation is suppressed when the effective mass - to - flux ratio @xmath128 , independent of the degree of field - rotation misalignment , consistent with the conclusion we reached toward the end of  [ strong ] based on models p and q.    similarly , jhc12 s @xmath116 ( @xmath129 ) models may be more directly comparable to our @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) models .",
    "our calculations show that a ( more or less ) rotationally supported disk is formed in the extreme @xmath43 case for @xmath102 ( model h , see fig .",
    "[ all ] ) but not in the intermediate tilt angle @xmath100 case ( model e ) .",
    "this is consistent with their fig .",
    "14 , where a keplerian disk is formed for @xmath43 for @xmath129 , but not for @xmath100 . in the latter case",
    ", jhc12 found a disk - like structure with a flat rather than keplerian rotation profile .",
    "they attributed the flat rotation to additional support from the magnetic energy , which dominates the kinetic energy at small radii .",
    "we believe that their high magnetic energy comes from strongly magnetized , low - density lobes ( i.e. , dems ) , which are clearly visible in our model e ( see fig .  [ all ] ) .",
    "although there is still significant rotation on the @xmath5 scale in model e , we find the morphology and kinematics of the circumstellar structure too disorganized to be called a `` disk . ''",
    "we conclude that for a moderate field strength corresponding to @xmath130@xmath131 , a rotationally supported disk does not form except when the magnetic field is tilted nearly orthogonal to the rotation axis .    our weak - field case of @xmath56 ( @xmath58 )",
    "can be compared with jhc12 s @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) case . in both cases ,",
    "a well - defined rotationally supported disk is formed when @xmath43 ( see our fig .  [ all ] and their fig .",
    "12 ) . for the intermediate tilt angle @xmath100",
    ", jhc12 obtained a disk - like structure with a flat rotation curve , with the magnetic energy dominating the kinetic energy at small radii .",
    "this is broadly consistent with our intermediate tilt angle model d , where a highly variable , `` porous '' disk is formed , with the central part often dominated by strongly magnetized , low - density lobes .",
    "there is also agreement that the disk formation is suppressed if @xmath134 even for such a weakly magnetized case .",
    "it therefore appears that , for the weak - field case of @xmath135 , a rotationally supported disk can be induced by a relatively moderate tilt angle of @xmath136 .",
    "the result that a misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis helps disk formation by weakening magnetic braking may be counter - intuitive .",
    "@xcite showed analytically that , for a uniform rotating cylinder embedded in a uniform static external medium , magnetic braking is much more efficient in the orthogonal case than in the aligned case .",
    "this analytic result may not be directly applicable to a collapsing core , however . as emphasized by jhc12 ,",
    "the collapse drags the initially uniform , rotation - aligned magnetic field into a configuration that fans out radially .",
    "jhc12 estimated analytically that the collapse - induced field fan - out could in principle make the magnetic braking in the aligned case more efficient than in the orthogonal case .",
    "the analytical estimate did not , however , take into account of the angular momentum removal by outflow , which , as we have shown in  [ torque ] , is a key difference between the weak - field ( @xmath56 , @xmath137 ) aligned case ( model a ) where disk formation is suppressed and its orthogonal counterpart ( model g ) that does produce a rotationally supported disk ( see figs .  [ contrast ] and [ torque ] , and also ciardihennebelle2010 ) .",
    "the generation of a powerful outflow in the weak - field aligned case ( model a ) is facilitated by the orientation of its pseudodisk , which is perpendicular to the rotation axis ( see fig .  [ 3d ] ) .",
    "this configuration is conducive to both the pseudodisk winding up the field lines and the wound - up field escaping above and below the pseudodisk , which drives a bipolar outflow .",
    "when the magnetic field is tilted by @xmath2 away from the rotation axis , the pseudodisk is warped by rotation into a snail - shaped curtain that is unfavorable to outflow driving ( see fig .",
    "the outflow makes it more difficult to form a rotationally supported disk in the aligned case .",
    "disk formation is further hindered by magnetically dominated , low - density lobes ( dems ) , which affect the inner part of the accretion flow of the aligned case more than that of the perpendicular case , at least when the field is relatively weak ( see fig .",
    "[ contrast ] and [ all ] ) . for more strongly magnetized cases ,",
    "the dems becomes more dynamically important close to the central object , independent of the tilt angle @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ 3db1e-5 ] ) . dems - like structures",
    "were also seen in some runs of jhc12 ( e.g. , the case of @xmath126 and @xmath40 ; see their fig .",
    "19 ) but were not commented upon . as stressed previously by @xcite and @xcite and confirmed by our calculations , the dems presents a formidable obstacle to the formation and survival of a rotationally supported disk .",
    "while there is agreement between jhc12 and our calculations that misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis is beneficial to disk formation , it is unlikely that the misalignment alone can enable disk formation around the majority of young stellar objects .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "@xcite obtained a mean dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath138 through oh zeeman observations for a sample of dense cores in nearby dark clouds near the center relative to that in the envelope . ] .",
    "for such a small @xmath33 , disk formation is completely suppressed , even for the case of maximum misalignment of @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite argued , however , that there is a flat distribution of the total field strength in dense cores , from @xmath139 to some maximum value @xmath140 ; the latter corresponds to @xmath141 , so that the mean @xmath142 stays around 2 .",
    "if this is the case , some cores could be much more weakly magnetized than others , and disks could form preferentially in these cores . however , to form a rotationally supported disk , the core material must have ( 1 ) an effective mass - to - flux ratio @xmath33 greater than about 5 _ and _ ( 2 ) a rather large tilt angle ( see discussion in the preceding section ) . if one assumes that the core - to - core variation of @xmath33 comes mostly from the field strength rather than the column density ( as done in crutcher+2010 ) , then the probability of a core having @xmath143 ( or @xmath144 ) is @xmath145 . since a large tilt angle of @xmath146",
    "is required to form a rsd for @xmath130@xmath131 , the chance of disk formation is reduced from @xmath145 by at least a factor of 2 ( assuming a random orientation of the magnetic field relative to the rotation axis ) , to @xmath147 or less .    the above estimate is necessarily rough , and can easily be off by a factor of two in either direction .",
    "it is , however , highly unlikely for the majority of the cores to simultaneously satisfy the conditions on both @xmath33 and @xmath8 for disk formation .",
    "the condition @xmath143 is especially difficult to satisfy because , as noted earlier , it implies that the dense cores probed by oh observations must have a total field strength @xmath148 , less than or comparable to the well - defined median field strength inferred by @xcite for the much more diffuse , cold neutral _ atomic _ medium ( cnm ) .",
    "it is hard to imagine a reasonable scenario in which the majority of dense cores have magnetic fields weaker than the cnm .",
    "we note that @xcite independently estimated a range of @xmath149@xmath29 for the fraction of dense cores that would produce a keplerian disk based on fig .  14 of jhc12 .",
    "their lower limit of @xmath147 is in agreement with our estimate ; in both cases , the fraction is dominated by weakly magnetized cores that have mass - to - flux ratios greater than @xmath150 and moderately large tilt angles .",
    "their upper limit of @xmath151 is much higher than our estimate , mainly because it includes rather strongly magnetized cores with mass - to - flux ratios as small as @xmath152 .",
    "since our calculations show that such strongly magnetized cores do not produce rotationally supported disks even for large tilt angles , we believe that this upper limit may be overly generous .",
    "whether dense cores have large tilt angle @xmath8 between the magnetic field and rotation axis that are conducive to disk formation is unclear .",
    "@xcite measured the field orientation on the @xmath109-scale for a sample of 16 sources using millimeter interferometer carma .",
    "they found that the field orientation is not tightly correlated with the outflow axis ; indeed , the angle between the two is consistent with being random . if the outflow axis is aligned with the core rotation axis and if the field orientation is the same on the core scale as on the smaller , @xmath109-scale , then @xmath8 would be randomly distributed between @xmath153 and @xmath2 , with half of the sources having @xmath154 . however , the outflow axis may not be representative of the core rotation axis .",
    "this is because the ( fast ) outflow is thought to be driven magnetocentrifugally from the inner part of the circumstellar disk ( on the au - scale or less ; shu+2000 ; koniglpudritz2000 ) .",
    "a parcel of core material would have lost most of its angular momentum on the way to the outflow launching location ; the torque ( most likely magnetic or gravitational ) that removes the angular momentum may also change the direction of the rotation axis . similarly , the field orientation on the @xmath109-scale may not be representative of the initial field orientation on the larger core scale .",
    "the magnetic field on the @xmath109 scale is more prone to distortion by collapse and rotation than that on the core scale .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the field orientation on the core scale measured using single - disk telescope cso is within @xmath155 of the outflow axis for 3 of the 4 sources in their sample ; the larger angle measured in the remain source may be due projection effects because its outflow axis is close to the line - of - sight .",
    "if the result of @xcite is valid in general and if the outflow axis reflects the core rotation axis , then dense cores with large tilt angle @xmath8 would be rare . in this case",
    ", disk formation would be rare according to the calculations presented in this paper and in jhc12 , even in the unlikely event that the majority of dense cores are as weakly magnetized as @xmath143 .",
    "rotationally supported disks are observed , however , routinely around evolved class ii ysos ( see williamscieza2011 for a recent review ) , and increasingly around younger class i ( e.g. , jorgensen+2009 ; lee2011 ; takakuwa et al . 2012 ) and even class 0 ( tobin+2012 ) sources . when and how such disks form remain unclear .",
    "our calculations indicated that the formation of large observable ( @xmath5-scale ) rotationally supported disks .",
    "small disks may be needed to drive fast outflows during the class 0 phase , and may form through non - ideal mhd effects ( machida+2010 ; dappbasu2010 ; dapp+2012 ) . ]",
    "is difficult even in the presence of a large tilt angle @xmath8 during the early protostellar accretion ( class 0 ) phase ( e.g. , alves+2007 ) . ] .",
    "this may not contradict the available observations yet ( maury+2010 ) , since only one keplerian disk is found around a ( late ) class 0 source so far ( l1527 ; tobin+2012 ) ; it could result from a rare combination of an unusually weak magnetic field and a large tilt angle @xmath8 .",
    "if it turns out , through future observations using alma and jvla , that large - scale keplerian disks are prevalent around class 0 sources , then some crucial ingredients must be missing from the current calculations .",
    "possible candidates include non - ideal mhd effects and turbulence .",
    "the existing calculations indicate that realistic levels of the classical non - ideal mhd effects do not weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable large - scale disk formation ( mellonli2009 ; li+2011 ; krasnopolsky+2012 ; see also krasnopolskykonigl2002 and braidingwardle2012a , braidingwardle2012b ) , although misalignment has yet to be considered in such calculations .",
    "supersonic turbulence was found to be conducive to disk formation ( santos - lima+2012,santos - lima+2013 ; seifried+2012 ; myers+2012 ; joos+2013 ) , although dense cores of low - mass star formation typically have subsonic non - thermal line - width and it is unclear whether subsonic turbulence can enable disk formation in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level .",
    "if , on the other hand , it turns out that large - scale keplerian disks are rare among class 0 sources , then the question of disk growth becomes paramount : how do the mostly undetectable class 0 disks become detectable in the class i and ii phase ? if the magnetic braking plays a role in keeping the early disk undetectable , then its weakening at later times may promote rapid disk growth .",
    "one possibility for the late weakening of magnetic braking is the depletion of the protostellar envelope , either by outflow stripping ( mellonli2008 ) or accretion ( machida+2011 ) .",
    "it deserves to be better quantified .",
    "we carried out a set of mhd simulations of star formation in dense cores magnetized to different degrees and with different tilt angles between the magnetic field and the rotation axis .",
    "we confirmed the qualitative result of @xcite that misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis tends to weaken magnetic braking and is thus conducive to disk formation .",
    "quantitatively , we found however that the misalignment enables the formation of a rotationally supported disk only in dense cores where the star - forming material is rather weakly magnetized , with a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath1 ; large misalignment in such cores allows the rotation to wrap the equatorial pseudodisk in the aligned case into a curved curtain that hinders outflow driving and angular momentum removal , making disk formation easier . in more strongly magnetized cores ,",
    "disk formation is suppressed independent of the misalignment angle , because the inner part of the protostellar accretion flow is dominated by strongly magnetized , low - density regions .",
    "if dense cores are as strongly magnetized as inferred by @xcite ( @xcite ; with a mean mass - to - flux ratio @xmath3 ) , it would be difficult for the misalignment alone to enable disk formation in the majority of them .",
    "we conclude that how protostellar disks form remains an open question .",
