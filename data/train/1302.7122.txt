    "beuzit ) .    to estimate the brightness of the point source we inserted artificial negative planets in the individual exposures and re - ran pynpoint . for the fake objects we used an unsaturated psf of hd100546 from one of the photometric calibration datasets . to scale the flux of these objects , the difference in exposure time between the science and the calibration images had to be considered as well as the transmission curves of the two different filters . using published l - band spectra for hd100546 from iso and vlt / isaac ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) we derived a throughput fraction of @xmath3@xmath44 for the narrow band filter compared to the broadband l@xmath11 filter .",
    "the error arises from changes in the pf@xmath33 line emission in hd100546 between the two datasets suggesting that the nb3.74 filter traces variable accretion activity .",
    "also the whole nir and mir continuum varies with an offset of a factor of @xmath31.25 between the two datasets of @xcite , which impacts the error in the final photometry .    for our contrast estimates we varied the brightness of the injected fake sources in steps of 0.1 mag and used two independent methods .",
    "first , we searched for a negative source that , when subtracted , yielded a remaining flux at the object s location similar to the flux level in the surroundings , i.e. , in the extended flux component . secondly , we canceled out all the flux at the object s location .",
    "our best estimate contrasts were @xmath45l@xmath46 mag and @xmath45l@xmath47 mag for both methods , respectively .",
    "a contrast closer @xmath45l@xmath48 mag appears to be more likely , as strong residuals become present in the vicinity of the object  not at the object s location itself  if we cancel out its peak flux completely . for the rest of the analyses and discussion we use @xmath45l@xmath49 mag as default value .",
    "the key points of the discussion and conclusions remain unchanged for a smaller value of the contrast .    the observed flux densities for hd100546 based on the spectra mentioned above translate into an apparent brightness of l@xmath50 4.3 mag , which fits well to the l@xmath51 mag reported in @xcite .",
    "hence we derive an apparent magnitude of l@xmath11=13.2 @xmath4 0.4 mag for the point source component . here",
    "the error is the root of sum of squares of 0.3 mag for the uncertainty in the contrast and @xmath30.25 mag for the uncertainties in the mir continuum .",
    "compared to these uncertainties the variability of the pf@xmath33 line flux and the intrinsic error in our photometric observations are negligible .      assuming that the flux of the point source peaks in the l@xmath11 filter we can estimate its blackbody temperature using wien s law .",
    "we can then derive a lower limit on the object s luminosity by taking into account its apparent l@xmath11 magnitude and its distance .",
    "integrating over all frequencies this exercise yields a minimum luminosity of @xmath52 .",
    "the vlt / naco pdi data presented in @xcite have sufficient spatial resolution and inner working angle to probe the disk surface on scales relevant for the app dataset .",
    "those nir observations revealed sub - structures in the disk in the inner few tens of au .",
    "in particular the existence of a disk  hole \" was suggested as both the final polarization intensity images as well as the polarization fraction images in h and k@xmath53 revealed a local flux deficit at the same location .    in figure  [ disk ]",
    "we show the large scale disk environment revealed by hst / acs @xcite and then , zooming in the inner disk regions , the polarization fraction image of the pdi study .",
    "we overplot in red the contours of the object detected here .",
    "the disk is inclined by @xmath347@xmath423@xmath6 and the position angle of the disk major axis is @xmath3138@xmath424@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if the disk surface was smooth and azimuthally symmetric , the disk image shown in figure  [ disk ] should be mirror symmetric with respect to the disk minor axis running with a position angle of @xmath348@xmath6 through the image center @xcite . however , there are clear asymmetries in form of a deficit in polarization fraction in northern direction , i.e. , along the position of the detected object . based on figure  [ disk ] the disk  hole \"",
    "extends to larger separations and appears more like a  wedge \" . as discussed in @xcite",
    "the underlying physical reason for this feature is not clear at the moment ( e.g. , drop in surface density , disk surface geometry , changing dust properties ) .",
    "however , finding an asymmetry at this specific location renders plausible a physical link between those structures and the source detected here .",
    "based on the object s position angle , the disk inclination and the distance to hd100546 , the object s de - projected separation from the central star is @xmath368@xmath410 au , i.e. , within the large circumstellar disk .",
    "different scenarios to explain both the l band emission and the observed disk structure can be assessed :    _ background source : _ a background source would be observed through the hd100546 disk .",
    "based on the disk model presented in @xcite background flux in the l band should be attenuated by a factor of @xmath36.7@xmath54 mag at a location of @xmath370 au . taking this factor into account",
    "we used the besancon galactic model @xcite to estimate the number of objects in the apparent magnitude range 7 mag @xmath55 l @xmath55 9 mag .",
    "this yielded @xmath3330 objects in a 2 square degree patch on the sky centered around hd100546 .",
    "this number translates into a probability of having such a physically unrelated source in a 1@xmath2 @xmath22 1@xmath2 field of view around the star of @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the l band emission appears to be extended argues against a background object .    _",
    "disk feature : _ the observed l@xmath11 brightness and minimum luminosity are difficult to explain with disk - internal processes alone as the expected temperature in the disk mid - plane at the location of the source is only @xmath350 k @xcite . furthermore , we are not aware of shock - processes that act only locally and might lead to the observed luminosity in a disk that appears to be not very massive .",
    "if it was scattered light that we see , one would expect that also in the nir a maximum in scattered light would be seen . using the pdi images as tracer for scattered light we find a local _ minimum _ here as described above .",
    "_ photospheric emission : _ if the observed point source flux arose solely from the photosphere of a young object the cond and dusty models suggest masses between @xmath315  20 m@xmath57 for an age of 5  10 myr @xcite .",
    "models with lower specific entropy in the initial conditions for the formation process predict even higher masses ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "classical binary formation via core fragmentation or formation via disk instability when the disk was still massive would be the preferred formation mechanisms for an object of this mass . in this case the object formed roughly coeval with the star and would have had time to significantly alter the structure of the main disk , e.g. , dynamically clearing a large azimuthal gap , which has not been observed .    _",
    "ejected planet : _ another massive planet is thought to be orbiting in the inner disk gap ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we speculate that dynamical interactions between multiple planets and the disk could have led to an ejection event .",
    "the emission we see in the l@xmath11 images would then be a combination of the planet s intrinsic emission plus extra luminosity from disk material being heated from the planet moving through the disk .",
    "assuming that the planet was initially orbiting at 10 au its orbital period was @xmath320 years yielding an orbital velocity of @xmath33.2 au@xmath58yr@xmath28 ( @xmath315.2 km@xmath58s@xmath28 ) .",
    "if the ejection velocity is a few times that value it would have taken the planet less then 20 years to reach its current location and within less than 100 years it would be beyond the extent of the observable disk .",
    "given the age of the system , this timescale is extremely small and observing the object exactly at the right time is unlikely .",
    "adding further complexity to this scenario , the ejection needs to occur roughly in the plane of the disk to make a link to the observed disk structures .",
    "_ forming planet : _ in our view the best explanation for the observed morphology of both the disk and the emission source is the detection of a planet during its formation process .",
    "the luminosity of the object is not coming from an isolated photosphere , but rather the planet is still accreting material from the disk .",
    "young , forming gas giants with masses between one and a few jupiter masses are expected to have luminosities between 10@xmath5910@xmath20@xmath60 during the first few hundred thousand years after gas runaway accretion sets in @xcite , in agreement with our lower limit .",
    "furthermore , an object in this mass range is expected to affect the disk structure much less and an azimuthal gap  if it exists  might be below our detection limits in the pdi data .",
    "a narrow gap is hard to see in an inclined disk .",
    "this scenario could also explain the extended component of the emission detected here with some disk material being heated in the accretion process similar to the case of lkca15 b    ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for possible mechanisms to heat the surrounding material during the accretion process ) .",
    "however , we acknowledge that from a theoretical perspective the formation of a gas giant planet at this location is not readily explainable using _ first principles_. for core accretion the timescales to assemble a massive rocky core seem to exceed the estimated age of the star , and given the observed disk parameters the disk does not seem to be gravitationally unstable .      the different dynamics involved in the scenarios outlined above and multi - wavelength photometry and/or spectra will eventually help us to confirm which hypothesis is correct . the proper and parallactic motion of hd100546 will allow us to rule out a background source with second epoch observations obtained as early as mid 2013 . to distinguish between the ejection scenario and the  forming planet \" scenario ,",
    "the baseline for follow - up observations needs to be a few years .",
    "while the object is expected to orbit its star with a period of @xmath3360 years in the latter case , it should move away quickly in radial direction if it were ejected .",
    "also , high spatial resolution alma observations will help to search for an azimuthal gap in the surface mass density ( gas and/or dust ) at the planet s location .",
    "spatially resolved information about the existence ( or non - existence ) of an azimuthal disk gap may allow us to derive a dynamical mass estimate for the planet @xcite .",
    "we have presented observational evidence that a gas giant planet could be forming in the circumstellar disk around the herbig ae / be star hd100546 at a separation of @xmath368 au .",
    "this scenario , among others that we discussed , seems best capable of explaining most of the available data .",
    "however , some aspects remain qualitative and follow - up observations are required to validate our proposed interpretation . together with lkca15 b @xcite ,",
    "the object presented here is currently the best candidate for a forming young gas giant planet .",
    "particularly interesting is that hd100546  b \" would be the first protoplanet that is still embedded in a circumstellar disk and that it forms at large orbital separations . if confirmed , hd100546 would be a unique laboratory to study planet formation and the interaction between forming planets and the disk directly .",
