    "nonlocality is an important phenomenon in nature , particularly in quantum world .",
    "the direct recognition of quantum nonlocality comes from the fact that a quantum wave is spatially extended , in contrast to the point  model for classical particles . in this paper",
    "we mainly discuss how the nonlocality affects the interactions between material particles of spin-@xmath0 .",
    "the problem is intriguing since the nonlocality has been gleamingly implied by the renormalization of conventional quantum field theory ( cqft ) , whence most relevant calculations have to be regulated by momentum cutoff to contain the non - point effect .",
    "the technique however , is usually available only at high  energy scale , the case where the wavelengths of particles are ultra short .",
    "here we take into account the nonlocal effect emerging within the range of interactions  possibly a few wavelengths ; but we do nt get involved in the hotly discussed long  distance effects relating to entangled states and their applications  such as quantum information , quantum communication and quantum computation etc ..    up to date , we have recognized that one can not accurately measure the spatial coordinates of a proton by making an accelerated electron as probe , unless its wavelength is much shorter than the  diameter  of the proton .",
    "but the proton would be smashed and some other hadrons will be involved in the final state ( and thus the scattering becomes inelastic ) if making the electron s wavelength short enough . in the case of elastic scattering ,",
    "the detected proton becomes a * singularity * for the electron s wave .",
    "the reason may be that , in the measurements , the quantity ( coordinates ) we inquire is not at the same spatial level as that the quantum entities settled in ",
    "the coordinate is a four - dimension quantity but the electron s or proton s wave is eight - dimension , or put it in mathematical terminology , the quantity we inquire is real but a quantum object is complex .    it is concluded from purely mathematical point of view that , only located in a space with dimension equal to or larger than that of the detected objects can an observer get complete information of direct measurement . as a tentative method and a starting point , in this paper we propose an * equal observer * , e.g. an electron , is also put into the hilbert space to observe another electron or other fermions such as protons .",
    "presumably , they are at the same spatial level . therefore the electron can use the metric ( gauge ) appropriate for the observed objects to measure physical observables .",
    "the method of * equal observer * is conducive to describing the observed quantum wave ( * nonlocal entity * ) as a whole with possibly less interaction - information lost , unlike in conventional quantum mechanics ( cqm ) where quantum wave is expressed on the basis of space - time points .",
    "the dynamics for the equal observer of a quantum wave is believed to be different from cqm .    in this paper",
    "we employ the similarity between quantum * singularity * and gravitational * singularity * to describe how one fermion observes ( interacts with ) another fermion , and dynamically apply the formalism of general relativity ( gr ) by generalizing its space from real to complex [ fig . 1 ] . as for the elastic scattering of electron and proton , in calculating the radiative corrections to the lowest order of scattering process by employing quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , we encounter the divergence rooted from leading - order potential form @xmath10 while making momentum @xmath11 . in calculating the collision of two heavy celestial bodies by using gr ,",
    "the similar singularity rooted also from the form @xmath10 is encountered , but there the puzzle of divergence is automatically circumvented by carrying out a horizon , the outer of which is physical region , and the inner of which , now known as black hole region , is unphysical .",
    "quantum mechanically , the nonlocal region is usually unobservable in our space - time , and thus unphysical .",
    "enlightened by such physical scenario , we expect to define physical region for elemental fermions in complex space . in analogy to gr , the principle of nonlocality for two interacting fermions is : * there always exists a complex frame for observer * ( one fermion ) *  in which the observed fermion * ( another fermion ) *  looks like a plane wave , no matter the existence of interaction . *",
    "cqft itself can also lead us to perceive the implicit and profound relationship between nonlocality ( quantum wave ) and complex - curvature .",
    "generally , we interpret the scattering matrix between initial state @xmath12 and final state @xmath13 as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 @xmath16 can be any state of a complete set . in this formalism , the operator @xmath17 ( or alternatively , the hamiltonian ) is assumed known .",
    "then the matrix elements @xmath18whose square is proportional to transition rate between initial and final states  can be evaluated .",
    "whereas from an equal  observer angle , all the states @xmath19 are known and the state @xmath20 can be observed , so the operator @xmath17 can be carried out formally @xmath21 , consequently the interaction becomes known .",
    "this latter opposite thought reminds us of the physics in gr , where the force can be realized by the curving of space - time .",
    "so , if only the @xmath17matrix is defined locally in complex - space ( a quantum wave is viewed as a point in such space , and as a whole ) , the differential geometry for * nonlocal entity * would definitely occur .",
    "[ note : for convenience , in what follows we will not employ the language of @xmath17matrix , though relevant . ] the further understanding of the relationship between nonlocality and curvature is achieved in section 10 , where the local conservation laws do nt exist . in summary ,",
    "one will gradually be aware of that all of the above intuitive knowledge on nonlocality could be _ transferred _ to and _ interpreted _ by the complex geometry we used , _ via _ the motion equation for fermions and the field equation for bosons in section 8@xmath229 .",
    "the main results of the paper are as follows : from our dynamical motion equation we can restore all the terms appearing in the quadratic form of dirac equation . for the @xmath23 field [ generalized qed ] , if electromagnetic fields @xmath4 and @xmath3 satisfy @xmath24 , the bosons will gain masses .",
    "based on the discussion of physical region , we can attain two qualitative understandings of quark confinement .    in order not to make readers confused by mathematical details",
    ", we only list some main results of the real and complex geometry with detailed explanations and the necessary calculating techniques , then immediately apply them to physics problems  discussion of dynamical equations and the definition of physical region .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in sections 2 - 5",
    "we introduce the necessary calculating techniques of geometry , the readers familiar with the contents can neglect this part and directly turn to section 6 . then in sections 6 - 9",
    "we apply them to construct the motion equations for fermions and field equation for bosons .",
    "the conservation laws are sketched in section 10 . in section 11 , the physical region",
    "is defined for @xmath23 field [ generalized qed ] and @xmath6 field [ generalized qcd ] .",
    "consequently the qualitative understandings to confinement of quarks is presented under the approximation of interaction vertex @xmath25 .",
    "finally a concluding section is presented to summarize the paper and give some remarks on the applicability of the theory . in appendix",
    "a , the derivation of motion equation for fermions is elaborated .",
    "exterior product proves to be a powerful tool in calculating tensors .",
    "it obeys the rules of grassman algebra .",
    "one of its usages is to give rise to new tensors of higher order .",
    "for example , let @xmath27 be of coordinates for a space , and @xmath28 an arbitrary scalar function with respect to these coordinates , then the total differential of the function @xmath29 is d@xmath30 .",
    "we call @xmath31 a one - order tensor , or a vector , and @xmath32 the basis in the neighborhood of a given point @xmath33 . in terms of exterior product the d@xmath29",
    "is called differential 1-form .",
    "now we can construct 2-form on the basis of the 1-form : dd@xmath34 . the sign @xmath35 denotes the exterior product .",
    "it satisfies the antisymmetric rule : @xmath36 , according to which one can easily conclude dd@xmath37 .",
    "conventionally , an @xmath38-form is written as @xmath39 the repeated index henceforth in this whole paper means summation . here",
    "the @xmath40 are components of the @xmath41order tensor , and the exterior products @xmath42 are the bases .",
    "the above forms can be readily extended to complex variables , e.g. , the two complex variables \\{_z , z_}. and the only 2-form of these complex variables is @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath35__@xmath45 where @xmath43 is a function of _ z _ and _ z. _ here _ z _ and _ z _ are independent variables .",
    "usually a space is called @xmath38-dimension manifold if it can be formed as smoothly as possible by affixing many infinitesimally flat patches of @xmath46(@xmath38-dimension real space ) , @xmath47(@xmath38-dimension complex space ) , or other sorts of @xmath38-dimension spaces .",
    "in fact in this paper we are only concerned about a particular sort of differential manifolds , but for convenience we will call it manifold without specification .    above all , an important property for a given space is the existence of derivatives , which is essential to build up a description of differential geometry . as for hilbert space ,",
    "the existence of derivatives may be determined by that of wave function @xmath48 in it . in general , the existence of derivatives of a real function can be understood intuitively . however , for a complex function , that demands the cauchy - riemann condition be satisfied . when the complex derivative can be defined  everywhere , ",
    "the function is said to be * analytic*. now we review it in respect of complex geometry .",
    "conventionally , we identify an @xmath38-dimension complex manifold with a @xmath49-dimension real manifold .",
    "the complex coordinates and real coordinates have the relation @xmath50 then the following 1-form is written straightforwardly    @xmath51    and subsequently @xmath52 @xmath53 the reverse of the above equations yields @xmath54 @xmath55 here the sign @xmath26 above the equals sign means a * definition*. perform exterior - product upon an arbitrary complex scalar function @xmath56 , it results in a 1-form @xmath57 make @xmath58 , we note that @xmath59 is just the cauchy - riemann relation @xmath60    another important property of a given space is its transformation .",
    "commonly , the vector fields spanned by basis @xmath61 [ real space ] or by basis \\{@xmath62d@xmath63d@xmath64 @xmath65 } [ complex space ] on manifolds are the objects responsible for addressing the geometry of the manifolds .",
    "how do these fields transform from one point to another infinitesimal neighboring point of the manifolds ?",
    "the transformations are usually constrained by some groups as done in the well - known classical mechanics or quantum fields .",
    "we will return to this topic later .",
    "now let s turn to the affection of cauchy - riemann relation on a vector basis .",
    "ignoring some unnecessary details , we assume that the transformation of the @xmath38-dimension complex manifold has the general form @xmath66 as an application of eq.(3.6 ) , replacing the function @xmath29 by @xmath67 , and writing the @xmath67 of eq.(3.7 ) explicitly as @xmath68 , the form of the eq.(3.6 ) now reads @xmath69 make @xmath70 @xmath71 and introduce a @xmath72 matrix @xmath73@xmath74 which satisfies @xmath75 , @xmath76 denoting the identity matrix of rank @xmath49 , then the cauchy - riemann relation ( 3.8 ) can be written @xmath77 and correspondingly an identical relation holds @xmath78 write out the eq .",
    "( 3.10 ) alternatively as @xmath79 and regardless of @xmath73 on @xmath80 , we obtain    @xmath81    combining it with the equation ( 3.4 ) gives    @xmath82    @xmath83    consistently the results ( 3.13)(3.14 ) can also be expressed using the basis @xmath84 and @xmath85d@xmath86,d@xmath87 , respectively as @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 from eq .",
    "( 3.16 ) , we note that the d@xmath91 and d@xmath92 are eigen forms of the matrix @xmath73 , and the relations are independent of the choice of the coordinates . in this respect @xmath73",
    "is called the * complex structure * of the complex manifold .",
    "a manifold with complex structure is called * almost * complex manifold .",
    "the above mathematical formulae will become more meaningful if we replace @xmath93 and @xmath94 by the wave function @xmath95 and @xmath96 from the hilbert space ( manifold ) , which will be recognized in following sections . for convenience ,",
    "henceforth we will put @xmath97 in a more general space , with hilbert space only as a special case .",
    "before giving the general definition of metric ( gauge ) , it is helpful to recall its definition in three - dimensional ( 3-d ) space . using the cartan method of moving frames [ 1 ]",
    ", let every point @xmath98 in 3-d space correspond to a frame @xmath99as following .",

    "now let s turn to some special cases relevant to concrete frames .",
    "a well - known metric form for coordinates frames is the orthogonal one , i.e. @xmath118 . with this relation , eq.(4.4 ) becomes @xmath119 and eqs .",

    "@xmath111 is made by two parts : a matrix ( operator ) @xmath127 and a vector @xmath128 .",
    "since the operator parts @xmath127 are the same for different points @xmath100 , we usually write @xmath129 for general cases while @xmath130 for a given point @xmath100 . in this sense",
    ", the general form of inner product @xmath115 becomes @xmath131 for a given point @xmath33 on manifold , @xmath132 gives rise to a mapping that maps two arguments @xmath133 and @xmath134 to a real or complex number .    then what is the relationship between the basis @xmath135 which has been mentioned in section ii  and this @xmath136 ? that can be recognized by the integral @xmath137 where @xmath29 is an arbitrary function , the integrand @xmath138 is unaltered after integration .",

    "the manner of the jump is to determine the transformation group between the corresponding frames .",

    "if for all components @xmath159 is met , the differential @xmath160 is called the parallel displacement for vector @xmath161 , and the path along which the displacement would occur is solvable from the equation @xmath162 .",

    "the 4-d interval [ in this paper  metric  means the same as  interval  ] @xmath339 in special relativity is hyperbolic type , because if the equation @xmath340 is projected into any 2-d subspace including the time axis , the resultant curve is a hyperbolic type .",

    "searching for what is exactly the largest group would be a tedious work and might simultaneously deviate us from the main line of developing this theory . in this paper",
    "we simply assume the latest group is @xmath365 ( in fact must be a subgroup of @xmath298 ) and bearing in mind that it is for hyperbolic type .",
    "the * metric parallelism * between elliptic types of real space and complex space can be constructed by directly generalizing each of real axes to a complex one .",

    "suppose a complex space spanned by wave functions with only three components , @xmath368 , corresponding to metric @xmath369 *  * and consistent with the probability in quantum mechanics , we conclude that its metric should be of the form @xmath370 , where the integration over the configuration space is implied .",
    "to preserve the probability in the whole complex space , the quantum mechanics requires any transformations performed on the wave function @xmath371 should be elements of special unitary group @xmath8 or its subgroups .",
    "@xmath1 groups are compact , just as @xmath372 .",
    "hereby the metric @xmath373 and group @xmath1 are viewed as the * complex parallellism * to that of elliptic type of real space .",
    "the caution should be practiced that it is not perfect to generalize the rotation transformation in real space directly to conservation of angular momentum as done in quantum mechanics to achieve the same result that metric @xmath374 and @xmath1 are elliptic type .",
    "since the lorentz group includes a spatial rotation part besides the boost part , from the noether theorem of quantum field theory one can also derive the conservation of angular momentum",
    ". then there will be confusions between the two types .",
    "the degrees of freedom of elliptic type presented in this paper are those degrees of freedom such as electro - charges , isospins , or colours etc . , other than spins and spatial angular momentum .",

    "now let s turn to treating the equation ( 8.2 ) .",
    "first let s substitute the explicit form of @xmath410 , @xmath411 , into the equation ( 8.2 ) , concerning only the second term , it yields @xmath412 then the form of motion equation ( 8.2 ) becomes @xmath413 extending the discussion of eqs .",

    "the integration is accompanied by the purely imaginary number @xmath430according to requirement restoring the dirac equation . now",

    "the terms @xmath460 , @xmath461 would behave in similar ways . but the term @xmath462 , without the factor @xmath463 before it , is the exceptional case as discussed in the following .    comparing the eq . ( 8.12 ) with eq . ( 8.6 ) , it is noted that there lacks a mass term @xmath464 in the right hand of eq . ( 8.12 ) .",
    "there are two ways to remedy this flaw .",
    "first , one can directly add a mass term to the right hand of equation ( 8.9 ) , then the equation ( 8.2 ) would have a nonzero term in its right hand too .",
    "that obviously violates our original hypothesis that motion equation is just the geodetic line .",
    "another way out is to accept the term @xmath465 as the mass term .",
    "the reason is that according to the klein - gordon equation of the next section the double derivatives on potential @xmath466 would induce a mass factor and the integration @xmath467 would induce a phase factor depending on closed paths ( loops ) of fermions [ 7 ] , thus the total effect of the term @xmath468 seems equal to a mass term for motion equation of fermions .",
    "if the paths are not closed , then the mass of fermions would become dependent on potential @xmath466 .",
    "the claims of this paragraph are only qualitative , further confirmation is necessary .",
    "the relevant works are in process .",
    "apart from the above qualitative display , all of the four nontrivial terms , @xmath469 , @xmath470 , @xmath471 and @xmath472 , are surely nonlocal since they obviously ruin the local conservation law @xmath473 [ where @xmath474 , which can be directly derived from the conventional dirac equation ( 8.5 ) .",
    "if the approximation @xmath475 is not used here , the replacement @xmath422 @xmath476 would not be reasonable . in general case",
    "the matrix @xmath477 should be expanded to all possibilities of @xmath441matrices ( the total number of matrices is 16 ) without respecting only the vector form of interaction .",
    "but we think there leaves little arbitrariness to extend the theory to include more sorts of interaction .",
    "if surely the approximation @xmath478 holds for fundamental interactions , then accordingly we would extend the replacement @xmath479 @xmath421 to @xmath422 @xmath480 , @xmath481gellmann matrices , when we are concerned about the colour interaction between quarks . that will cause more integrations and other intricate terms to enter into eq .",
    "we will not detail that issue here .    in conventional quantum field theory ( cqft )",
    ", we only regard the part @xmath482 being responsible for the physical process .",
    "however , in view of the nonlocal ( curving ) effects , it has been stated in ref . [",
    "8 ] that the @xmath482 is not complete in describing all physics . even under our rough approximation",
    ", it can be seen in eq .",
    "( 8.12 ) that more terms are present than required .",
    "it includes not only the normal terms @xmath483 but also some other terms on account of nonlocal effect .",
    "moreover , the definition of the connection and thus the physical meaning of @xmath408 now are not the same as those in cqft , since in cqft , @xmath417 ( potential ) is assumed as connection and @xmath483 as the curvature tensor . but here the @xmath417 is viewed only as components of metric tensor and @xmath483 as connection ( force ) .",
    "correspondingly the dimension of motion equation here is also different from that of schrdinger equation , the former is a force , and the latter a potential .",
    "a discrepancy of energy dimension appears under natural unit .",
    "the differential problem in fact has arisen in calculating the terms @xmath485 and @xmath486 . as a hypothesis ,",
    "we have required the wave function to change with respect to space - time variables @xmath487 , with which the terms in dirac equation for electrodynamics are restored . however ,",

    "( 8.3 ) , i.e. @xmath489 . making every coefficient of @xmath490 vanish , then eq.(8.2 ) yields @xmath491 this equation should be thoroughly respected by the electron as an equal level observer to another observed electron .",
    "although it is impossible for the electron to release all information it carries by projecting its complex space to our space - time , @xmath492 , we have to do so to get some physical observerbles in space - time .",
    "just for the physical reason and for consistence , in this section we directly make the replacements of the differential forms @xmath493 and @xmath494 , or the equivalent forms @xmath495 and @xmath496 , as follows : @xmath497 @xmath498      this subsection is devoted to explaining a subtle but important aspect in calculating the curvature tensor .",
