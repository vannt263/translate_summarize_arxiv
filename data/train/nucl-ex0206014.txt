    "gamma  ray emission from classical novae is dominated , during the first hours , by positron annihilation resulting from the beta decay of radioactive nuclei .",
    "the main contribution comes from the decay of @xmath0f  ( half  life of 110  mn ) and hence is directly related to @xmath0f  formation during the outburst .",
    "( see the astrophysical discussions in references @xcite and by hernanz in these proceedings . )",
    "a good knowledge of the nuclear reaction rates of production and destruction of @xmath0f  is required to calculate the amount of @xmath0f  synthesized in novae and the resulting gamma  ray emission . the rate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) relevant for the main mode of @xmath0f  destruction ( i.e , through @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o ) has been the object of many recent experiments@xcite ( see also bardayan in these proceedings and refs . in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this rate remains poorly known at nova temperatures ( lower than 3.5  k ) due to the scarcity of spectroscopic information for levels near the proton threshold in the compound nucleus @xmath2ne .",
    "this uncertainty is directly related to the unknown proton widths ( @xmath3 ) of the first three levels ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 6.419  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ; 6.437  mev , 1/2@xmath7 and 6.449  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ) .",
    "the tails of the corresponding resonances ( at respectively @xmath8 = 8  kev , 26  kev and 38  kev ) can dominate the astrophysical factor in the relevant energy range@xcite . as a consequence of these nuclear uncertainties , the @xmath0f  production in nova and the early gamma ",
    "ray emission is uncertain by a factor of 300@xcite .",
    "this supports the need of new experimental studies to improve the reliability of the predicted annihilation gamma ",
    "ray fluxes from novae .",
    "a direct measurement of the relevant resonance strengths is impossible because they are at least ten orders of magnitude smaller than the weakest directly measured one ( at @xmath9  kev;@xcite and bardayan , these proceedings ) due to coulomb barrier penetrability .",
    "hence , we used an indirect method aiming at the determination of the one nucleon spectroscopic factors ( @xmath10 ) in the analog levels of the mirror nucleus ( @xmath2f ) by a neutron transfer reaction : d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath2f .",
    "( analog , levels expected to have similar nuclear properties have been identified in @xmath2f  and @xmath2ne  spectra@xcite . ) from the spectroscopic factors it is possible to calculate the proton widths through the relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the single particle width readily obtained from a model .",
    "the main reason for the choice of a transfer reaction is the much higher reaction cross - section as compared to the direct proton capture .",
    "the spectroscopic factors , @xmath10 , are extracted from the angular distribution of the escaping nucleon via the relation :    @xmath13    where the @xmath14 is the experimental angular distribution of the protons from the d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath2f reaction while @xmath15 is the theoretical one ( distorded wave born approximation ) and @xmath16 is a known coefficient .",
    "since @xmath0f  is a short lived ( 110  mn ) radioactive isotope , it can not be used as a target .",
    "it must be first produced , then accelerated and directed to the deuterium target ( inverse kinematics ) .",
    "we performed the experiment at the _ centre de recherche du cyclotron _ in louvain ",
    "neuve ( belgium ) where such a beam has been developed .",
    "the @xmath0f  is produced through the @xmath0o(p , n ) reaction , chemically extracted to form ch@xmath17f molecules , transferred to the cyclotron source@xcite and accelerated to 14  mev .",
    "the targets are made of deuteriated polypropylene ( cd@xmath18 ) of @xmath19100  @xmath20g/@xmath21 thickness .",
    "for the energy considered here ( 1.4  mev in the center of mass ) , the deuteron and the outgoing proton are both below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the major advantages is a reduction of the contribution of compound - nucleus reactions leading to a better extraction of spectroscopic factors .",
    "the experimental setup is depicted in figure  [ f : setup ] .",
    "it consists of two silicon multistrip detectors composed of sectors with 16 concentric strips ( of 5  mm width ) built by the louvain ",
    "la  neuve and edinburgh collaboration@xcite .",
    "they measure the angle ( strip number ) , energy and time of flight ( for particle identification ) of the particles .",
    "one , lamp , is positioned 9  cm upstream from the target ; it consists of 6 sectors forming a conical shape to optimize angular coverage .",
    "with such a geometry , it covers laboratory angles between 115@xmath22 and 160@xmath22 i.e. forward center of mass angles between 12@xmath22 and 40@xmath22 providing a good acceptance for protons in the domain of interest for the differential cross section .",
    "indeed , the proton angular distribution as measured in lamp is the @xmath14 term in eq .",
    "[ q : dwba ] .",
    "the other detector , leda , is made up of 8 sectors forming a disk positioned 40  cm downstream from the target and is used for background reduction and normalization .",
    "the levels of interests are situated high above the alpha emission threshold ( at 4.013  mev ) and their almost exclusive decay mode is through @xmath2f@xmath23n+@xmath24 .",
    "hence , to reduce background , we required coincidences between a proton in lamp and a @xmath25n ( or @xmath24 discriminated by time of flight ) in leda .",
    "following monte carlo simulations , the exact positions of the two detectors have been chosen to optimize resolution and acceptance .",
    "the proton detection efficiency is found to be 24% and is only slightly reduced to 19% when the coincidence condition is applied .",
    "rutherford elastic scattering of @xmath0f on carbon from the target , detected in leda , provide the ( target thickness ) @xmath26 ( beam intensity ) normalization .",
    "f  spectrum ( corresponding to 65% of the total statistics ) showing the two 3/2@xmath6 levels of astrophysical interest around 6.5  mev of excitation energy.,width=491 ]    during the 7 days experiment , 15 bunches of @xmath271  ci of @xmath0f  were produced providing each a mean beam intensity of 5@xmath28 particles per second over a period of @xmath192  hours .",
    "the beam contamination ( by @xmath0o ) was found to be smaller than 10@xmath29 .",
    "thanks to the kinematics , at this low energy , only light particles ( p and @xmath24 from d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath2f and d(@xmath0f,@xmath30o ) can reach lamp while the coincidences with leda provide a further selection .",
    "the excitation energy of the decaying @xmath2f  levels can be kinematically reconstructed from the energies and angles of the detected protons and the known beam energy .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is represented in figure  [ f : spect ] where vertical lines represent the known position of the @xmath2f  levels .",
    "the resolution is not sufficient to separate the various levels but the two 3/2@xmath6 levels of interest at 6.497 and 6.528  mev ( the analogs of the 3/2@xmath6 levels in @xmath2ne ) are well separated from the other groups of levels .",
    "there is no peak corresponding to the 1/2@xmath7 level because it is so broad ( @xmath31  kev ) that it can not be disentangled from the background .",
    "the angular distribution , @xmath14 , obtained from the data corresponding to the 6.5  mev peak , i.e. the 3/2@xmath6 levels , is in good agreement@xcite with the theoretical one @xmath15 ( using nuclear potentials from ref .",
    "@xcite ) providing evidence that the analysis is reliable ( e.g. negligible compound nucleus contribution and @xmath32 transferred angular momentum ) .",
    "since the two 3/2@xmath6 levels are not resolved , eq .",
    "[ q : dwba ] gives the _ sum _ of the two spectroscopic factors : @xmath33 .",
    "the important consequence of this preliminary value is that the contribution of these resonances to the rate _ can not _ be neglected but that the nominal rate ( @xmath34 ) used in gamma  ray flux calculations is not ruled out . however , the extreme case where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 have also to be considered to obtain upper and lower rate limits . figure",
    "[ f : rate ] shows the present reduction on @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  rate uncertainty brought by this experiment .",
    "hopefully , progress in the data analysis ( energy calibration and normalization ) will further reduce this uncertainty but new experiments are required to obtain a reliable reaction rate for nova gamma  ray flux calculations ."
