    "in the last years , the progress of technology has enabled the experimental study of very interesting phenomena taking place in mesoscopic systems .",
    "the fascinating feature in these systems is that several physical processes that have a pure quantum - mechanical origin can be observed in a suitable transport experiment .",
    "paradigmatic examples are the aharanov - bohm effect in systems with annular geometry and bloch oscillations in periodic structures .",
    "the aharanov - bohm effect in circular devices motivated a vast theoretical and experimental activity for some time now . a metallic mesoscopic ring threaded by a static magnetic field",
    "displays persistent currents , which oscillate as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath7 , with a period @xmath8 @xcite . like other mesoscopic phenomena , these persistent currents are a consequence of the coherence of the wave function throughout the system .",
    "the aharanov - bohm effect also manifests itself when such a ring is connected to two metallic leads at different external voltages .",
    "this geometry is usually employed in experiments to measure the conductance of the metallic ring in the presence of the external flux . in this case ,",
    "quantum interference cause oscillations in the current through the collector lead with a period @xmath9 as @xmath7 varies @xcite .",
    "more than 70 years ago , bloch predicted the occurrence of a time - periodic motion of the electrons in a band under the influence of an external constant electric field @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently , bloch oscillations with a period @xmath11 has been observed in superlattices @xcite , being @xmath12 the periodicity of the lattice and @xmath13 the electron charge .",
    "this motivated new theoretical development in the field @xcite .",
    "a metallic ring penetrated by a time - dependent magnetic field is a very interesting system , worth of theoretical and experimental study .",
    "since time is the unavoidable variable in any experimental measurement of currents while the magnetic field is varied , that device is more realistic than its static - field counterpart .",
    "the case of a magnetic flux with a linear time dependence is particularly appealing because this situation is closely related with that of electrons in a periodic lattice under the influence of a dc voltage .",
    "in fact , a magnetic flux that varies linearly in time induces a constant electric field @xmath14 , being @xmath12 the longitude of the ring , while the geometry of the ring produces a periodic structure for the electrons inside it .",
    "while a good amount of literature can be found on the aharanov - bohm effect , considerably fewer studies have been reported on this problem .",
    "it has been addressed in an early work by bttiker , imry and landauer @xcite who predicted that the electrons in an ideal one - dimensional ring should execute bloch oscillations driven by the induced electric field .",
    "some time later , landauer and bttiker showed that inelastic scattering in that system generates a dc current and dissipation @xcite . a single lead connected between the ring and an external reservoir",
    "was later proposed by bttiker as a concrete way to introduce inelastic scattering events @xcite . since then , the attention focused mainly in aharanov - bohm loops where the flux threading the ring is static and devices with inserted quantum dots seem to occupy the center of the stage @xcite .    in this work",
    "the problem of the normal - metal loop in the presence of an external time dependent magnetic flux with the form @xmath0 is studied in the framework of non - equilibrium green functions .",
    "we consider an ideal ring described by a one - dimensional tight - binding model with a bandwidth @xmath3 and we propose an approach to calculate the green functions in real space .",
    "this procedure enables to gain insight on the different energy scales that intervene in the dynamics of the problem .",
    "in addition , it has the advantage of being also adequate to tackle more general situations where the configuration is not translational invariant , like the case of rings with disorder and with inserted barriers or quantum dots .",
    "the experimental study of the physical properties of the ring in the presence of the variable magnetic field requires some kind of coupling between this system and the external world .",
    "we consider a concrete experimental setup to study time - dependent charge oscillations in the ring .",
    "this consists in a single lead connecting it to a particle reservoir .",
    "the goal is to study the quantum tunneling between the ring and the reservoir , originated by the time dependent oscillations driven by the induced electric field .",
    "the metallic wire is described as an ideal system of non - interacting electrons and the reservoir is assumed to fix the chemical potential @xmath15 .",
    "we use an approach based in baym - kadanoff - keldysh formalism to solve the coupled system .",
    "this method has been successful to derive generalized transport equations @xcite in systems with an explicit time dependence . in the present context the main idea is to represent the effect of the lead and the reservoir by the self - energy effects they produce .    in the case of pure one - dimensional rings pierced by a static magnetic field in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the persistent currents vanish as @xmath16 , being @xmath12 the circumference of the ring @xcite . in the time",
    "dependent case there is a non trivial connection between the size of the system and its dynamical behavior .",
    "we study the behavior of the retarded green function as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath12 .",
    "we argue that for a magnetic field varying at a rate such that @xmath18 , the time dependent features of the relevant physical magnitudes vanish as @xmath16 . instead , for more rapid changes of the magnetic field such that @xmath19 , their time dependence vanish exponentially fast as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "our aim is to show that for moderate lengths @xmath12 and field variations satisfying the condition @xmath18 , quantum tunneling takes place between the ring and the reservoir and a time dependent current could be measured in the lead .",
    "we also analyze the effect that inelastic scattering originated by the coupling to the reservoir cause on the transport properties of this system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to expose the theoretical approach . in section iii we obtain the set of equations to calculate the retarded green function in the ring unconnected from the reservoir as well as connected to it .",
    "results are shown in section iv .",
    "we finally summarize our study and present the conclusions in section v.",
    "we consider an experimental setup to study the dynamics of the ring in the presence of the time - dependent magnetic flux of the form @xmath20 .",
    "the device is sketched in fig .",
    "1a . our aim is to study the quantum tunneling between the ring and an external particle reservoir by measuring the current flowing through the lead .",
    "we use an approach based in baym - kadanoff - keldysh non - equilibrium green functions to solve the coupled system .",
    "we follow a procedure similar to that used in refs.@xcite , where the effect of the lead and the reservoir is represented by a suitable self - energy .",
    "the system is simplified as indicated in fig .",
    "the lead and the reservoir are described as an effective system @xmath21 with a fixed chemical potential @xmath15 .",
    "a contact , described by a single bond , establishes the connection between the ring and the lead .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this system contains three pieces : @xmath22 the first term describes the metal ring threaded by the magnetic flux .",
    "we consider non - interacting spinless electrons in a tight - binding chain of longitude @xmath12 with @xmath23 sites , lattice parameter @xmath24 and periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , being @xmath29 the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbors .",
    "the time - dependent phase @xmath30 attached to each link accounts for the presence of the external magnetic flux .",

    "this property is crucial for the physical effects we aim to address .",
    "in particular , the fact that in a stationary situation these two functions coincide , cause the current @xmath47 to vanish . instead , in a non - equilibrium regime , an ac current can flow through the lead .",
    "as we shall see , this current exhibits a periodic behavior which is originated by the existence of bloch oscillations in the ring .    to complete the theoretical description of the system ,",

    "the existence of two kinds of behaviors in the scaling of @xmath122 has a rather simple explanation .",
    "we recall that this green function corresponds to a system of electrons in an open tight - binding chain with a bias @xmath144 between its edges .",
    "the different scaling laws result from a concurrence between the kinetic energy of the electrons in the chain and the strength of the bias .",

    "our numerical analysis indicates that this is also the case in the presence of a bias , provided that the strength of the bias is not larger than the bandwidth associated with the kinetic energy of the electrons .",
    "as the bias increases and overcomes the value of the bandwidth , this probability becomes smaller and decreases exponentially with the size of the system .",

    "( [ e11 ] ) with the replacement of @xmath108 by the function @xmath154 which contains the corrections due to the escape to the leads .",

    "the latter exhibits a significant drop near the site @xmath103 where the lead is connected , which becomes more abrupt as the strength of the inelastic scattering introduced by @xmath165 increases .",
    "we have studied the transport properties of a ring threaded by a magnetic flux with a linear dependence on time @xmath0 .",
    "we considered an experimental setup to investigate the transport properties of this system , which consists in a single lead connecting the ring to an external particle reservoir .",
    "we employed a theoretical approach based in baym - kadanoff - keldysh non - equilibrium green functions .",
    "we derived a system of linear equations to calculate in real space the retarded green function of the disconnected ring as well as for the ring coupled to the particle reservoir .",
    "this method provides a transparent picture for the different energy scales governing the dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , we identified two kind of behaviors in the green functions of the uncoupled ring , depending on the ratio @xmath1 . for magnetic fields varying at a rate such that @xmath5 , the time dependent features are important in the behavior of the green functions of finite rings and tend to disappear as @xmath151 when the size of the system increases . instead , for @xmath138 , the green functions tend exponentially fast to a static solution as the size of the system increases .",
    "these two kinds of behaviors manifest themselves in the transport properties of the system when the inelastic scattering length is larger than the perimeter of the ring . within the time - dependent regime ,",
    "the current through the lead as well as the current along the ring and the charge inside it , display oscillations with the period @xmath6 of bloch oscillations driven by the induced electric field .",
    "in the situation of a rapid magnetic field variation satisfying @xmath138 , no current is measured in the lead and no oscillatory behavior is observed except for extremely small rings .",
    "we stress that this effect has its grounds in the concurrence between the kinetic energy of the electrons and the strength of the dc voltage due to the induced electric field , being independent of the loss of coherence introduced by inelastic scattering .",
    "we finally analyzed the effect of inelastic scattering caused by the coupling with the external reservoir in the time - dependent transport .",
    "we found that the amplitude of the oscillations of the current through the lead as well as the dc component of the current along the ring , tend to vanish in the two limiting situations of very weak and very strong inelastic scattering , attaining a maximum for intermediate strengths .    on the technical side",
    ", we find that the present approach provides an useful theoretical tool to investigate the effects of time dependent magnetic fluxes and induced electric fields in other interesting systems of larger complexity , like metallic loops with disorder , rings with inserted barriers and quantum dots and one dimensional systems with electronic correlations .",
