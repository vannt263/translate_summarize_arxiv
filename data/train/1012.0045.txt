    "it is important that we report the new observation .",
    "we use the _ chandra _  data on the , discussed and fitted by @xcite , and add one new data point . briefly ,",

    "we exclude the subarray observation of cas a @xcite , since the pileup properties @xcite of this spectrum differ from the others , and those observations in which the cas a ns dithered over bad pixels ( most of the 2004 observations ) .",
    "the new data point is produced from two acis - s observations of cas a ( @xcite : obsids 10936 , 13177 ) taken on 2010 october  31 and 2010 november  2 for 33 and 17 ks ( respectively ) and telemetered in graded mode ( as done for previous cas a observations ) .",
    "we used ciao 4.2 and caldb 4.2.1 to reprocess the data and produce response functions , correcting for the time - dependent acis quantum efficiency degradation and gain changes , but not for the charge - transfer inefficiency ( as this can not be modeled with graded data ) .",
    "we extracted source spectra with a 4 pixel ( 2.37 \" ) radius region , and background spectra from an annulus of 5 to 8 pixels , as in @xcite .",
    "we combined the two new observations into one set of spectra and responses",

    "we fitted these spectra simultaneously , forcing the ns mass and radius , along with the distance and @xmath12 , to be the same as in the best fit of @xcite and @xcite , and finding the 1@xmath13 errors on the surface temperature at each epoch .",
    "this fitting is designed to cleanly define the relative variation in the temperature , separating this question from the absolute uncertainty in the temperature ( described in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted values of the non - redshifted effective surface temperature @xmath14 ( table 1 ) are slightly different from those reported by @xcite for the 20042009 observations , but within the 1@xmath13 errors .",

    "however , the theory predicts ( e.g. , @xcite ) a shorter relaxation , lasting typically @xmath18 yr .",
    "we propose another interpretation based on the effects of superfluidity in ns cores , in line with the work of @xcite .",
    "neutrons , protons ( and other baryons if present ) in ns interiors can be superfluid ( due to cooper pairing ) .",
    "free neutrons in the inner crust and protons in the core undergo cooper pairing in spin - singlet state , while neutrons in the core can pair in spin - triplet state .",

    "our idea is that the initial crust - core relaxation in  is over , leaving the star sufficiently warm .",
    "we assume further that not too strong triplet - state neutron superfluidity appeared in the core some time ago .",
    "it initiates a splash of neutrino emission due to cpf process producing the second @xmath11 drop that mimics the second ( delayed ) thermal relaxation .",
    "the second drop is mainly regulated by ( i ) the density dependence @xmath20 of the critical temperature for the neutron pairing in the ns core , ( ii ) the reduction factor @xmath3 of cpf process by collective effects in superfluid matter and ( iii ) the neutrino luminosity prior to the onset of neutron superfluidity .",
    "these properties are very model dependent and poorly known but can be constrained from the  observations .",
    "the cpf process was first predicted by @xcite for singlet - state pairing neglecting collective superfluid effects .",
    "collective effects can suppress the process ( @xmath21 ) as was first noticed by @xcite and calculated later by @xcite ; some discussion is also given by @xcite ; the results are controversial .",

    "we are interested in triplet - state pairing in which case the suppression is thought to be less dramatic .",
    "if the latter cpf process were not affected by collective effects , then 24% of neutrino emissivity would go through the vector weak interaction channel , while the rest ( 76% ) would go through the axial - vector channel .",
    "collective effects suppress the vector channel almost completely but the axial - vector channel survives . exact value of @xmath3 is debatable ( the lowest estimate @xmath23 is given by @xcite ) . instead of relying on any specific model , we consider @xmath3 as a free parameter .",

    "we mean the parametrization of apr results by @xcite  the version apr  i proposed by @xcite .",
    "the maximum mass of a stable ns for this eos is @xmath24 ; the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission is open in stars with @xmath25 .",
    "let the direct urca process and even less efficient modified urca process be either not allowed or strongly suppressed in the",
    ". otherwise the star would be too cold after the initial crust - core relaxation ; we would be unable to significantly speed up its cooling by the cpf process . to suppress urca processes we assume the presence of strong proton superfluidity in the core , with critical temperature @xmath26  k ; exact values of @xmath27 are unimportant .",
    "it occurs within a few days after the star formation .",
    "the proton cpf neutrino emission does not influence the cooling even if this emission were not affected by collective effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as long as neutrons are non - superfluid , the neutrino emission is mainly generated in neutron - neutron bremsstrahlung process .",
    "it is weak and leaves the  sufficiently warm before the second temperature drop .",
    "unless the contrary is indicated , we consider nss with ordinary ( non - accretted , non - magnetized ) heat blanketing envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) and neglect superfluid effects in the stellar crust ( which weakly affect the cooling after the crust - core relaxation ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note , that a splash of cpf neutrinos makes the star slightly non - isothermal , with the cooling slightly dependent on the thermal conductivity in the core , but the isothermal state is soon restored .",

    "we do not rely on any specific theoretical model but consider three phenomenological curves ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ( locating neutron superfluidity at progressively lower densities ) . in our case",
    "the maximum of @xmath1 is strictly constrained to @xmath28  k. higher or lower @xmath1 peaks would start the second temperature drop in the  earlier or later than required by the observations ( or even completely wash out this drop in a very young or old star ) .",
    "the @xmath1 profiles should not be too narrow and the reduction factor @xmath3 should not be too small ( otherwise the second temperature drop would be weak ) .",
    "other plots give theoretical cooling curves @xmath29 ( i.e. , the redshifted surface temperature versus @xmath30 ) .",

    "[ fig : tc ] gives three cooling curves for the @xmath31 star of nearly  age with @xmath1 models ( a)(c ) from the left panel and with @xmath32 ( axial vector channel is not suppressed ) .",
    "the curves are compared with the  data .",
    "all three superfluidity models agree with these data .",
    "taking superfluidity ( a ) and increasing the stellar mass to @xmath33 makes the cpf process more important and starts the second temperature drop earlier ( the dotted curve ) , in disagreement with the data .",
    "however , we could easily readjust ( slightly decrease ) @xmath1 and explain the data with the @xmath33 model .",
    "therefore , we can successfully fit the data for a range of ns masses and take the @xmath31 star as an example .",
    "the inset shows the cooling curve ( a ) ( @xmath34 ) over longer time scale .",
    "the second temperature drop at @xmath35  yr is clearly pronounced here .",
    "also , we show the cooling of non - superfluid star ( curve n ) and the star with proton superfluidity alone ( curve psf ) . without the cpf process , the slopes of both curves are much smaller than required .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] we test two neutron superfluidity models , ( a ) and ( c ) , against observations of other isolated nss .",
    "observational data are taken from references cited in @xcite and @xcite with the exception of psr j0007 + 7303 .",

    "we make a reasonable assumption that all nss have different masses but the same physics of matter in their cores .",
    "we present cooling curves ( solid lines ) for a number of masses ( from top to bottom ) , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "recall , that we use the model of strong proton superfluidity in the entire core that switches off urca processes in all stars . with this assumption ,",
    "neutron superfluidity ( a ) allows us to explain almost all sources , except for warmest and coolest ones ( for their ages ) .",
    "however , neutron superfluidity ( c ) produces too strong cpf neutrino emission in low - mass stars and can not explain the majority of warmer stars , although it agrees with the  data .",
    "furthermore , we can rise the cooling curves of low - mass , not too old nss assuming they have more heat transparent heat - blanketing envelopes of light elements .",
    "for example , the dashed curves in fig .  [ fig : cool ] are calculated for @xmath38 ns with the carbon envelope of mass @xmath39 .",
    "we can also lower the cooling curves of massive ( @xmath37 ) stars : the dash - dotted lines are computed by taking more realistic models for proton superfluidity , with @xmath40 going down at high densities .",
    "this opens direct urca process in the inner core and gives coldest possible nss .",
    "therefore , we can really explain all the data with superfluidity ( a ) , but not with superfluidity  ( c ) .",
    "the second temperature drop is known in the ns cooling theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cooling models like ( a ) and ( c ) in fig.[fig : cool ] have been analysed by @xcite with the same conclusion that models like ( a ) can explain observations of all isolated nss .",
    "similar models of nss with nucleon cores , where direct urca is forbidden but cpf operates , were used as the basis of the minimal cooling theory ( @xcite ) although that theory employs selected @xmath19 profiles , most favorable by the theory of nucleon superfluidity .",
    "now we see that the model of @xcite is also suitable to explain the  data .",
    "but for constant @xmath41 over the core at three values @xmath42 ( @xmath43 k ) , 0.4 ( @xmath44  k ) and 0.7 ( @xmath45  k ) .",
    "the inset shows the same cooling curves but over larger range of ages , together with the dashed curve for non - superfluid star and the dash - and - dot curve for the star without proton superfluidity but with neutron superfluidity at @xmath46  k. [ fig : reduce ] ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : reduce ] demonstrates the effect of suppression of cpf neutrino emission in the axial - vector channel . to maximize the cpf emission we take constant @xmath41 over the core .",
    "it produces especially strong splash of cpf neutrinos when the second temperature drop starts .",
    "three solid lines are the cooling curves for the @xmath31 star calculated at @xmath3=0.7 , 0.4 and 0.19 .",
    "otherwise the conditions are the same as in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] . with our constant @xmath41 ,",

    "the case @xmath48 now agrees with the observations .",
    "smaller @xmath42 gives slower cooling that can not explain the data .",
    "notice that the @xmath41=const model is hardly realistic . for more realistic @xmath1 profiles we can reconcile theory with the  data at @xmath49 .",
    "this gives a useful restriction on the uncertain theoretical parameter @xmath3 .",
    "in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : reduce ] we show the same three cooling curves over larger range of ages .",
    "in addition , we plot the same dashed line for non - superfluid star as in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : tc ] , and another dot - and - dashed line for the star with neutron superfluidity alone with @xmath50  k and @xmath32 .",
    "the latter superfluidity triggers a splash of cpf neutrinos , but the main modified urca neutrino emission is too strong and the splash can not produce a steep @xmath11 decline required by the observations . adding a carbon surface layer of mass @xmath51 , we could raise the latter curve to the  level but would be unable to reproduce the cooling slope .",
    "our calculations show that the modified urca emission should be suppressed at least by a factor of 30 ( for the most efficient cpf emission with @xmath32 and constant @xmath41 ) to get the required slope .",
    "taking smaller @xmath3 or narrower @xmath1-profile would require stronger suppression of the modified urca process .",
    "we report a new ( november , 2010 ) _ chandra _  observation of the young  that confirms the observed @xcite steady decline of the surface temperature @xmath11 ( by 4% over 10 years ) . we propose a natural explanation of the observed decline .",
    "we assume that the  underwent the traditional internal crust - core relaxation some time ago and now demonstrates the second temperature drop due to the onset of triplet - state neutron superfluidity in its core and associated neutrino emission .",
    "we can explain the  observations under the following conditions :    * the maximum critical temperature for triplet - state pairing of neutrons should be @xmath52  k. otherwise the second temperature drop occurs earlier or later than required by observations .",
    "* the @xmath1 profile over the ns core should be rather wide for the cpf neutrino emission to gain enough strength .",
    "* for the same reason the suppression of the cpf process by collective effects can not be too strong ( @xmath49 ) . * the neutrino emission of the star",
    "before the second temperature drop should be 30100 times lower than due to the modified urca process ( e.g. , the modified urca can be suppressed by strong proton superfluidity ) . otherwise the second temperature drop would not be pronounced .",
    "when these criteria are met , we can still locate @xmath1 profiles in different parts of the ns core .",
    "if , however , we wish to explain all current observations of isolated nss with one and the same @xmath1-profile , we will be forced to push this profile deeper in the core ( fig.[fig : cool ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could employ broader profiles but with density - dependent factor @xmath3 ( which can increase within the core as for singlet - state pairing , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this would shift the efficiency of the cpf process to higher @xmath53 in superfluid matter .",
    "we have taken one eos and focused on @xmath54 neutron star model but our basic conclusions will not change for a large variety of eoss and masses @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , taking the same eos we have considered the models with @xmath15 from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . by slightly changing @xmath1 profiles we are able to explain the data for any @xmath15 from this range .",
    "our calculations indicate that the second temperature drop lasts for a few tens of years and  is at its active cpf neutrino emission stage",
