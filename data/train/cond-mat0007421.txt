    "the compound cugeo@xmath0 shows a spin  peierls ( sp ) transition at 14 k : in each cu chain the cu cations dimerize and the spins form singlets . in this paper",
    "we study the exchange constants as a function of variations in the lattice parameters in the uniform spin phase as well as the sp phase .",
    "changes in the lattice parameters can also be caused by applying pressure , or doping .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next subsections of this introduction we discuss the relevant structural , magnetic and magnetoelastic data .",
    "we finish this introduction with a general qualitative discussion of the theory of superexchange applied to this specific compound .    in the following sections we give a detailed account of the calculation of the exchange constants .",
    "first , in section [ section : theory ] we give details of a fourth  order perturbation theory approach .",
    "we show that the usually neglected side groups ( in the case of cugeo@xmath0 this is ge ) have in this particular case a large influence on the sign and magnitude of the nearest ",
    "neighbor ( @xmath1 ) exchange interaction . the influence of this ge side group is studied .",
    "using perturbation theory we calculate the @xmath1 ( sections [ subsection : nn exchange perturbation theory ] and [ subsection : explicit side group hybridization ] ) and next  nearest  neighbor ( @xmath5 ) exchange ( section [ section : nnn a+b+c exchange ] ) constants in the @xmath4 ( chain ) direction as well as in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction .",
    "the values of the exchange constants thus obtained are quite reasonable , but their dependence on the lattice parameters strongly deviates from the experimental results .",
    "therefore , in section [ section : cluster model ] we use a different method , calculating the states of a cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquette exact .",
    "this method gives quite satisfactory results for the lattice parameter ( e.g. pressure and temperature ) dependence of these exchange constants .    in order to account for multiple spin transfer paths we also performed a calculation using a band model for the anion states .",
    "the results reported in section [ section : band model ] of the latter compare well with those obtained from the exact diagonalization of the cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquette in section [ section : cluster model ] . finally , in section [ section : discussion ] we give a discussion of the results ; the conclusions and summary can be found in the final section [ section : conclusions and summary ] .      before we discuss the magnetic properties it is convenient to describe relevant structural details .",
    "the structure of cugeo@xmath3 in the high temperature ( ht ) phase and in the sp phase has been determined by braden et al @xcite .",
    "some results of their analysis can be found in table [ table : structure ] . in fig .",
    "[ figure : cuo - chain+ge ] we have indicated the principal structural parameters important for our discussion of the exchange constants in the @xmath4 direction . in the ht phase all cu and all ge ions are equivalent .",
    "the cu have a near ideal square  planar coordination by o2 and these edge  sharing squares form a cuo@xmath2 ribbon in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "there are two o1 ions at a distance 2.755 @xmath8 nearly perpendicular to the ribbon , which would complete a tetragonally distorted octahedral coordination of cu .",
    "this distance is too large to be of importance for the local electronic structure of cu .",
    "the ge have a nearly ideal tetrahedral coordination of o : two o2 , shared with two cuo@xmath2 ribbons , and two o1 s .",
    "the @xmath9 o  ge  o angles are about 109@xmath10 , very near to the ideal tetrahedral angle .",
    "the interatomic distance of the two o2 neighbors of a ge is : 2.82 @xmath8 .",
    "these two o2 connect two cu in different ribbons along the @xmath7axis .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : nn and nnn exchange b - axis ]    our preferred description of this system is as follows : linear geo@xmath0 chains of corner sharing geo@xmath11 tetrahedra , and cuo@xmath12 ribbons of edge sharing cuo@xmath11 squares , both units in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "these two units share the o  which we will call the _ hinges _ of the structure  of the cuo@xmath12 ribbon : at each side of the cuo@xmath12 ribbon one geo@xmath0 chain , which form a _",
    "neutral undulating two dimensional layered _ structure in the @xmath7 direction ( see fig . [",
    "figure : harmonica model ] .",
    "the interatomic distance of o2o2 , which connect two cu in different ribbons along the @xmath6axis , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : nn and nnn exchange a - axis ] , is 3.06 @xmath8 .",
    "this is much longer than twice the usually used ionic radius of o@xmath13 for 6fold coordination , which is about 1.40 @xmath14 0.05 @xmath15 , but nearly equal to twice the van der waals radius of oxygen ( @xmath16 @xmath15 ) .",
    "this signifies that the bonding between two layers as defined in the preceding paragraph is small , and probably of the van der waals type .",
    "a much smaller ionic radius of o@xmath13 of about 1.25 @xmath8 , fits the interatomic distances : ge  o2 and cu  o2 and the o2o2 forming the bridge between two cu in the same ribbon .",
    "this small ionic radius for o agrees with the rule from structural chemistry that a decrease in the coordination number causes a decrease in the ionic radius : in our case o2 is coordinated by only three cations .",
    "other important structural factors for the calculation of the superexchange interactions are the _ bond angles_. the most important angle is _ bridge _ angle @xmath17cu  o  cu in the ribbon plane , which is slightly larger than 90@xmath10 .",
    "the deviation of this angle from 90@xmath10 , @xmath18 , determines the sign of the @xmath1 superexchange .",
    "another important angle is the _ hinge _ angle @xmath19(o@xmath2o@xmath2)@xmath20ge , which is about 160@xmath10 .",
    "these angles change as a function of pressure , doping , temperature and at the sp transition . in the sp phase",
    "the hinge and bridge angle have two distinct values ( see table [ table : structure ] ) due to the dimerization of the cu chains . a very simplified model for this sp transition",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : model sp transition ] .",
    "it is predominantly these angular variations which determine the properties of cugeo@xmath3 .    the angles which determine the transfer in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction are given in fig .",
    "[ figure : nn and nnn exchange a - axis ] and [ figure : nn and nnn exchange b - axis ] : the angles @xmath21(o2o2)@xmath20 o@xmath22 and @xmath23(o2o2)@xmath20o@xmath24 , which are about 120@xmath25 and @xmath26(o2o2)@xmath27cu and @xmath28(o2o2)@xmath29cu , which are about 110@xmath25 .",
    "these angles show only very small changes as a function of temperature and through the sp transition .",
    "the magnetic properties  as well as properties related to it  of cugeo@xmath3 in the ordered sp phase can well be described by the cross  fisher theory , however magnetic properties above the sp transition in the uniform phase do not agree with the usual 1d  heisenberg spin 1/2 model with @xmath1 exchange @xmath30 only .",
    "also a consistent interpretation of these properties based on this model seems impossible because it leads to widely different values for this exchange constant .    in table",
    "[ table : experimental exchange constants ] we have collected experimental values for the exchange constants of cugeo@xmath3 . the exchange constants in the @xmath4 direction",
    "are defined by the heisenberg hamiltonian : @xmath31 [ equation : heisenberg hamiltonian ] some authors do not specify how they define their exchange constants , which can easily lead to confusion . at present a model which includes also @xmath5 exchange @xmath32 along the cu chain , gives the most consistent set of exchange parameters .",
    "assuming @xmath33 to 15 mev and the frustration parameter @xmath34 @xmath35  .51 an agreement can be obtained between model calculation and experiments : high temperature ( ht ) susceptibility , magnetic specific heat , magnon dispersion .",
    "we consider the exchange constants determined in @xcite as the most reliable set .",
    "for the exchange constants in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction we rely on the ones determined by nishi et al @xcite .",
    "these are rather small , compared with the interactions in the ribbon .",
    "note however that from recent analysis of raman magnon spectra @xcite one finds indications for significant interchain superexchange interactions .",
    "this interchain exchange is probably also responsible for the disagreement between the frustration parameter determined from these spectra and from susceptibility and other data .",
    "also kuroe et al @xcite find a somewhat larger interchain exchange interaction in the @xmath7 direction from an analysis of raman spectra : @xmath36 mev .",
    "thus , whether the cu chain can safely be regarded as a 1d chain remains questionable",
    ".    in the sp phase one finds two alternating values for the @xmath1 exchange in the cu chain .",
    "this is usual expressed by : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the average @xmath1 exchange interaction in the sp phase , and @xmath39 are the two alternating values . the dimensionless quantity",
    "@xmath40 depends on the temperature . from table",
    "[ table : experimental exchange constants ] we see that the estimates of this parameter at @xmath41 k range from 0.014 to .3 , i.e. over one order of magnitude .",
    "gros et al find the best agreement with magnon spectra for an intermediate value .",
    "an important feature of the @xmath30@xmath32 model is that it predicts a spin  gap to develop in the magnetic excitation spectrum for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this gap opens irrespective of any lattice distortion .",
    "so a singlet spin liquid phase can originate either from the usual sp mechanism or from frustration of the antiferromagnetic order due to a relative strong @xmath32 exchange interaction .    based on the preliminary results of a study of the dependence of the exchange constants on the bond angles ( ) we proposed a microscopic mechanism for the sp transition in cugeo@xmath3 : in first approximation",
    "we attribute the main lattice changes as due to the change in the soft bond angles especially the angle which the ge ",
    "o bond makes with the cuo@xmath2 ribbon  the _ hinge _ angle ( @xmath43 ) , and the cu ",
    "o  cu _ bridge _ angle ( @xmath44 ) in this plaquette .    in fig .",
    "[ figure : harmonica model ] we present a simple picture of this model as applied to the distortion of the cugeo@xmath3 lattice when pressure is applied along the @xmath7axis .",
    "the two basic units of the structure ",
    "the cuo@xmath2 ribbon and the geo@xmath3 chain rotate around the shared o ions : the hinges .",
    "this hinge angle has a strong influence on the strength of the @xmath1 exchange in cugeo@xmath3 .",
    "we will see that its influence on the @xmath5 exchange is small .",
    "so , of interest for our model are the dependencies of these exchange constants on the lattice parameters .",
    "bchner et al ( 1996 ) @xcite have recently performed a study of the magnetostriction and thermal expansion of cugeo@xmath3 single crystals .",
    "they obtained for the pressure dependence of the susceptibility @xmath45 along the three principle axes @xmath46 at 60 k : the @xmath6axis -2.5 % / gpa , the @xmath7axis 5 % / gpa , and for pressure along the @xmath4axis : 1 % / gpa .",
    "these pressure dependencies are nearly constant from 20 k up to 60 k. assuming that in the paramagnetic phase at temperatures far above the sp transition temperature , the magnetic susceptibility follows a curie  weiss type law , one derives for the variation of the @xmath1 exchange in the ribbon with pressure @xmath47 , so : @xmath48 , + 11.5 and + 2.3 % /gpa , in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 direction , respectively .",
    "we assume that the other exchange contributions are either too small or are independent of pressure .    in order to interpret these magnetoelastic data with structural distortions we have to relate them to elastic data .",
    "we use the following elastic constants for an interpretation of these data : @xmath49 gpa ; @xmath50 gpa;@xmath51 gpa .",
    "we neglect off  diagonal elastic response .    first consider pressure along the b and c",
    " axes as these are most straightforward to interpret . assuming that most of the distortions due to the application of pressure are due to changes in the bond angles one finds for pressure along the @xmath4axis , the bridge angle is the softest structural parameter : @xmath52/gpa , while for pressure along the @xmath7axis the hinge angle is the most soft structural parameter : @xmath53/gpa , where the angle @xmath17(cu - o - cu ) is the bridge angle , and the angle @xmath19(ge - ribbon ) the hinge angle . for their values see table [ table : structure ] .",
    "the effect of pressure along the @xmath7axis on the structure is illustrated with a somewhat simplified version of fig .",
    "[ figure : harmonica model ] in fig .",
    "[ figure : simple harmonica model ] .",
    "the compression of the lattice due to pressure along the @xmath7axis changes the hinge angles @xmath43 while leaving the bond lengths nearly constant .",
    "pressure along the @xmath7axis can also cause a slight increase of the bridge angle , but we neglect this response of the lattice ; an increase in the bridge angle would cause a decrease of the o2o2 bondlength , which is already very small and thus very unlikely .",
    "such an increase of the bridge angle would make cugeo@xmath0 more antiferromagnetic , and when we ignore this change in @xmath54 we even somewhat underestimate the effect @xmath55 on @xmath30 .",
    "another structural distortion due to pressure along the @xmath4axis would be a buckling of the cuo@xmath12 chain .",
    "the effect of such a buckling on the exchange constants is probably small , and antiferromagnetic .",
    "so when we ignore this buckling effect we underestimate the effect of @xmath56 on @xmath30 .",
    "the data for pressure along the @xmath6axis are more difficult to translate into changes of a single bond angle .",
    "pressure along this axis would cause probably first a decrease of the van der waals gap between the layers .",
    "the next effect would be a decrease in the thickness of the these layers .",
    "this thickness is determined first by the ge ",
    " zag chain .",
    "so a compression of the layers can be accomplished by stretching the geo@xmath0 chain which will force an increase of the cu ",
    "o  cu bridge angles .",
    "however like we argued in the previous paragraph this increase of the bridge angle is counteracted by the repulsion of the two o2 bridge ions between two @xmath1 cu ions in the chain .",
    "furthermore , an increase of the tetrahedral angle at the ge which connects two cuo@xmath12 ribbons will flatten even more the geo@xmath0 chain .",
    "the latter could well lead to an increase in the distance between two ge neighbors in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "a variation of the hinge angle by a rotation around the o hinges of the two principle subunits is not susceptible directly to the @xmath6axis compression . a simple accordion effect increasing the @xmath7axis , i.e. a rotation around the o hinges , will not help in compressing the system in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "so altogether one can not make a straightforward estimate of the change in bridge angles induced by pressure along the @xmath6axis .",
    "assuming that each tetrahedral o  ge  o angle contributes half of the compression one can make an estimate of the change in the bridge angle . from this",
    "we expect that pressure along the @xmath6axis will have an effect opposite to pressure along the @xmath4axis , which would be about 2 to 3 times as large as the @xmath4axis effect .",
    "so we derive an increase of the bridge angle of about 2@xmath25 per gpa pressure along the @xmath6axis .",
    "this is about 5 times as large as for applying pressure along the @xmath4axis , while the change in susceptibility is only about 2.5 times as large . from this one",
    "might conclude that probably the largest change in the tetrahedral angle is the one connecting two cuo@xmath12 ribbons , i.e. the ge  o  ge angle in the @xmath7 direction , which does not force a change in the bridge angle , and agrees with the earlier argument of constant o2o2 distance .    for a detailed analysis of these data",
    "we refer to bchner et al ( 1997 ) @xcite .",
    "these data show that the magnetic properties are very sensitive to the hinge angle @xmath57 o  o  ge and bridge angle @xmath58 cu  o  cu , like we predicted @xcite .    from the above",
    "we derive that the @xmath1 exchange constant in the ribbon varies with these bond angles as follows .",
    "bchner et al ( 1997 ) finds from the shift of the sp transition temperature under applying pressure along the @xmath4axis a change in the @xmath1 exchange constant only due to the variation in the bridge angle : @xmath59 % /@xmath25 , and applying pressure along the @xmath7axis a variation in the @xmath1 exchange only due to a variation in the hinge angle : @xmath60 % /@xmath25 .",
    "this analysis of the variations of the exchange constant with pressure in terms of bond angles are based on the assumption of rigid bond lengths , and that only one soft bond angle varies with pressure applied along each principle direction ( @xmath7 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "this simple analysis is not applicable for @xmath61 : in this case more than one bond angle is involved .",
    "another way to derive these variations would be to correlate the angular variation with the change in lattice constant as a function of temperature .",
    "for the hinge angle this leads to a twice as large variation and for the bridge angle to nearly the same variation with the lattice parameters .",
    "so we suggest that the uncertainty in the angular variation of the @xmath1 exchange constant derived above has an error of about 100 % and for the hinge angle a much smaller uncertainty caused by variations in the bridge angle .",
    "furthermore bchner et al ( 1997 ) find the following approximate relation between the variation of the sp transition temperature and the average susceptibility ( @xmath62 ) at 60 k : @xmath63/[\\delta \\overline{\\chi}/ \\delta p_i ] \\approx 1.5\\pm 0.4 $ ] 10@xmath64 k g / emu for all directions @xmath65 , @xmath7 , @xmath4 .",
    "let us assume that the sp transition temperature is proportional to the exchange constant .",
    "then we have for the linear variation of the @xmath1 exchange constant @xmath66 , and we find for the relative variations of the exchange constant in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 direction : @xmath67 .",
    "above we found for this relative variations from the analysis of the ht susceptibility approximately the same ratios : @xmath68 .      as is well  known an exchange between magnetic moments in insulating magnetic compounds based on late transition ",
    "metals is predominantly caused by the so  called superexchange .",
    "this superexchange is due to the overlap of the localized orbitals of the magnetic electrons with orbitals of intermediate nonmagnetic ligands .",
    "there are many processes contributing to superexchange , which appear under various names in various calculational schemes .",
    "nevertheless , usually the sum of these partial processes give results which follow the goodenough  kanamori  anderson ( gka ) @xcite rules .",
    "these rules are based on orbital symmetry considerations and the assumption that the most important covalent bonding is @xmath69 . according to these rules a 180@xmath10 superexchange ( the magnetic ion  ligand ",
    "magnetic ion angle is 180@xmath10 ) of partially filled @xmath70 shells with @xmath69 bonding , is antiferromagnetic , whereas a 90@xmath10 superexchange is weakly ferromagnetic .",
    "this qualitative difference between 180@xmath10 and 90@xmath10 superexchange is due to the fact that , when considering @xmath71 bonding only , in the former case the orbitals of the magnetic electrons are overlapping with the same ligand orbital , while in the latter case the magnetic orbitals are overlapping with different mutually orthogonal ligand orbitals . neglecting direct @xmath72 interactions ,",
    "the molecular orbitals , based on these atomic @xmath73 and @xmath70 orbitals , are orthogonal , and so there is only a ferromagnetic superexchange contribution .    obviously , when @xmath74 bonding and/or direct @xmath72 hybridization become important these rules do not hold anymore .",
    "also when in the 90@xmath10 case the orthogonality of the intermediate ligand orbitals is not strict the gka rules have to be modified .",
    "such is in fact the case for the @xmath1 superexchange along the @xmath4axis in cugeo@xmath3 , which has recently been discussed in detail by the present authors .",
    "there we have shown that in the case of 90@xmath10 superexchange one should not only take into account the local symmetry of the cation but also the symmetry at the anion position .",
    "when valence orbitals of the same type centered at an anion involved in spin transfer between the two cations have different hybridization with a side group , one can have an antiferromagnetic interaction instead of the ferromagnetic one predicted by the gka rules for 90@xmath10 superexchange .    in principle",
    "similar rules hold for the @xmath5 superexchange interactions . for the @xmath5 superexchange in the @xmath4 direction the spin from one cu",
    "can be transferred over two intermediate o@xmath73 orbitals to the other @xmath5 cu . in this case",
    "the o@xmath73 orbitals have a finite transfer with both @xmath5 magnetic cu@xmath70 orbitals .",
    "so these @xmath5 cu@xmath70 orbitals are not orthogonal , and this will lead to an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction ; if there is a finite transfer between two magnetic orbitals , kinetic exchange will usually win from the ferromagnetic direct or potential exchange .",
    "in the case of cugeo@xmath3 there are two such transfer paths ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nn and nnn exchange c - axis ] ) between @xmath5 s along the @xmath4axis .",
    "it is clear that this leads to a relatively large antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction . in the @xmath5 case the ferromagnetic kramers  anderson contribution , which is due to two ",
    "site cation@xmath70 anion@xmath73 exchange and which may cause the pure 90@xmath10 exchange to be ferromagnetic , is much smaller than the antiferromagnetic kinetic superexchange .    in section [ section : theory ]",
    "we consider the @xmath1 exchange along the @xmath4axis , using various schemes : perturbation theory , and an exact diagonalization of a cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquette .",
    "the effect of the ge side group attached to the bridging o pair is taken into account using two approaches .    in",
    "the _ first _ , most simple approach the influence of ge is taken into account by a shift of one of the @xmath73 orbitals ( @xmath75 ) , and a covalent reduction of the matrix elements containing this orbital .",
    "the hinge angle @xmath76 only appears to describe the effective hybridization between the ge@xmath77 and this @xmath75 orbitals .    in a _",
    "second _ approach to describe the influence of the side group ge on the o@xmath73 levels we rotate these o - p orbitals of the o  o bridge so that one obtains a @xmath71 bonding between o@xmath75 and the ge@xmath77 hybrid .",
    "the states in the planar ge  o ",
    "o  ge cluster can easy be diagonalized .",
    "this is described in appendix [ appendix : explicit side group effect ] .",
    "we study these @xmath1 and @xmath5 exchange interactions as a function of the lattice parameters .",
    "we find that perturbation theory , giving quite reasonable results for the exchange constants themselves , is not able to describe their dependence on the bond angles as found from the analysis of the pressure dependence of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we find that an exact diagonalization of the cu@xmath2o@xmath2 plaquette is more successful in this respect , and results of this approach can be found in section [ section : cluster model ] .",
    "the reason that the exact diagonalization of the cluster model gives better results compared with the fourth  order perturbation expansion is that in the perturbation approach the angular dependence is mainly caused by the hybridization , the splitting of the levels being constant . in the case of an exact diagonalization the changes in the hybridization are partly compensated by the changes in the level splitting .",
    "because of the large ratio of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 exchange , the question arises whether one should also take into account an exchange interaction along the @xmath4axis with neighbors further away . in order to do this",
    "systematically we use a band model for the electronic structure of the nonmagnetic anion states .",
    "such a model has been described by one of the present authors @xcite . in this model",
    "we only consider two cations at a distance r , each with one nondegenerate half  filled @xmath70like state , interacting via a fully  occupied valence band , consisting of mainly anion @xmath73 states . in this case one",
    "obtains a closed set of equations in terms of two  particle green functions .",
    "we have taken into account @xmath78 as well as @xmath79 bonding .",
    "the effect of the ge side group is easily taken into account within the simple scheme , by shifting the energy of the @xmath73 levels and by introducing a covalent reduction parameter for the matrix elements involving these o@xmath73 orbitals . in this approach",
    "we only calculate the contribution corresponding to the kinetic exchange and correlation exchange mechanism .",
    "the contributions stemming from the two ",
    "site @xmath80 exchange and from the anion on ",
    "site @xmath81 exchange are calculated in fourth ",
    "order perturbation theory . in section [ section : band model ] we give a short account of the application of this model to cugeo@xmath3 .    in section [ section : nnn a+b+c exchange ]",
    "we consider using perturbation theory the exchange interactions along the @xmath6 and @xmath7axis .",
    "an estimate of these superexchange constants is of importance because these determine whether one can safely consider cugeo@xmath0 a 1d heisenberg spin system or one has also to take into account these superexchange interactions in case they are of comparable magnitude to the ones along the @xmath4axis .",
    "the exchange transfer paths are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : nn and nnn exchange b - axis ] , and [ figure : nn and nnn exchange a - axis ] .",
    "note first that in both cases there are two exchange transfer paths for the @xmath1 interactions , and there is a transfer path to the @xmath5 cu in both these directions , which partly coincides with the one of the @xmath1 transfer paths .",
    "because the o  o bond length is in the @xmath6axis case much longer than in the @xmath7axis case , it is clear that the spin transfer along the @xmath7axis is stronger then along the @xmath6axis .",
    "so we expect that the kinetic superexchange interactions between the cuo@xmath12 ribbons in the @xmath7 direction are larger than in the @xmath6 direction . in the @xmath7 direction",
    "we expect a weak antiferromagnetic interaction , and in the @xmath6 direction an even weaker antiferromagnetic or even weak ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "an important clue for the microscopic picture of the sp transition stems from a comparison of the magnetic properties of weak doping by zn for cu and si for ge .",
    "one finds in both cases that a small amount of impurities has an appreciable lowering effect on the sp transition temperature . that small substitutions of si for ge has a large effect on",
    "the sp transition is at first sight difficult to understand , because ge and si ions are only indirectly involved in the @xmath1 superexchange interaction in the cu chains .",
    "however closer examination shows that the si ion has a number of effects on @xmath1 superexchange along the @xmath4axis .",
    "first , because si@xmath82 has a smaller ionic radius than ge@xmath82 , it causes one of the cu ",
    "o  cu angles of the cuo@xmath2 plaquette to decrease , and secondly it may increase the cu  o bond length .",
    "furthermore , this o bonded to si is taken out of the cuo@xmath2 ribbon plane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : si substitution ] .",
    "all these small geometrical changes add to a relative large absolute decrease in the kinetic exchange coming from the cu ",
    "o  cu transfer path to which si is attached . due to this relative local distortion of the o ",
    "hinge , i.e. the hinges of the accordion model , the accordion motion becomes frustrated .",
    "this distortion inhibits an easy rotation of the cuo@xmath2 ribbon w.r.t . the geo@xmath3 chain .",
    "si is attached to two cuo@xmath2 ribbons and so is twice as effective as zn on a cu position to destroy the ordered sp phase .",
    "we discuss the consequences of this substitution for @xmath1 superexchange in the @xmath4 direction in section [ section : substitutions ] .",
    "let us first discuss the @xmath1 exchange interaction along the @xmath4axis because these seem to be of major importance for an understanding of the magnetic properties of cugeo@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath1 superexchange involves spin exchange over two 90@xmath10 cation  anion  cation transfer paths .",
    "expressions for the various contributions to superexchange for this configuration have been presented before in a discussion of effects due to side groups  bonded to the bridging o ligands of two magnetic cations  on superexchange @xcite .",
    "there we emphasized especially these side group effects in a more general context .",

    "changes in this angle as a function of temperature , pressure and phase are  as we will see  the principal causes for the changes of the @xmath1 exchange interaction along the ribbon . and thus a study of the sensitivity of the exchange interactions for these induced changes in the lattice parameters can be important for an understanding of the mechanism of the sp transition in cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , this hinge angle is very susceptible to pressure along the @xmath7axis . in this case the cuo@xmath2 ribbons are rigid units , rotating with respect to the rigid chain of geo@xmath93 coupled tetrahedra : the accordion model ( see fig .",

    "another factor which may influence the doping dependence of the sp transition is that zn and si act differently on the frustration : if one takes into account the @xmath5 exchange interaction , a zn  doped chain will be still totally antiferromagnetic ( albeit with weakened af exchange between cu s across zn ) , whereas si , with the @xmath32 included will render the corresponding bond either completely frustrated , or even ferromagnetic .",
    "it is this factor which possibly explains why si doping is not twice but even three times more effective in suppressing the sp phase than the zn ones",
    "the fourth  order perturbation expansion usually used in the calculation of superexchange constants , is also successful in the case of the various exchange interactions in cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "we find good agreement of our calculations with experiment .",
    "we find a value for the frustration parameter ( see table [ table : exchange constants ] ) which is in the range of values found in literature ( see table [ table : experimental exchange constants ] ) .",
    "also the values for the two alternating exchange constants in the sp phase is in the range of values found in the literature ( see also table [ table : experimental exchange constants ] .",
    "the exchange in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction are in our perturbation scheme nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath1 exchange in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "however the results for the angular dependence of the @xmath1 superexchange using this perturbation approach differ by nearly an order of magnitude from the experimental data .",
    "also further refinements in the treatment of the o  o bridge and the hybridization between these o and the ge side group give no improvement ; on the contrary , the disagreement for the angular dependence with experiment increases .    in this perturbation scheme",
    "the transfer matrix elements depend on these angles . in the formulation of the superexchange",
    "these are the only ingredients which depend on the angle .",
    "the excitation energies do not depend on the transfer integrals .",
    "however , we know that in general these also may depend on the size of the transfer integrals .",
    "this is usually neglected , and the transfer integrals and excitation energy are taken from some tight  binding fit to an electronic bandstructure or cluster calculation , so that actually one takes the energy of the perturbed states : one thus renormalizes the excitation energies .",
    "the energy differences of these perturbed states have a second order dependence on the transfer integrals .",
    "when the unperturbed energy differences are of the same order as the transfer integrals , these energies become very sensitive to changes in the transfer integrals .",
    "this is actually the case in cugeo@xmath0 .    in order to take into account simultaneously changes in matrix elements and in the excitation energies , we perform an exact diagonalization of a cu@xmath12o@xmath12 cluster , using essentially the same model as in the perturbation approach .",
    "we calculated the energy difference of the singlet and triplet state . in this approach",
    "the results for all exchange interactions and the dependence of the @xmath1 exchange on the bond angles compare well with available experimental data . the shift in excitation energy due to the change in bond angles compensates partly the change in the transfer integrals .",
    "the consequence is that the @xmath1 exchange in the ribbon is much less sensitive to changes in the lattice parameters .",
    "we obtain rather small  nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath215 exchange in the @xmath4 direction ",
    "values for the exchange in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction .",
    "we also find a rather small next@xmath5 exchange in the @xmath4 direction from our solution of the band model .",
    "thus from our calculation it follows that one can view this compound as a frustrated 1d spin system with @xmath1 and @xmath5 exchange in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "we calculated the consequences of the substitution of ge by si , using the perturbation approach .",
    "due to the decrease in the bridge angle @xmath54 , and the increase in the hinge angle @xmath216 the @xmath1 exchange in the ribbon decreases strongly .",
    "we know that the perturbation approach overestimates the sensitivity of exchange for these lattice changes .",
    "however even a much smaller change in the @xmath1 exchange , for example a decrease by only 50 % , would have drastic consequences , because such a value would effectively frustrate the exchange interaction : @xmath1 and @xmath5 exchange then become approximately the same , which may introduce kink in the long  range order .",
    "the values for the alternating exchange constant in the sp phase are of the right order of magnitude ; note however that the analysis of the experimental data give values which differ by an order of magnitude ( see discussion in the introduction ) .",
    "another consequence of this model is an elastic one .",
    "the rotation of the two 1d sublattices cuo@xmath12 and geo@xmath0 around the shared oxygen becomes frustrated in case of substitution of si for ge : the si  o bond is shorter than the ge  o bond .",
    "rotation of these two units would then also involve a change in the cu  o bondlengths : increase of the hinge angle would increase the cu ",
    "o bond length , in order to accommodate the si  o bond length .",
    "thus we expect that si doped cugeo@xmath0 shows a less strong dependence of the susceptibility on applying pressure along the @xmath7axis .",
    "in this paper we carried out microscopic calculations of the exchange constants in cugeo@xmath0 and studied their dependence on the lattice parameters . our treatment in this paper allows to explain many features of this compound , which at first glance look rather puzzling , such as the observed sensibility for pressure applied perpendicular to the cuo@xmath12 ribbons , and the sensitivity of the @xmath1 exchange along the @xmath4axis to si doping    we show how the account taken of the local geometry and the side groups ge and si lead to a rather detailed microscopic picture of the distortions in cugeo@xmath0 , both above and below the sp transition .",
    "these results are largely specific for this particular compound , although some of the conclusions ( for example the role of side groups in superexchange and the importance of soft bond bending modes ) are of a more general nature .",
    "we conclude that a perturbation approach is valid for the calculation of the superexchange parameters for a fixed set of lattice parameters , but when one wants to study the dependence of these exchange parameters on the lattice parameters one has to take into account also the shift of the energy levels . only in the limit of very ionic compounds",
    "these shifts are too small to be of significance . a cluster model  in our case cu@xmath12o@xmath12  and also a band model for the anion ( o ) states give results that compare well with experiment .",
    "we conclude also that the @xmath1 exchange in the cuo@xmath12 ribbon is most sensitive to changes in the hinge angle .",
    "the other exchange interactions , in the ribbon and between ribbons , are rather insensitive to the side group ge .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath1 exchange to the changes in the lattice is due to the strong interference effects which are not present in the case of the other exchange interactions : @xmath5 in @xmath4 direction , and @xmath1 in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 direction .",
    "this sensitivity to the side groups is also the cause of the large influence of si substitution on the @xmath1 exchange .",
    "the presence of the two one  dimensional sublattices : the cuo@xmath12 ribbon and the geo@xmath0 chain , which can easy rotate with respect to each other around the shared o ions  the accordion model  is the basis for the understanding of the properties of this inorganic spin  peierls compound .",

    "in this appendix we give the expressions for the covalency parameters in case we take into account explicitly the o - ge @xmath155 hybridization . on the ge we only consider a @xmath94 hybridized orbital pointing in the direction of the o in the ribbon , hybridizing with the o@xmath95 orbital .",
    "the o@xmath204 orbital points along the ribbon , and therefore the o@xmath86 orbital are not hybridizing with the @xmath77 hybrids .",
    "we neglect again @xmath217 bonding . for more details see the main text . note that we now also have to include the @xmath92 orbitals on the o , because they have a component in the cuo@xmath2 ribbon plane .",
    "the @xmath86 are not affected , these remain in the ribbon , perpendicular to the ge-@xmath218 hybrid .",
