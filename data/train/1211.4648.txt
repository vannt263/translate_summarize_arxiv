    "the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) formalism is a venerable method for obtaining information on bound state systems in a covariant framework@xcite .",
    "it is , however , technically challenging and most applications to hadronic physics have been made in simple models@xcite or in two - body systems@xcite .",
    "only recently has the rather formidable extension to nucleons been undertaken@xcite .    because the bethe - salpeter formalism is covariant , it is especially useful for describing dynamical quantities such as form factors and distribution functions",
    ". it is also a many - body approach and thus can incorporate chiral symmetry breaking , which is crucial to obtaining reliable predictions in the light hadron spectrum@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these benefits come at a cost .",
    "the bethe - salpeter formalism hinges on the assumed form of a two - body irreducible scattering kernel , and this form must be obtained with some truncation  a truncation that must be made with no apparent small parameter in sight .",
    "this theoretical issue can become acute because truncated kernels often lead to bizarre predictions such as ` ghost states'@xcite , nonsensical spectra , or unphysical parameter - dependence of observables .",
    "even this undesirable situation can be a distant goal .",
    "often one simply postulates a kernel and tests the accuracy of its predictions .",
    "of course this removes all putative connections to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the bethe - salpeter formalism devolves to a ( quite sophisticated ) quark model .    here",
    "we explore the extension of the bethe - salpeter approach to the gluonic sector of the strong interactions  namely the glueball spectrum .",
    "to our knowledge this is the first attempt at computing glueball masses with the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "it is also a rare example of a hadronic computation that uses qcd to build the interaction kernel@xcite .",
    "thus we seek to leave the realm of pure model - building and enter one in which field - theoretic truncations become the relevant issue .",
    "we will , for example , assume that dressed versions of the lowest order kernel dominates the interaction .",
    "thus the ingredients necessary for this investigation are gluon , ghost , and quark propagators and the three - gluon , four - gluon , quark - gluon , and ghost - gluon vertices .",
    "it is clear that the problem is formidable , even at this simple level of truncation .    ensuring the fidelity of the truncations employed is not straightforward .",
    "we are therefore fortunate that a variety of lattice gauge computations of two - point functions have been performed recently",
    ". our strategy will be to model vertices , employ these vertices in schwinger - dyson equations for two - point functions , verify the solutions against lattice computations , and then use the resulting suite of @xmath0-point functions in the glueball bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "unfortunately , this is difficult to implement in practice because the gluon two - point function is notoriously truncation - dependent@xcite .",
    "we therefore choose to use the lattice ghost and gluon propagators directly in the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we start by defining the various propagators and vertices used in this work .",
    "the two - body bethe - salpeter equation for gluonic states is then developed and applied to even charge conjugation scalar glueballs .",
    "model parameters are tuned against lattice gauge theory results and finally , we test the fidelity of the computation by comparing model computations of the relevant two - point functions to lattice results . although a reasonably good spectrum is obtained , the comparison to two - point functions indicates that substantial truncation error occurs and further work is required to obtain robust qcd - based predictions of hadronic properties in the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "quark , gluon , and ghost propagators are defined in terms of dressing functions as follows :    @xmath1    the scattering kernel that underpins the bethe - salpeter formalism can be formally written in terms of schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "of course these equations must be truncated at some point .",
    "it is traditional to organise the equations in terms @xmath0-point functions and truncate at the two- or three - point level .",
    "we will follow tradition here and thus construct the two particle irreducible four - point function via dressed tree - level interactions .",
    "details will be provided in the next section  here",
    "we focus on the dressed vertices .      in the case of abelian gauge theory ,",
    "the ward - takahaski identity can be used to completely constrain the longitudinal dependence of the full fermion - gauge boson vertex .",
    "the result is given in terms of the fermion dressing functions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and is called the ball - chiu vertex@xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the nonabelian case because the ghost dressing function and the quark - ghost scattering kernel , @xmath4 appear in the slavnov - taylor identity :    p_3^^a_(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = i g_0 t^a h(p_3 ) [ s^-1(-p_1 ) k_g(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) -     the resulting vertex has a rich structure that was studied by aguilar and papavasilliou@xcite .",
    "they found that an adequate approximation to the full longitudinal structure of the vertex can be obtained by neglecting the quark - gluon scattering kernel and multiplying the ball - chiu vertex by the ghost dressing function .",
    "we make the further simplification of retaining only the ` central ' term ( proportion to a gamma matrix ) of the ball - chiu vertex : _",
    "^a(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = - i g_0 t^a _ h^n(p_1-p_2 ) [ a(p_1)+a(p_2 ) ] .",
    "[ qg - vertex ]    a well - known shortcoming of the ball - chiu approach is that the transverse part of the vertex function remains unspecified .",
    "this has been partly remedied in the abelian case by requiring multiplicative renormalisability in the asymptotic regime@xcite .",
    "no such ansatz exists for the nonabelian case and we choose to neglect this contribution henceforth .",
    "however , aguilar and papavasilliou note that the correct perturbative asymptotic behaviour for the quark propagator is not obtained with this approximation  presumably due to the missing transverse components of the vertex .",
    "they then observe that supplying an extra power of the ghost propagator in eq .",
    "[ qg - vertex ] ( @xmath5 ) allows recovery of the expected asymptotic behaviour .",

    "[ fig - gluon - gap ] , has a rich structure that makes obtaining definitive numerical solutions notoriously difficult@xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt the simple expedient of employing a fit to the lattice gauge results .",
    "it is important to note that this is not just a simple matter of finding a parameterization that mimics the data in a reasonable way because solving the glueball bethe - salpeter equation requires knowledge of the gluon propagator in the minkowski regime .",

    "[ eq - b - gap ]  [ eq - h - gap ] follows tradition in that vertex renormalisation factors are made explicit .",
    "however , this is in fact not necessary , or even desirable : once a vertex model has been adopted it can be regarded as renormalised ( just like the quark dressing functions ) and hence the renormalisation factors can simply be absorbed into the vertex factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the coupled bs equations have been solved using a number of strategies .",
    "the simplest approach assumes the ` angle approximation ' wherein all angular dependence of the kernel , @xmath73 , is neglected .",
    "remarkable simplification ensues and the eigenvalue problem can be easily and accurately solved .",

    "the alternate fit ( eq . [ eq - b - fit-2 ] ) does not yield physically acceptable results : the eigenvalues never cross unity for reasonable couplings and are not monotonic in the coupling strength  indicating that the solutions are anomalous .",
    "it is thus clear that the spectrum is sensitive to the form of the analytic continuation of the gluon propagator into the minkowski region and to the vertex models employed in the kernel .",
    "we have attempted to find a consistent description of the ghost and quark propagators and the low lying scalar and pseudoscalar glueball spectrum with the schwinger - dyson / bethe - salpeter formalism and the lattice gluon propagator as input . while a reasonably good description of all of the quantities was obtained ,",
    "the couplings required to obtain such descriptions were drastically different ( @xmath80 for the quark propagator , @xmath81 for the ghost propagator , and @xmath82 for the glueball spectrum ) .",
    "furthermore , recall that gauge covariance and our renormalisation choices require that @xmath83 .",
    "direct computation of these renormalisation constants yields @xmath84 while @xmath85 at @xmath86 gev .",
    "this 35% discrepancy again points to quite large residual truncation - dependence .",
    "it thus appears that a consistent description of simple properties of qcd remains to be achieved . in particular",
    ", the effective strength of the gluonic interaction in the model glueball kernel is much too large .",
    "a variety of theoretical and practical issues bedevil this work . amongst",
    "the former are the breaking of gauge invariance and even renormalisability that occur when truncations to schwinger - dyson equations are made .",
    "finding truncation schemes that retain fundamental properties of the lagrangian is clearly a desirable goal . on the practical side ,",
    "even simple two - point functions are strongly dependent on model assumptions . as an illustration of the issues involved",
    ", the kugo - ojima confinement criterion specifies that the ghost dressing function @xmath87 approaches infinity at the origin@xcite . the lattice ( and our computation ) thus do not agree with this requirement , implying that something vital is missing in our understanding of the infrared properties of qcd .",
    "there are , of course , more direct sources of possible trouble .",
    "for example , it is clearly desirable to compute the gluon propagator so that the analytic continuation to the minkowski region can be made with some reliability .",
    "vertex models need to be vetted and improved as much as possible .",
    "gauge invariance needs to be maintained to the level of accuracy desired in the numerical outcomes . and",
    "the effects of topological or many - gluon terms in the interaction kernel need to be investigated .",
    "it will be of interest to include quark effects in the computation .",
    "lastly , an attempt at noncovariant gauges such as coulomb or axial gauge should be illuminating@xcite .",
