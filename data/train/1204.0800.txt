    "non - relativistic jets are observed in the vicinities of many protostellar objects , young stellar objects ( ysos ) and post - agb stars .",
    "plausible models suggest that jets are launched and collimated by a symbiosis of accretion , rotation and magnetic mechanisms , which occur at the jet `` central engine '' ( see @xcite , for a review ) . the jet material must be accelerated to velocities beyond the escape speed and magnetically mediated",
    "launch models are often favoured because they can provide the needed directed momentum ( see livio 2004 , pudritz 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "astrophysical jets are expected to be poynting flux dominated ( pfd ) close to their engine .",
    "it is however unclear how far from the launch region the poynting flux continues to dominate over kinetic energy flux , or whether the jets eventually become essentially hydrodynamic @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two possibilities is a difference between two magnetically launched outflow classes : ( 1 ) magnetocentrifugal jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which magnetic fields only dominate out to the alfvn radius , or ( 2 ) poynting flux dominated magnetic tower jets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in which magnetic fields dominate the jet structure , acting as a magnetic piston over very large distances from the engine .",
    "indeed , magnetic fields with initially poloidal ( radial and vertical ) dominant geometries anchored to accretion discs have been shown to form tall , highly wound and helical magnetic structures , or magnetic towers , that expand vertically when laterally supported in pressure equilibrium with the ambient gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "pfd jets carry large electric currents which generate strong , tightly wound helical magnetic fields around the jet axis .",
    "simulations of such jets have found that magnetic fields play a role in the formation of current - driven kink instabilities and the stabilization of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) modes ( e.g. see @xcite ) . however , while the correlation between the mechanical power of astrophysical jets and their main observable features ( e.g. length , velocity , cocoon geometry , etc . )",
    "has been widely studied for kinetic - energy dominated jets , this is not the case for pfd magnetic tower jets .",
    "recently , magnetized jets have been produced in laboratory experiments .",
    "these flows appear to exhibit key aspects of magnetic tower evolution ( @xcite ) . in these experiments ,",
    "performed on pulsed power current generators , the local injection of purely toroidal magnetic energy produced high mach number ( @xmath120 ) , fully radiative and fully magnetized jets .",
    "these magnetic towers exhibit poynting flux dominated cavities with @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures ) which expand supersonically into an unmagnetized ambient medium . within the cavity , a central jet forms via hoop stresses . while the body of these jets has @xmath4 , their core is a high @xmath3 , kinetic energy dominated flow .",
    "the central jet evolution of these experiments also showed the growth of current - driven , non - linear instabilities , in particular the kink , @xmath51 , mode . as a result ,",
    "the laboratory jets are eventually corrugated and become a collimated chain of magnetized `` clumps '' @xcite .",
    "these experiments were then modeled via resistive mhd simulations specifically developed for laboratory studies @xcite , where the details of the flow , including current distributions , were followed .",
    "the break - up of the jet into a sequence of collimated clumps has been suggested as an explanation for clumpy flows observed in yso outflow systems ( hartigan & morse 2007 ; yirak et al .",
    "2010 ; hartigan et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we note that the effect of plasma cooling via optically thin radiation has not been followed before in simulations of magnetic tower jets .",
    "studies of weakly magnetized , kinetic energy - dominated jets show that this type of cooling can make the flow more susceptible to instabilities , such as kh modes ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite studied magnetocentrifugally launched jets with 2d radiation - mhd simulations .",
    "ohsuga et al .",
    "found that the strength of radiative cooling , which they control by changing the plasma density , affects the structure and evolution of both accretion disks and their associate jets .",
    "although we follow thermal energy losses in the present study , we do not compute radiate transfer . in this paper",
    "we study the effects that thermal energy losses and rotation , independently of one another , have on the stability of pfd magnetic towers . for comparison",
    "we also run simulations of collimated asymptotically hd jets .",
    "such hd jets could represent the asymptotic propagation regimes of magneto - centrifugally launched flows , which are distinct from pfd ones in that the latter remain dominated by magnetic flux out to much larger distances .",
    "our comparison allows us to articulate how pdf flows differ from their hydrodynamic counterparts .",

    "the pre - collimated hd jet can only expand radially via a much lower thermal pressure .",
    "thus all of the energy flux in the hydro - case for our set up is more efficiently directed to axial mechanical power . moreover , the towers and the hydro jet show different structures : towers have a thin central jet which is susceptible to instabilities , whereas the hd jet s beam is thicker , smoother and stable .",
    "we consistently see lower densities in the pfd tower cavities than in that of the hd case .",

    "such regions are located between the reverse an forward slow - mode compressive mhd waves ( figure  [ vels ] , left and middle columns ) , and filled with subsonic , weakly magnetized plasma .",
    "this high-@xmath3 region is strongly affected by cooling ( right column ) which reduces the thermal energy ( see also figure  [ temp ] ) .",
    "hence the total pressure of the surrounding plasma becomes further dominated by the magnetic component , and it collapses yielding higher compression ratios than the adiabatic case .",
    "the field in the cooling case also takes on a configuration amenable to instability . thus the plasma in the high-@xmath3 jet - core region",

    "these figures show that the inward lorentz force ( top panels ) is slightly stronger than both the inertial ( or specific centrifugal @xmath109 ) , and the thermal pressure , @xmath110 , forces which push plasma outward .",

    "the jets are self - confined in the current - free region located at a few jet radii from the core ( i.e. hoop stress ) . at larger radii , near the towers contact surface , which is also the return current surface ( blue outer region in figure  [ curr ] ) , the magnetic pressure is weak and thus it only requires a mild ambient pressure ( light - grey outer region , figure  [ beta ] ) to confine the outer part of the towers .",

    "this can be understood with the bottom panel in figure  [ fforces ] where we see that the magnetic flux that is injected into the towers ( within model @xmath114 ; section  [ 221 ] ) causes not only axial ( @xmath19 ) expansion , but also radial expansion via magnetic pressure .",
    "in contrast , the kinetic - energy flux in the hd jet ( not shown ) is overwhelmingly axial .",
    "the structure and expansion of our pfd magnetic tower jets are affected by current - driven instabilities .",
    "we see evidence of the pinch , @xmath50 , the kink , @xmath51 , and the @xmath52 normal mode perturbations .",
    "these are expected in expanding magnetized plasma columns and consistent with the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and ciardi et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) but see also @xcite and also with the laboratory experiments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the kink perturbations grow and lead to instabilities in the cooling tower , firstly , and later also in the rotating tower .",
    "perturbations with modes @xmath50 and  2 develop in the adiabatic jet after expanding for @xmath11580yr ( @xmath11670% of the total simulation running time ) .",
    "these are caused by radial gradients in the magnetic fields located within the jet beam , at the boundary of the current - free , force - free region .",
    "the thermal and magnetic components of the total pressure balance each others perturbations locally . as a result",
    ", the core of the adiabatic jet becomes a helical column with an elliptical cross - section .",
    "the growth rate of these m=0 and m=2 perturbations is @xmath117120yr , which is longer than the simulation final time .",
    "thus we are seeing only the linear develop of the modes .",
    "finally we note resemblances ( figure  [ dens ] , bottom left panel ) to structures seen in the s@xmath118 emission distribution of the jet in hh  34 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the central part of the towers jet beams are high beta plasma columns where @xmath119 ( figure  [ bratio ] , @xmath120 ) . to understand their development we can appeal to standard kruskal - shafranov criterion for the kink instability , namely @xcite    @xmath121    where @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the characteristic wavelength of the current - driven perturbations . in figure  [ vels ] ( right column )",
    "we see that the cooling jet s core shows @xmath1241 ( @xmath12545 at time@xmath12684yr , and @xmath125611 at time@xmath126118yr ) .",
    "this means that the cooling tower does not have sufficient thermal energy , in comparison with the adiabatic and rotating cases , to balance the magnetic pressure kink perturbations .",
    "this is consistent with what we see in the towers density and temperature maps , figures  2 and  4 .",
    "in addition , we see that the jet core radius of the cooling tower is about 20% smaller than that of the adiabatic tower .",
    "this is consistent with what is found in laboratory experiments of magnetized supersonic jets , in which outflows with different cooling rates are compared ( ciardi et  al .",
    "2012 , in prep ) .",
    "both of these effects ( thermal energy losses and core radial compression ) reduce the right hand side of ( [ insta ] ) , making the system more susceptible to the growth of kink instabilities in the cooling tower .    for the rotating case , we find that rotation at the base of the jet beam , equation  ( [ vel ] ) , causes a progressive , slow amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component of the jet .",
    "this process is evident in the four panels at the bottom left of figure  [ vels ] , where we see that in general the alfvn speed is higher in the rotating case ( middle column ) than in the adiabatic one ( left column ) .",
    "this growth is likely sufficient to amplify the left hand side of equation  ( [ insta ] ) pushing the jet into the unstable regime .",
    "since the field grows linearly with the differential rotation , the growth rate is likely proportional to the imposed amount of rotation .",
    "we have not tested this as we have used only one vale of the differential rotation .",
    "note that the towers are not completely destroyed even when unstable , and the amplitude of the kink perturbations in the jet are about twice its radius ( figure  [ lines ] ) , in agreement with the kruskal - shafranov criterion @xcite .",
    "in addition to the four simulations presented above , we have carried out two variations of the hd jet run : one with cooling , and one which has a base rotation profile which follows equation  ( [ vel ] ) , just as in the rotating magnetic tower run ( section  [ models ] ) .",
    "we found that the results of the cooling hd jet simulation were consistent , as expected , with those found in previous similar studies , i.e. thin jet - produced shocks with high compression factors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the regimes",
    "we have studied , the propagation and structure of the hd jets is affected by both cooling and rotation in ways which have been studied before and which do not alter the global propagation properties of the flow , i.e. no instabilities are introduced as in the magnetic tower case .",
    "the results of the simulations help guide our understanding of the evolution of pfd magnetic towers . in particular the simulations show new details of the cavity - jet connection , the evolution of the tower given different assumptions ( cooling , rotation , etc . ) as well as providing some insight into the stability properties of the central jets which form in the flow .    for non - relativistic collimated flows magnetic towers",
    "have been proposed as mechanisms for launching some classes of yso . while the flows downstream at observable distances ( @xmath127au ) seem to be kinetic energy dominated , at smaller scales a pfd region",
    "may be expected . as hartigan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have shown , what few measurements of magnetic fields exist in yso jets indicate there must be a region of sub - alvnic , pfd dominated flow on scales of order 100au or less .",
    "in addition , these simulations demonstrate ( and as laboratory experiments have shown ) the long term evolution of magnetic towers may yield a series of collimated clumps whose magnetization properties vary over time . in this way pfd flows may evolve into kinetic energy dominated jets at large distances from the central engine . planetary nebula",
    "( pn ) offer another potential application of non - relativistic pfd dominated flows .",
    "magnetic fields are already expected to play an important role in launching pre - planetary nebulae ( ppn ) based on an observed mismatch between momentum in the ppn flow and momentum available through radiation .",
    "a number of papers have discussed how strong magnetic fields might create ppn or pn collimated flows ( blackman et al .",
    "2001a , b , frank & blackman 2004 , matt , frank & blackman 2006 ) .",
    "observations of ppn and pn offer morphological similarities to the kinds of features seen in our simulations , such as hollow lobes and axial clumps .",
    "future work might address these connections .    of particular importance",
    "is the connection between the models presented in this paper and recent `` laboratory astrophysics '' experiments .",
    "these studies utilized pulsed power technologies and were successful in creating high mach number , fully radiative , magnetized outflows ( lebedev et al . 2005 , ciardi et al . 2007 , ampleford et al . 2008 , ciardi et al . 2009 , frank et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the outflows were created when tw  electrical pulses ( 1ma , 250ns ) are applied to a radial array of fine metallic wires .",
    "lorentz forces ablated plasma from the wires creating an ambient plasma above the array .",
    "after the complete ablation of wires near the central electrode , the current switches to the plasma and creates a magnetic cavity with a central jet ( i.e. a magnetic tower ) .",
    "the central part of the jet is confined and accelerated by the pressure of the toroidal field .",
    "return current flows along the walls of the magnetic cavity , which is in turn confined by the thermal pressure and by inertia of the ambient plasma .",
    "as the magnetic cavity expands , the jet becomes detached and propagates away from the source at @xmath116200kms@xmath48 .",
    "instabilities which resemble the kink mode ( @xmath1281 ) develop within the body of these jets fragmenting them into well collimated structures with characteristic axial non - uniformities .",
    "thus the evolution of magnetic towers in the laboratory show a range of features that are strikingly similar to what is seen in our simulations .",
    "this concordance is all the more noteworthy in that our initial conditions were in no way tuned to the experiments and are , in fact , a modified version of what can be found in a number of purely astrophysical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus it appears that the laboratory experiments and the simulations support each other , as well as the conclusion that both are revealing generic properties of pfd outflows .",
    "while we did not study relativistic outflows , some aspects of the comparative behavior between hd and pfd jets revealed by our models might still apply .",
    "the fragmentation of the pfd magnetic tower core , for example , implies that rather than continuous jet beams we would expect high resolution observations to reveal essentially `` clumpy '' jets with a distribution of velocities , densities and magnetization . in this way our models , except the cooling ones , can be considered to articulate classes of flow features in agn radio jets @xcite , x - ray binaries @xcite and , perhaps , grbs @xcite . but",
    "both relativistic and different radiative cooling generalizations are needed to confirm or refute the implications of our present calculations for such regimes .",
    "there is opportunity for future work to focus more closely on the links with the laboratory experiments . in particular",
    ", issues related to the development of kink mode instabilities , their non - linear resolution and the evolution of clumpy magnetized jets should be explored more fully and in more detail .",
    "regarding the effect of rotation at the base of the jets on their stability , we note that @xcite have carried out 3-d simulations of magnetocentrifugally driven , conical jets , and found that kink instabilities are stronger when a rigid rotation profile is imposed , in comparison to a keplerian rotation profile .",
    "rigid rotation seems to induce a shearless magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison with our calculations must be made carefully though ; our initial magnetic configuration has a dominant toroidal component and no radial component , while the initial field setup of @xcite is purely radial .",
    "also , our rotating magnetic tower is continually affected by injection of magnetic flux , which is not the case of the conical jets of @xcite .",
    "we have carried out 3-d ideal mhd simulations of pfd and hd dominated jets to compare their structure and evolution subject to the same injected energy flux , and to study the effects of cooling and jet rotation on the jet stability .",
    "we note that our hd cases can , in principle , emulate asymptotic propagation regimes of magneto - centrifugally launched jets if those jets become kinetic energy dominated at large distances .",
    "magnetic towers will however remain pfd at large radii .",
    "our simulations read us to the following conclusions .",
    "helical localized magnetic fields injected into a region of low pressure will launch pfd , magnetic towers via magnetic pressure gradients .",
    "towers consist of a low density low beta plasma , the radial collimation of which is caused by the pressure of the external plasma . within the towers a higher density , higher beta jet forms collimated by the magnetic field lines located within the cavity .",
    "we found that pfd jets create structures that are more susceptible to instabilities relative to purely hydrodynamical jets given the same injected energy flux .",
    "unstable modes in the magnetic towers differ according to conditions within the flow .",
    "the adiabatic pfd jet is unstable to @xmath50 and  2 mode perturbations , and its core adopts a elliptical cross - section . on the other hand ,",
    "the pfd jet with a keplerian rotating base exhibits an @xmath51 kink mode instability .",
    "the beam is not completely destroyed but adopts a chaotic clumpy structure .",
    "base rotation causes a slow amplification of the toroidal field exacerbating a pressure unbalance in the jet s core that leads to instability .",
    "the cooling pfd jet also shows a @xmath51 kink mode instability .",
    "cooling reduces the thermal energy of the jet s core , making the thermal pressure insufficient to damp the magnetic pressure kink perturbations .",
    "the cooling pfd beam shows the fastest growth rate of the kink instability .    our magnetic tower ( pdf jets ) simulations are in good agreement with the laboratory experiments of @xcite .",
    "in both our simulations and the experiments : ( 1 ) jets carry axial currents which return along the contact discontinuities , ( 2 ) the jet cores have a high @xmath3 , ( 3 ) jet beams and cavities are pfd , ( 4 ) jets are eventually corrugated by current driven instabilities becoming a collimated chain of magnetized `` clumps '' or `` bullets '' .",
    "the similarity between our models and the experiments is particularly noteworthy because our implementation was not tuned to represent the laboratory results .",
    "this strengthens the case for the usefulness of laboratory experiments in articulating new features of astrophysical mhd flows in cases where similarity conditions can be obtained .",
    "we found that pfd jets decelerate by about 20% relative to the hd ones given the same injected energy flux .",
    "this is because pfd jets produce not only axial but radial expansion due to magnetic pressure .",
    "all of the pre - collimated energy flux of the hd case is more efficiently directed to axial mechanical power . also , the long term evolution of pfd jets yield a series of collimated clumps , the magnetization properties of which may vary over time .",
    "pfd flows may thus eventually evolve into hd jets at large distances from the central engine .",
    "our work shows that outflows launched as magnetic towers show a different behavior compared with those launched by magneto - centrifugal ( mcl ) mechanisms when the mcl flows become asymptotically kinetic energy flux dominated . as it was shown by hartigan et al .",
    "2007 , in yso flows some mechanism may be needed to reduce the magnetization of plasma close to the jet source .",
    "if these flows begin as magnetic towers then the disruption of the central jets via kink modes may provide a means to produce collimated high beta clumps of material as is observed in hh flows .",
    "thus our work may help to lead methods for distinguishing between different launch mechanisms by providing descriptions of asymptotic flow characteristics where observations might be possible .",
