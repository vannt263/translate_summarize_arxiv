    "ever since the discovery of quantum hall effect , the investigation of electronic transport in the low - dimensional systems has witnessed many important and fascinating results , both theoretical and experimental@xmath1 .",
    "the ever increasing interest in these systems is attributed partly to advancement in the modern semiconductor technology ( e.g. , molecular beam eptaxy and electronic beam lithography ) that makes it possible to fabricate the nanostructures with controllable chemical composition and geometric structures@xmath2 quantum - wells , -wires , -dots , -rings , -crossbars , -balls are a few to name .",
    "the keystone behind the intense research interest in such systems world - wide is esentially the fact that their dimension(s ) are ( or have to be ) comparable to the de broglie wavelength , so as to observe the quantum - size effects .",
    "many novel discoveries in physics have originated from the study of wave propagation in periodic structures .",
    "examples include x - ray and electron diffraction by crystals , electronic band structure , bloch oscillator , and holography .",
    "analogies between subfields of physics have also opened amazingly new fruitful avenues in research .",
    "an exciting example is the recent discovery@xmath3 of periodic dielectric structures that exhibit what is called `` photonic band gap '' , by analogy with the electronic band gap in semiconductor crystals .",
    "photons within the frequency range of the gaps are completely forbidden , so that atoms in such materials are denied to spontaneously absorb and re - emit light in this region ; this has obvious implications for highly efficient lasers .",
    "since the interesting phenomena emerging from photonic band gap structures , such as the inhibition / prohibition of spontaneous emission , the formation of localized states of light , and the photon - atom bound states , are all the consequences of the existence of the gap(s ) , a major part of research efforts has concentrated on the search for such photonic crystals . within almost a decade the field has prospered much more than eli yablonovitch and sajeev john could have imagined@xmath4 .",
    "it did not take long before photonic crystals aroused interest in the analogous studies in other systems as well ; we refer to the ones allowing , for example , elastic / acoustic waves@xmath5 , and spin waves@xmath6 .",
    "the composite sytems exhibiting complete or pseudogaps , within which the respective waves are forbidden , are useful both from the practical and fundamental point of view . from the practical point of view",
    ", such systems can be used to design the filters that prohibit the propagation of respective waves at certain frequencies while allowing free propagation at others . from the fundamental point of view",
    ", the propagation of such waves in a slightly disordered composite system can lead to the novel phenomenon concerned with the anderson localization .",
    "it is noteworthy that the authentic seeds of classical wave localization were disseminated in a classic paper by sajeev john in 1984@xmath7 . a systematic account of the theoretical and experimental work on electronic- , phononic- , photonic-",
    ", and vibrational - band gap crystals is given in an extensive review article by the author@xmath4 .",
    "in this work we are concerned with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic system of semiconducting ( dielectric ) cylinders embedded in a dielectric ( semiconductor ) background .",
    "in fact , it could be considered a bulk - mass of semiconductor with periodically punched infinitely long thin holes .",
    "the cross - sections of these cylinders ( or punched holes ) are considered to be much less than the de broglie wavelength , so as to neglect the quantum - size effects .",
    "we believe that such geometric structures should be easily realizable through the aforesaid nanostructure growth techniques .",
    "our principal interest is the prospect of achieving a complete plasmonic band gap ( pbg ) ; this is defined to be a stop band within which the plasmon propagation is prohibited irrespective of the direction of propagation and of the polarization of the plasma wave .",
    "the existence of pbg in such composites should have important consequences for designing filters for the plasma waves and for the fundamental physics interest associated with the anderson localization thereof .",
    "in fact , the possibility of experimental realization of the anderson localization of plasma waves in random and incommensurate layered systems was predicted almost a decade ago@xmath8 .",
    "it is noteworthy that our model theory is based on the full vectorial maxwell s equations .",
    "we also consider an applied magnetostatic filed oriented parallel to the axis of the cylinders ( which is taken to be the z - axis ) . in order to calculate the band structure of such a binary composite",
    ", we employ a plane - wave method and fourier - series - expansion of the position - dependent material parameters .",
    "it should thus be pointed out that we do not make use of any messy electromagnetic boundary conditions usually employed for inhomogeneous systems . the semiconductor medium in the inclusions and/or background",
    "is characterized by the frequency - dependent ( local ) dielectric function .",
    "the first hand effort of using local theory for photonic crystals has been made in the recent past@xmath9 .",
    "we neglect the damping effects and hence ignore the absorption . in the state - of - the - art high quality semiconductor systems",
    "available , this is thought to be quite a reasonable approximation .",
    "thus our purpose is to calculate the band structure of a neat and clean 2d periodic binary semiconductor - dielectric composites .",
    "a number of investigators have calculated such dispersion characteristics of 1d periodic systems ( superlattices , for example ) both with and without an applied magnetic field@xmath10 . however",
    ", no one , to our knowledge , has ever embarked on the possibility of observing complete band gaps in the systems considered .",
    "the authors were , most of the time , interested in reporting the physical conditions leading to the existence of the bulk bands and the surface plasmons or magnetoplasmons in the infinite and semi - infinite superlattice systems .",
    "this seems to be true irrespective of the systems ( compositional or doping ( n - i - p - i ) superlattices ) considered , methodology ( classical or quantal ) employed , and the orientation of the magnetic field ( voigt- , perpendicular- , or faraday - geometry ) pondered .",
    "the same remark is valid for the work on the 1d lateral ( quantum wire ) superlattices@xmath11 .",
    "the rest of the paper is designed as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the secular equations required to compute the plasmon band structures of the 2d binary semiconductor composites .",
    "the extensive numerical computational results are discussed in sec .",
    "this includes results both on square and hexagonal arrangements . a brief summary in sec .",
    "iv concludes our finding in this paper .",
    "we consider a 2d periodic system of semiconducting cylinders embedded in a different semiconducting background . for the sake of generality",
    ", we consider both cylindrical inclusions and the background materials to be semiconductors to be characterized by the frequency - dependent ( local ) dielectric functions . an external magnetostatic field ( @xmath12 )",
    "is assumed to be oriented along the axis ( @xmath13 ) of the cylinders .",
    "we are interested in the nonmagnetic materials , which implies that @xmath14 in the maxwell equations .",
    "in the situation at hand ( @xmath15),the dielectric tensor @xmath16 is simplified by the symmetry requirements such that : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we start with full vectorial maxwell s curl field equations . after eliminating the magnetic field variable @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the following wave field equation for the macroscopic electric field vector(@xmath21 ) :    @xmath22    where @xmath16 is a @xmath23 matrix and @xmath24 is the vacuum vector ; @xmath25 being the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath26 is the angular frequency of the wave .",
    "eq.(1 ) can be written in the matrix form as follows :    @xmath27 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } e_x\\\\ e_y\\\\ e_z \\end{array } \\right ] = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ] ]    here @xmath28 , etc .",

    "( 3 ) represents the propagation of the plasma waves which remain independent of the magnetic field ; whereas the set of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) refers to the magnetoplasma waves .",
    "we will therefore derive two independent secular equations corresponding to the two situations .",
    "it is , however , noteworthy that both equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are valid for arbitrary inhomogeneity .",
    "here we are concerned with the plasma waves governed by eq .",
    "we focus our attention on an inhomogeneous medium which exhibits spatial periodicity .",
    "that means that the position - dependent material parameters @xmath38 may be expanded in the fourier series .",
    "we write @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the reciprocal lattice vector that has the corresponding dimensionality .",
    "the z - component of the field vector must satisfy the bloch theorem : @xmath41 equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) must be substituted in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . a straightforward algebra , then multiplying the whole equation by @xmath42 , and integrating over the unit cell yields the following result : @xmath43 for binary composites every unit cell is composed of only two materials  inclusions ( i ) and background ( b ) characterized by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , we must specify the filling fraction @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , for materials @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we consider @xmath50 to be given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the area of the unit cell and the integration is over the unit cell .",

    "so the only way down to the determination of the eigenvalues is to treat eq .",

    "were limited in the range of @xmath100 ; which implies to 441 plane waves considered .",
    "this resulted in a reliably very good convergence ; at least up to the first fiftieth bands . in this paper",
    "we will confine ourselves to the waves which turn out to be independent of the applied magnetic field and hence are governed by eq .",
    "the analytical and numerical details of the magnetic - field dependent waves are deferred to a forthcoming publication .",
    "for the purpose of numerical computation , we specify the semiconductor- dielectric composite to be made up of doped gaas  intrinsic gaas or doped gaas  vacuum .",

    "this includes exchanging materials in the cylindrical inclusions and the background medium ; in addition to the two values of @xmath102 .",
    "the whole range of filling fraction is explored in order to discuss the regime of at least first ten bands of the respective composites in both square and hexagonal lattices ( see fig .",

    "the dos in the right part of the triptych has been calculated on the basis of the scanning in the middle part , which corresponds to 1326 @xmath73 points .",
    "the three parts of the triptych together demonstrate that there is , indeed , a genuine full gap in the frequency range defined by @xmath106 and we consider such calculations as essential .",
    "extensive computation of the bs for the same composite as considered in fig .",
    "2 reveals that one can also achieve some higher energy gaps within the first ten bands for certain values of the filling fraction .",
    "for instance , for @xmath107 , there are three full gaps within the first ten bands  the first one is analogous to the one shown in fig .",
    "2 , the second one exists between the third and fourth bands , and the third one opens between the ninth and tenth bands . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the third gap exists between the sixth and seventh bands , whereas the second gap , although differs in magnitude and frequency range , still persists between the third and fourth bands . for @xmath109 , there are only two gaps  the first one exists below the first band and the second one opens between the sixth and seventh .",
    "we find that , whether or not the higher energy gaps exist , the lowest gap below a threshold frequency @xmath110 ( which varies with @xmath46 ) defined as the minimum of the first band at the @xmath105 point , always persists .",
    "it has been noted that , for @xmath111 , only the lowest gap exists .",
    "this is true even for the close - packing value ( @xmath112 ) where the cylinders just touch each other .",
    "the dependence of the gap - widths of the lowest ( which is also the widest ) gap on the filling fraction for diversely designed composites in square lattice is summarized in fig .",
    "3 . the curves designated as asj , saj , isj , and sij refer , respectively , to the composites made up of cylindrical holes in doped gaas background , cylindrical doped gaas in vacuum , cylindrical intrinsic gaas in doped gaas background , and cylindrical doped gaas in intrinsic gaas background ; @xmath113 correspond to @xmath114 .",
    "the important points one can notice at glance are the following .",
    "the composites made up of doped semiconductor inclusions in the dielectric background give rise to the lowest gap ( below @xmath110 ) whose width increases with increasing filling fraction ( see , for example , the curves saj and sij ; @xmath115 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the composites made up of dielectric cylinders in the doped semiconductor background give rise to the lowest gap which decreases as the filling fraction increases ( see , for example , the curves asj and isj ) .",
    "comparing the curves asj with isj ( or saj with sij ) leads us to infer that the larger the dielectric mismatch ( between the inclusions and the background ) , the wider is the gap - width .",
    "similarly , comparing the respective curves for j=1 with those for j=2 reveals that the gap - width becomes larger as the plasma frequency increases .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the maximum gap - width ( of the lowest gap ) one can achieve is , empirically , defined by @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that the largest gap to midgap ratio ( gmr ) one can achieve is exactly two .",
    "this abides by the fact that in order to obtain gmr @xmath117 , @xmath118 should be @xmath119 @xmath120 ; @xmath118 ( @xmath121 ) being the frequency of the top ( bottom ) of the existing gap .",
    "figure 4 ilustrates the band structure and dos for a hexagonal lattice of doped gaas cylinders in vacuum for a filling fraction @xmath103 .",
    "the plots are rendered in terms of the dimensionless frerquency @xmath74 versus bloch vector @xmath73 .",
    "the left part of the triptych represents the bs in three principal symmetry directions , letting @xmath73 scan only the periphery of the irreducible part of the first brillouin zone ( see the inset on the right ) .",
    "the middle part is the result of an extensive scanning of @xmath104 in the irreducible triangle @xmath105jx of the brillouin zone  the interior of this zone and its surface , as well as the principal directions shown in the left part of this figure .",
    "the dos in the right part of the triptych has been calculated on the basis of the scanning in the middle part , which corresponds to 1275 @xmath73 points .",
    "the three parts of the triptych together demonstrate that there is a genuine full gap in the frequency range defined by @xmath122 .",
    "in addition , there is another band - gap opening up between the first and second bands  defined by the maximum ( minimum ) of the first ( second ) band at j ( x ) point .",
    "extensive computation of the bs for the same composite as represented by fig .",
    "4 reveals that there are some other higher energy gaps opening up within the first ten bands for certain values of @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath123 , there are three more full gaps , apart from the lowest one that opens below @xmath110  the first one exists between the first two bands , the second one opens between the third and fourth bands , and the third one exists between the eighth and ninth bands . for @xmath124 , we obtain two more full gaps , apart from the lowest one , with varying frequency range and magnitudes . at @xmath125 , we left with only two full gaps  the first one is the same that exists below the minimum ( at @xmath105 point ) of the lowest band and the second one opens between the third and fourth bands . for @xmath126 , there are no more full gaps except the lowest one .",
    "the semiconductor - dielectric composites in the hexagonal lattice , just as in the square lattice , are always seen to give rise to the lowest gap persisting below a threshold frequency @xmath110 .",
    "the dependence of the lowest gap - width on the filling fraction for diversely designed composites in the hexagonal lattice is depicted in fig .",
    "5 . comparing fig . 5 with fig .",
    "3 clearly reveals that the gap - widths ( of the lowest gap ) for the respective composites in the hexagonal lattice , over almost the whole common range of filling fractions , are larger than those in the square lattice .",
    "the rest of the discussion related to fig .",
    "3 is still seen to be valid .",
    "it should be pointed out that this trend of achieving larger gaps in the hexagonal lattice as compared to the square lattice is the same as has been noted earlier in the cases of photonic as well as phononic crystals@xmath4 .",
    "this seems to be physically quite a reasonable result , because the constant energy surfaces in the hexagonal lattice are closer to the circular shape than those of a square lattice .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the simple 2d periodic binary semiconductor- dielectric composites can give rise to full plasmonic band - gaps .",
    "although we consider an applied magnetic field oriented along the axis of the cylindrical inclusions , two independent polarizations of the waves have been obtained  @xmath127 axis and @xmath128 axis , just as in the absence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "only the waves in the latter polarization are magnetic - field dependent .",
    "the numerical results presented in this work correspond to the former polarization . as such the term `` full '' should be reserved with respect to this polarization . in principle , the band structures computed separately for the two polarizations should be superimposed  one over the other  to check and claim whether or not the band - gaps are independent of the polarization .",
    "this is the task aimed at in a future publication .",
    "our theoretical results on achieving full band - gaps must be accompanied by a word of warning . apart from the fact that both polarizations need to be considered",
    ", we have here also assumed the z - component of the wave vector ( @xmath35 ) to be zero .",
    "considering @xmath35 finite would give a better insight into the problem .",
    "we have also ignored the damping effects and the interaction of the charge carriers with the optical phonons .",
    "the latter could be taken into account by considering the frequency - dependence of the background dielectric constants .",
    "additional work addressing the effect stemming from the cylinders of different cross - sections and orientation of the external magnetic field would be worthwhile . considering the cylindrical inclusions of finite lengths",
    "should be of more practical interest .",
    "attractive possibilities exist for the experimental observation of such plasmonic band - gaps , both with and without an applied magnetic field , in the semiconductor- dielectric composites as investigated here .",
