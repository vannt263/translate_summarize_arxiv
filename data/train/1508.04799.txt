    "originally discovered by @xcite and @xcite , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) was suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bh91 hereafter ) to be the physical mechanism driving the redistribution of angular momentum required for the accretion process in keplerian discs orbiting compact objects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "keplerian discs have a positive radial gradient in angular momentum , and therefore are linearly ( rayleigh-)stable .",
    "purely hydrodynamic perturbations are unlikely to grow to amplitudes at which the associated stresses can account for efficient angular - momentum transport . in the presence of a weak magnetic field , however , a negative radial gradient in the angular velocity of the disc is mri - unstable , and seed perturbations can grow exponentially on time scales close to the rotational period . during this phase ,",
    "_ channel modes _ develop .",
    "channel modes are pairs of coherent radial up- and downflows stacked vertically and threaded by layers of magnetic field of alternating radial and azimuthal polarity . in these modes , the magnetic tension ( maxwell stress tensor )",
    "transports angular momentum along the field lines from the inner parts of the disc outwards .",
    "the criterion for the mri onset can be formulated in a rather simple manner , even if the thermal stratification ( gradients of entropy or molecular weight ) and non - ideal effects ( viscosity , resistivity ) are included @xcite .",
    "this allows for its application beyond keplerian discs , in particular to proto - neutron stars ( pnss ) resulting from the core - collapse of rotating massive stars .",
    "simplified simulations by @xcite showed that such pnss possess regions in which the mri can grow on shorter time - scales than the time between the bounce and the successful explosion .",
    "this finding , later confirmed in multi - dimensional models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presents the possibility of generating strong magnetic fields that can tap the rotational energy of the core , power magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite , and become a potentially important ingredient in rapidly - rotating core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "how much these systems are affected by the mri crucially depends on both its growth rate and on the final amplitude of the seed perturbations .",
    "we can give an upper limit by assuming that the mri ceases to grow once the magnetic field comes close ( within a factor of @xmath3 ) to equipartition with the energy of the differential rotation .",
    "in ccsne , this would correspond to dynamically important field strengths up to @xmath4 .",
    "similar energetic arguments can be used to express the mri - generated stresses in the framework of @xmath5disc models @xcite .",
    "this estimate neglects possible effects quenching the mri before it reaches its maximally - allowed energy , and the effects of buoyancy as shown by @xcite , who performed mri simulations in the presence of buoyancy .",
    "they showed that the termination amplitude ( at the end of the exponential growth ) is not necessarily correlated to the magnetic field strength in the turbulent state that followed .",
    "the physics of the termination of the mri growth remains an active field of research with many studies devoted to finding the value of the @xmath3 parameter for the stress tensor .",
    "we refer , among others , to the works of @xcite .",
    "the model of parasitic instabilities by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gx94 hereafter ) , further studied and developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provides a clear physical picture of the termination mechanism .",
    "the mri channel modes are characterized by a shear layer and a current sheet in the vertical profiles of velocity and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "hence , the ( laminar ) channel flows can be unstable against _ secondary _ ( or _ parasitic _ ) _ instabilities _ of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) or tearing - mode ( tm ) type .",
    "initially , the role of the parasites is negligible , as they grow much more slowly than the mri .",
    "however , since the growth rate of the secondary instabilities is proportional to the channel mode amplitude , it is clear that at some stage the parasites will grow faster than the mri channels whose growth rate is constant , whereas the parasites grow exponentially with time .",
    "roughly at this point , the parasitic instabilities should disrupt the channel modes and terminate the mri growth , marking the transition to the turbulent saturation phase @xcite .",
    "a further discussion of the mri saturated state is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "@xcite analytically studied the mri termination in resistive - viscous mhd by solving simplified model equations for the evolution of the parasitic instabilities .",
    "he identified different parameter - space regimes where , depending on hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers , either the kh instability or the tm is the dominant ( i.e.  faster developing ) secondary instability .",
    "@xcite found that the magnetic field at the surface of the pns can be enhanced w.r.t .  the interior regions . if this is also the case for rotating cores , mhd phenomena ( like , e.g.  the mri ) should be most prominent at the pns surface . in this region ,",
    "the reynolds numbers are large if the surface is located above the neutrinosphere , which however may not always be the case ( see fig.10 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we only investigate the regime of very high reynolds numbers in which , according to the parasitic model , the mri should be terminated by the kh instability .",
    "the parasitic model has not been tested with direct global numerical simulations of the mri in ccsne .",
    "@xcite found in their semi - global 2d ideal mhd simulations that , because of numerical resistivity , the mri was terminated by tms . in their 3d simulations the mri was terminated by non - axisymmetric parasitic instabilities , although a clear identification of their nature was not possible .    to test the predictions of @xcite",
    ", we performed a set of 2d and 3d resistive - viscous mhd simulations of the mri .",
    "given initial conditions , we studied in particular the importance of non - ideal effects by varying the values of both the uniform viscosity and uniform resistivity , which influence the growth of kh modes and of tms , respectively . in the case of the kh instability , which is present already in ideal hydrodynamics , viscosity and resistivity",
    "alter the properties of the unstable modes merely quantitatively .",
    "on the other hand , tm are essentially driven by resistivity , i.e.  they do not grow in ideal mhd , while viscosity plays a minor role by changing the properties of the unstable modes only quantitatively .",
    "since we are mainly concerned in this work with identifying the type of the parasitic instability that limits the growth of the mri in particular models , we performed all our simulations ( except for one control model ) with a non - zero resistivity , but simulated models with both zero and non - zero viscosity .",
    "we defer a more thorough quantitative analysis of the influence of non - ideal effects to a subsequent work .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : mri_theory ] we give the criterion for the onset of the mri , and we describe the initial stage of the instability during which channel modes develop .",

    "the smaller the reynolds numbers , the larger the growth rate reduction and the larger the shifts .",
    "moreover , the magnetic reynolds number has a bigger influence than the hydrodynamic one , because the nature of the mri is more `` magnetic '' than `` hydrodynamic '' .",
    "for any reynolds number , the mri growth rate @xmath86 tends to zero for sufficiently short wavevectors , i.e.  @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( see eq.[eq : gr_ideal ] ) .",
    "pc08 found analytic expressions for the growth rate @xmath69 , and the wavevector @xmath70 of the fastest - growing mode only in some limiting cases , usually for very large or very small reynolds numbers ( e.g.  for @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath91 ( which holds for core collapse supernovae outside the neutrinosphere ) the ideal mhd expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammamri ] ) and ( [ eq : kmri ] ) determine the values of the wavenumber and the growth rate of the fastest - growing mode with relative errors @xmath92 compared to the values obtained by the expressions of pc08 .",
    "the high conductivity of the degenerate matter in a supernova core implies very high magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "using an order - of - magnitude estimate of @xmath93 @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rm ] ) yields @xmath94 because the magnetic reynolds number is so large , we can safely neglect resistivity in the expressions for the growth rate and the wavelength of the mri .",
    "the molecular viscosity of supernova matter ( @xmath95@xmath96s@xmath97 ) is only a few orders of magnitude larger than the resistivity , i.e.  the respective hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath98 @xcite . in the region below the neutrinosphere",
    ", however , the tight coupling between neutrinos and matter changes the situation . according to @xcite the neutrino - matter interaction results in an effective viscosity that varies between a few @xmath99 deep inside the pns and @xmath100 near the neutrinosphere",
    ", i.e.  one finds @xmath101 the above equation implies that the expressions for the growth rate and for the angles @xmath57 and @xmath78 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : v_b_pi1]-[eq : gammamri ] ) , which are valid in the limit of ideal mhd , are not satisfied inside the pns . outside the neutrinosphere , the interaction between matter and neutrinos changes its character from diffusion to free streaming . in the free streaming regime neutrino drag",
    "damps fluctuations not like an effective viscosity , but like a drag force that is independent of the wavelength .",
    "its impact on the mri is therefore very different from the impact of a viscosity @xcite .",
    "neutrino drag is relevant not only outside but also significantly below the neutrinosphere as long as the dynamics of interest is happening at a wavelength shorter than the neutrino mean free path , which varies from a metre inside the pns to several kilometre near its surface ( see fig.5 in * ? ? ?",
    "because of these complications we will not investigate this effect here and refer the reader to the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mri channels can not grow indefinitely , because their energy would constantly increase , whereas the energy of the system contained in differential rotation , which provides the reservoir for the mri , is finite . hence , there must be a physical mechanism terminating mri growth .",
    "gx94 suggested that mri channels being exact solutions of the mhd equations ( in the shearing sheet and incompressible flow approximations ) may be unstable against parasitic instabilities , which could terminate the mri growth .",
    "they found in their analytic calculations ( under the assumptions described in sec .",
    "[ sec : termi_para ] ) that in ideal mhd ( shear driven ) kh modes can develop on top of mri channels .",
    "gx94 also suggested that in resistive mhd , parasitic instabilities of the ( current driven ) tm type could develop , too .",
    "we note that the importance of magnetic reconnection for mri termination was already discussed by bh91 .",
    "analytic calculations by @xcite in resistive mhd confirmed this hypothesis . alternatively ,",
    "if this scenario does not hold , the magnetic field of the mri channels could grow to a dynamically relevant strength ( when the alfvn speed becomes comparable to the sound speed ) , violating the approximation of incompressibility .",
    "consequently , the magnetic field pressure would become important and it could push matter towards magnetic null surfaces of the mri channels , or mri channels could become buoyancy unstable ( gx94 ) . finally , small amplitude mri channels emerging in an already ( mri - driven ) turbulent state could be destroyed by non - linear mode - mode interactions or turbulent mixing @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider the first scenario , i.e.  mri termination via parasitic instabilities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : termi_para ] , we will briefly discuss assumptions and findings of the parasite model of @xcite and of its extension to resistive - viscous mhd by @xcite .",
    "gx94 considered perturbations in a system with already well developed mri channels ( of the fastest - growing mode with @xmath70 ) given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the velocity and the magnetic field of the parasitic instabilities , respectively .    solving the equations governing",
    "the evolution of the secondary ( parasitic ) instabilities is a very challenging task , because mri channels , which are treated as a background field for the perturbations , are non - stationary .",
    "hence , standard techniques like an wkb ansatz can not be used . to make this task more tractable for analytic studies ,",
    "gx94 considered a stage of mri growth when the amplitude of the mri channels is much larger than the initial weak magnetic field , i.e.  @xmath105 .",
    "the growth rate of the secondary instabilities @xmath106 ( which scales @xmath107 ) is then much larger than the mri growth rate , i.e.  @xmath108 . under these conditions",
    "the time evolution of the mri channels , the coriolis force ( which is of the order of @xmath69 ) , the background shear flow , and the initial background magnetic field @xmath109 can be neglected .",
    "hence , instead of searching for solutions to perturbations according to eqs.([channel_full_p1 ] ) and ( [ channel_full_p2 ] ) , gx94 considered a more simplified system where the velocity and the magnetic field are given by @xmath110 with @xmath111 being the time at which the secondary perturbations are imposed .",
    "similar assumptions were also made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified regions in parameter space , where depending on the values of the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers either kh or tm is the dominant ( i.e.  faster developing ) secondary instability that terminates mri growth . in particular , for the conditions prevailing in core collapse supernovae outside the pns ( @xmath112 ) the exponential growth phase of the mri should be terminated by kh instabilities .",

    "we add terms including viscosity and resistivity to the flux terms in the euler equations and to the electric field in the mhd induction equation .",
    "we treat these terms similarly to the fluxes and electric fields of ideal mhd , except for using an arithmetic average instead of an approximate riemann solver to compute the interface fluxes .",
    "the explicit time integration can be done with runge - kutta schemes of first , second , third , and fourth order ( rk1 , rk2 , rk3 , and rk4 ) , respectively .",
    "choosing appropriate numerical schemes for our 3d simulations is an important issue , because we want to keep the numerical viscosity and resistivity as low as possible without unnecessarily increasing the computational cost .",
    "therefore , before applying the code to the mri , we assessed its numerical viscosity and resistivity in an extended set of auxiliary simulations ( rembiasz et al .",

    "however , @xcite have recently shown that the viscosity due to neutrinos can be much higher in collapsing cores than previously thought .",
    "close to the neutrinosphere , i.e.  whenever the neutrino mean free path is shorter than the length scale of interest , very low reynolds numbers are expected . the most favuorable place for mri amplification",
    "is located close to the pns star surface , where differential rotation is stronger , and the reynolds numbers are larger if the surface is located above the neutrinosphere , which however may not always be the case ( see fig.10 in * ? ? ?",
    "however this recent finding does not invalidate our studies as our models can be easily scaled for different initial conditions .",
    "we may choose different values of the radius , @xmath22 , rotational velocity , @xmath25 , or density , @xmath9 , and scale the key physical quantities in following way : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , @xmath132 is the box length in the direction @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 ) , and the barred quantities are the values set up in or computed from our simulations .",
    "we stress again that the most favorable place for the development of the mri is the region close to the surface of the pns , where the differential rotation gradient and the reynolds numbers are larger than deep inside the pns . since the choice of @xmath36 is ad hoc , it is evident that the ratio @xmath135 can be made as close as desired to one .",
    "this means that neither the mri growth rate nor the typical growth time will change under a translation of the box to the surface of the pns .",
    "such a translation will also imply that @xmath136 , while @xmath137 , hence , the typical magnetic fields and maxwell stresses would be 0.6 and 0.4 times smaller than in our models .",

    "in accordance with theoretical predictions of @xcite for flows with @xmath112 , we found that in model#7 parasitic instabilities develop at an angle @xmath273 ( see fig.[fig : parasitic_theta ] , and middle panel of fig.[fig : deep_cuts ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that it is unnecessary to use a box elongated in azimuthal direction ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "instead , one could rather study the mri in a box with a horizontal aspect ratio @xmath328 to minimize the volume of the computational domain without affecting the development of parasitic instabilities . to test this hypothesis , we simulated model#8 in a box of size @xmath329 using the same spatial resolution as for reference model#7 .",
    "in both simulations , the maxwell stress tensor at mri termination attained the same value , which confirms our expectations .",
    "we can further reduce the computational domain in the vertical direction based on the following observation . in simulations performed with the default box , we chose the magnetic field strength in such a way that three of the fastest - growing mri modes fit in the computational domain .",
    "thus , it should be possible to reduce the vertical extent of the box by a factor of @xmath330 , i.e.  @xmath331 , without hindering the growth of the dominant mri mode .",
    "however , in such a smaller domain parasitic instabilities are restricted to modes having a vertical wavelength equal to the width of an mri channel ( called type - i modes by gx94 ) , and modes with a longer vertical wavelength ( type - ii ) are suppressed .",
    "nonetheless , according to the predictions of gx94 and @xcite , in the ideal mhd limit or for @xmath332 , the dominant parasitic modes should be ( kh modes ) of type - i .",
    "hence , we expect the mri termination process to be unaltered by a box of smaller vertical size .    to test this theoretical prediction , we simulated model#9 in a box of size @xmath333 using the same grid resolution as in models#7 and # 8 .",
    "we found that the maxwell stress tensor reached the same value at mri termination in all three models .",
    "this result not only confirms ( given our initial conditions ) the termination of the mri by `` type - i '' parasitic modes , which is an important result , but it also justifies the use of a computational box with a @xmath334 times smaller volume for studying the mri termination process .",
    "we made use of this fact in our resolution studies ( see next subsection ) .    in section [ ssec:2d ]",
    ", we showed that the mri is terminated by tms in axisymmetric 2d simulations .",
    "one can also impose axisymmetry in 3d simulations by choosing a box of vanishing azimuthal length , i.e.  @xmath335 .",
    "therefore , we expect that for a certain small , but non - zero @xmath326 , kh instabilities should be suppressed even in 3d simulations , and the mri should be terminated by tm instead . to determine this critical azimuthal box length , we performed a series of simulations varying @xmath326 from 1.0 to 0.1 km ( models # 12 to # 18 ) . moreover , to investigate the influence of viscosity , we ran these simulations with a non - zero shear viscosity corresponding to a hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath336",
    ". the shear viscosity should change the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode , but only by a negligible amount from the numerical point of view ( i.e.  less than @xmath337 ) .",
    "as expected , the mri is terminated by kh instabilities in model#12 , which only differs from model#9 by the value of @xmath338 . in both simulations , the parasitic instabilities have the same horizontal wavelength , @xmath272 , and they develop at the same angle @xmath247 within the measurement error . in models#13#16 , the mri is also terminated by kh instabilities , but the value of the maxwell stress tensor at termination is somewhat larger .",
    "this result can be easily understood : parasitic modes that would grow fastest in a box with @xmath339 are affected ( or even suppressed ) in narrower boxes , i.e.  the mri can operate a bit longer before it is finally terminated .",
    "the smaller the box , the stronger the suppression of the kh modes and the larger the deviation of such quantities as the maxwell stress at termination from model # 12 .",
    "finally , in models#17 ( @xmath340 ) and # 18 ( @xmath341 ) , kh modes are suppressed and the mri is terminated by tms , showing similar features as in the 2d simulations described in section  [ ssec:2d ] .",
    "we note that the maxwell stress reaches considerably higher values at termination in these models , because tm are growing more slowly .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed by @xcite in their mean - field shearing - box simulations of accretion discs . in simulations done in a box of size @xmath342 ,",
    "kh modes were suppressed and the mri channels were disrupted by tm , whereas in simulations done in larger boxes in the horizontal directions ( i.e.   @xmath343 and @xmath344 , or @xmath345 and @xmath346 ) , the mri was terminated by kh instabilities .    to summarize , mri termination in models#12#18 is well explained within the parasite model , and the minimum azimuthal box length for which kh modes are not severely affected by boundary conditions is @xmath347 .      to properly resolve mri termination , one needs to use a resolution that is high enough not only to resolve the mri channels , but also parasitic instabilities .",
    "the latter criterion is more stringent , as parasitic instabilities develop finer structures in vertical direction than mri channels do ( gx94 , * ? ? ?",
    "we explore this issue in a series of simulations performed in the small ( @xmath348 ; models # 2 , # 3 , # 4 , # 9 , and # 11 ) and in the default ( @xmath253 ; models # 5 , # 6 , # 7 , and # 10 ) computational box .",
    "as we have demonstrated in the previous subsection , parasitic instabilities can develop equally well in both computational domains , i.e.  the boxes are equally well suited for resolution studies .    in models # 2#4 , which were simulated with 816 zones per mri channel in the vertical direction , we observe differences already during the phase of exponential growth .",
    "first , channel modes emerge @xmath349 later than in the other better resolved simulations .",
    "secondly , the channel modes somewhat differ from the analytic solution , i.e.  some imperfections develop on channels which are of numerical and not physical origin .",
    "thirdly , the mri growth rate measured with the help of @xmath303 slightly fluctuates during the phase of exponential growth .",
    "these fluctuations of the order of a few percent can be explained by the fact that the above mentioned imperfections also contribute to @xmath303 .    in models # 5#11 , which were simulated with at least 20 zones per mri channel , the channel modes appear roughly at the same time and grow at the same constant rate during the phase of exponential growth .",
    "based on these observations , we conclude that 20 zones per mri channel are sufficient to resolve the phase of exponential growth with the mp9 scheme ( but more zones will be required for lower order reconstruction schemes ) .",
    "this result is consistent with previous estimations of the numerical viscosity and resistivity of the code done by @xcite . with the help of tests involving alfn wave propagation and tm instabilities ,",
    "he determined scaling laws for the numerical viscosity and resistivity of the code as a function of resolution and initial conditions . given our numerical setup , the numerical viscosity and resistivity of the code are @xmath350 , if the relevant length scale is covered by at least 20 zones ( see also section4.2.5.1 ) .    to investigate the nature of the parasitic instabilities that are responsible for quenching the mri , we used both fourier analysis and the local magnetic field structure during mri termination . in models#2 to # 11 , we find parasitic instabilities of kh type developing at an angle consistent with @xmath351 independent of resolution .",
    "the horizontal wavelength of the parasitic modes ranges from @xmath352 in the coarsest resolved model#2 to @xmath353 in the best resolved models#10 and # 11 .",
    "remarkably kh instabilities develop even in model#2 , although it was simulated with the coarsest grid which noticeably affects the structure of the channel modes .",
    "their identification was not straightforward , however . from the patterns recognizable in the magnetic field structure during mri termination",
    ", one can exclude tm and other obvious numerical artefacts , e.g. , arising from imperfect boundary conditions .",
    "we also find patterns resembling underresolved vortex rolls which we attribute to kh modes , although without the help of fourier analysis , our experience gained from observing similar patterns in better resolved simulations , and most importantly a theoretical model ( gx94 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this identification would have been impossible .",
    "the value of the maxwell stress at mri termination depends on the grid resolution ( see tab.[tab : main_results ] and green circle symbols in fig.[fig : reso ] ) . it is larger for coarse grids , the only exception being model#2 . using the mp9 reconstruction scheme , the maxwell stress converges to a value of @xmath354 in models # 10 and # 11 simulated with 67 and 134 grid cells per mri channel , respectively .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[fig : reso ] shows that @xmath303 follows roughly a power law with index @xmath355 as a function of the number of zones per mri channel , except for the under - resolved model#2 with only eight zones per channel , in which mri growth terminates at a much smaller value of @xmath303 .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath303 can be explained within the parasite model .",
    "the kh modes responsible for mri termination grow from the shear layers created by the mri channels . during their growth ,",
    "these secondary instabilities develop structures that are even smaller than the mri channels .",
    "therefore , to resolve these structures a finer grid is necessary than for the mri channels themselves . as a result",
    ", simulations may not be converged even if the numerically obtained mri growth rate is close to the theoretical value .",
    "because badly resolved kh modes grow at a rate below the theoretical expectation , parasitic instabilities reach the necessary amplitude to disrupt the channels slightly later during the evolution , and the mri will terminate at a somewhat higher amplitude than in well - resolved simulations .    the appearance of the outlier ( model#2 ) in fig.[fig : reso ] is not surprising .",
    "we have already seen that mri channels are underresolved in this model .",
    "therefore , one would not expect to find any reasonable termination amplitude for this model , i.e.  it is probably a chance coincidence that this model gives roughly the same results as the other better resolved models .    for completeness",
    ", we included also models#12#18 in fig.[fig : reso ] ( red diamond symbols ) , for which the parasitic modes are restricted not only by the grid resolution but also by the box size and some physical viscosity .",
    "the data of these models lie all above the dashed line indicating the influence of resolution alone .",
    "finally , the asterisk symbol marks the result of the ideal mhd model#1 , which we discuss in the next subsection .    .",

    "even though no physical viscosity was used for model # 9 , it is affected by a non - zero numerical viscosity . to infer the quantitative importance of the numerical viscosity",
    ", we first compare models which differ only in grid resolution in the inviscid limit , e.g. , model # 9 , where the evolution is still notably affected by numerical viscosity , and models # 10 and # 11 , which are already converged , as we have argued in the previous section .",
    "we note that the numerical viscosity accounts for the @xmath358 difference in the volume - averaged maxwell stress at termination ( i.e.  the parasitic instabilities are somewhat under - resolved ) , and has a negligible impact on the mri growth rate .",
    "we now turn to the comparison of an inviscid model ( # 9 ) with one where a physical viscosity has been included ( # 12 ) . quantifying the exact contribution of the numerical viscosity in a model that includes also physical viscosity",
    "is much more involved .",
    "the reasons for this difficulty are multiple . on the one hand ,",
    "the numerical viscosity is a scale dependent effect , affecting more the smallest scales .",
    "hence , it is relatively more important for the development of parasitic modes than for the mri growth . on the other hand ,",
    "the volume - averaged maxwell stress at termination depends chiefly on a delicate balance between two competing factors .",
    "first , models computed with a finite physical viscosity have a smaller @xmath207 .",
    "thus , for a similar growth time , @xmath359 should be smaller than for models computed without a physical viscosity .",
    "secondly , this effect is offset , however , by the also smaller growth rate of the kh parasitic modes , which defers the saturation process and allows for a further growth of @xmath359 . thereby",
    ", our comparison is of qualitative nature only . in view of the former reasoning",
    ", we tentatively attribute the @xmath360 difference in @xmath361 between the inviscid model # 9 and the viscous model # 12 to the effect of a finite viscosity in the latter one , though we can not unambiguously say which part of this difference is caused by numerical viscosity . to support the argument that a finite physical viscosity and not a numerical viscosity is driving the dynamics , we note that the mri growth rate decreases significantly in model # 12 ( as also in all other viscous models from # 13 to # 18 ) .",
    "this expected behaviour ( see section [ ssec : intability_criterion ] ) implies that including a physical viscosity causes measurable differences already in the mri growth phase .",

    "we performed the ideal mhd simulation of model#1 in the default size box , the results being very similar to those obtained for model#7 , which we simulated with the identical setup , but with @xmath154 .",
    "as expected , the mri grew in the ideal mhd simulations at a somewhat higher rate ( @xmath363 ) , because its growth was not damped by resistivity .",
    "we found that the mri is terminated by parasitic kh instabilities in this model , too .",
    "the parasites develop at an angle @xmath273 in accordance with the parasite model of gx94 .",
    "the maxwell stress at mri termination is @xmath364 , a value which is similar to those obtained for models#7 and # 12 ( the latter one being simulated with @xmath365 ) . from these findings",
    "we conclude that for reynolds numbers @xmath366 viscosity and resistivity have no strong influence on the process of mri termination and the saturation value of the maxwell stress .",
    "however , one should not forget that in all three simulations ( i.e.  models#1 , # 19 , and # 20 ) , numerical resistivity and numerical viscosity do contribute to the total hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers ( by lowering them ) .    in the limit of very high resistivity ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath367 , the mri modes that grow fastest in ideal mhd are completely suppressed by magnetic dissipation ( pc08 ) . only modes with sufficiently long wavelengths survive the interplay between mri amplification and resistive damping in this limiting case , because magnetic dissipation is weaker for these modes .",
    "the wavelength of the fastest - growing mode is @xmath368 ( pc08 ) . to keep @xmath369 in models#19 ( @xmath370 ) and # 20 ( @xmath371 )",
    ", we had to reduce the initial magnetic field strength to values of @xmath372 and @xmath373 , respectively .",
    "we find that the fastest mri mode grows at a considerably slower rate than in the ideal mhd limit in both models , the measured growth rates being @xmath374 ( model#19 ) and @xmath375 ( model#20 ) .",
    "these values agree very well with those of pc08 , who predicted @xmath376 and @xmath377 , respectively .",
    "pc08 also predicted that for @xmath378 and @xmath370 , we should find @xmath379 and @xmath380 , i.e.  the velocity channels and the magnetic field channels should almost be aligned with the @xmath22 axis and the @xmath30 axis , respectively .",
    "indeed , our simulations show that @xmath381 , i.e.  @xmath382 , during the exponential growth phase ( see fig.[fig : parasites_tm_time ] ) . finally ,",
    "according to @xcite , the mri should be terminated by tm and not kh instabilities for @xmath362 . for @xmath370 , the dominant parasitic mode should have a wavelength @xmath383 developing at an angle @xmath384 .",
    "a fourier analysis of the mri modes and their parasites ( see fig.[fig : parasites_tm_time ] ) shows that shortly before mri termination ( @xmath385 ) the energy stored in horizontal fourier modes increases significantly growing super - exponentially with time .",
    "however , because of numerical noise introduced by our imperfect boundary conditions , we could neither identify parasitic instabilities nor determine their angle with the help of the fourier analysis .",
    "therefore , the type of the parasitic instability terminating the mri in model#19 ( as well as in model#20 ) remains unknown .",
    "it is probably neither kh nor tm , because we could not recognise the characteristic features of none of these parasites .",
    "the bottom line is that based on models#19 and # 20 , we can not confirm the predictions of @xcite that for @xmath362 the mri is terminated by tm . as the highly resistive limit is of no direct relevance for core collapse supernovae , we did not investigate this regime in more detail .",

    "the presence of a dynamically relevant magnetic field is of great interest because it may have implications for the supernova explosion mechanism and for explaining the origin of neutron stars magnetic fields .",
    "however , for the typical magnetic field strength present in supernova progenitors , it is necessary to resolve numerically mri channels with a length scale @xmath386 m , which makes global simulations unfeasible even with present day supercomputers . to overcome the limitation of global simulations",
    "@xcite performed semi - global simulations in a kilometre size box located near the surface of the proto - neutron star .",
    "they confirmed the hypothesis of @xcite showing that the mri can strongly amplify the magnetic field and parasitic instabilities are able to destroy the mri channels , thereby quenching the amplification of the magnetic field .",

    "hence , @xcite could not give an upper limit on the mri - driven magnetic field amplification .",
    "this work tries to shed some light on the termination process .",
    "we numerically studied the evolution of the mri in the context of a ccsn .",
    "to this end , we performed a set of local 3d resistive - viscous mhd simulations in a box representing typical conditions in a proto - neutron star . in all of our simulations we observed the growth of the mri and its subsequent termination .",
    "we identified that secondary kh instabilities are responsible for mri termination by acting as parasites on the mri channels .",
    "our results are consistent with the predictions of the parasite model proposed by gx94 and further developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hence , the parasite model , which is based on a local stability analysis of the system , allows some insight into the termination process and provides a valuable guidance for interpreting numerical results .",
    "this conclusion was obtained by an analysis of our numerical simulations based on mri theory and the parasite model in a number of tests :    1 .",
    "we observe an exponential growth of mri channels of a size compatible with the predicted value , @xmath184 , for the fastest - growing mode ( bh91 ) .",
    "the growth rates measured in the numerical simulations agree with those obtained from the local analysis within the simulation box .",
    "the presence of viscosity or resistivity lowers the values of the growth rates as expected from theory . in the limit of large hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers , @xmath112 , the angle between velocity ( magnetic field ) in the mri channels and",

    "2 .   for simulations with large hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers , @xmath112 , the mri is terminated by kh instabilities , as predicted by gx94 and @xcite for this regime . to identify the kh instabilities we had to reduce the time interval between outputs of our simulations around termination to a value below the typical growth time of the parasites , in our case @xmath389 .",
    "this explains why @xcite did not observe the development of kh instabilities , since they employed insufficiently frequent output . to help the analysis we project the magnetic field components into the directions @xmath78 and @xmath57 . shortly before termination",

    "we identify the vortices as a consequence of kh instabilities , which eventually disrupt the channels causing turbulence .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the predictions of gx94 and @xcite .",

    "@xcite predicts that the mri should be terminated by tms . to this end",
    "we performed two simulations with @xmath370 and @xmath391 , but we were unable to identify the agent terminating the mri growth , because no clear signature of tm or kh instability could be identified in our simulations .",
    "we conclude that possibly even higher resistivities are required for tm to become the dominant secondary instability .",
    "a possible explanation of this discrepancy between theory and our simulations is the fact that the calculations of @xcite are based on somewhat simplified assumptions .",
    "therefore , his results should be treated more like a guideline rather than exact predictions .    to confirm the above conclusions , we have studied systematically the effect of resistivity , viscosity , box size , and grid resolution .",
    "there are a number of numerical artefacts that can affect the simulations :    1 .   in axisymmetric ( 2d ) simulations , the mri growth is terminated by tm .",
    "this was already reported by @xcite , who observed tm in their 2d ideal mhd simulations , in accordance with theoretical results obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that this resistive mhd instability must have been triggered by numerical resistivity . in 2d simulations only axisymmetric parasitic modes can develop .",
    "as axisymmetric kh modes are strongly suppressed by the magnetic field tension of the mri channels , tm become the dominant secondary instability .",
    "they suffer less strongly from this constraint , develop faster than axisymmetric kh modes ( but slower than kh modes would grow in full 3d ) , and terminate the mri growth . as a result the mri in 2d is terminated at unrealistically large magnetic stresses and continues to grow after termination , a behaviour not observed in our 3d simulations .",
    "we performed a set of simulations to study the dependence of the properties of the parasite modes . using a 9th - order spatial reconstruction scheme ( mp9 )",
    ", we reached convergent results only in simulations with at least 60 zones per mri channel , i.e.  the value of the magnetic stress at termination differed by less than @xmath392 between the two highest resolution runs .",
    "this grid resolution is significantly higher than the one necessary to obtain convergence in the growth rate of the mri , for which 8 zones are sufficient to obtain a @xmath392 accuracy .",
    "we note that the required number of zones will be significantly higher , if lower order reconstruction methods are used .",
    "our result is not surprising when viewed in the light of the parasite model .",
    "the kh instability is triggered by the shear layer between mri channels . at this",
    "layer structures develop that are much finer than the width of the channel itself . failing to capture the kh instabilities properly because of a lack of resolution leads to artificially large magnetic stresses at mri termination .",
    "however , the qualitative behaviour of the flow seems not to be affected by a lack of resolution . even for our lowest resolution simulation ( 8 zones per channel )",
    "we are able to identify kh instabilities developing at @xmath273 as the main termination agent .",
    "we studied how the box size can affect the development of parasitic instabilities . in 3d simulations with an azimuthal box length of at least @xmath393 the mri is terminated by kh modes , whereas simulations with an azimuthal box length @xmath394 gave very similar results as 2d simulations and the mri",
    "was terminated by tm ( because kh modes are suppressed ; compare models # 16 and # 17 in tab.[tab : main_results ] ) .",
    "taking into account that the parasitic kh instabilities develop at a @xmath395 angle , one should use a box size of at least @xmath396 is in the radial direction . however , we recommend using larger boxes in the horizontal directions to reduce the influence of the boundary conditions on the development of the parasitic instabilities . in the vertical direction",
    "it is sufficient to use a box size of @xmath184 , i.e.   it is sufficient to consider the evolution of one single mri channel to capture the termination process correctly . determining",
    "the minimum box size has been critical to be able to perform the simulations with the highest resolution presented in this work ( model # 11 with 134 zones per channel ) .",
    "our results have some important implications for the community modelling magnetorotational collapse of stellar cores . studying the termination of the exponential growth phase of the mri",
    ", we learned that it involves parasitic kh instabilities , but does neither depend on the physical resistivity nor viscosity present in ccsne .",
    "the effects of the interaction of neutrinos and matter , which at different locations in the pns can be described either as an effective viscosity or by a drag term , affect the properties of the mri , in particular its growth rate and wavelength @xcite .",
    "consequently , this interaction should induce modifications of the termination amplitude . on the other hand",
    ", we do not expect these effects to change the most important qualitative result of our study , namely that the mri is not terminated by tm , but by the kh instability .",
    "the presence of background flows in ccsne ( like convection or turbulence ) can affect the growth and termination of the mri , too .",
    "in 2d global simulations , @xcite observed the growth of coherent channel flows , albeit deformed , while @xcite observed the disruption of channel flows on timescales of milliseconds due to the presence of a dynamical background .",
    "both , the parasitic instabilities and the effect of the background flow , seem to disrupt channel flows on similar timescales .",
    "therefore , it is likely that both effects will be of relevance in studying the mri termination in global simulations .",
    "furthermore , the presence of parasitic instabilities implies the existence of a maximum magnetic stress at termination .",
    "this limits the ability of the mri to amplify the magnetic field to dynamically relevant values in ccsne .",
    "the turbulence triggered by the mri may amplify the global magnetic field further , if conditions for dynamo action are encountered .",
    "a study of the latter process is beyond the scope of this work , and will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "the mri has been traditionally invoked in the ccsn community as a justification to use supernova progenitors with an artificially enhanced initial magnetic field strength , @xmath397@xmath398 times larger than the values expected in stellar evolution models .",
    "this argumentation should be revisited if we want to move towards a more realistic modeling of magnetorotational core collapse .",
    "unfortunately , given the minimum numerical requirements that we provide in this work , 3d simulations seem nowadays unfeasible . to resolve mri channels of @xmath399 m length scale in a proto - neutron star of about @xmath400 km radius , with a resolution of @xmath401zones per channel , it would require about @xmath402grid zones .",
    "evolving this system for a typical dynamical timescale of the proto - neutron star evolution , @xmath403ms , would require about @xmath404 time steps , several zettabytes of memory and would consume @xmath405 cpu hours ( @xmath406iterations times @xmath402zones times @xmath407operations / zone at @xmath408gflops ) . with current petascale supercomputers",
    "this would amount to @xmath409yr of uninterrupted computation with @xmath410cores .",
    "a simulation which includes the whole iron core with a radius of @xmath411 km would be even more demanding .",

    "the use of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) techniques would alleviate , but not solve the problem .    the ccsn community has been performing 2d and 3d simulations with resolutions of up to @xmath322 m ( 2d ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath413 m ( 3d ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that these authors could afford such high resolutions only by accepting other limitations in terms of geometry and input physics , while other simulations use resolutions of several 100 m @xcite , which even for the artificially enhanced initial magnetic field , fail to resolve the termination process of the mri . given the above computational requirements , the community should rethink the way to model this scenario .",
    "the agreement that we have found here between local simulations and the parasitic instability analysis of gx94 and @xcite make us hope that there could be a way out . if we can understand how mri and turbulence work at sub - meter scales , this information could be incorporated in global simulations using appropriate subgrid models . as a first step along this path",

    "<S> , we find that at least @xmath0 grid zones per mri channel are necessary to simulate the growth phase of the mri and reach an accuracy of @xmath1 in the growth rate , while more than @xmath2 zones per channel are required to achieve convergent results for the value of the magnetic stress at mri termination .    </S>",
