    "amorphous and granular materials have a strong tendency to develop localized deformation when submitted to shear deformation .",
    "this deformation concentrates usually in narrow regions , called shear bands . upon a uniform rate of shear deformation ,",
    "the material experiences a finite , stationary deformation rate within the shear band , whereas the deformation rate is vanishingly small outside it.@xcite in some cases the existence of strain localization can be associated to a decreasing form of the stress as a function of strain rate in the material .",
    "this decreasing leads to instabilities that drive the formation of shear bands .",
    "an interesting limiting case corresponds to the so called quasi - static shear banding . in this case",
    "the applied strain rate is vanishingly small , and the velocity field across the sample must change by a factor when there is a change of the driving force by the same factor .",
    "it seems that in this case , an stationary , finite width shear band can only be obtained through the application of appropriate conditions at the boundaries that break the uniformity of the system .",
    "in fact , simulations of homogeneous amorphous materials well below the glass temperature show the existence of shear band which however thicken in time , eventually taking over the whole system . @xcite    a particular example in which the shear band is induced through the use of appropriate boundary conditions is the split - bottom container geometry introduced in @xcite in the form of a modified couette cell . in this configuration",
    "the bottom of the cell is split into two disks that rotate relatively to each other , and are attached to the inner and outer cylindrical wall of the cell .",
    "the sharp velocity interface at the bottom of the container induces an abrupt change of the velocity profile of the material close to this split line .",
    "experiments using granular materials show that in these conditions the material inside the cell reaches ( on average ) a stable configuration in which the transition between particles moving rigidly with one or the other part of the bottom surface occurs in a transition zone that defines the shear band .",
    "the form of this zone is well defined and non - singular even in the limit of ` quasi - static ' shear bands , i.e , when the relative velocity of both parts of the container is vanishingly small .",
    "however , when horizontal planes progressively away of the bottom are considered ( and thus the influence of the split - bottom decreases ) , the width of the shear zone becomes larger , and no upper limit seems to exist .",
    "the width of the shear band starts as zero right at the bottom of the container , and progressively increases when moving upwards , being maximum at the free surface .",
    "the detailed study of the form of this profile is the subject of this paper .",
    "the geometry that i will use here is a more symmetric version of the split - bottom experiment , which is depicted in fig .",
    "the bottom of the container defines the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , which is split along the @xmath6 line .",
    "the @xmath7 direction is perpendicular to the bottom plane .",
    "the system is infinite in the @xmath5 direction ( in the three dimensional numerical implementation , periodic boundary conditions along @xmath5 will be used ) .",
    "the configuration is symmetric upon a change of sign of the @xmath4 coordinate , and thus the center of the shear band is always located at @xmath6 .",
    "note that this applies to the _ time averaged _ position of the shear band , and not necessarily to an instantaneous configuration . we will come back to this fact in the discussions .",
    "this geometry has been analyzed numerically using frictional , spherical particles in @xcite .",
    "to predict , or justify , the form of the shear band we have to make assumptions about the structural response of the medium .",
    "one of the simplest starting points to model a plastic material is the assumption of ` perfect plasticity ' . under this hypothesis",
    ", each piece of material behaves elastically at small deformation , i.e. , the stress is proportional to the strain , but if some threshold deformation is over passed , the stress remains constant .",
    "it can be shown that if this simple prescription is followed , a singular shear band is obtained that goes from the split line at the bottom to the free surface at the top.@xcite if the threshold deformation is uniform in the sample the shear band is a vertical plane above the split line , namely the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane . however",
    ", if different thresholds are assigned to different points of the sample the shear band obtained is the homogeneous projection in the @xmath5 direction of a wavy line in the @xmath7-@xmath4 that goes between the split line at the bottom , and the free top surface .",
    "this shear surface can be obtained as the one that minimizes the energy generated as ` heat of friction ' during sliding .     and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the top surface is free of force .",
    "the velocity of the material match these values close to the bottom surface , and interpolates continuously in the bulk , as indicated schematically .",
    "( b ) a ` split top - bottom ' geometry .",
    "now the top surface is also split into two , like the bottom .",
    "note the definition of the height @xmath0 in both cases , which is made in this way to allow a better comparison . even in the absence of gravity effects",
    "is not obvious that the configuration in ( a ) should be equivalent to half of the configuration in ( b ) , as it is explained in the text .",
    ", width=302 ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , torok _ et al .",
    "_ put forward the idea that this minimal path is not persistent in time , since upon some rearrangement of the particles , the thresholds near the shearing surface are likely to change , and the path can move around slightly . in this way , a fluctuating path connecting the split point and free surface is obtained .",
    "it was thus suggested that the average configuration of this fluctuating path produces the continuum shear band observed in the experiments .",
    "simulations based on the two - dimensional version of this idea ( in which the @xmath5 coordinate is eliminated , and the problem is solved in the @xmath7-@xmath4 plane , assuming homogeneity along @xmath5 ) find a shear band that , after time averaging , is an object that widens from bottom to top .",
    "an interesting magnitude that has been studied with some detail in this context is the scaling of the width @xmath9 of the shear band at the surface as a function of the cell height @xmath0 . in the first reported experimental work",
    "@xcite it was found that there is a power law dependence for this quantity , with the shear band width @xmath9 scaling as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 between 0.5 and 1.0 . in the numerical work of torok _",
    "@xcite , a value close to 2/3 was found for @xmath11 , and it was noticed that this is the analytical value known to occur in the case of directed polymers ( dps ) in @xmath12 dimensions.@xcite after this , it seems that people have taken the value of 2/3 as a reference , and systematically try to scale the results of experiments or simulations with this value .    in my view",
    "there is not any strong reason why this should be the exact scaling exponent .",
    "the only point to be remarked is that the problem of dps at zero temperature @xcite is in essence very similar to the case of the fluctuating shear line in two dimensions .",
    "the main difference is that in the case of polymers the whole distribution of thresholds ( and not only close to the shear line ) is updated in every time step .",
    "an additional difference is that the model in @xcite is not ` directed ' .",
    "however it is known that for polymers this restriction is not crucial either .",
    "the fluctuation of the tip of dps at the surface of the system is analytically known to grow as @xmath13 .",
    "however , the problem of the shear band is a continuous three dimensional one , and this makes the comparison with the dp rather obscure .",
    "much less experimental information exists on the width of the shear band inside the material , namely @xmath14 , for @xmath15 .",
    "this is in part originated in the difficulty to observe the movement of the particles in the bulk , although some advances have been made in this direction.@xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite , ries _",
    "_ did numerical simulations using a rather realistic three dimensional model of spherical particles interacting through friction contact forces .",
    "i consider that the results in this work complement nicely the available experimental measurements . in these simulations , in addition to the ( approximate ) 2/3 power scaling of @xmath16 , a quarter of a circle profile was adjusted for the width in the interior of the material , namely @xmath17",
    ".    it would be interesting to compare these results with the equivalent ones obtained with the previously mentioned model of fluctuating shear lines @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite are not very detailed concerning the width across the whole sample . coming to the problem of dps , to my surprise",
    "i have not found a detailed study of the full profile either , and then i set up a simulation code to study this case too .",
    "the results obtained for dps will be presented below .    the dp model , or the model of fluctuating shear line of ref .",
    "@xcite consider that instantaneously , the shear band connects the split - bottom point and the free surface by a single line that fluctuates in time .",
    "experimentally , there is no evidence that this is the case .",
    "in fact , even for the lowest velocities that can be measured , the velocity profiles that are observed seem to be continuous .",
    "this is one reason to try some model which is a bit more realistic and considers the possibility of continuous deformations , both in time and space .",
    "another reason to search for a more realistic model is the fact that the dp model , and the model of fluctuating shear line of ref .",
    "@xcite are eminently two dimensional , and can not be easily generalized to three dimensions.@xcite in fact , in three dimensions , an instantaneous slip surface can not occur throughout the system , unless its profile is independent of the third ( @xmath5 ) dimension .",
    "the problem of the width of a shear band we are discussing is really a three dimensional one .",
    "although it can be investigated by two dimensional models ( defined in the @xmath7-@xmath4 plane in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , it is not clear if there are crucial issues associated to the third direction . in this sense , note that the problem is homogeneous in the @xmath5 direction only on average , but not instantaneously due to the randomness of the material . the model presented in the next section",
    "can be implemented in three dimensions , and i will present results both for two and three dimensions .",

    "the strain field is defined by the two - component vector @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "a perfectly elastic two dimensional material is modeled through the local free energy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is related to an elastic constant of the material .",
    "a plastic material possesses a plastic strain field @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 , @xmath4 ) , in such a way that the local free energy reads    @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\ f&=&\\int f(x , y ) dxdy \\label{f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the time evolution of @xmath18 can be considered to be determined in the quasi - static limit by a relaxational first order equation of the form    @xmath26    the model must be complemented by the time evolution of the plastic strain . in principle , a totally deterministic model for the evolution of @xmath23 could be tried .",
    "for instance , we can postulate that if the local energy exceeds some threshold value , the system adjusts its plastic strain to reduce the local free energy .",
    "however , all attempts to implement this kind of deterministic model led in the present geometry to a singular slip surface , i.e. , to a shear band of zero width . in order to obtain a shear band of finite width , the totally averaged , deterministic evolution does not seem to be enough , a stochastic component must remain.@xcite there are different possibilities for the choice of the stochastic evolution , but i think the kind of results that are obtained is rather independent of the details .",
    "the model adopted here is the following .",
    "i start with a zero local plastic strain . upon evolution",
    "according to eq .",
    "[ edet ] , the strain field @xmath27 changes , and also does the local energy @xmath28 ( eq . [ f ] ) .",
    "the plastic strain is fixed to zero until @xmath28 overpasses some local threshold value @xmath29 , then the value of @xmath30 is set instantaneously to the local value of the strain . in this way",
    "the local free energy is relaxed to zero .",
    "in addition , a new , random value of @xmath29 is chosen .",
    "this accommodation of the plastic strain can be considered to be the plastic events that occur in the system , which allow to produce a potentially very large deformation , at the cost of a moderate energy consumption .",
    "first of all i will present the results obtained using the dp model . as a first check , i reproduced with high precision the analytical 2/3 power for the scaling of the width at the surface if the number of elements of the polymer is sufficiently large , as can be seen in fig .",

    "it coincides at the surface with the previous curve , by definition , but is systematically different in the bulk . to my knowledge",

    "note that the half - profile for a dp fixed at both ends ( plotted also in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) shows clear differences with the free end case : the width of the free end case is systematically larger than the fixed end case , they only coincide asymptotically close to the fixed point .",

    "continuous lines : fitting using the random gaussian signals of ref .",
    "@xcite ( eq . [ w3 ] ) . , width=302 ]    to analyze these results in more detail , it turned out to be very successful to apply the theory of gaussian signals developed in ref .",
    "this consists in the study of the properties of a self - affine stochastic process , submitted to the appropriate boundary conditions , assuming a decomposition into uncorrelated fourier modes of gaussian amplitude .",
    "although the hypothesis of the modes being uncorrelated is usually not satisfied , this analysis is known in particular cases to provide results that fit the exact data with high accuracy.@xcite the simplest case to start with is that of the fixed ended polymer . in this case",
    "it is assumed that the stochastic process can be decomposed in fourier modes in the form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the @xmath4 coordinate of the polymer at height @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , @xmath33 are uncorrelated random numbers with zero mean and unitary variance , @xmath0 is the distance between the two fixed ends of the polymer , and @xmath34 is the amplitude of the corresponding mode . for self affine processes with scaling properties , the amplitudes @xmath34 must scale as a power of @xmath35 , namely @xmath36 , where an @xmath0-dependent global constant was introduced . by multiplying and taking averages over realizations",
    "we get the statistical width @xmath9 at distance @xmath7 of one fixed end as @xmath37 where i have made use of the fact that different @xmath33 are uncorrelated .",
    "the exponent @xmath38 can be related to our exponent @xmath11 for the expected scaling of the stochastic process at the surface .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath39 .",
    "thus we can write    @xmath40    as an example , note that the thermally fluctuating elastic line problem , has @xmath41 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ w22 ] ) gives    @xmath42    i.e. , the well known half circle , which is the exact result in this case . for dps",
    "we have @xmath43 , and the result for @xmath14 , fitting the global factor @xmath44 is shown on top of the numerical results in fig . [ f2 ] and can not be distinguished from the numerical data .",
    "going to the case of the free end polymer , note that in the problem of thermally fluctuating elastic line , only modes that reach the surface with zero derivative must be considered .",
    "this leads to a profile of the form @xmath45 where now the sum is over half the modes we had before .",
    "the result obtained scales as @xmath46 in particular , this profile does not have zero derivative at the surface , although it is constructed with modes that have zero derivative individually .",
    "coming back now to the free end dp polymer , an attempt can be made to fit the curve of an open end polymer weighting appropriately the modes with zero value at the surface , and those with zero derivative , keeping the self - affine nature of both of them individually .",
    "this corresponds to a width function of the form :    @xmath47    the best fitting to the numerical results is obtained when we choose @xmath48 , and @xmath44 as the same value used to fit the fixed end case .",
    "the fitting , shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , can not be distinguished from the numerical results either .",
    "note that having the same value of @xmath44 means that the asymptotic form of @xmath14 for @xmath49 is exactly the same for the free end and open end situations ( this is because the alternating in sign @xmath50 term in ( [ w3 ] ) introduces for small @xmath7 a contribution that is a larger power of @xmath7 than the main term ) .",
    "a very sensitive quantity that can be used to evaluate the results just presented is the local slope @xmath51 of the @xmath14 curve , defined as @xmath52 .",
    "these results , both from numerics and using the fitting with gaussian signals are shown in fig .",
    "two facts must be noticed : first , for open end polymers , the slope vanishes at the surface as @xmath53 , more abruptly than the linear vanishing of the fixed end case at the mid point .",
    "second , although the convergence is slow with system size , data seem to indicate that the form of @xmath14 for @xmath49 is @xmath54 , i.e. , it has the same exponent that the surface scaling ( which is , by the way , a property of the gaussian signal too ) .",
    "i will come back to the meaning of this fact in the last section .     and 1200 , and fixed end dp with @xmath55 , and the corresponding fitting according to random gaussian signals ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that for free end dps , the derivative vanishes at the surface at @xmath53 .",
    "note also that the data for small arguments tend to approach the trend of the continuous line as size is increased , although very slowly ( the blow - up shows only data for the open end case ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    at present , i do not have any explanation that justifies the accuracy of the fitting proposed , and neither an explanation for the remarkably value of @xmath50 obtained in the fitting of the open end polymer .",
    "the results just presented for dps will serve as a reference for comparing those obtained with the mesoscopic plastic model .      in a first stage , i implemented the plastic mesoscopic model on a two dimensional rectangular geometry corresponding to the @xmath7-@xmath4 plane in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , in which the border of the right half is given some velocity @xmath56 , and the border of the left half is given the opposite velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is set small enough for the total velocity field to be simply proportional to this value .    for the split bottom geometry ,",
    "the top surface is left free , i.e. , a condition of zero normal stress is applied . in some results presented , the top surface will be also split in the same manner that the bottom surface , and this will be a ` split top - bottom ' configuration . note that although i use the expressions ` top ' and ` bottom ' to agree with the experimental device , in the present case i do not include a gravitational field that singles out a vertical direction .",
    "this choice is made as the numerical simulations in @xcite indicate that gravity plays only a minor role in the structure of the shear band .",
    "simulations were performed for different values of the total height of the system @xmath0 , and in each case the size along the @xmath4 direction was chosen sufficiently large for the shear band not to be affected by the lateral walls ( typically , the size along @xmath4 is around ten times the expected value of @xmath9 at the surface ) .",
    "starting from rest , with both @xmath27 and @xmath23 set to zero , the simulation is initiated by applying a finite velocity @xmath57 to the left and right borders . at the first stages of the simulation , the system is seen to respond elastically , since in no place the value of @xmath58 is over passed . at some moment , @xmath58 is over passed for the first time at some place , the corresponding value of @xmath23 changes , and this feeds back to modify the evolution of @xmath27 .",
    "after many plastic events at different spatial positions , the system reaches a stationary state , ( on average , since stochastic fluctuations of the plastic strain remain ) , and at this stage statistics can be accumulated to get the average velocity field . in the simulations presented , the threshold values @xmath58 are chosen randomly in the interval @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a reference value .",

    "the model can thus be described as a collection of planes in which a set of equivalent two dimensional problems are defined , and where the plastic thresholds are chosen independently for each plane .",
    "the fundamental variable is then some @xmath92 where index @xmath93 labels the plane along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "planes are connected to nearest neighbor ones by purely elastic forces , in such a way that the total energy of the system is now    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the previous two dimensional free energy for plane @xmath93 .",
    "periodic boundary condition are applied along @xmath5 .",
    "the size of the system along @xmath5 should be chosen large enough . to keep a consistent implementation",
    ", this size is always chosen to be equal to the total thickness @xmath0 of the system .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath96 along @xmath5 is chosen to be equal to the linear elastic constant within the plane .",
    "note that no plastic threshold is implemented for the springs along @xmath5 .",
    "this version of the model was simulated in exactly the same manner as the two dimensional case .",
    "the results for the width function @xmath14 for systems of different sizes are shown in figs .",
    "[ f3d1 ] and [ f3d2 ] .",
    "data for different values of @xmath0 can again be scaled by plotting @xmath70 vs @xmath97 .",
    "the fitting of @xmath11 gives @xmath3 .    .",
    "( b)evolution of the value of @xmath9 at the surface with system size .",
    "the error bar is smaller than symbol size .",
    "the continuous line is the best fitting , with an exponent 0.60 .",
    "dotted lines have slope 0.55 and 0.65 , for comparison . , width=302 ]    ) are shown together with a fitting using a gaussian signals with exponent 0.60 and a quarter of circle profile .",
    "( b ) logarithmic derivative of the data in ( a ) , and the corresponding curves from gaussian signals and for a circle .",
    ", width=302 ]    two important differences appear between the three dimensional and the previous two dimensional simulations .",
    "first of all , the scaling of data for systems of different thickness is obtained using an exponent smaller than that of the two dimensional case , namely @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "the precision of the present simulations allows to claim that this difference is significant . in my view other numerical simulations as those in @xcite or experiments",
    "have not reached yet the point to tell the growing exponent with a precision of @xmath100 0.1 .",
    "i think a value close to 0.6 is consistent with the precision of accessible experimental results .",
    "more experimental work is needed concerning this point .",
    "the second difference between two and three dimensions is the overall shape of the @xmath14 function .",
    "the form of this function in 3d is much closer to a quarter of circle profile ( see fig .",
    "[ f3d2 ] ) .",
    "this may be an interesting observation when comparing with the results in @xcite , for instance .",
    "however , i have to mention that the fitting to this functional form does not seem to improve as the system size is increased , systematic differences apparently exist .",
    "related to this behavior , there is an interesting point to emphasize .",
    "given a set of curves @xmath14 for different thicknesses @xmath0 , if the scaling hypothesis holds we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an @xmath0-independent function .",
    "if we assume @xmath102 behaves as a power law ( with exponent @xmath103 ) for small values of its argument , we have @xmath104 note that unless @xmath105 , the behavior of @xmath9 close to the origin will depend on the value of @xmath0 , no matter how large this is . in particular , @xmath106 will increase without limit ( if @xmath107 ) or decrease to zero ( if @xmath108 ) as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this would be in my view a very strange behavior , although i have no rigorous argument against it . the dp curves shown in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] are in fact compatible with a @xmath86 power close to the fixed point , and for the two dimensional plastic mesoscopic model a value of @xmath109 seems to be compatible with data in figs .",
    "[ f51 ] and [ f52 ] .",
    "the situation is less clear in the three dimensional case .",
    "the value of @xmath11 was found to be around 0.60 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath110 from fig .",
    "[ f3d2 ] seems to be consistently closer to 0.5 ( which , by the way , is why the quarter of circle profile is accurate ) .",
    "it is not clear if the two exponents will show a tendency to become closer in larger system size simulations of if they will remain different .",
    "in this paper i presented results obtained for the ` split - bottom ' geometry using a mesoscopic model for the plasticity of an amorphous material .",
    "two and three dimensional results were reported .",
    "in particular , the exponent for the width @xmath9 of the shear band at the surface of the system for two dimensions was found to be 0.68 @xmath100 0.02 , comparable with the analytical 2/3 exponent obtained for directed polymers . in three dimensions the exponent was found to be somewhat slower , namely 0.60 @xmath100 0.02 .",
    "i want to recall however that the implementation of the three dimensional case was only partial , and a full modeling would be necessary to verify if this value remains valid in the full implementation . in two dimensions ,",
    "the full profile of the width in bulk @xmath14 was found to be well described by a random gaussian signal , and in particular it was found that no systematic differences appear between a system with a free top surface and system with a split surface at the top .",
    "this was not an obvious point from the beginning as the reference system for this study , namely the directed polymer , shows systematic differences between the two cases that i have addressed and described in terms of the theory of random gaussian signals . in three dimensions",
    ", it was observed that the form of @xmath14 can be fitted reasonably well by a quarter of circle profile , a result that has been obtained in previous work in a related model @xcite . a caveat about whether this scaling can continue to be valid for arbitrarily large systems",
    "was put forward .",
    "the number of experimental results that the present model describes , added to the very simple ingredients on which it is constructed , places it as a good candidate in which the deep origin of the regularities emerging from experiments can be elucidated .",
    "one promising route would be trying to generate continuous differential equations that describe the evolution of probability densities of the stochastic model .",
    "this is an interesting prospect for future work .",
    "in addition , i think that the results presented can be a motivation for experimentalists to obtain more accurate data of the quantities at play , to investigate how the values presented here fit the experiments .",
    "fruitful discussions with a. kolton , a. rosso , m. falk , w. losert and t. unger are greatly acknowledged .",
    "this research was financially supported by consejo nacional de investigaciones cientficas y tcnicas ( conicet ) , argentina .",
    "partial support from grants pip/5596 ( conicet ) and pict 32859/2005 ( anpcyt , argentina ) is also acknowledged .",
    "once the stochastic model is defined , one can try to obtain from it a smooth differential equation that describes the evolution of probability density in the stochastic model .",
    "this is like obtaining the fokker - planck equation from a langevin dynamical equation . in the present case",
    "i have no clues on how to obtain this effective equation .",
    "this is a very interesting issue to pursuit in the future ."
