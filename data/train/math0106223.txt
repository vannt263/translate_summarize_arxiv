    "in two recent papers , an empirical model for the distribution of twin primes was proposed  @xcite and some of its predictions were developed  @xcite .",
    "the foundation of this novel approach to the distribution of twins is that the sequence of twins is most naturally studied in the context of the primes rather than the natural numbers .    in  @xcite ,",
    "empirical evidence was presented which strongly supports the contention that within the set of prime numbers less than or equal to some number @xmath1 , twins ( pairs of primes with arithmetic difference 2 ) occur in the manner of fixed probability random events .",
    "this fact lies at the heart of the model .",
    "the probability is not constant however , rather it decreases with increasing @xmath1 , in accord with the hardy  littlewood conjecture .",
    "the third essential ingredient of the model is that the manner in which the probability changes can be expressed simply in terms of @xmath2 , the number of primes less than or equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the reader is referred to  @xcite for details .",
    "extensions of the empirical analysis by ourselves and others  @xcite verify the persistence of the model up to @xmath3 .",
    "it was noted first by j.  calvo  @xcite , and also independently by m.  wolf  @xcite , that in the course of developing the model for the distribution of twins we have taken an essentially discrete system of _ prime separations _",
    "( _ i.e. , _ the number of singleton primes which occur between a pair of neighbouring twins ) , and modelled it with a continuous distribution . another possible shortcoming of the model developed in  @xcite is that when we normalise the distribution we integrate over all ( continuous ) prime separations from 0 ( the most likely separation in the distributional model , see  @xcite ) to @xmath4 .",
    "it is formally impossible to take this limit at any finite @xmath1 , or even generally if the number of twins is infinite .",
    "we did so in our analysis because we believed that the error introduced was quite small .",
    "this was borne out by the apparent success of the model .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to address the two concerns : discrete analysis _ versus _ continuous , and taking into account the fact that for any @xmath1 there exists a maximum prime separation . in the next section",
    "the model is briefly reviewed and reformulated . in the following section we shall reanalyse with sums rather than passing to the integral representation .",
    "second , we shall self - consistently set an upper bound to the separations and incorporate its effects into our analysis .",
    "as a test of consistency , the predictions for upper bounds will be compared with the analysis of `` prime gaps '' in  @xcite .",
    "the model that we consider is empirical in that it is derived from a direct analysis of the distribution of twin primes less than @xmath5 . the essential feature which provides the key to the success of the model is that the distribution of twins is considered in the context of the primes alone rather than within the natural numbers .",
    "the model is based upon the observation that twins less than some number @xmath1 seem to occur as fixed - probability random events in the sequence of primes .",
    "that is , there is a characteristic distribution of _ prime separations _ which may expressed in the form @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the number of primes less than or equal to @xmath1 , @xmath8 is the _ prime separation _ ( the number of unpaired _ singleton _ primes occuring between two twins ) , and @xmath9 is a decay parameter which is constant for a given @xmath1 , but varies with @xmath2 , while @xmath10 is an overall constant which is fixed by normalisation .",
    "@xmath11 is the probability density that a given pair of twins in the sequence of primes up to @xmath1 has prime separation @xmath8 .",
    "when  ( [ prob ] ) is assumed to be continuous and extending to infinity , the condition that it be properly normalised , @xmath12 , constrains @xmath13 .",
    "we chose a representative sample of prime sequences and determined the decay constants for each .",
    "we began our analysis with @xmath14 , discarding the anomalous twin @xmath15 .",
    "the variation of the decay parameters  the slopes on a plot of log(frequency ) _ versus _ separation  is well - described by the following function : @xmath16 where the constant , @xmath17 , has been estimated to equal @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "our empirical model is founded upon a constructive procedure : from an exact knowledge of the distribution of separations , we determine the best - fit slope on a graph of @xmath19frequency@xmath20 _ vs. _ separation , giving each datum _ equal _ weight .",
    "the unfortunate aspect of this is that we are limited to the data that we have collected . in particular , various groups of researchers",
    "have _ counted _ primes and twins but they do not appear to have kept detailed counts of twin separations .",
    "further , we now believe that we understand better the difficulties which led us to eschew characterisation of the behaviour of twins solely in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "let us now make a proper case for consideration of an empirical model for the distribution of twins whose inputs are the counts @xmath2 and @xmath22 .",
    "recalling @xcite , especially the formulae @xmath23 and @xmath24 and figure 4 , ( reproduced here as figure 1 ) , in which the statistical average separation @xmath25 is expressed as the number of singletons divided by the number of twins , and @xmath26 is the reciprocal of the estimated slope , we write @xmath27 it was readily apparent that the slopes @xmath9 , determined as described above , and quantities @xmath28 as in ( [ s_average ] ) , closely correspond at large values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is equally apparent that they differ significantly at smaller values .",
    "this is the region where the relatively strong enhancement of the few `` large '' separation events had the greatest effect in reducing the magnitude of the computed slopes .",
    "this in turn enabled the success of our simple and straightforward empirical model for the variation of the slope with @xmath7 .",
    "-90 = 3.5 in = 4.5 in    we set out to understand better the behaviour at the low end of the curve in figure  [ graph1 ] , by reconsideration of @xmath25 as a function of @xmath29 . in figure  [ graph2 ]",
    "the @xmath25 derived from nicely s data , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 .",
    "we have adjusted the @xmath0 to discard the singleton primes which appear after the last twin less than @xmath1 . ]",
    "appear to follow very closely along a straight line with slope @xmath30 and @xmath31-intercept @xmath32 . the negative value for the @xmath31-intercept , implying a positive value for the @xmath33-intercept initially appeared to us to be pathological and prevented us from arriving at a simple empirical characterisation for the variation of the nicely data .",
    "we now argue that this pathology is relatively benign , as the @xmath33-intercept has such a small value , here @xmath34 , that @xmath35 is less than 5 , and thus the value of @xmath1 to which it corresponds is less than @xmath36 .",
    "we have no expectation that our statistical model can produce meaningful results for short sequences of primes , and so this value for the @xmath33-intercept is truly and completely extraneous .",
    "-90 = 3.5 in = 4.5 in    thus , for the purposes of this paper , we have reformulated the fundamentally empirical model that we proposed in @xcite in such a way that we characterise the probability distribution for the twin separations not in terms of the `` decay constant '' @xmath9 and its proper variation with @xmath1 as before , but instead in terms of the `` mean separation '' @xmath26 and its concommitant proper variation .",
    "it is most likely the case that this reformulation is best suited for further development as it relies exclusively on data obtained solely by counting primes and twins .",
    "henceforth we will rewrite ( [ prob ] ) as @xmath37 our empirical model ( figure  [ graph2 ] ) strongly suggests that @xmath38 varies with @xmath0 as @xmath39 and we ve written @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the constants whose values are empirically determined to be @xmath30 , and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we further insist that @xmath42 as discussed above .",
    "the relation that exists between @xmath26 and @xmath38 is revealed in the next section .",
    "normalising the probability distribution for the occurrence of prime separations yields @xmath43 where we have interpreted the @xmath44 as relative frequencies rather than absolute counts ( in which case the _ lhs _ of ( [ norm ] ) would equal @xmath45 , the total number of twins less two and the prime separations are intervals between neighbouring twins . ] and have inserted as an _ ansatz _ the empirical relation ( [ sprob ] ) .",
    "@xmath46 denotes the maximum prime separation , thereby truncating the sum .",
    "_ a priori _ @xmath46 is not specified and a value must be assumed or self - consistently derived .    a second relation among @xmath47 , @xmath26 and @xmath46 is formed by consideration of the frequency - weighted average prime separation , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath48 in fact , a note of caution is required here .",
    "our empirical analysis discards the first twin and considers separations , so `` @xmath49 '' should be replaced by @xmath45 , and to be consistent `` @xmath7 '' should be @xmath50 since we pass over the primes @xmath51 and @xmath52 . incorporating these minor offsets into ( [ snaught ] ) results in the @xmath53 which is only slightly different from the simpler and more straightforward expression that we use .",
    "a third relation among the parameters comes from assigning a cut - off for the probability distribution for prime separations .",
    "the _ ansatz _ ( [ sprob ] ) has no such cut - off built into it , although one might try to use the `` scale '' set by @xmath26 to establish one by",
    "_ fiat _ ( say , @xmath54 ) .",
    "instead , we shall adopt the general method utilised in @xcite , and set a minimum probability threshold with the introduction of a so - called risk factor @xmath55 . in effect",
    "@xmath55 prime separation events with prime separations greater than @xmath46 are be expected to occur in the context of the probabilistic model",
    ". then we may write @xmath56 providing a self - consistent cut - off value for the sum over separations .",
    "thus we have a set of three equations with three known quantities , the counts of primes and twins , @xmath0 and @xmath21 respectively , for a given @xmath1 and the risk factor @xmath55 , and three parameters to be determined : @xmath47 , @xmath26 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we now proceed to solve these equations in two distinct instances : the first in which we formally set @xmath57 in which case @xmath58 , and the second , where @xmath55 is specified ( non - zero ) .      with @xmath57 and @xmath58 equation ( [ cut - off ] )",
    "has no content and ( [ norm ] ) and ( [ snaught ] ) can be solved exactly . the solutions are @xmath59 \\ , \\label{soln1s}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 we note three things about this solution .",
    "the first is that @xmath26 and @xmath47 depend on @xmath0 and @xmath21 and hence @xmath1 _ implicitly _ via @xmath25 .",
    "the second is that with increasing @xmath1 the density of twins decreases , @xmath25 increases , and @xmath61 as is easily seen by expanding ( [ soln1s ] ) in this limit .",
    "third , we remark that m.  wolf obtains a similar result  @xcite , except that he assumes _ a priori _ that @xmath62 in order to simplify his analysis whereas our result is exact .      formally performing the summations and rearranging , ( [ norm ] ) ,",
    "( [ snaught ] ) , and ( [ cut - off ] ) may be cast into the following useful forms ( letting @xmath63 denote @xmath64 ) : @xmath65 these may be solved numerically for the set of parameters : @xmath47 , @xmath26 and @xmath46 once the inputs @xmath66 , @xmath49 , and @xmath55 are specified .    instead ,",
    "to get an idea of the general behaviour , we make a well - motivated approximation to the final equation listed . in the regime described by the model , @xmath67 , for reasonable values of @xmath55 , and we expect that the factor of @xmath68 is insufficient to render the second term on the @xmath69 appreciable",
    ". put another way , the average value of the separation is rather insensitive to the precise value of the maximum separation because relatively few separation events are maximal or near maximal .",
    "writing @xmath70 we immediately see that the solution for @xmath26 is exactly the same as above ( [ soln1s ] ) . while this is an approximation ,",
    "it is also a consequence of the relative insensitivity to the cut - off as was strongly suggested by the success of the continuous analysis in @xcite . with this result in hand , it is possible to solve for @xmath47 and @xmath46 without further approximations .",
    "the normalisation constant @xmath71 is shifted slightly greater than its value derived in the case of no cut - off , while @xmath72 }   \\ , , \\label{soln2l}\\ ] ] describes the growth in the cutoff in terms of the prime counts , statistical average separation , and risk factor .    in figure  [ graph3 ]",
    "we have replotted the actual thresholds obtained in our analysis of the likely maximal separations as performed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we now include values of @xmath46 predicted by ( [ soln2l ] ) using nicely s counts of primes and twins as inputs , and choosing the risk factor to be equal to @xmath73 .",
    "-90 = 3.5 in = 4.5 in    in the region in which there is overlap between the observed thresholds , our earlier computed estimates for the maximum separation at given @xmath1 , and the results obtained by direct computation using ( [ soln2l ] ) the agreement is exceptional .",
    "the spectacular agreement between the predicted cut - offs and the maximal gap predictions of  @xcite persists above the range over which we have data .",
    "while this was not unexpected , it provides further reassurance of the consistency of our model for the distribution of twins .",
    "very careful examination of the curve in figure  [ graph2 ] reveals that the data exhibit a slight tendency suggestive of negative curvature .",
    "naive theoretical considerations suggest attempting a three - parameter fit of the form @xmath74 fitting to the same data as before the empirical values obtained for the constants @xmath41 , @xmath40 , and @xmath75 are @xmath76 from a practical perspective , it will require considerable effort to extend the data into a regime in which the three parameter fit is clearly distinguished from the linear approximation .",
    "this is just a manifestation of the extremely slow growth of the function @xmath77 .",
    "we also note that the pathology of negative intercepts reappears with increased strength .",
    "again , however , we can claim that this pathology is benign since it implies a lower limit @xmath78 , leading to an estimate that @xmath79 is on the order of @xmath80 , which is also far below the regime in which our statistical model is applicable .",
    "furthermore , the precise values obtained for @xmath41 and @xmath75 were rather sensitive to the range of data over which the fit was performed which leads us to believe that safer estimates for these coefficients and their errors are @xmath81    in this paper , we have strengthened the case for , and extended the utility of , our characterisation of the the distribution of twin primes as random fixed - probability `` events '' among the primes .",
    "we have done this by first performing the analysis of the model without passing to the continuous ( integral ) limit and have demonstrated that there are no obstacles .",
    "furthermore we have made new and self - consistent predictions for the occurrence of `` gaps '' ( maximum separations ) and these are seen to conform well to the actual data and to our previous model analysis .",
    "perhaps the most important result going forward is our successful reformulation of the model which has enabled it to accept as inputs the raw counts of primes and twins below a certain @xmath1 , along with a risk - factor ( of order 1 ) to which the model is fairly insensitive .",
    "lastly , we note that , particularly in this reformulated form without accounting for the cutoff , the empirical model is _ predictive _ since the factors which enter into the _ ansatz _ ( [ sprob ] ) , @xmath47 and @xmath26 , are determined from @xmath25 alone whose behaviour is captured by ( [ snaughtempirical ] ) . given additional knowledge of @xmath22 we can choose a risk - factor and determine a more precise prediction for the spectrum including maximal expected prime separation .",
