    "am important problem in the study of stellar populations is that of deriving ages and abundances for early - type galaxies .",
    "these are the most massive galaxies in the universe and thought to be amongst the oldest . in principle",
    ", therefore , their study offers one of the best probes of the early star formation history and chemical evolution of the universe .    in this study , a progress report on our continuing exploration ( see @xcite ) of old stellar populations at ultraviolet wavelengths , we investigate the usefulness of mid - uv / optical broadband colors .",
    "a well - known problem in population synthesis is the `` age - metallicity degeneracy , '' ( @xcite and references therein ) by which populations of different age and abundance can have nearly indistinguishable light measures ( _ viz . _ colors , absorption line strengths ) .",
    "broadband optical colors are particularly susceptible to this problem .",
    "figure  ( [ uvbv ] ) shows that observed integrated colors of , for example , @xmath3 @xmath4 are consistent with a wide range of both ages and metallicities for typical observational uncertainties .",
    "= 4.5truein    however , broadband colors have several important advantages over narrower band measures , in particular    * since they are influenced mainly by regions of low atmospheric optical depth , they are easier to model theoretically than are individual features  which are often subject to poorly modeled effects ; * it is easier to achieve high s / n ratios in broader indices ; * they are not strongly affected by factors such as velocity dispersion or emission features .    in the absence of young stellar components and",
    "the hot component that gives rise to the ` uv - upturn ' or ` uvx ' phenomenon @xcite , the mid - uv flux is dominated by the light of main sequence turnoff stars .",
    "the turnoff light is much more sensitive to age than is the light of red - giant stars , which dominate at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "the uv is also more sensitive to stellar temperature and line blanketing than are longer wavelengths .",
    "hence , we expect indicators derived from the mid - uv to be considerably better probes of population characteristics .",
    "we show that this is true for mid - uv broad - band colors , and we then address the question of how much photometric precision is necessary to draw conclusions from these such measurements .",
    "we have used the hst / wfpc2 filters f218w , f255w , and f300w to exemplify the behavior of broadband mid - uv indices .",
    "these filters have central wavelengths and effective widths defined in @xcite as follows f218w ",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 f255w ",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 f300w ( the `` wide u '' used in the hubble deep field exposures ) @xmath9 @xmath10 the potential utility of mid - uv broadband colors is illustrated by figure  [ 25vbv ] . the two - color separation between model sequences at different @xmath1",
    "is seen to be much greater in @xmath11 than in @xmath12 in particular , the model pair ( 6 gyr , 3@xmath13 ) and ( 16 gyr , @xmath13 ) , cited by worthey @xcite as indistinguishable at optical wavelengths , is well separated in the uv / optical colors ( a full difference spectrum is shown in @xcite ) .",
    "some ranges of metallicity , or significant minority fractions thereof , are excluded altogether by existing broadband observations of e galaxies .",
    "for example , for the galaxies presented in table 1 of @xcite , @xmath14 this excludes most of the models with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 .",
    "an even greater separation between models is present in the @xmath16 two - color plane .",
    "however , note that the model sequences for constant age or constant @xmath1 still overlap in color  implying that the `` degeneracy '' problem is still present , if less serious than in the optical .",
    "in addition , uv fluxes can not yet be measured with the same precision as optical fluxes due to remaining calibration problems and the faintness of galaxies in the uv .",
    "in this section we formulate a criterion for the distinguishability of stellar population parameters from a given set of observations .",
    "let @xmath17 be some measure of a galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) such as a color or absorption line index .",
    "suppose the light - weighted mean age and abundance of its population are @xmath18 and @xmath19 the range of models that produce a value of @xmath17 within a given observational uncertainty , @xmath20 , is the set of @xmath21 where    = 4.5truein    @xmath22    for a set of @xmath23 indices @xmath24 the range of models consistent with the observation is the _ error ellipse _ in the @xmath2 plane defined by the r.m.s .",
    "differences in colors between theory and observation is determined by    @xmath25 ^ 2 } <   \\sigma_{\\rm obs}.\\ ] ]    using the partial derivatives of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 we obtain an expression for @xmath26 in terms of the relative sensitivity of the colors to these parameters :    @xmath27    where the derivatives are both positive in the age range of interest ( colors become redder with both @xmath0 and @xmath1)$ ] owing to line saturation . in this case equation  ( [ final ] ) must be modified to include higher - order derivative terms . ] ) .",
    "worthey @xcite has defined `` metallicity sensitivity '' indices in terms of the ratios ( i.e.  relative sizes ) of the partial derivatives in this expression .",
    "however , it is important to note from equations ( [ sig ] ) and ( [ final ] ) that @xmath2 separation also depends on the absolute size of the partial derivatives and on the available observational precision @xmath20 ( which determines the size of the error ellipse ) .",
    "figure  [ ellipse ] shows the error ellipse contours of @xmath28 as defined in equation  ( [ r ] ) . to construct this plot ,",
    "we have selected a model ( 10 gyr , [ fe / h ] = 0 , indicated by the filled circle ) and determined its rms separation from other models in various colors . in panel ( a ) the contours are derived using only @xmath29 while panel ( b ) is constructed using mid - uv / optical colors in addition .",
    "even for the highest precision plotted , there is a `` valley of degeneracy '' running diagonally across both figures wherein @xmath2 separation is impossible .",
    "this is the `` 3/2 '' band discussed by worthey @xcite .",
    "it is much broader in the optical than in the uv bands .",
    "the innermost contour plotted in both panels is 0.03 mag , a precision that can be routinely achieved for nearby galaxies in the optical but not currently in the uv .",
    "however , note that for optical bands , as stressed by worthey and his collaborators , the degree of observational precision required to separate models is much better than 0.03 mag .",
    "the uv colors yield better separation for @xmath30 than do the optical colors at @xmath31 .",
    "in practice , the mid - uv will often suffer measureable contamination from the uvx , @xcite",
    ". however , this is easily removed , as discussed in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the age - abundance degeneracy problem is difficult and persists at some level in all wavelength regimes which have been studied . in the case of the mid - uv colors we discussed here ,",
    "degeneracy is much smaller at a given level of observational precision than at optical wavelengths . if there is independent information on abundance , constraints on age from mid - uv colors are strong ( see fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] ) .",
    "it is clear from this discussion that the usefulness of various spectral indices must be judged in terms of both their sensitivities ( i.e.  partial derivatives ) to the basic @xmath2 parameters and the likely observational precision possible in practical applications .",
    "we doubt that robust @xmath2 separation is possible for old stellar populations without excellent observational precision in multiple spectral indices or colors over a long wavelength baseline ( including the mid - uv ) @xmath32 .",
    "it is also essential to evaluate the systematic errors introduced by modeling uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these issues further in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
