    "ring laser gyroscopes ( rlgs ) operate laser action on counter - propagating waves and measure their frequency difference ( beat frequency ) due to the sagnac effect @xcite .",
    "the main problems for operation are caused by the effects of backscattering and nonlinearity inherent in a gain medium .",
    "for instance , when the rotation rate of the rlg is slow , frequency - locking effect induced by backscattering occurs between the counter - propagating waves and eliminates the beat frequency due to the sagnac effect ( sagnac beat frequency ) , which is well - known as the lock - in phenomenon @xcite . in conventional he",
    "- ne rlgs , avoiding the lock - in phenomenon has been one of the important issues in order to measure the beat frequency at slow rotation rates , and many investigations have been intensively done for this purpose .    while conventional rlgs utilize a gaseous medium ( he - ne ) as a gain medium , a new type of rlg using solid states and a semiconductor material",

    "as is well - known , the nonlinearity inherent in these gain media leads to a spatial hole burning effect and suppresses one of the counter - propagating waves due to gain competition ( in an ideal ring laser without backscattering and noise sources ) , unlike in the case of gaseous medium @xcite .",
    "while several theoretical and experimental works exist for solidstate rlgs , many of the investigations have so far focused on overcoming or controlling such a nonlinearity @xcite . meanwhile , backscatter - induced phenomenon , such as lock - in , and the properties of the rlgs at slow rotation rates have not yet been examined in detail .    in this paper , we theoretically and numerically study the effect of backscattering on the rlgs . in the description , we use the maxwell - bloch equations , which consists of the maxwell equations rewritten in a rotating frame of reference and the bloch equations that have been used as a simple model of solid - state gain media or as a semiconductor material .",
    "we show that sagnac beat frequencies can be observed without the lock - in phenomenon , if the strength of backscattering originating in the bumps of the refractive index is larger than a certain value . in this case",
    ", we found that the rotation rate dependence of the beat frequency can not be described by a conventional theory of the sagnac effect , which gives a linear relation between the beat frequency and the cavity rotation rate @xcite .",
    "instead , we demonstrate that it follows a novel formula of the sagnac effect incorporating the effect of backscattering , which have been derived in ref .",
    "in addition , we report that such rotation rate dependence can actually be observed without the lock - in phenomenon in a semiconductor fiber - optic ring laser gyroscope ( s - fog ) @xcite , which is composed of a semiconductor optical amplifier as a gain medium and optical fibers to form a ring cavity .",

    "( [ freqd ] ) can be observed without the lock - in phenomenon .",
    "we also showed that the experimental results corresponding to the theoretical one is actually obtained in a s - fog .",
    "we believe that the property that lock - in phenomenon does not occur is not unique for s - fogs but universal for rlgs using solidstate and semiconductor as gain medium .",
    "we thank professor ezekiel , mr .",

    "we also thank t. miyasaka for numerical simulations and s. shinohara for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the national institute of information and communication technology of japan .",
    "let us explain the numerical simulation method of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sb-1])-([eq : sb-3 ] ) .",
    "the approximated maxwell equation ( [ eq : sb-1 ] ) has identical form to the schrdinger equation with absorption @xmath231 , polarization @xmath156 , and noise @xmath232 ; it allows us to use the techniques of the symplectic - integrator method @xcite to carry out numerical simulations of dynamics .",
    "we divide eq .",
    "( [ eq : sb-1 ] ) into wave propagation , polarization , and noise parts .",
    "the time evolution operator of the wave propagation part is given as @xmath233 , where @xmath234 consists of the kinetic energy part @xmath235 and the potential part including linear absorption term @xmath236 as @xmath237 .",
    "if time @xmath238 is very small , the time - evolution operator can be split based on the symplectic - integrator method as follows : @xmath239 the next time - step value of electronic field @xmath240 is calculated by operating the split @xmath241 on the previous time - step value @xmath242 and including the contribution of the polarization term and a noise term up to the first order correction of @xmath238 : @xmath243 where @xmath244 .    equation ( [ simu - e ] ) can be calculated by the following procedures ; first , potential part @xmath245 is operated on @xmath242 , ( @xmath246 ) .",
