    "quantum coherence is the key ingredient in all quantum phenomena , from quantum optics and quantum information  @xcite to condensed matter physics and quantum thermodynamics  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the scientific community has started a significant effort towards the rigorous exploration of quantum coherence , including its qualification , quantification , and operational significance , along conceptual and mathematical lines analogous to the ones previously followed for the rigorous qualification and quantification of quantum entanglement and quantum correlations .",
    "so far , the investigation have been limited to states of finite - dimensional quantum systems . in this respect , following the seminal identification of entropic and geometric quantifiers and the axiomatic properties that must be satisfied by any proper measure of quantum coherence  @xcite , important progress has included the classification of single - qubit incoherent quantum operations  @xcite , the characterization of quantum coherence in two - qubit bell - diagonal states  @xcite , and the first results on the operational significance of quantum coherence for quantum technology protocols  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has recently been shown that quantum coherence can be exploited to activate quantum entanglement and other useful quantum correlations  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , continuous variable ( cv ) states of infinite - dimensional systems are of fundamental importance both from theoretical and experimental point of view ; in particular a lot of work has been dedicated to gaussian states and gaussian channels , as they are both theoretically easy to manage and experimentally easy to produce . moreover , although non - gaussian cv states have been proved quite useful in particular cases , such as cv quantum teleportation  @xcite , gaussian states constitute the foundation of every quantum processing tasks in the cv setting . as a consequence , it is important to generalize the quantification of quantum coherence and the classification of quantum incoherent operations to the case of gaussian states .    in this work",
    "we follow the geometric approach pioneered by baumgratz , cramer , and plenio  @xcite , and we compute different distance measures in detail for the main classes of single - mode gaussian states .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we briefly review the basic formalism of single - mode gaussian states . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we classify the set of incoherent single - mode gaussian states , namely those states that have diagonal density matrix in the fock basis , showing that they correspond to purely thermal states with zero displacement and zero squeezing . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we define quantum coherence as the minimal distance from the set of thermal states and we introduce two such geometric measures , respectively in terms of the bures and hellinger metric . in sec .  [ sec4 ] we explicitly compute the given measures for the most significant classes of single - mode gaussian states as functions of different physical parameters such as displacement , squeezing , and thermal noise . in particular , we show that squeezed thermal states feature a remarkable phenomenon of noise - enhanced quantum coherence with increasing number of thermal photons at fixed squeezing . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we draw our conclusions and discuss future research on the extension to multimode gaussian states and the application to cv quantum technologies . in the app .",
    "[ app1 ] we include various mathematical and calculational details leading to the results presented in the main text .",
    "in this section we briefly review the mathematical formalism aiming at describing one - mode gaussian states .",
    "+ every single - mode gaussian state can be expressed in the following form  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the displacement operator with complex amplitude @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the squeezing operator with squeezing parameter @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the one - mode thermal state : @xmath6    due to the gaussian form of the wigner function representing these states in the phase space , they are characterized uniquely by the first moments ( the displacement vector ) :    @xmath7,im[\\beta ] ) \\label{firstm}\\ ] ]    and second moments ( the covariance matrix ) : @xmath8 with @xmath9    this parametrization will be useful for the study of quantum coherence for the classes of gaussian state considered in sec .",
    "in this section we identify the set of one - mode gaussian incoherent states .",
    "indeed , we obtain the following result :    a single mode gaussian state is incoherent if and only if the covariance matrix @xmath10 is diagonal , there is not displacement and squeezing .    by definition  @xcite , a single mode incoherent state is represented by a diagonal density matrix @xmath11 ,    @xmath12    it is easy to verify that the corresponding _ cm _",
    "@xmath13 is diagonal with elements @xmath14 with @xmath15 , while the first moments @xmath16 and @xmath17 are null , so that the displacement is zero .",
    "so if the state is incoherent , that is described by the density matrix @xmath11 , the corresponding _ cm _",
    "@xmath13 is such that the elements have to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath18 referring explicitly to the generic single mode gaussian state eq .",

    "the vector of the first moments @xmath19 eq .",
    "( [ firstm ] ) is null just for @xmath20 ( no displacement ) .",
    "similarly , the conditions eq.s ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) are satisfied by the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( no squeezing ) , for which @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this means that a single mode gaussian state is incoherent when there is no squeezing and no displacement thermal state . under these conditions the generic gaussian state eq .",
    "( [ gensinglemode ] ) becomes thermal one .",
    "so , we have shown that a single mode gaussian state is incoherent if it is a thermal state , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "let consider now a gaussian state described by a diagonal _ cm _ and without squeezing and displacement .",

    "indeed a density matrix represented by a diagonal _ cm _ and by at least no null value between @xmath2 and @xmath28 is nt diagonal , @xmath29 just as a the density matrix of a state with @xmath30 and not diagonal _",
    "cm_.    in conclusion , the only incoherent single mode gaussian states are the thermal states , described by the cm : @xmath31    this class of states will be the reference set from which it is necessary to calculate the minimum distance .",

    "the uhlmann fidelity  @xcite is found to be : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the difference between the first moments vectors of the relative states @xmath33 and @xmath11 . in the previous section we showed that the class of the incoherent states has null first moments ; hence @xmath40 eq .
