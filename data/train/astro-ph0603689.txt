    "the questions of how and when the universe was re - ionized and the history of galaxy formation and metal enrichment appear to be intimately linked . observations of @xmath18 quasars and the cosmic microwave background indicate that re - ionization occurred at @xmath23 @xcite , but most likely not by quasars alone @xcite . instead",
    ", star - forming galaxies and/or massive population iii stars may have played a dominant role in this process ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to assess this possibility it is essential to trace the properties and evolution of galaxies and star formation at @xmath24 . in recent years",
    ", large surveys using narrow - band ly@xmath12 and lyman drop - out selection have uncovered @xmath25 candidate @xmath26 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , of which about a half have been confirmed spectroscopically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys provide initial estimates of the star formation rate density and luminosity function at these redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , one of the most crucial measurements in the study of galaxy evolution , the metallicity , is beyond the reach of current studies , since at @xmath27 the relevant emission lines are very weak and are redshifted to the mid - ir .",
    "moreover , since spectroscopic confirmation relies on ly@xmath12 emission , which is easily obscured by dust , the current samples may be intrinsically biased with respect to dust and metallicity .",
    "the alternative approach of studying damped ly@xmath12 absorbers ( dlas ) detected against background quasars also appears to be limited to @xmath28 @xcite , and is moreover biased in favor of extended halo gas , which at lower redshifts significantly underestimates the disk metallicities . as a result ,",
    "the apparent evolution in the mass- and luminosity - metallicity relations ( @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 ) from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not be traced to @xmath32 , where such information should shed light on the initial stages of mass build - up and metal enrichment .    for many years",
    "it has been speculated that grbs should exist at @xmath18 and can therefore provide an alternative way to study re - ionization and to select star - forming galaxies .",
    "a truly unique and exciting aspect of grbs is that spectroscopy of their bright afterglows can easily provide a redshift measurement from uv metal absorption features and/or ly@xmath12 absorption , bypassing the reliance on faint ly@xmath12 emission lines .",
    "more importantly , grb absorption spectroscopy also provides a measure of the metallicity and kinematics of the interstellar medium _ at the location where active star formation is taking place _ , and may potentially provide direct information on the nature of the massive progenitor itself .",
    "this powerful probe of the metallicity in star forming galaxies , and its redshift evolution , is now being routinely used for a rapidly - growing sample at @xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hope of extending this approach to @xmath18 was finally realized with the discovery of  at @xmath0 , and spectroscopic observations of its afterglow .",

    "we find that the host is a @xmath6 * , low mass , and modestly dusty starburst galaxy with a high specific star formation rate .",
    "combining these results with the absorption - line metallicity , we place the first point on the @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 diagrams of @xmath32 galaxies , and find that the evolution in these relations continues beyond @xmath17 .",

    "we processed the data using the multidrizzle routine @xcite in the stsdas package of iraf .",

    "the resulting images were then drizzled using pixfrac=0.7 and pixscale=0.5 , leading to a final pixel scale of @xmath38 pixel@xmath9 .",
    "astrometry was performed relative to a @xmath39-band image of the afterglow taken with the infrared telescope facility @xcite .",

    "we identify a single object coincident with the afterglow position at ( j2000 ) @xmath12= , @xmath41= ( @xmath42 south - east of the afterglow position ) ; see figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "no corresponding object is detected in the acs image .",
    "photometry of the object was performed using the zero - points of @xcite , resulting in @xmath43 mag ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 mag ( @xmath46 @xmath3jy ) .",
    "an extrapolation of the afterglow flux in the @xmath1-band to the time of our observation using the measured decay index of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ; @xcite ) , indicates an expected brightness @xmath49 mag , suggesting that about half of the detected flux is due to residual afterglow emission .",
    "we investigated this in more detail by modeling the surface brightness of the object using the galfit software @xcite with a point spread function generated with the tiny tim package .",
    "we use three models : ( i ) a point - source with @xmath50 mag appropriate for the predicted afterglow brightness , ( ii ) a point - source with the brightness as a free parameter , and ( iii ) a point - source with @xmath50 mag and an exponential disk with the brightness and scale length as free parameters .",
    "the results of the three fits are shown in figure  [ fig : galfit ] .",
    "we find that models ( i ) and ( ii ) , for which @xmath51 mag , leave significant residuals , indicating the presence of an extended source underlying the grb position . model ( iii ) , on the other hand , fully accounts for the observed surface brightness profile , resulting in a host galaxy brightness of @xmath52 mag and a scale length of @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the host galaxy contributes about @xmath54 of the flux at the time of our observations .      as part of the same program ( go20000 ) we also observed the field of  with the infrared array camera ( irac ;",

    "we used 100 s integrations with 72 medium scale dithers from the random cycling pattern for total on - source integration times of 7200 s at each passband .",
    "these nominal @xmath44 point source sensitivity limits are 0.26 , 0.49 , 3.3 and 4.2 @xmath3jy , respectively .",
    "starting with the s13.2.0 pipeline processed basic calibrated data ( bcd ) sets we corrected the individual frames for muxbleed and column pull down using software developed for the great observatories origins deep survey . due to the presence of bright stars in the field , many of the frames at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath3 m also showed evidence for `` muxstriping '' .",
    "this was removed using an additive correction on a column by column basis ( j.  surace , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "the processed bcd frames were then mosaicked together using the mopex routine @xcite and drizzled onto a @xmath55 grid .",
    "astrometry was performed relative to the hst / acs image using 70 common objects , resulting in an rms uncertainty of @xmath56 ( 3.6 @xmath3 m ) and @xmath57 ( 4.5 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "photometry at the position of the host galaxy was performed in fixed circular apertures of @xmath58 radius with appropriate beam size corrections applied as stated in the  observer s manual .",
    "the presence of brighter sources within @xmath59 of the host position required that we fit for the wings of the point spread function from those sources .",
    "we find a marginal detection of the host with @xmath60 @xmath3jy at 3.6 @xmath3 m , and @xmath44 upper limits of 0.4 @xmath3jy at 4.5 @xmath3 m , 2.7 @xmath3jy at 5.8 @xmath3 m , and 2.5 @xmath3jy at 8.0 @xmath3 m .",
    "with the observed afterglow spectral index , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ; @xcite ) , we find that the expected 3.6 @xmath3 m afterglow flux at the time of our observation is negligible , @xmath63 @xmath3jy .",
    "using the observed fluxes and upper limits ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) we now investigate the physical properties of the host galaxy .",
    "we begin by estimating the host extinction using ( i ) the difference between the observed and expected afterglow spectral indices , @xmath61 and @xmath64 , respectively @xcite , and ( ii ) the host uv slope ( the @xmath65-@xmath66 relation ; @xcite ) .",
    "the former approach indicates that for a @xcite extinction curve @xmath67 mag , or at the observed f160w and f850lp bandpasses , @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 mag . with the latter approach we find @xmath70 and hence @xmath71 mag , in rough agreement with the afterglow - based results ; here @xmath65 is defined such that @xmath72 .",
    "we note that the extinction estimates agree with the significant dust depletion inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum @xcite .    at the redshift of the host",
    "the observed 3.6 @xmath3 m band roughly traces the rest - frame optical @xmath73-band , leading to an extinction - corrected absolute magnitude , @xmath74 mag .",
    "the rest - frame uv magnitude , traced by the observed f160w band , is @xmath75 mag , or @xmath76 mag if we use the f850lp limit .",
    "these values correspond to a luminosity , @xmath77 * compared to the luminosity function of @xmath14 candidates in the hudf ( based on photometric redshifts alone ; @xcite ) , or about @xmath78 * when compared to the luminosity function of @xmath79 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the host of  is roughly an @xmath31 * galaxy .    the host star formation rate ( sfr )",
    "can be estimated from the measured uv luminosity and the conversion relation of @xcite .",
    "based on the f160w flux , we find @xmath80 erg s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 , or @xmath81",
    "m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 . the extinction - corrected rate is about @xmath82 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 using the value of @xmath83 inferred above .",
    "these values can be contrasted with the limit of @xmath84 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 inferred from the lack of detectable ly@xmath12 emission in the absorption spectrum of  @xcite . the discrepancy can be easily explained in terms of dust absorption of the ly@xmath12 photons , providing additional support to the significant extinction inferred from the afterglow spectral slope , the host uv spectral slope , and the depletion pattern .    incorporating the  data , we provide rough constraints on the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "given the low signal - to - noise we do not attempt real model fits , but instead we adopt a @xmath85 z@xmath8 , salpeter imf template from the @xcite library along with representative values of the mass , stellar population age , and extinction .",
    "an igm absorption model @xcite has also been incorporated in the sed .",
    "the models , shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , indicate that for @xmath86 mag , as inferred above , the stellar mass ranges from about @xmath87 to @xmath88 m@xmath8 as we vary the stellar population age from 20 to 100 myr and span the range of uncertainty in the @xmath2 @xmath3 m flux . for a larger extinction , @xmath89 mag and an age of 5 myr we find a mass of about @xmath90 m@xmath8 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the stellar mass is @xmath91 m@xmath8 , similar for example to the value derived for the @xmath92 galaxy hcm 6a @xcite , while the stellar population age is likely @xmath93 myr .",
    "finally , the inferred scale length for the host galaxy based on the galfit model presented in  [ sec : obs ] is @xmath94 kpc , consistent with the median value of about 2 kpc for grb host galaxies at @xmath95 @xcite , as well as with the median value of about 1 kpc for @xmath96-band drop - outs in the hudf @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we find that the host galaxy of  is an @xmath31 * starburst galaxy with a mass similar to that of the lmc , with interstellar gas enriched to about 0.05 z@xmath8 @xcite , and with appreciable dust depletion and extinction .",
    "is by far the highest redshift spectroscopically - confirmed burst observed to date , and its host is so far the only @xmath32 galaxy for which an estimate of the metallicity is available . given the relatively small number of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies at @xmath11 , it is instructive to compare the properties of a grb - selected galaxy to those selected through narrow - band ly@xmath12 imaging or the lyman drop - out technique . in figure",
    "[ fig : gals ] we compare some of the basic properties , which are available for the latter samples , namely the rest - frame absolute magnitudes and uv / ly@xmath12 star formation rates .",
    "we find that in the published sample , only 14 galaxies are located at higher redshift than the host of . in terms of uv luminosity , the host of  is fainter than about @xmath97 of all the known galaxies , and it has a star formation rate lower than about @xmath98 of all the galaxies .    on the other hand , we stress that the host of  would evade detection or confirmation in the current surveys since its ly@xmath12 line flux is very low , @xmath99 erg @xmath100 s@xmath9 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is most likely due to absorption by dust as inferred from the afterglow spectral index , the host uv slope , and dust depletion in the absorption spectrum . and",
    "yet the host of  is roughly an @xmath31 * galaxy with an appreciable star formation rate ( as evidenced by the uv luminosity and the occurrence of a grb ) and a substantial gas reservoir as inferred from the neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath35 .",
    "naturally , a much larger sample is required to accurately assess the relative contribution of similar galaxies to the star formation budget at @xmath14 , but it is clear that with the ability to measure redshifts independent of ly@xmath12 emission , grbs may provide the cleanest handle on obscured star formation at these redshifts .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of the metallicity , mass and luminosity of the host of  to those of lower redshift galaxies in an attempt to provide a first test of evolution in the @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 relations from @xmath101 to @xmath32 .",
    "first , we provide a note of caution that we are comparing a metallicity derived from absorption lines ( in this case [ s / h ] since sulfur is a non - refractory element ) to the oxygen abundance derived from emission lines using the @xmath102 and @xmath103 methods . in the case of quasar dlas",
    "metallicities a nearly 1 dex discrepancy has been noted compared to emission line metallicities . however , unlike quasar sight lines which preferentially probe halo gas , grb sight lines probe star forming regions , much like emission lines diagnostics . this is supported by observations of systematically higher metallicities as a function of redshift for grb - dlas compared to qso - dlas @xcite .",
    "thus , the comparison to emission line metallicities is most likely robust , and the only remaining caveat is that the inferred metallicity potentially represents the star forming region local to the grb , and not the average metallicity of all regions in the galaxy . in the absence of additional information , we take the inferred metallicity of @xmath104}=-1.3\\pm 0.3 $ ] to be representative .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mlz ] we plot the metallicity of the host of versus luminosity and stellar mass as inferred in  [ sec : prop ] .",
    "for comparison we plot the same data for @xmath105 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , @xmath106 galaxies from the gemini deep deep survey , the canada - france redshift survey , and the team keck redshift survey @xcite , @xmath107 galaxies from the deep2 survey @xcite , and @xmath108 uv - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "as noted by the aforementioned authors , there is clear evolution in both the @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 relations in the sense that galaxies of a given mass / luminosity have lower metallicities at progressively higher redshifts .",
    "the implications of this evolution , and of the @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 relations themselves , are a matter of current investigation , and here we simply note that the host of  indicates that this trend likely continues to much higher redshifts .",
    "specifically , for galaxies of a similar brightness to the host of  the mean metallicity evolves from @xmath109 z@xmath8 at @xmath110 to @xmath111 z@xmath8 at @xmath112 and @xmath113 z@xmath8 at @xmath108 .",
    "a similar trend is observed with mass .",
    "the host of , with @xmath114 z@xmath8 continues this trend .",
    "in fact , the data for  are in good agreement with the empirical time evolution model of the @xmath29-@xmath30 relation derived by @xcite , which indicates that for @xmath115 the expected metallicity at @xmath116 is about @xmath117 z@xmath8 .",
    "the detection of additional grbs at @xmath14 will allow us to examine in detail whether the @xmath29-@xmath30 and @xmath31-@xmath30 relations actually exist at those redshifts , and if they in fact follow the evolutionary trend observed at lower redshifts . moreover , with the ability to probe galactic - scale outflows in absorption",
    ", we can determine whether the origin of these relations is rooted in higher gas fractions for lower mass galaxies , or outflows from their shallower potential wells  a matter of current debate @xcite .",
    "this applies to the growing sample of grb absorption spectra at @xmath33 as well , which can both fill in the gap from @xmath17 to @xmath14 , and through near - ir spectroscopy of the host galaxies allow us to compare emission- and absorption - derived metallicities at @xmath118 , and directly assess the existence of any systematic differences .",
    "we conclude by noting that grb selection of @xmath14 galaxies is roughly as efficient as other techniques :  required about 6 hr for the afterglow identification and spectroscopy @xcite , and 6 hst orbits , compared to an average of @xmath119 hr of large telescope time to locate and confirm a @xmath120 galaxy in other surveys @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in this paper , the real power of grb selection lies in the relative ease of redshift determination and the reduced influence of dust compared to the reliance on faint ly@xmath12 emission , and even more importantly the ability to measure metallicities ( and at high spectral resolution , kinematics ) . with this in mind",
    ", we suggest that along with the development of future @xmath121 m ground - based telescopes and _ jwst _ , a next - generation grb mission with higher sensitivity and all - sky coverage , coupled with dedicated near - ir imaging and spectroscopy follow - up from the ground , may provide a complementary window into the evolution and metallicity of the first stars and galaxies .",
