    "magnetic field of stars , planets and other astrophysical objects is often attributed to the motion of electrically conducting melted substance in their interior ( parker , 1979 ; priest , 1984 ; soward , 2005 ; hughes , 2007 ; dormy and soward 2007 ) , which is usually sustained by compositional and thermal convection .",
    "convective flows in a plane layer , ranging from very simple ( matthews , 1999 ) to turbulent ( meneguzzi and pouquet , 1989 ; cattaneo  2003 ) ones , are capable of magnetic field generation . in simulations of the dynamo in the earth",
    "s liquid core ( glatzmaier and roberts , 1995 ; roberts and glatzmaier , 2000 ) , a magnetic field of the approximately correct strength was produced , which had the dipole structure and exhibited reversals similar to the natural ones .",
    "dynamos in spherical shells were also simulated by grote and busse ( 2001 ) , ishinara and kida ( 2002 ) , takahashi and matsushima ( 2005 ) and other authors .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic thermal convection is characterised in the dimensionless form by the rayleigh number , @xmath0 ( indicating the magnitude of thermal buoyancy forces ) ; the prandtl number , @xmath1 ( the ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity ) , the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath2 ( the ratio of kinematic viscosity to magnetic diffusivity ) , and the taylor number , @xmath3 ( measuring the speed of rotation ) . usually no - slip or stress - free boundary conditions for the flow velocity and perfectly conducting or insulating boundaries for magnetic field are considered .    how magnetic field generation by convection depends on parameter values ,",
    "is not yet explored in full .",
    "large rayleigh numbers are beneficial for generation ( the critical @xmath2 decreases monotonically with the increasing @xmath0 ) in spherical shells ( busse , 2000 ) .",
    "podvigina ( 2006 ) found a similar dependence in plane layer dynamos on increasing @xmath0 over the critical value , but for @xmath0 over a certain threshold the behaviour of the critical @xmath2 ceased to be monotonic ; podvigina ( 2008 ) also examined the influence of the prandtl number .",
    "rotation , which is a common feature of the majority of astrophysical bodies , can also assist magnetic field generation .",
    "rotation of the earth is relatively rapid ; it is believed , that geodynamo operates in the outer core in the magnetostrophic regime , in which the strength of the coriolis force is comparable to that of other primary forces - the lorentz force , pressure and buoyancy .",
    "rotation is also an important factor in physics of the solar tachocline ( christensen - dalsgaard and thompson , 2007 ) , where apparently the solar dynamo is located .",
    "differential rotation gives rise to @xmath4effect dynamos ( moffatt , 1978 ) .",
    "although they are slow , as opposed to fast ones , which are believed to operate in stars , this mechanism is regarded as a key element of the dynamo of the sun ( tobias and weiss , 2007 ) .",
    "boundary layers and shear flows developing in rapidly rotating fluids are the structures controlling the dynamics of fluid and planetary dynamo processes ( busse , 2007 ) . therefore , how the processes of generation are affected by the rate of rotation is an interesting question for astrophysical applications .",
    "dependence of magnetic field generation on the rate of rotation was explored in a number of papers .",
    "meneguzzi and pouquet ( 1989 ) observed that rotation could be beneficial for nonlinear dynamos  the critical magnetic reynolds number decreased and the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energies significantly increased , when rotation was on . by contrast , cattaneo and hughes ( 2006 ) found that rotation was not a significant factor : they reported `` similar growth rates and similar saturation levels '' in rotating and non - rotating systems .",
    "only several runs were presented in each of the two papers , and hence the observations were inconclusive . whilst turbulent convective nonlinear dynamos do not require rotation , near",
    "the onset of convection in a plane layer rotation is essential for both kinematic ( matthews , 1999 ) and nonlinear dynamo action ( demircan and seehafer , 2002 )  in both regimes considered by these authors dynamos failed in the absence of rotation .",
    "our paper is devoted to investigation of the dependence of magnetic field generation on @xmath3 .",
    "a fluid heated from below in a plane horizontal layer rotating about the vertical axis is considered in the boussinesq approximation , whereby the buoyancy depends linearly on temperature , density variation is neglected in the mass conservation equation and the flow is incompressible .",
    "perfectly electrically conducting stress - free horizontal boundaries of the layer are held at constant temperatures ; periodicity in horizontal directions with the same period @xmath5 ( measured in the units of the layer depth ) is assumed .",
    "we fix all parameter values except for the taylor number and investigate numerically attractors of the system for @xmath3 increasing from zero , and bifurcations delimiting branches of the attractors . along the branches we trace average magnetic , @xmath6 , and kinetic , @xmath7 , energies , as well as their ratio , @xmath8 , in saturated regimes ; the latter quantity is a measure of dynamo efficiency of prime concern in astrophysics ( although we are clearly not in the astrophysical range of parameter values ) .",
    "the system is also of interest from the point of view of equivariant bifurcation theory , because it has a large symmetry group .    which parameter values are optimal for such an investigation ? naturally , we need to employ the values , for which the structure of attractors of the dynamical system and the geometry of their branches in the parameter space are relatively simple .",
    "behaviour of the dynamical system , which one encounters in the geo- and astrophysical environments or in experimental dynamos , results from a large number of bifurcations of the trivial steady state , and it is prohibitively complex to serve as a starting point for such a study .",
    "these difficult cases can be approached later by continuation in parameters starting at the regimes determined in the initial study .",
    "also , in the initial investigation we can not employ relatively small values of @xmath2 , because for them only vigorous turbulent flows would yield magnetic dynamos : many hydrodynamic bifurcations would be required to bring the convective mhd system into the turbulent state and , consequently , for such parameter values the system will also be prohibitively complex . by contrast , for relatively large @xmath2 already laminar convective flows of simple structure can act as dynamos ; moreover , if @xmath2 is not too large , magnetic field will not be too strong to enable the lorentz force to destabilise the convective flows .",
    "this suits ideally our purposes .    following these considerations",
    ", we employed the same values as in podvigina ( 2006 ) : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the rayleigh number is not far from the critical value for the onset of convection ; hence , convective attractors have a simple roll structure , which simplifies a detailed investigation of the attractors and bifurcations .",
    "the @xmath2 value is not far from its critical values for the kinematic dynamo problem for convective attractors , hence flows in convective mhd attractors ( when dynamos operate ) are qualitatively similar to flows in non - magnetic ones .",
    "( note , that in steady mhd states flows can be reconstructed from the structure of the generated magnetic field , see zheligovsky , 2009a . )",
    "the assumed aspect ratio , @xmath5 , is equal to the spatial period ( measured in the units of the layer width ) of the hydrodynamic mode becoming unstable the first when the onset of convective motion occurs in a non - rotating layer on increasing the rayleigh number .",
    "although these values are chosen on the basis of mathematical convenience , they are not unphysical : @xmath2 are of the order of unity in accretion disks ( von rekowski , 2001 ) ; magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath2 in excess of unity are typical for intergalactic and interstellar gases ( shukurov and sokoloff , 2008 ; see also table  1 in brandenburg and subramanian , 2005 ) . a plasma experiment for the study of astrophysical dynamos , where @xmath13 , was proposed by spence(2009 ) .",
    "we also note that typically galaxies are thin disks ( see ruzmaikin , 1988 ) , and hence some features of the problem at hand ( an infinite plane layer with stress - free boundaries ) are appropriate to model galactic dynamos .",
    "we stress nevertheless , that we solve the problem in an abstract setting and do not pretend to simulate any specific physical system .",
    "the system is governed by the navier - stokes equation @xmath14 the magnetic induction equation @xmath15 for solenoidal fields @xmath16 and the heat transfer equation @xmath17 here @xmath18 denotes the flow velocity , @xmath19 the magnetic field , @xmath20 the difference between the temperature of fluid and the linear temperature profile , and @xmath21 is twice the angular speed of rotation of the fluid .    the following boundary conditions on the horizontal boundaries : @xmath22 @xmath23 and periodicity in horizontal directions with the same period @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 are assumed .",
    "the equations are solved numerically by the standard pseudospectral methods ( boyd , 2001 ; peyret , 2002 ) .",
    "fields are represented as fourier series satisfying the boundary conditions ( 2 ) : @xmath27*v*=_*n * (    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      as noted in section 3 , tw bifurcates supercritically in a hopf bifurcation from r@xmath28 as @xmath3 decreases below 188 .",
    "for the employed value of @xmath2 , at the point of bifurcation r@xmath28 generates magnetic field kinematically .",
    "the respective magnetic eigenvalue is real and not large , hence attractors observed for @xmath3 not far from 188 can be related to interaction of two instability modes of r@xmath28 , hydrodynamic and magnetic ones .",
    "the symmetry group of r@xmath28 is generated by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the hydrodynamic eigenspace",
    "the symmetries @xmath29 and @xmath31 act non - trivially , and in the magnetic eigenspace the action of the symmetries @xmath29 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 is non - trivial . hence , the results of golubitsky  ( 1988 ) ( section xx  2 ) on hopf / steady - state mode interaction with the * o*(2 ) symmetry group are applicable .",
    "( the symmetry @xmath32 plays no rle , since , in the notation _",
    "ibid_. , @xmath33 is a superposition of two shifts , in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are elements of * so*(2 ) and @xmath36 , respectively . in our problem ,",
    "the action of * so*(2 ) is generated by the shifts @xmath31 along the direction of the rolls . ) according to golubitsky  ( 1988 ) , the trivial steady state ( r@xmath28 in our case ) bifurcates with emergence of an @xmath29-symmetric steady state , when a real eigenvalue becomes positive , and with a simultaneous emergence of rotating ( i.e. travelling , in our parlance ) , tw , and standing waves , sw , when a complex pair of eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis .",
    "the rotating wave can further bifurcate to a modulated rotating wave ( which in fact is a 2-torus ) .    in our system , in agreement with this general theory , r@xmath28 bifurcates to tw ( in the hydrodynamic subspace ) and to s@xmath37 .",
    "tw further bifurcates to a modulated travelling wave , p@xmath38 ( which we classify as a periodic orbit , since we omit drift frequencies in the description of attractors ) . at @xmath39",
    "the bifurcation where p@xmath38 emerges is subcritical , and close to the point of bifurcation the periodic orbit is unstable .",
    "it gains stability as it turns back in a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath40 .",
    "we classify the stable periodic orbit observed in computations as the modulated rotating wave predicted by the theory , because 1 ) of the similarity of the spatial structure of tw and the flow in p@xmath38 , as well as of the dominant magnetic mode of tw and magnetic field in p@xmath38 ; 2 ) the symmetry group of p@xmath38 is the one expected on the theoretical grounds for the branch emerging at @xmath39 from tw due to the mode interaction ( note that it includes a spatio - temporal symmetry : the symmetry about a vertical axis with a shift in time by a half of a period ) ; and 3 ) the temporal frequency of p@xmath38 is close to the hopf frequency of tw .",
    "the steady state s@xmath37 bifurcates as @xmath3 is decreased to a less symmetric steady state s@xmath41 , which is outside the hopf / steady - state mode interaction center manifold . as @xmath3 is decreased further , s@xmath41 becomes unstable in a hopf bifurcation with a stable periodic orbit emerging .",
    "we label it p@xmath42 , because its spatial structure and temporal frequency are similar to those of the unstable standing wave sw emerging from r@xmath28 simultaneously with the travelling wave tw , and its symmetry group is a subgroup of the one of sw .",
    "the general theory of hopf / steady - state mode interaction predicts two types of periodic orbits bifurcating from sw , but judging by its symmetries none of them is our p@xmath42 . the conjectured relation of p@xmath42 with sw is shown by thin dashed lines on .      both periodic orbits ,",
    "p@xmath38 and p@xmath42 , give rise to complex families of attractors , f@xmath44 and c@xmath42 , discussed in this subsection ( see table  [ tab : qtw ] ) .",
    "like p@xmath45 , all attractors constituting f@xmath44 drift along both horizontal axes and thus have two drift frequencies .",
    "the family f@xmath44 starts from the primary periodic mhd attractor p@xmath38 at @xmath40 .",
    "as @xmath3 is increased beyond @xmath46 , the second frequency , @xmath47 , appears in a hopf bifurcation , i.e. a stable torus emerges .",
    "afterwards , a sequence of bifurcations of halving of @xmath47 takes place ( often such a sequence is called a cascade of period doubling bifurcations for a torus ; we prefer to abstain from the use of this terminology , since the concept of a period applied to a torus is not all too transparent ) .",
    "this sequence of bifurcations is analogous to the feigenbaum ( 1978 ) scenario of period doublings for a logistic map , and we label this family of attractors by f.    logistic map is defined by the recurrent relation @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 is increased over 3 , a stable 2-cycle is created in a flip bifurcation .",
    "subsequent flip bifurcations result in emergence of cycles of lengths 4 , 8 , @xmath51 .",
    "the bifurcations accumulate at @xmath52 . for larger @xmath50 ,",
    "chaotic behaviour sets in , alternating with windows of periodic orbits of periods @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , @xmath55 escapes from the interval @xmath49 and diverges .",
    "( a)(b )    ( c)(d )    ( e)(f )    ( g)(h )    in the convective hydromagnetic system , on increasing @xmath3 we have detected three halvings of the frequency @xmath56 , followed by a chaotic behaviour . for larger @xmath3 , lower basic frequencies set in , @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 ; their appearance agrees with the general theory .",
    "no more halvings have been observed .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a complete sequence of period doubling bifurcations of tori is a structurally unstable scenario ( see coullet , 1984 ) , and generically it is interrupted by the onset of chaos .",
    "( we could also miss some halvings just having considered not enough values of @xmath3 . ) for still larger @xmath3 , a frequency @xmath61 is observed . on the one hand ,",
    "emergence of this quasiperiodic regime is clearly outside the framework of the feigenbaum period doubling scenario ( cf .",
    "( b ) and ( h ) ) , suggesting that attractors for @xmath62 do not belong to our feigenbaum family . on the other ,",
    "the standard theory takes into account only two first terms in the taylor expansion of the dynamical system on the central manifold , and terms of higher order may be responsible for the birth of this new regime .",
    "( a)(b)(c )    ( d)(e)(f )    ( g)(h )    ( a)(b)(c )    ( d)(e)(f )    ( g)(h )    plots of the energies ( ) , not affected by drift frequencies , clearly display the frequency halving .",
    "by contrast , plots of the time dependencies of real or imaginary parts of individual fourier coefficients ( not shown ) are marred by the extra drift frequencies , making these plots by far more obscure .",
    "a similar effect is observed in poincar sections .",
    "frequency halving for tori usually shows itself unambiguously on poincar sections , however , the standard poincar sections are not particularly enlightening when additional drift frequencies are present .",
    "their influence is eliminated in poincar sections , which are constructed with the use of absolute values of fourier coefficients ( cf . figs .  [",
    "fig : poincare ] and [ fig : poincare_abs ] ) .",
    "the family c@xmath42 exists for @xmath63 .",
    "it is comprised of chaotic attractors , alternating with windows of periodic and quasiperiodic regimes ( ) .",
    "the family starts with the periodic regime p@xmath42 , which is stable for @xmath64 .",
    "the orbit possesses a symmetry , which is a combination of @xmath29 with a shift by a half of its temporal period , hence , in agreement with krupa ( 1990 ) , the periodic orbit does not drift .",
    "as @xmath3 is decreased , the symmetry is lost , the emerging non - symmetric orbit and subsequent attractors of the family have two drifting frequencies ( not discussed here ) .",
    "subsequently , a second frequency appears in a hopf bifurcation , which is halved afterwards . on a further decrease of @xmath3",
    ", we observe an intermittency of chaotic and quasiperiodic attractors .",
    "the sequence `` a periodic orbit , a torus , chaos '' is standard ; it is usually explained by appearance of the third basic frequency , which makes the system structurally unstable and results in the onset of a chaotic behaviour ( ruelle and takens , 1971 ) .",
    "the observed windows of quasiperiodicity can be attributed to frequency locking ( see , e.g. , ott , 2002 ) .",
    "notably , coexistence of attractors of different types is observed : two types of mhd attractors ( f@xmath44 and p@xmath45 ) in the interval @xmath65 , and a ( magnetically stable ) hydrodynamic attractor ( tw ) with an mhd attractor ( c@xmath42 ) in the interval @xmath66 .",
    "coexistence of a hydrodynamic and mhd attractors can be described in physical terms , as _ stiff excitation _ of a magnetic field : _ small _ magnetic perturbations of tw decay to the hydrodynamic state , while _ large _ magnetic perturbations give rise to mhd regimes .",
    "furthermore , in the interval @xmath67 three mhd attractors coexist : p@xmath45 , f@xmath44 and c@xmath42 . from the point of view of the theory of dynamical systems",
    "there is nothing extraordinary in coexistence of attractors in a nonlinear system , however , to the best of our knowledge coexistence of three convective mhd attractors was never observed before .",
    "( a)(b)(c )    ( d)(e)(f )      dominant magnetic modes of r@xmath28 are of the same type for all @xmath3 . as attested by symmetries ,",
    "the primary mhd attractor is the steady state s@xmath37 detaching from r@xmath28 at @xmath70 in a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "it exists ( i.e. the mhd states are stable ) for @xmath71 . on decreasing @xmath3 , a steady state s@xmath41 with a smaller group of symmetries emanates in a pitchfork bifurcation ; it becomes unstable and bifurcates to p@xmath38 in a hopf bifurcation .    on increasing @xmath3 , in a small interval @xmath72 four bifurcations occurring in the vicinity of s@xmath37 ( in the phase space ) are observed ( see ( b ) ) .",
    "they take place in two distinct invariant subspaces , fix(@xmath73 ) and fix(@xmath29 ) ( fix(@xmath74 ) denotes the set of fixed points under the action of a symmetry @xmath74 ) .",
    "developments in each invariant subspace are mutually independent ( see a sketch of geometry of the phase space shown on ; the vertical plane represents fix(@xmath73 ) and the horizontal one fix(@xmath29 ) ) .",
    "the first ( on increasing @xmath3 ) one is a hopf bifurcation in fix(@xmath73 ) at @xmath75 , in which a periodic orbit , p@xmath41 , emanates .",
    "another one is a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath76 in the same invariant subspace , in which a branch of steady states , s@xmath77 , terminates . near the point of bifurcation",
    "the basin of attraction of the steady states becomes vanishingly small , requiring short steps when continuing the branch in @xmath3 so that computed trajectories were not attracted by p@xmath41 .",
    "on decreasing @xmath3 from , say , 224 , eigenvalues of stability modes are in the beginning imaginary , but both the real and imaginary parts decrease in magnitude , apparently tending to zero . at @xmath78 , @xmath79 ,",
    "the discriminant of the quadratic characteristic equation , defining the two eigenvalues , changes its sign . as a result ,",
    "the dominant eigenvalue exhibits a counterintuitive behaviour : coefficients of the characteristic equation depend almost linearly on @xmath3 near this value @xmath80 , but the change of sign of the discriminant implies , that the dominant real eigenvalue is continuous , but non - smooth ( see ) .",
    "the graph of the growth rate of the dominant mode bends at @xmath80 and for @xmath81 behaves like @xmath82 .",
    "the largest real eigenvalue starts to grow much faster , and a saddle - node bifurcation occurs between @xmath83 and 223.1 .",
    "an almost simultaneous vanishing of both real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues implies , that two parameters are necessary to describe this bifurcation , i.e. we are in a vicinity of a codimension two bifurcation .",
    "variation of @xmath3 near the left end of the branch s@xmath77 is equivalent to a motion along an one - dimensional curve on the plane of the parameters .",
    "vanishing of a pair of complex eigenvalues of linearisation of a dynamical system is an attribute of the takens - bogdanov bifurcation ( see guckenheimer and holmes , 1988 ) .",
    "there are further indications that the bifurcation occurring in fix(@xmath73 ) close ( in the parameter space ) to the values , which are fixed in our simulations , might be a takens - bogdanov bifurcation : in this interval , @xmath72 , a periodic orbit emerges and afterwards becomes unstable or disappears and a steady state emerges , and they are close neighbours in the same symmetric subspace .",
    "however , a more attentive inspection of the system convinces that this conjecture is wrong",
    ".    only s@xmath37 might be the trivial steady state suffering the bifurcation ( although the behaviour of the eigenvalues reminiscent of the takens - bogdanov bifurcation is registered for s@xmath77 , this branch turns back in a saddle - node bifurcation and thus can not serve as the trivial steady state , existing in the case of takens - bogdanov bifurcation for all parameter values in the vicinity of the point of bifurcation ) .",
    "it is quite possible that a pair of complex eigenvalues of linearisation of s@xmath37 simultaneously become zero upon a variation of @xmath3 and a second parameter : s@xmath37 does have small in magnitude complex eigenvalues in the interval @xmath84 for the parameter values that we have employed ; also it is not far from s@xmath77 , suggestive of a similar behaviour of eigenvalues of the two branches .",
    "the structure of our system is compatible only with the takens - bogdanov bifurcation ( with the @xmath85 symmetry group generated by @xmath29 , which s@xmath77 does not possess ) involving a stable periodic orbit and stable steady states , distinct from the trivial one ; such a diagram is shown on figs .",
    "7.3.7 and 7.3.9 _ ibid .",
    "_ on these figures , the trivial steady state ( the analogue of s@xmath37 ) is stable for @xmath86 ( using the parameter notation _ ibid . _ ) , the other two steady states ( the analogues of s@xmath77 and its symmetric counterpart ) for @xmath87 , and a periodic orbit for @xmath88 . hence variation of @xmath3 on the interval @xmath89 must be equivalent to a motion along a curve on the @xmath90 plane , beginning in the quadrant @xmath86 , following to the quadrant @xmath91 , and passing to the region @xmath92 .",
    "consequently , the curve must cross the line @xmath93 , where in the takens - bogdanov bifurcation a branch of steady states ( analogues of s@xmath77 ) , stable or unstable depending on the sign of @xmath94 , emanates from the trivial steady state in a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "this is inconsistent with the behaviour of eigenvalues of linearisation of s@xmath37 ( we have computed these unstable steady states after the hopf bifurcation , giving rise to p@xmath41 , by imposing the symmetries @xmath30 and @xmath29 )  the dominant and subdominant eigenvalues do become real between @xmath95 and 221.5 , but they remain positive and do not become small on the interval @xmath96 . therefore we conclude , that bifurcations in our system are not induced by a takens - bogdanov bifurcation ( a finite perturbation of a bifurcation of this type , in which more than two parameters are essential for the description of the bifurcation , is not ruled out ) .",

    "we have found numerically that @xmath139 possesses two types of dominant magnetic modes ( see table  [ tab : conv_lambda ] and ) . in the interval of @xmath3 where @xmath139 exists there are two windows of kinematic dynamo action , resulting in two intervals of nonlinear dynamos ; the lower one is @xmath141 .",
    "the first ( on increasing @xmath3 ) attractor s@xmath142 is primary , but it is related to a subdominant magnetic mode .",
    "the mode has the same spatial structure as the respective nonlinear steady state displayed on ( k ) .",

    "the associated eigenvalue is real and positive for @xmath145 , the maximum is 0.1 .",
    "another primary mhd attractor is s@xmath146 bifurcating from rd in a pitchfork bifurcation when the respective eigenvalue of the kinematic dynamo problem crosses the imaginary axis .",
    "the two branches of primary steady states are connected by the branch s@xmath147 , with a smaller symmetry group ( cf .",
    "( k ) , ( l ) , ( m ) ) .",
    "the third primary branch emanating from @xmath139 , the steady state s@xmath149 , is always stable when exists .",
    "both ends of the branch terminate on @xmath139 at @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "our results demonstrate that the influence of rotation on magnetic field generation by thermal convection is non - monotonic and in no way simple .",
    "its nature can only be understood by a careful investigation of attractors of the underlying dynamical system and bifurcations of branches of convective mhd regimes .",
    "such an investigation is made more exciting by the presence of a large group of symmetries of the dynamical system .",
    "even close to the critical point for the onset of convective motion , in the terms of the taylor number , the bifurcation diagram is quite complex .",
    "there are several intervals of coexistence of two or three convective mhd attractors ( also sometimes with a non - generating hydrodynamic one ) .    an overall picture that we have obtained fits well the usual beliefs , that up to a point an increase of the rate of rotation from zero benefits magnetic field generation both in linear and nonlinear regimes , and after attaining a maximum of the mean magnetic energy ( in our simulations , @xmath152 in the regime s@xmath37 for @xmath153 ) on a further increase of the rotation rate @xmath6 gradually falls off till magnetic field generation ceases , and at still higher angular velocities the fluid flow is arrested .",
    "however , the presence of many individual branches and windows of nonlinear dynamo action ( e.g. , between the mhd steady states s@xmath146 and s@xmath149 ) adds a rich `` small - scale structure '' to this otherwise `` smooth '' general picture , on some intervals of @xmath3 even reversing it .",
    "for instance , an increase of the rate of rotation from zero inhibits magnetic field generation in the periodic regime p@xmath44 , rather than enhances it .",
    "apparently the conjecture , that increasing the taylor number first helps , afterwards hinders and finally halts magnetic field generation , has not yet been proved , but it appears to be correct for all parameter values ( provided the rayleigh number is sufficiently large ) . in the absence of magnetic field the critical rayleigh number for the onset of convection grows with the taylor number ( see chandrasekhar , 1961 ) ; thus , in the hydrodynamic case fast rotation is guaranteed to arrest convective flows .",
    "if a magnetic field is present , the system is more complex and various phenomena  such as subcritical loss of stability of the basic state with the fluid at rest  are not ruled out for sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields ; this can result in extension of the interval of the taylor number , for which convective mhd states persist for the given other parameter values .",
    "however , it is unlikely that this interval becomes infinite even for @xmath154 , since  in physical terms  magnetic field generation relies on advection by the fluid , and not vice versa .",
    "this question awaits further investigation .",
    "we have observed a number of interesting bifurcations . to the best of our knowledge , two global bifurcations",
    "were not observed before .",
    "they are similar to the snic ( saddle - node on invariant circle ) bifurcation , and their peculiarity stems from the presence of a non - trivial symmetry group in the convective mhd system . in these bifurcations , at @xmath155 and @xmath156 , a periodic orbit terminates not on a homoclinic ( as in the snic ) , but a heteroclinic cycle , whose existence relies on the presence of the symmetry group . among more common , albeit rather seldom observed in natural systems families , that we have encountered , an incomplete feigenbaum sequence of `` period doubling bifurcations of a torus '' , f@xmath44 ( occurring between @xmath157 and 80 ) is notable , as well as an intermittent sequence of chaotic and quasiperiodic regimes , c@xmath42 ( occurring for @xmath63 ) , in which existence of the quasiperiodic regimes can be apparently linked with frequency locking .",
    "another unusual set of bifurcations observed on the interval @xmath72 is associated with a pair of complex eigenvalues of the linearisation of the dynamical system , which are simultaneously vanishing .",
    "numerical examination of eigenvalues of the supposed trivial steady state s@xmath37 suggests that the observed bifurcations in our convective mhd system are not linked with a takens - bogdanov bifurcation occurring for nearby parameter values , but we do not rule out a finite perturbation of a bifurcation of this type .",
    "we plan to perform a further investigation of the bifurcation in order to gain a mathematical understanding of its nature .",
    "we have found a number of branches of mhd steady states , which are parity - invariant ( i.e. have the symmetry @xmath73 ) or possessing the symmetry about a vertical axis , @xmath29 .",
    "certain periodic orbits ( @xmath157 , the family f@xmath44 ; @xmath158 , the family c@xmath42 ; @xmath159 , branch p@xmath41 ) are not pointwise symmetric , but symmetric on average , i.e. the symmetry with a time shift by a half of temporal period is present .",
    "possession of such a symmetry is an important property of attractors , since in convective mhd systems with this symmetry the global @xmath160effect is zero .",
    "whilst in the presence of the global @xmath160effect the system is inherently unstable to large - scale perturbations , in its absence the instability , when present , develops on time scales of a larger order . in the latter case",
    "it is described by a highly complex nonlinear mixed system of pde s of the second and third order ( see zheligovsky , 2009b ) , incorporating such physical effects , as combined eddy diffusivity and eddy advection .",
    "we are planning to follow this line of research .",
    "for the chosen values of the rayleigh and magnetic prandtl numbers , which are not particularly high , the convective system is not far from the onset of convection and magnetic field generation , and the collection of hydrodynamic and magnetic structures that we encounter is not rich ( in the mhd regimes the flows take the form of perturbed rolls , and magnetic field concentrates in half - ropes located near the boundaries ) .",
    "more complex structures are produced in a more vigorous convection for higher values of the rayleigh and the magnetic prandtl numbers .",
    "a natural extension of our investigation consists of continuation of branches of regimes , that we have found , in other parameters , which would significantly contribute for gaining an insight into the mathematics and physics of convective dynamos ( i.e. , of the geometry of branches of attractors in the parameter space ) .",
    "this project is , obviously , quite resource demanding , but in our opinion this approach is more promising for the deeper understanding of convective mhd systems , than analysis of individual runs for extreme parameter values .",
