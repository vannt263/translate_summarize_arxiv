    "the famous lacunary fourier series @xmath13 was proposed by riemann in the 1850 s as an example of continuous but nowhere differentiable function . since then , this series has drawn much attention from many mathematicians ( amongst them , hardy and littlewood ) , and its complete local study was finally achieved by gerver in @xcite and jaffard in @xcite . in particular , its local regularity at a point @xmath14 depends on the diophantine type of @xmath14 , and it is differentiable only at rationals @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are both odd .    in this article , we study the series defined for @xmath18 and @xmath19 by @xmath20 and we denote by @xmath21 its @xmath22-th partial sum . both are periodic functions of period @xmath23 in @xmath14 and @xmath24 in @xmath25 . for @xmath26 and @xmath27",
