    "hence , if @xmath875 ( namely , @xmath876 ) with @xmath877 large enough , a proper choice of @xmath868 ( sufficiently small ) ensures that @xmath869 does not leave the interval @xmath870 as @xmath878 . still from one deduces that @xmath879 for suitable constants @xmath880 and @xmath881 . the choice of @xmath303 above and imply that , for @xmath882 large enough ( again , greater or equal than a given value @xmath211 that depends only on @xmath18 ) , there holds @xmath883 @xmath884 being another positive constant . gathering all this information , let us go back to equation .",
    "first , from the global harnack principle and from , one deduces that @xmath885 that does not depend on @xmath886",
    ". moreover , notice that @xmath887 hence , , and the inequality @xmath888 which can be proved as above , give @xmath889 again for positive constants @xmath890 and @xmath891 that do not depend on @xmath886 . the bounds and permit to conclude , as in the proofs of theorem 1.1 and lemmas 3.1 - 3.2 of @xcite ( one uses the regularity results of @xcite and @xcite for bounded solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations like ) , that the following estimates hold : @xmath892 @xmath893 and @xmath894 being suitable positive constants depending only on @xmath895 , @xmath303 , @xmath7 , @xmath36 and @xmath18 . going back to the original variables , we end up with the existence of positive constants @xmath896 , @xmath897 such that @xmath898 in order to prove - in the region @xmath899 one just uses , , and the equality @xmath900 recursively .",
    "to extend such bounds to @xmath901 it is enough to apply the aforementioned regularity results to @xmath148 directly , since in this region @xmath148 is bounded away from zero .",
    "finally , they also hold for @xmath902 up to admitting dependence of the constants @xmath903 on @xmath304 as well through @xmath303 and @xmath895 ( as a consequence of the global harnack principle ) .    using the fact that the solution @xmath368 to and any of its derivatives @xmath904 behave like @xmath905 at infinity ( recall and see formula below ) , it is only a matter of tedious computations to check that estimates imply that @xmath906 ( up to possibly different constants that we keep denoting as @xmath907 ) , where @xmath68 is the relative error @xmath908 ( notice that it is different from the relative error @xmath224 we dealt with in section [ sec : rel ] ) . by exploiting the interpolation inequalities ( we refer to @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for a short review on general interpolation inequalities ) @xmath909 the bounds and ( that is , the fact that @xmath910 as @xmath779 ) , we conclude that also @xmath911 recalling , this is equivalent to formula of theorem [ thconvrel ] . as for estimates - of theorem [ corharnack ] , just notice that they can be readily deduced from - and again .",
    "finally , let us investigate what means in terms of spatial derivatives for @xmath148 ( or @xmath13 ) .",
    "that is , we are going to prove formula of theorem [ thconvrel ] .",
    "first of all we show , by induction , that @xmath912 indeed , the existence of the limit in is a consequence of the chain rule and .",
    "then , suppose that holds for a given @xmath271 .",
    "consider the limit @xmath913 since the limit on the r.h.s .  of exists , by de lhpital s theorem it coincides with @xmath914 this proves the inductive step . because is trivially valid for @xmath915",
    ", we conclude that it holds for all @xmath56 .",
    "now recall that , for the @xmath271-th spatial derivative of @xmath68 , one has the binomial formula @xmath916 where , to simplify notation , we use apexes to denote derivatives w.r.t .",
    "we are going to show that , for all @xmath56 , the ratio @xmath917 converges in @xmath729 to a smooth function @xmath918 such that @xmath919 this is clearly equivalent to proving .",
    "for @xmath915 is exactly , with the choice @xmath920 . for further derivatives we shall prove that holds by induction . indeed , suppose such result is true for all @xmath921 . from",
    "and we get @xmath922 thanks to the inductive step and , implies @xmath923 so , we are left with proving that the function @xmath924 complies with . from and",
    "the inductive hypothesis this will follow provided there holds @xmath925 an equality which is in fact true in view of the identity @xmath926 , valid by newton s binomial formula .",
    "[ oss : msottocritico ] in order to obtain the bounds - of theorem [ corsub ] ( subcritical @xmath36 ) , notice the quantities @xmath927 , @xmath928 appearing in can be taken to be continuous functions of @xmath929 , as a consequence of the method of proof of such inequality ( see sections [ sec : above ] and [ sec : below ] ) .",
    "this fact is sufficient to prove , as above , that there exists a constant @xmath895 ( now depending on @xmath350 too ) such that holds true .",
