    "a squeezed state is a generalized coherent state , which has a wide application in many branches of physics such as quantum optics , high energy physics , etc .",
    "recent years have witnessed a growing application of the squeezed state to the field of nonlinear dynamics and chaos @xcite .",
    "since the squeezed state approach is a kind of approximation of quantum mechanics , it is called a _ semiquantum approach _ by people in this community .",
    "the time evolution of expectation values and fluctuations of the squeezed state is thus named _ semiquantum dynamics _ , or _",
    "squeezed state dynamics_.    the main purpose of the squeezed state approach is to study how quantum fluctuations manifest themselves on classical trajectories .",
    "this approach starts directly from quantum systems with no reference to classical limit .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that the squeezed state dynamics exits even for systems without a well - defined classical dynamics .",
    "generally , the squeezed state approach simplifies the quantum version , and provides a complementary way to the semiclassical method .",
    "in some special cases ( unfortunately , we still do not know under what kind of conditions ) , it gives us better results than the semiclassical method@xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the semiclassical approach , the squeezed state approach is also a very useful tool to study the problem of classical - quantum correspondence .",
    "the squeezed state approach has proven to be very successful in studying dynamical systems ranging from integrable to many - body nonintegrable systems . among many others ,",
    "we name just a few examples here . in calculating the ground state energy for quantum system with potential @xmath0 , tsui@xcite discovered that the ground state energy obtained by the squeezed state approach is much closer to the exact ground state energy than that obtained from the wkb method .",
    "more recently , pattanayak and schieve@xcite applied this approach to a classically chaotic system , for which the wkb method completely fails .",
    "they have successfully calculated low - lying eigenenergies which agree within a few percent with the pure quantum ( numerical ) results .",
    "in addition to the ground state and/or lower excited state energies , the squeezed state approach can provide a way to obtain correct eigenfunctions .",
    "for instance , in applying the squeezed state approach to a harmonic oscillator , we can obtain not only the eigenenergies but also the eigenfunctions ( including the ground state ) exactly , as we shall see in appendix a , whereas the semiclassical method fails to yield the exact eigenfunctions . as a further example of many - body systems",
    ", we would like to mention that we have used the squeezed state approach to the one - dimensional quantum frenkel - kontoroval model@xcite , which is a nontrivial many - body , non - integrable system .",
    "our results show that the squeezed state approach very nicely captures the feature of the quantum effect , namely , the standard map which determining the coordinates of the classical ground state , is renormalized to an effective sawtooth map in the quantum case .",
    "the squeezed state results agree well with that of the quantum monte carlo method@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to apply the squeezed state to study generic behaviors of kicked quantum systems .",
    "it is well known that , in the development of quantum chaos , kicked quantum systems play a very important role .",
    "prototypes of these kicked systems are the kicked rotator and kicked harmonic oscillator ( kho ) .",
    "they represent two different classes of dynamical systems . on the one hand",
    ", the kicked rotator obeys the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem .",
    "classically , as the kick strength increases , invariant curves gradually break up .",
    "when the kick strength exceeds a critical value of @xmath1 , the last invariant curve disappears , and bounded chaos turns into global chaos , characterized by unbounded diffusion in the momentum direction@xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , the diffusion follows the classical one only up to a certain time , after which it is completely suppressed , thus leading to dynamical localization@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was connected to the anderson localization@xcite , and was confirmed experimentally@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "since a harmonic oscillator is a degenerate system , the kho model is out of the framework of the kam theorem , that is , diffusion can occur along stochastic webs for any small kick strength . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the kho model is not a toy model , it stems from a real physical system .",
    "it describes a charged particle moving in a magnetic field , and under the disturbance of a wave packet@xcite .",
    "it has @xmath2 degrees of freedom .",
    "classically , it depends on the ratio between frequency of the harmonic oscillator and that of the external kicks ( see eq.([freqrat ] ) ) , this system displays abundant structures in phase space such as crystal , quasicrystal , and stochastic webs @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the phase space of the kho is unbounded and can not be reduced to a cylinder as in the case of the kicked rotator model , numerical investigation of the quantum kho is much more difficult than that of the kicked rotator model .",
    "therefore , contrary to the kicked rotator , only a few attempts have been made in the quantum kho @xcite . a general picture about the quantum behavior of the kho is still lacking .    in this paper , using the squeezed state approach , we are able to obtain the diffusion behavior of the quantum kho model not only numerically but also analytically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief introduction of the squeezed state approach for purpose of self - containment in sec .",
    "iii , by using the kho model , we shall demonstrate that quantum fluctuations will enhance chaos at a small perturbation regime , whereas it will suppress chaotic diffusion at a large perturbation regime . in sec .",
    "vi , we shall study the diffusion and localization phenomena . in sec .",
    "v , comparisons between the squeezed state results and the very few available quantum results will be given .",
    "we shall conclude our paper with discussions and remarks in sec .",
    "vi . in appendix",
    "a , we apply this approach to quantize the harmonic oscillator which exactly yields eigenenergies and eigenfunctions . in appendix b ,",
    "we outline our procedure of the pure quantum computation for kho in some special cases .",
    "the squeezed state approach starts from the time - dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) formulation @xmath3 variation with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 gives rise to the schrdinger equation , and its complex conjugate ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the true solution may be approximated by restricting the choice of states to a subspace of the full hilbert space , and finding the path along which the above equation is satisfied within this subspace . in the squeezed state approach ,",
    "the squeezed coherent state is chosen as @xmath5 . in this manner , as we shall see below , in addition to the dynamics of centroid of wave packet , we will also have equations of motion for the fluctuations , i.e. , the spread of wave packet .",
    "therefore , this approach enables us to study the effects of the quantum fluctuations on dynamical behavior .",

    "the dot denotes the time derivative and the hamiltonian function @xmath36 is given by definition @xmath37 these equations ( [ eqmot1 ] ) , and ( [ eqmot2 ] ) give us a simple and clear picture about the motion of the expectation values as well as the evolution of the quantum fluctuations , which are responsible for quantum diffusion .",

    "thus the following two conditions are generally selected .",

    "this can be achieved by requesting minimization of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 for instance , for a harmonic oscillator ( appendix a ) we have @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we would like to discuss the effect of quantum fluctuations on classical chaos .",
    "it is commonly argued that quantum fluctuations suppress classical chaos due to interference , while enhancing chaos due to tunneling .",
    "this is a rather qualitative argument . with the help of the squeezed state approach , we are able to do a quantitative analysis of quantum fluctuations .    up to now ,",
    "there have been only a few works on this issue .",
    "in some models , suppression of chaos comes about , while in others enhancement takes place .",
    "zhang and co - workers observed suppression of chaos in kicked spin and the kicked rotator systems@xcite . using a one - dimensional problem with a duffing potential without any external perturbation , so that both classical and quantum behaviors are regular , pattanayak and schieve @xcite demonstrated that the squeezed state behavior is chaotic , and concluded that the quantum fluctuations induce chaos .",
    "the effect of enhancement was also confirmed in a kicked double well model@xcite .",
    "we shall see later that the kho model provides a prototype for studying these two effects .",
    "the enhancement and suppression can be observed by increasing the strength of the kicks .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum kho model can be written as@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 using the squeezed state as a trial wave function of hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , one can readily obtain @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator ; @xmath52 denotes the contribution from quantum fluctuations and @xmath53 } v(q ) \\delta_t\\ ] ] denots the contribution from the external perturbative potential",
    ". the external potential can be even or odd . without loss of generality ,",
    "we denote it as @xmath54 from eqs .",
    "( [ eqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eqmot2 ] ) , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is called the effective potential , whose physical meaning will be discussed below .",
    "@xmath57 is the first derivative of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear to see from eq .",
    "( [ moveq ] ) that , in the time interval @xmath60 , the harmonic oscillator takes the free motion governed by @xmath61 while , at the time @xmath62 , it is kicked by the external potential .",
    "therefore , before and after the kick the momentum and its fluctuation undergo jumps : @xmath63 eqs .",
    "( [ frmeq ] ) and ( [ ppi ] ) are coupled differential equations . from these equations",
    ", we can readily see that the squeezed state dynamics differs from the classical one in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) there are two additional dimensions for the squeezed state motion , namely , the particle moves in a four dimensional extended phase space .",
    "( 2 ) the classical quantities @xmath41 are coupled with the quantum fluctuations , which make the semiquantal motion complicated . on the one hand , because of these two additional dimensions in phase space , we expect that invariant curves in classical phase space would not be able to prevent the trajectory from penetrating or crossing them semiquantally . on the other hand ,",
    "since the quantum fluctuations are always positive , they equal zero only in the limiting case of @xmath64 ; the effective potential strength @xmath65 is always less than @xmath66 .",
    "the reduction of the effective potential acting on the wave packet leads to the suppression of chaos .",
    "these two mechanisms coexist in the semiquantal system .",
    "they compete with each other and determine the dynamical behavior of the underlying system .",
    "therefore , we expect that quantum fluctuations may not only enhance chaos but also suppress classical diffusion as well .",
    "this argument will be nicely illustrated in the following .    in this section",
    "we restrict our calculations on the potential @xmath67 however , we should point out that the main conclusions given in this section do not depend either on the parity of the potential or the sign of @xmath66 .      in solving eqs .",
    "( [ frmeq ] ) and ( [ ppi ] ) , we used the seventh and eighth order runge - kutta formula with adaptive stepsize control .",
    "the permissible error is fixed at @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we plot the classical phase space @xmath69 for a trajectory starting from ( 0,0 ) and evolving @xmath70 kicks .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the ratio between the angular frequency of the kicks @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ; @xmath76 is the period of the kicks ) and the angular frequency of the harmonic oscillator @xmath77 . in our calculations , we put @xmath78 .",
    "it is obvious that , in classical phase space , regular ( stable islands ) and chaotic regions coexists . fig .",
    "1(b ) shows the time evolution of expectation values @xmath41 of the wave packet for @xmath70 kicks .",
    "the wave packet starts from @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "the selection of initial conditions @xmath81 , and @xmath82 follows the minimum uncertainty and least quantum effect conditions given in sec .",
    "therefore , the initial wave packet has the same width in both @xmath59 and @xmath83 directions , that is , it is a coherent state . if there are no kicks , the wave packet starting from this point will evolve exactly along the classical particle s trajectories forever .",
    "the fluctuations both in momentum and coordinate keep constant , and are independent of time . in this case ,",
    "the squeezed state dynamics exactly describes the classical one .",
    "now , if we switch on the kick , the situation becomes quite different . as is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the initial point just lies in stochastic seas , thus it is evident that in the classical case the trajectory will never enter into stable islands due to the existence of invariant curves .",
    "however , as we predicted the invariant curves are not able to prevent the trajectory from crossing it via other dimensions semiquantally .",
    "this is demonstrated by fig .",
    "1(b ) , where all stable islands in the classical phase space are `` visited '' by the semiquantal trajectory .    as a quantitative verification , we have numerically calculated the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath84 for the trajectories in both cases . the time behavior of @xmath85 is shown in fig .",
    "it demonstrates the coexistence of enhancement and suppression . at the initial stage",
    "the enhancement mechanism is dominant .",
    "however , after a certain time , @xmath85 of the squeezed state becomes larger than its classical counterpart , which means that the enhancement mechanism becomes dominant , and consequently leads to enhancement of chaos .",
    "furthermore , the chaotic motion in the extended phase space is characterized by two positive lyapunov exponents in four - dimensional phase space @xmath86 which could be verified readily .",
    "we would like go to another limit , namely , very large perturbation , to investigate the suppression of chaos .",
    "classically , when @xmath66 increases , the motion becomes more and more chaotic . for a sufficient large @xmath66 such as @xmath87 , the classical motion is completely chaotic , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , where @xmath88 . like fig . 1 , fig .",
    "3 is for a trajectory starting from the origin and evolving @xmath70 kicks .",
    "the classical chaotic and diffusive process is easily seen from the evolution of this phase plot . to demonstrate the suppression of chaos ( or diffusion process ) , we start a wave packet from @xmath89 in the four - dimensional ( 4d ) squeezed state phase space . the evolution is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . comparing figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , it is obvious that , in the classical case , the phase space is chaotic and diffusive , whereas in the semiquantal case the diffusion process is largely slowed down and suppressed .",
    "there are invariant - curve - like structures that appear in the semiquantal phase space .",
    "these structures seem to form a barrier for diffusion and thus suppress chaos . the suppression of chaos is quantitatively demonstrated by the large decrease of @xmath85 , as is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the suppression mechanism is most important .    to illustrate the suppression , we plot variation of @xmath65 with time ( in units of kicks ) in fig .",
    "this plot indeed demonstrates that the effective perturbation strength is much less than its classical counterpart for most of the time during the evolution .",
    "this is the reason for the suppression .",
    "in fact , the deduction of the effective potential acting on the wave packet has a clear physical picture .",
    "the width of a wave packet centered at @xmath41 in coordinate space is @xmath90 , and the external potential has a wavelength of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , there are , in fact , @xmath92 periods of external potential acting on the wave packet simultaneously .",
    "this is quite different from the classical model , where only one kick acts on the particle at one time . since the external potential is negative in some places and positive in other places , the wider the wave packet , the larger the number of @xmath93 , and therefore , the smaller the effective potential acting on the harmonic oscillator",
    "however , if the wave packet @xmath94 is so small that it is smaller than the period of the external potential , then the effective potential is large . as a matter of fact , the effective potential @xmath65 in eq.([keff ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath95    as a significant evidence of the suppression , it is convenient to calculate energy diffusion with time @xmath96 ( in units of kicks ) for an ensemble of trajectories . the diffusion is defined by @xmath97 subtracts initial averaging energy @xmath98 , where @xmath99 means ensemble the average over many trajectories . in our calculations",
    "we have taken such an ensemble averaging over @xmath70 initial points which are uniformly distributed inside a disk area centered at the origin of the phase space . for the classical one , @xmath100 , and for semiquantal dynamics , @xmath101 is defined by @xmath102 in fig .",
    "6 , we show the energy diffusion of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for classical and semiquantal cases .",
    "the suppression of classical diffusion is very obvious .",
    "we have seen so far that enhancement may happen at the small @xmath66 regime , and suppression at the large @xmath66 regime .",
    "now we would like to discuss the transition from enhancement to suppression by changing the strength of the external potential for fixed quantum fluctuations .",
    "here we want to show that there exists a threshold value of @xmath103 distinguishing enhancement from suppression .    to this end",
    ", we need to take an appropriate ensemble average over many trajectories in phase space .",
    "however , since the classical phase space of the kho model is unbounded , it is impossible to do such an average over the whole phase space .",
    "this makes numerical works very difficult .",
    "after many numerical experiments , we find a compromise , namely , we take the average over a disk centered at origin with radius @xmath104 .",
    "we spread @xmath105 initial points uniformly distributed inside this area . in classical case",
    ", we calculate the lyapunov exponent for each trajectory after @xmath70 kicks , and plot the averaged value denoted as @xmath106 in fig .",
    "this averaged value is in analogy to the kolmogorov entropy in a bounded system .",
    "however , strictly speaking , this quantity can not be called kolmogorov entropy .",
    "nevertheless , this parameter captures more or less chaoticity of the underlying system . in the case of semiquantal dynamics , since we have 4d extended phase space , we always have two positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "we add these two values , and denote the result as @xmath107 .",
    "it is plotted in fig . 7 in comparison with the classical result .    from fig .",
    "7 we can draw the following conclusions : ( 1 ) there exists a certain threshold value of @xmath103 . before this point , @xmath108 , which means that the degree of chaos is enhanced ; after this point , @xmath109 , chaos is suppressed . this critical value",
    "@xmath103 changes with @xmath110 .",
    "( 2 ) at the region of @xmath111 , @xmath112 fluctuates around a certain value .",
    "it does not change with @xmath66 .",
    "( 3 ) the enhancement and suppression depends largely on @xmath110 .    the results discussed in this section are restricted to an irrational frequency ratio .",
    "one might ask , whether our conclusion also applies to the rational frequency ratio .",
    "it is well known that the kho model is a degenerate system out of the kam theorem . in classical phase space , there exists a slow diffusion along the stochastic web for any small value of perturbation .",
    "our numerical results also show enhancement and suppression .",
    "we give one example of rational frequency ratio @xmath113 and @xmath87 in fig . 8 for suppression .",
    "the corresponding lyapunov exponent is shown in fig . 9 .",
    "finally , we would like to say a few words about the initial conditions and parity of the external potential . we have performed a wide range of numerical investigations , and found that the above discussed qualitative and quantitative conclusions are independent of the selection of the initial condition and the parity of the external potential .",
    "however , the selection of the initial condition must be physically meaningful , as we discussed in sec .",
    "ii .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to discuss the connection of suppression to the dynamical localization .",
    "in fact , this is a challenge to the squeezed state approach for this subtle phenomenon .",
    "we argued that the dynamical localization observed in the kicked rotator is due to a suppression of the chaos discussed above .",
    "in fact , in the limiting case of @xmath114 , the kho model eq .",
    "[ [ ham2 ] ] is reduced to the kicked rotator model , in which chaotic diffusion is completely suppressed by the quantum fluctuations and results in dynamical localization , a well established fact observed numerically by casati _",
    "et al_@xcite almost 20 years ago , and confirmed recently by experiment@xcite .",
    "this was nicely illustrated by zhang and lee@xcite with the squeezed state approach .",
    "iii we showed how quantum fluctuations enhance and suppress chaos .",
    "this fact will definitely affect diffusion behavior .",
    "for instance , in the limiting case , when the suppression becomes dominant localization is expected to happen . in this section",
    "we shall give a detailed study of this .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the large @xmath66 regime .",
    "this is the most difficult region in pure quantum computation . as we shall see the squeezed state approach not only provides an easy way to do numerical calculations but also makes it possible to do some analytical estimations .",
    "the energy @xmath115 of the kicked harmonic oscillator in the squeezed state approximation [ eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ] can be written as two parts , @xmath116 @xmath117 contains the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) , which is due to the motion of the centroid of a wave packet .",
    "they mimic the effect of classical diffusion ( ecd ) .",
    "@xmath118 includes the last three terms in eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) , and is attributed to the effects of quantum fluctuations ( eqf ) .",
    "these two kinds of effects are the main ingredients of the diffusion process in the squeezed state dynamics .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 is an important quantity , as we shall see soon .",
    "we take @xmath119 , the golden mean value @xmath120 , and its continued - fraction expansion @xmath121 : @xmath122 , @xmath123 as examples . @xmath124 and @xmath125 are generated by the fibonacci sequence defined by @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for @xmath128 . without loss of generality , in all calculations , we keep parameters @xmath129 , @xmath87 , @xmath130 , and @xmath78 , and the initial point is chosen as @xmath89 , which corresponds to the ground state of unperturbed quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "figures 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 show our numerical results of energy diffusion of @xmath131 for even and odd parity , respectively .",
    "now we discuss these two cases separately .",
    "_ even potential _ : in this case , for all rational frequencies , the energy will finally goes quadratically with time i.e. @xmath132 . as shown in fig .",
    "10 , the slope equals 2 asymptotically in the double logarithmic plot .",
    "however , for the case @xmath133 with relatively larger @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the diffusion starts only after a certain time . before this time the energy diffusion is localized .",
    "the transient time depends on the frequency ratios , and is approximately of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "we call this transient region a _ transient dynamical localization _ region .    for the irrational case ,",
    "dynamical localization occurs , as clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "this significant phenomenon has been observed and investigated in various quantum systems in past few years .",
    "it is worth pointing out that for two trivial cases , i.e. @xmath135 and @xmath136 , our squeezed state results given here agree _",
    "completely _ with the quantum analytical results of ref.@xcite which has been the only existing analytical results of the quantum diffusion of this model up to now .",
    "this demonstrates the usefulness of the squeezed state approach .",
    "moreover , by using the squeezed state approach , we have also recovered the quantum results obtained numerically by borgonovi and rebuzzini @xcite . for more details , see sec v. +   + _ odd potential _ : in this case , quadratic law is observed only in the case of rational frequency ratios @xmath137 with odd @xmath125 . for other situations",
    "the energy diffuses linearly with time approximately , see figs .",
    "12 and 13 .      the above numerical results can be understood by analyzing evolution equations ( [ moveq ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can analytically derive the energy diffusion by studying system ( [ moveq ] ) .",
    "starting from eqs .",
    "( [ moveq ] ) , we find that when the external perturbation is absent , the two degrees of freedom ( dof s ) @xmath138 and @xmath139 are decoupled , and each undergoes free motion . in terms of action - angle variable , the hamiltonian of the free motions can be expressed as eq .",
    "( [ homeq ] ) . from this formula",
    ", we have already seen that _ both _ free motions of the two dof s are _ degenerate_. it is this degeneracy which makes resonance between the two frequencies possible in phase space .",
    "consequently , the squeezed state dynamical behavior of the kicked harmonic oscillator is quite different from that of the kicked rotator@xcite .",
    "that is , the motions of the centroid and the fluctuations of the wave packet behave like an oscillator with fixed frequencies @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "however , when kicks are added , the two degree of freedom becomes coupled , and energy may start to diffuse .",
    "it is convenient to express the evolution of system in terms of action - angle variables . from eqs .",
    "( [ ijaction ] ) and ( [ homeq ] ) one can readily obtain 4d maps @xmath142 with this 4d map , we are able to performe analytical estimate of the energy diffusion",
    ". we shall treat it at two different limiting cases .",
    "_ classical diffusion effect ( @xmath64 ) _    in the classical limit case , @xmath64 , and @xmath143 , and the effect of classical diffusion becomes dominant .",
    "therefore , the change of energy during one kick is @xmath144 for @xmath145 , the orbit can be supposed to be approximately ergodic .",
    "after ensemble averaging over variables @xmath83 and @xmath59 , the first two terms vanish approximately , thus we obtain linear energy diffusion , @xmath146 note that the average of the first two terms of @xmath147 , though is much smaller than the last term for large @xmath66 , is nevertheless not exactly zero .",
    "this results in some oscillations of @xmath115 around the linearity ( see figs . 12 and 13 ) .",
    "_ effect of quantum fluctuations _    for",
    "the second limit case , suppose a wave packet starts from @xmath148 with an even potential , and the center of the wave packet keeps fixed , thus @xmath149 .",
    "the energy diffusion is caused purely by the effects of the quantum fluctuations . in this case",
    "we shall analyze the diffusion process for two different frequency ratios , i.e. , rational and irrational .",
    "for the rational frequency ratio , let us take the simple case of @xmath150 as an example . during a time of 3 t , there are three kicks acting on the harmonic oscillator . since the frequency of fluctuation is 2@xmath140 , @xmath27 evolves four periods .",
    "note that the effective amplitude of a kick acting on the wave packet is @xmath65 rather than @xmath66 . among these three kicks ,",
    "_ only _ that one at a relative small @xmath45 affect the free motion of the oscillator significantly .",
    "we call this kick the _ effective _ kick , the effects from other two kicks can be neglected due to a very large @xmath45 , and consequently a very small @xmath65 . at the time",
    "when the next _ effective _ kick is in action , @xmath45 is approximately the same because of the resonance , see fig . 14 .",
    "therefore , the increment of @xmath151 is almost constant , which means that @xmath152 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ sme ] ) , we obtain @xmath153 which gives rise to the quadratic law observed in figs .",
    "10 and 12 .",
    "if @xmath119 is an irrational number , a very interesting thing will happen . from eq .",
    "( [ hameff ] ) we know that the angular variable when a kick is added is @xmath154 this is nothing but a pseudorandom number generator , indicating that the jump of @xmath151 may happen in upper @xmath155 and lower parts @xmath156 with the same probability , and thus the increment of energy in the upper part will be canceled out by the decrease in the lower part .",
    "this leads to the localization phenomenon observed in fig .",
    "this localization mechanism , resorting to a pseudorandom number generator , reminds us what happens in the kicked rotator , where the localization is related to anderson s localization for a quantum particle propagating in a one - dimensional lattice in the presence of a static - random potential @xcite .",
    "our results imply that it might also be possible to construct a connection between the kicked harmonic oscillator and the anderson s problem in the framework of the squeezed state approximation .",
    "the mechanism discussed can also explain the transient dynamical localization that occurs in the case of the rational frequency ratio , as shown in fig .",
    "since during the time @xmath157 , a rational number behaves just like a pseudoirrational number , a transient localization phenomenon occurs .",
    "_ general case _    as to the general case of system ( [ moveq ] ) , both the ecd and eqf may coexist . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath137 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are coprimed integers .",
    "suppose @xmath125 is odd .",
    "as we have explained above , between two _ effective _ kicks , @xmath41 and @xmath27 evolve freely .",
    "thus the angle variables of @xmath41 at the two successive _ effective _ kicks are @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively , and that of @xmath27 are @xmath160 and @xmath161 . from eqs .",
    "( [ homeq ] ) and ( [ moveq ] ) , we find that in this case , the increment of @xmath162 and @xmath163 have the same sign , which means that both the ecd and eqf are excited , which is independent of the potential parity .",
    "because the diffusion due to the eqf is @xmath164 , which is much faster than that of the ecd ( @xmath165 ) , thus asymptotically @xmath166 diffusion shows up as shown in fig .",
    "12 . however , if @xmath125 is even , there is one additional _ effective _ kick between the above mentioned two , namely , the @xmath167th kick , at which the angle variable of @xmath27 is @xmath168 , while that of @xmath41 is @xmath169 .",
    "thus , for the even potential case , the changes of @xmath151 due to the two consecutive _ effective _ kicks have the same sign , which implies that the eqf is excited and @xmath166 diffusion will show up .",
    "for the odd potential case , the change of @xmath151 due to the two consecutive _ effective _ kicks have opposite sign , the eqf is thus suppressed , and we obtain the linear diffusion as seen in fig",
    ". 13 .    for the irrational @xmath119 case ,",
    "the eqf is suppressed and the ecd becomes dominant .",
    "if the @xmath138 happens to be a fixed point in @xmath138 plane as is the case of fig .",
    "11 , localization occurs .",
    "this is the reason for the different diffusion behavior of irrational @xmath119 in figs .",
    "11 and 13 for even and odd external potentials , respectively .",
    "please note that @xmath170 are the expectation values of all the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator , thus the localization we observed in fig .",
    "11 is not restricted to the case of the ground state , as we discussed up to now , but is very general .",
    "the results discussed above focused on diffusion at very large perturbation , in this case the underlying classical system is completely chaotic . as a further example we would like to demonstrate a very interesting and important phenomenon in quantum mechanics , i.e. the _ tunneling effect_. we start a wave packet from point ( 0,7.5 ) in the classical phase space @xmath41 .",
    "here we have @xmath171 and @xmath172 with @xmath173 .",
    "the wave packet has parameter @xmath174 and @xmath175 according to the minimal uncertainty principle .",
    "it is a gaussian wave packet . the classical phase space is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the starting point lies inside a stable island .",
    "classically , a trajectory that starts from this point will never be able to escape .",
    "however , in the quantum case , the situation becomes very different .",
    "we expect that if the width of the wave packet is much smaller than the size of this stable island , the wave packet will be confined by this stable island , and thus lead to localization .",
    "however , if the wave packet becomes wider than the size of the stable island , it will spread out .",
    "here we demonstrate this quantum phenomenon by the squeezed state approach . in figs .",
    "15(b)-15(d ) we plot the energy evolution for different planck constant @xmath110 , which corresponds to different widths of the initial wave packet . at @xmath129 and @xmath176",
    "we observed a localization phenomenon as in other quantum systems .",
    "the energy oscillates around a certain value . when we increase @xmath110 further to @xmath177 .",
    "a transition from localization to delocalization occurs which is shown in fig .",
    "to give the reader a clear picture about the accuracy of the squeezed state approach , we would like to compare our results with those obtained from pure quantum computation .",
    "however , as mentioned above , since diffusion occurs in the whole unbounded phase space and can not be reduced to motion on a cylinder like the case of the kicked rotator , a pure quantum ( numerical ) investigation is very difficult , in particular , in the large @xmath66 regime .",
    "nevertheless , with a large amount of cpu time , one would be able to obtain some results in the small @xmath66 regime for short time evolution .",
    "this is why there are only limited available quantum results in this regime .",
    "we will compare them with our squeezed state results here .",
    "first , let us look at the results obtained in ref.@xcite , already shown in fig",
    ". 10 . as for the case of 1/1 and 1/2 ,",
    "our squeezed state results agree completely with the quantum one in ref.@xcite . in this case both squeezed state and pure quantal analyses predict @xmath166 growth of the energy .",
    "we should mention that it was conjectured in ref.@xcite that for the general case of @xmath178 , the energy growth should less than @xmath166 . from our squeezed state analysis we concluded that there are only three different diffusions : @xmath166 , @xmath179 and localization .",
    "therefore , our squeezed state analysis also agrees with ref.@xcite s prediction .",
    "now we turn to the results obtained by borgonovi and rebuzzini@xcite .",
    "since the time unit given in their pictures is not clear , we are not able to make any quantitative comparison with our squeezed state results .",
    "therefore , we performed quantum calculations by using our own program ( see appendix b ) .",
    "all the system parameters are kept the same as that used by borgonovi and rebuzzini .",
    "the results are given in figs .",
    "16 and 17 .",
    "these pictures correspond to different diffusion behaviors . in fig .",
    "16 , a @xmath166 diffusion is obtained ( @xmath179 is in units of kicks ) ; the squeezed state approach also gives rise to a @xmath166 diffusive behavior , although there is a difference in prefactor . in fig .",
    "17 , both the quantum and squeezed state results show localization around approximately the same energy .",
    "please compare these two pictures with figs . 1 and 8 of borgonovi and rebuzzini@xcite , respectively .",
    "our quantum computation technique ( appendix b ) is different from that used in ref.@xcite . for a self - consistent test",
    ", we have used the same parameter as that of fig . 2 in ref.@xcite , and computed the energy diffusion with our method .",
    "we found that our results agree with those of ref.@xcite in every detail .",
    "as already emphasized , because of the unbounded phase space , the quantum computation is very time consuming , even for small perturbation .",
    "for instance , about ten days cpu time ( ibm risc system/6000 42 t , with 192 mbyte ram ) has been spent for fig .",
    "16 , and 20 days cpu time for fig .",
    "applying the squeezed state approach to the kicked quantum harmonic oscillator , we illustrate how the quantum fluctuations affect the classical dynamics .",
    "we have shown that chaoticity can be enhanced as well as suppressed by the quantum fluctuations . a transition from enhancement to suppression",
    "is observed when we change the strength of the kicks .",
    "moreover , with this squeezed state approach , we are able to investigate the energy diffusion .",
    "three different energy diffusion have been observed for the kicked quantum harmonic oscillator , namely , localization , linear diffusion , and quadratic diffusion .",
    "the localization is due to strong suppression .",
    "though it is a kind of approximation , the squeezed state can mimic many true quantum behaviors such as those demonstrated in this paper .",
    "moreover , there are examples showing that the squeezed state approach gives rise to better results than the semiclassical method . however ,",
    "under which condition or how far the squeezed state approach can go beyond the semiclassical method is still an open problem that deserves further numerical as well as theoretical study .    finally , we would like to remark on the quantization of a quantum system whose classical counterpart is chaotic .",
    "as is well known , this is a tough problem which has attracted tremendous attentions in last two decades . among many others ,",
    "gutzwiller s trace formula might be the most plausible one@xcite . however , this approach encountered difficulty of divergence , although many important contributions have been made to overcome this difficulty .",
    "we believe that the squeezed state approach might be an alternative way that can contribute to this .",
    "recent successful application of this method by pattanayak and schieve@xcite to calculate eigenenergies of a chaotic system sheds light on this direction .",
    "* acknowledgement .",
    "* we would like to thank dr .",
    "l .- h tang and dr .",
    "f. borgonovi for many stimulating discussions .",
    "the work was supported in part by grants from the hong kong research grants council ( rgc ) and the hong kong baptist university faculty research grant ( frg ) .",
    "in this appendix , we would like to demonstrate how the squeezed state works when applied to a simple quantum system , a harmonic oscillator , which is the kho system with a zero external potential .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is a simple but very important model in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is an integrable system , and its eigenenergies as well as eigenfunctions can be obtained analytically .",
    "therefore , this model is very suitable for testing approximate methods such as the wkb method and others .",
    "it is well known that the wkb approximation can give us exact eigenenergies for this integrable system .",
    "however , it can not yields exact eigenfunctions , in particular , for the low - lying eigenstates .",
    "it gives only the envelope of the wave function in the semiclassical limit @xmath180 . in this appendix",
    ", we shall demonstrate that when applying the squeezed state approach to the harmonic oscillator model , one can obtain the energy levels precisely as well as the eigenfunctions .",
    "the harmonic oscillator has the hamiltonian operator @xmath181 applying the squeezed state approach to this system , one can easily obtain @xmath182 this hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of action - angle variables @xmath183 where @xmath184 the transformations between @xmath185 , @xmath27 and @xmath186 , @xmath187 have the following forms : @xmath188 from eq .",
    "( [ homeq ] ) one can see that the motion of _ both _ degrees of freedom are _ degenerate _ , namely , @xmath189 is independent of @xmath190 and @xmath191 independent of @xmath192 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 are decoupled from @xmath41 .",
    "thus the centroid of the wave packet goes exactly along the classical trajectory .",
    "while the fluctuations in momentum and position are time independent , i.e. , the width of the wave packet keeps constant . from the minimal uncertainty principle for the initial condition mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , we have @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , the wave packet along the periodic orbit always keeps its form as a coherent state .",
    "the time evolution of both @xmath41 and @xmath27 are periodic with period @xmath195 and @xmath196 , respectively .",
    "so we can apply the ebk quantization to the extended phase space , @xmath197 substituting @xmath190 and @xmath192 into eq .",
    "( [ hameff ] ) and keeping in mind that @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and thus @xmath93=0 , we obtain the squeezed state eigenenergy , @xmath198 this is exactly the eigenenergy of the harmonic oscillator . here",
    "the zero point energy @xmath199 comes into the formula in a very natural and straightforward way .",
    "this is quite different from the wkb method . in the wkb method",
    ", @xmath199 comes from the maslov phase correction which is necessary because of the singularity of the wave function . in the squeezed state approach ,",
    "since we do not have any singularities , the maslov - morse correction is incorporated by the extended variables @xmath45 and @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the system is in the form of the expectation value of the underlying hamiltonian operator , whereas in the usual wkb method , the energy is taken to be the classical form , i.e. , @xmath200 .",
    "this is one of the reasons that people call this approach the _",
    "semiquantum approach_.    let us now construct the eigenfunction by the squeezed state approach .",
    "we see that when the trial wave function @xmath5 is transformed to @xmath201 into the schrdinger equation , we can determine the equation of @xmath202 , @xmath203 the second part of the integral corresponds to the dynamical phase .",
    "we denote it @xmath204 .",
    "the first term is the geometrical phase noted as @xmath205 , which is @xmath206 since the motions of @xmath138 and @xmath27 are periodic , this geometrical phase is the aharanov - anandan form of berry s phase . during the evolution , each points along the periodic orbit acquires a phase factor .",
    "however , the dynamical phase does not change during the evolution , only the geometrical phase matters .",
    "so the eigenfunction is a weighted sum over points of the commensurate periodic orbit@xcite .",
    "the weight factor at each point is an appropriate geometrical phase .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above according to the requirement of the initial condition , the initial wave packet is a coherent wave packet , and it does not change its form when cycling along the periodic orbit . substituting expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ homeq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ geophase ] ) , and keeping in mind that @xmath194 , we can easily evaluate the integral and obtain the geometrical phase at time @xmath179 , which is @xmath207 where @xmath208 .",
    "thus the eigenfunction for the bound state having the eigenenergy @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ hoen ] ) is @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the coherent state , @xmath158 is the angle in the @xmath211 plane , and @xmath212 is the normalization constant .",
    "this is nothing but the number eigenstate @xmath15 given in eq .",
    "( [ numberst ] ) except for the prefactor .",
    "this constant @xmath212 can be easily calculated by the normalization .",
    "therefore , in the coordinate representation , the wave function is @xmath213 this is the exact wave function of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in this appendix , we describe our procedure of quantum computation .",
    "since the hamiltonian is periodic in time , the floquet theory can be applied .",
    "the time evolution can be reduced to evolution of the eigenstate over one driving period , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the floquet operator .    to simulate quantum diffusion in this degenerate system ( [ ham2 ] ) , the fourier spectral method is employed .",
    "the time interval of free propagation is divided into many slices , each having a width of @xmath216 . for each slice",
    "the evolution operator is factored into a product of kinetic and potential propagator arranged in a symmetric way so that a full potential step is sandwiched between two half kinetic steps , namely , @xmath217 this technique of symmetrically splitting the kinetic propagator reduces the error introduced by neglecting the commutator between the kinetic and potential operators .",
    "the error is reduced to @xmath218 from @xmath219 in a nonsymmetric splitting .",
    "the kinetic propagation is carried out in momentum space , since in this space the time evolution is simplified as multiplication . the potential step is performed in coordinate space for the same reason .",
    "the kick step , performed once per period , is also done in coordinate space .",
    "a fast fourier transform routine is used to transform wave function between these two spaces .    since the kho model is a degenerate system , a wave packet may diffuse rapidly , even to infinity in both coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the average energy of the wave packet may reach a rather high value during the diffusion .",
    "this amplifies the error caused by the approximation made in eq .",
    "( [ esplit ] ) .",
    "therefore , the self - adaptative procedure is used to adjust the time slice in eq .",
    "( [ esplit ] ) in each period to make sure that the width of the time slice is much smaller than the inverse energy .",
    "second , both coordinate and momentum spaces should be large enough .",
    "so a large number ( 32  768 ) of fourier components are used in our computations .",
