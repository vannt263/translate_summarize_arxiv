    "titanium carbide is one the hardest transition metal binary carbides known , which renders it resistant to wear and makes it a favorable material for applications such as drill bits and cutting tools . with a melting point of over 3000@xmath0c , it is thermally quite stable .",
    "however , transition metal binary carbides are brittle , difficult to machine , and highly susceptible to thermal shock .",
    "the ternary carbides known as @xmath14 ( max ) phases @xcite ( where @xmath15 = 1,2 , or 3 and @xmath16 is a transition metal , @xmath17 is a group a element mostly from groups 13 and 14 , and @xmath18 is either c or n ) often overcome some of these shortcomings , while still being heat tolerant . as a class , the max phases have unusual  yet attractive and often unique  combinations of properties that bring together some of the best attributes of ceramics and metals @xcite . like metals , they are excellent electric and thermal conductors , with exceptional thermal shock resistance and damage tolerance @xcite . in some cases , they are creep @xcite , oxidation @xcite , and fatigue @xcite resistant .",

    "the data from the three rotations and the detector rings were integrated , resulting in one histogram per detector bank . due to the large detector coverage of hippo ,",

    "while the overall expansions and anisotropies in the three max - like phases are comparable , the most interesting aspect of this work is the relationship between bond length evolution and the stacking of the octahedra among the three phases . in the literature ,",
    "it is fairly well established , both experimentally and theoretically , that the @xmath16c bonds adjacent to the @xmath17 layers ( _ i.e. _ ti@xmath34-c in fig .",

    "c lengths in table [ table:523bonds ] are fully consistent with this general conclusion .",
    "not surprisingly , the ti  c bond lengths in the 211 slab in the 523 phase are almost identical to those of the 211 phase [ fig . [ fig:523bonds](c ) ] .",
    "similarly , the ti ",
    "c bond lengths in the 312 phase are very similar to those of the 312 slabs in the 523 phase [ fig . [ fig:523bonds](c ) ] .",
    "this applies not only to the absolute ti ",
    "c bond lengths values but also to their thermal expansions , which are quite comparable as well [ fig .",
    "[ fig:523struct](c ) ] .",
    "it should be noted that the longest bonds in the 312-stacked octahedra in ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 are slightly shorter than @xmath49 in ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 , while the ti  c bonds in the 211-stacked octahedra in ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 are slightly longer than those in ti@xmath3alc [ fig . [ fig:523bonds](c ) ] .",
    "this suggests that the structure is slightly more uniform than the individual 211- and 312-stacked phases due to the interleaved nature of the stacking sequences .",
    "these comments notwithstanding , it is clear from fig . [",
    "fig:523bonds](c ) that the same structural units behave similarly .",
    "these results are gratifying because they indirectly validate our rietveld analysis .",
    "the situation for the ti - al bonds is not as clear . since the difference between the 211 and 312 phases is the number of ti ",
    "c octahedra between al layers , it is expected that only the ti ",
    "c bonds would be significantly affected by the change in ti ",
    "c stacking while the al  ti bonds should be similar among the three phases .",
    "however , we find that the al  ti bonds are clearly affected by stoichiometry [ fig . [ fig:523bonds](d ) ] : @xmath50 is significantly longer in the 211 phase [ black diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig:523bonds](d ) ] than in the 312 phase [ red crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig:523bonds](d ) ] , while the opposite is true of those bonds in the 523 phase ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath51 in ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 [ compare blue circles and blue squares in [ fig:523bonds](d ) ] .",
    "the reasons for this state of affairs are not fully understood , but are likely related to the following observations :    a.   the ti ",
    "c bonds are relatively stiff building blocks of the individual 312 and 211 units , as evidenced by the fact that they stay relatively the same size as in the original ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 and ti@xmath3alc phases when the stacking sequences are interleaved .",
    "the dimension within the crystal that thus has the most flexibility is the al  ti bond .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the al  ti bond plays a role as an effective `` compensating spring '' in the structure to minimize the crystal energy .",
    "furthermore , this role would be different  and most probably more dominant  in the more complex ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 higher - order phase .",
    "b.   among the possible factors that could be compensated for in the flexible al  ti bond discussed above are those related to constraints on the lattice parameters  especially on the @xmath9-lattice parameter , which essentially determines the al  ti bond length , given that the ti ",
    "c octahedra are rigid blocks . in a sample with multiple competing phases ,",
    "it is likely that these effects are prominent and manifest themselves in the al  ti bond . c.   the al atoms in ti@xmath3alc and ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 lie in a mirror plane within the structures , while al is not constrained to mirror symmetry between the ti ",
    "c atoms in the ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 phase ( see fig . [ fig:523struct ] ) .",
    "therefore , the changes in the al  ti distances in the 211-stacked and 312-stacked structures that occur when they are interleaved to form 523 may be a consequence of the symmetry break .",
    "these comments notwithstanding , it is important to note that the average ti  al bond length in 523 ( 2.863  ) is equal the average of the al  ti bond lengths in 312 and 211 ( also 2.863  ) .",
    "the average expansions of those bonds are also similar ( see below ) . while more work is needed to fully understand the al  ti bond length behavior , it can be reasonably concluded that the dimensions of the ti  c units are consistent for a given stacking , regardless of whether they are interleaved in a higher - order phase or in a conventional max phase . based on this fact and the inconsistency of the al  ti bonds , it is further speculated that the al  ti bonds serve to compensate other energy minimization factors for the crystal , especially those related to symmetry and lattice constraints .      in ti@xmath3alc and ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 , the al ",
    "ti bonds show the highest expansion [ see table [ table:523exp ] and figs . [ fig:523exp](b ) and [ fig:523exp](c ) ] . to our knowledge , there are no previous reports of temperature - dependent bond lengths in any of the ti ",

    "similarly , a higher expansion rate was observed for the @xmath17@xmath16 bonds than the @xmath16c bonds in ti@xmath4sic@xmath3 @xcite and cr@xmath3gec @xcite .",
    "this result is also consistent with a high - pressure xrd study of ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 , where the al  ti@xmath34 bond was the most compressible , while the ti@xmath34c and ti@xmath35c bonds were more rigid @xcite .    in ti@xmath2alc@xmath3 , the expansion rate of the al  ti@xmath34 bond ",
    "14.6 @xmath12 k@xmath13 is the highest of all the bonds in the sample , but the al  ti@xmath36 bond expansion is unexpectedly low , at 5.5 @xmath12 k@xmath13   ( table [ table:523bonds ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the average bond expansion in 523 ( 10.5 @xmath12 k@xmath13 ) is still similar to the 211 and 312 average ( 11.3 @xmath12 k@xmath13 ) .",
    "also note that the error bars for the al  ti bond expansions in ti@xmath2al@xmath3c@xmath4 are the highest of those for the bonds in all phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:523exp ] ) .",
    "this uncertainty further suggests that the al  ti bond behavior is flexible within the structure and indicates other crystal imperfections and/or symmetry and lattice dimension effects , as discussed above .      the results in fig .",

    "the high adps of al , both calculated and experimental , relative to the ti and c atomic displacement values [ figs .",
    "[ fig:523adp](a)-(c ) ] are also consistent with the relatively weaker al bonding evidenced by the higher al  ti expansion rates , at least in ti@xmath3alc and ti@xmath4alc@xmath3 ( table [ table:523bonds ] ) and the flexibility of the al  ti interaction , as discussed above .",
    "previous htnd studies of ti@xmath4sic@xmath3 @xcite , ti@xmath4gec@xmath3 @xcite , ti@xmath3aln @xcite , cr@xmath3gec @xcite , and ti@xmath52aln@xmath4 @xcite have shown the same rattling phenomenon for the a - group element .",
    "a comparison of the vibrational behavior of al with two other htnd studies of the al - containing nitrides ti@xmath3aln and ti@xmath52aln@xmath4 ( fig . [ fig : u - al - all ] ) further suggests that this `` rattling '' effect is independent of stacking sequence .    the results shown in figs .
