    "asteroseismology of solar - like stars is developing rapidly , driven by the successes of the space telescopes corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite . by studying the oscillation modes of these stars , inferences can be made about their interior structures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . except for the most basic analyses , it is crucial to identify the oscillation modes , that is , the radial order @xmath1 and the spherical degree @xmath2 .    in the sun and similar stars ,",
    "mode identification is straightforward thanks to the distinctive pattern of alternating odd and even modes in the power spectrum .",
    "this pattern consists of a regular sequence of @xmath3 modes , interspersed with close pairs of @xmath4 and 2 modes that fall approximately halfway in between .",
    "however , stars significantly hotter than the sun have large linewidths that blur the @xmath5 pairs and make mode identification very difficult . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate a solution to this problem that applies the method proposed by @xcite and @xcite , which uses the _",
    "absolute _ frequencies of the oscillation modes .",
    "for main - sequence stars , the frequencies are well - approximated by the asymptotic relation @xcite , @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the large separation between modes of the same degree @xmath2 and consecutive order @xmath1 , @xmath8 is the small separation between modes of different degree and @xmath0 is a dimensionless offset , which we discuss in greater detail below . typically , only modes of @xmath9 are observed in intensity due to cancellation over the unresolved stellar disk , although @xmath10 modes can be observed in the highest signal - to - noise targets , such as 11 _ kepler _ subgiants for which frequencies have been determined by @xcite and the solar analogs 16  cyg  a  and  b @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic relation makes it easy to determine the mode degrees for the sun and similar stars . each @xmath4 mode",
    "is separated by @xmath11 from an @xmath12 , and separated by @xmath13 from the @xmath3 mode of the same order .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig1]a for the _ kepler _ star kic  6933899 , which has an effective temperature of 5840k .",
    "mode linewidth increases with effective temperature @xcite , reflecting shorter mode lifetimes in hotter stars . in some f - type stars , the linewidths become so large that the pairs of @xmath4 and @xmath12 modes are unresolved and it becomes difficult to distinguish between the blended @xmath5 modes and the @xmath3 modes .",
    "this problem was first observed by corot , in the f5 star hd49933 @xcite and has since been seen in other corot stars @xcite and in the bright f5 star procyon @xcite .",
    "we also see it in many _ kepler _ stars and figure",
    "[ fig1]b shows one example , kic  2837475 ( @xmath14k ) .    one way to resolve",
    "this identification problem is to fit both possible mode identifications and compare the relative likelihoods of the two scenarios @xcite .",
    "this relies on the profile of the even-@xmath2 modes being significantly broader and also asymmetric , relative to the @xmath3 modes ( owing to the presence of the smaller amplitude @xmath12 modes at a slightly lower frequency than the @xmath4 modes ) .",
    "the correct scenario should provide a better fit to the power spectrum .",
    "difficulties arise at low signal - to - noise and with short observations , for which the lorentzian mode profiles are not well resolved .",
    "this method was first applied by @xcite , who fitted both scenarios for hd49933 . however , with additional data their preferred mode identification was overturned by @xcite .",
    "other methods have been suggested that utilize the sign of the small separation @xmath15 @xcite . in main sequence stars like the sun",
    ", @xmath15 is known to be positive . however , in many red giants @xmath15 is found to be negative @xcite , so at some point in the evolution the sign must flip @xcite . to further complicate matters , the value of @xmath15 is quite small . at low signal - to - noise , it may be difficult to obtain frequencies precise enough to determine the sign of @xmath15 reliably .",
    "@xcite have suggested that scaling the frequencies of a star with a known mode identification could reveal the correct mode identification in a second star .",
    "this method seeks to use information contained within the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for this to be effective , @xmath0 must vary slowly as a function of stellar parameters .",
    "this is indeed the case , with a tight relationship between @xmath0 and effective temperature , @xmath16 , found both in models @xcite and in observations of sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath0 promises to be an effective way to determine mode identifications , since the difference in the value of @xmath0 for the two possible scenarios is large ( 0.5 ) .",
    "the existence of a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath16 is not surprising .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is determined by the upper and lower turning points of the acoustic waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as such",
    ", @xmath0 is heavily dependent upon the stellar atmosphere , of which @xmath16 is a significant parameter . due to inadequate modeling of the near - surface layers ,",
    "there is a well - known offset between observed and computed oscillation frequencies in the sun @xcite and also in other stars @xcite .",
    "this offset results in the computed @xmath0 being smaller than observed , typically by @xmath17 as inferred from the displacement of model tracks from observations in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to extend the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath16 to higher temperatures , and thereby make reliable mode identifications in f - type stars .",
    "we used observations of solar - like oscillations in 163 stars taken with the _ kepler _ space telescope between may 2009 and march 2011 ( quarters 18 ) .",
    "each star was observed in _",
    "kepler s _ short - cadence mode ( 58.9 s sampling ) for part of this period .",
    "the time series were prepared from the raw observations as described by @xcite and further corrected to remove outliers and jumps as described by @xcite .",
    "effective temperatures were determined from sdss @xmath18 color - temperature relations by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic temperatures have also been determined for 77  stars in our sample by @xcite . in almost all cases",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic temperatures agree , except for several stars where the disagreement may be due to differing metallicities or unresolved binaries ( the temperatures for kic3424541 , 3456181 , 4638884 , 6679371 , 7976303 , 8938364 , 9908400 , 10018963 , 10124866 and 10963065 were found to disagree by more than 3@xmath19 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows a modified hr diagram of this sample , where we have used large separation instead of luminosity .    to measure the value of @xmath0 for each star",
    ", we first determined the frequencies of the @xmath4 modes . where it was possible to resolve the @xmath4 and @xmath12 modes , we measured the frequencies of the @xmath4 modes from the peak in the power spectrum after smoothing .",
    "this was possible for 115 stars .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig1]a .    where it was not possible to resolve the @xmath4 and @xmath12 modes , and therefore not possible to easily determine the correct mode identification , we determined @xmath0 for both scenarios ( 43 stars ) . in this case",
    "we used the frequencies of the ridge centroids , determined from the peaks of the heavily smoothed power spectrum , as shown in an example f star in figure  [ fig1]b .",
    "there were also two cooler stars for which the mode identification was not clear ( kic11401708 and 12555505 ) ; these have low signal - to - noise and the @xmath12 modes are not apparent .    for five stars with blended @xmath4 and @xmath12 modes it was still possible to make an unambiguous mode identification ( kic6064910 ,",
    "6766513 , 7668623 , 7800289 and 8026226 ) . in these stars , avoided crossings ` bump ' the @xmath3 modes from their asymptotically expected position @xcite , revealing the correct identification . in these five cases",
    ", the frequencies were obtained from the centroids of the @xmath5 ridge .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and @xmath0 were obtained from a weighted least - squares fit to the @xmath4 frequencies , as described by @xcite .",
    "the weights were given by a gaussian function centered at the frequency of maximum power , @xmath20 , with a fwhm of @xmath21 . by the asymptotic relation , equation  [ asymp ] , the gradient of this fit is @xmath7 and the y - intercept is @xmath22 .    to confirm the validity of our method of frequency determination , we compared the values of @xmath0 derived from our frequencies to those derived from frequencies that have been determined by more traditional ` peak - bagging ' methods in the 61 stars for which this has been done @xcite .",
    "we found good agreement , with @xmath0 values typically agreeing to within 0.1 , which is approximately the size of the typical uncertainty .",
    "this agreement is of particular importance for hotter stars because using ridge centroids instead of @xmath4 frequencies potentially biases @xmath0 towards slightly lower values .",
    "we found this bias to be negligible within the uncertainties .",
    "in figure  [ fig3]a we show the so - called @xmath0 diagram for the 120 _ kepler _ stars whose mode identifications were unambiguous .",
    "the observed values of @xmath0 are clearly offset to the right of the models which , as mentioned above , arises from the improper modeling of the near - surface layers . from this figure",
    "it appears that the offset in @xmath0 may be roughly the same for all stars , which corresponds to a fixed fraction of the large separation , as was also inferred by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig4]a we show @xmath0 versus @xmath23 for our sample .",
    "the sun is marked in black by its usual symbol , and the stars with unambiguous mode identifications are colored blue .",
    "the trend of decreasing @xmath0 with increasing @xmath16 is clearly seen in these stars .",
    "for the 43 _ kepler _ stars whose mode identifications are uncertain , the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath16 can help . in figure",
    "[ fig4]a these stars are shown in gray for both scenarios .",
    "owing to the potential ambiguity in @xmath1 , each scenario is also plotted shifted by @xmath24 .",
    "we also include both scenarios of the f stars procyon @xcite , hd  49933 @xcite and hd  181420 @xcite .    for most of the stars with ambiguous mode identifications ,",
    "only one of the scenarios lies along the @xmath0@xmath16 trend defined by the stars with secure identifications and we adopt this as the correct one . for the previously studied f stars , we prefer scenario b of procyon @xcite , scenario b of hd  49933 @xcite and scenario 1 of hd  181420 @xcite . due to the width of the @xmath0@xmath16 relation ,",
    "there are a few stars for which the situation is still somewhat ambiguous ( red circles in figure  [ fig4]a ) .",
    "the two scenarios in these stars have values of @xmath0 that fall towards the top and bottom of the relation . for these stars we must use additional information to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "to overcome the spread in the @xmath0@xmath16 relation , the value of @xmath7 is useful . for a given effective temperature , stars with higher masses have smaller values of @xmath7 , as can be seen from the models in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "models also indicate that higher - mass stars have a smaller @xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig3]a and * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that in the @xmath0@xmath16 plane , stars that fall towards the bottom of the trend will be more massive and should therefore have smaller values of @xmath7 than lower - mass stars of similar temperature .",
    "we illustrate this in the @xmath7@xmath0 plane in figure  [ fig3]b , where we show stars in which the identification was already obvious , as well as those for which the identification could be readily made from the @xmath0@xmath16 relation .",
    "symbols are colored according to @xmath16 , with the trend of decreasing @xmath16 with increasing @xmath0 quite clear . the gradual decrease in @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath7 along lines of constant temperature",
    "is also visible . by comparing a star",
    "whose identification is still ambiguous with stars of a similar large separation , we can better make a decision on the identification .",
    "we show the example of kic 11290197 , whose two scenarios are circled in figures  [ fig3]b  and  [ fig4]a . by comparing its @xmath16 with stars of a similar @xmath7 , we establish the preferred scenario , which in this case has the lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "other seismic parameters may also be useful .",
    "the method of @xcite , which uses the value of the small separation @xmath15 , agrees for all stars , except one ( kic5431016 ) , which has a low signal - to - noise .",
    "another very useful parameter is mode linewidth ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , linewidth is strongly correlated with effective temperature , and so there should also be a correlation between linewidth and  @xmath0 .",
    "linewidths for  41 of our stars ( including 12 with ambiguous identifications ) were previously measured by @xcite .",
    "using the syd method described in that paper , we have measured linewidths in a further  26 stars with ambiguous identifications ( excluding the five ambiguous stars with the lowest signal - to - noise ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4]b shows the relation between @xmath25 and @xmath0 for these  67 stars .",
    "we can quantify the likelihood of one scenario over the other by comparing how far each lies from the various relations .",
    "to do so , we first performed a bayesian linear fit to the @xmath0@xmath16 and @xmath0@xmath26 relations for all stars with @xmath27 k with unambiguous identifications ( i.e. the blue points in figures  [ fig4]a and b ) .",
    "for all stars with an uncertain identification , we then calculated the likelihood of obtaining the observed @xmath16 for each of the two possible values of @xmath0 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , the observed @xmath25 , the parameters of the linear fits , and all respective uncertainties , @xmath0 and @xmath26 ; uncertainties for the linear parameters were determined from the marginal posterior of the linear fit . ] .",
    "full details of this method will be provided in a future paper ( m. gruberbauer et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "the required integration over the parameter space was carried out using multinest @xcite .",
    "these two likelihood values , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , were then used to calculate the bayes factor ( ratio of the likelihoods ) , and hence the odds ratio and probability of each scenario , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , assuming equal prior probability for both identifications .",
    "we performed this calculation using both photometric and spectroscopic effective temperatures , where available .",
    "our preferred identification is the one with the greatest probability .",
    "we denote the value of @xmath0 for the preferred identification as @xmath34 , and use @xmath35 for the alternate value .    in table",
    "[ tbl1 ] we list for each star its measured @xmath7 , the value of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath25 , both effective temperatures , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the probabilities , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , of our preferred scenario . for most of the stars we find strong support for our preferred scenario .",
    "one star ( kic1725815 ) , without a measured @xmath37 , is an outlier in the @xmath0@xmath16 plane .",
    "while the linewidth supports one scenario , @xmath36 supports the alternate scenario .",
    "it is not entirely clear which is correct , although the method of @xcite agrees with the alternate scenario favored by @xmath36 .",
    "spectroscopic measurement of the temperature may help resolve this case .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath16 relation for the final selected identification of all stars in our sample is shown in figure  [ fig4]c .",

    "we have presented a method to effectively determine the correct mode identification in stars for which this has previously been a problem .",
    "these are the f stars with large linewidths that make it difficult to distinguish the @xmath4 and @xmath12 modes .",
    "this method uses the relationship between effective temperature , mode linewidth and @xmath0 to determine what values of @xmath0 are reasonable for the star , and therefore which of the two possible scenarios is most likely correct .",
    "this method provides robust results in the vast majority of cases because the value of @xmath0 implied by each scenario is very distinct , even in low signal - to - noise stars , representing a major improvement over previous methods .",
