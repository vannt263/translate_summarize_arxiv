    "the cluster environments of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide important information for improving our understanding of several aspects of the agn phenomenon . over the last fifteen years",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been invested in studying the environments of several different types of agn , including : radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars ( eg .",
    "yee &  green 1984 , 1987 , smith , boyle &  maddox 1995 , 2000 , hall &  green 1998 ) , radio galaxies ( prestage &  peacock 1988 , 1989 , hill &  lilly 1991 ) , bllacs ( wurtz et al .",
    "1997 ) and seyfert galaxies ( de robertis &  yee 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to its potential for shedding light on the processes by which dormant black holes are triggered into agn , the study of clustering environments is an invaluable test of the viability of proposed unification schemes ( eg .",
    "wurtz et al .",
    "1997 ) and models of quasar evolution ( eg .",
    "ellingson , green &  yee 1991 ) . in this paper",
    "we use hst images to study the immediate environments of agn drawn from well - matched samples of powerful radio galaxies ( rg ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlq ) and radio - quiet quasars ( rqq ) at @xmath6 to explore what constraints can be placed on the origin of radio loudness , the viability of radio loud unification , and the physical origin of the dramatic evolution of the quasar population between z = 2.0 and the present day .",
    "several authors have reported a difference in the richness of clustering around radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( eg .",
    "yee & green 1984 , 1987 , ellingson , green &  yee 1991 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that , with substantial overlap , low to moderate redshift radio - loud quasars are found in abell 0/1 clusters , while radio - quiet quasars rarely inhabit clusters as rich as abell 0 .",
    "this apparent change in quasar environment with radio - power was at least consistent with the traditional picture in which rlqs have elliptical host galaxies , and are therefore preferentially found in clusters , while rqqs inhabit the poorer environments associated with lower luminosity disc - dominated seyfert galaxies .    however , the results of our own hst host galaxy imaging programme ( mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "dunlop et al . 2000 ) , together with other recent hst and ground - based studies ( eg .",
    "hooper et al .",
    "1997 , boyce et al .",
    "1998 , bahcall et al .",
    "1997 , schade et al .",
    "2000 ) show that , at the very least , a significant fraction of the rqq population are located in elliptical host galaxies .",
    "in fact , the results of our own study lead to the conclusion that all objects which could be classified as _ true _ quasars ( i.e. m@xmath7 ) will have bulge - dominated host galaxies . in section [ rqq / rlq ]",
    "we therefore examine the question of whether our target rqqs and rlqs , drawn from samples well matched in terms of agn luminosity , are actually occupying significantly different cluster environments .",
    "the other question investigated in this paper is that of the evolution of the cluster environments of powerful , radio - loud agn . with respect to radio galaxies",
    ", it was shown by prestage &  peacock ( 1988 , 1989 ) that at low @xmath8 the environments of powerful frii sources are poorer than their fri counterparts , although the substantial overlap between the two populations led prestage &  peacock to conclude that environment did not solely determine radio luminosity .",
    "in contrast , at higher redshifts , @xmath9 , both yates , miller &  peacock ( 1989 ) and hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) found that radio galaxies inhabited richer clusters than at low redshift , leading hill &  lilly to conclude that the cluster environments of radio galaxies were epoch - dependent .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by ellingson , green &  yee ( 1991 ) from their study of the environments of rlqs .",
    "ellingson et al . found that the environments of rlqs also become richer at @xmath10 , although the existence of this epoch - dependence has recently been questioned by wold et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "in contrast to what might be expected from the results outlined above , the raw hst images from our sample of rgs and rlqs ( dunlop et al .",
    "2000 ) show many of the objects to be apparently residing in clusters of moderate richness , an impression which is confirmed by the analysis presented in section [ ressec ] .",
    "motivated by this , in sections [ hillcomp ] &  [ woldcomp ] we present a comparison between the cluster results for our rg and rlq samples with those for optical and radio luminosity - matched sub - samples of the objects studied by hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) and wold et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , in order to critically re - examine the evidence that rgs and rlqs inhabit environments which are a function of cosmic epoch . in section 6 we investigate whether there is any evidence in our data for a link between agn properties and the large - scale environments of their hosts .",
    "finally , in section [ apm ] we compare the distribution of cluster richness determined for our sample with that of the apm cluster survey ( dalton et al .",
    "1997 , croft et al .",
    "1997 ) in light of the constraint imposed by our host galaxy study that only galaxies with m@xmath11 are capable of producing powerful agn . unless otherwise specified all cosmological calculations performed in this paper assume a cosmology of h@xmath12 , q@xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "the low - redshift sample studied in this paper comprises 44 objects and is a combination of that investigated in our hst study of @xmath1 agn host galaxies ( mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "dunlop et al . 2000 ) , with data of similar quality from the hst archive . the sample investigated in our host - galaxy programme consisted of 33 objects , divided into three sub - samples of 10 radio galaxies ( rg ) , 10 radio - loud quasars ( rlq ) and 13 radio - quiet quasars ( rqq ) .",
    "the unique feature of this sample is that the two quasar sub - samples were originally chosen to be matched in terms of their distribution in the optical luminosity - redshift plane ( m@xmath15 ) ( dunlop et al .",
    "1993 ) , with the rg and rlq sub - samples matched in both the radio power - redshift plane ( p@xmath16 ) , and the radio power - spectral index plane ( p@xmath17 ) ( taylor et al . 1996 ) .",
    "although the selection criteria used in choosing these samples were designed to determine the role played by host galaxies in the radio - loudness dichotomy and radio - loud unification , they are equally valid for investigating the nature of their respective cluster environments .",
    "one of the objects from this sample , the rqq 1549 + 203 , has however been excluded from this analysis due to the known presence of a foreground cluster ( stocke et al .",
    "1983 ) . in order to increase the numbers of objects studied we",
    "have also included in our sample 12 quasars from the hst study of bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which were not included in our host galaxy study .",
    "although image saturation and emission line contamination make the bahcall et al .",
    "data flawed with respect to detailed host galaxy analysis , these problems are not a concern for an environmental study . the data for these objects ( 3 rlqs &  9 rqqs ) is of practically identical depth to our own and , with",
    "the exception of 3c273 , falls in the same region of the m@xmath15 plane .",
    "the observations for all 44 objects considered in this paper were taken with the hst wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "the observations for the 33 objects from our @xmath6 host galaxy study utilised the f675w filter , which closely approximates the standard cousins @xmath18-band ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) , while the data for the objects from the bahcall et al .",
    "sample were taken with the f606w ( wide @xmath19 ) filter .",
    "both data sets were imaged on the wide - field chips of wfpc2 ( wf2 for the f675w data and wf3 for the f606w data ) and have a plate - scale of @xmath20/pix .",
    "the basic data reduction ( bias removal &  flat - fielding ) was performed by the hst pipeline .",
    "subsequently , the individual exposures of each source ( @xmath21s for the f675w data and typically 1100s+600s for the f606w data ) were then combined and cleaned of cosmic rays using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the signal - to - noise levels in the final deep images correspond to a cousins @xmath18-band @xmath22 sensitivity limit of @xmath23 mag arcsec@xmath24 , where the conversion from f606w to cousins @xmath18-band for the bahcall et al .",
    "data assumes a typical colour for a @xmath6 e / sab galaxy of @xmath25 ( fukugita et al .",
    "the method adopted in this study for quantifying the richness of the agn environments was to determine their respective spatial clustering amplitudes ( @xmath0 ) ( longair &  seldner 1979 ) .",
    "this is a standard technique which , although originally designed to investigate clustering around radio galaxies , has subsequently been successfully applied to the environments of a wide variety of active and inactive galaxies ( eg .",
    "yee &  lpez - cruz 1999 , ellingson , yee &  green 1991 , prestage &  peacock 1988 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the derivation of @xmath0 is given in longair &  seldner ( 1979 ) and consequently only a brief outline is provided here .",
    "the first stage in the calculation is the determination of the angular correlation function , defined as : @xmath26 \\delta \\omega\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and a@xmath28 quantifies the excess in the number of galaxies in the vicinity of the source as compared to the expected background contribution n@xmath29 .",
    "provided that @xmath30 the value of a@xmath28 can be directly calculated from the data using the expression : @xmath31\\left(\\frac{3-\\gamma}{2 } \\right)\\theta^{\\gamma-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the total number of galaxies counted within a radius of @xmath33 radians from the target ( excluding the target itself ) , and @xmath34 is the expected number of background galaxies within the same radius . in order to directly compare the clustering around objects which cover a range of redshifts it is then necessary to de - project this angular correlation into its spatial equivalent which is defined by : @xmath35\\delta v\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath0 is the desired spatial clustering amplitude . by invoking the simplifying assumption that the clustering of galaxies is spherically symmetric around the central object it can be shown ( longair & seldner 1979 ) that the spatial and angular clustering amplitudes are related by the expression : @xmath37^{\\gamma-3 } \\label{bequn}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the effective angular diameter distance to the target and @xmath39 is the integrated field - galaxy luminosity function at the redshift of the target",
    "the quantity @xmath40 is a constant which has a value of @xmath41 for the canonical field - galaxy value of @xmath42 ( groth &  peebles 1977 ) .    for a galaxy appearing on the same wf ccd as one of the agn in this sample to be counted as a possible cluster member it had to satisfy two criteria .",
    "firstly , its projected distance from the central object had to be less than the counting radius ; defined as the distance of the central object from the nearest edge of the ccd . at the sample median redshift of z=0.2",
    "this radius corresponds to a projected metric radius of typically 180 kpc .",
    "although this is undoubtedly a small counting radius compared to the usual 500 kpc or 1 mpc counting radii adopted in most cluster studies , provided that the clustering of galaxies around the agn does have a slope of @xmath42 , the restriction of only having information of the central regions of the clusters should not prevent a reliable determination of the enhancement of associated galaxies relative to the field population .",
    "indeed , as will be discussed in section [ corrslope ] , there is good evidence that the clustering around the agn studied here does follow the expected slope of @xmath42 , at least on average . furthermore , in their recent study of low-@xmath8 abell clusters , yee &  lpez - cruz ( 1999 ) found that reducing the counting radius from 1 mpc to 200 kpc only altered the spatial clustering amplitude determination at the 10 percent level .",
    "the second selection criterion was that galaxies had to lie in the magnitude interval @xmath43 , where m@xmath44 is the apparent magnitude corresponding to m@xmath44 at the agn redshift .",
    "this magnitude interval is a compromise which is designed to include those cluster galaxies which contain the majority of the cluster mass .",
    "the faint limit of m@xmath45 should probe deep enough into the cluster luminosity function to be sensitive to any enhancements in galaxy density , without risking the possibility of missing clusters due to the background galaxy counts rising more rapidly than the faint - end of the cluster luminosity function at @xmath46 .",
    "the bright limit of m@xmath47 is set to avoid problems associated with small number statistics , although relaxation of this limit to m@xmath48 has a negligible effect on the results presented in section [ ressec ] . an additional advantage with",
    "this choice of magnitude interval is that , due to the host galaxies of the agn studied in our hst imaging programme having average luminosities one magnitude brighter than m@xmath44 ( dunlop et al .",
    "2000 ) , this interval typically corresponds to the m@xmath49m@xmath50 range adopted for the abell - type calculation of cluster richness around @xmath51 radio galaxies by hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) .",
    "the comparison presented in section [ hillcomp ] of the clustering around the @xmath1 radio galaxies studied here , with the results obtained by hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) , can consequently be performed in a more transparent manner .      .the",

    "the clustering results for the radio galaxy and radio - loud quasars sub - samples presented in the previous section offer an opportunity to re - examine the evidence for an epoch - dependent change in cluster richness at @xmath54 . in this section",
    "we investigate this issue by comparing our results with those published for radio galaxies by hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) and the recent work on radio - loud quasars by wold et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .      in their study of the environments of radio galaxies hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) studied four groups of @xmath55 objects at @xmath51 , each of which were equally spaced in radio power from log p@xmath56 whz@xmath57 . to compare their results with those for our radio galaxy sample we selected objects from their two medium radio luminosity groups , subject to the redshift constraint @xmath58 , which was chosen to match the range in redshift displayed by our radio galaxies ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this selection procedure produced 16 objects , two of which were quasars and subsequently rejected to leave a final sample of 14 objects .",
    "the p@xmath60m@xmath61 and p@xmath62 distributions of the hill &  lilly sub - sample and our radio galaxy sample are shown in the left and middle panels of fig [ hill_comb ] .",
    "the two samples are clearly well matched , with the two - dimensional ks test ( 2dks ) showing their respective p@xmath60m@xmath61 distributions to be statistically indistinguishable ( @xmath63 ) .    to facilitate a comparison between the cluster richness determinations of hill & lilly and our own results it was necessary to transform between @xmath0 and their @xmath64 values .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is the background subtracted number of galaxies within a radius of 0.5 mpc , in the magnitude range @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the apparent magnitude of the radio galaxy . as previously mentioned in section [ spam ] , this magnitude range should be well matched to our choice of m@xmath67m@xmath45 , and to make the transformation we have used hill &  lilly s own determination of @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting @xmath69 distributions for the two samples are shown in the right - hand panel of fig [ hill_comb ] .",
    "it can be seen that the two distributions are very similar , an impression confirmed by a ks test ( @xmath70 ) , with no indication that the members of the low-@xmath8 sample inhabit poorer environments , or that they display a smaller range in environment richness .",
    "although we are dealing with small samples , this result demonstrates that , at least for these two well matched samples , there appears little evidence for a epoch - dependent change in frii radio galaxy environments at @xmath51 . in light of this ,",
    "we now move on to look for a change in the environments of radio - loud quasars with redshift .",
    "the recently published study of 21 rlqs in the redshift interval @xmath71 by wold et al .",
    "( 2000a ) provides a good opportunity for comparison with the results from our @xmath1 rlq sample .",
    "wold et al .",
    "also classify the environments of their quasars via the spatial clustering amplitude and their results can therefore be directly compared to our own .",
    "taken as a whole the results for their sample are in excellent agreement with our own , with their mean figure of @xmath72 mpc@xmath73 being almost identical to our mean of @xmath74 mpc@xmath73 .    to disentangle the effects of redshift and radio luminosity",
    "we have excluded the 7 most radio luminous of the wold et al .",
    "sample ( log p@xmath75 whz@xmath57sr@xmath57 ) to leave a sub - sample of 14 objects which are well matched to our 12-object rlq sample .",
    "the distribution of the two samples on the p@xmath76m@xmath61 and p@xmath77 planes is shown in the left - hand and middle panels of fig [ wold_comb ] .",
    "the two samples can be seen to be well matched , with the 2dks test returning a probability of @xmath78 that the two samples are drawn from the same p@xmath76m@xmath61 distribution . from the comparison of the spatial clustering amplitudes of the two samples shown in the right - hand panel of fig [ wold_comb ] ,",
    "there is again no suggestion that the high-@xmath8 sample displays systematically higher values of @xmath0 , although it is noticeable that the scatter in @xmath0 is somewhat higher in the high-@xmath8 sample .",
    "this is in fact the conclusion arrived at by wold et al . , who also found no evidence for an epoch - dependent change in rlq environments when comparing their results with those of ellingson , yee &  green ( 1991 ) at low redshift .",
    "in this section we explore whether there is any evidence in our data for a link between agn properties and the large - scale environments of their hosts .",
    "this issue is of interest because it offers the potential to determine whether the radio and optical luminosity of powerful agn are primarily influenced by large - scale environmental factors such as density of the icm and galaxy interactions , or alternatively , whether the physical properties of the active nucleus itself , such as black - hole mass and accretion rate , are the dominant influence .",
    "the three panels shown in fig [ spamcor ] display the relationship between @xmath0 and respectively , estimated central black - hole mass , quasar accretion efficiency and radio luminosity .",
    "all three panels feature only those objects from the sample imaged in the mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) host - galaxy study in order to produce a homogeneous data - set . the objects from the bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample have been excluded on the basis that , due to the saturated nature of their data , reliable nuclear luminosities are unavailable .    in the left - hand panel of fig [ spamcor ] we have plotted @xmath0 against black - hole mass , as calculated by a straight application of the galaxy bulge mass - blackhole mass relation published by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to the host galaxy modelling results presented in dunlop et al .",
    "a general trend for black - hole mass to increase with spatial clustering amplitude can be seen , although the correlation is not statistically significant , with a spearman rank test returning a probability of @xmath79 of no correlation .",
    "the clearest signal comes from the ten radio galaxies , although even here kendall s tau test still returns only a marginally significant result ; @xmath80 .",
    "however , the lack of a clear correlation between @xmath0 and black - hole mass is perhaps not entirely unexpected .",
    "even if the basic form of the cluster luminosity function does not change significantly with cluster richness , there will be a corresponding increase in the number of luminous , bulge - dominated galaxies which are capable of hosting powerful agn as cluster richness increases .",
    "consequently , in rich clusters , it is not only the central brightest - cluster galaxy which is a potential agn host , but also the next few lower - ranked cluster galaxies .",
    "this then will inevitably introduce significant horizontal scatter into the @xmath0-blackhole mass relation , regardless of the 0.5 dex scatter in the magorrian relation itself .",
    "the middle panel of fig [ spamcor ] shows the relationship between @xmath0 and the nuclear luminosity of the quasars , expressed as a fraction of their eddington limit , under the assumption of a central black - hole mass as predicted by the magorrian relation . as with the previous plot ,",
    "a trend can be seen for the eddington fraction to increase with cluster richness , although again this is not statistically significant , with a rank test returning a probability of @xmath81 that no correlation is present .",
    "however , it is perhaps interesting to note that the three rqqs which are radiating closest to their predicted eddington limit are also ranked first , second and fourth in terms of their cluster richness .",
    "finally , the right - hand panel of fig [ spamcor ] examines whether there is a correlation between the radio luminosity of the radio - loud agn in our sample , and the density of the enviroment into which their radio jets are expanding . as with the other two plots in fig [ spamcor ] a positive correlation",
    "is again suggested to the eye , but is once more found not to be significant , with a rank test returning a probability of @xmath82 of no correlation , even after the removal of the obvious outlying radio galaxy .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the apparent positive trend between radio luminosity and @xmath0 is entirely defined by the ten radio galaxies , with the rlqs showing no evidence for a connection between radio luminosity and cluster richness .",
    "consequently , at least for this sample of objects , there appears no real evidence that the density of a radio - loud agn s cluster environment plays the dominant role in determining its radio luminosity .",
    "however , it is also clear that the limited dynamic range of this sample , combined with the inherently large uncertainties associated with spatial clustering amplitudes , means that the results presented here are still perfectly consistent with a weak correlation being present .",
    "in section [ change ] it was shown that with samples of rqqs and rlqs which are carefully matched in terms of optical luminosity there is no evidence that rqqs occupy systematically lower - density cluster environments .",
    "this result therefore makes it of interest to re - examine the question of whether quasars actually avoid rich clusters , as sometimes claimed , or if alternatively the apparent lack of quasars in rich clusters is simply a reflection of the fact that rich clusters are relatively scarce .    in order to address this question",
    "we have compared our cluster results with cluster number counts from the apm survey , which are well modelled by a power - law with slope @xmath83 ( dalton et al .",
    "1997 ) . to allow a fair comparison of the relative numbers of clusters it is necessary to correct for the fact that the number of potential agn host galaxies increases with cluster richness . to allow for this effect",
    "we make the assumption that the galaxy population of all our clusters can be described by a schechter function with constant characteristic magnitude and faint - end slope , and a normalization simply proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , in fig [ apmfig ] we have simply weighted the relative number counts of clusters by the inverse of the mean @xmath0 in each bin . as can be seen in fig [ apmfig ]",
    "this simple correction naturally produces number counts which are perfectly consistent with the power - law found by the apm survey .",
    "a further interesting result arises if one considers the space densities of clusters from the apm survey as calculated by croft et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . with the calibration that in the scheme used in the analysis of the apm survey , a cluster of richness r=40 corresponds to roughly abell class 0 ( ie .",
    "@xmath84 mpc@xmath73 ) , it is possible to extrapolate the figures provided by croft et al .",
    "to estimate that the space density of all clusters richer than r@xmath85 is @xmath86 mpc@xmath87 .",
    "if one allows for the fact that up to 50% of quasars could be obscured in the optical - uv by a dusty torus , this abundance of clusters is in reasonable agreement with the peak space density of quasars at @xmath5 ( warren , hewett &  osmer 1994 ) .",
    "this line of argument leads to an interesting conclusion concerning the fraction of massive cluster galaxies which were active at @xmath5 . in their photometric study of 83 abell clusters",
    "schneider , gunn &  hoessel ( 1983 ) determined the absolute magnitudes of the three brightest galaxies in each cluster .",
    "when converted to our cosmology , the mean magnitude of the first ranked galaxy in clusters of abell class 0 corresponds to @xmath88 , where a colour of @xmath89 has been assumed ( fukugita et al .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the figure of @xmath90 which was found to be the necessary bulge luminosity for a galaxy to host a powerful ( @xmath91 ) quasar by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . furthermore , because the mean luminosity found by schneider , gunn &  hoessel for the second ranked galaxy in abell class 0 clusters was approximately one magnitude fainter than that of the first ranked galaxies , we can conclude that the average number of massive elliptical galaxies in a abell class 0 cluster which are capable of hosting a powerful quasar is close to unity .",
    "consequently , because of the steep decline in the number of clusters with increasing richness ( fig [ apmfig ] ) , the close agreement between the peak space density of quasars and that of clusters of abell class @xmath92 leads to the conclusion that virtually all massive cluster ellipticals were active at @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion is unaffected by the fact that the very richest clusters may have contained 4 or 5 active galaxies at this epoch because the rarity of such clusters means that they have a negligible affect on quasar numbers .",
    "the cluster environments of a matched sample of 44 powerful radio - loud and radio - quiet agn at @xmath93 have been analysed using the spatial clustering amplitude method .",
    "the three main conclusions arising from this study can be summarized as follows :    firstly , we find no evidence to suggest that rqqs inhabit poorer cluster environments than rlqs or rgs .",
    "all three classes of agn are located in environments which , on average , are comparable to abell class 0 , although there is a large amount of scatter .",
    "secondly , by comparing our results with those for samples from hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) and wold et al . (",
    "2000a ) which are matched in terms of redshift and radio luminosity , we have re - examined the evidence for an epoch - dependent change in the environments of rlqs and rgs .",
    "we find no evidence that the environments of rgs and rlqs become significantly richer at @xmath51 as has been reported by hill &  lilly ( 1991 ) and ellingson , yee &  green ( 1991 ) respectively .    finally , via comparison with the apm cluster survey",
    "we conclude that the distribution of agn cluster environments is consistent with having being drawn at random from the general cluster distribution . furthermore , because the cluster population is dominated by clusters of abell class @xmath4 which , on average , only contain one galaxy capable of hosting a powerful quasar , we argue that the close agreement between the space density of clusters and the peak space density of quasars at @xmath5 suggests that practically all massive cluster ellipticals were active at this epoch . in this scenario ,",
    "the apparent lack of powerful agn in rich clusters at the present day simply reflects the comparative scarcity of high density environments .",
