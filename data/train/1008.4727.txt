    "these quasi - persistent systems are particularly interesting as during the long outbursts the crust should be heated out of thermal equilibrium with the rest of the star @xcite .",
    "thus , once the source returns to quiescence , the crust thermally relaxes .",
    "the resulting cooling curve depends on a number of key properties of the crust including the composition and structure of the crust @xcite , and the crust thickness ( which is dependent on the mass and radius of the star , * ? ? ?",

    "ks  1731@xmath0260 was in outburst for 12.5 years , returning to quiescence in 2001 @xcite . for a detailed history of this source , see @xcite .",
    "it was quickly realized that such a long outburst should allow for observable crustal cooling , hence , a monitoring campaign using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ followed @xcite .",
    "a cooling curve covering the first @xmath1 years of quiescence was presented by @xcite .",
    "the source flux initially dropped rapidly : a factor of @xmath22.5 during the first year in quiescence and a factor of @xmath3 in the first 1000 days @xcite .",
    "the cooling curve was well fit by either an exponential decay to a constant level or a simple power - law decay @xcite . the rapid rate of cooling and the inferred cold temperature of the neutron star core , led to conclusions that the crust must have a high thermal conductivity and required enhanced levels of core cooling @xcite based on comparing with the theoretical cooling models of @xcite .",
    "motivated by these cooling curves , theoretical crust cooling models for ks  1731@xmath0260were calculated by @xcite .",
    "these authors rule out a low thermal conductivity for the crust , but do not require enhanced core cooling .",
    "@xcite also calculated thermal relaxation models for neutron star crusts , finding a high thermal conductivity for the crust , and a low impurity parameter ( i.e. , the dispersion in the charge of the ions in the crust is low ) .    here , we present a new _ chandra _ observation of ks  1731@xmath0260 , performed @xmath4 years after the end of the outburst , and 4 years since the previous _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the data are consistent with further cooling of the neutron star , continuing along a power - law decay .",
    "the newest _ chandra _ observation of ks  1731@xmath0260 was performed in two separate pointings .",
    "one 31 ks segment was performed on 2009 may 17 ( obsid : 10037 ) and the other 28 ks segment was performed on 2009 may 19 ( obsid : 10911 ) .",
    "the source was at the default aimpoint on the acis - s3 chip , which was operated in faint mode .",

    "here , we assume a distance of 7 kpc @xcite , i.e. normalization = @xmath9 pc@xmath10 .",
    "as we showed for mxb  1659@xmath029 in @xcite , the distance assumed only shifts the fitted temperatures up or down , and does not affect the cooling timescales derived . here ,",
    "if we assume a distance of 5 kpc , the temperatures are all about 10% lower than for @xmath11 kpc , where as if we assume @xmath12 kpc then the temperatures are approximately 7% higher than for @xmath11 kpc .",

    "the neutron star atmosphere effective temperature is allowed to vary between epochs . for the first _ xmm - newton _ observations ( 013795201/013795301 ) the two sets of spectra had their parameters tied between the spectra .",

    "[ fig : hid ] we show a hardness - intensity diagram that displays the evolution of this color with the full 0.5  10 kev count rate .",
    "we also show the predicted color and count rate evolution for three different spectral models : ( i ) a neutron star atmosphere , ( ii ) a neutron star atmosphere plus power - law model where the power - law always contributes 20% to the unabsorbed 0.5  10 kev flux ( we assume a spectral index , @xmath39 ) , ( iii ) a neutron star atmosphere plus power - law ( @xmath39 ) model where the power - law flux always contributes 40% of the unabsorbed 0.5  10 kev flux ( note that all three models assume galactic absorption of @xmath40 cm@xmath10 ) .",
    "the data points are most consistent with a simple cooling neutron star atmosphere , but , model ( ii ) where there is a small contribution from a power - law can not be ruled out .",
    "any power - law contribution increases the color ( for a given count rate ) compared to the color from a neutron star atmosphere only . a harder power - law spectrum ( with a slope closer to 1 than 2 )",
    "would also lead to an increased color .",
    "thus , any contributions from a power - law component must be at a low level ( less than a few tens of percent )",
    ". therefore , there must still be significant neutron star cooling .",
    "also note that this count rate analysis does not take into account any change in the effective area of the detector over time .",
    "there has been a known increase in contaminant on the _ chandra _ acis detector since the mission launch , leading to a decrease in the sensitivity at lowest energies over time @xcite .",
    "this would artificially harden the color used here , thus the colors shown here should be taken as maximum values .    to further test the affect of a constant fraction of power - law flux",

    "the resulting temperatures still follow a simple power - law decay cooling curve , with the same slope as before .",

    "these calculations by @xcite suggest that the lightcurve of a cooling crust is expected to be a broken power - law which flattens to a constant at late times , set by the temperature of the neutron star core .",

    "the power - law break occurs when there is a transition in the solid from a classical to quantum crystal at a depth close to neutron drip .",
    "the time of this power - law break is set by the thermal diffusion time to the depth of this transition . in these models",
    "the three variable parameters are ( i ) the crust impurity parameter which is given by @xmath57 and measures the dispersion in the charge of the nuclides ( @xmath58 ) in the crust , ( ii ) the core temperature , @xmath59 and ( iii ) the temperature at the top of the crust , @xmath60 . the best - fitting model ( dotted line in fig  [ fig : coolingcurve ] )",

    "these values are quite similar to the best - fit in @xcite who found @xmath66 , @xmath67 k , and @xmath68 k. thus , the core temperature here is slightly colder and the impurity parameter in the crust is slightly higher than the previous best - fitting values .",
    "we have presented a new _ chandra _ observation of the neutron star low - mas x - ray binary ks  1731@xmath0260 in quiescence .",
    "this observation extends the monitoring of this source to approximately 8 years after the end of the most recent outburst .",
    "the observation suggests that the neutron star has continued to cool with an effective temperature ( for an observer at infinity ) of @xmath69 ev compared to the preceding epoch where @xmath43 ev .",
    "previously , the cooling curve could be well fit by both a power - law decay or an exponential decay to a constant level @xcite . here",
    ", we find that the latest observation remains on the simple power - law decay with a slope of @xmath70 , indicating that the crust may be continuing to cool and has not yet reached thermal equilibrium with the core . as has been discussed previously @xcite , the cooling of ks  1731@xmath0260 indicates a crust with high thermal conductivity .",
    "this implies that the crust has a low impurity parameter , in other words , the dispersion in the charge of the ions in the crust is low ( * ? ? ?",
    "* find @xmath71 is a robust upper limit ) .",
    "one potential problem is that the spectrum may not be purely thermal , but that there could also be some contribution from non - thermal power - law emission that can not be detected due to low number of counts in the spectra .",
    "recent observations of another cooling neutron star xte  j1701@xmath0462 have shown an increase in flux for approximately 100 days on top of a cooling curve , likely due to increased levels of residual accretion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , long - term monitoring of the neutron star transient cen  x-4 in quiescence has shown variability in the thermal component that can not be explained by crustal cooling , and may also be linked to residual accretion during quiescence @xcite .",
    "the monitoring of ks  1731@xmath0260 is relatively sparse ( only 8 observations over 8 years ) and thus any increase in flux similar to xte  j1701@xmath0462 could easily have been missed .",
    "however , only the first observation of ks  1731@xmath0260 shows a significant detection above 3 kev , and in this observation @xcite found that the contribution of the power - law was limited to about 15% of the flux , though the power - law component was not statistically required to fit the spectrum . in order to investigate the potential contribution from power - law emission , we created a hardness - intensity diagram using only the _ chandra _ count rates in different bands .",
    "the data are consistent with a cooling neutron star atmosphere , though a small contribution ( a few tens of percent ) from a power - law component can not be excluded .    from a theoretical perspective , it is puzzling that the decay is best - fit by a single power law .",
    "numerical simulations of crustal cooling expect that the lightcurve should approximate a broken power - law which flattens to a constant at late times @xcite .",
    "the break in the power - law is caused by a change from classical to quantum crystals , and the timescale on which this occurs is set by the thermal diffusion time to the depth of this transition .",
    "though in ks  1731@xmath0260 we only see a single , unbroken power - law decay in the lightcurve , fitting the model of @xcite allows for quantitative constraints on the thermal conductivity of the crust .",
    "the best - fitting model gives an impurity parameter @xmath72 and core temperature @xmath62 k ( note that these values are for a fixed mass and radius , and any increase in the surface gravity shortens the cooling time by decreasing the crust thickness ) .",
    "the impurity parameter is marginally higher and the core temperature is slightly lower than the best - fitting values in @xcite . the additional _ chandra _ observation requires a lower core temperature to fit the lightcurve at late times , where as the impurity parameter needs to be increased to maintain the thermal cooling timescale ( a lower core temperature increases the thermal conductivity and thus increasing the impurity parameter compensates ) .",
    "the implied core temperature only requires standard models for core cooling without enhanced levels on neutrino cooling @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a power - law decay with a slope of 1/8 ( as observed here ) is expected for thermal relaxation of the core by enhanced neutrino emission ( i.e. , the rate goes as @xmath73 , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a scenario requires the core to be heated up substantially during an outburst .",
    "however , in order to do this , or to cool the core over the observed timescale , would require a core specific heat several orders of magnitude smaller than that provided by degenerate electrons , assuming an electron fraction of order 0.1 .",
