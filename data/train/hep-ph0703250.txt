    "it is known that the standard model of elementary particle physics has many free yukawa couplings .",
    "the texture - zeros was considered as an approach to reduce the number of the yukawa couplings . by this approach , predictions among observable values are obtained .",
    "due to useful features of the texture - zeros , many authors have studied the texture - zeros@xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , an origin of zero elements of mass matrices are not known .",
    "namely , such zeros have often been assumed by hand .",
    "our paper proposes a new approach to solve this problem and some models are considered by @xmath11 flavor symmetry @xcite or discrete flavor symmetry @xcite .    in our model",
    ", we take the discrete flavor symmetry approach . flavor symmetry is expected to be a clue to understand the masses and mixing angles of quarks and leptons .",
    "it reduces the number of free parameters in yukawa couplings such as the texture - zeros and some testable predictions of masses and mixing angles generally follow .",
    "some predictive models with discrete flavor symmetries have been explored by many authors @xcite-@xcite.we consider a @xmath0 group as the discrete symmetry because @xmath0 group is the simplest discrete non - abelian group .",
    "@xmath0 is a permutation group of three objects .    in this paper , we discuss the mass matrix of quarks and leptons in the case that @xmath12 doublet higgs fields have non - trivial @xmath0 flavor charges .",
    "then , we discuss a dynamical realization of the texture - zeros . in previous models ,",
    "some yukawa couplings are restricted by discrete flavor symmetry and then some favored textures(texture - zeros ) are obtained by changing basis",
    ". however , there is another possibility to obtain zero matrix elements .",
    "this is vanishing higgs vev .",
    "this possibility , however , does not make sense if a model contains only one higgs field .",
    "therefore , we introduce some higgs fields .",
    "we perform the analysis of higgs potential at the electroweak scale and examine whether some of higgs fields in the flavor basis have vanishing expectation values . vanishing elements(texture - zeros ) of fermion",
    "mass matrices are obtained dynamically in the vacuum of the theory , and their positions are controlled by the flavor symmetry .",
    "an interesting point of the scheme is that , due to the @xmath0 group structure , the up and down quark mass matrices automatically have different forms at the vacuum , which lead to non - vanishing generation mixing .",
    "it is found that the exact @xmath0 model has nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "however , these disappear by introducing @xmath0 soft breaking terms and it is showed that these terms have no effect on predictions of the exact @xmath0 model . generally speaking , @xmath0 soft breaking terms give rise to changing conditions necessary to take a favored vacuum .",
    "however , @xmath0 soft breaking terms introduced in our model do not generate conditions for a favored vacuum . as a prediction for a unitary matrix element @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 .",
    "this will be tested in future experiments such as the double chooz .",
    "the suppression of fcnc mediated by multiple higgs fields will also be discussed .",
    "in this section , the @xmath2 invariant mass matrices are presented@xcite .",
    "we consider a supersymmetric theory and both left - handed and right - handed fermions transform under a single @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "@xmath0 has three irreducible representations , a singlet , a pseudo singlet and a doublet .",
    "we suppose that two of three generations belong to @xmath2 doublets and the others are singlets .",
    "namely , @xmath0 doublet is assigned to matter superfield of first and second generation,@xmath15 and @xmath16 . then , the most general supersymmetric yukawa mass terms are obtained as @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 are independent yukawa coupling constants . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath0 doublet higgs , @xmath22 is @xmath0 pseudo singlet higgs and @xmath23 is @xmath0 singlet higgs .",
    "( [ dirac mass ] ) is obtained by using a decomposition of a tensor product of @xmath2 doublet , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which is given as @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "now we assign @xmath28 to third generation temporarily .",
    "we reconfigure this assignment later .    the @xmath0 invariant bare majorana mass matrix for matter superfield @xmath29(@xmath30 )",
    "is given as @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 are majorana masses .",
    "in our model we consider eight higgs bosons : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are @xmath12 weak doublet .",
    "our purpose in this section is to discuss whether or not there are some vanishing vev patterns with no parameter relations . @xmath0 invariant potential is given as @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the antisymmetric tensor , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) are the holomorphic and non - holomorphic mass parameters of supersymmetry breaking , respectively .",
    "the d - terms are explicitly given by @xmath50 with @xmath51(@xmath52 ) is the @xmath53 generators .",
    "hence , we analyze eight equations at vacuum : @xmath54 where the quantities @xmath55 are the absolute values of the neutral higgs scalars , @xmath56 and the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been chosen to be real and positive using field redefinitions .",
    "@xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are gauge couplings of @xmath64 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    ".all possible minima of the scalar potential for @xmath2 singlet and doublet higgs fields without tuning of lagrangian parameters for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the blank entries denote non - vanishing vevs . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is therefore reasonable to softly break the flavor symmetry within the scalar potential . we introduce the following supersymmetry - breaking soft terms which do not break phenomenological characters of the exact @xmath2 model . @xmath65 a @xmath0 soft breaking model have the same phenomenological characters as the exact @xmath2 model and we can take the vev pattern ( [ vev ] ) with no parameter condition .",
    "the @xmath0 soft breaking model also predicts a lightest higgs mode .",
    "this is similar to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) .",
    "we obtain the neutral higgs masses squared approximately : @xmath66 the other three mass eigenvalues squared take the complicated forms .",
    "then , we make the simplifying assumption @xmath67 with the hierarchy @xmath68 . hence , we obtain a lightest mode which has a weak scale mass @xmath69 and its eigenvector is given as @xmath70    = 9.0 cm",
    "since there are multiple electroweak doublet higgs bosons which couple to matter fields , flavor - changing processes are mediated at classical level by these higgs fields .",
    "we can show that flavor - changing process at classical level leads to all but one higgs masses which are order of supersymmetric breaking scale .",
    "therefore , the experimental observations of fcnc rare events would show a bound on the supersymmetry breaking scale . among various experimental constraints , we find the most important constraint comes from the neutral k meson mixing .",
    "for the heavy higgs modes , the tree - level @xmath73 mass difference @xmath74 is given by the matrix element of the effective hamiltonian between k mesons@xcite .",
    "@xmath74 includes @xmath75 , which is an average of the higgs masses @xmath76 , and a free parameter @xmath77 is given as @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the down type quark yukawa couplings .",
    "it is found from fig .",
    "[ ratio ] that heavy higgs masses are bounded from below so as to suppress the extra higgs contribution compared with the standard model one .",
    "@xmath81 is roughly given by @xmath82 where we took @xmath83 and @xmath84 as typical values .",
    "we used the experimental values @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and took @xmath87 as a typical electroweak scale .",
    "the mass matrix of quarks and leptons have discussed in view of @xmath0 flavor symmetry approach . we have analyzed the structure of the higgs scalar potential and examined possible vanishing elements of quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "then , there exists the most favored vev pattern for which parameter conditions are not necessary and quark and lepton mass matrices from the vev pattern is consistent with experimental data .",
    "@xmath0 assignment to the flavor can be embedded in the @xmath88 grand unification and we take non - trivial @xmath0 assignment . as phenomenological results ,",
    "a prediction for the lepton mixing @xmath13 is obtained : @xmath1 .",
    "this prediction will be tested in future experiments .",
    "it is found from tree - level fcnc processes mediated by the higgs bosons that tev scale typical higgs mass is consistent with @xmath71-@xmath72 mixing experimental bound .",
