    "amorphous chalcogenides ( particularly the sulfides , selenides and tellurides ) exhibit intriguing physical properties that are not observed in their crystalline counterparts .",
    "some of these unusual properties are extensively used in electronic and photonic devices @xcite and there are many potential applications .",
    "perhaps the most interesting opto - electronic behavior of these materials is the metastable structural changes resulting from the absorption of near - bandgap light @xcite .",
    "the microscopic changes in the atomic structure involved are not generally observable directly , but they are reflected in measurable optical , electronic , and mechanical properties @xcite . a fully consistent microscopic theory accounting for the opto - electronic behavior in chalcogenide glasses , however , is still lacking .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to employ computer simulations in order to generate and study structural models of such materials .",
    "provided that these computer - generated models compare well with available experimental data , they could allow one to monitor the photo - induced structural changes in the greatest possible detail at the microscopic level .",
    "needless to say , such detailed information is not generally presently available from experiments .    in order to study opto - electronic effects , one needs to perform quantum - mechanical calculations that are very time consuming .",
    "this imposes a severe constraint on the accessible system size of the simulated models .",
    "it is possible , however , that small samples may be sufficient to capture much of the interesting photoinduced behavior due to a high degree of localization of the photo - excited electron - hole pairs @xcite .",
    "a few _ ab initio _ studies of amorphous chalcogenides , paying particular attention to electronic properties , have been performed by drabold and co - workers ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "although their results agree well with experimental data , the defect concentration in these structural models is much greater than is estimated in experiments .",
    "some of the possible reasons for this are the level of approximation in the _ ab initio _ approach employed in these studies and/or the model preparation history , which may have resulted in too many quenched - in defects due to very rapid cooling of the sample from the liquid state .    in this paper",
    ", we use a density - functional - based tight - binding ( dftb ) method @xcite in order to generate and analyze several models of amorphous diarsenic trisulphide ( a - as@xmath0s@xmath1 ) with a controlled and systematic change in the defect concentration .",
    "apart from being widely regarded as the canonical chalcogenide glass , this particular material was chosen for analysis for the following reasons .",
    "first , we have obtained reliable high - quality neutron - scattering structural data for this material @xcite .",
    "second , the properties of a - as@xmath0s@xmath1 are expected to be similar to those of a - as@xmath0se@xmath1 , amorphous diarsenic triselenide , that have been studied theoretically in ref .  , and it is of interest to corroborate this similarity in independent simulations .",
    "third , the necessary input dftb data for sulphur have been previously generated and extensively tested @xcite .",
    "although the dftb method is semiempirical , it allows one to improve upon the standard tight - binding description of interatomic interactions by including a dft - based self - consistent second order in charge fluctuation ( scc ) correction to the total energy . the flexibility in choosing the desired accuracy while computing the interatomic forces brings about the possibility to perform much faster calculations when high precision is not required , and refine the result if needed .",
    "the scc - dftb model is derived from density - functional theory ( dft ) by a second - order expansion of the dft total energy functional with respect to the charge - density fluctuations @xmath2 around a given reference density @xmath3 :    @xmath4 - \\int v_{xc}[n_0]n_0 + e_{ii } , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is expressed by @xmath6 . here ,",

    "analytic first derivatives for the calculation of interatomic forces are readily obtained , and second derivatives of the energy with respect to atomic positions are calculated numerically .",

    "first , dft calculations have to be performed for the neutral atom to determine the lcao basis functions @xmath42 and the reference densities @xmath43 . here",

    ", we used the same tabulated data set for sulphur - sulphur interactions as in ref .  , and the as - as , as - s and s - as data sets were generated according to the procedure outlined above .",
    "the confinement radii for the as pseudoatomic densities ( r@xmath47 = 9.8  a.u . and",
    "r@xmath48 = 4.5  a.u . ) , as well as the as - as repulsive pair - potential were determined in accord with other ongoing efforts related to gaas systems .",
    "the cage - like as@xmath49s@xmath50 molecule was used to calculate the as - s repulsive pair potential , so that after finding the minimum energy configuration of the molecule in all - electron dft - lda calculations using the nrlmol program @xcite , a regular scaling of the as - s bond - lengths was performed , keeping the overall t@xmath47 symmetry .",
    "then the acquired potentials were tested on other clusters , such as as@xmath0s and as@xmath49s@xmath49 molecules , with an overall good agreement of the binding energies and configurations between scc - dftb and the reference all - electron dft - lda nrlmol results . when these data sets were used in order to optimize the geometry of the crystal structure of orpiment ( c - as@xmath0s@xmath1 ) in scc - dftb ,",
    "the agreement with the experimental structure @xcite was within 2% .      in experiments ,",
    "bulk glasses are usually prepared from the melt by rapidly cooling ( quenching ) the sample .",
    "although it appears impossible to achieve experimentally realistic cooling rates in molecular - dynamics computer simulations , some empirical procedures result in models that can be in good agreement with experiments . in order to prepare realistic models of a - as@xmath0s@xmath1 , we use an algorithm akin to that used , e.g. , in refs",
    "the structural model of a - as@xmath0s@xmath1 was obtained in the course of an @xmath51 ( constant number of particles , @xmath52 , volume , @xmath53 , and temperature , @xmath54 ) molecular - dynamics simulation with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since we are not interested in statistical properties of thermal fluctuations , the temperature was controlled simply by scaling the velocities of the constituent particles every few time steps with the time intervals between the scalings taken randomly with a mean value of 10 time steps .",
    "we used a time step of 100 a.u .",
    "@xmath55 2.4 fs ( 1 a.u .",
    "= 2.4189@xmath56 s ) and the verlet algorithm in order to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "the starting configuration was a system of 200 ( 80 arsenic and 120 sulphur ) atoms in a cubic supercell , with a side length of 17.25   , obtained by rescaling a crystalline configuration of orpiment ( monoclinic , space group 14 , p12@xmath57/n1 ) with @xmath58 20-atom unit cells .",
    "the crystalline coordinates were obtained from the inorganic crystal structure database and correspond to those reported in ref .  .",
    "in order to obtain a cubic supercell , we approximated the monoclinic unit cell of orpiment by an orthorhombic one simply by neglecting the small deviation of the angle @xmath59 from the right angle .",
    "then we used the experimental glass density of @xmath60 g/@xmath61 from ref .   in order to obtain the side length of the cubic supercell @xmath6217.25   and the coordinates of atoms from the cuboid with dimensions 11.48 by 19.15 by 21.28",
    "   were scaled by 1.5 , 0.9 , and 0.81 in the @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 directions , respectively .",
    "the use of the crystalline initial configuration gives the correct stoichiometry and the rescaling of a non - cubic supercell in order to obtain a cubic one serves the goal of eliminating possible anisotropies in physical properties .",
    "note that in ref .",
    ", the authors cut a cubic supercell from a crystalline phase of as@xmath0se@xmath1 isostructural to orpiment , thus achieving the above two goals , but disrupting the periodicity with respect to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "after thorough equilibration in the simulated liquid state , however , the use of either of these two prescriptions should lead to models with similar statistical properties .",
    "the initial configuration was melted and equilibrated first at @xmath66  k for 3 ps , and then the resulting configuration was allowed to equilibrate at @xmath67  k for 12 ps .",
    "the equilibration criterion used was the convergence of the average potential energy to a constant value .",
    "at such high temperatures , the accuracy of the calculations appears to be least significant for the subsequent generation of low - temperature structural models .",
    "therefore , at this stage , a minimal basis set of only s and p orbitals on both the as and s atoms was used , and the tight - binding scheme of sec .  [ sec : dftb ] was used without the self - consistent charge ( scc ) correction in order to speed up the calculations .",
    "it was necessary , however , to use the scc correction during the initial 1.5 ps of the @xmath66  k run , since the large forces resulting from the presence of small interatomic distances in the distorted starting configuration otherwise led to numerical instability .    while preparing computer - generated models of glasses , it is customary to mimic real experiments by reducing the temperature over time intervals whose length , however , is limited by the available computer time",
    "we found that , due to the unrealistically small length of such time intervals , this approach is rather impractical .",
    "instead , we used the available computer time to perform an annealing run at one fixed temperature which is low enough for the process of the bond - network formation to be activated and high enough for the topologically connected network to grow sufficiently rapidly .",
    "first , we performed a run corresponding to 6 ps at @xmath68  k with the scc correction and the minimal ( sp ) basis . keeping in mind that the simulation was done at constant volume , this temperature was chosen to be somewhat above the melting temperature of orpiment at atmospheric pressure ( @xmath69  k according to ref .  ) .",
    "we empirically found that annealing the configuration for the following 6 ps at a higher temperature of @xmath70  k slightly improved the quality of the network by increasing the fraction of heteropolar bonds in the model . during these two runs",
    ", we used a smaller time step of 50 a.u .",
    "( 1.2 fs ) . finally , the temperature was nearly instantaneously reduced to @xmath71  k , quenching the system within a metastable basin on the potential - energy hypersurface .",
    "the resulting model ( model 1 in the following ) remained stable while , during a run corresponding to 120 ps , 500 configurations separated by 10 time steps of 100 a.u . ( 24 fs ) were stored for subsequent analysis . in the last run",
    ", we used the scc correction and increased the basis set by including the d orbitals for sulphur atoms .",
    "this basis set extension provided a major impovement in the description of hypervalent sulphur molecules @xcite as well as silicon - oxygen compounds @xcite .",
    "while d orbitals on sulphur atoms give noticeable improvement , it appears that they are less important for arsenic and we restrict ourselves to including only s and p orbitals for the as atoms in order to speed up the calculations .",
    "model 1 contains three topologically identical coordination defects , namely intimate valence alternation pairs ( ivaps ) , where a singly coordinated sulphur atom is attached to a three - fold coordinated arsenic atom , thus increasing the coordination number of this arsenic atom to four .",
    "apart from the ivaps , the amorphous network is topologically ideal , in the sense that each sulphur atom is bonded to two neighbors and each arsenic atom is bonded to three",
    ". there is , however , a certain degree of chemical disorder in this system which manifests itself in the presence of nine as - as and six s - s homopolar bonds .    in the context of photoinduced metastability , a great deal of significance is attributed to the presence of topological and/or chemical defects @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative to create models both with and without such defects in a theoretical investigation that attempts to be conclusive .",
    "we produced additional models by `` surgically '' removing the ivap defects and homopolar bonds from model 1 .",
    "model 2 , which does not contain any topological defects , was obtained by removing the three singly coordinated sulphur atoms from model 1 and rescaling this 197-atom model to the original density .",
    "this procedure did not affect the stability of the amorphous network .    in order to eliminate the chemical defects , we iteratively applied the following algorithm that utilizes the ideas @xcite used to create models of binary amorphous solids ( e.g. a - sio@xmath0 ) from one - component continuous random networks ( e.g. a - si ) @xcite .",
    "first , a sulphur atom was inserted in the middle of each as - as homopolar bond .",
    "second , each s - s bond was replaced by a single sulphur atom located at its mid - point so that each local as - s - s - as configuration turned into as - s - as . third , the distance between each newly introduced s atom and its two nearest arsenic atoms in the newly created as - s - as units was reduced in order to increase the bonding character of the as - s bonds stretched by the above manipulation .",
    "we set a constraint on the length of the modified as - s bonds so that it did not exceed 2.5   .",
    "fourth , the modified configuration was relaxed in an md run at @xmath71  k for 2.5  ps , until the potential energy reached a plateau .",
    "after the first iteration , the 200-atom sample ( that we call model 3 in the following ) contained only one as - as and one s - s bond that were spatially well separated ( the minimum as - s distance among these four atoms was 4.6   ) .",
    "only two iterations were sufficient in order to obtain a model with all - heteropolar bonds , which we refer to as model 4 in the following . the defect statistics for models 1 - 4 are summarized in table  [ tab : models ] .      a common way to assess",
    "the quality of a structural model is to compare experimental and calculated static structure factors .",
    "we have calculated the structure factor @xmath72 by fourier transforming the radial pair - correlation function @xmath73 ( also often called the pair- or radial distribution function ) defined as ( see , e.g. , refs .  ):",
    "@xmath74 where the sum is over all pairs of atoms in the sample of volume @xmath53 separated by distance @xmath75 , @xmath52 is the total number of atoms and the angular brackets denote an ensemble average . in the case of neutron scattering , that is of interest here , @xmath76 is the coherent scattering length of atom @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the average scattering length .",
    "this function gives the probability of finding a pair of atoms a distance @xmath79 apart , relative to the probability expected for a completely random distribution of atoms at the same density .",
    "for a binary alloy , e.g. as@xmath0s@xmath1 , it is of interest to decompose @xmath73 in terms of the partial pair - correlation functions @xmath80 : @xmath81 where the double sum is over atomic types and @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the atomic fraction of @xmath23 atoms .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gofr ] ) , it follows that @xmath84 where the index @xmath85 runs over @xmath23-type atoms only .",
    "the values of the scattering lengths used here were @xmath86  fm and @xmath87  fm ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in practice",

    "( [ eq : gabofr ] ) is replaced by a function which is non - zero in a small range of separations , and a histogram is compiled of all pair separations falling within each such range ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "analogously , the bond - angle distribution function can be calculated as a histogram of all bond angles in the system .",
    "while bond - angle distributions provide information on the short - range order of an amorphous material , ring statistics have been generally used as a measure of the medium - range order .",
    "an @xmath89-membered ring is a closed loop with @xmath89 atoms ( or bonds ) . here",
    ", we count only the shortest - path ( irreducible ) rings @xcite , i.e. those which do not have `` shortcuts '' across them . in order to identify such rings we use the algorithm due to franzblau @xcite , as implemented in the program `` statix '' by jungnickel @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to travel along the network paths ( bond chains ) containing a tagged atom and identify all the rings of length up to a given maximum . for each ring , it can then be verified whether it is an irreducible one ( containing no cross links ) .    experiments also provide information on the vibrational and electronic densities of states ( vdos and edos ) which can be compared with the results obtained from simulation .",
    "in addition to this , simulations allow one to assess the degree of localization of the vibrational and electronic eigenstates .",
    "we compute both the vibrational and electronic densities of states by using the following definition : @xmath90 where the constant @xmath91 is determined by normalization , @xmath92 are eigenfrequencies of the hessian ( dynamical ) matrix of an energy - minimum configuration in the case of the vdos or kohn - sham eigenfrequencies ( or energies ) corresponding to this configuration in the case of the edos , and the sum is over all eigenstates . in practice , in order to obtain a smooth representaion of @xmath93 , the delta function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dos ] ) is replaced by a gaussian function centered at @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast to the eigenstates of a perfect crystal , that extend over the entire sample , some eigenstates in disordered solids are localized at relatively small groups of atoms .",

    "the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) concept employed in the dftb program allows one to separate the contributions from individual atomic sites and orbitals to the total charge for a particular eigenstate , and to decompose the total edos in terms of the local electronic densities of states ( ledos ) . using the mulliken population analysis ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",

    "it may appear reasonable to ascribe the asymmetry of the distributions for s - as - s and as - s - as angles in the form of the shoulders on the low - angle side to the presence of four - membered as - s - as - s rings , as has been observed in tetrahedrally bonded chalcogenide semiconductors , e.g. ges@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although such four - membered rings would definitely contribute to the low - angle part of the distribution due to geometrical constraints , their number in our models is not so large ( see table  [ tab : rings ] ) and , for that reason , the relative fraction of angles involved in these rings is rather small ( about 7  % of s - as - s angles and 13  % of as - s - as angles ) .",

    "although the coordination - number defects are optically active , their presence may not be necessary for exhibiting photostructural changes when there is a sufficient concentration of homopolar bonds in the material .",
    "this statement is supported by the observation that , upon removal of the coordination defects from the system , the degree of electronic - state localization is not reduced in the resultant continuous network model with homopolar bonds .",
    "furthermore , the valence - alternation defect concentration is estimated to be rather small ( 10@xmath134 @xmath135 in ref .  )",
    "compared to the atomic density of about @xmath136  @xmath135 .",
    "this indicates that , in the volume occupied by our 200-atom models , it is less likely to find a topological defect than to come across none .    a stoichiometric continuous network model has allowed us to identify the structural motifs where electronic eigenstates predominantly localize at the optical band edges , in the absence of coordination and chemical defects .",
    "these are sulphur - rich regions for the top of the valence band and four - membered rings for the bottom of the conduction band . electronic properties of this glass model with all - heteropolar bonds are very similar to those of the corresponding crystalline phase , orpiment , most notably the clean gaps in both s and p bands .",
    "although the valence band in this case contains about as many localized states as in models with defects , the conduction band has very few of them .",
    "it is expected that , if there were no four - membered rings in this structure , all states in the conduction band would be virtually delocalized .",
    "therefore we conclude that perhaps the dominant contribution to photo - induced effects originates from the presence of electronic states localized in the vicinity of homopolar bonds , in support of the theoretical models where the photo - induced structural changes are attributed to the presence of homopolar bonds in these materials ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "although electronic states can also localize in all - heteropolar regions and in the vicinity of the topological defects , the contribution of such states is likely to be rather small due to the low degree of localization in the conduction band and the low concentration of such defects , respectively .",
