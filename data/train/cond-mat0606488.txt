    "in ( ga , mn)as , currently the most studied dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) , a long - range ferromagnetic interaction between dilute mn@xmath1 spins is mediated by valence band ( or defect band ) hole spins.@xcite most experimental work in this system has focused on achieving maximal curie temperatures ( @xmath2 s ) in a technological drive to bring ferromagnetism in ( ga , mn)as to more practical temperatures.@xcite in this vein , it was determined that a crucial limiting parameter of the @xmath2 of as - grown ( ga , mn)as is the incorporation of hole compensating crystalline defects , which are unintentionally formed due to the low growth temperature ( @xmath3250c ) and low solubility of mn in gaas .",
    "one such defect , the mn interstitial ( mn@xmath4 ) , is considered to be a double donor compensating two holes each.@xcite these defects have shown a surprisingly high diffusivity allowing for their removal by using post - growth annealing at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath3200c ) that drive them to the surface.@xcite consequently , the three dimensional hole density ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath2 after annealing can be drastically increased.@xcite another well - studied defect in low temperature ( lt ) grown gaas is excess arsenic . for substrate temperatures less than 300c , excess arsenic",
    "is incorporated by occupying a ga - site , called an antisite defect ( as@xmath6 ) which - like the mn@xmath7 defect is also a double donor.@xcite the density of these defects can reach 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath31% of ga - sites , which is the same order of magnitude as typical mn doping levels.@xcite by post - growth annealing at temperatures above 500c , as@xmath6 can be removed by the formation of metallic as precipitates,@xcite however at these temperatures mn also precipitates out of the ( ga , mn)as solid solution as mnas nano - particles.@xcite    most experimental work on ( ga , mn)as has been aimed at maximizing the @xmath2 by controlling the compensating defects in the high doping regime , i.e. mn @xmath35 - 9% .",
    "such studies mainly focus on the reduction of mn@xmath4 defects through post - growth annealing while loosely treating the problem of as non - stoichiometry .",
    "as@xmath6 defects are usually ignored in the high doping regime since mn@xmath4 defects are the main source of carrier compensation , and their removal has led to dramatic increases in @xmath5 and @xmath2.@xcite on the other hand , hole compensation due to as@xmath6 could be as large as 10@xmath8 @xmath9 , which would shift @xmath2 in this mn - doping range by up to 10 k.    in contrast , near the ferromagnetic threshold of @xmath3 1% mn , compensation due to as@xmath6 could dramatically alter the @xmath2 s since here the defect and dopant densities are roughly equal .",
    "additionally , the concentration of mn necessary for the onset of ferromagnetism should be a strong function of carrier compensation since the ferromagnetism depends strongly on @xmath5 ; _ in the low doping limit ferromagnetism is likely extrinsically limited by hole compensating defects_. we also note that theoretical work predicts a change in the mechanism of ferromagnetism in the low doping limit , near the insulator - metal transition,@xcite compared with the metallic limit at which @xmath0 as predicted by the zener - model.@xcite    the effect of excess as on the lattice constant of ( ga , mn)as was treated by schott _",

    "they followed - up their study by using 2 different as : ga beam flux ratios , differing by 500% and noted large changes in the lattice constant of ( ga , mn)as over a broad range of mn - doping and substrate temperatures.@xcite these results were elaborated upon by sadowski and domagala , who measured lattice constant variation in ga@xmath10mn@xmath11as grown using 3 different as : ga flux ratios and noted an interplay between mn@xmath4 and as@xmath6 incorporation for this mn doping regime.@xcite campion _ et al .",
    "_ reported an improvement in structural and magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as films grown using as@xmath12 instead of as@xmath13.@xcite their paper , however , does not describe the fluxes used for each as - species nor how the effective iii - v ratio varies between these cases . the same group has reported impressively high @xmath2 s over a broad range of mn - doping levels , mentioning the importance of minimizing the as : ga flux ratio although no data on the variation of this parameter were provided.@xcite avrutin _",
    "_ carried out the first study that measured both the structural , electrical , and magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as using 2 different as : ga flux ratios.@xcite they noted an optimization of the hole density , conductivity , and @xmath2 for the low as : ga flux ratio , where fewer as@xmath6 should be incorporated .    in this paper , we present the first systematic investigation of the effect of as@xmath6 incorporation on the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as in the low mn - doping regime .",
    "the as : ga flux ratio is smoothly varied within individual samples by using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) without substrate rotation .",
    "the geometry of the mbe chamber inherently provides a gradient in the as : ga flux ratio across the substrate of @xmath1450% , while maintaining a roughly uniform mn flux . in order to avoid formation of mn@xmath4 and to achieve a high sensitivity to carrier compensation , we chose mn doping concentrations of 1 - 2% , in the region of the onset of ferromagnetism . at mn concentrations",
    "less than 1.5% , mn@xmath4 has a larger formation energy than mn@xmath6.@xcite thus no interstitial mn will form and all hole compensation should originate from as@xmath6 .",

    "the substrate temperature is monitored by absorption band edge spectroscopy ( abes ) , which measures the substrate temperature in real - time through white - light transmission spectroscopy . the temperature stability during lt ( ga , mn)as and gaas growths is typically @xmath21c .",
    "the growth rate of gaas at the center of the wafer is 0.7 ml / sec as calibrated by rheed intensity oscillations of the specular spot at 580c .",
    "the mn doping density is inferred from rheed intensity oscillation measurements@xcite of the mnas growth rate performed at 240c .",
    "measurements of the mn density by secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) indicate that the rheed calibration underestimates the density by up to 0.4% mn , which provides a rough error estimate for the quoted mn concentrations .",
    "we use as@xmath12 for all samples presented here , employing a valved cracker / sublimator . the beam equivalent pressure ( bep ) of as@xmath12 and ga",
    "are measured with a nude ion gauge at the center position of the substrate just prior to growth .",
    "the ratio of as@xmath12 and ga beps , defined as @xmath22 , is proportional to the ratio of the atomic fluxes of as and ga delivered to the growing surface . unfortunately , a reliable quantitative conversion from bep to atomic flux is difficult due to the uncertainties in the ionization efficiencies of each beam species.@xcite a rough estimate gives that the atomic flux ratio is 2.5 times smaller than the bep ratios , where we assume that only as@xmath12 are present with a temperature equal to that of the cracking zone .",
    "the following procedure is used for both non - rotated and rotated growths prior to deposition of the low temperature ( lt ) films .",
    "the wafer is first heated to 635c with @xmath23 for oxide desorption , monitored by rheed , and subsequently cooled to 585c .",
    "while rotating at 10 rpm , a 300-nm gaas buffer layer is grown using 5-s growth interrupts for every 15 nm of deposition resulting in a streaky 2 @xmath24 4 surface reconstruction rheed pattern . while cooling the substrate to 250c , the as - valve setting is reduced at 400c for the desired @xmath22 value for lt growth .",
    "prior to lt growth , a streaky 4 @xmath24 4 surface reconstruction is observed in the rheed pattern . for rotated growths ,",
    "once the substrate stabilizes at 250c the lt growth begins . for non - rotated growths ,",
    "the substrate rotation is stopped at 400c and the wafer [ 110 ] crystal axis ( perpendicular to the wafer major flat ) is aligned along the @xmath22 gradient direction ( y - axis ) .",
    "this can be reproducibly accomplished noting the radial angle between the rheed e - beam and substrate , fixed by the mbe chamber geometry , and finding a high symmetry crystal axis from the surface reconstruction pattern .",

    "correspondingly , @xmath2 decreases with @xmath5 , and for @xmath26 ferromagnetism is suppressed .",

    "decreasing @xmath22 below the stoichiometric value leads to a ga - rich surface that serves as a kinetic barrier for the incorporation of group - iii substitutional dopants , such as mn .",
    "one might consider the alternative possibility that interstitial incorporation of mn might occur in these circumstances and could explain the reduction in hole density in the ga - rich region .",
    "however , if mn@xmath4 donors were incorporating and compensating the mn@xmath6 acceptors , then the carrier density should change as the mn - doping density is altered , which is not the case here .",
    "preliminary sims data show a decreasing concentration of mn in the ga - rich region as the thickness increases , whereas the as - rich region reveals a relatively constant mn depth profiles throughout the mn - doped layer . in the ga - rich region",
    "the mn density can be @xmath57 @xmath58 lower than in the as - rich region .",
    "the position of the hole density peak can be controlled by adjusting @xmath22 at y = 0 , which shifts the position of the stoichiometric condition along y. to demonstrate this , two wafers with identical mn concentration of 1.5 % are grown but with different @xmath22 at y = 0 .",
    "the variation of @xmath5 along y is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5]c . by increasing @xmath22 at y = 0 from 8:1 to 9:1 , the peak position ( stoichiometric condition )",
    "is shifted by @xmath3 1 cm toward the center of the wafer in a direction away from the as source .",
    "this shift is observable by eye as a change in the position of the transition region , where the surface changes from mirror finish to hazy .",
    "converting the y - position to @xmath22 should fully overlap the hole density peaks , fig .",
    "the peaks do not completely overlap indicating that additional factors must be considered , such as the variation in the growth rate across non - rotated wafers , which may play a role in the density of compensating as@xmath6 defects . in the present analysis",

    "@xmath2 is determined from scans similar to those plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath2 tracks the @xmath5 variation with @xmath22 , displaying a maximum in curie temperature in the same region where the hole density peaks . in the as - rich portion of the wafer ,",
    "as@xmath6 donors limit the hole density and therefore @xmath2 .",
    "this effect is very clear , for example , with @xmath60 , where ferromagnetism is completely suppressed in both 1.5% and 1.25% samples due to hole compensation from as non - stoichiometry in the form of as@xmath6 donors .    the width and shape of the @xmath2 and hole density peaks are quite different . in general ,",
    "the @xmath2 peaks are wider than the hole density peaks on the as - rich side , but are sharper than the hole density peak on the ga - rich side of the wafer .",
    "to explain this behavior , we replot data from several of the non - rotated ( ga , mn)as wafers to examine the dependence of @xmath2 on the hole density .",
    "this dependence is plotted for the as - rich region ( @xmath61 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , and for the ga - rich region ( @xmath62 ) in fig .",

    "however , ferromagnetism is not observed over the same large range in hole densities where ferromagnetism is observed in the as - rich material , shaded grey . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : structural ] and [ subsec : pgradient ] , hole density and film morphology measurements indicate that in the ga - rich region mn solubility is limited to well - below the level required for ferromagnetism , @xmath27 0.5 % .",
    "this is probably due to the kinetic disadvantage of a group - iii dopant on a heavily ga - rich surface because of out - competition .",
    "the discrepancy in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] between the ga - rich region and as - rich region offers further support for this hypothesis . in this interpretation ,",
    "ga - rich conditions limit mn@xmath6 to low doping densities of less than 10@xmath47 @xmath9 ( @xmath27 0.05% mn ) . whereas for similar hole densities in the as - rich material mn@xmath65 @xmath9 ( @xmath31% mn ) .",
    "thus ferromagnetism is possible in the as - rich material since there are sufficient mn@xmath6 acceptors , but the @xmath2 is limited by hole compensation due to as@xmath6 donors . in the ga - rich material , as@xmath6 compensating donors are not present , but the mn@xmath6 density is well below the ferromagnetic limit .    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a for which @xmath66 0 are fit to @xmath64 ( line ) .",
    "this fit describes the data from two non - rotated wafers with mn = 1.5% ( fig . [",
    "fig5]c ) and one wafer with 1.25% mn over a large range in @xmath5 and @xmath2 , over 13 data points . in the rotated growths presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath63 behavior is observed for samples with @xmath67 1.5% mn .",
    "there is no discrepancy between the non - rotated and rotated ( ga , mn)as films if we conjecture that a change in the exponent from 0.33 to 0.09 occurs as the doping is reduced below 1.5% mn . since these doping levels are close to the ferromagnetic limit , a change in the dependence of ferromagnetism is not unexpected .",
    "the impurity band is fully merged with the valence band in the metallic region of high mn - doping , where the @xmath63 is observed .",
    "but at low mn - doping levels close to the insulating regime , the impurity band is separated from the valence band ( mott gap ) where a disorder - based model of ferromagnetism is probably more accurate.@xcite erwin and petukhov predicted that a strong deviation from the metallic behavior of @xmath0 should occur in the low mn - doping regime , @xmath31.5% mn , with @xmath2 reaching a maximum in a partially compensated condition ( lower @xmath5 ) and ferromagnetism disappearing for zero compensation ( highest @xmath5 ) ; their model assumed that compensation was due to mn@xmath4 alone.@xcite this behavior is not clearly seen in our data , however the observed as@xmath6 compensation was not treated in the model of erwin and petukhov .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as reveal a strong sensitivity to as@xmath6 donors that compensate mn@xmath6 acceptors . by varying @xmath22 , the hole densities of ( ga",
    ", mn)as films are varied by more than two orders of magnitude , and , as a result , ferromagnetism can be enhanced or completely suppressed . for as - rich growth , films show the maximum smoothness , but lowest @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath22 is reduced , the film roughness increases up to the stoichiometric condition , where @xmath5 and @xmath2 are maximized . for ga - rich growth ,",
    "the film roughness increases by an order of magnitude as excess ga accumulates on the surface .",
    "the group - iii rich surface suppresses substitutional mn incorporation leading to lower @xmath5 and t@xmath68 values than in the as - rich condition . in the low mn - doped regime ,",
    "where as - compensation limits hole density and ferromagnetic ordering , a strong deviation from the usual @xmath0 behavior is observed with @xmath64 for x @xmath27 1.5% .",
    "this dependence applies equally well to stoichiometric ( ga , mn)as as it does to heavily as@xmath6 compensated ( ga , mn)as .",
    "this change in the hole density dependence of @xmath2 occurs in the doping region where the effects of a mott gap and disorder are expected to alter the mechanism of ferromagnetism.@xcite our results emphasize that precise control of hole compensation due to as@xmath20 is critical to maximizing the value of @xmath2 s in the low mn - doping regime .",
    "the combinatorial mbe growth approach used here could be applied to more complex lt grown gaas - based heterostructures in which @xmath22 is a strong control parameter .",
    "the rapid and high - resolution mapping of growth parameter phase - space by this technique allows for systematic investigations not practicable using more traditional methods .",
