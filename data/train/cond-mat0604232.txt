    "the recent advances in the manipulation of ultracold gases have made it possible to employ these systems to accurately simulate several non - trivial problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "as examples , we may mention the exploration of the bcs to bec crossover @xcite and the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "disorder plays an important role in the theory of solid state , affecting in a substantial way the transport properties of various systems .",
    "special attention has in the past been dedicated to studies of light propagation in strongly - scattering powders and electron transport in the presence of impurities @xcite .",
    "it looks therefore interesting to introduce a controlled disorder in the experiments with ultracold atoms , in order to provide a closer modeling of realistic systems of condensed matter physics .",
    "it was indeed predicted that atomic gases stored in optical lattices would be good candidates to experimentally observe the effect of a disordered or quasi - periodic potential on an interacting bose gas or on interacting fermi - bose mixture @xcite .",
    "first experimental results along this research line have been recently reported , i.e.  the observation of a bose glass in a quasi - periodic potential @xcite and the study of spatial coherence properties of an interacting bose gas trapped in a lattice in presence of a disordered ensemble of fermionic atoms @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a variant of this line of research , that is the possibility of looking for genuine localized states of a non - interacting matter wave exposed to static disorder in continuous space .",
    "localized states are stationary states with a square integrable wave function at an energy where the classical motion is not bounded spatially . in a paper that dates back to the early years of quantum mechanics ,",
    "von neumann and wigner @xcite showed that the schrdinger equation can admit square integrable eigenstates embedded in the continuum of states with energy higher than the maximum of the potential .",
    "after the work of anderson @xcite , it is expected that disordered potentials can generically lead in 3d to a quantum phase transition , a macroscopic number of localized states being present at low energy .",
    "such a phase transition in 3d is not straightforward to observe , as it is sensitive to decoherence and wave absorption effects , and requires a mean free path of the wave @xmath0 smaller than its wave length @xmath1 , as stated by the ioffe - regel criterion @xmath2    the study of localization of light is a well developed experimental subject : strong localization of light has been reported in semi - conductor powders @xcite , and weak localization effects of light in a gas of cold atoms are the subject of an intensive experimental study @xcite . on the contrary , for matter waves , no direct evidence of localization was obtained in 3d .",
    "matter waves made of ultracold atoms are good candidates in this respect , due to their weak coupling to the environment and to the possibility of tuning their interactions with a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "an open problem is however to know if strong enough disorder can be introduced in these gases to lead to reasonably short localization lengths in 3d .",
    "a natural way to produce a disordered potential in atomic gases is to use the speckle pattern of a laser beam @xcite .",
    "many experiments on bose - einstein condensates in 1d random optical potentials have very recently been reported @xcite , and they provide evidence for disorder - related effects such as fragmentation of the condensate , suppression of diffusion , frequency shifts and damping of collective oscillations .",
    "theoretically , these effects were discussed in @xcite . genuine strong localization in 1d , in the non - interacting regime ,",
    "has not been reported yet in these experiments , and the implementation of the disordered optical potential in 3d remains to be done .",
    "also the theoretical analysis of matter wave localization in a speckle pattern , recently performed in 2d @xcite , has not been done in a detailed way in the 3d strong localization regime .",

    "the lattice does not act on the matter wave a. ]    an alternative method to realize a disordered potential was proposed in @xcite : a matter wave , made of atoms of a species @xmath4 , scatters off a set of atoms of another species @xmath5 that are trapped in randomly chosen sites of a deep optical lattice with no multiply occupied sites ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : sketch ] ) . as we will choose the lattice to be very far detuned for the species @xmath4 , the matter wave moves unaffected through the optical lattice , and interacts only with the @xmath5 atoms : this excludes classical localization effects in local potential minima .",
    "the disorder can be made very strong , since ( i ) the correlation length of the disorder can be as small as @xmath6 m ( the spatial period of the optical lattice ) , and ( ii ) the scattering cross section of the matter wave off a single @xmath5 atom can be made as high as allowed by quantum mechanics ( the so - called unitary limit ) by use of a @xmath7 interspecies feshbach resonance , making it possible to dramatically reduce the mean free path of the matter wave .",
    "furthermore , as we shall take advantage of , this model allows a straightforward exact numerical analysis even in 3d , when @xmath5 atoms are modeled as fixed point - like scatterers , as is known for light waves @xcite .",
    "it is the 3d version of this scheme that we analyze in this paper .",
    "after the detailed presentation of our model and its practical implementation given in sec .",
    "[ sec : our - proposal ] , we show numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : localized - states ] that it leads to the appearance of a large number of localized states for a range of parameters accessible in present experiments , provided that the effective coupling between the matter wave and a single scatterer is tuned to a value of the order of the mean scatterer separation .",
    "section [ sec : effective ] is dedicated to the quantitative description of the scattering between the matter wave and a single trapped scatterer , and to the discussion of the confinement - induced resonances thereby arising : we show indeed that large enough effective coupling constants can be obtained .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , including a discussion of a possible strategy of observation of strong localization .",
    "the scatterers are a set of identical particles , whose chemical species and quantum numbers will be indexed by the letter @xmath5 , randomly occupying ( with filling factor @xmath8 ) the sites of a 3d cubic optical lattice . the potential seen by the @xmath5 atoms",
    "is produced by a superposition of three laser standing waves of common intensity and mutually orthogonal linear polarizations along the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes,@xmath12,\\label{eq : opticallattice}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the modulation depth of the lattice and @xmath14 is the laser wavenumber .",
    "we shall denote the lattice spatial period along each axis by @xmath15 .",
    "multiple occupation of a lattice well is assumed to be absent , by use of polarized fermions , or by creation of vacancies in a unit occupancy mott phase state @xcite , or simply by choosing @xmath3 sufficiently small to make it statistically irrelevant .",
    "we choose the lattice depth @xmath16 to be much larger than the recoil energy @xmath17 of the @xmath5 atoms so that the tunneling time of @xmath5 atoms from one lattice site to another ( @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) is negligible over the duration of the experiment and the disordered spatial pattern of @xmath5 atoms is static @xcite .",
    "we also require that each @xmath5 atom is prepared in the vibrational ground state of the local lattice micro - trap , which can be achieved in practice by raising adiabatically the optical lattice on top of a condensate cloud of atoms @xmath5 @xcite , or by applying raman laser cooling sideband techniques @xcite to an optical molasses .",
    "this condition is crucial to ensure that each @xmath7 scattering event is elastic when the @xmath4 atoms have sufficiently low energy : indeed , energy conservation guarantees that the @xmath5 atom is left in the vibrational ground state after scattering with a @xmath4 atom of momentum @xmath20 if@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the oscillation frequency of a @xmath5 atom in a micro - trap .",
    "a last point is to ensure that spontaneous emission processes are negligible for the @xmath5 atoms . in order to achieve large values of @xmath16 with negligible heating of the trapped scatterers ,",
    "we require the lattice to be blue - detuned with respect to the strongest transition of the @xmath5 atoms ( in blue - detuned lattices , particles are trapped in the minima of intensity of the stationary light field ) . including the lamb - dicke type reduction factor coming from the trapping of @xmath5 atoms close to the nodes of the laser field , one gets the fluorescence rate @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the atom - laser detuning and @xmath25 is the spontaneous emission rate of @xmath5 atoms .    for the bosonic @xmath26rb isotope of rubidium ( @xmath27 nm , @xmath28 nm ) and an optical lattice tuned at @xmath29 nm , only at @xmath30 nm to the blue of the strongest rubidium transition at 780 nm , at the required lattice intensity @xmath19 the tunneling time is @xmath31s @xcite and the fluorescence rate is @xmath32 , allowing experimental times up to @xmath33ms . the same calculation , taking for @xmath5 the fermionic isotope @xmath34k of potassium ( @xmath35 nm , @xmath36 nm ) and an optical wavelength @xmath37 nm leads to @xmath38s and @xmath39 .      the matter wave to be strongly - localized is made of atoms of another species , that we will label by @xmath4 .",
    "we shall ignore interaction effects among these @xmath4 atoms .",
    "one way to fulfill this condition in a real experiment would be to take spin polarized fermionic atoms : @xmath40-wave interactions are prohibited by the exclusion principle and @xmath3-wave interactions are very weak at low energies in the absence of a @xmath3-wave resonance .",
    "the @xmath4 atoms experience interactions with the trapped species @xmath5 . at low incoming kinetic energy of a @xmath4 particle",
    ", we model these interactions by static contact potentials , corresponding to infinitely - massive point - like scatterers , each located at the center of a micro - well occupied by a @xmath5 atom : @xmath41 where the sum is taken over the @xmath42 scatterers .",
    "the effective scattering length @xmath43 of a @xmath4 atom on a trapped @xmath5 atom , when expressed in units of the harmonic - oscillator length @xmath44 , is a function of the dimensionless ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the @xmath7 scattering length in free space . the value of @xmath48 and the validity condition of our model potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff ] ) , will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : effective ] .",
    "the @xmath4 atoms also experience the optical lattice potential , with the same spatial dependence as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opticallattice ] ) but with a different modulation amplitude @xmath49 .",
    "we require the optical lattice to be much closer to resonance with @xmath5 atoms than with @xmath4 atoms , @xmath50 , such that @xmath49 will be much smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , we impose that @xmath51 so that , in the absence of @xmath5 atoms , the @xmath4 atoms can be safely considered as free . in this respect , a particularly promising combination is given by fermionic @xmath52li for the species @xmath4 ( @xmath53 nm ) and @xmath26rb for the species @xmath5 : taking @xmath29 nm and a laser intensity such that @xmath19 , one finds @xmath54 . if one takes for @xmath5 the fermionic @xmath34k with @xmath55 nm , one finds @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore neglect the effect of the optical lattice on the @xmath4 atoms and take as a model hamiltonian for the matter wave : @xmath57 we note in passing that in the original anderson model the @xmath4 particles were instead assumed to be in the tight - binding regime , so that the strong localization reported in this paper is not _",
    "stricto sensu _",
    "anderson localization .    to end this section , we briefly discuss two effects not included in our model hamiltonian that may impose limitations in a real experiment .",
    "as we shall see , the production of localized states with a short localization length ( of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath58 ) requires the use of a large and positive value of @xmath59 , obtained by a @xmath7 feshbach resonance . as a consequence ,",
    "the matter wave @xmath4 has a weakly bound state with a trapped atom @xmath5 , of spatial extension @xmath60 .",
    "a first undesired effect is therefore the formation of such @xmath7 dimers .",
    "a first stage that may lead to a dimer production is during the feshbach ramp of @xmath43 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "this may be avoided by using a ramping time longer than the inverse of the dimer binding frequency , @xmath63s for our previous example with lithium and rubidium . once @xmath43",
    "is set to @xmath62 , one may fear that three - body collisions @xmath64 lead to the formation of a dimer . for our model hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) the @xmath4 particles are an ideal gas and the dimer formation does not happen : the trapped @xmath5 particle , being replaced by a fixed scatterer with no degree of freedom , can not mediate a @xmath65 interaction . in the opposite limit where the @xmath5 scatterer is supposed to move freely , the rate of dimer formation per @xmath5 atom is @xmath66 , where we used eqs .",

    "the calculation of the actual dimer formation rate in our model , taking into consideration the trapping of the @xmath5 atoms , requires the solution of a three - body problem with no center - of - mass separability , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "a second undesired effect is the one of gravity .",
    "if the lattice is arranged to be stationary in a free - falling frame , this frame having initially an upward velocity component @xmath78 in the lab frame and finally a downward velocity component @xmath78 , the overall vertical motion of the lattice in such a fountain - like experiment is less than 3 cm for a total time of 150 ms .",
    "longer times may be obtained if one compensates gravity , e.g. by a using the inflexion point of the optical potential produced by a far - detuned gaussian laser beam , or by using electro - optical potentials @xcite .",

    "the ioffe - regel criterion eq .",
    "( [ eq : ircrit ] ) is considered as a necessary condition to achieve strong localization @xcite .",
