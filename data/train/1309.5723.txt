    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite is one of the cornerstone of the electroweak sector of standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an intensive study on the ckm matrix elements is helpful for testing sm and for exploring new physics beyond sm . among those matrix elements ,",
    "the precise determination of @xmath6 provides a stringent test of the ckm mechanism of the flavor structure and the charge - parity violation .",
    "the ckm matrix element @xmath6 can be determined from inclusive and exclusive semi - leptonic @xmath4 meson decays . experimental studies on @xmath6 has been done in the literature , cf.refs.@xcite .",

    "it has also been perturbatively studied by using the operator production expansion approach  @xcite .",
    "the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) has performed a global analysis of the inclusive observables in @xmath15 decays  @xcite , which results in @xmath16 and @xmath17 by using the kinetic scheme and the @xmath18 scheme , respectively .    among the @xmath4-meson decay channels ,",
    "the semi - leptonic decays such as @xmath19 have aroused people s great interests , which have been frequently used to determine the value of @xmath6 and/or the @xmath2-meson distribution amplitude ( da ) . in dealing with those semi - leptonic channels ,",
    "it is necessary to have a reliable estimation on the @xmath0 transition form factors ( tffs ) within its allowable kinematic region @xmath20 .",
    "because the charm quark mass is much smaller than the bottom quark mass , the @xmath21 tffs can be calculated by using the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) for proper kinematical range in which the operator product expansion can be done near the light cone .",
    "more over , similar to @xmath22 tffs , e.g. ref.@xcite , it is reasonable to assume that the @xmath0 tffs can also be consistently analyzed via the pqcd , the lattice qcd and the lcsr approaches , which are applicable within different @xmath23 regions .",
    "the pqcd is applicable for smaller @xmath24 and the lattice qcd is applicable for larger @xmath25 . while , the lcsr , in which the non - perturbative dynamics are effectively parameterized in the so - called light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas )  @xcite , is restricted to small and moderate @xmath23 regions .",
    "thus , a more accurate lcsr shall present a better connection between the pqcd and the lattice qcd estimations , and then to achieve a better understanding of those tffs .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall calculate the @xmath0 tffs by using the lcsr approach , and determine @xmath6 by comparing with the experimental values on the decay width of the @xmath0 semileptonic decays . for the purpose",

    "we shall adopt the lcsr with its improved version  @xcite to deal with the process . by using the improved lcsr ,",
    "a chiral current correlator is taken as the starting point such that the relevant ( most uncertain ) twist-3 lcdas make no contributions and the reliability of lcsr estimation can be enhanced to a large degree .",
    "further more , we shall show that the twist-4 das also have quite small contributions to the lcsr .",
    "this inversely makes the @xmath0 semi - leptonic decays be good places for testing different models of the @xmath2 meson leading - twist lcda .    for the purpose",
    ", we shall introduce a model for the @xmath2-meson leading - twist da based on the well - known brodsky - huang - lepage ( bhl ) prescription  @xcite , whose longitudinal behavior is dominantly determined by an input parameter @xmath4 .",
    "varying @xmath4 within certain region , one can conveniently mimic the @xmath2-meson da behavior suggested in the literature",
    ". a comparison of three typical @xmath2-meson da models shall also be presented . by comparing the estimations with the experimental data on the @xmath2-meson involved processes",
    ", one may get a possible range for the parameter @xmath4 and a determined behavior for the @xmath2-meson da .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the calculation technologies for dealing with the dominant components of @xmath0 semi - leptonic processes : i ) we present the detail for deriving the dominant tff @xmath31 within the lcsr up to twist-4 accuracy ; ii ) we present several models for @xmath2 meson leading twist wave function ( and hence its lcda ) ; iii ) the @xmath4 and @xmath2 decay constants are two important physical quantities for determining the @xmath0 tffs .",
    "we present the @xmath4 meson and @xmath2 meson decay constants up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) level .",
    "numerical results are given in sec.iii , where the properties of the @xmath2 meson lcda , the @xmath0 tffs and the @xmath6 are presented .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "the @xmath0 tffs relevant for the semi - leptonic decay @xmath32 can be parameterized as    @xmath33 f_+(q^2 ) + \\frac{m_b^2-m_d^2}{q^2 } q_{\\mu } f_0(q^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2f_+(q^2)p_{d\\mu } + [ f_+(q^2 ) + f_-(q^2)]q_{\\mu } , \\label{eq : matrix1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the momentum transfer @xmath34 and the relation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , has been adopted . after integrating over the phase space , the differential decay width of @xmath38 over @xmath23 can be written as    @xmath39 , \\label{vcb1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the fermi constant and @xmath41 is the phase - space factor . for the case of @xmath42 or @xmath43 , @xmath44 , the term involving @xmath35 shall play a negligible role .",
    "this is the so - called chiral suppression .",
    "more specifically , by taking the limit @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 the tff @xmath46 is an important component for the semi - leptonic decay and has been calculated by the lattice qcd approach  @xcite , the pqcd approach  @xcite and the qcd lcsr approach  @xcite .",
    "if we have known the tff @xmath46 well , one can extract @xmath6 by comparing with the data , i.e. via the following equation @xmath47 here @xmath48 stands for the @xmath4 meson lifetime and @xmath49 stands for the branching ratio of @xmath50 , both of which are experimentally measurable parameters .      for",
    "the @xmath4 meson decays to light meson , its basic quantity for a lcsr calculation is the correlation function of the weak current and a current evaluated between the vacuum and a light meson . to figure out the dominant twist-2 contribution and make it a better platform for determining the properties of the twist-2 lcda",

    "the advantage of such a choice lies in that the contributions from the twist-3 lcdas are eliminated exactly due to chiral correlation suppression .",
    "this treatment is at the price of introducing an extra contribution from a scalar @xmath4 meson with @xmath54 corresponding to operator @xmath55 . to suppress the error caused by such treatment",
    ", one can set the continuum threshold parameter @xmath56 to be the one close to the lowest scalar @xmath4 meson , which is smaller than the pseudoscalar @xmath4 meson mass .",
    "this is the reason why for the improved lcsr approach the value of @xmath56 is usually taken to be those lower than the conventional lcsr .",
    "an uncertainty analysis on the choice of @xmath56 shall be presented in our numerical estimations .    on the one hand , for large ( negative ) virtualities of those currents , the correlator in the coordinate - space is dominated by distances close to the light - cone ( @xmath57 ) and can be treated within the framework of light - cone expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "the same correlator can be written as a dispersion relation , in the virtuality of the current coupling to @xmath4 meson . equating the light - cone expansion with the dispersion relation , and separating the lowest lying @xmath4 meson contribution from those of higher states via quark - hadron duality , one obtains the required lcsr for the tffs describing @xmath58 light meson decays . in this way",
    ", the lcsr allows the calculation of the properties of nonexcited hadron - states with a reasonable theoretical uncertainty . following such standard procedures ,",

    "<S> the improved qcd light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) provides an effective way to deal with the heavy - to - light transition form factors ( tffs ) . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we adopt the improved lcsr approach to deal with the @xmath0 tff @xmath1 up to twist-4 accuracy . due to the elimination of the most uncertain twist-3 contribution and the large suppression of the twist-4 contribution </S>",
    "<S> , the obtained lcsr shall provide us a good platform for testing the @xmath2-meson leading - twist da . </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose , we suggest a new model for the @xmath2-meson leading - twist da ( @xmath3 ) , whose longitudinal behavior is dominantly determined by a parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find its second gegenbauer moment @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> varying @xmath4 within certain region , one can conveniently mimic the @xmath2-meson da behavior suggested in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> inversely , by comparing the estimations with the experimental data on the @xmath2-meson involved processes , one can get a possible range for the parameter @xmath4 and a determined behavior for the @xmath2-meson da . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we discuss the @xmath0 tff at the maximum recoil region and present a detailed comparison of it with the pqcd estimation and the experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , by applying the lcsr on @xmath1 , we study the ckm matrix element @xmath6 together with its uncertainties by adopting two types of processes , i.e. the @xmath7-type and the @xmath8-type . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that a smaller @xmath9 shows a better agreement with the experimental value on @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the case of @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath11 and @xmath12 , whose first ( second ) uncertainty comes from the squared average of the mentioned theoretical ( experimental ) uncertainties . </S>"
