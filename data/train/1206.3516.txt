    "within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) the gauge couplings unify nearly perfectly around an energy scale of approximately @xmath3 gev , if susy particles exist with masses of the order of @xmath4 tev .",
    "extending the mssm with non - singlet superfields tends to destroy this attractive feature , unless ( a ) the additional fields come in complete @xmath5 multiplets or ( b ) the standard model gauge group is extended too . here",
    "we study a model in which the sm group is enlarged to @xmath6 .",
    "it is a variant of the models first proposed in @xcite and later discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "our main motivation for studying this model can be summarized as : ( i ) it unifies , in the same way the mssm does , even if the scale of @xmath0 breaking is as low as the electro - weak scale ; ( ii ) it can be easily embedded into an @xmath1 grand unified theory ; ( iii ) it has the right ingredients to explain neutrino masses ( and angles ) by either an inverse @xcite or a linear @xcite seesaw ; ( iv ) it allows for higgs masses significantly larger than the mssm without the need for a very heavy susy spectrum @xcite and ( v ) it potentially leads to rich phenomenology at the lhc .    with the data accumulated in 2011 both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have seen some indications for a higgs boson with a mass of roughly @xmath7 gev .",
    "this result , perhaps unsurprisingly , has triggered an avalanche of papers studying the impact of such a relatively hefty higgs on the supersymmetric parameter space @xcite .",
    "the general consensus seems to be , that the mssm can generate @xmath7 gev only if squarks and gluinos have masses in the multi - tev range .",
    "while this is , of course , perfectly consistent with the lower bounds on susy masses obtained from searches at the lhc @xcite , such a heavy spectrum could make it quite difficult indeed for the lhc to find direct signals for susy .",
    "there are , of course , several possibilities to circumvent this conclusion .",
    "first of all , it is well - known that the loop corrections to @xmath8 are dominated by the top quark - squark loops .",
    "thus , little or no constraints on sleptons and on squarks of the first two generations can in fact be derived from higgs mass measurements , once the assumption of universal boundary conditions for the soft susy parameters is abandoned .",
    "second , in the next - to - minimal ssm ( nmssm ) the @xmath8 can be heavier than in the mssm due to the presence of new f - terms from the additional singlet higgs @xcite , especially in models with non - universal boundary conditions for the ( soft ) higgs mass terms @xcite or in the generalized nmssm @xcite . and , third , in models with an extended gauge group additional @xmath9-terms contribute to the higgs mass matrices , relaxing the mssm upper limit considerably @xcite .",
    "this latter possibility is the case we have studied in a previous paper @xcite using the minimal @xmath0 models of @xcite . here , we extend the analysis of @xcite , including both higgs and susy phenomenology .",
    "due to the extended gauge structure the model necessarily has more higgses than the mssm .",
    "near d - flatness of the @xmath10 breaking then results in one additional light higgs , @xmath11 @xcite . mixing between the mssm @xmath12 and @xmath11 enhances the mass of the mostly mssm higgs and , potentially , affects its decays .",
    "this is reminiscent to the situation in the nmssm , where an additional light and mostly singlet higgs state seems to be preferred @xcite if the signals found by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite are indeed due to a 125 gev higgs .",
    "the mssm - like @xmath13 in our model can have some exotic decays .",
    "for example , the @xmath13 will decay to two lighter higgses , if kinematically possible , although this decay can never be dominant due to constraints coming from lep .",
    "the model also includes right - handed neutrinos with electro - weak scale masses and there is a small but interesting part in parameter space where @xmath14 , where the higgs decays to two neutrinos .",
    "these decays always lead to one light and one heavy neutrino , with the latter decaying promptly to either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "( mostly right ) sneutrinos can be lighter than the @xmath13 , in which case the higgs can have invisible decays .",
    "the susy spectrum of the model is also richer than the mssm : it has seven neutralinos and nine sneutrino states .",
    "these additional sneutrinos can easily be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and thus change all the constraints on susy parameter space , usually derived from the requirement that the neutralino be a good dark matter candidate with the correct relic density @xcite . even though the lightest sneutrino can also be the lsp in the mssm , direct detection experiments have ruled out this possibility a long time ago @xcite . in susy",
    "decays , within the mssm right squarks decay directly to the bino - like neutralino , leading to the standard missing momentum signature of supersymmetry . due to the extended gauge group",
    ", right squarks can decay also to heavier neutralinos , leading to longer decay chains and potentially to multiple lepton edges .",
    "decays of the heavier neutralinos also produce higgses , both the @xmath13 and the @xmath11 appear , with ratios depending on the right higgsino content of the neutralinos in the decay chains .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the setup of the model , its particle content , superpotential and soft terms and the symmetry breaking .",
    "the phenomenologically most interesting mass matrices of the spectrum are given in section [ sec : masses ] where we also discuss numerical results on the susy and higgs mass eigenstates .",
    "here , we focus on higgs and slepton / sneutrino masses , which are the phenomenologically most interesting . in section [ sec : decays ] we define some benchmark points for the model and discuss their phenomenologically most interesting decay chains .",
    "we then close with a short summary . in the appendix we give mass matrices not presented in the text , formulas for the 1-loop corrections in the higgs sector and more information about the calculation of the rges , including anomalous dimensions as well as the 1-loop @xmath17 functions for gauge couplings and gauginos .",
    "in this section we present the particle content of the model , its superpotential and discuss the symmetry breaking .",
    "we consider the simplest model based on the gauge group @xmath19 .",
    "we will call this the mblr model below .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite it can emerge as the low - energy limit of a certain class of @xmath1 guts broken along the `` minimal '' left - right symmetric chain @xmath20",
    "the main virtue of this setting is that an mssm - like gauge coupling unification is achieved with a sliding @xmath21 breaking scale , i.e. this last stage can stretch down even to the electro - weak scale .",
    "different from the previous works @xcite , we assume that the first two breaking steps down to @xmath21 happen _ both _ at ( or sufficiently close to ) the gut scale .",
    "this assumption is used only for simplifying our setup , it does not lead to any interesting changes in phenomenology .",
    ".[tab : fc]the matter and higgs sector field content of the @xmath22 model .",
    "generation indices have been suppressed .",
    "the @xmath23 superfields are included to generate neutrino masses via the inverse seesaw mechanism . under matter parity ,",
    "the matter fields are odd while the higgses are even . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note , that in the couplings to the @xmath24-quarks a partial cancellation occurs in contrast to the ones to @xmath25-quarks , which get enhanced",
    ". moreover , the same feature appears in the vertex @xmath26-@xmath27-@xmath28 which leads to some interesting consequences discussed in section [ sec : susycascades ] .",
    "we find that the decays into the heavy neutrino states are always possible and have a sizable branching ratio provided tr@xmath29 . in table",
    "[ tab : zpbrs ] we summarize the most important final states of the @xmath2 for the different scenarios .",
    "as can be seen the heavy neutrino final states have always a sizable branching ratios with up to about 30 per - cent when summing over the generations .",
    "but even for rather heavy neutrinos as in blrsp5 own finds for this channel a 15 per - cent branching ratio . in several cases also channels into susy particles",
    "are open , in particular in scenarios with sneutrino lsps . in case of supersymmetric particles",
    "the final states containing sleptons or sneutrinos have the largest branching ratios .",
    "channels into neutralinos or charginos are suppressed .",
    "they proceed either via the mixing with the @xmath30 which is rather small or via the projection of the higgsino - right onto the corresponding neutralino state .",
    "the appearance of additional final states leads to a reduction of the event numbers in the most sensitive search channels , i.e. reducing cross section times branching ratio , and , thus , the bounds obtained by the lhc collaborations @xcite are less constraining in the blr model .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppmumu ] where we show the production cross section @xmath31 arround the @xmath2 resonance . in case that the width of the @xmath2 is calculated using only sm final states the cross section",
    "is increased roughly by a factor 1.6 in comparison to the case where also right handed neutrinos and susy particle contribute to the width of @xmath2 . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the main effect is due to r - neutrinos .",
    "we attribute the remaining difference to the official atlas result to slightly different values in the couplings and slightly different branching ratios of the final states .",
    "our results agree also with the ones of ref .",
    "we conclude that , although in our benchmark points we take always @xmath32  tev , a significantly lower mass is possible consistent with data .",
    "c      as discussed above , the heavy neutrino states can be produced via the @xmath2 with a considerable branching ratio of about 30 per - cent when summing over all heavy neutrinos .",
    "moreover , see below , they can also be produced in the cascade decays of supersymmetric particles . these heavy neutrinos mix with the light neutrino states implying a reduction of the couplings of the light neutrinos to the @xmath30-boson and , thus , also a reduction of the invisible width of the @xmath30-boson .",
    "taking the data from ref .",
    "@xcite this can be translated into the following condition on the @xmath33 sub - block @xmath34 , @xmath35 , of the neutrino mixing matrix : @xmath36 at the 3-@xmath37 level .",
    "we have checked that all our benchmark points fullfill this condition .",
    "the main decay modes of the heavy neutrinos are @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , provided they are kinemtically allowed . if there is no kinematical suppression we find in general the branching ratios scale like @xmath43 where we have summed over the light higgs bosons , the light neutrinos and leptons , respectively .",
    "we stress that these states are quasi - dirac neutrinos and , thus , for six heavy neutrinos at lhc the existence of up to three new particles could be established .",
    "note , that the final states containing a @xmath44-boson allow for a direct mass measurement .    beside the above decay modes , also decays into susy particle are possible if kinematics allow for it .",
    "for example we find that for blrsp4 the decay into @xmath45 are possible and have branching ratios of about 3 per - cent . in scenarios like blrsp3 , blrsp4 and blrsp5",
    "the main production of the heavy neutrinos is via the @xmath2 and , thus , a high luminosity will be required to observe such final states .      in this section",
    "we point out several features which distinguish the blr model from the usual mssm . for",
    "the sake of preparing the ground , let us first summarize the main features of the mssm relevant for the lhc , focusing for the time being on scenarios where the gluino is heavier than the squarks : ( i ) the gluino decays dominantly into squarks and quarks .",
    "( ii ) l - squarks and l - sleptons decay dominantly into the chargino and the neutralino which are mainly @xmath46-gauginos .",
    "apart from kinematical effects the branching ratio for decays into the charged wino divided by the branching ratio into the neutral wino is about 2:1 .",
    "( iii ) r - squarks and r - sleptons decay dominantly into the bino - like neutralino with a branching ratio often quite close to 100 per - cent .",
    "( iv ) in case of third generation sfermions also decays into higgsinos are important .    in the blr model one",
    "has two main new features : ( i ) there are additional neutralinos and ( ii ) the sneutrino sector is enlarged as well .",
    "the latter implies that sneutrino lsps are possible consistent with all astrophysical constraints and direct dark matter searches @xcite .",
    "this feature is for example realised in study points blrsp1 and blrsp3 from 1.05 to 1.0475 without changing the collider features of blrsp1 . ] .",
    "let us start the discussion with blrsp1 .",
    "in this point the four lighter neutralinos are the usual mssm neutralinos with the standard hierarchy .",
    "the fifth state corresponds to the additional @xmath47-gaugino , which we call @xmath48 , whereas the two additional states are the additional higgsinos .",
    "note that the lighest neutralino is not stable anymore but decays into final states containing all nine neutrinos as well as the three lightest sneutrinos .",
    "of the latter ones the second lightest is so long lived that it will lead to a displaced vertex in a typical collider detector .",
    "the third sneutrino decays dominatly via three - body decays into @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as discussed in section [ sec : heavyneutrinos ] the heavy neutrinos decay dominantly into @xmath44-bosons and charged leptons , thus the decays of the lightest neutralino are _ not _ invisible .",
    "@xmath48 appears for example in the decays of @xmath53 and @xmath54 with branching ratios br(@xmath55 and br(@xmath56 . for completeness",
    "we remark that the decays of @xmath57 and @xmath58 into @xmath59 is suppressed as the corresponding coupling is supressed as are the couplings of @xmath2 to @xmath24-type quarks in this model .",
    "@xmath59 decays dominantly into sleptons and sneutrinos .",
    "combining all the above together one gets a much richer structure for the decays of the r - squarks , e.g.  the following decay chains : @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "of course , several other combinations are possible as well .    from equations  ( [ eq : rsquarktoz ] ) to ( [ eq :",
    "rsquarktoz2 ] ) one sees immediatly that the standard signature of r - squarks , namely jet and missing energy , is only realized in a few cases in this study point , e.g.  if in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsquarktoz ] ) the @xmath30 decays into neutrinos .",
    "interestingly , the chain via @xmath59 into sleptons leads to a characteristic edge in the invariant mass of the lepton which can be used to determine the corresponding masses once combined with information from other decay chains .",
    "also in the study points blrsp2 and blrsp5 @xmath53 and @xmath54 decay into heavy neutralinos , which contain sizable content of the extra @xmath47 gaugino , with a sizable branching ratio . however , there the situation is somewhat less involved as in these study points the lightest bino - like neutralino is the lsp .",
    "another interesting feature is , that @xmath59 decays also into the heavier sneutrinos which themselves decay into the lsp plus @xmath63 .",
    "similarely @xmath63 can be produced in the decays of the heavy neutrinos implying that this state can be produced with sizable rate in susy cascade decays . however",
    ", as the corresponding final states are quite complicated a dedicated monte carlo study will be necessary to decide if this is indeed a discovery channel for @xmath63 .",
    "from the point of view of susy cascade decays blrsp2 looks essentially like a standard mssm point .",
    "inspection of the spectrum shows that @xmath64 is essentially a higgsino corresponding to the extended @xmath47 sector but it shows hardly up in the cascade decays .",
    "its main production channel is via an @xmath65-channel @xmath2 but even in this case the corresponding cross section is so low that it will not be dedected at the lhc even with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath66 .",
    "another interesting feature shows up in the decays of @xmath67 which is mainly the neutral wino and gets copiously produced in the decays of the l - squarks : it decays with about 77 ( 15 ) per - cent into @xmath63 ( @xmath68 ) , implying that the cascade decays are an important source of higgs bosons .    in case of blrsp3 one",
    "has sneutrino lsps like in blrsp1 but with a different hierarchy in the spectrum , as the three lightest sleptons are lighter then the lighest neutralino .",
    "therefore the @xmath69 has also sizable decay rates into charged sleptons which sum to about 30 per - cent .",
    "the sleptons decay then further into @xmath70 and @xmath71 via 3-body decays into @xmath72-pairs .",
    "the latter , however , are rather soft due to the small mass difference .",
    "in addition we have the decay channel into a light neutrino and one of the heavier sneutrinos which themselves decay into a lighter sneutrino and either one of the higgs boson or the @xmath30-boson .",
    "putting again all these decays together one obtains for the @xmath73 decays @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the decays of the r - squarks show again a more complicated structure compared to the usual cmssm expectations .",
    "channels ( [ eq : h1part1 ] ) and ( [ eq : h1part2 ] ) give @xmath63 in about 15 per - cent of the final states of @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , @xmath64 and @xmath77 decay dominantly into sleptons and sneutrinos . here",
    "a new feature is found for @xmath77 , as also the following chains @xmath78 gives rise to sharp edge structures .",
    "however , as the main final states of @xmath30 and @xmath79 are two jets , the feasability still needs to be investigated .",
    "in blrsp4 we have chosen @xmath80  gev in order to construct an lsp which is essentially a @xmath81 . here , the @xmath82-sleptons are lighter than @xmath64 , which is essentially bino - like in this point , giving rise to the following decay chain of the down - type @xmath82-squarks @xmath83 nearly all cascade decays end in a @xmath64 or one of the lighter sleptons . due to the fact , that in this particular case the additional sneutrino states are hardly produced , it might be difficult to disthinguish it from the nmssm , at least as long as the @xmath2 is not discovered .",
    "the heavier @xmath84-sleptons do not show up in the cascade decays of squarks and gluinos but can be produced via the @xmath2 as discussed in section [ tab : zpbrs ] .",
    "blrsp5 is similar to blrsp1 but compatible with pure gut conditions , e.g.  @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not input in this case put derived quantities . to fullfill the tadpole equations we have to choose @xmath87 and @xmath88 if we want a relatively low @xmath89  gev while @xmath90  gev .",
    "the choice of @xmath91 leads automatically to large masses for the heavy neutrinos such that the lightest higgs can not decay into those states .",
    "as in blrsp1 the down - type @xmath82-squarks decay not only into @xmath73 but also into @xmath92 with a branching ratio of about 13 per - cent . for completeness",
    ", we note that here @xmath93 .",
    "however this state gets hardly produced in any of the susy decays or via the @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that lhc will miss it and also at a linear collider such as ilc or clic it will be difficult to study , due to the small production cross section .",
    "we have studied the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 extension of the standard model .",
    "the model is minimal in the sense that the extended gauge symmetry is broken with the minimal number of higgs fields . in the matter",
    "sector the model contains ( three copies of ) a superfield @xmath94 , to cancel anomalies .",
    "adding three singlet superfields @xmath95 allows to generate small neutrino masses with an inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "the phenomenology of the model differs from the mssm in a number of interesting aspects .",
    "we have foccused on the higgs phenomenology and discussed changes in susy spectra and decays with respect to the mssm .",
    "the model is less constrained then the cmssm from the possible measurement of a higgs with a mass of the order of 125 gev .",
    "if the hints found in lhc data @xcite is indeed correct our model predicts two relatively light states should exist , with the second @xmath8 corresponding ( mostly ) to the lightest of the `` right '' higgses , added to break the extended gauge group .    it is interesting , as we have discussed , that very often a right sneutrino is found to be the lsp .",
    "this will affect all constraints on cmssm parameter space derived from constraints on the dark matter abundance .",
    "in fact , if the right sneutrino is indeed the lsp in our model , no constraint on any cmssm parameters can be derived from dm constraints .",
    "the model has new d - terms in all scalar mass matrices , which can lead to sizeable changes in the susy spectra , of potential phenomenological interest .",
    "we have discussed a few benchmark points , covering a number of features which could allow to distinguish the model from the cmssm .",
    "obviously this includes the discovery of a @xmath2 at the lhc where we have shown that the current bounds from lhc data depend on the details of the particle spectrum .",
    "also the cascade decays of supersymmetric particles can be significantly more involved than in the usual cmssm as the additional neutralinos , neutrinos and sneutrinos lead to enhancement of the multiplicities in the final states .",
    "this implies that the existing limits on the cmssm parameter space get modified as standard final states have reduced branching ratios and at the same time additional final states are present . in case that the mblr model is indeed realized these new cascade decays will offer additional kinematical information on the particle spectrum .",

    "it is necessary to calculate all possible 1-loop diagrams for the one- and two - point functions .",
    "as example we here give the corresponding expressions for the one - loop corrections of the tadpoles as well as the self - energy for the scalar higgs fields .",
    "for all other self - energies we refer to the output of sarah .",
    "the results are expressed via passarino veltman integrals @xcite .",
    "the basic integrals are @xmath153\\biggl [ ( q - p)^2-m_2 ^ 2+i\\varepsilon\\biggr ] } } \\thickspace , \\label{b0 def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the renormalization scale @xmath154 . all the other ,",
    "necessary functions can be expressed by @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "for instance , @xmath157~,\\ ] ] and @xmath158 the numerical evalution of all loop - integrals is performed by spheno . with this conventions",
    "we can write the one - loop tadpoles as @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "@xmath161 denotes the vertex of the three particles @xmath162 , @xmath163 @xmath164 , while @xmath165 will be used for four - point interactions .",
    "for chiral couplings we use @xmath166 as coefficient of the left and @xmath167 as coefficient of the right polarization operator .",
    "for instance , @xmath168 is the coupling of a pure down - type higgs to a @xmath30 boson while @xmath169 corresponds to the left - chiral part of the interaction of a @xmath82-higgs to a neutralino of the second generation .",
    "the expressions for all vertices can be obtained with sarah .",
    "+ using these conventions the self - energy for the scalar higgs fields reads @xmath170      the calculation of the renormalization group equations performed by sarahis based on the generic expression of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the results of @xcite are used to include the effect of kinetic mixing .",
    "+ the @xmath17 functions for the parameters of a general superpotential written as @xmath171 can be easily obtained from the shown results for the anomalous dimensions by using the relations @xcite @xmath172 for the results of the other parameters as well as for the two - loop results which we skip here because of their length we suggest to use the function calcrges [ ] of sarah .",
