    "in recent years , several types of superconducting qubits have been experimentally proposed.@xcite these systems consist on mesoscopic josephson devices and they are promising candidates to be used for the design of qubits for quantum computation.@xcite indeed , a large effort is devoted to succeed in the coherent manipulation of their quantum states in a controlable way .",
    "the progress made in this case allows to have nowadays josephson circuits with small dissipation and large decoherence times.@xcite very recently , it has been proposed that , due to these developments , it could also be possible to use mesoscopic josephson devices for the study of the quantum signatures of classically chaotic systems.@xcite in ref .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the device for the josephson flux qubit ( djfq ) has been studied . in particular , it has been discussed how the fidelity ( or loschmidt echo)@xcite of the djfq could be studied experimentally for energies corresponding to the hard chaos regime in the classical limit . here , we extend the work of ref .   by analyzing the possibility of studying , in the djfq , the mixed chaos regime ( i.e. , the energy range where there is a coexistence of chaotic and regular orbits in the classical limit ) . to this end , standard tools of analysis of `` quantum chaos '' , like spectral statistics @xcite and phase space distributions,@xcite will be used .",
    "it is by now well established that from the analysis of the spectral properties of quantum systems in the semiclassical regime it is possible to obtain information about the underlying dynamics of the classical counterpart .",
    "@xcite the probability distribution @xmath2 of the spacings @xmath3 between successive energy levels - the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath2- unveils information on the associated classical dynamics . for integrable systems the levels",
    "are uncorrelated , and @xmath2 obeys a poisson distribution .",
    "for completely chaotic classical motion , @xmath2 follows the prediction of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite and when time reversal symmetry is preserved @xmath2 is closely approximated by the wigner distribution for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , @xmath4.@xcite    generic quantum systems do not conform to the above special cases , the classical phase space typically presents mixed dynamics , with coexistence of regular orbits and chaotic motion.@xcite in this generic case berry and robnik @xcite proposed an analytical expression for the corresponding @xmath2 , based on the knowledge of pure classical quantities related to the liouville measure of the chaotic and regular classical regions .",
    "the idea behind their calculations is that each regular or irregular phase space region gives rise to its own sequence of energy levels . for each region the level density results proportional to the liouville measure of the classical region and the associated level spacing distribution",
    "follows the poisson or the wigner form for regular and chaotic regions respectively . in the semiclassical limit",
    "these sequences of energy levels can be supposed independent and the complete distribution @xmath2 is obtained by their random superposition .",
    "several works have studied numerically the level statistics in systems with mixed dynamics . @xcite",
    "systems with two degrees of freedom have been analyzed by several groups , mostly quartic oscillators@xcite and billiards,@xcite and in some works the berry - robnik proposal has been tested in detail.@xcite    in contrast to the level statistics , the wave functions of quantum chaotic systems have remained relatively less explored .",
    "in particular the analysis of wave functions in phase space representations , such as the wigner function @xcite or the husimi distribution , @xcite allows a direct comparison between the classical and the quantum dynamics .",
    "of particular interest are the zeros of the husimi distribution which seem to be organized along regular lines or fill space regions for regular or chaotic classical dynamics respectively . @xcite    besides the importance of visualizing the dynamical properties of quantum systems in phase space , techniques for measuring these functions , referred as",
    " quantum tomography \" @xcite are subjects of active research in many experimental systems , like ion traps , optical lattices , entangled photons,@xcite and also superconducting qubits.@xcite    josephson junctions have been used for the study of classical chaos since the early 1980s.@xcite a single underdamped junction with a periodic current drive can become chaotic in a wide range of parameter values.@xcite several experiments have indeed studied this problem and measured chaotic properties in current - voltage curves and in voltage noise in josephson junctions.@xcite moreover , networks with several junctions have been proposed for the study of spatio - temporal chaos.@xcite all this cases correspond to classical chaos in dissipative systems with a time - periodic drive . much less studied has been the case of classical hamiltonian chaos in josephson junctions,@xcite mainly due to the fact that dissipation through a shunt resistance and/or coupling to the external measuring circuitry is typically important . for the same reason , _",
    "i.e. _ , the difficulty in fabricating josephson circuits with negligible coupling to the environment , few examples of quantum chaos in josephson systems are found in the literature .",
    "one of them is the work of graham _",
    "et al._,@xcite who considered dynamical localization and level repulsion in a single josephson junction with a time periodic drive .",
    "more recently t. d. clark , m. j. everitt and coworkers@xcite explored chaos and the quantum behaviour of squid rings coupled to electromagnetic field modes .",
    "the recent development of josephson devices for quantum computation , which need large coherence times , lead to significant advances in the fabrication of circuits with small coupling to the external circuit and negligible dissipation .",
    "this opened the possibility of using this type of mesoscopic devices for the study of quantum chaos .",
    "for example , montangero _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed recently a josephson nanocircuit as a realization of the quantum kicked rotator .",
    "the difficulty in realizing experimentally their system resides in that it needs to move mechanically one superconducting node in a high - frequency periodic motion .",
    "a different proposal has been put forward in ref .",
    ", where it has been shown that the device for the josephson flux qubit ( djfq),@xcite which consists on a three - junction squid , is classically chaotic at high energies . it could be therefore possible to use this system for the experimental study of quantum signatures of classical chaos .",
    "one possibility is the analysis of the fidelity or loschmidt echo@xcite in the quantum dynamics.@xcite an experimental setup for the measurement of the loschmidt echo in the djfq has been proposed in ref .. in the above mentioned work , the system is prepared initially with a wave packet@xcite localized in coordinate ( phase ) and momentum ( charge ) with an energy corresponding to the regime of hard chaos in the classical limit .",
    "the quantum evolution of the wave packet is evaluated in the unperturbed and the perturbed hamiltonians , and the overlap of the two evolved wave functions defines the loschmidt echo or fidelity@xcite , which can be measured experimentally.@xcite different behavior could be observed if the wave packet is initially localized in a chaotic or in a regular region of the phase space .",
    "therefore , an interesting case to analyze is when the wave packet is prepared initially with an energy within the regime where there is a mixed phase space in the classical limit . in this case",
    ", one would expect that the behavior of the loschmidt echo could depend on the location of the average coordinate and momentum of the initial wave packet .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "it has been found a strong dependence of the fidelity with the initial state for mixed dynamics in the phase space in the case of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "however , in order to be sensitive to the structure of phase space in the case of mixed dynamics , it is necessary to have a small effective @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze the quantum spectra and wave functions of the djfq in order to obtain for which values of the effective @xmath1 the quantum physics of this system can show signatures of the structure of the phase space in the case of mixed dynamics . to this end , we will use standard tools of quantum chaos theory by calculating numerically the level statistics of the djfq for different effective @xmath1 and the husimi distribution .    concerning the spectral analysis ,",
    "the quantum signatures of chaos have been discussed through the @xmath2 distribution in ref . for a squid with three junctions in the hard chaos regime .",
    "however , the case with only on - site capacitances was considered there ( the capacitance of the junctions was neglected ) . nevertheless , the device for the josephson flux qubit fabricated by the delft goup@xcite has small on - site capacitances , about two orders of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic capacitances of the junctions.@xcite this fact turns the model hamiltonian for the djfq to be different from the one studied in refs .. one of the goals of this paper is to analyze the spectral properties of the djfq considering realistic values of the different capacitances to analyze the device for the josephson flux qubit ( djfq ) in the case of mixed dynamics .",
    "in addition we analyze the structure of the husimi functions for the djfq , an issue that has been so far unexplored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[model ] we introduce the quantum model for the device for the josephson flux qubit . before presenting the quantum spectral analysis",
    ", we will study in sec .",
    "[ qchaos ] the dynamics of its classical analog .",
    "the presence of chaos will be characterized through the analysis of a measure of the chaotic volume , that will be defined and obtained as a function of the energy .",
    "we devote the rest of sec .",
    "[ qchaos ] to the analysis of the spectral properties .",
    "the nns distribution will be obtained for different energies corresponding to different classical energy regions and dynamics and for different values of the effective @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "[ distri ] we compute the husimi distribution for the djfq in order to characterize the localization of the quantum states on typical phase space structures related to the different classical regimes . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] we summarize our results and discuss possible experimental characterizations of the quantum manifestations of chaos in this system .",
    "the djfq consists of three josephson junctions in a superconducting ring @xcite that encloses a magnetic flux @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , see fig.[djfq_fig ] .     and",
    "@xmath7 have josepshon energy @xmath8 and capacitance @xmath9 , and junction @xmath10 has josepshon energy and capacitance @xmath11 times smaller .",
    "the arrows indicate the sign convention for defining the gauge invariant phase differences .",

    "the junctions have gauge invariant phase differences defined as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectivily , with the sign convention corresponding to the directions indicated by the arrows in fig.[djfq_fig ] . typically the circuit inductance can be neglected and the phase difference of the third junction is : @xmath16 .",
    "therefore the system can be described with two dynamical variables : @xmath17 .",
    "the circuits that are used for the josephson flux qubit have two of the junctions with the same coupling energy , @xmath18 , and capacitance , @xmath19 , while the third junction has smaller coupling @xmath20 and capacitance @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "the above considerations lead to the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath23 where the two - dimensional coordinate is @xmath24 .",
    "the potential energy is given by the josephson energy of the circuit and , in units of @xmath8 , is : @xmath25 the kinetic energy term is given by the electrostatic energy of the circuit , where the two - dimensional momentum is @xmath26 and @xmath27 is an effective mass tensor determined by the capacitances of the circuit , @xmath28 with @xmath29 we included in @xmath27 the on - site capacitance @xmath30 .",

    "is operated at magnetic fields near the half - flux quantum ( @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ) . for values of @xmath50 , the potential eq.([eq : pot ] )",
    "has two well defined minima . at the optimal operation point @xmath51 , the two lowest ( degenerated ) energy states are symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of two states corresponding to macroscopic persistent currents of opposite sign .",
    "the offset value @xmath52 determines the level splitting between these two states .",
    "these eigenstates are energetically separated from the others ( for small @xmath52 ) and therefore the djfq has been used as a qubit @xcite ( _ i.e. _ a two - level truncation of the hilbert space is performed ) .",
    "in addition the barrier for quantum tunneling between the states depends strongly on value of @xmath11 and its height goes up as @xmath11 is increased . the possibility to manipulate the potential landscape by changing @xmath11 is a crucial point for experimental implementation of qubits .",
    "typical experiments in djfq have values of @xmath11 in the range @xmath53.@xcite    as we will discuss here , the higher energy states of the djfq show quantum manifestations of classical chaos . in what follows we focus our study of the djfq considering the realistic case of : ( i ) small on - site capacitances , taking @xmath54 , ( ii ) a magnetic field corresponding to the optimal operation point of the djfq , @xmath51 , and ( iii ) the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in coincidence with the experimental values employed in ref . .",
    "before entering into the analysis of the quantum spectra we will focus on the classical dynamics of the djfq . as we already anticipated in the introduction , generic systems present mixed classical dynamics and",
    "the djfq is not the exception .",
    "therefore for a given energy @xmath57 our aim is to estimate the chaotic volume @xmath58 , defined as the probability of having a chaotic orbit ( i.e. lyapunov exponent @xmath59 ) at energy @xmath57 . as we will show below",

    "we estimate the chaotic volume @xmath58 using @xmath68 initial conditions chosen randomly with uniform probability within the available phase space for each given energy . also the average lyapunov exponent , @xmath69 , of the chaotic orbits is obtained .",

    "the soft chaos behavior is evident by the structure of the poincar sections , in which regular islands are sorrounded by chaotic regions .",
    "the localization of the states on classical structures like already distroyed chains of islands is observed in the figures .",

    "the above analysis of the husimi distributions shows that for @xmath103 , it is possible to use localized wave packets as initial conditions for the experimental measurement of the loschmidt echo,@xcite since they can sense the structure of the phase space with mixed classical dynamics in this case.@xcite    .",

    "in this paper we have characterized the quantum signatures of chaos in the three - junction squid device . for realistic parameter values",
    "the classical dynamics exhibits different regimes that go from mixed dynamics to fully developed chaotic motion . as a consequence",
    "the spectral statistics , characterized by the distribution of the nearest neigbour energy spacing ( nns ) @xmath2 in the high energy region , is expected to unveil signatures of the mentioned behavior .",
    "the analysis has been performed for different energy regions inside the classical intervals corresponding both to the soft chaos ( _ i.e. _ , mixed phase space ) and hard chaos regimes , and we considered the even - even parity states to compute the nns distribution .",
    "our numerical results show that , for @xmath128 ( and for @xmath103 in particular ) , in a nearly semiclassical regime , @xmath2 is well fitted by berry - robnik like formulae , where the pure classical measures of the chaotic and regular regions have been used as the only free parameters .",
    "we also found that the individual eigenstates can also be intimately linked to the phase space structures that characterizes the different classical regimes for @xmath184 . in order to analyze how",
    "quantum states are supported or localized on different classical structures that are present in the different regimes in this case , we have investigated the husimi phase space distributions for different eigenstates with energies @xmath153 in the classical interval .",
    "we would like to mention that there are few studies of husimi distributions for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , @xcite as it is the case of the dfjq studied in the present work .",
    "one important advantage of josephson junction devices is that they can be fabricated with well - controlled parameters .",
    "the effective @xmath1 , is @xmath185 , and since @xmath186 and @xmath187 , with @xmath188 the area of the junctions , we have that @xmath189 .",
    "thus , the fabrication of different djfq with junctions with varying area could allow to study cases with @xmath190 spanning from the semiclassical to the quantum regime .",
    "this is indeed important since different regimes can be accessed experimentally depending on the magnitude of @xmath85 .",
    "the qubit regime of two - level dynamics of the djfq is observed experimentally in devices with @xmath191.@xcite in ref .",
    "it has been found that signatures of chaos in the loschmidt echo can be observed at high energies @xmath192 in devices with an effective @xmath1 of the order of @xmath193 .",
    "here we have shown that the observation of the quantum effects in the case with mixed chaotic and regular orbits ( for an intermediate energy range ) needs the study of devices in a more semiclassical regime with @xmath194 .",
    "this could motivate experimental measurements looking for the dependence of the loschmidt echo@xcite with initial conditions , due to the phase space structure of the mixed classical dynamics , if the experiments are performed in devices with @xmath194 .",
    "considering the values@xcite of @xmath195 and the operation temperature of @xmath196 m@xmath197 reported by the delft group @xcite , typical level spacings of @xmath198 m@xmath199 can be experimentally resolved in the device of ref .. this energy resolution is enough for the case of the loschmidt echo in devices with @xmath200 , analyzed originally in ref .. however , the semiclassical regime explored in this work ( @xmath103 ) requires a resolution in the level spacings of the order of @xmath201 .",
    "thus , for experiments in the cryogenic range ( @xmath196 m@xmath197 ) devices with larger values of @xmath8 should be employed . on one hand , a smaller @xmath202 already requires junctions with larger area @xmath188 , and therefore larger @xmath8 . on the other hand , josephson junctions fabricated with high @xmath203 superconductors@xcite",
    "can have a large @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , devices designed with high @xmath203 superconductors can be good candidates for the experimental challenge of studying the mixed phase space in the semiclassical regime of the djfq .",
    "another possible type of experiment is to start the system in the ground state and apply a constant pulse in some external parameter ( for instance , the magnetic field ) .",
    "after the pulse is applied , the probability of remaining in the ground state could be related to the energy level statistics.@xcite also , an interesting experiment could be to perform studies of the low frequency noise , as it has been done in mesoscopic chaotic cavities.@xcite for example , one could drive the djfq into the hard chaos regime with a voltage source such that @xmath204 ( and @xmath205 ) and then measure the noise in the current . how the current noise is related to the spectral statistics in this case",
    "is a very interesting problem , which could be the subject of future studies .",
