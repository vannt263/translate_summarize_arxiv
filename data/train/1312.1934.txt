    "<S> in a classic paper zeeman introduced the @xmath0-twist spin of a knot @xmath1 and showed that the exterior of a twist spin fibers over @xmath2 . in particular this result shows that the knot @xmath3 is doubly slice . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath0-twist spin of @xmath1 also gives rise to two metabolizers for @xmath3 and we determine these two metabolizers precisely . </S>"
