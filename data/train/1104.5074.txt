    "transient radio sky or time - variable radio sources in space have been recognized as one of the key science drivers for the square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite what will be reflected in its design and operations @xcite .",
    "this science area is marked as `` exploration of the unknown '' what includes the likely discovery of new classes of objects and phenomena . yet",
    "the statistical properties of transient radio sky remain largely unknown , what includes even the high - energy transients as they seem to be unfolding on very short time scales .    in detection approach for the arrays such as mwa , lofar and ska we propose to acknowledge the need for reducing data transport and computational cost while searching for fast transients .",
    "therefore , we suggest that such detection needs to be done in stages with reduced data for storing and transporting at every consequent stage .",
    "firstly , the presence of the abrupt change in raw time - domain data needs to be identified .",
    "secondly , the evidences of the extraterrestrial nature of the detected signal need to be found .",
    "thirdly , if such evidence is present , more detailed analysis can be applied . in this paper",
    "we present an attempt to develop a reliable and cost - effective technique for the first stage of detection using statistical signal detection approach .",
    "the proposed method of handling received time domain sequences is based on online abrupt changes detection scheme .",
    "the algorithm operates in time domain and is required to identify the onset of the signal by checking if the threshold of the detection process has been reached .",
    "let s consider the signal with the following structure : @xmath0 where _ t _ is time , _",
    "( _ t _ ) @xmath1 is a gaussian noise process with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 , _",
    "s_(_t _ ) @xmath4 is a gaussian signal with mean @xmath5 and variance @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 since we assume that signal and noise are independent .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are hypothesis under which the signal of interest is either absent ( hypothesis @xmath9 ) or present ( @xmath10 ) along with the additive background noise n(t ) . as we demonstrate further , the proposed utilization of algorithm known as cumulative sum ( cusum ) introduced by @xcite allows for mean only parameter to be sufficient when building a detector",
    ".    changes detection scheme , used ino transient identification algorithm , is based on two generic detection procedures : log likelihood ratio ( llr ) and cusum .",
    "llr test is based on using a ratio of two @xmath11 to build an indicator upon which a threshold can be applied .",
    "if the ratio exceeds given threshold , it indicates the prevalence of one of the hypothesis over another .",
    "lr for a gauss - distributed data using the model given in ( [ eq2 ] ) is : @xmath12 we consider identification successful when @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a predefined threshold for identification .",
    "llr is obtained by taking logarithm of ( [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath15 equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can now be expressed through either mean- or variance - based detector .    in the latter case ,",
    "assuming equal and zero mean , we obtain : @xmath16    assuming equal and unity variance , ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes : @xmath17 .",
    "thus , defining @xmath18 and rescaling the log likelihood expression by the proportionality value ( @xmath19 ) to obtain a threshold value .",
    "if the probability of type i error @xmath20 is fixed , the detection threshold can be expressed as @xmath21 .",
    "cusum is a detection procedure proposed by @xcite .",
    "cusum is a repeated llr test for a change from one known distribution to another .",
    "we assume that for known densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 there exists an unknown change point @xmath24 , where the input sequence @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "the cusum statistics is the one that satisfies the following recursion : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a likelihood ratio for @xmath31 evaluated at @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure raises an alarm at time @xmath33 for threshold @xmath34 , which is discussed later .    if likelihood value from ( [ eq5 ] ) used with regard to variances",
    ", the cusum recursion would take the following form , based on the usual radiometric output being the averaged sum of the samples squares or the energy detector : @xmath35 with the parameter @xmath36 denoting variance - based coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "since it relies on the full knowledge of variances of the signal and noise , it is not always practical to use cusum algorithm with the recursion denoted in ( [ eq21 ] ) .    applying ( [ eq13 ] ) cusum may be expressed as a procedure , which starts with @xmath38 , it recursively calculates : @xmath39 and stops as soon as @xmath40 exceeds threshold @xmath34 .    generally speaking , equation ( [ eq23 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath41 , where @xmath36 being a configurable parameter .",
    "choice of this parameter is ruled by the expected behavior of the procedure , as stated by @xcite : `` scoring is chosen so that the mean sample path on the chart when quality is satisfactory is downwards  and is upwards when quality is unsatisfactory '' .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite the optimal value for parameter r will be the largest acceptable mean value or the smallest unacceptable mean value .",
    "one of the benefits of cusum scheme for signal detection is its stability in the presence of regression behavior in input data @xcite , which is due to the gradual changes in the system temperature or changes of the overall sky temperature for large field of view or `` all - sky '' telescopes .",
    "choice between mean - based and variance - based cusum schemes depends on the type of the receiver used . for a linear output receiver ,",
    "sampled according to nyquist , the output represents voltage changes with time .",
    "both mean- and variance - based indicator function can be used .",
    "however , mean - based indicator is preferred because it does not rely on variance - based separation of noise and signal . for full power square - law detector",
    ", however , mean - based indicator function becomes unusable due to the loss of information on mean .",
    "therefore , variance - based cusum scheme should be used discounting the utilization of mean @xcite .",
    "cusum scheme requires a threshold value @xmath34 to be chosen , which , when crossed , identifies the point of abrupt change in the statistical characteristics of the signal .",
    "threshold value @xmath34 can be derived from wald test on the mean of a normal population @xcite . assuming that @xmath42 , the value of threshold @xmath34 is equivalent to a sequence of wald sequential tests @xcite with boundaries @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath20 was interpreted by @xcite as a crude approximation to the proportion of samples that trigger false alarm .",
    "this value can also be interpreted as a probability of false alarm in a traditional sense . since we assumed that @xmath45 ( [ eq_threshold ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath46 .",
    "the algorithm was tested on the data obtained from parks radiotelescope .",
    "input data contained 1 second observation from the vela pulsar psr j0835 - 4510 .",
    "the observation was sampled at 1416 mhz with 64 mhz bandwidth .",
    "psr j0835 - 4510 has a period of 89 ms .",
    "figure  [ fig : vela_det ] represents a portion of the observed data with the detected pulses marked by vertical red lines , with blue lines representing 0.1 second intervals . out of 10 impulses contained in the test data ,",
    "9 were identified .",
    "90% of pulses being correctly identifed prove the applicability of cusum procedure described above upon the raw , time - domain radio data .",
    "detectability of a signal is controled by and relied upon the preset threshold , which is calculated based on the assumed probability distribution of data ( [ eq_threshold ] ) .    ,",
    "observed at parks telescope , central frequency @xmath47 mhz , bandwidth @xmath48 mhz , recorded with 2-bit vlbi recorder .",
    "the recording started at @xmath49 .",
    "short bars mark @xmath50 intervals .",
    "vertical red lines mark the beginning of detected pulses .",
    ", width=623,height=136 ]",
    "we have presented the algorithm , which provides reliable and computationally efficient detection of dispersed radio transients in time domain .",
    "the algorithm is well - suited for being implemented on fpga or gpu platforms for real time detection on arrays such as ska .",
    "statistical methods used in the algorithm provide easy staging of detection process across multiple handling points giving the opportunity for significant reduction of data volume at each consequent stage of detection .",
