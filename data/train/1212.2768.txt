    "a galaxy s dark matter mass is arguably the most important parameter characterizing its evolutionary state .",
    "massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) with virial masses of up to @xmath0 are those that have evolved furthest in the galaxy building process , with little gas left to make new stars . in the centers of etgs the luminous matter dominates , but already at a few half - light radii ( @xmath1 ) of the stellar distribution , dark matter ( dm ) takes over .",
    "the spatial distributions of luminous and dark matter in the inner regions of etgs are the outcome of the formation processes by which these systems were shaped , and are thus one of the observational constraints we have on these processes , next to scaling relations , stellar population properties , and orbital structure .    the following sections review first the predictions of cosmological simulations for the structure of the dark halos and baryonic components in etgs , and then what has been learnt about their dark matter halos from different techniques : lensing , hydrostatic hot x - ray gas athmospheres , and stellar dynamics of halo tracers .",
    "simulations of structure formation in a cold dark matter universe have progressed greatly over several decades ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed review ) . for the idealized case of dark matter only , without baryons , resimulations of individual halos now reach o(@xmath2 ) particles per halo .",
    "the main results from these studies are :    * mass density profiles are approximately universal , i.e. , independent of halo mass and cosmological parameters aside from scalings .",
    "the best current density profile model is a 3-parameter einasto profile @xcite . *",
    "halo concentrations are in the range @xmath3-@xmath4 with scatter at given mass @xmath5 .",

    "halo shapes are strongly flattened , prolate - triaxial .",

    "it is approximately stable at fixed radius except in major mergers , and is mostly due to anisotropy ( median @xmath7 ) @xcite . *",
    "bound substructures are abundant but not dominant , comprising @xmath8 of the halo mass .",
    "they have a steeply declining cumulative abundance distribution with mass , @xmath9 or @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "* the inner density profiles are cuspy , increasing inwards . the asymptotic inner slope is now known to be slightly shallower than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the structure of the simulated dm halos is modified by the gravitational interaction with the baryonic component , and thus indirectly by baryonic cooling , settling , star formation and feedback .",
    "the resulting modifications of the halos include :    * steepening of the halo density profile : adiabatic contraction through slow dissipative settling of gas into a disk @xcite . * flattening of the cusp by feedback and shaking @xcite . *",
    "the halo becomes more spherical and evolves towards oblate at all radii but mostly in its inner parts @xcite .",
    "* minor axes of the disk and inner halo ( @xmath12 ) align when a disk forms .",
    "the minor axis orientation of the outer halo remains unchanged . as a result",
    ", the orientations of the inner and outer halo are uncorrelated in simulations with baryons , while well - aligned in n - body - only simulations @xcite . *",
    "the angular momenta of disk and inner halo also align , whereas the median misalignment between inner and outer halo angular momenta is @xmath13-@xmath14 deg @xcite .",
    "because the halos rotate slowly , shape and angular momentum need not be tightly correlated .",
    "stacking of simulated halos washes out the alignment signal for weak lensing .",
    "high - resolution models of etgs in a cosmological setting are of particular interest for comparing with the empirical results discussed in later sections of this review .",
    "@xcite analyzed 42 galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath15-@xmath16 from the cosmological hydrodynamical resimulations of @xcite which include a model for cooling , supernova feedback , and star formation processes , but do not include agn feedback .",
    "these systems contain an in - situ component made in efficient early star formation , and later grow by accretion through mostly minor mergers .",

    "@xcite determined circular velocity curves ( cvcs ) @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the dark matter cvcs are essentially described by power laws outside radii greater than the softening radius ( @xmath19 kpc for dm particles ) .",
    "they vary systematically in that the average slope of the dark matter cvc increases with increasing circular velocity , or mass , from approximately flat at low masses to slightly rising ( @xmath20 ) at high masses . when the stellar component is added in , the total cvc slope changes from slightly falling ( @xmath21 ) at low masses to flat at high masses ( see fig .",
    "the slopes of dark matter cvcs and total cvcs correlate with n. typical dm fractions in the simulated etgs are @xmath22 at @xmath23 and @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "they increase with @xmath1 in kpc , with n , or with mass within @xmath1 ; see @xcite .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with the mass profiles determined from lensing , x - rays and dynamics , as described in the following .",

    "the weak galaxy - galaxy lensing signal for 350000 lenses ( @xmath26 ) from sdss was compared to a halo model based on simulations ( @xmath27 , nfw density profile , satellite model ) by @xcite .",
    "satisfactory agreement was found ; within this model an @xmath28 galaxy with @xmath29 is hosted by a halo of mass @xmath30 .",
    "this value is similar for etgs in high and low density regions .",
    "results from the 2 mag deeper rcs2 survey already suggested changes with redshift @xcite ; see also the talk by hudson in these proceedings .    in principle ,",
    "weak lensing is also the method of choice to measure the outer halo shapes : individual halos will have stronger shear signal on the projected major axis than on the projected minor axis .",
    "however , a measurement of this effect requires stacking of multiple galaxies . thus the signal is preserved only if halos and galaxies are aligned .",
    "simulations suggest that this is not the case and that the signal is isotropized ; see  2 .",

    "mass profiles can be determined by combining multiple systems with different @xmath31 @xcite , or by mass reconstruction methods applied to the source images @xcite .",
    "the overal result from these studies is that on average dm starts to dominate at @xmath37-@xmath38 .    by combining @xmath39 with a measured central velocity dispersion or resolved dispersion profile , it is possible to constrain the average slope of the mass density profile , @xmath40 .",

    "massive etgs must either be more dark matter dominated in their cores , or have a heavier , non - universal imf @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas in massive etgs have long been an important and independent tracer of their dm halos @xcite .",
    "the hot gas extends to large radii where the dm dominates , and the isotropic pressure makes the analysis much simpler than for stellar tracers . with",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , it is no longer a problem to measure temperature profiles .",
    "thus the current main uncertainties are whether the gas is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium , and how large are non - thermal contributions to the pressure which are not traced by the x - ray data , such as from relativistic particles , turbulent motions and magnetic fields .",
    "some of the main conclusions are as follows :    * in galaxies with x - ray luminosities @xmath46 erg / s ( depending on the optical luminosity , often lower mass systems ) the x - ray flux from the hot gas is subdominant compared to that from x - ray binaries and stars , so mass determination is unreliable @xcite . * a fraction of the more x - ray luminous systems have strongly disturbed x - ray athmospheres @xcite , so that the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption is doubtful .",

    "@xcite using data from @xcite found that the cvcs turn up at large radii , possibly due to the surrounding group dm halo , and that the typical circular velocity @xmath50 correlates with the velocity dispersion of the sub - mpc group environment . * comparing determinations of the gravitational potential or cvc for the same galaxy from x - ray and optical observations gives a way to estimate the non - thermal contributions to the total pressure .",
