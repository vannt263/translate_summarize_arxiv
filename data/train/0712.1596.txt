    "the original kaluza - klein ( kk ) method for obtaining a gauge symmetry from the compactification process introduces a mass scale of the inverse compactification radius , @xmath4 for a charge @xmath5 particle with the compactification radius @xmath6 .",
    "thus the attempt to obtain qed from the kk process is phenomenologically unsuccessful @xcite if the compactification radius is of order the planck scale .",
    "this requires the compactification process with chiral fermions so that there would be massless particles whose masses are independent of the compactification radius .",
    "the smallness of the masses of the standard model ( sm ) fields is interpreted basically due to the appearance of chiral representations in the compactification process .    while the original kk compactification on torus does not admit such chiral fermions @xcite , orbifolding of torus makes it possible to obtain chiral fermions .",
    "orbifold has been introduced first in the heterotic string theory @xcite , where the compactification process toward chiral fermions has been very successful @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions used in string orbifolds are also applicable to higher dimensional field theory where useful phenomenological consequences such as the doublet - triplet splitting have been obtained @xcite . however",
    ", orbifold field theory can not be considered a fundamental theory and it has been hoped that string orbifolds would provide some successful field theoretic orbifold models . to obtain field theoretic orbifold models with a large radius @xmath6 from string theory ,",
    "one needs two effective radii for compactification , which has led to the recent interest in nonprime orbifolds @xcite .",
    "orbifolds are tori moded out by discrete actions @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the fundamental region of an orbifold is @xmath8 of the area of the original torus . in the orbifold topology",
    ", there are fixed points which are located at the boundary of the fundamental region . a typical cartoon for for a @xmath9 orbifold is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z12i ] .    for string orbifolds",
    "the orbifold boundary conditions are used for the @xmath10 directions of the string world - sheet coordinates , and for field theoretic orbifolds the boundary conditions are used for the extra coordinates of the wave functions . in an orbifold , strings can propagate in the extra space ( untwisted string ) or located at the fixed points ( twist string ) . for a string orbifold , they are shown in fig .",

    "the kk states in four spacetime dimensions ( 4d ) have masses quantized in units of @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to obtain the explicit kk masses for the purpose of obtaining the running equations for gauge couplings . in field",
    "theoretic calculation , there is no hint how the threshold correction appears in the evolution equation @xcite . in string theory ,",
    "however , the threshold correction can be reliably calculated due to the exact knowledge on the spectrum in principle .",
    "indeed , the calculation is possible with the string partition function @xcite . as for the gauge model in six spacetime dimensions ( 6d ) compactified from 10d , a simple method is to compactify just four internal spaces ( 4d@xmath12 ) to obtain a 6d model .",
    "equivalently , it can be obtained from the 4d model by taking the limit @xmath13 . however , toward the gauge coupling running , we need the _ exact _ @xmath6 dependence of the massive 4d kk particles .",
    "so one of our objectives in this paper is to obtain the exact @xmath6 dependence of the kk modes from string compactification .    by employing the nonprime orbifold compactification of the heterotic string theory ,",
    "we obtain 5d or 6d orbifold susy guts .",
    "the kk excited states and the relevant ( relatively ) large extra dimensions should be necessarily discussed in the above framework .",
    "the radii of the extra dimensions ( @xmath6s ) should be moduli in the string orbifold compactification such that one can take the large limit of the radii . in the infinitely large limit of the extra 2d@xmath12 in a 4d model ,",
    "the theory would be expected to become an effective 6d string theory with @xmath14 or 4 susy ( in terms of 4d susy ) . a 4d @xmath15 orbifold model realizing a 6d @xmath14 theory in the limit of @xmath16 should possess a 6d orbifold model .    in the orbifold compactification",
    ", the presence of the @xmath14 susy sector implies the presence of a sub - lattice invariant under a given twist action .",
    "an invariant sub - lattice is just a torus .",
    "hence , there is no twisting for strings on the invariant sub - lattice .",
    "background moduli such as radius ( or metric ) can be encoded only in the zero modes momenta of untwisted bosonic strings  @xcite . since",
    "twisted strings are stuck to orbifold fixed points , they can not accommodate moduli . in order to introduce a modulus such as arbitrarily large radius and",
    "to discuss the relevant kk excitations , therefore , we need to employ orbifold compactification providing invariant sub - lattices  @xcite .    in nonprime orbifold compactifications ,",
    "some higher twist sectors turn out to behave like the invariant sub - lattice preserving @xmath14 susy .",
    "kk excited states can arise from such higher twist sectors in nonprime orbifold compactifications @xcite .",
    "if orbifolding is associated with gauge symmetry breaking , the gauge symmetry could be enhanced by including kk massive states above the compactification scale .",
    "hence , it is possible to construct a higher dimensional susy gut with the help of kk states . along this line , 6d susy guts based on string theory can be realized in nonprime orbifolds . as an explicit example for a concrete presentation",

    "the knowledge on the susy breaking scale is very important toward the tev scale phenomenology of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "gravity mediation needs a hidden sector confining around @xmath17 gev , while the gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) needs a hidden sector confining at a scale less than @xmath18 gev @xcite . for the 4d calculation of the unification of gauge couplings to make sense ,",
    "we assume that the 4d gut scale is below the compactification scale @xmath19 , leading to the following hierarchy @xmath20 where we have not specified the hierarchy between the string scale @xmath21 and the planck scale @xmath22 .",
    "we will employ the @xmath9 compactification model @xcite for a concrete discussion if needed . the first impression for the @xmath9 might be that it is too complicated .",

    "the final number of fields are of order 100300 .",

    "the seemingly complicated @xmath9 has only 3 fixed points and hence the @xmath9 wilson line is very simple .",
    "in addition , the @xmath9 orbifold has an invariant torus so that there results a meaningful @xmath6 dependence of the kk masses .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is a conclusion . in appendix",
    ", we present some calculations for a coefficient in the beta function .",
    "partition functions of nonprime orbifolds are the key toward introducing kk masses . as a simple example ,",
    "we take the @xmath9 orbifold model @xcite which seems to have interesting properties @xcite .",
    "our discussion here could be generalized to other nonprime orbifolds . before presenting partition functions ,",
    "let us get a physical intuition for the internal space of nonprime orbifolds .",
    "the @xmath24 orbifold is not an irreducible one , and we consider it as a direct product type orbifold @xmath25 in 4d with @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath9 shift vector we will introduce is @xmath28 which is the sum of @xmath29 and @xmath23 shifts @xmath30 in the limit @xmath13 , we may consider a 4d @xmath31 orbifold with @xmath32 where the modding is for the first and the third tori .",
    "the @xmath31 orbifold has only one fixed point at the origin , which is a kind of teardrop topology . in @xcite ,",
    "a relatively small gauge coupling for the hidden sector compared to that of the observable sector needed in some gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking is expected to arise due to the kk mode contribution , which can be studied in the 6d model .",
    "the second torus in eq .",
    "( [ shif ] ) is a @xmath23 orbifold shift and has three fixed points .",
    "but when we consider the 6d theory , the second torus is treated uncompactified as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4dint ] .",
    "the compactification radius @xmath33 of ( 12 ) and ( 56 ) tori are assumed to be close to the string scale @xmath34 and the compactification radius @xmath6 of the ( 34 ) torus is large with a hierarchy of radii @xmath35 . with the 6d@xmath12 compactified , we obtain a four dimensional ( 4d ) model for the internal space dimension and d for the uncompactified dimension . ] which must give the phenomenologically successful sm and a confining hidden sector gauge group .",
    "we are familiar with the 4d gauge group from orbifold compactification by considering massless conditions satisfying @xmath36 and @xmath37 mod z in the untwisted sector .",
    "of course , this gauge group can be obtained also by considering the common _ intersection _ of gauge groups obtained at each fixed point .",
    "what will be an appropriate approximate gauge group when the radius of the second torus tends to infinity ?",
    "the wilson line in the second torus distinguishes three fixed points there .",
    "if we do not want to distinguish the three fixed points , then we simply neglect the wilson line , and consider only @xmath36 .",
    "even though we neglect the wilson line @xmath2 , still there must be three fixed points in the second torus with the same spectrum at each fixed point .",
    "when the radius of the second torus tends to infinity , the gauge bosons moving in the torus , e.g. @xmath38 of fig .",
    "[ fig : z12i ] , are still the gauge boson .",
    "in addition , there can be additional gauge bosons . a string of the type @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : z12i ] can not be a gauge boson .",
    "but , if the fixed points are not present in some twisted sector , there can be additional gauge bosons . in this case",
    ", we must consider _ the union _ of gauge bosons of the @xmath38 type gauge bosons of the untwisted sector and @xmath39 type gauge bosons in twisted sectors without fixed points .",
    "the @xmath39 type gauge boson is in the fixed point in the first and second tori . for the @xmath39 type gauge bosons of @xmath40 sector to be truly 6d gauge bosons , it should not belong to the fixed points of the first and the third tori .",
    "the case when fixed points are removed appears in the tori where twisting is zero mod integer . for @xmath9 , this happens in @xmath41 twisted sectors with shift vector @xmath42 .",
    "the gauge group of the @xmath43 sector therefore contains the gauge group of the @xmath40 sector .",
    "thus , for the 6d gauge group it is appropriate to take the common intersection of the gauge groups of @xmath44 sectors of 4d , which is simply the gauge group of @xmath40 .",
    "then , the shift vector @xmath45 with @xmath9 shift @xmath46 gives a @xmath29 orbifold model in 6d since the second torus is the fixed torus .",
    "the teardrop fixed points of ( 12 ) and ( 56 ) tori are the fixed points of the @xmath29 orbifold , and the @xmath39 type fields become the untwisted sector fields of the @xmath29 orbifold and become 6d gauge bosons .",
    "this kind of analysis is the strategy we take when the second torus is enlarged .",
    "a similar method can be used in other nonprime orbifolds , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "even though @xmath9 looks complicated , in fact it is the simplest in discussing fixed torus since the fixed torus is obtained just by removing @xmath23 . in stating @xmath49simplest  , we consider the number of wilson line conditions and the number of fixed points being simplest .",
    "it is known that @xmath23 is simpler than @xmath50 in string compactification .",
    "in this section , we obtain the 6d massless spectrum by considering orbifold compactification of 4d internal space , following the method given in @xcite .",
    "let us take the following forms of the shift vector and wilson lines  @xcite @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , toward a 6d model we study the @xmath29 twist given in eq .",
    "( [ z4shift ] ) @xmath53 we split the shift eq .",

    "these are @xmath59 thus , the 6d gauge group is @xmath60    .6d untwisted matter states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the model in ref .",

    "for simplicity and reality , let us assume that su(4 ) is broken to su(2)@xmath61 through the couplings of the sm singlets , which achieve vevs of the string scale at the fixed points .",
    "such localized masses would shift up the kk masses of the coset @xmath62 gauge sector by the amount of order of the compactification scale @xmath1 @xcite . for lower lying kk masses",
    ", this mechanism works more effectively .",
    "it is because in the limit @xmath16 , the effect by the fixed points should disappear and the 6d result be restored . hence such localized masses do not affect @xmath63 in eq .",
