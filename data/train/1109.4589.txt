    "taken at face value , the bbn a(li ) is higher  by at least a factor of 2  than a(li ) measured in _",

    "on the other hand , detailed stellar evolution calculations need to include additional transport mechanisms that follow from first principles . in low mass stars , atomic diffusion  i.e. the slow transport of chemicals due to temperature , pressure and abundance gradients  is the main process that needs to be included , for taking diffusion into account , the agreement between solar models and constraints from helioseismology is greatly improved ( see , i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    ". a general prediction of models including atomic diffusion is that population ii ms stars in the _ spite plateau _",
    "region , with their shallow convective envelopes , are efficiently depleted of li and metals over the ms lifetime ( see , e.g. , the seminal paper by * ? ? ?",

    "include a specific parametrization of turbulent mixing , treated as a diffusive process , with a free parameter that fixes the values of the turbulent diffusion coefficient . a suitable calibration of this parameter  that enables also the transport of additional lithium down to burning temperatures  produces a flat li abundance along the plateau , with a(li ) depleted by about 0.4  dex with respect to the initial value ( see fig .   8 in * ?",
    "this depletion , when applied to the range of a(li ) measured by different authors , can potentially bring into agreement the _ spite plateau _ with bbn predictions .",

    ", with a depletion of 0.2  dex compared to the initial value . given the range of measured a(li ) , the agreement with the bbn lithium abundance is still marginal at best .",
    "similar estimates of primordial li based on spectroscopy of ms stars in globular clusters are complicated by the fact that in many cases the observed a(li ) display spreads related to the presence of second generation stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the metal poor cluster ngc6397 is one object with apparently an essentially homogeneous initial li abundance and @xcite spectroscopic measurements plus the models by @xcite with a suitably calibrated efficiency of their turbulent mixing parametrization  that turns out to be different from the case of field halo dwarfs  are able to reproduce the observed a(li ) ( and [ fe / h ] ) measurements at the ms turn off and the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , for an initial a(li)=2.54 .",
    "the models fail however to match the observed post dredge - up a(li ) on the lower rgb , before the rgb bump .",

    "it appears that , in order to reproduce the li abundances from the turn off to the lower rgb and satisfy at the same time the bbn constraint , for this cluster the turbulence has to reach deeper regions compared to ngc6397 , region hot enough for some additional li burning to occur .",
    "the trend of lithium abundance with effective temperature along the sub - giant branch , found in m4 by @xcite is similar to that found by @xcite in ngc6397 .",
    "this brief summary of previous investigations shows how problematic , from a theoretical point of view , it is to determine the primordial li abundance of _ spite plateau _ stars . in this paper",
    "we investigate a complementary avenue to estimate the halo primordial a(li ) .",
    "we employ spectroscopy of halo stars evolving along the lower rgb , defined  following @xcite  as the portion of the rgb brighter than the luminosity corresponding to the completion of the first dredge - up and fainter than the rgb - bump .",
    "we will show that the effect of atomic diffusion on the surface li abundances of these objects is much smaller than for _ spite plateau _ stars . as a consequence , the observed a(li )",
    "can be employed to set independent , very strong constraints on any additional physical process ( i.e. , turbulent mixing , preprocessing of halo material , modifications to the bbn ) eventually needed to reconcile these values with bbn predictions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  2 analyzes the theoretical advantages of employing a(li ) measured in the atmosphere of lower rgb halo stars to estimate their primordial li abundance , while sect .",
    "3 discusses our selected sample of lower rgb halo objects and the derivation of a(li ) and [ fe / h ] .",
    "section  4 presents theoretical predictions for the surface li abundance in population ii lower rgb stars  from models including atomic diffusion and convection as element transport mechanisms  and the derivation of the initial li for our selected star sample , that provides an estimate of the halo primordial li abundance independent of the _ spite plateau_. section 5 discusses the li abundance in the lower rgb of the galactic globulars ngc  6397 , ngc  6752 and m4 .",
    "a summary and conclusions close the paper .",
    "the surface li abundance after the first dredge - up is essentially a consequence of the dilution due to the increased size of the convective envelope after the ms turn off ( plus a minor contribution from li burning in the deep layers of the fully mixed envelope in the most metal rich halo stars ) . at the end of the ms phase ,",
    "when the deepening convective boundary reaches layers where the li - burning ( @xmath62.5 @xmath7  k ) was efficient during the ms , the surface a(li ) begins to decrease .",
    "this depletion essentially ends when the convective envelope attains its maximum depth and the first dredge - up is complete .",
    "an important point to notice is that atomic diffusion during the ms produces a local maximum of the li abundance in the radiative layers right below the convective envelope ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for only a relatively small fraction of the envelope li is transported deep enough to reach layers where it is eventually burned . as a consequence , models without and with diffusion  fully efficient or even moderated by levitation or some turbulence that just mixes back material diffused from the envelope ",
    "dilute similar amount of li within the deepening convective region .",
    "in addition , the maximum size of the convective envelope is also weakly affected by diffusion  this can be also inferred by the fact that the predicted rgb bump luminosities with and without diffusion are very similar @xcite  and the resulting a(li ) abundances on the lower rgb are only slightly changed .",
    "this is in contrast with models for upper ms stars , where the effect of diffusion on the surface abundances can reach several tenths of dex ( see for example fig .  3 in * ?",
    "theoretical models also predict that along the rgb , after the completion of the dredge - up , atomic diffusion and levitation are not able to modify appreciably the surface abundance of li and all other elements @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundance measurements in giant stars by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , suggest that any additional element transport along the rgb is very likely inefficient in this phase .",
    "on the other hand , stars evolved beyond the rgb bump display the effect of an additional mixing event , for which the so - called thermohaline mixing is nowadays the most popular candidate ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these considerations lead to the conclusion that in general there is a simpler relationship between initial and current surface li abundances in lower rgb stars compared to _",
    "spite plateau _ objects .",
    "the basic reason is that , for a fixed initial li abundance , lower rgb surface abundances are sensitive to the total amount of li left in the star .",
    "in fact , after the effect of dilution is accounted for , they are affected only by the total amount of li burned during the ms phase due to atomic diffusion plus possible additional element transport mechanisms  if they are invoked to solve the discrepancy with bbn results . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed abundances along the _ spite plateau _ are determined by the evolution of the rate of li depletion from the convective envelope due just to diffusion or moderated / enhanced by additional turbulent processes . combining the information obtained from li in lower rgb stars with _ spite plateau _ data , sets much stronger constraints on how these proposed additional mixing processes act between the base of the convective envelope and the deeper li burning regions .    in this study",
    ", we address the issue of the halo primordial li abundance by coupling predictions from standard rgb stellar models to the li abundances measured on a sample of lower rgb population ii field stars . as discussed before",
    ", this will provide an independent quantitative estimate of the difference ( if any ) with the big bang value , and set a very robust constraint on the efficiency of additional physical processes invoked to resolve this discrepancy , complementary to the interpretation of the abundances along the _ spite plateau_. if the solution of the discrepancy involves pre - processing during the galaxy formation or modifications to the bbn ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our analysis will provide a solid quantitative estimate of , respectively , the net amount of li burned during the early galaxy evolution , or exactly how much li must be synthesized in the revised bbn .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "analyses of the li abundances measured along the rgb have been so far mainly aimed at testing the agreement between observed and predicted li depletion after the first dredge - up , assuming a value for the initial a(li ) , often equal to what measured along the plateau @xcite .",
    "this section presents the observational data employed in our study , and the abundance analysis .",
    "particular care is paid to the issue of the effective temperature scale and its influence on the derived values of a(li ) .",
    "we have selected a sample of 17 metal - poor stars ( with [ fe / h]@xmath81 dex ) , located in the part of the rgb fainter than the rgb bump magnitude level .",
    "the selection of this sample was done by cross checking data by @xcite , the simbad website , previous works on chemical abundances in metal - poor giant stars @xcite and the eso and elodie archives , in order to select suitable high - resolution spectra , covering the li line at 6708 @xmath9 .",
    "spectra of 11 stars were retrieved from the eso archive and observed with uves @xcite , employing simultaneously different gratings .",

    "the linelist for the li transitions is from @xcite .",
    "corrections for departures from lte are from @xcite .",
    "the total error in the a(li ) abundance is computed by taking into account the two main source of uncertainty : ( i )  the error in the adopted @xmath2 , typically @xmath110.09 - 0.10 dex per 100 k for a giant star ( giant stars are slightly more sensitive to @xmath2 with respect to the dwarf stars , that are sensitive at a level of @xmath110.06 - 0.07 dex per 100 k ) ; ( ii )  the error in the fitting procedure , obtained by employing montecarlo simulations : for each star , we injected poisson noise into the best - fit synthetic spectrum ( in order to reproduce the observed snr around the li line ) and we repeated the analysis for 1000 montecarlo events .",
    "we estimated a 1@xmath12 level from the resulting abundance distributions ; due to the high snr of the analyzed spectra ( @xmath13100 ) , the typical errors are lower than 0.03 dex .",

    "overall , our analysis reveals that the predicted li depletion @xmath22(li ) along the lower rgb is robust in terms of theoretical interpretation .",
    "the values of @xmath1 inferred from our sample of lower rgb halo field stars range from 2.28 ( obtained with the a99 scale and without the inclusion of atomic diffusion ) to 2.46 ( when the g09 @xmath2 scale is used , together with models including atomic diffusion ) .",
    "inclusion of overshooting from the rgb convective boundary would increase both limits by only 0.01  dex , while variations of age , initial he abundance and mixing length parameter provide changes of a few hundredths of dex or less in terms of @xmath22(li ) .",
    "when a @xmath2 scale is adopted , the effect of fully efficient atomic diffusion on the @xmath1 estimate is by at most 0.07  dex .",
    "the discrepancy with @xmath1 predicted by bbn calculations thus remains , reconfirmed by the robustness of our estimate .",
    "the analysis performed on the lower rgb stars in three galactic globular clusters confirms similar values for @xmath1 , although in general the possible occurrence of self - enrichment processes in these objects has to be considered .",
    "there are several discussions in the literature about how to solve this discrepancy with bbn results .",
    "ideas involve a first generation of stars that has processed and efficiently depleted lithium in a substantial fraction of the early halo baryonic matter @xcite , modifications to the bbn considering the decay of unstable particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , modifications to the reaction cross sections for the li production during bbn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or deep turbulent mixing during the ms that connects the convective envelope to inner , li - depleted regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our result for rgb stars provides an additional robust constraint on the efficiency of this turbulent mixing .",
    "independently of its parametrization , during the ms any additional element transport needs to bring into the li burning region an amount of initial lithium @xmath32(li)=0.3 - 0.4  dex , in order to eliminate the discrepancy with bbn calculations ( the turbulence model denoted as t6.25 or t6.28 by @xcite appear to burn approximately the right amount of li in models with [ fe / h]=  -2.31 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath32(li ) appears to be roughly the same for both halo field and globular cluster stars .",
    "the use of lower rgb stars will allow estimates of the li content in stellar populations more distant that those usually observed to investigate the _",
    "spite plateau_. the obvious benefits are : ( i )   an enlarged sample of field stars and clusters to study the primordial li abundance within the galaxy , and ( ii )   a better chance to assess whether a `` cosmological lithium problem '' exists also in extragalactic systems with a different origin and a different star formation history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a first study of the initial li in @xmath33 cen , widely considered as the remnant of a dwarf galaxy accreted by the milky way ) .",
    "for instance , the current generation of high resolution spectrographs mounted on 8 metre - class telescopes allows to reach down to one magnitude fainter than the rgb bump level for stars in m  54 and the old stellar population of sagittarius dwarf galaxy . in principle , also stars at the rgb bump level in old clusters belonging to the large magellanic cloud can be reached , by using , for example , the vlt spectrograph x - shooter ; this possibility ( even if expensive in terms of observing time due to the faintness of the targets ) will open a new perspective in the investigation of the li problem .",
    "finally , with the advent of 30 metre - class telescopes ( as the e - elt ) spectroscopy of lower rgb stars will provide new constraints to the primordial li abundance in even more distant systems .",
