    "in recent years , nanometer - scale structures have opened up numerous new horizons in both fundamental and applied research @xcite . among the various forms of nanoscale structures , nanowires ( nws )",
    "provide the unique advantages for facilitating four - probe electrical - transport measurements over a wide range of temperature @xmath1 and in externally applied magnetic fields @xmath11 .",
    "in - depth investigations of the rich phenomena and the underlying physics of intrinsic charge and spin conduction processes in single nws are thus feasible .",
    "indeed , to date , significant advances have been made in studies of metallic @xcite , magnetic @xcite , semiconducting @xcite , and superconducting @xcite nws .",
    "zinc oxide ( zno ) nws are probably the most extensively studied materials among all kinds of semiconductor nws , due to their intricate physical properties as well as their widespread potential applications in nanoelectronic and spintronic devices @xcite . in addition to the initial investigations of natively ( unintentionally ) doped samples ,",
    "artificially doped zno nws have attracted much attention .",
    "for instance , the n - type doping of ga and in , among other metal atoms , into zno nws has recently been explored @xcite .",
    "the electrical - transport properties of individual in - doped zno ( hereafter , referred to as izo ) nw @xcite and nw transistors @xcite have also been reported . despite the intense experimental studies in the past years",
    ", the electrical conduction mechanisms in the parent zno nws have only been explained recently .",
    "_ @xcite and tsai _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that most artificially synthesized zno nws , being essentially independent of the growth method , are moderately highly doped and weakly self - compensated , resulting in a splitting of the impurity band . as a result ,",
    "the overall charge transport behavior is due to the  split - impurity - band conduction \" processes .",
    "furthermore , chiu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and tsai _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that many natively doped zno nws , which inherently possess high carrier ( electron ) concentrations , often lie on the insulating side of , but very close to , the metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition .",
    "therefore , it is expected that incorporation of a few atomic percent of , e.g. , the group - iii indium atoms into zno nws may promote the nws to fall on the metallic side of the m - i transition . ( the group - iii atoms , al , ga , and in , are shallow donors in zno @xcite . )",
    "thus , the izo nws should reveal electrical conduction properties characteristic to those of disordered conductors .",
    "in particular , the quantum - interference weak - localization ( wl ) and the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) effects should be manifest at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "apart from the interesting low - dimensional electrical - transport properties that could be expected for nw structures , zno nws inherit some complexities , as compared with other nw materials .",
    "in particular , the question of whether the surfaces of a zno nw are more conducting or less conducting than the bulk has been investigated by several groups .",
    "it is now accepted that surface electron accumulation layers , band bending effects , compositional nonstoichiometries , and ambient conditions , etc .",
    ", can all markedly affect the electrical properties of a surface @xcite . recent measurements of resistance @xmath2 and magnetoresistance ( mr ) by chiu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , hu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and tsai _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have revealed that surface conduction is particularly important in those zno nws lying close to the m - i transition . in this context",
    ", it would be very interesting to investigate if surface conduction could also be pronounced in izo nws which are even more metallic than the natively doped zno nws .",
    "indeed , in this work , we have measured and analyzed the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 as well as the @xmath11 dependence of both perpendicular mr and parallel mr in two izo nws over a wide @xmath1 interval of 170 k. we found a few dimensionality crossovers in the wl and the eei effects as @xmath1 gradually increases from 1 to 70 k. these results strongly point to dominating roles of the _ surface - related conduction _ processes , prompting us to propose a  core - shell - like structure \" in individual izo nws .",
    "this present work demonstrates the complex and rich nature of charge transport processes in zno - based nws .",
    "this work also illustrates that quantum - interference transport studies can provide a useful probe for the electron scattering processes in these nanoscale materials .",
    "furthermore , regarding to the materials and technological aspects , we would like to stress that the nature of impurity doping semiconductor nanostructures is _ intrinsically distinct _ from doping the bulks .",
    "the recent theoretical calculations of dalpian and chelikowsky @xcite have shown that _ dopants would be energetically in favor of segregating to the surfaces rather than distributing uniformly across the radial direction_. their theory provides a strong microscopic support for our experimental observation of a core - shell - like structure in the izo nws .     is responsible for the wl and the eei transport .",

    "the experimental conditions for the 1d , 2d , and 3d wl and eei effects are summarized on the right .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    for the convenience of discussion , we first present our model of the core - shell - like structure and summarize the main results of this work . figure [ fig1 ] shows a schematic of the core - shell - like structure with a surface conduction layer of a thickness @xmath4 ( @xmath5 15 - 17 nm in our izo nws ) .",
    "the sizes of the effective nw diameter @xmath7 and the thickness @xmath4 , relative to the electron dephasing length @xmath6 and the thermal diffusion length @xmath9 , determine the observed one - dimensional ( 1d ) , two - dimensional ( 2d ) , or three - dimensional ( 3d ) wl and eei effects , as summarized in figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "in this section , we concentrate on the @xmath3 data due to the eei effect to provide further justification for the existence of a core - shell - like structure in izo nws .",
    "in addition to the wl effect , the many - body eei effect also results in a resistance rise with decreasing @xmath1 in a weakly disordered conductor @xcite . the eei effect induced correction in 2d",

    "@xmath21 is an electron screening factor averaged over the fermi surface , whose value lies approximately between 0 and 1 @xcite .",

    "the characteristic length scale controlling the sample dimensionality in the eei effect is the thermal diffusion length @xmath9 = @xmath24 .",
    "note that the eei effect in different sample dimensionalities results in distinct @xmath1 dependencies of the resistance rise at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the wl effect induced corrections to the residual resistance at low @xmath1 can be readily suppressed by applying a moderately high @xmath11 field @xcite .",

    "[ fig6 ] ]    we start with our discussion on the izo2 nw .",
    "figure [ fig6](c ) shows the resistivity of the izo2 nw as a function of @xmath27 in both @xmath11 = 0 and in a perpendicular @xmath11 = 4 t , as indicated .",
    "clearly , the 4-t data illustrate a robust linear dependence between @xmath28 3 and 40 k. such a @xmath29@xmath27 temperature dependence manifests the 3d eei effect in this wide @xmath1 interval . by comparing with the prediction of equation  ( [ 3dee ] )",
    ", we obtained a value @xmath21 @xmath5 0.42 .",

    "= 0 , the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath30 is somewhat more complicated , because both the wl and the eei effects now contribute to the total resistivity rise . using @xmath14 = 2.2 @xmath31/s ( table [ t2 ] )",
    ", we estimate @xmath9(5 k ) @xmath5 18 nm . this length scale is basically the conduction shell thickness inferred from the wl mr studies ( section 3 ) .",
    "that is , the 3d eei effect on the resistivity rise is expected to persist from intermediately high @xmath1 down to @xmath28 5 k in this particular nw .",
    "this prediction is in good accord with the observation depicted in figure  [ fig6](c ) .",

    "this figure indicates an approximate ln@xmath1 temperature dependence of @xmath33 between @xmath28 3 and @xmath28 40 k. this observation is meaningful .",

    "= @xmath4@xmath37 and substituting the fitted values of @xmath6 and @xmath38 from our mr data analyses described in section 3 into equation  ( [ 2dwl ] ) , we obtain the dashed curve shown in figure  [ fig6](d ) , which is seen to satisfactorily describe the experimental @xmath33 .",
    "this result strongly confirms our scenario of the quantum - interference transport through a surface layer in single izo nws . recall that the 2d wl mr effect in the izo2 nw has been observed in the same @xmath1 interval of 140 k ( subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "below about 3 k , @xmath32 tends to saturate to a constant value , because @xmath15 becomes very weakly dependent on @xmath1 , as shown in figure  [ fig4](b ) .",
    "we turn to the izo1 nw . for simplicity , we shall present and discuss only the @xmath39 data measured in a perpendicular @xmath11 = 4 t. figure [ fig6](a ) shows that the @xmath40 @xmath29@xmath27 law holds between @xmath28 14 and 40 k. by comparing with equation  ( [ 3dee ] ) , we obtained a value of @xmath21 @xmath5 0.61 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the izo2 nw , a change in the @xmath1 dependence to the 2d @xmath37 @xmath41 @xmath29ln@xmath1 law is seen between @xmath28 3.6 and @xmath28 11 k in this nw , see figure  [ fig6](b ) . by writing @xmath37",

    "this value is reasonably in line with that inferred above from the high-@xmath1 3d regime .",
    "thus , a dimensionality crossover with regard to the eei effect does occur in the @xmath28 1114 k temperature window in this particular nw .",
    "in fact , using @xmath14 = 3.6 @xmath31/s ( table [ t2 ] ) , we estimate @xmath9(11 k ) = 16 nm .",
    "this value is very close to the conduction shell thickness @xmath4 @xmath5 15 nm inferred from the wl mr studies discussed in section 3 . in other words , at @xmath1 @xmath43 11 k , @xmath9",

    "these lengths are relatively short , as compared with @xmath7 .",

    "are a subject of elaborate investigations in the past three decades @xcite .",
    "the quasi - elastic ( i.e. , small - energy - transfer ) nyquist electron - electron ( @xmath49-@xmath49 ) relaxation rate , @xmath50 , in low - dimensional disordered conductors is known to dominate @xmath46 in an appreciable @xmath1 interval . in the following analyses , we use the standard expression : @xmath50 = @xmath51 , where @xmath52 = 2/3 and 1 for 1d and 2d samples , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that , as @xmath1 increases , the exponent of temperature @xmath52 in @xmath50 is expected to change as the sample dimensionality changes in our izo nws . the third term , @xmath53 , on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ rate ] ) denotes any additional inelastic scattering mechanism(s ) that might play a role in the dephasing process at sufficiently high @xmath1 .",
    "before comparing our experimental @xmath46 data with equation  ( [ rate ] ) , we first would like to comment on the electron - phonon ( @xmath49-ph ) relaxation process .",
    "in disordered metals , the @xmath49-ph scattering is often significant at a few degrees of kelvin and higher .",
    "one may then safely identify the @xmath53 term in equation  ( [ rate ] ) as the @xmath49-ph scattering rate @xmath54 @xcite , in either the diffusive limit @xcite or the quasi - ballistic limit @xcite , depending on the experimental conditions .",
    "however , the carrier concentrations @xmath55",

    "the corresponding @xmath49-ph coupling constant ( the constant @xmath59 in @xcite ) is found to be proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath49-ph relaxation must be _ negligible _ in this work @xcite . on the contrary",

    "more precisely , they reported @xmath108(1.9 k ) increased from @xmath28 3.0 to @xmath28 5.7 ns as @xmath55 increased from 1.3@xmath56@xmath109 to 7.4@xmath56@xmath109 @xmath58 . although the authors had attributed their inelastic scattering rate to @xmath54 , these results seem to be hardly reconciled with the current understanding of the @xmath49-ph relaxation process in degenerate semiconductors .",

    "it is puzzling why the @xmath49-@xmath49 scattering with large - energy transfer and other inelastic electron scattering processes did not play any role even up to such a high @xmath1 of 150 k. it is also not clear if any dimensionality crossover in the wl effect had taken place in the sample .",

    "<S> in addition to the @xmath1 dependence of resistance @xmath2 , we have measured the magnetoresistances ( mr ) in magnetic fields applied either perpendicular or parallel to the nw axis . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath3 and mr data in different @xmath1 intervals are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the one- ( 1d ) , two- ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) weak - localization ( wl ) and the electron - electron interaction ( eei ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a few dimensionality crossovers in the two effects are observed . </S>",
    "<S> these crossover phenomena are consistent with the model of a  core - shell - like structure \" in individual izo nws , where an outer shell of a thickness @xmath4 ( @xmath5 1517 nm ) is responsible for the quantum - interference transport . in the wl effect , as the electron dephasing length @xmath6 gradually decreases with increasing @xmath1 from the lowest measurement temperatures , a 1d - to-2d dimensionality crossover takes place around a characteristic temperature where @xmath6 approximately equals @xmath7 , an effective nw diameter which is slightly smaller than the geometric diameter . as @xmath1 further increases , a 2d - to-3d dimensionality crossover occurs around another characteristic temperature where @xmath6 approximately equals @xmath4 ( @xmath8 ) . in the eei effect , a 2d - to-3d dimensionality crossover takes place when the thermal diffusion length @xmath9 progressively decreases with increasing @xmath1 and approaches @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a crossover to the 1d eei effect is not seen because @xmath10 even at @xmath1 = 1 k in our izo nws . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we explain the various inelastic electron scattering processes which govern @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates the complex and rich nature of the charge conduction properties of group - iii metal doped zno nws . </S>",
    "<S> this work also strongly indicates that the surface - related conduction processes are essential to doped semiconductor nanostructures . </S>"
