    "the importance of vortex reconnections in turbulence  @xcite can not be understated .",
    "reconnections randomize the velocity field , play a role in the energy cascade , contribute to the fine - scale mixing , enhancing diffusion  @xcite , and are the dominant mechanism of jet noise generation .",
    "if the axes of tubular vortex structures are interpreted as the skeleton of turbulence , then the knottedness of the axes characterizes the turbulence s topology , and vortex reconnections are the critical events which change this topology  @xcite .",
    "this idealized picture becomes physical reality if one moves from ordinary viscous fluids to quantum fluids  @xcite such as superfluid liquid helium ( @xmath0he - b and @xmath1he ) and atomic bose - einstein condensates . in these superfluid systems ,",
    "quantum mechanics constrains any rotational motion to vortex lines around which the circulation is fixed by the condition    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the velocity , @xmath4 is a closed integration path around the vortex axis , @xmath5 is planck s constant , @xmath6 is the mass of the relevant boson ( a helium atom in the case of @xmath1he , a cooper pair in the case of @xmath0he - b ) , and @xmath7 is the quantum of circulation .",
    "another constraint of quantum mechanics is the small vortex core , which has fixed radius ( @xmath8 in @xmath1he , @xmath9 in @xmath0he - b ) and is orders of magnitude smaller than the average distance between vortices in typical experiments ; because of these constraints , no intensification or diminution of vorticity through stretching of the vortex core is possible in quantum fluids .",
    "vortex reconnections of individual quantum vortex lines are discrete , dramatic events , which have been recently visualized in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "they are the key to understanding quantum turbulence  @xcite , a disordered state of vortex lines which is easily created by stirring liquid helium and atomic condensates . compared to quantum reconnections , viscous reconnections in ordinary ( classical ) fluids are not complete events :",
    "classical vorticity is continuous , not discrete , and parts of the initial vortical tubes can be left behind as vortex threads , which then undergo successive reconnections ( the cascade and mixing scenarios ) , as newly formed vortex bridges recoil from each other by self - advection  @xcite .",
    "another important difference is that classical reconnections are dissipative events : viscous forces turn part of the fluid s energy into heat , whereas in a superfluid the viscosity is zero , and the fluid s total energy is conserved .",
    "it can be argued that , because of the utter simplicity of quantum vortices ( zero viscosity , fixed circulation , small core size ) , quantum vortex reconnections are not only important phenomena of low temperature physics and of atomic physics , but are also relevant to our general understanding of fluid phenomena as toy models of euler dynamics .",
    "although a rather large number of studies addressed the viscous reconnection problem , both the underlying mechanism and various scaling relationships have remained elusive  @xcite .",
    "the first analytical work on classical vortex reconnections goes back to crow  @xcite , who studied the instability of a pair of counter - rotating vortex tubes shed from the wing tips of an airplane .",
    "however , the systematic study of vortex reconnections began with observations and laboratory experiments of the simplest and most fundamental interaction of two colliding vortex rings  @xcite . with the rapid development of supercomputers , direct numerical study of vortex reconnection became possible .",
    "ashurst & meiron  @xcite numerically solved the incompressible navier - stokes equations in the region of closest approach of two vortex rings by providing an initial condition generated using the biot - savart ( bs ) model  @xcite of vortex filaments . at the same time , pumir & kerr  @xcite performed numerical simulations of interacting vortex tubes .",
    "many other studies followed ( for a review of the extensive work up to 1994 see the review of kida & takaoka  @xcite ) , but the literature on classical vortex reconnections seemed to fade after  1994  @xcite .",
    "the recent work by hussain & duraisamy  @xcite renewed the interest in the mechanics of viscous vortex reconnection .",
    "their study focused on the direct , high resolution numerical simulation of the incompressible navier - stokes equations over a wide range of vortex reynolds numbers , @xmath10 , for two perturbed anti - parallel vortex tubes .",
    "they found that the minimum distance @xmath11 between the vortex tube centroids scales as @xmath12 _ before _ the reconnection and as @xmath13 _ after _ the reconnection , where @xmath14 is time and @xmath15 is the instant of smallest separation between the vortex centroids .",
    "the literature concerned with quantum reconnections is more limited .",
    "the possibility of reconnections was first raised by feynman  @xcite in his pioneering work on the applications of quantum mechanics to superfluid helium .",
    "schwarz  @xcite realized that vortex reconnections are necessary to account for quantum turbulence .",
    "he modelled quantum vortices as classical vortex filaments and proposed the local induction approximation ( lia  @xcite ) as a practical alternative to the exact ( but cpu - intensive ) biot - savart law for the numerical study of superfluid vortex dynamics .",
    "a few years later , koplik & levine  @xcite performed the first numerical simulation of quantum vortex reconnections by solving the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) which governs the motion of a bose - einstein condensate and is used as a model of superfluid helium .",
    "they found that if two vortices are nearly anti - parallel when the large - scale fluid motion brings them together , they reconnect , thus confirming the conjecture of feynman and schwarz .    soon after , using the vortex filament model of schwarz , de  waele & aarts  @xcite numerically integrated the biot - savart equation for the ideal - fluid velocity field and claimed the existence of a universal route to reconnection for all kind of initial vortex - antivortex arrangements : their calculations showed that , when vortices approach each other , they always form the same pyramidal cusp .",
    "they measured the minimum distance between vortices , @xmath11 , during the approach to reconnection as a function of time @xmath14 , and found that @xmath16    where @xmath15 is the time of reconnection .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : aarts ] ) is consistent with the dimensional argument that , if the only relevant parameter in reconnection dynamics is the quantum of circulation , then @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "leadbeater _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the gpe model to study reconnections of vortex rings launched against each other , and discovered that a sound wave ( in the form of a short rarefaction pulse ) is emitted at a reconnection event .",
    "the wave turns part of the initial kinetic energy of the vortices into acoustic energy which is radiated away .",
    "acoustic energy is also created by vortex acceleration @xcite .",
    "the effects are clearly important to make sense of the observed decay of quantum turbulence at very low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "individual quantum vortex reconnections were first observed by paoletti  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite by analyzing the trajectories of solid hydrogen tracers in superfluid @xmath1he .",
    "they verified that the scaling  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) with @xmath18 holds before and after the reconnections , that is to say quantum reconnections are statistically time reversible , unlike classical reconnections  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the expression @xmath20    is the best fit to their data , with wide distribution of values centred around @xmath21 ( larger than @xmath22 found by de  waele & aarts@xcite ) and @xmath23 .",
    "the universality of the route to reconnections was questioned by tebbs  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who performed a series of numerical simulations of quantum reconnections using the gpe .",
    "they reproduced the pyramidal shape of the vortex lines observed by de  waele & aarts  @xcite for the initial configuration used by these authors , but did not observe the same shape for other configurations .",
    "they also confirmed the scaling  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , again in agreement with de  waele & aarts  @xcite , but did not measure the time evolution of @xmath11 after the reconnection .",
    "kursa  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite employed lia , biot - savart and gpe simulations , and showed that a single reconnection of two almost anti - parallel quantum vortices can lead to the creation of a cascade of vortex rings , provided that the angle between the vortices is sufficiently small .",
    "kerr  @xcite , by means of numerical simulation of the gpe , investigated the reconnection between a pair of perturbed anti - parallel quantum vortices .",
    "he argued that kinetic energy is converted into interaction energy and eventually local kinetic energy depletion that is similar to energy decay in a classical fluid , even though the governing equations are hamiltonian and energy conserving .",
    "the present study aims at characterizing vortex reconnection in quantum fluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the three - dimensional gpe in different vortex configurations .",
    "our goal is to extract the minimum distance @xmath11 between vortices as a function of time , both before and after the reconnection , compare results against classical reconnections , quantum reconnections computed with the biot - savart law , and experiments in superfluid helium .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the governing gpe , cast it in dimensionless form , and present the straight vortex solution . in section  [ sec : results ] we describe the initial condition of our numerical calculations in terms of the initial angle @xmath24 between the vortex lines , and present computed vortex reconnections , paying attention to the minimum distance @xmath11 between vortices before and after the reconnection , and the sound wave which is generated .",
    "we also perform reconnections using the biot - savart model . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we compare gpe reconnections and biot - savart reconnections with previous work and experiments , and draw the conclusions . the numerical method which we use to solve the gpe",
    "is described in the appendix .",
    "the governing equation for a weakly - interacting bose - einstein condensate is the gpe @xcite    @xmath25    where @xmath26 the macroscopic single - particle wave function for @xmath27 bosons of mass @xmath6 at position @xmath28 and time @xmath14 , @xmath29 is the strength of the repulsive interaction between the bosons , @xmath30 is the chemical potential ( the energy increase upon adding a boson ) , @xmath31 , and the normalization condition is    @xmath32    to study atomic condensates rather than liquid helium , a term of the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a suitable trapping potential ( usually harmonic ) , is added to the right hand side of equation [ eq : dimnlse ] .",
    "hereafter we shall not consider such term , but limit our work to homogeneous condensates .",
    "when applying the gpe to superfluid helium we must remember that helium is a liquid , not a weakly interacting gas , so the gpe model is more qualitative than quantitative .",
    "for example , the dispersion relation of small perturbations from the uniform solution @xmath35 of equation  [ eq : dimnlse ] is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the angular velocity , @xmath38 is the wavenumber and @xmath39 is the speed of sound .",
    "note that for @xmath40 we have @xmath41 ( phonons ) , and for @xmath42 we have @xmath43 ( free particles ) , without the roton minimum which is characteristic of superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "another shortcoming of the gpe is the vortex core : more sophisticated models of the helium vortex core exist @xcite , but are not practical for the study of complex dynamics such as vortex reconnections .    by applying the transformation    @xmath44    where @xmath35 is the uniform solution at rest in an infinite domain",
    ", we cast the gpe in the following dimensionless form    @xmath45    the quantity @xmath46 is called the healing length or coherence length .",
    "it is the typical length scale over which the wave function bends , and therefore determines the vortex core radius ( see next section ) and the thickness of any superfluid boundary layer in the presence of a wall .",
    "the numerical method to numericaly solve the gpe is described in the appendix .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ]  ( left ) shows that during the time evolution the hamiltonian energy , defined by @xmath47 is sufficiently well conserved : the numerical error is less than one part in @xmath48 .",
    "the fluid dynamics interpretation of the gpe arises from the madelung transformation    @xmath49    which yields the following equations    @xmath50    @xmath51    ( written in tensorial notation ) , where density and velocity are    @xmath52    and    @xmath53    are the pressure and the so - called quantum stress .",
    "it is easy to verify that the quantum stress term at the right hand side of in equation ( [ eq : gpeinnsmom ] ) is negligible compared to the pressure term at length scales larger than unity ( the coherence length ) .",
    "since , as we shall see , the vortex core radius is of the order of the coherence length , we conclude that , at scales larger than the vortex core , the gpe , expressed by equations ( [ eq : gpeinnscont ] ) and ( [ eq : gpeinnsmom ] ) , reduces to the classical ( compressible ) euler equations .",
    "incompressible euler dynamics is achieved in the further limit of small velocity ( compared to the sound speed @xmath39 ) at constant density ( again , away from the vortex cores ) .",
    "we seek a two - dimensional solution of equation   that represents a straight vortex centred at the origin .",
    "it is well - known that the classical two - dimensional euler vortex of circulation @xmath54 has azimuthal velocity @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radius and @xmath57 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the cartesian components of the velocity are thus @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ". therefore @xmath60 .",
    "this shows that the velocity field is solenoidal ( @xmath61 ) , that the quantum mechanical phase , @xmath62 , is simply the azimuthal angle @xmath63 , and that the quantum of circulation , in our dimensionless units , is equal to @xmath64 . in steady conditions",
    ", the continuity equation ensures that @xmath65 , hence @xmath66 , which means that @xmath67 .",
    "the solution @xmath68 has infinite energy and must be rejected .",
    "the other possibility is that @xmath69 . since the cylindrical coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath63 are perpendicular to each other",
    ", @xmath71 is parallel to @xmath70 , hence @xmath72 is perpendicular to @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , for a steady two - dimensional and divergence - free velocity field , we must have @xmath73 .",
    "seeking a solution which represents a vortex centred at the origin , we set @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a function to be determined . by imposing",
    "that @xmath76 is the steady solution of equation  , we find that @xmath75 satisfies the equation    @xmath77    with boundary conditions @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the equation can be integrated numerically , but , to make the computation of the initial condition faster , we look for a pad approximation @xmath80 to @xmath75 of the form @xmath81    which agrees with @xmath75 at the origin to the highest possible order , i.e. @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . in our case @xmath87 , and the pad approximation can be limited to  @xcite    @xmath88    with @xmath89    the quantum vortex core is thus a hole of radius of the order of @xmath90 around which the quantum mechanical phase changes by @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ]  ( right ) compares the radial profile of the density near the vortex axis computed numerically and with the pad approximation .",
    "our initial condition consists of two straight vortex lines @xmath91 and @xmath92 as in figure  [ fig:2 ] ( the arrow denotes the direction of the vorticity ) , which intersect the @xmath93-axis respectively at the points @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we call @xmath96 the @xmath93-@xmath97 plane , @xmath98 the plane perpendicular to @xmath96 and passing through @xmath95 , and @xmath99 the intersection between @xmath96 and @xmath98 .",
    "we call @xmath24 the angle formed by the directions @xmath100 and @xmath92 , where @xmath100 is the projection of @xmath91 onto @xmath98 .",
    "in the case of two parallel vortices we have @xmath101 ; in the case of two anti - parallel vortices we have @xmath102 .",
    "perpendicular intersections occur for @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( the latter is show at the right of figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "our first numerical experiment is concerned with the reconnection of anti - parallel vortex lines ( reconnecting angle @xmath102 ) .",
    "the size of the computational box is @xmath105 . at time",
    "@xmath106 the vortex lines are located at position @xmath107 . in order to make sure that the reconnection occurs in the centre of the computational domain",
    ", we impose a slight initial perturbation to the vortex lines , of the form @xmath108 ^ 6 $ ] .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:3 ] ) shows some snapshots of the time - evolution .",
    "it is apparent that the two vortices move as a pair in the @xmath109-direction .",
    "the slight initial curvature enhances the crow instability and the vortices approach each other .",
    "the reconnection results in the formation of two u - shaped vortex lines , which bend and move apart from each other .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:4 ] ) shows the minimum distance @xmath11 between reconnecting vortices as a function of time @xmath14 . the algorithm to compute @xmath11 searches for vortex lines , starting from the boundaries , following the minimum of the density @xmath110 .",
    "once the vortex lines are retrieved , they are put in parametric form as curves in @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 , and @xmath11 is computed .",
    "our main finding is that @xmath113 behaves differently before and after the reconnection . in this",
    "respect , quantum vortex reconnections are therefore similar to viscous reconnections .",
    "indeed figure  ( [ fig:3 ] ) resembles very closely figure  ( 3b ) of hussain & duraisamy  @xcite .",
    "we perform several other numerical calculations of vortex reconnections to check whether the time dependence of @xmath113 depends on the angle @xmath24 of the initial condition .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:5 ] ) shows the time evolution of two initially straight vortices set at the angle @xmath114 .",
    "again , we observe that the vortices first approach each other , then move away after the reconnection .",
    "a very similar behavior characterize vortices initially set at @xmath103 ( orthogonal reconnection ) , whose time - evolution is shown in figure  ( [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:7 ] ) summarizes the results obtained for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the minimum distance between the vortices , @xmath11 , is reported separately before and after reconnection as a function of @xmath115 , where @xmath15 is the time at which the vortex reconnection takes place .",
    "power laws ( black solid lines ) of the form @xmath116    ( where @xmath11 and @xmath117 are dimensionless ) are super - imposed to fit the numerical data ; the fitting coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath118 are reported in table  [ tab:1 ] . from figure  ( [ fig:7 ] ) and",
    "table  ( [ tab:1 ] ) we conclude that gpe reconnections are not time - symmetric : the average values of @xmath118 is @xmath119 before the reconnection and @xmath120 after the reconnection .",
    "if we average all values , before and after , we obtain @xmath121 , which is in fair agreement with @xmath18 predicted by the scaling argument ( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "table  ( [ tab:1 ] ) also shows that the average values of @xmath19 are @xmath122 before the reconnection and @xmath123 after the reconnection .",
    "if we set @xmath18 and return to dimensional variables , we obtain @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are about half of the value @xmath21 found by paoletti _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their experiment . as a check ,",
    "we repeat all numerical simulations for opposite angles ( e.g. @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc . ) obtaining the same temporal dependence of @xmath11 upon time @xmath14 .",
    "our calculation confirms the finding of leadbeater _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , that a vortex reconnection creates a wave .",
    "first we consider the reconnection of anti - parallel vortices ( @xmath103 ) . by extracting the iso - surfaces at quite large level ,",
    "as done in figure  ( [ fig:8 ] ) for @xmath128 , one notices the formation of a mushroom - shaped pressure ( density ) rarefaction wave generated by the reconnection . the wave becomes shallower as it moves away from the vortices .",
    "the bottom plot of figure  ( [ fig:8 ] ) shows the vortex lines together with the pressure wave obtained by replacing the vortex tubes from the isosurface at @xmath128 with the isosurface at @xmath129 .",
    "the footprint of the wave is particularly visible in contours of @xmath110 on the plane @xmath130 , as shown in figure  ( [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "the pressure wave is clearly visible for relatively small angles between vortices , @xmath131 , whereas for larger angles it becomes difficult to clearly track it and visualize it .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:10 ] ) shows the time evolution of the mushroom - shaped pressure wave ejected after reconnection for @xmath132 ( isosurfaces at @xmath133 ) .      as we have mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , secondary generation of vortex rings following a reconnection event was observed in the numerical simulations of kursa et al .",
    "@xcite and kerr @xcite .",
    "kursa et al .",
    "also studied how the emission of vortex rings depends on the initial angle between the vortices ( almost antiparallel configurations favour the generation of vortex rings following the crow instability ) .",
    "we do not investigate further the generation of vortex rings , since it was already studied in detail in cited works .",
    "we only remark that if we make our computational box longer in the @xmath97 direction , vortex rings generation becomes visible , as shown in figure  [ fig:11 ] . as for the physical significance of this effect",
    ", we notice that , according to a recent study of baggaley et al .",
    "@xcite , the distribution of reconnecting angles @xmath24 depends on the nature of the quantum turbulence .",
    "quantum turbulence generated with grids or propellers seems classical in nature ( for example the kinetic energy is distributed on the length scales according to the classical kolmogorov @xmath134 law where @xmath38 is the wavenumber ) , and contains coherent bundles of vortices which induce reconnections at small angles @xmath24 . on the contrary , quantum turbulence generated thermally ( e.g. counterflow turbulence ) is spatially more random , and reconnections tend to be antiparallel ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare reconnections computed with the gpe with reconnections computed with the biot - savart law .",
    "the latter , which is widely used to study quantum turbulence , approximates vortex lines as space curves @xmath136 of infinitesimal thickness which move according to    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is arc length and the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bs ] ) expresses incompressible euler dynamics in integral form  @xcite .",
    "physically , it assumes that the density of the fluid is constant ( zero mach number limit ) and that the vortex core is much smaller than any other length scale in the flow ( a small parameter must be introduced to de - singularise the integral ) .",
    "vortex reconnections are forbidden by euler dynamics , therefore , when applying equation  ( [ eq : bs ] ) to superfluid helium , we must supplement it with an algorithmic reconnection procedure which changes the topology of two vortex filaments when the distance between them is less than a prescribed cutoff value , as first explained by schwarz  @xcite . the numerical techniques which we use to compute biot - savart evolution",
    "are described in our previous papers @xcite . here",
    "it suffices to say that the vortex filaments are discretized into a variable number of points @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , holding their relative distance approximately between @xmath141 and @xmath142 where @xmath141 represents the prescribed numerical resolution .",
    "the reconnection algorithm which we use , which is triggered when the vortex separation is closer than @xmath142 , has been already described in detail  @xcite and compared to other algorithms used in the liquid helium literature .",
    "it must be stressed that , unlike some of our recent work on quantum turbulence @xcite , the results which we present here do not use a tree - algorithm  @xcite to approximate and speed up the calculation of biot - savart integrals .",
    "we perform our calculations in an open domain with numerical resolution @xmath143 . the initial condition of the first numerical calculation which we present consists of two vortex rings of the same polarity and radius @xmath144 set parallel to each other , side - by - side on the @xmath145-plane and travelling in the @xmath93-direction , initially at distance @xmath146 from each other .",
    "the initial number of discretization points for the two rings is @xmath147 .",
    "the same initial condition was used by de waele & aarts  @xcite .",
    "figure  ( [ fig:12 ] ) shows the time evolution .",
    "note that the resulting vortex reconnection is locally anti - parallel ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the initial condition of the second numerical calculation consists of the same two rings , but initially set perpendicular to each other .",
    "the time evolution is shown in figure  ( [ fig:13 ] ) .",
    "note that the resulting reconnection is locally orthogonal ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the minimum distance between vortices , @xmath11 , for both parallel and perpendicular rings , is shown in figure  ( [ fig:14 ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the temporal scaling is time symmetric before and after the reconnection , in agreement with equation  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) with @xmath18 and with the results of de  waele & aarts  @xcite .",
    "the time - symmetry of biot - savart reconnections contrast the time - asymmetry of gpe reconnections showed in the previous sections and of classical reconnections  @xcite .",
    "we tested the dependence of this result on the reconnection algorithm used  @xcite , and found no difference in the scaling .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising as a change of the reconnection algorithm would imply a change of @xmath11 of the order of @xmath150 only , whilst we measure the evolution of @xmath11 up to distances of the order @xmath151 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 however is not the same in all cases ( although , for the approach of parallel rings , it is in fair agreement with de  waele & aarts  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar spread was observed by tsubota & adachi  @xcite .",
    "the speed at which the vortex lines move away from each other after the reconnection is faster than the speed at which they approach each other ; this effect is also visible in figures  ( [ fig:14 ] ) , and qualitatively consistent with the findings obtained with the gpe , see figure  ( [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "hussain & duraisamy  @xcite have shown that , in ordinary incompressible viscous fluids , the minimum separation @xmath11 between reconnecting vortex tubes behaves differently before ( @xmath12 ) and after ( @xmath13 ) the reconnection at @xmath152 . by solving the gpe we find a similar time asymmetry , although with different power laws : @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively , independently of the initial angle between the vortex lines .",
    "on the contrary , by solving the biot - savart equation , we find that the scaling is time symmetric , with @xmath155 for both @xmath156 and @xmath157 .    what causes the difference ?",
    "the main difference between the gpe model and the biot - savart model is that the former is compressible and the latter is not .",
    "clearly the rarefaction wave which is generated at the gpe reconnection breaks the time symmetry , transforming  @xcite some of the kinetic energy of the vortices into acoustic energy which is radiated to infinity ( in analogy with the viscous dissipation of kinetic energy at navier - stokes reconnections ) .",
    "the fact that gpe reconnections do not follow the power law ( [ eq : scaling ] ) predicted by the simple dimensional argument is not surprising : at the very small scales explored by solving the gpe , other parameters besides the quantum of circulation may be relevant in determing @xmath11 , for example the coherence length .    it is also clear that the biot - savart model and the gpe model probe different length scales . as remarked in section  [ sec : model ] , the gpe should converge to incompressible euler behaviour in the limit @xmath158 of small velocity @xmath159 compared to the speed of sound @xmath160 .",
    "the velocity of a vortex strand of local curvature @xmath161 is approximately @xmath162 , hence we expect to recover the biot - savart law for @xmath163 .",
    "however , as noticed earlier , the gpe is only a qualitative model of helium . in estimating @xmath164 we should not use the observed value @xmath165 , but rather the value of @xmath160 which arises from the gpe itself , consistently with the vortex core size resulting from the gpe .",
    "the first step is to identify the coherence length @xmath166 .",
    "experiments with ions and vortex rings by rayfield and reif suggest @xcite that the radius of the vortex core is @xmath167 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ]  ( right ) shows that the density raises from zero to half of its value at infinity at distance @xmath168 ( 1.5 dimensionless units ) from the axis of the vortex .",
    "taking this distance as the ( arbitrary but reasonable ) value of the vortex core radius @xmath90 , we have @xmath169 .",
    "the half - size of our computational box ( 30 coherence length units ) thus corresponds to @xmath170 .",
    "the second step is to find the sound speed in the gpe evolution . from @xmath39 and @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the mass of one helium atom .",
    "we conclude that gpe evolution should become similar to biot - savart evolution for @xmath173 , that is to say for @xmath174 ( radius of curvature much greater than 9 dimensionless units ) .",
    "it is apparent in figures  [ fig:3 ] ,  [ fig:5 ] and  [ fig:6 ] that the radius of curvature of the vortex line(s ) near the reconnecting point , which determines @xmath113 , is still too small to satisfy this condition .",
    "the biot - savart model assumes scales much larger than the vortex core , which is effectively neglected .",
    "so it is not possible , as a matter of principle , to use the biot - savart model to study behaviour at the scale of the coherence length .",
    "neither is possible , for practical computing reasons , to solve the gpe at the large scales explored by biot - savart calculations such as those in section  ( [ sec : results_bs ] ) .",
    "the experimental observations of paoletti _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite agree with the biot - savart results in terms of the time symmetry and the exponent @xmath18 of the power law ( but it must be noticed that , for the gpe model , the average of the exponents before and after the reconnection is the same @xmath175 found in the experiment ) . in the experiment ,",
    "the motion of the vortex lines was detected using solid hydrogen tracer particles of radius @xmath176 , ten thousand times larger than the coherence length in superfluid @xmath1he .",
    "the rarefaction wave generated by gpe reconnections has a wavelength of about ten times the coherence length ; although it is very deep initially , it quickly spreads out and vanishes as it moves away .",
    "on the scale of the tracer particles , the density of the fluid is thus constant , so it is not surprising that the biot - savart model is a better approximation to the observed dynamics of the vortex lines .",
    "finally , the spread of the values of the coefficient @xmath19 which we compute and the similar spread observed in the experiment is likely to arise from differences in the initial condition , geometry of nearby vortex lines and the velocity gradients which they induce , as discussed by paoletti _",

    "without loss of generality , and for sake of simplicity , we describe in detail the numerical method applied to the one - dimensional case of equation   and report at the end of the section the straightforward generalization to the three - dimensional case .",
    "it is convenient to split the gpe evolution in two time steps  @xcite :        thus separating linear and non - linear operators , where the subscript @xmath14 denotes the time derivative .",
    "we assume that the solution is periodic in the domain @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath180 , and seek a numerical solution in the time interval @xmath181 by expanding @xmath76 via fourier transform as      where @xmath183 is the number of modes , @xmath184 are the time - dependent fourier coefficients , and the functions @xmath185 are orthonormal ( i.e. @xmath186 ) . by computing the temporal and spatial derivatives of @xmath76 , substituting them in equation  ( [ eq : splittwo ] ) , multiplying the latter times @xmath187 , integrating between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , and using the orthonormality property of the functions @xmath190 , equation  ( [ eq : splittwo ] ) reads @xmath191                  the second part of the time - splitting scheme preserves mass as well .",
    "this is easy proved by taking the conjugate of equation  ( [ eq : splittwo ] ) ; from @xmath201 we obtain @xmath202 , hence the derivative of @xmath203 with respect to @xmath14 is                after computing the temporal and spatial derivatives of @xmath76 , substituting them in equation  ( [ eq : splittwo ] ) , multiplying the differential equation times @xmath209 , integrating in space , and using the orthonormality property of the functions @xmath190 , the first part of the splitting now becomes              in order to outline the numerical algorithm it is convenient to formulate the partial differential equation   as an ordinary differential equation suppressing the spatial dependence and replacing @xmath213 with @xmath214  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the initial value problem @xmath215 u(t ) , \\quad u(t_0)=u_0,\\ ] ]          since both solutions of the two parts of the splitting are explicit , the only numerical error introduced by the method is confined to the computation of the fourier transform and its inverse . the second order error in time due to the strang splitting can be improved to fourth order without further numerical complications  @xcite .",

    "however , certain geometries ( such as two anti - parallel vortices aligned along the @xmath97-direction , moving along @xmath109 and centered in @xmath234 ) allow us to double the grid points only in the @xmath109-direction due to the symmetry with respect to the @xmath130 and @xmath235 planes .",
