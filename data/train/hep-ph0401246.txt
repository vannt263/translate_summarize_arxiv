    "as one of the simplest processes to investigate both perturbative and nonperturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , charmonium production at various collision processes has stimulated a lot of interesting theoretical and experimental works .",
    "one of such developments in the past few years , called nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite which generalizes and improves the conventional color - singlet model ( csm ) , has provided a successful explanation of the cdf measurements of prompt @xmath0 and @xmath15 production at the tevatron  @xcite . within the framework of nrqcd , the puzzle of @xmath16 productions in excess of the csm prediction can be solved by introducing significant contributions from color - octet terms , which correspond to a gluon forming a @xmath17 pair in a color - octet state at short distances and then evolving at long distances into a color - singlet state along with other light quarks . to confirm the validity of the color - octet mechanism ( com ) , braaten and chen first suggested that the inclusive @xmath16 productions through @xmath1 annihilation may provide an opportunity to observe the color - octet contributions to the cross section and angular distributions  @xcite .",
    "subsequently many detailed calculations have been performed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "recently , babar and belle collaborations have published their experimental data for prompt @xmath0 productions  @xcite .",
    "both measurements for the inclusive processes are dramatically larger than the leading - order prediction of the csm . however , there is no obvious evidence in support of the existence of the color - octet state reported by belle measurement , especially in the upper end - point region of @xmath0 momentum distributions where the significant color - octet signal is predicted by previous analysis .",
    "although higher order corrections may significantly soften the hard @xmath0 momentum spectrum of the com  @xcite , it is the following belle observation [ rate ] ( e^+ e^- j / c |c)/(e^+ e^-",
    "j / x ) = 0.59^+0.15_-0.130.12=0.590.18 , which prompts us to reconsider the normalization of the @xmath18 production in csm .",
    "even higher ratio , [ rate2 ] ( e^+ e^- j / c |c)/(e^+ e^- j / x ) = 0.670.12 , has been reported by belle as a preliminary result based on @xmath19 data set  @xcite .",
    "since it is unlikely that com gives the ratio larger than a quarter , we may conclude that the com contribution is sub - dominant in the process @xmath20 at @xmath21 .    in this report",
    ", we assume that the com contribution is negligible for prompt @xmath0 productions , and study if the csm predictions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be made consistent by introducing the renormalization @xmath6 factors for the total cross sections , and by considering the softening of the @xmath0 momentum spectrum in the @xmath24 process .",
    "we give predictions for the @xmath0 production and decay angular distributions , which will be useful to test our assumptions and to measure the @xmath6 factors and the momentum distributions of individual subprocesses in future precision experiments .",
    "we note here some other evidences that may support our assumption indirectly .",
    "the exclusive cross sections for the double - charmonium productions such as @xmath25 , measured by belle , is also one order of magnitude larger than the leading - order prediction  @xcite . since in the exclusive processes ,",
    "the color - octet contribution is negligible , a large @xmath6 factor for the @xmath26 production amplitude in the csm may be necessary to explain the experimental data , as has been illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "lately some authors have calculated electromagnetic contributions and the relativistic correction  @xcite , and also considered the possibility of mis - detecting the qed process @xmath27 at belle  @xcite . however , since the considered subprocesses have the same order of magnitude of the original tree - level cross section in csm , they are not sufficient to provide an explanation of the large enhancement of the @xmath18 cross section . in the recent report  @xcite , belle collaboration showed that they are capable of distinguishing @xmath0 from @xmath28 and that they observe no evidence of @xmath29 yet .",
    "another evidence of possible suppression of com comes from radiative @xmath30 decays . at the amplitude level",
    ", @xmath31 is quite similar to inclusive @xmath0 productions except for the heavy quark masses . recently",
    ", radiative @xmath30 decays observe by cleo  @xcite has been studied in the framework of the combination of nrqcd and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite .",
    "the result shows that a good fit in the end - point region of the photon energy spectrum is obtained only when the color - octet matrix elements are set to zero .",
    "the same may or may not apply for prompt @xmath0 production in @xmath32 collisions , but we can take into account the collinear suppression effect at the end - point region in @xmath33 process , which is very similar to that of the @xmath34 in the csm .    in section 2 , we give the leading - order calculations of the processes @xmath35 and @xmath33 and correct some mistakes in literatures .",
    "the production of @xmath36 through two virtual photons is also considered and the fractions for transversely and longitudinally polarized @xmath0 are presented . in section 3 , we extract the collinear suppression effect in @xmath37 production from the photon momentum spectrum of @xmath30 radiative decays , and find that the observed @xmath0 momentum spectrum and the @xmath18 fraction eq.([rate2 ] ) can be reproduced by the csm if we introduce a large @xmath6 factor of @xmath7 for the @xmath18 cross section while the @xmath24 process does not need a @xmath6 factor significantly different from unity .",
    "in section 4 , we present various distributions for the inclusive @xmath0 productions in the different momentum regions and study the sensitivity of the @xmath6 factor in terms of several production and decay angular asymmetries . in section 5 , we discuss the connection between the inclusive process and the exclusive double - charmonium production .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section 6 . in appendix",
    "a , we present technical details of the scheme which we developed to calculate the helicity amplitudes of nrqcd processes by using the helas codes  @xcite .",
    "in the color - singlet picture , three production modes are involved in the inclusive @xmath0 production processes , as shown in fig .",
    "1 and fig .  2 .",
    "we refer them to the qcd @xmath36 production ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , the qed @xmath36 production ( fig .",
    "1(b),(c),(d ) ) and the @xmath24 production ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "other qed processes such as @xmath38 where the @xmath39 forms a lepton or quark pair ( except for the charm pair ) have been regarded as the background and removed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 production was initially investigated twenty years ago and was taken as the most important production mode in comparison with the color - octet production in the old - fashioned `` color - evaporation model ''  @xcite .",
    "the calculations on the qcd @xmath36 production have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite and shows that the cross section is comparatively smaller than that of @xmath24 production . in the case of the @xmath40-channel qed @xmath36 production ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the cross section is only 1/6 of the qcd one and the modest effects are expected . here in spite of a suppression factor",
    "@xmath41 compared to the qcd @xmath36 production , the @xmath40-channel diagrams of the qed @xmath36 process should be taken into account due to the enhancement of powers of @xmath42 , which is studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to the furry s theorem",
    ", the density matrix of the interferences between @xmath43- and @xmath40- channel @xmath36 processes ( including the @xmath43- channel qcd diagrams ) vanishes when @xmath44 angular distributions in the @xmath44 rest frame are integrated out .",
    "we also calculate the corrections from @xmath43-channel qed productions ( the detailed procedures of our calculations will be shown later ) [ qedinter ] & = & -3.0%+3.510 ^ -3 , + & = & 2.0%+1.010 ^ -4 , where the symbols @xmath45 represent the contributions to the total cross section from diagrams fig .",
    "1(a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . the first values on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ qedinter ] ) represent the corrections from the interference terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while the second values represent the direct corrections @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the interference between the diagrams ( a ) and ( c ) is negative , which is consistent with the qed corrections to the exclusive process @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the sum of the above corrections from the @xmath43-channel qed processes contributes to the total @xmath50 cross section destructively by about 1% , which is sufficiently small and can be neglected safely .",
    "therefore , in the rest of the paper , we refer only to the @xmath40-channel qed @xmath51 production of fig1 .",
    "( b ) as the qed process .",
    "truein    1.25 truein    it has been noted that the color - octet process @xmath52_8",
    "g \\to j/\\psi g$ ] exhibits a remarkably different property with all of the above three color - singlet productions .",
    "this process gives rise to a hard spectrum where the @xmath0 momentum is almost maximal because of its two - body final state  @xcite .",
    "this has been a crucial feature used in experiments to distinguish the color - octet contributions .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , no such signature has been detected by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "recent investigation reveals that the color - octet contribution to the @xmath0 spectrum can be broaden significantly by the large perturbative corrections and enhanced nonperturbative effects  @xcite . in this sense , one can not rule out the color - octet contribution from current experimental data yet .",
    "however , as concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the unknown color - octet shape functions for the @xmath0 production , the dominant @xmath53 cross section must be understood accurately before extracting the color - octet contributions from the data .",
    "we now present our leading - order calculations .",
    "the traditional approach for @xmath54-wave productions is either calculating the helicity amplitudes by using a covariant projection formalism in the csm , or evaluating the squared amplitudes directly with the help of the optical theorem in the general nrqcd factorization framework . to the lowest order in the power expansion in the relativistic velocity @xmath55 of the heavy quark and anti - quark , the two methods are identical with each other . in this paper",
    ", we develop a much simpler numerical method for the amplitude calculations .",
    "first we apply the program madgraph  @xcite to generate the parton - level helicity amplitudes for the processes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and then combine a color - singlet @xmath44 pair to be a @xmath0 meson by using the helas subroutines  @xcite .",
    "we leave the detailed procedure for constructing the helicity amplitudes for nrqcd processes in the appendix .",
    "finally the integration over the phase space of the squared amplitudes are performed by the monte carlo program bases  @xcite .",
    "this approach avoids lengthy trace computations and allows us to obtain various production and decay angular distributions from the density matrices that can easily be obtained from the helicity amplitudes .    in our numerical analysis",
    "we use the input parameter values as follows : the center - of - mass energy @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . the radial wave function for @xmath0 at the origin @xmath62 is measured through the leptonic decay width @xmath63 , [ wave ] |r(0)|^2=(j / e^+e^-)=0.447  gev^3 , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . here we adopt the @xmath62 value obtained from the above leading - order formula , rather than from the next - to - leading - order one  @xcite or from some potential models  @xcite , in order to define the renormalization @xmath6 factor of the @xmath0 production cross section unanimously .    with the above parameters , the leading - order cross sections for the inclusive @xmath0 processes are given as [ lead ] _",

    "@xcite . both @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "contribute to the total inclusive cross section at @xmath71 , while @xmath70 contributes at @xmath72 .",
    "the qed cross section is enhanced by powers of @xmath42 .",
    "as we shall see , the contribution from the qed @xmath36 production affects the angular distributions significantly at larger @xmath0 momenta .",
    "we also examine the consistency of our numerical results with the fragmentation approximation in the high energy limit ; @xmath73 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the charm quark fragmentation function into @xmath0 has been defined as _",

    "we confirm the above result numerically and find that the deviation between the fragmentation formula ( [ frag ] ) and the exact differential cross section decreases as @xmath76 at high energies .",

    "both @xmath79 and @xmath86 are defined in the @xmath1 collision center - of - mass frame .    from fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , we observe that although the qed @xmath36 cross section is much smaller than the qcd one , its effects in the high momentum region and at large @xmath87 can not be neglected .",
    "this is due to the characteristics of the photon fragmentation diagrams where one virtual photon fragments into a charmonium and another one evolves into a @xmath44 pair ( see the left - most feynman diagram in fig .",
    "the photon fragmentation configurations make up 71% of the qed cross section , while the rest comes from the interference terms and non - fragmentation terms . in the end - point region @xmath88 , only the @xmath24 mode is allowed .",
    "the differential cross sections for the qcd @xmath36 and the @xmath24 productions are restricted by unitarity , parity , and angular momentum considerations and can be parameterized to a simple form  @xcite [ cos ] = s(z)[1+(z)^2 ] , where the angular coefficient @xmath89 is generally limited in the interval @xmath90 .",

    "these features can be confirmed in fig .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) , where we show the fraction of transversally polarized @xmath0 as function of @xmath79 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the above cosine - square behavior in eq .",

    "both the qcd and qed cross sections are dominated by the transverse @xmath0 , and the transverse @xmath0 fraction increases with the @xmath0 momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "an opposite behavior is obtained for @xmath24 .",
    "we point out here that the transverse fraction for the qcd @xmath36 production approaches to unity as @xmath79 reaches 0.90 , the maximum for the process .",
    "this feature is not clearly seen in fig .",
    "3(c ) due to the finite bin size , but has been checked numerically .",
    "it indicates that all @xmath0 mesons are transversely polarized if the associated @xmath44 has vanishing relative momentum .",
    "this is consistent with the exclusive double - charmonium production @xmath25 where all @xmath0 mesons are transversely polarized .",
    "the scattering - angle distributions are also quite distinct from each other ; as shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) . in the region of the small scattering angles ,",
    "the transverse components for the qcd @xmath36 and @xmath24 processes are comparatively larger than those in the large - angle region . for the qed @xmath36 process",
    ", the transverse fraction rapidly falls off in the region @xmath97",
    ".    5 truein",
    "we note that although the contribution from the @xmath24 process is significant in the end - point region @xmath98 in our leading - order calculations , there is no such apparent signal observed by experiments .",
    "the probable reason of this discrepancy is that nrqcd does not include collinear degrees of freedom at large @xmath79 and therefore both the perturbative expansion and the operator product expansion ( ope ) break down  @xcite .",
    "the problem can be cured by combining nrqcd for the heavy degrees of freedom with the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) for the light degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a similar problem occurs in the radiative decay @xmath34 at large @xmath99 energies as mentioned in sec .",
    "1 . in refs .  @xcite , it has been shown that the prediction of scet in the end - point region of the @xmath99 energy distribution is much closer to the cleo data than the leading - order calculations in nrqcd .    in this paper instead of performing the complicated calculations within scet , we adopt a phenomenological approach to obtain an appropriate end - point spectrum for the @xmath24 process by noting that in scet , the operator of @xmath100 is in the same form as that of @xmath101 .",
    "it is further observed that , the collinear sudakov factor of @xmath30 decay arises solely from the gluon jet function . in the leading power expansion of scet",
    ", the jet function depends only on the large light - cone momentum component .",
    "it is easy to find that , the large momentum component of two - gluon jet of @xmath101 decay ( @xmath102 ) is roughly equal to that of @xmath103 process ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this implies that the collinear sudakov factor of these two processes are quite similar .",
    "therefore it should be a reasonable approximation that these two processes have the same collinear suppression function .",
    "accordingly , we disentangle the collinear suppression function @xmath105 from the experimental data and the tree level prediction for @xmath34 as = f(z ) , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the decay width for the experimental measurement and the leading - order calculation respectively .",
    "@xmath108 is the normalized photon energy and can be expressed as a function of the invariant mass of the two gluons z==1- .",
    "we assume that the function @xmath105 can be parameterized as [ func ] f(z)= \\ {    ll 1&for  0z0.5 + ( 1-z)exp(c_1 z+c_2 z^2 ) & for  0.5<z1    . with two free parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we find a good fit to the data and by using the lo calculation presented in ref .",

    "we expect that this is a good approximation because the energy scale of the two processes is roughly the same .",
    "integrating over @xmath79 , the total cross section is reduced to [ sup ] _",

    "the suppression effect starts at around @xmath114 .",
    "as @xmath79 is close to unity , the differential cross section drops to zero , which diminishes the disagreement with the belle data .",
    "the angular distribution is modified slightly , as shown in fig .",
    "the cross section in the central region ( @xmath115 ) is suppressed most because that the large @xmath79 component dominated by the longitudinally polarized @xmath0 mesons is suppressed significantly .",

    "cc/(_cc+ _ gg)=75% .",
    "a part of the large @xmath6 factor may come from the uncertainty in the wave function at the origin . by replacing the leading - order formula of the leptonic @xmath0 decay in eq .",

    "another factor of two from the higher - order corrections to the hard scattering part may lead to the combined effect as large as @xmath133 . for the qed @xmath50 case , since the fragmentation configurations are dominant , the ratio @xmath134 is approximately a constant to any order of qcd perturbation theory .",

    ", the relativistic corrections should not exceed that for the exclusive one . therefore if one knows how large the relativistic corrections affect the total cross section , a significant fraction of the large @xmath6 factor may be explained .    before closing the discussion , we note here that we find no evidence of the color - octet contribution to the prompt @xmath0 production process . if its contribution is significant , the color - singlet contribution to the @xmath24 process should be further suppressed in order to keep the large fraction of the @xmath197 process .",
