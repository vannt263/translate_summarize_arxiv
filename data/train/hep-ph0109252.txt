    "inflation is today considered a natural and necessary part of the cosmological standard model , providing the initial conditions for cosmic microwave background radiation and large scale structure formation .",
    "our knowledge of the fundamental physics responsible for inflation is , however , very limited , and only recent observations of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite and large scale structure  @xcite have provided the first glimpse of the underlying physics . this has been achieved ( and is still only possible ) in slow roll inflation ( see @xcite for a review on slow roll and list of references ) .    for",
    "any given inflationary model one can find the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations , @xmath3 , which is a function of the wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "this power spectrum can be taylor - expanded about some wavenumber @xmath5 and truncated after a few terms  @xcite @xmath6 where the first term is a normalization constant , the second is the power - law approximation , with the case @xmath7 corresponding to a scale invariant ( harrison - zeldovich ) spectrum , and the third term is the running of the spectral index .",
    "early data analyses  @xcite have truncated this expansion after the first two terms , hence assuming that the bend of the spectrum is zero , @xmath8 . however , as shown in  @xcite , this early truncation gives too strong constraints on both scalar and tensor indices , and the analysis must allow for a bend of the spectrum . in most slow roll ( sr )",
    "models @xmath9 is expected to be very small , since it is second order in small parameters  @xcite , but there are very interesting models where this need not be the case  @xcite , and @xmath9 may assume values big enough to be observable  ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the more general sr models are constrained through the expansion  ( [ power ] ) , which can provide constraints on the first two derivatives of the inflaton potential  @xcite .    in sr",
    "it is straight forward to find the derivatives of the scalar and tensor spectral indices  @xcite , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and these two provide the flow equations in sr space  @xcite .",
    "we discuss below how one can combine present day observation with these flow equations to obtain a non - trivial bound on the third derivative of the inflaton potential , @xmath12 ( or combinations like @xmath13 ) , under the assumption that @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) can be treated as approximately constant .",
    "* the flow equations*. slow roll models are traditionally defined through the 3 parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which roughly correspond to the first , second and third derivatives of the inflaton potential .",
    "we will use the notation  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath18 gev , from which one can express the sr parameters using the directly observable quantities @xmath19 and @xmath9 @xmath20 where @xmath1 is the tensor to scalar ratio at the quadrupole .",

    "as the inflaton rolls down the potential , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 will change , and this variation is governed by the flow equations  @xcite @xmath30 + 2 \\xi^2 \\ , , \\label{flow1 } \\\\",

    "the connection between @xmath15 and @xmath34 through @xmath35 is given by equations  ( [ definitions ] ) , @xmath36 .",
    "certainly one can find good inflationary models , which do not obey this slow - roll description .",
    "this could e.g. appear , because the derivation of the slow - roll equations is based on the assumption of a slowly varying hubble parameter , which for particular models could be violated .",
    "as @xmath32 decreases , the inflaton rolls down its potential , and the observable parameters are determined when the relevant scales cross outside the horizon , approximately 50 - 60 e - folds before the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "single field inflation will end , when the sr conditions are violated  @xcite @xmath37 the area in @xmath38 space inside this boundary is denoted the sr `` validity - region '' .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show this region , and also examples of the flow of two models ( dotted lines ) .",
    "an almost trivial observation is that the region allowed by current observations , given in ( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) , lies inside the sr validity - region .",
    "= 7.2 cm    in order to close the set of equations , so that the flow equations uniquely define the time evolution of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we need to introduce an additional constraint , and there are various possibilities . in ref .",

    "another possibility would be to assume that either @xmath12 or @xmath15 can be treated as constants .",
    "different choices will lead to different fix - points and different time evolution of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and general conclusions are therefore only credible if such conclusions are reached for any choice of this additional constraint .    *",
    "observational constraints*. the cobe observations  @xcite gave the first constraint on the first derivative @xmath41 and the present day constraints on slow roll parameters are improved when combining cmb data with data from the lyman-@xmath42 forest .",
    "the reason being that the error - ellipses for cmb and lyman-@xmath42 are almost perpendicular  @xcite .",
    "the reason for using lyman-@xmath42 data  @xcite instead of `` standard '' lss data ( such as pscz  @xcite or 2dfgrs  @xcite ) is , that the lyman-@xmath42 data are obtained at high red - shift , where small scales are still linear .",
    "one should naturally keep in mind , that neither cmb nor ly-@xmath42 data include all the possible systematic errors .",
    "the bounds obtained are  @xcite ( all at @xmath43 ) @xmath44 where @xmath28 is the scalar spectral index , @xmath1 is the tensor to scalar ratio , and @xmath45 is the bend defined through eq .",

    "eqs .  ( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) limit only @xmath15 to be smaller than about @xmath47 , when assuming independent errors on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and in reality one could obtain a slightly stronger bound . to obtain a bound on @xmath50",
    "we must combine the observational constraints ( [ obsns]-[obsdlnk ] ) with the flow equations in sr parameter space , eqs .",
    "( [ flow1],[flow2 ] ) .",
    "this is because one has @xmath51 $ ] , and since we do nt have a lower bound on @xmath1 we can not get any direct constraint on @xmath12 .",
    "we are going to consider the case , where slow - roll inflation is ended because the slow - roll conditions are violated , eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "another possibility would be to allow for other fields coupled to the inflaton field which could end inflation .",
    "the parameters observable with cmb and lss are determined approximately 50 e - folds before the end of inflation , and we therefore run the sr violating boundary back in time 50 e - folds .",
    "this is done for various values of fixed @xmath15 ( or fixed @xmath12 ) .",
    "now we demand that the observable parameters be in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ obsns ] ) , and if no point on the sr violating boundary lands inside the observed parameter - range , then we can exclude this value of @xmath15 ( or @xmath12 ) .",
    "= 7.2 cm    let us first consider the case where @xmath15 can be treated as a constant during the 50 e - folds . if @xmath52 one finds , that 50 e - folds before the crossing of the sr violating boundary one has @xmath53 when we demand that @xmath54 complies with eq .",
    "( [ obsns ] ) .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the thicker solid line is for @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath15 is positive then @xmath1 must be even smaller , since the region in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] moves to the right ( larger @xmath54 ) , and for @xmath55 there are no more points in agreement with observations . for negative @xmath15",
    "the acceptable values of @xmath1 are larger than @xmath56 , and for @xmath57 there are no points in agreement with observations .",
    "we hence conclude , that in the case where @xmath15 can be considered constant throughout the 50 e - folds and inflation ends by violating the slow - roll conditions , one must have @xmath58 .",
    "we therefore find a constraint on @xmath59 similar to ( [ obsdlnk ] ) from the observational constraints on @xmath54 and the flow equations alone .",
    "this bound on @xmath15 can be converted into a bound on @xmath12 using the predicted @xmath1 and the relation @xmath36 .",
    "we find @xmath60 .",
    "if one instead considers the case where @xmath12 can be treated as a constant during the 50 e - folds , then the conclusions are slightly different .",
    "again , in the case with @xmath61 one finds @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath12 is negative then no points agree with observations if @xmath63 .",
    "only for positive @xmath12 there will always be acceptable points , however , the allowed range for @xmath1 will decrease , e.g. for @xmath64 one finds @xmath65 .    as discussed above",
    ", the most credible results must agree independently of the additional constraint ( fixed @xmath15 or fixed @xmath12 ) .",
    "we have seen that one always finds a lower bound @xmath66 this is the first constraint found on the third derivative of the inflaton potential , and is valid under the assumptions specified above .",
    "it is important to note , that the approach adopted here differs from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out , that an observation of @xmath9 would provide knowledge about @xmath50 .",
    "the difference being , that in our case we have only an observational _ upper bound _ on @xmath1 , and without the use of the flow equations , this will leave @xmath50 completely unknown .",
    "no strong predictions can be made on the magnitude of @xmath1 , simply because if @xmath12 is large then @xmath1 is allowed to be smaller , however , one would often expect @xmath34 to be smaller than both @xmath67 and @xmath68 , eqs .",
    "( [ obsv],[obsv  ] ) , in which case one predicts @xmath2 .",
    "the number of e - folds @xmath32 depends on the detailed mechanism of inflation such as the reheat temperature and the energy scale of inflation , and can be somewhat different from 50 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath69 our direct bound on @xmath70 remains unchanged , however , the inferred bound from the case of constant @xmath15 is weakened by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "the lower bound on r discussed above becomes @xmath71 .",
    "naturally , for a lower value of @xmath32 the bounds are correspondingly stronger .",
    "cobe gave us the first clear information on the first derivative of the inflaton potential , and the combination of cmb observations with data from the lyman-@xmath42 forest has given us information on the first two derivatives of the inflaton potential .",
    "here we have combined the present observations with the flow equations in slow roll space , and found a lower bound on the third derivative of the inflaton potential @xmath0 .",
    "we have also shown , that unless @xmath12 is unreasonably large , then one predicts the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath1 , to be bounded from below @xmath72 .",
