    "irreversible adsorption is of major significance for many fields such as medicine and material sciences as well as pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries .",
    "for example , adsorption of some proteins is crucial for blood coagulation , inflammatory response , fouling of contact lenses , plaque formation , ultrafiltration and the operation of membrane filtration units .",
    "moreover , controlled adsorption is fundamental for efficient chromatographic separation and purification , gel electrophoresis , filtration , as well as the performance of bioreactors , biosensing and immunological assays .",
    "random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) , since its introduction by feder @xcite , has became a well established method used in numerical modelling of irreversible adsorption of , at first spherical molecules , and then of complex ones such us polymers or proteins , e.g. @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that , for the purposes of adsorption modelling , complex molecules can be successfully approximated using coarse - grain models @xcite .",
    "for example , a coarse - grain model of fibrinogen can successfully explain the density of adsorbed monolayer for a wide range of experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "this study focuses on the rsa of tetramers on a flat and homogeneous two dimensional collector surface .",
    "the interest in this topic was aroused by the work of adamczyk et al .",
    "@xcite , who had experimentally measured adsorption of a kfra plasmid and shown that it aggregates to a tetramer during adsorption . however , the tetramer structure is common for a number of substrates .",
    "some of the latest theoretical studies in this field investigate ag tetramer @xcite and melanin @xcite ; however , by using the density - functional approach . on the other hand , in similar works involving rsa modelling ,",
    "dimer @xcite and polymer adsorption @xcite has been studied .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to find the maximal random coverage ratio of monolayers built as a result of the irreversible tetramer adsorption .",
    "additionally , i want to calculate parameters needed to estimate the kinetics of the adsorption process .",
    "in this study two independent models of a tetramer are considered . in the first one , spheres of radius @xmath0 , which represent monomers , form a rhomboid ( rhomboid model ) whereas in the second one , these spheres are placed at vertices of a square ( square model ) ; see fig.[fig : model ] .    .",
    "centres of monomers form a rhomboid ( left ) or a square ( right).,width=226 ]    modelled molecules are placed on a flat homogeneous collector surface according to the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) algorithm @xcite , which iteratively repeats the following steps :    1 .",
    ": :    a virtual tetramer is created .",
    "its position and orientation on a    collector is chosen randomly according to the uniform probability    distribution ; however , centres of all the components ( see    fig.[fig : model ] ) are required to be on a collector ; 2 . : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbours of the virtual molecule .",
    "the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between each of the spheres is greater    than zero ; 3 . : :    if there is no overlap the virtual molecule is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer",
    ". its position does not change    during further calculations ; 4 .",
    ": :    if there is an overlap , the virtual tetramer is removed and abandoned .",
    "the number of rsa iterations @xmath1 is typically expressed in dimensionless time units : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an area covered by a single tetramer and @xmath4 is a collector size . in case of these simulations ,",
    "square collectors were used with a side size of @xmath5 , so @xmath6 , and algorithm was stopped after @xmath7 .",
    "obtained example coverages are presented in fig.[fig : examples ] .",
    "the main parameter observed during simulation was a coverage ratio @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a number of adsorbed molecules after time @xmath11 . to decrease statistical error ,",
    "@xmath12 independent rsa simulations were performed for a single model .",
    "the main property of an adsorption layer is its maximal coverage ratio - the area covered by particles adsorbed after a long enough period of time .",
    "moreover , the adsorption kinetics can also be measured ; however , it depends not only on the properties of collector and adsorbate particles , but also on the transport process , which brings those particles to surface proximity . on the other hand , due to a finite time of the rsa simulation , kinetics of the process has to be known to get appropriate values of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , both the maximal coverage ratio and adsorption kinetics should be analysed together .",
    "the kinetics of the rsa of spheres obeys the feder law @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a collector dimension and @xmath11 is a dimensionless time ( [ eq : dimlesstime ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ fl ] ) has been proved numerically for a one to six dimensional space  @xcite and also for fractal collectors , having @xmath16  @xcite , as well as for @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "feder s law appeared to be valid also for different adsorbates like dimers  @xcite and polymers @xcite , however , for highly anisotropic molecules , parameter @xmath15 grows with a number of degrees of freedom of adsorbate particle @xcite .    for large enough time @xmath11 ,",
    "the exponent can be measured directly from @xmath18 dependence on @xmath11 using the least squares approximation method ( see fig.[fig : dnt ] ) .",
    ": @xmath19 for rhomboid model and @xmath20 for square model .",
    "corresponding values of exponent @xmath15 in ( [ fl ] ) are @xmath21 and @xmath22 for rhomboid and square model , respectively.,width=226 ]    it is interesting , that the obtained values of parameter @xmath15 for both the models are significantly higher than @xmath23 , which is expected value for spherical particles .",
    "it suggests that orientational degree of freedom of the model of plasmid aggregate can not be neglected , even though the shape anisotropy in this case is quite small .",
    "having determined the exponent @xmath15 let @xmath24 .",
    "then eq.([fl ] ) follows to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a constant coefficient .",
    "approximation of this linear relation for @xmath27 reveals the maximal random coverage @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the rhomboid and square model , respectively .",
    "the relative error of both values is approx . @xmath30 .",
    "the difference is significant but relatively small and therefore it could not be measured experimentally , as the typical error of experimental methods is at the level of @xmath31 . in both the cases , the maximal random coverage ratio is smaller than @xmath32 obtained for spheres @xcite , dimers @xcite or very short polymers @xcite .",
    "adsorption of tetramers has been measured experimentally by adamczyk et al.@xcite ; they studied adsorption of kfra plasmid on latex particles .",
    "kfra plasmid is a spherical @xmath33 kda particle and with a diameter of @xmath34 nm .",
    "however , the study has shown that kfra aggregates .",
    "the size of the aggregate indicates that it contains four plasmids .",
    "afm observation suggest that the aggregate can be described by the rhomboid model .",
    "obtained values of maximal coverage ratio corresponds to surface density of @xmath35 mg / m@xmath36 of kfra , and is almost twice higher than measured experimentally .",
    "however , kfra plasmids have uncompensated charge of 12 @xmath37 @xcite , which significantly lowers the coverage density due to electrostatic repulsion @xcite .",
    "using effective equation @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is measured coverage and @xmath40 is the effective interaction range characterising the repulsive double - layer interaction and depends on electrostatic properties of a particles as well as dielectric properties of the solution , one can find the value of @xmath40 . in this case , it is @xmath41 for the rhomboid model and @xmath42 for the square one .",
    "adsorption kinetics is governed by two factors .",
    "the first one is transport process shifting molecules to surface proximity .",
    "as it depends on a given experiment s conditions , it hardly enters the general theoretical analysis .",
    "the second factor is probability of adsorption ; it decreases in time due to diminishing area of uncovered collector surface .",
    "the dependence between adsorption probability and temporary coverage ratio is known as available surface function ( asf ) and it can be easily determined from the rsa simulation .",
    "its dependence on normalised coverage @xmath43 is shown in fig.[fig : asf ] .    )",
    "obtained for @xmath44 : @xmath45 for the rhomboid model and @xmath46 for the square one.,width=226 ]    at the limit of low coverage , the @xmath47 is commonly approximated by a quadratic fit @xcite : @xmath48 the expansion coefficients @xmath49 corresponds to the surface area blocked by a single tetramer , whereas @xmath50 denotes a cross - section of the area blocked by two independent molecules .",
    "both of them have major significance because they are directly related to the second @xmath51 and third @xmath52 viral coefficients of the equilibrium tetramer monolayer @xcite .",
    "for example , the 2d pressure @xmath53 and the chemical potential of tetramer @xmath54 can be expressed via the series expansion at a low coverage limit @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath57 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath58 is the reference potential .",
    "results presented in fig.[fig : asf ] show that @xmath49 is slightly bigger for the square model , which is expected as the overall size of the particle in this model is slightly bigger than in the rhomboid one .",
    "it is also worth to notice that the mean surface blocked by a tetramer is approximately @xmath59 larger than for a spherical particle , for which @xmath60 . on the other hand , in case of tetramers @xmath61 , whereas for spheres @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , due to opposite signs at @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq.[eq : asffit ] , the asf difference between spheres and tetramers is getting smaller for slightly larger coverages , when the parameter @xmath50 becomes more important .",
    "note that in a limit of small coverages @xmath63 can also be estimated experimentally .",
    "it has been shown that in these conditions @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a normalised variance of the number of adsorbed particles @xcite . the typical experimental procedure used for estimation of @xmath66 , described in @xcite ,",
    "can be used also for monolayers generated by the rsa .",
    "fig.[fig : varasf ] shows results of such calculations for tetramer layers in comparison with theoretical fit ( [ eq : asffit ] ) obtained above .    .",
    "diamonds and squares are measured values for rhomboid and square model , respectively ; whereas solid lines correspond to the asf fit in a low coverage limit ( [ eq : asffit]).,width=226 ]    as expected , agreement is good only for @xmath44 .    at the jamming limit",
    ", the asf for anisotropic molecules is typically approximated by @xcite : @xmath67 as shown in fig.[fig : asf ] inset , the above relation is also valid for tetramer adsorption .",
    "the fit can be directly used for finding adsorption kinetics when transport is provided by diffusion or convection .",
    "details of this procedure have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the density autocorrelation function gives additional insight into coverages structure .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a probability of finding two tetramers in a distance between @xmath70 and @xmath71 . here , the distance @xmath70 is measured between the geometric centres of tetramers .",
    "parameter @xmath72 is the mean density of particles inside a covering layer .",
    "such a normalisation leads to @xmath73 . in the case of spherical particles",
    ", @xmath74 has a logarithmic singularity in the touching limit @xcite and superexponential decay at large distances @xcite .",
    "the density autocorrelation function is shown in fig.[fig : cor ] .    .",
    "parameter @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the rhomboid and square model , respectively.,width=226 ]    it can be noticed that the autocorrelation density for the rhomboid model is slightly shifted left compared to the one for the square model .",
    "this is due to slightly denser packing of monomers in the rhomboid model and , hence , a somewhat smaller distance possible between the particles .",
    "the first maximum is smaller because rhomboid shape anisotropy is bigger than the square one , which results in broader dispersion of possible distances . due to anisotropy of shapes in both models",
    "used , there is no singularity at small @xmath70 .",
    "however , the @xmath74 slope past the first maximum resembles logarithmic singularity , especially for the square model , which is shown in the fig.[fig : cor ] inset . for large @xmath70 , autocorrelations approaches their limit value very fast , which is similar to the case of spheres maximal random coverages .",
    "the maximal random coverage ratio of a tetramer monolayer is @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the rhomboid and square model , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the ratio is slightly smaller than for spheres . on the other hand , in a limit of low coverage density ,",
    "the surface is filled approximately @xmath59 faster by tetramers than by equally sized spheres . at jamming limit",
    ", rsa of tetramers shows behaviour typical to anisotropic molecules , which is rather unexpected considering small shape anisotropy of both models used .",
    "properties of the density autocorrelation function are similar to those of the case of spheres .",
