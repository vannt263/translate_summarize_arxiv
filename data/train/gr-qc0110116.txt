    "some of the most interesting effects that general relativity predicts for the orbit of a test body in the field of a central mass are the secular lense - thirring gravitomagnetic precessions of the node @xmath1 and the pericenter @xmath2 , generated by the off - diagonal terms of the stationary part of the spacetime metric ( lense and thirring , 1918 ; ciufolini and wheeler , 1995 ) , and the secular einstein s gravitoelectric precession of the pericenter , induced by the schwarzschild s static part of the spacetime metric ( ciufolini and wheeler , 1995 ) .",
    "their expressions , in the weak - field and slow - motion approximation , referred to an asymptotically inertial frame of reference with its origin in the center of mass of the central body , are _ gm & = & , + _ gm & = & - , + _ ge & = & , in which @xmath3 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath4 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the proper angular momentum and the mass , respectively , of the central body , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the semimajor axis , the eccentricity and the inclination , respectively , of the orbit of the test mass and @xmath10 is its mean motion .    in the weak field of solar system such features are very tiny and difficult to measure because of lots of other competing classical effects which in many cases are quite larger than them . to - day , the lense - thirring effect has been measured , with @xmath11 accuracy , in the gravitational field of the earth by means of the laser - ranged data to lageos and lageos ii satellites ( ciufolini , 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , the ambitious gp - b mission ( everitt et al . , 2001 ) , which is scheduled to be launched in spring 2002 , will measure the effect of the gravitomagnetic field of the earth on orbiting gyroscopes at a claimed precision of 1@xmath12 .",
    "the einstein s precession of the pericenter has been detected in the well - known radar ranging measurements of the mercury s perihelion advance in the field of the sun with @xmath13 or better accuracy ( shapiro , 1990 ) .    in general ,",
    "it should be pointed out that the experimental basis of general relativity is not yet particularly wide because , from one hand , it is difficult to work out new predictions of the theory which could be effectively detected , and , from the other hand , it is not easy to perform experiments , even for those effects which are already well known theoretically , or which have been already tested in some particular contexts . the gravitomagnetic lense  thirring drag and the gravitoelectric einstein pericenter shift fall in this category , so that , in the author s opinion , every effort aimed to the investigation of the possibility of enlarging the experimental foundations of general relativity in various contexts and by using different techniques deserves attention .    recent years have seen increasing efforts in selenodetic activity conducted by several lunar missions like clementine and lunar prospector .",
    "one of the main goals of such missions is the mapping of the lunar gravity field ( lemoine et al . , 1997 ;",
    "konopoliv et al . , 1998 ; 2001 ) .",
    "such kinds of selenodetic missions seem to be just the natural candidates in order to detect direct general relativistic effects of the lunar gravitational field on the orbit of test bodies .",
    "indeed , about the moon dynamics , we can speak , in a global sense , of the motions of the moon s center of mass and , in a local sense , of the motions around its center of mass . recently , many general relativistic features of the global motion of the moon in the sun s gravitational field , among which the most famous is the geodetic or de sitter precession , have been investigated both theoretically ( mashhoon and theiss , 1991 ; 2001 ) and experimentally ( ciufolini , 2001 ; nordvedt , 2001 ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate quantitatively the possibility of measuring the impact of general relativity in the local dynamics of a satellite  moon system with particular emphasis to the selene mission . knowing the present  day level of experimental sensitivity to two of the most important general relativistic direct effects in the moon s gravitational field may help to focus further attentions to the lunar arena or to redirect them to other , more feasible and promising scenarios .",
    "the plan of the work is the following . in section 2 the relativistic effects on the selene subsatellites",
    "are analyzed . in section 3 their values",
    "are compared to the obtainable experimental accuracy .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the forthcoming japanese selene mission ( ohta et al . , 2000 ) is of relevant scientific interest . it is currently under development by national space development agency of japan ( nasda ) and institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , and",
    "will be launched in 2004 to elucidate lunar origin and evolution .",
    "selene is composed of main orbiter , and two micro sub - satellites ; the relay satellite ( rstar ) and the vlbi radio satellite ( vstar ) which will be used for selenodesy experiments . the range - rate accuracy for the three subsatellites should amount to @xmath14 mm s@xmath15 ( heki et al . , 1999 )",
    "( sampling interval 20 - 60 seconds , doppler ) .",

    "we will focus our attention to the gravitoelectric post - newtonian periselenium advance which is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger than the gravitomagnetic effects , as can be inferred from tab .",
    "indeed , it should be noticed that the present - day quality of force models applicable to low lunar satellites does not allow highly precise determination of their orbits .",
    "the largely unknown gravitational potential of the moon remains the most important perturbation force acting upon low lunar satellites ( floberghagen et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the relativistic gravitoelectric perturbation affects only the pericenter of the orbit of a test particle , as can be inferred from a straightforward calculation based on the radial , transverse and cross - track components of the related disturbing acceleration ( grafarend and joos , 1992 ) .",
    "this implies that the relativistic effect of interest can be mapped onto an along - track shift .",
    "indeed , in general ( christodoulidis et al . , 1988 ) the along - track perturbation can be written as s = a.the element @xmath47 is the mean anomaly . in the case of the gravitoelectric pericenter shift it reduces to s_ge = a_ge.for main orbiter and",
    "rstar it yields the effects quoted in tab . 4 for different arc lengths which are of common use , e.g. , in typical lunar gravity field mapping missions .",
    "llll arc length & main orbiter & rstar + @xmath48 week & @xmath49 m & @xmath50 m + @xmath51 weeks & @xmath52 m & @xmath53 m + @xmath54 weeks & @xmath55 m & @xmath56 m +    in order to investigate if such effects are within the present - day or near forthcoming orbit accuracy of lunar missions we rely on the results presented in ( floberghagen et al . , 1999 ) . in it",
    "the rms of orbit fit for a test case where the satellite polar orbits are determined through low - low satellite - to - satellite tracking ( sst ) in combination with earth - based ground tracking is presented . as input models for the gravity field and the albedo the glgm-2 lunar gravity model ( lemoine et al . , 1997 ) and dlam-1 lunar albedo model ( floberghagen et al . , 1999 ) , respectively , are adopted .",
    "it should be noticed that , due to the non - conservative nature of the albedo force , the longer the arc , the larger the orbit error . for the integrated sst doppler measurements a sampling rate of 20 s is assumed with a precision of @xmath14 mm s@xmath15 . for arc lengths of one week of a polar 100 km altitude satellite the along - track rms is of the order of some meters or even of @xmath57 m , as can be inferred from tab . 2 of ( floberghagen et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is almost 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than the general relativistic gravitoelectric effect on selene main orbiter quoted in tab .",
    "4 .    these results seem to be confirmed also by the estimates of the contribution of differential vlbi ( @xmath58vlbi ) to the standard 2-way doppler which allows for three dimensional orbit determination of the selene main orbiter summarized in fig . 2 of ( heki et al . , 1999 ) . over an arc length of 12 hours",
    "the along - track accuracy amounts almost to 1 m , while the along - track gravitoelectric relativistic shift , over the same time span is @xmath59 m.    in order to get an order of magnitude of the main systematic error which could affect such kind of measurement we will calculate the mismodelled classical precession of the periselenium of main orbiter induced by the first even zonal harmonic @xmath0 of the moon s gravity field according to the lp75 g lunar gravity model ( konopoliv et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the rate of the classical pericenter advance due to the first even zonal harmonic is _ class=-()^2(1 - 5 ^ 2i).according to tab . 1 and tab .",
    "2 we have @xmath60 s@xmath15 which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the relativistic gravitoelectric periselenium shift , as can be inferred from tab .",
    ", this specific kind of problems could be overcome by adopting suitable orbital residuals combinations , as done in the terrestrial field for the lense - thirring lageos experiment ( ciufolini , 2000 ) .",
    "however , it should be also considered that , in the case of an orbital motion around the moon the long  term perturbations due to the odd zonal harmonics of the lunar gravitational field play a role much more important that in the earth case ( kne@xmath61evi@xmath62 and milani , 1998 ) , especially for the eccentricity @xmath8 and the pericenter @xmath2 .",
    "the present - day level of accuracy of satellite selenodesy does not allow the detection of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric precessions of the satellites orbits in the field of the moon .",
    "for example , such effects on the selene subsatellites are , at most , 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes smaller than the obtainable orbit accuracy .",
    "this holds for the gravitoelectric periselenium advance of main orbiter .",
    "the systematic errors which would be induced by the poor knowledge of the lunar gravity field are almost 3 orders of magnitude larger than the gravitoeletric periselenium advance of main orbiter .",
