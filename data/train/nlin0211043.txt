    "cellular automata are mathematical models of physical systems in which space and time variables are discrete , and physical quantities take only finite number of values @xcite . in spite of simple formulation",
    "they are capable to describe wide variety of phenomena , for example traffic flow , immune systems , flow through porous media , fluid dynamics , ferromagnetism . due to their completely discrete nature",
    "cellular automata are naturally suitable for computer simulations .",
    "however in this field there are not so many exact analytical results providing solutions with a given global behavior .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a general method of construction of solutions to the cellular automaton associated with the hirota equation .    the hirota equation @xcite , the integrable discretization of the generalized toda system @xcite , is one of the most important soliton equations .",
    "its various limits give rise to variety of integrable equations , moreover it is the basic system for studying solvable quantum models @xcite .    like many other integrable systems the hirota equation has simple geometric interpretation . in the paper",
    "we will use the following ( geometric ) form of the hirota equation @xmath6 one can describe it as the equation governing the so called laplace sequence of two dimensional lattices of planar quadrilaterals @xcite . this interpretation can be embedded into a more general theory of multidimensional lattices of planar quadrilaterals and their transformations @xcite .",

    "the question of construction of integrable systems with solutions taking values in a discrete set ( soliton cellular automata ) is not new and it was undertaken in a number of papers , see for example @xcite . in particular , in paper @xcite other hirota equation ( equivalent to the discrete sine - gordon equation @xcite ) is investigated in the context of finite fields .    in the paper",
    "we present general method of finding solutions of the hirota equation over finite fields by using algebro - geometric methods , standard in a complex domain in the soliton theory @xcite .",
    "we change however the field of definition of the underlying algebraic curves from the complex numbers to a finite field ( see also earlier algebro - geometric papers @xcite where such a possibility was considered ) .",
