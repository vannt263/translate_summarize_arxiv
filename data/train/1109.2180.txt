    "the qcd sum rules is a powerful theoretical tool in studying the ground state hadrons both in the vacuum and in the nuclear matter , and has given many successful descriptions of the hadron properties , such as the masses , decay constants , form - factors , hadron coupling constants , etc @xcite .",
    "the properties of the light - flavor mesons and baryons in the nuclear matter have been studied extensively with the qcd sum rules @xcite , while the existing works on the heavy quarkonia and heavy baryons in the nuclear matter focus on the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the in - medium mass modifications of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 hadrons differ greatly from the corresponding ones of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 hadrons due to the appearance of the heavy quark , the full propagators of the heavy quarks in the nuclear matter undergo much slight modifications compared with that of the light quarks . the upcoming fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) project at gsi ( heavy ion research lab ) provides the opportunity to extend the experimental studies of the in - medium properties of the mesons and baryons into the charm sector @xcite , we can study the heavy hadrons in nuclear matter with the qcd sum rules and make predictions to be confronted with the experimental data of the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter ) and @xmath22 collaborations in the future .",
    "the scattering amplitude of one - gluon exchange can be rephrased into an antisymmetric antitriplet @xmath23 and an symmetric sextet @xmath24 in the color - space .",
    "the attractive interaction in the antisymmetric antitriplet favors the formation of the diquark states in the color antitriplet @xmath23 , the most stable diquark states , the @xmath25-type diquark states , maybe exist in the color antitriplet @xmath23 , flavor antitriplet @xmath26 and spin singlet @xmath27 channels due to fermi - dirac statistics @xcite , and the next stable diquark states , the @xmath0-type diquark states , maybe exist in the color antitriplet @xmath23 , flavor sextet @xmath28 and spin triplet @xmath29 channels @xcite . in the heavy quark limit , the heavy baryons can be classified as the @xmath25-type or @xmath0-type baryons according to the spin structures of the two light quarks @xcite . in ref.@xcite , we study the @xmath25-type heavy baryons @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the nuclear matter using the qcd sum rules , and obtain the in - medium positive mass - shifts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in this article , we extend our previous work to study the properties of the @xmath0-type heavy baryons @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the nuclear matter using the qcd sum rules .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we study the heavy baryons @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the nuclear matter with the qcd sum rules in sec.2 ; in sec.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sec.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",
    "we study the @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons in the nuclear matter with the following two - point correlation functions @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 where the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are color indexes , @xmath38 , the @xmath39 is the charge conjunction matrix , and the @xmath40 is the nuclear matter ground state .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath33 can be decomposed as @xmath41 according to lorentz covariance , parity and time reversal invariance @xcite . in the limit @xmath42 , the component @xmath43 reduces to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "we insert a complete set of intermediate heavy baryon states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath46 into the correlation functions @xmath47 to obtain the hadronic representation @xcite , then isolate the ground state @xmath32 baryon contributions , and resort to the dispersion relation to rephrase the three components of the correlation functions @xmath44 in the following form : @xmath48 where @xmath49\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta\\pi_q(\\omega,\\vec{q})&=&-2\\pi i\\frac{\\lambda_{\\sigma_q}^{*2 } } { 2e^*_q}\\left[\\delta(\\omega - e_q ) -\\delta(\\omega-\\bar{e}_q)\\right]\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta\\pi_u(\\omega,\\vec{q})&=&+2\\pi i\\frac{\\lambda_{\\sigma_q}^{*2}\\sigma_v } { 2e^*_q}\\left[\\delta ( \\omega - e_q ) -\\delta(\\omega-\\bar{e}_q)\\right]\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the @xmath53 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses , vector self - energies and pole residues of the @xmath32 baryons respectively in the nuclear matter .",
    "we carry out the operator product expansion in the nuclear matter at the large space - like region @xmath54 , and obtain the spectral densities at the level of quark - gluon degrees of freedom , then take the limit @xmath42 , and write the three components @xmath44 in the following form @xcite : @xmath55 where the @xmath56 are the wilson coefficients , the @xmath57 , which are defined as @xmath58 , are the condensates in the nuclear matter and can be decomposed as @xmath59 at the low nuclear density , the @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the vacuum condensates and the nuclear matter induced condensates , respectively .",
    "the imaginary parts of the qcd spectral densities can be obtained through the formula @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "finally , we match the hadronic spectral densities with the qcd spectral densities , and multiply both sides with the weight function @xmath63 , perform the integral @xmath64 , @xmath65 to exclude the negative - energy pole contributions , and obtain the following three qcd sum rules : @xmath66+\\frac{1}{96\\pi^2}\\langle\\frac{\\alpha_sgg}{\\pi}\\rangle_{\\rho_n}\\left [ ( 4 - 5x ) + ( 1-x)\\widetilde{m}_q^2\\delta(s-\\widehat{e}_q^2)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{m_q^2}{144\\pi^2}\\langle\\frac{\\alpha_sgg}{\\pi}\\rangle_{\\rho_n}\\frac{(1-x)^3}{x^2}\\left ( 1+\\frac{\\widetilde{m}_q^2}{2m^2}\\right)\\delta(s-\\widehat{e}_q^2)+\\bar{e}_q\\left [   \\frac{x(1-x)\\langle q^\\dagger q\\rangle_{\\rho_n}}{2\\pi^2 }",

    "@xcite , there are two criteria ( pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion ) for choosing the borel parameter @xmath100 and threshold parameter @xmath101 .",
    "we impose the two criteria on the heavy baryon states @xmath32 , and choose the threshold parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the borel parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the heavy baryons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "finally we obtain the values of the masses and pole resides @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 from the qcd sum rules with respect to the spinor structures @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the experimental values of the masses are @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 from the particle data group @xcite , the average values are @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively , which are consistent with the new experimental data from the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "the predicted masses from both spinor structures @xmath114 and @xmath115 can reproduce the experimental data approximatively , however , the pole residues from the spinor structures @xmath114 and @xmath115 differ from each other greatly , i.e. the values have the hierarchy @xmath123 , where the upper indexes denote the spinor structures .",
    "we can draw the conclusion that the two qcd sum rules in eqs.(7 - 8 ) in the limit @xmath95 can be satisfied by the approximate equal masses but unequal pole residues . if we obtain the masses @xmath99 by dividing eq.(8 ) with eq.(7 ) in the limit @xmath95 , the predictions @xmath124 and @xmath125 are much smaller than the experimental data due to the unequal pole residues .",
    "we can multiply the smaller masses by some coefficients to offset the effects of the unequal pole residues and reproduce the experimental data .",
    "take the same borel parameters and threshold parameters as the qcd sum rules in the vacuum @xcite , we can obtain the hadronic parameters @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 from the three coupled qcd sum rules in eqs.(7 - 9 ) . in the limit @xmath132",
    ", we can obtain the values @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 . in calculations",
    ", we have taken the assumption that the pole residues @xmath5 in the qcd sum rules ( see eqs.(7 - 9 ) ) have the same values .",
    "in fact , those qcd sum rules can be satisfied with approximately the same in - medium masses @xmath76 and vector self - energies @xmath135 , but different pole residues @xmath5 , which can be denoted as @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 from the qcd sum rules in eqs.(7 - 9 ) respectively .",
    "we draw this conclusion tentatively based on the qcd sum rules for the heavy baryon states in the vacuum @xcite , and normalize the masses from the qcd sum rules in the vacuum to the experimental data to study the mass modifications in the nuclear matter , @xmath139 and obtain the central values @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the @xmath140 are the scalar self - energies @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath32 baryons have a heavy quark besides two light quarks , the heavy quark interacts with the nuclear matter through the exchange of the intermediate gluons , the contributions from the gluon condensates are of minor importance and the modifications of the gluon condensates in the nuclear matter are mild , we expect the ratios of the mass - shifts @xmath142 are smaller than that of the nucleons . from fig.1 , we can obtain the mass differences @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , the uncertainties of the mass differences originate from the borel parameters are about @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "the ratios are @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the mass modifications are rather small .",
    "if we take into account the uncertainties of the heavy quark masses and threshold parameters , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 @xcite , the values of the mass differences @xmath154 survive approximately , no additional uncertainties are introduced . at the interval @xmath155",
    ", the masses @xmath76 decrease monotonously with the increase of the parameter @xmath156 , the uncertainty @xmath157 leads to the uncertainties @xmath158 and @xmath159 for the masses @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively in the nuclear matter , and the corresponding uncertainties for the mass - shifts @xmath162 and @xmath163 are @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "if we take the ioffe current to interpolate the proton , the qcd sum rules indicate that there exists a positive vector self - energy @xmath166 with the typical values of the relevant condensates and other input parameters , which is consistent with the values of the vector self - energies in the relativistic nuclear physics phenomenology , on the other hand , although the scalar self - energy depends strongly on the in - medium four - quark condensate and the nucleon @xmath167 term , a reasonable negative scalar self - energy can be obtained with the suitable parameters @xcite .",
    "there exists significant cancelation between the scalar and vector self - energies , which leads to a quasinucleon energy close to the free - space nucleon mass and satisfies the empirical expectation that the quasinucleon energy is shifted only slightly in nuclear matter relative to the free - space mass .",
    "the in - medium self - energies @xmath168 and @xmath169 can be written as @xmath170 in the leading order approximation , @xmath171 , which indicates a substantial cancelation between self - energies @xmath168 and @xmath169 in the nuclear matter .",
    "the mean - field models predicate that the typical self - energies of the nucleons in nuclear matter saturation density are @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively , which correspond to the real energy - independent optical potentials @xmath174 and @xmath175 , and significant cancelation between the potentials occurs , the effective non - relativistic central potential is about tens of @xmath176 .",
    "if the same mechanism works for the @xmath1 baryon , the vector self - energy should be @xmath177 rather than @xmath178 according to the unequal pole residues @xmath179 , the total self - energy @xmath180 under the condition @xmath181 , then the quasi-@xmath1 energy in the nuclear matter close to the free - space @xmath1 mass .",
    "the present prediction of the mass - shift @xmath6 can be confronted with the experimental data from the cbm and @xmath22 collaborations in the future @xcite , where the properties of the charmed baryons in the nuclear matter will be studied .    in the non - relativistic harmonic - oscillator potential model ,",
    "the spectrum of the bound states ( the energies @xmath182 and the wave - functions @xmath183 ) and the exact correlation functions are known precisely . in ref.@xcite , lucha , melikhov and simula try to fit the effective threshold parameter so as to reproduce both the ground energy @xmath184 and the pole residue @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) , or reproduce the ground energy @xmath184 only and take the pole residue @xmath185 as a calculated parameter .",
    "they observe that the pole residue @xmath185 is determined to a great extent by the continuum contributions , and draw the conclusion that the ground - state parameters extracted from the qcd sum rules have uncontrolled systematic errors if the continuum contributions are not known exactly and modeled by an effective continuum . in the real qcd world , the hadronic spectral densities are not known exactly , the pole residues or decay constants in some ( or most ) cases are not experimentally measurable quantities , and should be calculated by some theoretical approaches , the true values are difficult to obtain . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronic spectrum densities in the non - relativistic harmonic - oscillator potential model are of the dirac @xmath187 function type even in the limit @xmath188 , while in the case of the qcd , the widths of the higher radial excited states become broader gradually before submerging into the asymptotic quarks and gluons .",
    "for example , the widths of the @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 are @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath192 respectively , and the widths of the @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath192 are @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath192 respectively @xcite .",
    "we can not estimate the unknown systematic uncertainties of the qcd sum rules before the spectral densities in both the qcd and phenomenological sides are known with great accuracy . in the present case ,",
    "the situation is even worse , the theoretical works on the @xmath32 baryons in the nuclear matter are rare , and no experimental data exist .    , the ( a ) and ( b ) denote the @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons , respectively . , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , the ( a ) and ( b ) denote the @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons , respectively . ,",
    "in this article , we extend our previous work on the @xmath25-type heavy baryons @xmath202 to study the properties of the @xmath0-type heavy baryons @xmath32 in the nuclear matter using the qcd sum rules , and derive three coupled qcd sum rules for the masses @xmath3 , vector self - energies @xmath4 and pole residues @xmath5 in the nuclear matter , then obtain the values @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 . in the limit @xmath95 , the predictions @xmath124 and @xmath125 are much smaller than the experimental data due to the unequal pole residues from different spinor structures @xmath203 and @xmath115 .",
