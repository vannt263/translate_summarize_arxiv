    "type  ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are used to measure cosmological parameters and study the nature of the dark energy ( see leibundgut  2008 , and references therein ) . thanks to the uniformity of their peak luminosities , once a phenomenological relation between the light - curve shape and the peak luminosity is applied ( hereafter the light - curve correction , or the phillips relation ) , they can be accurately used as cosmological standard candles ( phillips  1993 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ; phillips et al .  1999 ) .",
    "their colors are also known to correlate with light - curve shape ( tripp 1998 ; tripp & branch 1999 ; phillips et al .",
    "in addition to light - curve shape and color , several other observables , mostly related to spectral features , have been shown to correlate with the sn peak luminosity ( e.g. , nugent et al .",
    "1995 ; mazzali et al .  1998 ; benetti et al .  2005 ; bongard et al .  2006 ; hachinger et al .  2006 ; foley et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "currently there are several issues yet to be clarified .",
    "one central issue is that the intrinsic color variations of sne  ia have not yet been fully understood .",
    "after application of the relation between color and light curve shape , there remain variations in the color excess of sne ia .",
    "so far , it has been practically impossible to discriminate between the contributions from a possible ` residual ' intrinsic color , which does not correlate with the light curve shape , and that from the extinction within the host or the environment around the sn .",
    "this issue could be related to the fact that when the dispersion of the hubble diagram is minimized with @xmath6 being treated as a free parameter , one obtains low values of @xmath6 between @xmath7 . however , as shown by folatelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ; hereafter f10 ) , when one compares the colors or color excesses of normal sne  ia , a more typical milky way - like value of the reddening law is obtained , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "f10 argued that this apparent discrepancy suggests that there is an intrinsic color variation within sne  ia that correlates with luminosity , but is independent of the light curve decline - rate @xmath9 ( b ) . in the present study",
    ", we adopt an @xmath6 @xmath10 as derived from f10 ( i.e. calibration 7 of table  9 ) .",
    "moreover , after application of the light - curve correction , hubble diagram residuals at the level of @xmath0 mag exist for individual sne  ia ( e.g. , phillips et al .",
    "1999 ; prieto et al .  2006 ; jha et al .  2007 ; hicken et al .",
    "this is one of the issues that presently limit the precision in using sne  ia to constrain the value of the equation - of - state parameter of the dark energy ( e.g. , hicken et al .",
    "2009b ; see also wood - vasey et al .",
    "2007 , kessler et al .",
    "2009 for the current status of the precision in sn  ia cosmology ) .",
    "several suggestions have been made for a secondary parameter that may provide a more accurate luminosity calibration ( or on parameters already including the effect of the second parameter ) .",
    "suggestions include ( i ) metallicity ( gallagher et al .",
    "2005 ; timmes et al . 2003 ; mazzali & podsiadlowski 2006 ; hflich et al .",
    "2010 , but see also howell et al .",
    "2009 ; neill et al .  2009 ;",
    "yasuda & fukugita  2010 ) , ( ii ) high - velocity spectral features ( wang et al .",
    "2009b ) , ( iii ) spectral flux ratios ( bailey et al .  2009",
    "; yu et al .  2009 ) , and ( iv ) the mass and/or the morphological type of the host galaxy ( kelly et al .",
    "2010 ; lampeitl et al .",
    "2010 ; sullivan et al . 2010 ) .",
    "an interesting possibility for the origin of the diverse properties of sne ia was recently suggested by kasen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) theoretically and by maeda et al .",
    "( 2010ab , hereafter m10a and m10b ) observationally , namely an asymmetry in the sn explosion combined with the observer viewing angle . in particular",
    ", m10a identified potential signatures of asymmetry in a number of sne ia , based on the observed wavelength shift of late - time emission lines ( see  2 for more details ) .",
    "m10ab showed that the required configuration is qualitatively consistent with the expectation from a deflagration - to - detonation transition scenario if the first thermonuclear sparks are ignited offset from the centre of the progenitor white dwarf .",
    "m10b suggested that the viewing angle effect is a probable origin of the spectral evolution diversity of sne ia .",
    "different sne  ia show different velocity gradients ( @xmath11 ) , defined as the speed of the decrease in the si ii absorption velocity after maximum brightness ( benetti et al .",
    "2005 ; see also branch et al .",
    "sne are divided into high - velocity - gradient ( hvg ) ( @xmath12 km s@xmath13 ) and low - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) objects ( @xmath14 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "m10b argued that different velocity gradients are a consequence of different viewing directions from which the sn is observed .",
    "it has been indicated that lvg and hvg sne may show different properties in their intrinsic colors ( e.g. , pignata et al .",
    "2008 ) and that their luminosities may have to be calibrated in a different manner ( wang et al .",
    "2009b ) . here",
    "we revisit this color issue in the context of our new interpretation of lvg and hvg sne .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore whether the late - time emission line shift , and thereby the observer viewing angle on an asymmetric explosion , is related to the intrinsic color and the luminosity residuals of sne  ia after application of the phillips relation .",
    "we find a correlation between the color at maximum brightness and the nebular emission line shift .",
    "we also investigate a possible relation between the luminosity residuals and the nebular line shifts , but since our sample is small the significance is not overwhelming .",
    "we then investigate the ramification of the viewing angle on the luminosity and color calibrations with the help of multi - dimensional radiation transfer calculations , and find that the predicted effect is qualitatively consistent with the trends seen in the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we summarize the findings of m10a regarding the asymmetry in sne  ia , which are then used throughout the present paper . in  3 , we present details of the sample of nearby sne  ia considered in this study . in  4 , we discuss how the viewing angle is related to the intrinsic color of sne  ia . in  5 , we discuss the procedures to estimate the intrinsic absolute magnitude and subsequent residuals . in  6 , we compare the late - time emission line shifts with the luminosity residuals . in  7",
    ", we investigate the effect of the viewing angle on the peak brightness and color by simulating light curves for kinematic off - centre toy models . in  8",
    "the paper is closed with conclusions , discussion and future perspectives .",
    "+             in this section , we summarize the findings presented in m10a regarding asymmetry in sne ia .",
    "m10a suggested that the innermost region of the ejecta , filled with stable fe - peak elements , is generally offset , and that an observer s viewing angle can be traced by shifts in the central wavelengths of nebular emission lines of [ fe ii ]  @xmath157155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath157378 at late phases .",
    "the argument is as follows :    1 .",
    "using a sample of late - time ( i.e. , at least 100 days after maximum brightness ) sn  ia spectra , mostly drawn from the suspect database , m10a found that in cases where the [ fe ii ]  @xmath16 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath157378 lines were detected , they exhibited measurable shifts in their central wavelength with respect to the expected rest wavelength , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . there is no clear correlation between the phase of the nebular spectrum and the shift of the [ fe ii ]  @xmath157155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath157378 lines .",
    "in addition , no significant evolution is seen in the measured line shifts for individual sne  ia at @xmath1 days . to illustrate these characteristics",
    ", we show the wavelength shifts ( converted to a velocity ) of these lines in fig .  2 . 2 .",
    "on the other hand , the strongest lines at late phases , i.e. , the [ fe iii ] blend at @xmath17    and the [ fe ii]/[fe iii ] blend at @xmath18   , behave similarly for all sne  ia .",
    "since the [ fe iii ] blend at @xmath17    is stronger and its blended nature can be better handled ( m10a ) , we show its temporal evolution in fig .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the phase the nebular spectrum and the central wavelength of the [ fe iii ] blend at 4700   , unlike for [ fe ii ]  @xmath157155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath157378 .",
    "the shifts of [ fe iii ] at @xmath19    evolve from the blue to the rest wavelength for all sne .",
    "the temporal behavior seen in figure 2 suggests that the shifts of [ fe ii ]  @xmath157155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath20 trace the line - of - sight velocity of the emitting material . as a consequence",
    ", the diversity in the wavelength shifts indicates that the distribution of the emitting material is offset with respect to the centre of the sn ejecta .",
    "note that spherically symmetric explosions with different expansion velocities should produce different line widths , but never a shift in the central wavelength . as a result of the offset ,",
    "the observed diversity arises from different observer viewing angles . on the contrary , the observed features of the [ fe iii ] blend at 4700     suggest that the [ fe iii ] blend traces the distribution of the emitting material only at sufficiently late epochs , and the small diversity indicates that the emitting material is distributed more or less spherically .",
    "m10a argued that these characteristics can be naturally explained by a deflagration - to - detonation explosion scenario , if the distribution of the inner deflagration ash has an offset and the outer detonation ash is distributed in a roughly spherically symmetric way .",
    "they proposed that these lines are emitted from different regions  an outer , relatively low - density region dominated by radioactive @xmath21ni ( which decays into @xmath21co and then into @xmath21fe , powering the sn light curve ) , and an inner , relatively high - density region dominated by stable fe - peak elements , i.e. , @xmath22ni , @xmath21fe , and @xmath23fe ( see also mazzali et al .",
    "the former and latter correspond to the detonation and the deflagration ashes , respectively .",
    "for such a configuration , the outer region should be in a relatively high ionization state ( i.e. , doubly - ionized ) and at high temperature ( electron temperature @xmath24  k ) .",
    "on the other hand , the inner region should be in a low ionization state ( i.e. , singly - ionized ) and at low temperature ( @xmath25  k ) .",
    "this stems from ( a ) the ionization balance and ( b ) the thermal balance .",
    "namely , ( a ) @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the density of the @xmath28-th ionization state , @xmath29 is the radioactive energy input from the decay chain @xmath21ni @xmath30 @xmath21co @xmath30 @xmath21fe , and @xmath31 is the electron density .",
    "( b ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the excitation temperature of the line , and @xmath34 is the population of the lower level .",
    "the [ fe iii ] blend at @xmath19    is emitted by fe@xmath35 with high @xmath33 , and thus the outer region dominates the emission of this blend .",
    "this blend is thus attributed to emission from the detonation ash in the deflagration - to - detonation transition scenario .",
    "the opposite is true for [ fe ii ]  @xmath157155 and [ ni ii ]  @xmath157378 , and thus these lines are mostly emitted from the inner region , i.e. , the deflagration ash .",
    "combined with the phenomenologically derived distribution of material emitting these lines ( see above ) , this argues that the deflagration ash is located offset from the centre of the progenitor star , while the detonation ash is distributed spherically .",
    "although these arguments are based on a few lines in the optical wavelength regime , this interpretation predicts that , at late phases , the lines from high ionization states and/or with high excitation temperature should show virtually no shift , while those from low ionization states and/or with low excitation temperature show a wavelength shift depending on the viewing direction .",
    "m10a showed that this is the case for sn 2003hv , which has a well observed spectrum at late phases , covering spectral lines from the optical all the way to the mid - infrared ( ir ) ( motohara et al .",
    "2006 ; gerardy et al .  2007 ; leloudas et al .",
    "the size of the offset derived for sn 2003hv was found to be @xmath36 km  s@xmath13 ( m10a ) .",
    "note that this behavior in various lines from optical through mid - ir provides an additional argument against line blending and radiation transfer as a cause of the observed line shifts .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,^ , < , > , < \" , ]         as another test , we explore how our results are affected if we adopt the sts cepheid distances (  5 ) . for 4 sne ia with a cepheid distance available , there are also measurements by the sts group ( saha et al .",
    "we also change the sbf measurements to be consistent with the sts measurements .",
    "the sbf values used in the main text are calibrated with the kp cepheid distance zero - point . since the sts values are on average larger than the kp values by @xmath37 mag , we add @xmath38 mag for the sbf distances .",
    "table b2 lists the sts distances thus derived for sne ia . for",
    "sne ia missing in table b2 , the same distances as in table 1 are used .",
    "figure b2 shows the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 diagram with the sts distance scale . for 20 sne ia",
    ", we obtained a chance probability of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the slope of the linear fit is steeper than that derived with the kp distance scale , although they are consistent within the errors of the fits .",
    "the zero - point is displaced by @xmath43 mag , reflecting the difference between the sts and kp distance scales .",
    "another large uncertainty comes from the estimate of the extinction within the host galaxies . to check the uncertainty",
    ", we change the value of @xmath6 to @xmath44 , the standard value for galactic extinction .",
    "following  4 and f10 , @xmath6 for sn 2006x is left unchanged . while it has been argued that the typical galactic value is not necessarily applicable for the host galaxies of sne ia ( e.g. , folatelli et al .",
