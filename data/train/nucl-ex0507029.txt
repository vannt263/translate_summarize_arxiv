    "among the challenges in nuclear physics today , is to understand the nuclear interaction for systems with an exotic composition of neutrons and protons ( which may occur in the @xmath7-process of nucleosynthesis and in neutron stars ) .",
    "one of the topics in this challenge is to understand the isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , and in particular its density dependence @xcite . in this difficult task",
    "many observables are needed to put as many constraints as possible on the nuclear interaction . among several suggested observables , @xcite ,",
    "the two - nucleon correlation function has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "experimentally , isospin effects in two - particle correlation functions were investigated by our group in ref .",
    "the experimental data were from e / a  =  61  mev @xmath0ar - induced semi - peripheral collisions on isotope - separated @xmath1sn targets .",
    "stronger @xmath8 correlations were found for the ar + @xmath9sn system , pointing to a shorter neutron emission time from the more neutron - rich system .",
    "smaller isospin effects were seen also in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 correlation functions @xcite .",
    "in addition , a study of the emission time sequence of neutrons , protons , and deuterons from the same reactions was carried out by our group in ref .",
    "@xcite , utilizing the method of the velocity - gated correlation functions .",
    "that investigation revealed a sensitivity of the particle emission time sequence to the isospin content of the emitting source , particularly for intermediate velocity source emission and emission from the target residues .",
    "in this paper we present complementary information to that of refs .",
    "@xcite , from the same experimental data set , focusing on deuterons and tritons .",
    "indeed , also light cluster production is expected to be a sensitive probe for the isospin dependence of the eos . in the theoretical investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( where ibuu was coupled with a coalescence model for cluster production ) , it was found that the nuclear symmetry energy significantly affects the production of light clusters in heavy ion collisions .",
    "more deuterons and tritons are produced with a stiff nuclear symmetry energy than with a soft .",
    "this is because the stiff symmetry energy induces a stronger pressure in the reaction system , and thus causes an earlier emission of neutrons and protons leading to stronger correlations among nucleons , and , consequently , larger yields of deuterons and tritons .",
    "the experiment was performed at kvi ( groningen ) . the interferometer consisted of 16 csi(tl ) detectors for light charged particles , mounted in the angular range 30@xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 114@xmath13 , and 32 liquid scintillator neutron detectors , mounted behind the `` holes '' of the csi array , in matching positions to provide the @xmath8 interferometer @xcite .",
    "energy thresholds for protons , deuterons , and tritons in the csi(tl ) detectors were 8 , 11 , and 14  mev respectively .",
    "details about the experimental setup and the particle energy determination are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from our previous analyses",
    "@xcite , including the source analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have confirmed that the emission of light particles from 61 a mev ( semi - peripheral ) heavy ion reactions originates from ( at least ) three sources : projectile and target residue evaporative sources ( statistical evaporation ) and intermediate velocity source .",
    "the intermediate source represents dynamical emission , which is described either by early nucleon - nucleon collisions or by other pre - equilibrium processes @xcite . within the multi - source reaction mechanism described above , composite particles , like deuterons and tritons ,",
    "are believed to be predominantly emitted from the dynamical emission source @xcite , where they are formed by a coalescence mechanism @xcite .",
    "figure [ yields ] compares the kinetic energy distributions of deuterons and tritons measured in @xmath0ar+@xmath16sn and @xmath0ar+@xmath9sn collisions .",
    "one can notice that the yields of the deuteron spectra are the same for the two sn - targets , while the triton yield from the more neutron - rich @xmath0ar+@xmath9sn system is enhanced ( by a factor 1.1 to 1.5 ) over the whole angular and energy range considered .    to further investigate the deuteron and triton production , we present the two - particle correlation functions involving deuterons and tritons . the correlation function , @xmath17 = @xmath18 / @xmath19 ,",
    "is generated by dividing the coincidence yield ( @xmath20 ) by the yield of non - correlated events ( @xmath21 ) constructed from the product of the singles distributions @xcite .",
    "the relative momentum is , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reduced mass , and the total momentum is , @xmath24 .",
    "the correlation function is normalized to unity at large values of @xmath25 , ( 200 @xmath3 @xmath25 @xmath3 300",
    "mev / c for all particle pairs ) where no correlations are expected .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath8 , and @xmath26 correlation functions have already been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those analyses , particles emitted by the intermediate velocity source were enhanced by selecting high- and intermediate-@xmath27 pairs , while particles emitted by the target residues were enhanced by selecting low-@xmath27 pairs in the target frame .",
    "further selection of different sources was obtained by applying angular gates .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath8 correlation functions were found to be very sensitive to the applied gates , indicating that both neutrons and protons are emitted from several sources .",
    "in contrast , deuterons and tritons mainly originate from common sources with a small spread in source velocity ( @xmath28 0.18 c ) @xcite . in agreement with those findings , we find , in the present work , that the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 correlation functions are quite insensitive to applying total - momentum and angular gates .",
    "we have therefore chosen to present angle and total - momentum - integrated @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 correlation functions in this paper .",
    "figure [ cfs](a , b ) compares the @xmath29 ( a ) and @xmath30 ( b ) correlation functions measured from the two sn - target systems .",
    "one can see that the coulomb hole dominates both correlations at low values of the relative momentum . for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the width of the coulomb hole is the same for the two sn - targets .",
    "this feature indicates that the average emission time of deuterons and tritons is the same for the two systems .",
    "the width of the coulomb hole is larger for @xmath29 than for @xmath30 , which is consistent with a larger average emission time for tritons than for deuterons .    the @xmath31 correlation function in fig .",
    "[ cfs]d is very similar for the two sn - targets .",
    "it is governed by strong resonances at @xmath25 @xmath32 10.8",
    "mev / c and @xmath25 @xmath32 83.5 mev / c , due to the excited states , @xmath33 = 16.75 mev ( @xmath34 = 0.076 mev ) and @xmath33 = 19.8 mev ( @xmath34 = 2.5 mev ) of @xmath35he @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the correlation functions involving also protons .",
    "the @xmath26 correlation function , that was presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , is characterized by a pronounced anti - correlation at small relative momenta , due to final state coulomb interaction .",
    "the anti - correlation is more pronounced for particle pairs selected by high- and intermediate - total - momentum gates , than for pairs selected by low - total - momentum gate .    the @xmath36 correlation function , shown in fig .",

    "the positions of the 1@xmath38 and 3@xmath39 resonances are marked by arrows .",
    "in contrast with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , the @xmath26 and @xmath36 correlation functions are sensitive to applying angle- and total - momentum gates .",
    "this is because protons are emitted from several sources @xcite . in order to consistently investigate emission from the intermediate velocity source",
    ", we have therefore applied a high - total - momentum gate to the @xmath36 correlation function ( shown in fig .",
    "[ cfs]c ) .",
    "this selection generates a correlation function characterized by stronger resonance peaks as compared to those obtained by lower total momentum gates .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ cfs]c reveals also a small difference in the correlation functions for the two sn isotopes .",
    "the more neutron - rich system leads to a slightly stronger resonance peak for the higher excited states of @xmath37he , while the opposite behavior is seen for the lowest excited state .",
    "further information about the emission times and chronologies can be obtained by means of particle - velocity - gated correlation functions of non - identical particles @xcite .",
    "this adds an important and novel piece of information to the picture of the reaction mechanism emerging from previous studies @xcite . for non - identical particles , @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we construct the correlation functions @xmath42 , gated on pairs with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , gated on pairs with @xmath45 .",
    "the particle velocities are calculated in the frame of the emitting source , and the same normalization constant , calculated from the ungated correlation function , is utilized for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite . if two particles @xmath40 and @xmath41 are emitted independently from a source , with @xmath40 later ( earlier ) than @xmath41 , then the ratio @xmath48 will show a peak ( dip ) in the region of @xmath25 where there is a correlation , and a dip ( peak ) in the region of @xmath25 where there is an anti - correlation .    to correctly interpret the experimental results , it is important to realize that the resonance peaks may a priori have two different origins",
    "@xcite :    1 .   from processes where an unstable fragment formed in the reaction decays into two particles which are measured in coincidence ( e.g.  @xmath35he @xmath49 @xmath50 + @xmath51 ) .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation in the decay determines the location of the resonance peak .",
    "2 .   from final state interactions between particles emitted independently from a source ( e.g.  intermediate velocity source , target and projectile residues ) .    if the two particles are emitted independently , the velocity - gated correlation functions contain information on the time sequence , but this is not the case if the two particles originate from the two - body decay of an unstable fragment emitted in the reaction . in the latter case ,",
    "the two particle velocities are determined by momentum conservation , and in the rest system of the decaying fragment , the lightest particle will always get the highest velocity . in this case , the velocity - gated correlation function obtained with the condition that the lightest particle has the largest velocity , should exhibit the strongest correlation or anti - correlation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "when we in some cases observe the opposite behavior ( namely that the gate , where the _ heaviest _ particle has the largest velocity , leads to a stronger correlation or anti - correlation ) we can reliably conclude that this behavior is dominated by a mechanism other than two - body decay .",
    "we attribute this effect to the interaction of independently emitted particles , and in this case , we use the velocity - gated correlation function to obtain information on the time sequence of the independently emitted particles .",
    "the study of the particle - velocity - gated @xmath26 correlation function can be found in ref .",
    "the extracted emission time sequence is that deuterons are , on average , emitted earlier than protons for both sn - target systems ( consistent with the findings of previous experimental investigations @xcite ) .",
    "note that this result refers to the average emission time , and it does not exclude that prompt protons are emitted before any deuteron is emitted .    the particle - velocity - gated @xmath52@xmath51 correlation function",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "this indicates that the behavior of the @xmath52@xmath51 correlation function in this region is dominated by independently emitted pairs .",
    "the emission chronology that can be deduced from this region is that protons are emitted earlier than tritons .",

    "the behavior of the @xmath59 ratio ( fig .",
    "[ led]f , h ) is therefore of delicate interpretation , since it may be dominated by the two - body resonance decays of @xmath35he , and it does not led itself to deduce the emission chronology in this case .",
