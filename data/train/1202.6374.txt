    "<S> at low temperatures , weakly coupled spin chains develop a magnetic order that reflects the character of gapless spin fluctuations along the chains . using nuclear magnetic resonance , we identify and characterize two ordered states in the gapless region of the antiferromagnetic , ising - like spin - chain system baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , both arising from the incommensurate fluctuations along the chains . </S>",

    "<S> spin - chain systems can thus be used as tunable simulators of frustrated planar magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1 , # 1 # 1 # 1#1    the study of important models in condensed - matter physics increasingly relies on the concept of quantum simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is largely associated with the gases of cold atoms , whose well - defined and highly tunable hamiltonians can be mapped onto many model hamiltonians of interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cold atoms in optical lattices allowed the first simulation of the quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator  @xcite , and , recently , also the simulation of ordered magnetic states on a lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> scarce difficulties with cold atoms , related to the fact that they are gases , are absent in quantum antiferromagnets , which also feature well - defined hamiltonians . among them , those that contain dimers of quantum spins can host bosonic excitations . as the density of bosons </S>",

    "<S> we show that if we map the configuration of spins in each chain onto a classical spin , the two ordered states correspond to the columnar and ferromagnetic ordered states of the frustrated @xmath2-@xmath3 spin model on a square lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the effective exchange coupling @xmath2 between the nearest - neighboring ( nn ) chains ( i.e. , classical spins ) can be continuously tuned by the applied magnetic field from _ ferromagnetic _ to _ antiferromagnetic _ , and we extract this field dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath2 with respect to a fixed exchange coupling @xmath3 between the next - nearest - neighboring ( nnn ) chains ( i.e. , classical spins ) then selects the most favorable ordered state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a mechanism for the transition between the two ordered states at @xmath6 . from the practical point of view , the exchange coupling scheme encountered in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 allows a simple _ quantitative _ control of the exchange interaction between the effective classical spins , extending the simulation possibilities of quantum antiferromagnets to the domain of planar magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> this is all the more valuable as a direct control of exchange interactions in known materials , by changing the applied pressure  @xcite or the chemical composition  @xcite , is only _ </S>",
    "<S> qualitative_.    we start by explaining the principle of the tuning mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on two ingredients : ( i ) chains hosting a type of spin fluctuations that can be manipulated by the magnetic field , and ( ii ) a frustrated interaction between pairs of chains . </S>",
    "<S> the tuning mechanism applies to chains formed by @xmath7 spins that are coupled by an anisotropic , ising - like antiferromagnetic exchange interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic field points along the exchange - anisotropy axis @xmath8 , a single chain exhibits gapless spin fluctuations in a certain field range , thus realizing a tll  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this range , i.e. , between the critical fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 , a uniform magnetization @xmath11 per spin induced by the field @xmath12 grows monotonously with @xmath12 from @xmath13 to the saturated value of @xmath14 . in the lower part of this range , </S>",
    "<S> gapless fluctuations are longitudinal ( i.e. , they involve spin components along the field ) and appear at the field - dependent ic wavevector @xmath15 $ ] along the chain  @xcite . mapping the spin chain onto a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of spinless fermions using the jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this equation simply relates the filling of the fermion band @xmath16 with the wavevector @xmath17 connecting both points of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> gapless fluctuations prevent an isolated chain from ordering even at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , in weakly coupled chains , a 3d magnetic order develops at low enough temperatures , whose type reflects the character of fluctuations : spins develop an ordered component along the field ( on top of the uniform @xmath11 ) in the form of spin - density waves ( sdws ) with an ic wavevector @xmath18 along the chains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main point here is that the wavevector of sdws is controlled by the field , varying from @xmath19 to @xmath13 between the critical fields . </S>",
    "<S> this is our first ingredient .     </S>",
    "<S> couplings in the zigzag scheme sums up to the effective coupling @xmath20 given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) @xmath20 based on the numerically calculated @xmath21 for exchange anisotropy @xmath22 in the range between the critical fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> sdws are mapped onto the classical spins ( arrows ) that assume a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) arrangement for a negative ( positive ) @xmath20 . ]    to make the energy of the exchange - coupled sdws depend on their wavevector , and hence on the magnetic field , pairs of sdws should interact in a frustrated manner . </S>",
    "<S> this is our second ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in the case of a non - frustrated interaction based on the couplings @xmath2 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ] , the energy of the coupled pair of sdws is proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are their phases . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , for the simplest case of a frustrated interaction based on a zigzag scheme with the couplings @xmath26 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ] , the coupling energy is proportional to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the wavevector - dependent @xmath28 factor simply reflects a one - site offset between the coupled sites in the respective chains . a comparison of the cases displayed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) shows that each frustrated pair of @xmath26 couplings sums up to the field - dependent effective coupling @xmath29.\\ ] ] furthermore , due to the @xmath30 factor the energy of the coupled sdws adopts the standard form of the coupling energy between the classical planar spins with orientations @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the phases of sdws thus encode the orientations of the effective classical spins interacting with the coupling @xmath20 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_j1s ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling can be tuned continuously by the field @xmath12 in the range between the critical fields , where it even changes sign [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) ] , which is an unexpected feature . </S>",
    "<S> although the individual interchain couplings @xmath26 are antiferromagnetic , @xmath20 can be tuned from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the effective classical spins flip from a parallel to an antiparallel arrangement [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) ] , implying that the original sdws switch from being in phase to being in opposite phase .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that such a tuning mechanism is realized in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 , which contains parallel chains of magnetic co@xmath31 ions , each carrying an effective anisotropic @xmath7 spin  @xcite . </S>",

[ fig2](g ) is generic , while the precise values depend on @xmath36 , @xmath40 and @xmath38 .        </S>",

    "<S> nn spins in this model interact with the tunable coupling @xmath20 and nnn spins with the field - independent coupling @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these two couplings compete to determine the most favorable spin arrangement . </S>",

    "<S> finally , as we are free to tune @xmath20 in accordance with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) , covering all three ground states , we are in possession of a simulator of frustrated magnetism on a square lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> v nmr spectra of various states ( for selected field and temperature values ) are recorded in a field parallel to @xmath32 after different durations of @xmath51 relaxation ( given ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) in the tll state the spectrum exhibits a single peak . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) in the columnar sdw state , the unrelaxed spectrum is reproduced by two characteristic u - shaped components of the same area . </S>",
    "<S> they are generated by two sets of v sites , located in between the chains hosting sdws that are either in phase ( dashed line ) or in opposite phase ( dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath51 relaxation preserves the shape of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) in the ferromagnetic sdw state , the unrelaxed spectrum is reproduced by a distribution of u - shaped components generated by a single set of v sites ( dashed line ) . a distribution based on the 2d sinusoidal modulation of the sdw amplitude in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane </S>",

    "<S> we check this picture experimentally by extracting the spin arrangement in various states from the corresponding @xmath53v nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectra  @xcite . at temperatures above the ordered states , throughout the tll state , the spectrum exhibits a single peak [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] generated by a single crystallographic v site located in between the nn chains [ figs .  [ fig2](a ) and ( c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry breaks at the transition to one of the ordered states , and the spectrum develops features . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the sinusoidal sdw breaks the translational symmetry along the chains and leads to the characteristic u - shaped spectrum  @xcite . between @xmath5  t and @xmath4  t , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum develops two u - shaped components [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ] , a fingerprint of the columnar sdw state . </S>",
    "<S> the components are generated by two sets of v sites arising from the broken symmetry between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 directions . above @xmath6 and </S>",
    "<S> up to at least @xmath54  t , the highest field in our experiment , the spectrum consists of a distribution of u - shaped components , which are revealed during the transverse ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) relaxation [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is generated by a single set of v sites , implying that the symmetry between @xmath33 and @xmath34 directions is restored . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that either the ferromagnetic or the checkerboard sdw state is realized above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> small linewidth of the spectrum is compatible with the ferromagnetic sdw state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is perfectly reproduced by a distribution that corresponds to the 2d sinusoidal modulation of the sdw amplitude in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the field dependence of @xmath2 is deduced from the measured shape of the phase boundary between the ordered sdw states and the tll state [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](j ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> transition temperatures in different fields are obtained from the temperature dependence of the @xmath53v longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates , @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the divergent behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath58 on increasing temperature @xmath59 is a signature of the second - order phase transition [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary changes the slope at exactly @xmath6 , on the border between the two sdw states . in the columnar sdw state , </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_enj1j2 ] ) yields the coupling energy @xmath60 , while in the ferromagnetic sdw state it is @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the average coupling of the chain to its neighbors in the two ordered sdw states is thus @xmath62 which is continuous at @xmath6 because @xmath63 . for weakly interacting chains , </S>",
    "<S> the interchain coupling @xmath64 can be treated in the mean - field approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this basically implies that the transition temperature scales as a field - dependent power of @xmath64 . using @xmath65 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_jp ] ) , the measured phase boundary is perfectly reproduced with the choice of @xmath20 plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) and the interchain coupling of @xmath66  mk ( @xmath67 is the boltzmann constant ) , which is indeed much smaller than the intrachain coupling of @xmath68  k  @xcite . whereas the field - independent @xmath65 below @xmath6 implies a negative slope of the boundary ( already known before our work  @xcite ) , the slope inversion above @xmath6 is due to @xmath65 starting to grow steeply enough with field due to an increasing @xmath69 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the mean - field expression for the transition temperature assumes a uniform sdw amplitude in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane , a perfect agreement with the experimental points suggests that the observed 2d amplitude modulation in the ferromagnetic sdw state is nearly uniform , i.e. , is long wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the extracted @xmath20 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) predicts the existence of the checkerboard sdw state above @xmath70  t , which remains to be studied in high - field experiments .        </S>",
    "<S> finally , we verify that the behavior of individual spin chains in the covered field range is indeed dominated by the longitudinal ic spin fluctuations , one of the ingredients for the concept of tunable interaction . </S>",
    "<S> gapless fluctuations are directly probed by @xmath55  @xcite . at @xmath71  k , in the tll state </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath55 data precisely follow the decreasing trend of the tll prediction for the longitudinal ic fluctuations [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are no traces of the transverse staggered fluctuations , which are expected to become important at higher fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary condition for the dominance of the longitudinal ic fluctuations is the anisotropy of the involved @xmath7 spins  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an effective description of this type indeed applies to co@xmath31 spins in trigonally distorted octahedral environments  @xcite , the case encountered in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> related co - based spin - chain systems show promise for use as simulators of frustrated magnetism in other planar geometries , such as triangular or kagome , hence allowing new insights into spin - liquid physics  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we identified a mechanism for the tunable exchange interaction between the nn spin chains in baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is responsible for the transition to a new ic ordered state that we discovered , and allows to regard baco@xmath0v@xmath0o@xmath1 as a tunable simulator of frustrated magnetism on a square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the novel phenomenon of tunable interaction emerges in the pairs of 1d objects dominated by tunable quantum fluctuations in the presence of frustration . </S>",
    "<S> it adds to the list of other emergent phenomena arising from particular types of spin fluctuations in frustrated spin systems , such as emergent gauge fields in classical spin ices or fractional particle excitations in quantum spin liquids  @xcite .    </S>",
