    "universalities play an important role in physics , because they point to fundamental laws and properties , such as symmetries , topology , scaling behavior , and others . moreover , when broken , they open a door to new physics . here",
    "we wish to consider one example that is important in the context of the present work .",
    "recently , following the suggestion of kane and fisher , @xcite experiments on shot noise in quantum hall systems@xcite directly measured fractional charge of laughlin quasiparticles .",
    "the interpretation of these experiments invokes a simple argument that weak quasiparticle tunneling is an uncorrelated poisson process which is described by the schottky formula @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average tunneling current , @xmath2 is the zero - frequency noise power of the tunneling current , and @xmath3 is the fractional charge of quasiparticles .",
    "more rigorously , the schottky formula follows from the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , which states that when a tunnel junction weakly connects two metallic reservoirs , the following relation generally holds@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electro - chemical potential difference applied to the barrier .",
    "this relation is a generalization of the well - known callen - welton fdt which connects the noise power and the linear response coefficient , @xcite and follows from the argument similar to the one used in the linear response theory .",
    "this implies the universality of the relation ( [ fdt ] ) , i.e.  it holds independently of the character of the interaction , spectrum of quasiparticles , the geometry of a tunnel junction , etc .",
    "it is easy to see that the callen - welton theorem and the schottky formula are the two limits of the relation ( [ fdt ] ) .",
    "here we present a simplified derivation of ( [ fdt ] ) , based on the `` golden rule''.@xcite quantum mechanical transition rate between to energy states @xmath6 and @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the matrix element of the tunneling amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "then the average current can be evaluated as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the diagonal matrix element of the density operator , i.e.  the probability to find the system in the state @xmath6 . when tunneling is weak , forward and backward tunneling transitions are independent poisson processes with the dispersions of fluctuations equal to mean currents .",
    "therefore , the total noise power is equal to @xmath13 .    , the detector consisting of a tunnel junction shunted by the load resistor , @xmath14 , and the capacitor @xmath15 . the voltage bias @xmath16 and @xmath17 is applied to the system and to the tunnel junction , respectively .",
    "fluctuating current through a mesoscopic system is accumulated on the capacitor and creates the fluctuating potential @xmath18 across the tunneling barrier.,width=226 ]    [ circuit ]    in equilibrium @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 , and the current vanishes .",
    "if the potential difference @xmath5 is applied between the leads which are locally at equilibrium , then the density matrix acquires the grand - canonical form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is number of electrons in one of the leads .",
    "since the tunneling amplitude changes the number of particles in this lead by one , then obviously one can write @xmath23 , which immediately gives the relation ( [ fdt ] ) .    from the derivation of the fdt it is obvious that non - equilibrium processes in reservoirs play a special role , since they may lead to a deviation from the universal relation ( [ fdt ] ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to investigate this phenomenon in the case when nonequilibrium processes take place in the electrical ( measurement ) circuit to which the tunnel junction is attached . in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] we draw its simplified version that contains essential parts : the mesoscopic system which creates non - equilibrium noise and has the conductance @xmath24 , the detector consisting of a tunnel junction shunted by the load resistor , @xmath14 , and the capacitor @xmath15 .",
    "one of the important results of our paper is that the fdt breaks down in a minimal way , so that some properties of the current - to - noise ratio , which contain an important information about non - equilibrium processes in the leads , retain their universality .",
    "this leads to the idea to use tunnel junctions as on - chip detectors of non - equilibrium noise , which we investigate below in details .",
    "the measurement circuit has been proven to play an important role in the physics of the noise detection with the standard measurement technique @xcite and with the help of on - chip noise detectors.@xcite it has been established that in the long time ( markovian ) limit the backaction of the measurement circuit on the system leads to `` cascade corrections '' to statistics of noise.@xcite in order to quantify the circuit effects one solves the kirhgoff ( the current conservation ) law for the fluctuations of the current through the mesoscopic system @xmath25 and through the load resistor @xmath26 , and the voltage fluctuations @xmath18 on the capacitor : @xmath27 . \\label{impedance1}\\ ] ] the circuit impedance is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the differential circuit resistance , and @xmath30 is the circuit response time .",
    "( [ impedance1 ] ) describes the effect of the system current fluctuations via the circuit on the tunnel junction which directly detects potential fluctuations . the normalized circuit resistance @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the conductance quantum , plays a role of the dimensionless coupling constant , which parametrizes the strength of the circuit effects .",
    "in the present work we assume that coupling is weak , @xmath33 .",
    "quantum noise detectors , the main operating principle of which is based on the resonant tunneling in a two - level system , where investigated experimentally and theoretically in a number of previous works .",
    "@xcite here we consider two different detectors of this type . the first one , the double - dot ( dd ) detector of quantum noise theoretically analyzed by aguado and kouwenhoven , @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ double - dot ] .",
    "it consists of two quantum dots , which are strongly coupled to leads and weakly coupled to each other . to the lowest order in inter - dot coupling",
    "the electron transport in the dd detector occurs via inelastic transitions between nearest energy levels of two dots .",
    "these transitions are assisted by the emission ( absorption ) of the energy @xmath34 to ( from ) the circuit , where @xmath34 is the inter - dot level distance .",
    "away from the resonance the average current through the dd detector is given by @xcite @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spectral density of the non - symmetrized correlator of the system current .",
    "it is easy to see that the parameter @xmath34 plays a role of the bandwidth of the detector .",
    "the operating principle of the second detector , based on the telegraph process ( tp detector , see fig .",
    "[ telegraph - process ] ) , is slightly different .",
    "it contains two weakly coupled quantum dots , which are electrically isolated from the circuit , but capacitively coupled to it .",
    "fluctuations of the potential on the capacitor , caused by the current noise in the mesoscopic system , lead to rare electron transitions between two dots which change the electrical charge of , say , the left dot randomly in time . when left dot interacts with a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc )",
    ", it randomly switches the qpc current between two levels , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , leading to the telegraph process .",
    "the average qpc ( detector ) current @xmath39 is a monotonic function of the inter - dot level distance @xmath34 , which changes from one current level to the other , depending on the average occupation of the left dot .",
    "thus the qpc acts as a sensitive electrometer of the occupation of the quantum dot , the principle demonstrated in early work [ ] and subsequently elaborated in recent experiments , where the real time detection of single - electron tunneling , @xcite the measurement of counting statistics , @xcite and the information backaction of a detector@xcite have also been shown .",
    "we denote with @xmath40 the current - to - noise ratio for the dd detector and call it the detector function .",
    "although @xmath41 depends on the bias voltage @xmath17 , we choose to represent it as a function of the energy @xmath42 of the electron - hole pair created in the leads by the elementary tunneling event .",
    "this energy parametrizes the asymmetry of the detector , because in case @xmath43 , or equivalently @xmath44 , there is no difference between left and right dot of the dd system . below we prove an important fact that the average current through the qpc of the tp detector , after a proper normalization [ see eqs .",
    "( [ id2 ] ) and ( [ id3 ] ) ] , is given by the symmetric detector function @xmath45 .",
    "when the circuit is at thermal equilibrium , @xmath46 according to the fdt .",
    "the physics of quantum noise detection is quite rich thanks to a number of energy scales that determine the dynamics of entire system . while these energy scales are not important in the case of equilibrium circuit , because the fdt holds and leads to the universality , they start to play an important role away from equilibrium .",
    "first of all , it is an effective temperature of the noise source , @xmath47 , which is formally defined by eq.([energy ] ) .",
    "it has a meaning of the energy provided by the system and the load .",
    "alternatively , one can think of the correlation time @xmath48 of the noise source .",
    "second important parameter is the detector bandwidth @xmath34 , introduced earlier .",
    "third , the circuit itself is characterized by the response time @xmath49 and corresponding energy scale @xmath50 ( we set @xmath51 ) .",
    "finally , the asymmetry of the dd detector is characterized by the energy @xmath52 .    in the weak coupling limit , which we consider throughout the paper , where the dimensionless circuit impedance @xmath53 is small",
    ", the detector operates at the _ gaussian point _",
    ", i.e.  the contribution of high order cumulants ( irreducible moments of noise ) is small .",
    "the physical reason for this is that in the limit @xmath33 the detector only weakly interacts with the the noise source , therefore it has to operate for a relatively long time interval of the order of @xmath54 in order to accumulate a sufficient information about the noise . during this time interval",
    "many fluctuations contribute to the detector signal , so that by virtue of the central limit theorem the resulting noise becomes gaussian . in sec .",
    "[ cumulant ] we show how the third cumulant , which is the simplest characteristics of the non - gaussianity , nevertheless can be extracted from the detector output signal .",

    "close to the resonance , @xmath56 , the interaction of the detector with the circuit becomes effectively strong , and inelastic transitions in the detector are assisted by multiple photon absorption and emission processes . as a result ,",

    "@xmath262 fluctuation dissipation relations may contain an information about the full distribution of the fluctuating potential .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the double dot system in the adiabatic regime , @xmath263 , may serve as a nonlinear element which generates an instability in the mesoscopic circuit .",
    "it then may be used as on - chip threshold detector of rare event in transport .",
    "the difficulty of this problem is that the dynamical coulomb blockade effect in this case is not generally negligible .    in the case of a tp detector",
    "the excitation of an electron - hole pair in the qpc may cause a transition in the dd system .",
    "this competing quasiparticle process reduces the precision of the detection of collective charge excitations in the measurement circuit .",
    "intuitively , one should keep the current through the qpc on a very low level .",
    "however , this will reduce the rate of the measurement .",
    "moreover , the quasiparticle process is interesting in itself and should be investigated theoretically .",
    "we think that the physics of double - dot systems described here is rather universal and should be same in various two - level systems of a different nature .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to consider other systems too .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to generalize present results to the case of a quantum detector with many levels with the energies @xmath264 , @xmath265 .",
    "there is a hope that such system will be able to detect high order correlators of current at finite frequencies equal to the energies @xmath264 .",
    "concerning specific results presented in the paper , two problems remain to be solved .",
    "first , we have shown that in the classical noise detection regime the effect of the second cumulant of the system current is universal , i.e.  it does not depend on the circuit details .",
    "on the contrary , the third cumulant contribution depends on the circuit response time and has been found here in the limit of fast and slow circuit .",
    "interesting problem , which may also be experimentally very relevant , is to find the third cumulant contribution including cascade correction for arbitrary circuit .",
    "second , the most dramatic effect of a non - equilibrium system noise on the detector function is that the exponential behavior ( [ fdt ] ) is replaced with the power law functions ( [ result1 ] ) and ( [ result1-dimless ] ) .",
    "thus the power law behavior is a signature of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "however , this our result has been obtained by considering a coherent non - interacting mesoscopic conductor as an example of the system .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to consider other systems in order to check the generality of our conclusion .                                                                                              in general , the phase @xmath137 is multiplied by a dimensionless number parameterizing the efficiency of screening by a circuit capacitor .",
    "this number merely renormalizes the coupling constant which does not affect the the detector function ."
