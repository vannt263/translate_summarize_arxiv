    "the @xmath0cdm  model  a universe dominated by cold dark matter and a cosmological constant  is a successful model of the universe at large scales @xcite . however , as more observations are made and computational power becomes available , discrepancies in the model have been found below galactic scales .",
    "cosmological simulations show that the dark matter halo of a milky - way - sized galaxy , in addition to having a smooth component with well - known density profiles @xcite , should be populated by substructures , or subhalos @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction has not been supported by observational evidence , as many efforts over the past two decades have failed to find enough satellite systems in the milky way to account for the predicted abundance @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is called the _ missing satellite problem_.    competing solutions to the missing satellite problem can be roughly classified into two types  astrophysical and physical .",
    "astrophysical solutions , on one hand , postulate that the predicted subhalo abundance is correct , but the subhalos have too little stellar content to be observable directly . for example , reionizing radiation or stellar feedback @xcite can suppress star formation in a subhalo . this class of solutions is founded on the absence of baryonic processes in those cosmological simulations which predicted the subhalo abundances . physical solutions , on the other hand , postulate that the predicted subhalo abundance is incorrect , as our understanding of cdm may be incomplete .",
    "alternative dark matter solutions , such as warm dark matter @xcite , self - interacting dark matter @xcite , or inflationary models with non - scale invariance @xcite offer mechanisms to suppress structure formation at small scales .",
    "clearly , the predicted difference between these two types of solutions is the number of subhalos . in order to test the @xmath0cdm  model at sub - galactic scales , measuring",
    "the true abundance of subhalos is an important step .",
    "tidal streams  or simply `` streams ''  are remnants of stellar systems such as globular clusters ( gcs ) or dwarf galaxies ( dgs ) as they are tidally disrupted by a massive host . when the stars become unbound from the progenitor , the stars trace an elongated tail which wraps around the massive host .",
    "tidal remnants have long been useful probes for studying the gravitational potential of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite first used simulations to show that the encounters between the stream stars and subhalos can dynamically heat up the stream , which can be used to probe the presence of subhalos .",
    "moreover , a key influence that subhalos have on streams is that the stream stars near the point of the encounter get scattered into different orbits by the perturbation , causing an abrupt decrease in stellar density in that region of an otherwise smooth stream . using the abundance of subhalos obtained from high - resolution simulations @xcite",
    ", it has been predicted that streams in the milky way described by the @xmath0cdm  model should contain many `` gaps '' @xcite .    in the past decade , many streams in the milky way have been found ( see @xcite for a list ) .",
    "two streams of particular interest to us are pal-5 @xcite and gd-1 @xcite .",
    "both streams are detected as long , narrow tidal tails with length - to - width ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "these two streams are interesting as they show varying densities longitudinally along the streams .",
    "it is not clear whether those density variations correspond to subhalo perturbations .",
    "other possible origins of those density variations include clumping due to the coherence in the epicyclic orbits of stream stars @xcite and jeans instabilities @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this study is to test whether the gaps observed in streams are consistent with the prediction by the @xmath0cdm  model . @xcite and",
    "@xcite independently made the first predictions by simulating ideal streams with massless particles in the presence of orbiting subhalos .",
    "in particular , @xcite derived analytical expressions of the gap formation rate as a function of a stream s intrinsic properties , which are readily comparable to observations .",
    "however , neither of the aforementioned studies self - consistently modeled the realistic disruption of the progenitor system .    in this study",
    ", we measure the gap formation rate by modeling a stream s formation and its interaction with subhalos using n - body simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the details of our simulations , including the subhalo abundances and density profiles that we adapt , and the details of the star cluster and the resulting model stream .",
    "section 3 focuses on the method of detecting gaps in a simulated stream .",
    "the method of using match filters is inspired by analyses for observations , but modified here to analyze simulations .",
    "section 4 contains detailed discussion of our key results , including the phenomenology of gaps and comparisons with previous analytical predictions and observations .",
    "section 5 is a summary of our results .",
    "the host galaxy is modeled as a dark matter halo , as well as a set of subhalos which orbit around the halo s potential .",
    "a milky - way - sized halo is modeled with a static spherical navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite with @xmath4 kms@xmath5  located at @xmath6 .",
    "each individual subhalo is modeled by a spherical hernquist profile @xcite @xmath7 for simplicity , compared to einasto profiles which produce better fits in simulations but are more complicated to compute @xcite .",
    "we use the formula found in @xcite , which approximates the results from both @xcite and @xcite , where @xmath8 is independent of galactocentric position , and is related to @xmath9 by @xmath10 we use the mass and spatial distributions of the subhalos from the results of the aquarius simulations @xcite , where the mass function is independent of the spatial distribution .",
    "the mass function is a power law @xmath11 and the spatial distribution follows an einasto profile @xmath12   \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the subhalos velocities are initialized with a gaussian distribution where the velocity dispersion is the solution to the isotropic jean s equation @xcite using the halo s potential . the subhalos orbit around this potential as test masses .",
    "the progenitor of the stream , which is an approximation to a globular star cluster , is initialized using @xmath13 particles of equal mass as a king model with parameters @xmath14 , total mass @xmath15 , and a core radius of @xmath16 kpc .",
    "this results in a zero - density radius of @xmath17 kpc .",
    "each n - body particle in the system interacts with the dark matter halo s and subhalos potentials . with the galactic center at the origin , the satellite is initially put at @xmath18 kpc and velocity @xmath19 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting orbit is confined on the @xmath20-plane with eccentricity @xmath21 , peri- and apogalacticon at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal and radial periods are about 0.70 gyr and 0.47 gyr , respectively .",
    "we use gadget-2 @xcite for our n - body simulations .",
    "since the public distribution does not have functionality for external potentials , we modify the code such that in every time step , an external acceleration term which accounts for the potentials of the halo and all the subhalos is added to the accelerations of all the particles after their n - body interactions are computed .",
    "each of our simulations lasts 10 gyr , and we impose a maximum time step of 1 myr .",
    "the particle softening is 5 pc .",
    "each simulation produces 500 snapshots , one every 20 myr , and each consists of the positions and velocities of the n - body particles and subhalos .",
    "the star cluster is modeled as an n - body system which forms a stream as the cluster is disrupted by the tidal field of the massive host . when the cluster is isolated , the energies of the individual particles are conserved to a few percent over 10 gyr . using the softening as minimal impact distance",
    ", the relaxation timescale in the core is @xmath24 , which is much greater than the orbital period at @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : massloss ] shows the mass enclosed inside 0.103 kpc of the star cluster s center it is orbiting in the absence of subhalos . because the stream is repeatedly stretched and compressed longitudinally along the eccentric orbit , the mass enclosed in a fixed radius is not always decreasing in time .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : massloss ] shows that the mass loss is driven purely by bulge shocking @xcite , as the periodic bursts have exactly the same period as the radial period of the orbit .",
    ".,width=336 ]    figure [ fig : stream_sigma_width ] shows the velocity dispersion and traverse fwhm of our simulated stream without any subhalos .",
    "the stream is chosen so that its properties are on the same orders of magnitude as pal-5 @xcite and gd-1 @xcite . in the derivation in @xcite ,",
    "the gap formation rate is expressed as a function of galactocentric distance of the orbit and width of the stream . for our simulated stream ,",
    "we adapt average values of 22 kpc and 0.3 kpc , respectively , over the entire stream .        in a time",
    "independent and spherical potential @xmath26 , three interesting conserved quantities are the radial , azimuthal , and latitudinal actions where @xmath27 respectively @xcite , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the apo- and pericentric distances of the orbit , respectively .",
    "since our stream s orbital plane is the @xmath20-plane , @xmath30 ( though not exactly 0 because the stream has a finite thickness ) , so we only consider @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore the progenitor and only consider the particles which have already escaped from the cluster , so when computing @xmath31 we assume that the potential due to the progenitor s potential is negligible .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are useful since their dispersions are the origins of the stream s average width .",
    "for example , in the epicyclic approximation @xcite where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the epicyclic frequency and amplitude , respectively , the radial motion can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary phase angle .",
    "then it can be shown that @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the orbital frequency and radius of the guiding center , respectively .",
    "clearly , dispersions in both @xmath34 and @xmath39 can affect the width of the stream .",
    "therefore , conserved quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are especially valuable in understanding the width of the stream .",
    "figure [ fig : jr_lz_distribution ] shows the distributions in @xmath40 when the stream is 8 gyr old .",
    "the two lobes at higher and lower @xmath32 are the trailing and leading branches of the stream , respectively .",
    "the absolute dispersions in @xmath31 and @xmath32 are on the same order of magnitude , in rough agreement with the formula @xmath41 @xcite . in section [ sec : gap_morphology ] , we will show how the spread in actions affects the morphology of stream gaps .",
    "plots similar to figure [ fig : jr_lz_distribution ] can be found in @xcite where they used angle - action variables extensively to study the relation between the stream and the orbit .",
    "a similar plot can also be found in @xcite , but in scaled energy and angular momentum which were first used by @xcite to describe the dynamics of tidal streams .     for our stream at 8 gyr without any subhalos .",
    "along the entire stream with the progenitor masked out , 50,000 unbound particles were randomly selected to be placed on this map .",
    "each pixel in this map represents the density of particles in that bin .",
    "the two symmetric lobes are the two branches of the stream .",
    "similar plots can be found in @xcite , and a plot in scaled energy and angular momentum in @xcite.,width=336 ]",
    "@xcite divided their subhalo mass spectrum into separate mass ranges in order to resolve the contributions from each mass range . using the same approach",
    ", we divide the subhalos from @xmath42 to @xmath43 into 13 mass ranges ( table [ table : subhalo_massrange ] ) .",
    "each mass range contains incrementally more subhalos , starting from the higher mass end toward the lower mass end . in the higher mass end",
    ", the mass ranges are chosen such that the increase in subhalo masses are roughly the same . in the lower mass end ,",
    "the mass ranges are chosen such that the increase in subhalo numbers are roughly the same .    in each set of subhalos",
    ", we reduce their numbers by eliminating those whose orbits are always inside the perigalacticon and outside the apogalacticon of the progenitor s orbit .",
    "the largest subhalo in our simulations has a length scale of @xmath44 ( equation ( [ eqn : subhalo_size ] ) ) , so all the subhalos with perigalacticon ( apogalacticon ) larger ( smaller ) than that of the progenitor s orbit by @xmath45 will interact minimally with the stream .",
    "this allows us to safely eliminate the subhalos with perigalacticon larger than @xmath46 , and apogalacticon smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "we run 14 simulations  1 `` smooth stream '' without any subhalos , and 13 `` @xmath0cdm  streams '' containing the subhalos in the mass ranges in table [ table : subhalo_massrange ]  with identical initial conditions and dark matter halo potential .",

    "one each for the leading and trailing streams  in polar coordinates centered at the galactic center .",
    "the points along each line are spaced at 0.002 radians apart . between each pair of",
    "adjacent points a cylinder of radius 1 kpc is drawn which lies lengthwise along the pair of points .",
    "the linear density is then the number of particles inside this cylinder divided by the length of the cylinder .",
    "this spacing is chosen so that the gaps as wide as the stream are well resolved .",
    "the method used to find gaps in stream densities is inspired by the technique first used by @xcite to find gaps in observations .",
    "they used matched filters of the estimated shape of a density gap at various length scales to look for positions in the stream which potentially contain gap signals .",
    "the filter consists of a local minimum which is the underdensity of stars , and two local maxima on both sides of the minimum due to conservation of mass ( figure [ fig : filter_scales ] ) .",
    "this method is similar to the wavelets approach , where the integral of the filter function is constructed to vanish inside a certain domain .",
    "the potential gap signals are then easily identified as local maxima in the convolution between the filter and the signal .    to obtain the significance of each potential gap signal against noise , @xcite produced bootstrap samples from the sky background . with the simulations in this study , we can estimate noise levels using the smooth stream . note that the `` smooth stream '' itself is not totally smooth . as we will show in section [ sec : gap_counting ] , there are large density fluctuations near the progenitor due to the coherent in epicyclic motion of the particles , as first explained by @xcite .",
    "when the particles become unbound from the progenitor , they pile up near the base of their cycloid trajectories , creating epicyclic overdensities ( hereafter eo ) along the stream . although this intrinsic process to mimic gaps can be confused with gaps caused by subhalos , eos are only apparent within @xmath79 away from the progenitor in our streams ( figures [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange0 ] and [ fig : density_gaps_central_massrange0 ] ) .",
    "the details of the dynamics of eos is beyond the scope of this study , but this effect can be understood in terms of orbital actions .",
    "eos occur due to coherent epicyclic motions of the particles , which nevertheless have finite dispersions in orbital actions ( figure [ fig : jr_lz_distribution ] ) and are not perfectly coherent .",
    "therefore , although the escaping particles orbits stay roughly coherent in the first few clumps , their orbits eventually drift out of phase as they travel along the stream .",
    "this explains why the density peaks of eos further downstream are not as apparent as the peaks closer to the progenitor @xcite .    after masking @xmath80 of the smooth stream centered at the progenitor ,",
    "the rest of the smooth stream is simply noise .",
    "our method to find gaps in a given stream can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "compute @xmath81\\ , f\\left ( \\frac{2(x - x^\\prime)}{s } \\right ) dx^\\prime          \\label{eqn : cs } \\ ] ] where @xmath82 is a matched filter function @xcite , and @xmath83 is the filter scale .",
    "@xmath84 is the mean of @xmath85 inside @xmath86 $ ] , the domain in which the integral of @xmath87 itself vanishes .",
    "each potential gap signal would appear as a local maximum in @xmath88 .",
    "this convolution is computed at 12 logarithmically spaced filter scales from 0.1 to @xmath2 ( figure [ fig : filter_scales ] ) , and then all the local maxima of each stream are sorted by @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   repeat the above step using the smooth stream , but with @xmath90 kpc from the progenitor masked along the stream .",
    "the set of local maxima in @xmath91 from this convolution is the noise , which are also sorted by @xmath92 .",
    "each local maximum in the signal set are compared against the noise set .",
    "a signal element at any position along either branch of the stream that ranks higher than 99% in the noise set is identified as a gap .",
    "inevitably , this method may detect the same gap at 99% confidence at different scales but in very close proximity . to avoid over - counting",
    ", we employ the following scheme to eliminate overlapping gaps .",
    "first , we define an overlap as two gaps whose @xmath89 local maxima are identified at @xmath93 and @xmath94 that are within @xmath95 away from each other along the stream , where @xmath96 .",
    "when this occurs , the gap with higher @xmath89 eliminates the lower .",
    "our gap detection method requires no prior knowledge whether a given gap is an eo or a subhalo perturbation , both of which can be identified as a series of over- and under - densities .",
    "when we count the number of gaps in the end , eos will be included .",
    "one key result of our study is that gaps due to eos are distributed very differently in lengths compared to gaps due to subhalo perturbation .    .",
    "with a physical scale @xmath83 , the integral of @xmath87 vanishes inside @xmath97 .",
    "the roots of each filter are located at @xmath98 so that the gap length is simply the distance between the roots .",
    "we search for gaps at 12 logarithmically filter scales from 0.1 to @xmath2 in order to minimize the chance of detecting the same gap at multiple scales.,width=336 ]",
    "according to @xcite , gaps in general are diagonal and not perpendicular to the stream due to a gradient in angular momentum ( hence a gradient in orbital velocities ) across the width of the stream , which can shear a gap longitudinally .",
    "figure [ fig : jr_lz_distribution ] allows us to estimate the shearing effect in our streams using the distributions in angular momenta . for each branch of the stream ,",
    "the fwhm spread in angular momentum is about @xmath99 . for a narrow stream at @xmath100 ,",
    "the spread in velocity is @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , a gap that spans the width of the stream will be sheared by less than @xmath102 per gyr .",
    "figures [ fig : stream_maps_smooth ] and [ fig : stream_maps_lcdm ] show the time evolution of the smooth and a @xmath0cdm  stream , respectively , from 7 to @xmath103 .",
    "the eos near the progenitor appear to shear by different amounts at different times , but this is due to the radial oscillation in the orbit where the radial period is @xmath104 . upon closer inspection of figure",
    "[ fig : stream_maps_lcdm ] , we also note that not only do subhalo gaps have complicated morphologies , but their orientations flip back and forth in a radial period due to the spread in @xmath31 . nevertheless ,",
    "comparing panels of the same radial phase at one radial period apart , the end points of each gap across the width of the stream do not shift by any appreciable amount .",
    "rather , the morphologies of the subhalo gaps are already apparent as each gap first appears .",
    "if the linear density of a stream is calculated by integrating the entire thickness of the stream in traversing slices along the stream , then the contrast of the gap will be reduced .",
    "this is because the edges of the gaps are not perfectly straight across the width of the stream , so dividing the stream into slices will smear out the density contrast . to investigate how much the smearing will affect gap detection , we calculate the linear densities in two ways .",
    "( 1 ) integrating cylindrical slices of radius 1 kpc along the stream , hereafter the `` whole width , '' where 1 kpc was chosen to cover the entire thickness of the whole stream . ( 2 ) integrating only the cylindrical slices of radius 0.04 kpc centered along the best fit line of each branch of the stream , hereafter the `` central width , '' where 0.04 kpc is chosen to mimic the gd-1 s observed width of 0.08 kpc @xcite .",
    "this central width then encloses about 30%40% of the mass of the whole width , depending on its orbital phase where , for example , the stream is radially compressed during pericentric passage .",
    "the stream is then aligned to cartesian coordinates where the horizontal axis is the offset position along the stream from the progenitor , and the vertical axis is the radial offset from the galactocentric distance of the progenitor .",
    "this is done by tracing a best fit line along the stream . for each segment in the line ,",
    "the particles in between the end points of the segment are rotated such that the galactic center points toward the @xmath105 direction in this plot .",

    "compared to the smooth stream , this @xmath0cdm  stream shows much more structures at various scales . in general , whether by eos ( mostly inside @xmath106 ) or by subhalo perturbations , gaps have complicated morphologies and do not even have straight edges across the width of the stream.,width=336 ]      figures [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange0][fig : density_gaps_central_massrange13 ] show the densities along the whole and central widths of the smooth stream and a @xmath0cdm  stream from 3 to @xmath107 .",
    "the streams younger than @xmath108 are not shown as the stream is @xmath109 long at those ages , so the gaps are dominated by very prominent eos . moreover",
    ", the stream itself does not yet have a large enough cross section to produce enough gaps for meaningful statistics . in each panel ,",
    "the shaded columns represent the gaps that are found on the scale of the columns widths .",
    "although these gaps are identified as being 99% significant , the density contrasts of the gaps have not been quantified . for the rest of this paper , we assume that all gaps identified at 99% significance can be observed . note that because the gap finding process is applied independently to each snapshot , the shaded columns do not necessarily represent the time evolutions of individual gaps .",
    "instead , the shaded columns show the general distributions of gaps  both in space and in gap lengths .",
    "our gap finding method is has a number of problems . in the smooth stream ( figures [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange0 ] and [ fig : density_gaps_central_massrange0 ] ) , our method by construction identifies 1% of the noise as gaps",
    "this is why there can be spurious gaps detected well beyond 5 kpc away from the progenitor , even though eos tend to form very close to the progenitor .",
    "also , the overall profile of the stream density can sometimes be confused as a gap as well .",
    "one example is a gap at @xmath110 at @xmath111 in figure [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange13 ] , where a smooth density gradient from 3 to @xmath112 is mistaken as the right half of a long gap . at the 95% confidence limit , both kinds of false positives are quite common and can often be identified by eye .",
    "for the results below , we show gaps that are 99% significant , which minimizes the occurrence false positives .    .",

    "we aim to study the validity of equation ( [ eqn : gaprate_gapsize_formula ] ) in our self - consistent stream .",
    "we set the `` length '' of each gap as the scale @xmath83 of the matched filter which identified the gap ( section [ sec : gapfinding ] )      figures [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange0 ] and [ fig : density_gaps_central_massrange0 ] show the gaps identified in the smooth stream integrated using the whole thickness and central thickness , respectively .",
    "clearly , the gaps due to eos are clustered at @xmath79 on both sides of the progenitor , and all the gaps have very similar sizes .",
    "the measured @xmath116 would peak at short gaps and quickly drops off beyond @xmath120 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : gaprate_gapsize_formula ] ) is meant to describe an idealized gap spectrum produced by subhalos , and not by eos .",
    "a key result of this study , as discussed below , is that the gap spectrum for subhalo gaps looks very different than the gap spectrum for eos .",
    "the existence of gaps longer than @xmath44 would be an indication that processes other than eos are responsible for the gaps .",
    "furthermore , subhalo gaps can be found everywhere along the whole stream .",
    "eos can only be observed in the immediate vicinity of the progenitor .",
    "as an ideal case , equation ( [ eqn : gaprate_gapsize_formula ] ) ignores the visibility of gaps when the same position of a stream suffers impacts by multiple subhalos at different times .",
    "for instance , after one major impact by a massive subhalo which results in a long and high contrast density gap at an early time , subsequent impacts by less massive subhalos in that same region at a later time may not be visible .",
    "gap overlapping can be minimized by the following experiment .",
    "we run 13 separate simulations with the same initial conditions as the star cluster , but the subhalo masses are selected differentially from table [ table : subhalo_massrange ] .",
    "this allows each stream to interact with an independent set of subhalos of a very small range of masses .",
    "overlapping can still occur within the same simulation for each set of subhalos ( hence a small number of gaps can still be eliminated ) , but to a much lesser extent than using integrated mass ranges .",
    "figure [ fig : ru_summed ] shows the measured gap spectrum from the gaps collected from all 13 simulations using independent sets of subhalos . in the top panel which includes all gaps , the measured gap spectrum matches equation ( [ eqn : gaprate_gapsize_formula ] ) reasonably well",
    "however , this is a coincidence as the gaps contain eos which are not described by equation ( [ eqn : gaprate_gapsize_formula ] ) . in an attempt to eliminate eos , in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : ru_summed ] ,",
    "the gaps that are located within @xmath2 away from the progenitor are eliminated .",
    "when computing the gap formation rates in these cases , the number of gaps are divided by a stream length which is reduced by @xmath80 and a stream age which reduced by @xmath121 ( i.e. , the age of the stream when it is @xmath80 long ) .",
    "this allows us to facilitate a fair comparison of gap spectra against the cases which include all gaps in the entire stream . comparing the two panels in figure [ fig : ru_summed ]",
    ", we can see the masking of the @xmath80 around the progenitor reduces the abundance of shorter gaps .",

    "figure [ fig : ru_all ] compares the measured gap spectra of both the whole and central streams for three mass ranges , with and without the gaps within @xmath2 away from the progenitor .",
    "clearly in all cases , the ideal gap spectrum over estimates the measured spectrum by nearly an order of magnitude due to gap overlapping .",
    "similar to the simulations with independent sets of subhalos ( figure [ fig : ru_summed ] ) , the gap spectra produced by full sets of subhalos do not have strong dependence on stream age and integrating width .",
    "the only exception is the youngest stream shown at 5 gyr which consistently has higher @xmath116 than the older streams .",
    "however , when the gaps near the progenitor are eliminated , the numbers of gaps at @xmath111 in all cases decrease significantly , where the gap spectra are dominated by a single gap at @xmath123 , and a number of extremely short gaps .",
    "this is likely because the stream is still young , and the effective length of the stream ( after masking @xmath80 centered at the progenitor ) is only @xmath124 .",
    "this eliminates a significant part of the stream , making its stream statistics unreliable .",
    "the weak dependence of the gap spectrum on the integrating width for linear density is also worth noting .",
    "figure [ fig : stream_maps_lcdm ] shows that gaps in general have much more complicated morphologies than straight edges across the width of the stream .",
    "the explanation for these morphologies requires detailed understanding of how subhalo perturbations manifest in a self - consistent stream , which is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "while @xcite studied the dynamics of subhalo perturbations for an idealized stream , we defer the self - consistent case to a future study .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result is that the gap spectra do not show obvious dependence on subhalo masses .",

    "a gap spectrum for gd-1 has been observed by @xcite , but we emphasize that the gap spectra from our simulated streams in this study should not be directly compared to the one in @xcite because our models for both the star cluster and the galaxy halo are chosen in favor of a simple interpretation , and may be missing some complications discussed in section [ sec : other_effects ] .",
    "we first project each stream onto sky coordinates . for simplicity",
    ", we put the hypothetical observer at the center of the galaxy , and then project each particle onto the azimuthal and altitudinal plane in galactocentric coordinates .",
    "since the our stream progenitor is orbiting along the @xmath20-plane in a spherical potential , the smooth stream appears as a straight line along the azimuthal direction , and each @xmath0cdm  stream appears only a few degrees off the azimuthal plane due to subhalo perturbations .",
    "the density along the stream is simply the number of particles in bins of @xmath129 in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the match filter approach to detect gaps remain the same as the analysis above , but the 12 filter scales ( figure [ fig : filter_scales ] ) are now logarithmically spaced in angular units from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , and the noise levels are obtained from the regions at @xmath132 , rather than @xmath133 , away from the progenitor .",
    "the choice of bin size and filter scales are on the same orders of magnitude as @xcite , but putting the hypothetical observer at the galactic center may affect angular sizes by factors of @xmath134 .    to ensure that the behaviors of the simulated streams are typical , we simulate each @xmath0cdm  stream 10 times with the same initial conditions for the star cluster , but different realizations of the same subhalo distributions . at the end",
    "we take the median numbers of gaps of the 10 streams to avoid outliers .",
    "one surprising result from section [ sec : lcdm_stream_with_all_subhalos ] is that the gap spectrum has little to no dependence on age and subhalo masses .",
    "to investigate what this means when interpreting observations , the top panel of figure [ fig : numgaps_time ] shows the cumulative numbers of gaps longer than @xmath130 ( i.e. , all gaps detected in the entire stream ) as functions of time . at @xmath135",
    ", the numbers of gaps due to subhalos vary according to the orbital phase of the stream progenitor .",
    "the `` bursts '' in numbers of gaps in the @xmath0cdm  streams occur when the streams are stretched as they passes through the pericenters of their orbits . at @xmath136 ,",
    "on the other hand , this correlation does not exist for two reasons .",
    "first , our detection method ( section [ sec : gapfinding ] ) uses the parts of the stream that are @xmath133 ( before sky projection ) or @xmath132 ( after sky projection ) away from the progenitor in order to estimate noise . at @xmath136 ,",
    "the length of the stream varies between a few to @xmath137 , which may not be long enough to estimate noise .",
    "second , in only @xmath111 the stream does not yet have enough time and to interact with subhalos .",
    "both the total number of gaps and the dynamical age of the stream are difficult to measure , as the some parts of a stream may not be observable .",
    "we define a more useful quantity @xmath138 which is the cumulative number of gaps longer than a given gap length per unit stream length . in other words , leaving the age of the stream as an unknown , @xmath138 differs from @xmath116 in section [ sec : gap_size_distribution ] by a normalization by age , and that @xmath138 is after sky projection . in the next section",
    "we show that gaps due to eos and subhalos have very different @xmath139 distributions which are directly observable .    .",
    "each colored line represents the median of 10 realizations of an identical subhalo distribution ( with @xmath43 as upper mass limit ) , and the black thick line represents the smooth stream .",
    "bottom : the vertical dashed lines are visual guides which show that the variation of the number of gaps are correlated with the orbital phase of the stream progenitor .",
    "these plots show that the cumulative number of gaps in a stream on average is increasing in time , but instantaneously the number of gaps observable can have an even stronger dependence on the orbital phase of the stream than on the stream s dynamical age or subhalo masses.,width=336 ]      another important distinction between simulations and observations is the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . at 5 and @xmath103 our smooth stream",
    "is represented by about 60,000 and 80,000 particles in total , respectively ( figure [ fig : massloss ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that the @xmath140 visible segment of gd-1 consists of 3000 stars . at an average distance of @xmath141 ,",
    "the visible segment is @xmath141 long . in our simulations , after 5 and @xmath103 , the average stream lengths are about 20 and @xmath142 , respectively ( figure [ fig : massloss ] ) .",
    "this means that our simulated stream should be represented about eight times fewer particles in order to be comparable to observations . with the progenitor masked , we reduce the number of particles in the stream by randomly sampling the stream using two , four , and eight times fewer particles than the original stream .",
    "the particle reduction applies to both the stream of interest and the smooth stream which is the source for estimating noise .",
    "this allows us to investigate the importance of high s / n .",
    "note that in our simulation each particle is equivalent to about @xmath143 , which is less massive than the typical stars that are detected in observations .",
    "our simulations are not meant to be physical models of the real stream . in this section ,",
    "we are only concerned about matching the numbers of particles in the simulations to the numbers of stars in the observation .",
    "as the stars escape from the progenitor , the stream s self - gravity becomes negligible @xcite , and the particles masses are no longer important .",
    "figure [ fig : reduction_gaps ] shows the density profiles of the @xmath0cdm  stream with subhalo masses @xmath144 at @xmath103 projected onto the sky .",
    "the panels show the gaps detected in the same stream after three levels of particle reduction . even after reduction by a factor of eight",
    ", the stream appears to have retained most of its gaps despite a lower s / n .    in figure [ fig : gd1_reduction ] , each line shows the median of ten gap spectra from the same stream but with 10 realizations of the same subhalo distribution . in each panel , the solid ( dashed ) lines represent the times when the progenitor is at the pericenter ( apocenter ) of its orbit .",
    "when the stream is compressed and stretched as it oscillates radially ( see figure [ fig : massloss ] ) , its length can differ by up to a factor of two .",
    "careful inspection of figures [ fig : numgaps_time ] and [ fig : gd1_reduction ] shows that during pericentric passages , the numbers of gaps are at maximum , but @xmath138 is at minimum because the stream length is also at maximum . for a @xmath0cdm  stream at high s / n ( upper left panel in figure [ fig : gd1_reduction ] ) , the gap spectra are not sensitive to this oscillation , except with an excess of shorter gaps and fewer longer gaps , which are expected as the stream , including its longitudinal structure , is compressed during apocentric passage . at low s / n ( lower left panel in figure [ fig : gd1_reduction ] ) , however , the gap spectrum during apocentric passage is consistently higher than that during pericentric passage .",
    "this is because the length of the stream is insensitive to the s / n , but the number of gaps is not .",
    "therefore , high s / n data for the stream is important when studying stream gaps .",
    "otherwise , the spectrum may be over- or underestimated depending on the orbital phase .",
    "the right panels in figure [ fig : gd1_reduction ] show the gap spectra of the smooth stream .",
    "they are also somewhat sensitive to s / n , but the most obvious difference from the spectra of @xmath0cdm  stream is the shape of the spectra .",
    "this is especially obvious during pericentric passage where the gap spectra rapidly drop off to zero for gaps longer than @xmath145 . even during apocentric passage ,",
    "the gap spectra remain flat at gap lengths @xmath146 .",
    "if the gaps originated from subhalo perturbations , then the gap spectrum should be steep and extend well beyond @xmath147 .",
    "cdm  stream with subhalos of masses @xmath144 at 8 gyr , projected onto the sky .",
    "each panel represents a stream whose number of particles have been reduced by the factor indicated and binned at @xmath129 throughout . without reduction ( top panel ) , the stream contains about 80,000 particles .",
    "the stream retains most of its gaps even after particle reduction by a factor of eight.,width=336 ]           an interesting confusion for gd-1 in particular is that gd-1 s progenitor has not been identified .",
    "if gd-1 s progenitor has evaded observation , and the observation corresponds to a segment of the stream which is close enough to the progenitor such that eos can be observed , then gd-1 may be a poor choice as a probe for missing satellites .",
    "however , this is unlikely because eos are observable only in a small segment of the stream , and subhalo gaps are observable everywhere along the stream .",
    "another possibility is that gd-1 s progenitor may have been completely disrupted . in this case",
    ", the tidal radius of the progenitor approaches zero .",
    "since the spacing between eos are proportional to the tidal radius of the progenitor , this means that the eos should also fade away as the progenitor is disrupted @xcite . therefore , despite its lack of progenitor gd-1 should be a viable probe for missing satellites .",
    "the gap spectrum of gd-1 has been measured by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum show presence of gaps at all lengths between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which is sufficient to rule out a smooth and spherical potential . to facilitate a conclusive analysis on the origin of the gaps in gd-1 , we need to consider a much more realistic model which include the effects discussed in section [ sec : other_effects ] .",
    "we consider the effects of subhalos as massive as @xmath43 , since the effects by more massive subhalos are not relevant to us .",
    "gaps caused by subhalos at these masses produce long gaps with high - density contrasts .",
    "for example , an obvious gap located at @xmath126 at 4 gyr shown in figures [ fig : density_gaps_whole_massrange13 ] and [ fig : density_gaps_central_massrange13 ] are caused by a @xmath150 subhalo .",
    "in fact , the perturbation by @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) subhalos can be so catastrophic that the stream is warped and divided into segments . as a result ,",
    "a stream which originated from one progenitor can be observed as a few separate streams .",
    "observations of pal-5 s and gd-1 s gaps , on the other hand , show small - scale density fluctuations in a long , narrow stream , so these two streams are not sensitive to subhalos above @xmath43 . by coincidence , this upper limit approximately coincides with the upper limit beyond which the models of warm dark matter can be no longer be distinguished from cdm .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 is a reasonable upper limit where our simulations can be useful .    in the low - mass end",
    ", we only consider the effects of subhalos down to @xmath153 . from a separate simulation of the same stream but with only the subhalos with masses @xmath154 , the density profile is indistinguishable from the smooth stream , and the gap statistics are identical .",
    "furthermore , section [ sec : lcdm_stream_with_all_subhalos ] shows that the gap spectra have very little dependence on mass . changing the mass lower limit from @xmath155 to @xmath156 produced indistinguishable gap spectra .",
    "this means that subhalos less massive than @xmath157 , even though they are much more abundant than those of higher masses ( equation ( [ eqn : subhalo_massfunction ] ) ) , have minimal effects on our stream .",
    "the milky way has about 160 known gcs @xcite , and a few hundred dgs brighter than @xmath158 after bias corrections ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether these known satellite systems , rather than the truly `` missing '' satellites , can contribute to the observed stream gaps .",
    "typical gcs have masses @xmath157 , which correspond to the low end of our mass spectrum of subhalos . in the same mass range , though , there are orders of magnitudes more subhalos ( e.g. , @xmath159 subhalos at @xmath160 ) than gcs , so gcs are unlikely to contribute significantly to observed stream gaps . on the other hand , dgs",
    "are commonly found at @xmath161 @xcite which is the high end of our mass spectrum of subhalos . at that mass range ( @xmath162 subhalos at @xmath163 ) , the number of known dgs are only 1 order of magnitude below the number of subhalos , so dgs may contribute to some observed gaps",
    ". however , a common limitation in understanding the contributions from both gcs and dgs is their orbits , especially when the kinematics of these satellites are not well constrained .",
    "as done in our simulations ( section [ sec : subhalo_mass_ranges ] ) , subhalos that do not approach the stream s orbit will interact minimally with the stream .",
    "table [ table : subhalo_massrange ] shows that in our realizations of subhalos , only @xmath164 of them would approach to within @xmath165 of gd-1 s orbit .",
    "this means that most known satellites may never interact with a gd-1-like stream , and that stream gaps , if they were indeed due to satellites and were not eos , are more likely due to satellites that have never been observed .      in order to keep our results simple , the galaxy",
    "is modeled as stationary , spherical nfw potential , the subhalos as static , test masses , and the satellite as a collisionless king model .",
    "these models ignore a number of known dynamical complications .    _ two - body relaxation . _",
    "the star cluster is modeled as a collisionless system with relaxation timescale of @xmath166 .",
    "globular clusters typically have relaxation timescales of @xmath167 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) , so mass loss should originate from dynamical evaporation , in addition to tidal disruption . as a result , the star cluster should be disrupted even faster than we measured in figure [ fig : massloss ] .",
    "this may have an important effect on the formation of gaps , which depends on the details of the dynamics of a stream @xcite .",
    "the relation between gaps and mass loss mechanism will be investigated in a future study .",
    "_ dynamical friction ( df ) .",
    "_ both the star cluster and subhalos should suffer from df as they orbit around the dark matter halo .",
    "comparing the magnitudes of the accelerations due to df and due to the orbit , @xmath168 for both the star cluster at 22 kpc and a @xmath169 subhalo at 100 kpc , where @xmath170 is the log of the ratio of the maximum and minimum impact distances @xcite .",
    "therefore , df is negligible throughout our model .",
    "_ disk shocking : _",
    "@xcite found that the evolution of pal-5 is driven by the tidal shocks when crossing the galactic disk , which is not modeled in our simulations .",
    "the orbit of pal-5 in @xcite has peri- and apogalacticon at 5.5 kpc and 19 kpc , respectively , whereas our smooth stream has peri- and apogalacticon at 15 kpc and 30 kpc , respectively .",
    "being farther away from the the galactic center , if our simulations contained a disk , its effect should be less severe for our simulated stream than pal-5 .",
    "moreover , @xcite concluded that disk shocking is not responsible for the observed structure in pal-5 , while @xcite concluded that eos persist even under the influence of disk shocks , so the absence of a disk should not significantly change our conclusion .",
    "the gap formation rate with and without subhalos in the presence of a disk is beyond the scope of this study .    _",
    "halo shape and collapse history : _ @xcite found that the shape of the halo potential can have a larger effect than subhalos have on the over all structure of a stream . however , their simulations focused on streams which originated from dgs at @xmath171 , as well as subhalos at @xmath161 which is the high end of our mass spectrum of subhalos .",
    "the small gaps from a stream originating from a gc in a non - spherical halo has yet to be studied .",
    "in fact , since the initial collapse of the entire halo , the potential can not be stationary throughout a hubble time , which is the timescale of our simulations . in the future",
    ", we aim to repeat a similar study using potentials which resulted directly from high resolution simulations such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent halo and subhalo potentials from those simulations can eliminate the idealized models in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "for the first time , we used n - body simulations to model the disruption of a collisionless star cluster which formed a narrow stream similar to pal-5 and gd-1 , and we investigated the phenomenology of gaps that originated from the perturbations by subhalos predicted in the @xmath0cdm  cosmological model .",
    "analytical predictions of stream gap statistics in previous studies were all based on massless particles distributed to mock realistic streams , but the dynamics of gaps have never been studied in self - consistent models . with a stream from a self - consistent model",
    ", we characterized the gap length distribution which can be used as a tool to understand the origin of stream gaps seen in observations .",
    "the properties of the subhalos in our simulations were approximations to those in the aquarius simulation @xcite .",
    "we ran 14 simulations of the same stream  1 without any subhalos ( the smooth stream ) , and 1 for each cumulative mass range in table [ table : subhalo_massrange ] ( the @xmath0cdm  streams ) . in each stream",
    "we looked for gaps using a matched filter approach previously used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that , in addition to subhalo perturbations , the overdensities of particles due to their epicyclic motions as the progenitor loses mass @xcite can also produce gaps .",
    "therefore , even without subhalos , `` gaps '' can appear within @xmath172 away from the progenitor .",
    "for the first time , our match filter approach accounted for these eos together with the gaps due to subhalo perturbations .",
    "@xcite first noted that subhalos gaps were typically diagonal and not perpendicular to the stream due to the range in angular momenta across the width of the stream .",
    "we investigated whether this could be a hindrance to gap detection . by measuring the distribution of angular momenta in our simulated stream",
    ", we estimated that the two ends of a gap across the width of a stream were sheared by no more than a @xmath102 per gyr .",
    "rather , subhalo gaps show complicated morphologies which were already imprinted into the stream as soon as the gaps first occurred .",
    "in addition to integrating the entire thickness of the stream , we also considered the case where the linear density are integrated using only the central 0.08 kpc of the stream in order to minimize the impact of gaps morphologies .",
    "we found that the resulting gap rate spectra the two cases were similar .",
    "therefore , gap morphology does not affect our conclusion .",
    "we tested the validity of the idealized gap spectrum @xmath116 , or the cumulative number of gaps per unit stream length per unit stream age as a function of gap length @xmath117 , derived by @xcite .",
    "we found that overlapping gaps in the stream can significantly reduce @xmath116 , and that the dependences of @xmath116 on subhalo masses and stream age are smaller than its dependence on the stream s orbital phase .",
    "therefore , the stream s orbital phase must be known when interpreting gap formation rates in observations .",
    "we considered how to interpret gap spectra from observations by projecting the stream onto the sky , and for each @xmath0cdm  stream we also simulated them using ten realizations of the same subhalo distributions .",
    "one observational concern is the s / n of the stream s detection .",
    "we down - sampled our simulated streams with less particles in order to match the s / n which is similar to the gd-1 detection @xcite .",
    "our result indicated that at gd-1 s s / n , the gap spectrum can be biased by the orbital phase of the stream .",
    "in addition , we compared gap spectra produced purely by eos and by eos and subhalos together in a @xmath0cdm  halo .",
    "we showed that the gap spectra of the former are limited in gap lengths , and that the latter have a much larger variety of gap lengths .",
