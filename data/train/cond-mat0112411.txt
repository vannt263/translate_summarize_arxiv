    "decoherence ( or dephasing ) caused by external perturbations is an important problem of quantum systems . within equilibrium statistical mechanics , a convenient formula for estimating the dissipation by the environment",
    "was presented by caldeira and leggett@xcite .",
    "there decoherence was treated as an interaction non - local in the imaginary time .",
    "the formula was shown to be useful in considering macroscopic quantum phenomena@xcite , in which the tunneling rate was calculated only as a static quantity .",
    "effects of decoherence on electron systems was studied in the 80 s in the context of weak localization ( e.g. , decoherence by phonons and electron - electron interaction)@xcite .",
    "decoherence gives rise to a mass of electron - electron propagator ( cooperon ) , which governs magnetoresistance .",
    "decoherence time due to electron - electron interaction was calculated by solving the cooperon equation@xcite and as a mass of the cooperon@xcite .",
    "later it was demonstrated that this dephasing time is equivalent to the time defined in an intuitive way from a decay of the overlap of wave function@xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that this definition does not always work as we see below .",
    "recently decoherence by a quantum two level system ( tls ) has been theoretically studied@xcite . in these works temperature dependence of dephasing time , @xmath0 ,",
    "is calculated , motivated by experimental finding of the saturation of dephasing time as @xmath1 in disordered metal@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of saturation appears still controversial .    for studies of decoherence , recent mesoscopic systems are suitable , since decoherence can be detected in a controlled manner .",
    "a direct way to study decoherence is to use the interference of two different paths in a small ring .",
    "the interference leads to an oscillation of conductance as a function of external magnetic flux through the ring ( aharonov - bohm ( ab)@xcite and altshuler - aronov - spivak ( aas)@xciteoscillations@xcite ) . the oscillation pattern changes if a perturbation causes scattering or dephasing .",
    "the first direct measurement of the effect of the phase due to transport through a quantum dot was carried out by use of ab effect by yacoby et . al.@xcite .",
    "further studies revealed rigidity of the phase , which is consequence of time - reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "the amplitude and phase of ab oscillation was calculated in the presence of a dot driven by a ac field in ref .",
    "the effect of a time varying potential on conductance of a ring was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently ab effect in the ballistic case has been experimentally investigated@xcite .",
    "it was argued that the temperature dependence of the ab amplitude indicates dephasing rate proportional to @xmath2@xcite .",
    "this behavior was discussed to be consistent with theoretical estimate of the dephasing due to charge fluctuation taking account of the existence of the leads@xcite .",
    "however the argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite might be too naive because theoretically the role of dephasing on ab effect in the ballistic case is not obvious , since dephasing is incorporated by cooperon , which exists only in the dirty case .",
    "a possible dephasing s effect on ballistic current may be by changing the spectral function@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the response of the current through a narrow ring with a magnetic flux after a time - dependent environment is switched on . by use of measurement of electronic properties with high ( thz ) time - resolution@xcite , observation of such current response and time - resolved dephasing process would be possible .",
    "the current response may provide us direct information on microscopic relaxation times ( elastic ( @xmath3 ) and inelastic lifetime ( @xmath4 ) ) and properties of the perturbation source . as the environment we take tls .",
    "the transient current at low temperatures is calculated diagrammatically using non - equilibrium green function@xcite .",
    "coupling to tls is included to the second order and a linear response with respect to the probe electronic field is considered .",
    "ab current is calculated in the ballistic case treating the arm of the ring as one - dimensional .",
    "( the response of ab current as sample dependent fluctuation in a dirty case would be similar to that of aas current . ) a generic expression of the ab response is obtained in terms of the correlation functions of the perturbation source .",
    "it is shown that only the amplitude of the ab oscillation is affected , consistent with the phase rigidity@xcite .",
    "the reduction of the amplitude is shown to be simply due to the scattering into other electron states and is not interpreted as dephasing .",
    "the overlap of the wave function with the initial state exhibits a decay after tls is switched on , but this is nothing to do with dephasing .",
    "this is in contrast to the decay caused by electron - electron interaction in a disordered case@xcite .",
    "theoretically this difference is natural since dephasing in the strict sense can not be described by one - particle propagation ( a green function with an elastic lifetime ) .",
    "the effect is incorporated only when we take into account the particle - particle ladder ( cooperon ) , which represents the interference between a path and the reversed path in the presence of elastic impurity scattering .",
    "physically interaction with a single tls itself gives a definite phase factor and can not cause dephasing in the ballistic case . to cause dephasing , some randomness such as impurities is needed to give uncertainty to the phase due to the interaction .",
    "if there are many tlss with different energy , dephasing would appear even in the ballistic case .    in the calculation of aas current (  [ secaas ] ) , dephasing time @xmath4",
    "is included phenomenologically ( we do not care about the origin here ) .",
    "the lowest order contribution we calculate corresponds to the correction to @xmath4 by tls .",
    "the calculation of response of the aas current is very complicated and hence we show the leading term only .",
    "effect of oscillating external field is briefly discussed in  [ secac ] .",
