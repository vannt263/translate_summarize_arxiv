    "the loss of particle number as a good quantum number is a serious deficiency of the bcs and hfb ( hartree  fock  bogolyubov ) approximations in their applications to finite nuclei .",

    "have been considered by many authors : cf .",
    ", for example , the number - projected bcs approximation of dietrich , mang , and pradal @xcite , the projected quasi - particle model of lande , ottaviani and savoia @xcite , the antisymmetrized geminal power states of coleman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the broken pair model of lorazo , gambhir , and others @xcite , talmi s generalized seniority scheme @xcite , and the coherent correlated pair method of vary and plastino @xcite .",
    "a review of the subject has been given by allaart _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "a common feature of these schemes is to approximate the ground state , for a system in which pair correlations dominate , by a state of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a quasi - particle vacuum state and @xmath2 is a projector onto the space of states of particle number @xmath3 .",
    "we show herein that such a projection can be applied analytically , when the wave functions are expressed in a coherent - state representation .",
    "more importantly , projection from quasi - particle states gives a complete set of @xmath3-particle states which reflect many of the properties of the states from which they were projected .",
    "thus , a potentially exact formalism emerges which is able to take advantage of the physical insights gained from the bcs and hfb approximations .",
    "analytic number projection when combined with analytic methods for projecting out states of good angular momentum from deformed intrinsic states @xcite raises the possibility of developing good theories of nuclei which exhibit both rotational and superconducting properties",
    ". it also suggests a way of extending the physically significant definition of generalized seniority to the classification of complete sets of orthonormal states .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict consideration in this paper to the bcs model . however , the methods extend to the general hb theory by the number projection methods given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for each @xmath4-shell , there is an su(2 ) quasispin algebra spanned by the operators @xmath5 where @xmath6 are creation and annihilation operators for a nucleon ( e.g. , neutron ) which satisfy the fermion anticommutation relations @xmath7 note that we follow einstein s convention of using upper indices to label the components of a tensor contragredient to a tensor labeled by lower indices . with this convention ,",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath8 with superscripts is the hermitian adjoint of the creation operator @xmath9 and the annihilation operator @xmath10 with subscripts is the @xmath11 component of a spherical tensor .",
    "the contraction of a pair of upper and lower indices is then a scalar ; e.g. , @xmath12 is the number operator for the @xmath4-shell .",

    "more generally , a state @xmath20 of @xmath21 particles that satisfies the equations @xmath22 is said to have seniority @xmath23 and multishell seniority @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",

    "the simplicity of the bcs and hfb theories stems from the fact that the quasi - particle operators of the bogolyubov  valatin transformation are also quasispin transforms of nucleon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "in particular , a coherent state of the seniority - zero irrep @xmath30 is the vacuum state of the quasi - particles defined , for real values of @xmath31 , by the bogolyubov  valatin transformation @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
