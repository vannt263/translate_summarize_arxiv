    "in the quark sector the language of the unitarity triangles ( uts ) has proved to be quite useful in describing weak cp violation which is governed by the nontrivial phase of the @xmath0 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark flavor mixing matrix @xcite . the same ut language",
    "was first applied to the lepton sector in 1999 @xcite to illustrate cp violation in neutrino oscillations , and a peculiar role of the majorana phases in such leptonic uts was emphasized in 2000 @xcite . since then",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to this kind of geometrical description of lepton flavor mixing and its applications in neutrino phenomenology @xcite@xcite .",
    "thanks to a number of well - established neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , one has determined the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 to a good degree of accuracy in the standard three - flavor scheme @xcite .",
    "although the sign of @xmath13 remains unknown , a preliminary hint for @xmath14 has been seen by combining the latest t2k @xcite and daya bay @xcite data @xcite .",
    "this progress is remarkable , because it allows us to plot the uts of the @xmath0 pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath15 @xcite in the complex plane to show their real shapes .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is just to do this job .",
    "we are going to classify the six uts into two categories : three dirac triangles governed by the orthogonality relations @xmath16 which are insensitive to the majorana phases of @xmath15 ; and three majorana triangles dictated by the orthogonality relations @xmath17 whose orientations are fixed by the majorana phases of @xmath15 . in section 2 the real shapes of these six triangles will be shown with the help of the best - fit results of six neutrino oscillation parameters , and their uncertainties associated with the @xmath18 uncertainties of the input parameters will be briefly illustrated .",
    "furthermore , the possibilities of right or isosceles uts in a given neutrino mass ordering will be discussed , and the connections of the majorana uts with neutrino - antineutrino oscillations and neutrino decays will be explored .",
    "on the other hand , we are curious about whether the reconstructed elements of the effective majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath19 can be similarly described in the complex plane .",
    "the answer is affirmative , but this will involve the quadrangles instead of the triangles in general @xcite . in the neutrino mass limit",
    "@xmath20 or @xmath2 , which is compatible with current neutrino oscillation data and allows one to remove one of the majorana phases , the relations in eq .",
    "( 3 ) will be simplified to describe six triangles .",
    "such mass triangles ( mts ) are phenomenologically interesting in the sense that they are directly related to some rare but important lepton - number - violating ( lnv ) processes .",
    "the example associated with the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath21 ) decay has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper we are going to show how each mt formed by @xmath3 ( for @xmath4 ) and its two component vectors in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 limit looks like .",
    "the relations of such triangles to the majorana phases and to the lnv decays @xmath5 in the type - ii seesaw mechanism will also be illustrated .",
    "let us stress that considering the neutrino mass limit @xmath22 or @xmath2 makes sense in several aspects .",
    "experimentally , this possibility is not in conflict with any available data .",
    "theoretically , it is consistent with the spirit of occam s razor @xcite , and either @xmath23 or @xmath24 can naturally be obtained in a neutrino mass model ( e.g. , the minimal type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "phenomenologically , verifying or excluding this special case may help explore the true neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "it is also appealing in cosmology because it implies that today s cosmic neutrino background , whose typical temperature is only about 1.9 k ( i.e. , about @xmath25 ev ) , may have both relativistic and nonrelativistic components !",
    "the @xmath0 pmns lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath15 is commonly parametrized as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 containing two majorana phases . for the sake of simplicity , here we adopt the best - fit and @xmath18 results of six neutrino oscillation parameters obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite :    * normal mass ordering ( nmo ) of the neutrinos : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; * inverted mass ordering ( imo ) of the neutrinos : @xmath31 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath35 and @xmath40 .",
    "at present the two majorana phases @xmath41 and @xmath42 are completely unknown .",
    "hence we typically take @xmath43 and @xmath44 throughout this paper for the purpose of illustration . with the help of the best - fit inputs we plot the three dirac uts defined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the three majorana uts defined by eq . ( 2 ) in figures 1 and 2 , respectively , to show their real shapes . both the nmo and imo cases have been taken into account in our plotting , and the inner angles of the six triangles are defined in a consistent way as follows : @xmath45 = \\arg\\left[- \\frac{u^{}_{\\beta j } u^*_{\\beta k } } { u^{}_{\\gamma j } u^*_{\\gamma k}}\\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the greek and latin subscripts keep their cyclic running over @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "some discussions and comments are in order .    , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath48 @xcite in the nmo ( left panel ) or imo ( right panel ) case.,width=566 ]     and inputting the best - fit values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath48 @xcite in the nmo ( left panel ) or imo ( right panel ) case .",
    "the dashed triangles correspond to @xmath49 for comparison.,width=566 ]    \\(a ) in either the dirac case or the majorana case , the inner angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) seem to be sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering . to understand this",
    ", we notice @xmath54 in the leading - order approximation thanks to the relative smallness of @xmath11 .",
    "hence these four angles are actually sensitive to the best - fit value of @xmath48 , which belongs to the third quadrant in the nmo case ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) or the second quadrant in the imo case ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) as given above . in comparison ,",
    "the other five inner angles of the uts are not so sensitive to @xmath48 , and thus their results do not drastically change in the nmo and imo cases , as one can easily see in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "\\(b ) the so - called jarlskog invariant of the @xmath0 pmns matrix @xmath15 @xcite is now given as @xmath57 and it measures the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , all the areas of the six different uts are equal to @xmath58 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the nine inner angles of these triangles may form the following _ angle _ matrix : @xmath59 whose elements satisfy the sum rules @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the two off - diagonal asymmetries of @xmath63 about its @xmath64@xmath51@xmath65 and @xmath66@xmath51@xmath52 axes read as @xmath67 these results mean that @xmath63 only contains four independent elements , which can reversely be used to determine the dirac cp - violating phase and three flavor mixing angles .",
    "\\(c ) the three majorana uts are more interesting in the sense that their orientations depend on the values of the phase parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "even though the uts collapsed into lines in the @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) case , there would exist leptonic cp violation unless those lines happened to lie in the abscissa or ordinate axis .",
    "this point was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it has been clearly illustrated in figure 2 with the typical inputs @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , the orientations of triangles @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend respectively on @xmath42 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the chosen parametrization of @xmath15 .",
    "that is why @xmath73 keeps unchanged when the @xmath77 case is shifted to the @xmath78 case in our plotting . in general , the majorana uts @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 with arbitrary values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be obtained through rotating their counterparts with @xmath79 anticlockwise by @xmath42 , @xmath75 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "\\(d ) to reflect the majorana nature of the pmns matrix @xmath15 , one may redefine the majorana phases as follows : @xmath81 with the latin subscripts running over @xmath47 in a cyclic way .",
    "these phases are independent of the phases of three charged leptons , and they form the following _ phase _ matrix : @xmath82 where we have used the same inputs as those in obtaining eq .",
    "( 8) , and taken @xmath70 and @xmath71 for illustration .",
    "it is obvious that the nine elements in the three rows of @xmath83 satisfy the sum rules @xmath84 ( for @xmath85 ) @xcite , but those in the three columns do not have a definite correlation .",
    "hence the number of independent parameters in @xmath83 is six , two more as compared with that in @xmath63 .",
    "( 5 ) , the nine inner angles of the sixe uts can be expressed in terms of the nine elements of @xmath83 as @xmath86 in which the greek subscripts run over @xmath46 cyclically , and the  @xmath87 \" sign should be taken in a proper way to assure @xmath88 .",
    "the numerical results for the shapes and inner angles of @xmath89 ( for @xmath85 ) and @xmath90 ( for @xmath91 ) given above are subject to the inputs of the best - fit values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath48 . among them",
    ", @xmath48 involves the largest uncertainty .",
    "one may fix the values of the three flavor mixing angles to check how the shapes of six uts change with different values of @xmath48 .",
    "instead of making such a check by taking some numerical examples , let us outline a general observation based on the leading - order analytical approximations made in eq .",
    "it is clear how @xmath92 and @xmath93 vary with the change of @xmath48 .",
    "because @xmath94 holds as a consequence of the above approximations , the inner angles @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath65 must be small as required by the unitarity conditions , and hence @xmath98 must be the largest inner angle .",
    "this general analytical observation is actually supported by the explicit numerical results shown in eq .",
    "when the uncertainties of all the four input parameters are taken into account , the situation will become quite messy . to illustrate ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath18 intervals of the input quantities and calculate the nine inner angles of six uts .",
    "as illustrated in table 1 , the @xmath18 uncertainty of each inner angle is rather significant as compared with its best - fit outcome , implying a remarkable change of the shape of each ut . a direct illustration of such uncertainties of @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the complex plane is difficult , since all the sides and inner angles will deviate from those in the best - fit case ( i.e. , in figures 1 and 2 ) . at present one possible way out",
    "is to rescale and rotate each ut to make two of its three vertices always locate at the @xmath99 and @xmath100 points in the horizontal coordinate axis @xcite . in this case , however , the uncertainty associated with the third vertex of each rescaled ut remains quite significant . although the sides of each real ut and those of its rescaled counterpart are different , the inner angles of these two triangles are exactly the same .",
    "so table 1 is almost equally helpful for illustrating how the shapes of six uts are sensitive to the uncertainties of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and especially @xmath48 .",
    "once @xmath48 is determined in the next - generation accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments , it will be possible for us to see the true shapes of leptonic uts to a reasonably good degree of accuracy , just as we have seen the true shapes of six ckm uts in the quark sector today .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath101 is the jarlskog invariant of the ckm quark flavor mixing matrix .",
    "this result is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the area of each leptonic ut shown in figure 1 or 2 , where @xmath102 ( nmo ) or @xmath103 ( imo ) has been typically input . ]",
    ".the numerical results for nine inner angles of the six uts obtained with the inputs of the best - fit values and @xmath18 ranges of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "note that the unitarity conditions @xmath104 must hold ( for @xmath85 and @xmath105 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     assuming that a positive signal of the @xmath21 decay can be measured someday , then the corresponding knowledge of @xmath106 will allow one to predict the rates of some other rare lnv processes , such as @xmath107 from eq .",
    "once such a breakthrough really happens , it will definitely open a new window towards the deep secrets of majorana particles .",
    "neutrino physics has entered the era of precision measurements , in which one is doing the best one can to answer some important questions , including what the absolute neutrino mass scale is , whether massive neutrinos are the majorana particles , how large the effects of leptonic cp violation can be , and so on . before these questions are experimentally answered",
    ", one may theoretically or phenomenologically try every shift available to bridge the gap between the observable quantities and the fundamental flavor parameters in the neutrino sector . in this",
    "regard we have paid particular attention to an intuitive description of leptonic cp violation and effective majorana neutrino masses in the complex plane  namely , the dirac and majorana uts as well as the effective mts in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 limit .    with the help of the best - fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters ,",
    "we have plotted the six uts of the pmns matrix to show their real shapes in the complex plane .",
    "the connections of the majorana uts with neutrino - antineutrino oscillations and neutrino decays have been explored , and the possibilities of right or isosceles uts have also been discussed . in the second part of this paper , we have considered a special but phenomenologically allowed neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath23 or @xmath24 and the corresponding effective majorana neutrino masses @xmath3  the latter can form six mts in the complex plane . in this case we have shown how these mts look like by assuming the majorana phase @xmath42 to be @xmath108 as a typical example .",
    "the relations of such triangles to the lnv decays @xmath109 in the type - ii seesaw mechanism have been illustrated too .",
    "we hope that this kind of study may enrich the neutrino phenomenology to some extent .",
    "although the uts and mts can only provide us with a geometrical language to describe the flavor issues of massive neutrinos , they _ do _ have made some underlying physics more transparent and intuitive .",
    "so they are useful and interesting , and their phenomenological applications deserve some further exploration .",
