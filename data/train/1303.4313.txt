    "in this paper , @xmath2 is a positive integer ; @xmath3 is a prime power ; @xmath4 is a finite field with @xmath3 elements ; and @xmath1 is the group of invertible @xmath5 matrices with coefficients in @xmath4 , or , equivalently , the group of linear isomorphisms of the @xmath4-vector space @xmath6",
    ". it will be convenient to write @xmath7 for the composition of isomorphisms @xmath8 ( beware of the order of composition ) .",
    "the matrix of an isomorphism @xmath9 between two @xmath10-vector spaces and with respect to two bases @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath14 is @xmath15 the vectors being written in columns ; then @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 , we shall be interested in the group algebra @xmath18 , and more precisely in its center @xmath19 . a linear basis of @xmath19 is the set of conjugacy classes of @xmath20 , viewed as the formal sums of their elements .",
    "we want to address the following kind of problem :    let @xmath21 be two elements of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 the conjugacy classes of the diagonal matrices of size @xmath2 @xmath25 what is the expansion @xmath26 in conjugacy classes of the product @xmath27 computed in the center of the group algebra @xmath28 ?    at first sight , this problem might seem to be not so difficult : since @xmath29 and @xmath30 each leave invariant a subspace of dimension @xmath31 , the product @xmath32 of two matrices conjugated to @xmath29 and @xmath30 has to leave invariant a subspace of dimension at least @xmath33 , and as we shall see in a moment , this only leaves a few possibilities for the conjugacy class @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , by looking at how many ways the eigenspaces of the matrices can intersect , one can guess that the coefficients @xmath36 count configurations of subspaces in @xmath6 , and are therefore rational functions in @xmath3 and in its powers @xmath37 , up to @xmath38 .",
    "however , it is in practice quite hard to determine the set of possible conjugacy classes @xmath39 ; and also quite hard to compute the structure coefficients .",
    "the reader can already have a look at theorem [ productdegree1 ] , to realize that the result depends in particular on :    * whether @xmath3 is even or odd ; * in the odd case , whether @xmath40 is a square in @xmath22 or not .",
    "also , it is _ a priori _ unclear that the coefficients @xmath36 are in fact all polynomials in @xmath41 , with rational coefficients independent of @xmath2 .",
    "one might understand intuitively why this is true from the previous informal discussion : every number of subspaces of fixed dimension @xmath42 in @xmath6 is a polynomial in @xmath41 ( of degree @xmath42 ) , and the same holds when counting `` finite - dimensional configurations '' .",
    "however , a formal and rigorous proof demands a lot of combinatorial preparations , especially if one wants to _ compute _ the actual polynomials .",
    "the author conjectured this polynomiality a few years ago , and this will be one of the major result of the paper",
    ". we shall prove it in the general setting where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are replaced by arbitrary matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 that are completed by @xmath45 s on the diagonal to obtain matrices of size @xmath2 .",
    "we shall also provide a general framework which reduces all the computations to the case when @xmath46 , @xmath42 and @xmath47 being the sizes of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "in other words , knowing the structure coefficients @xmath51 , we shall have at the end of the paper an easy rule to compute all the coefficients @xmath52 .",
    "a similar and simpler problem has been solved for permutations by farahat and higman in @xcite , and forty years later , it was given a beautiful explanation by ivanov and kerov , see @xcite .",
    "fix two permutations @xmath53 and @xmath54 of size @xmath42 and @xmath47 ; we also assume @xmath53 and @xmath54 without fixed points in @xmath55\\!\\right]}$ ] and in @xmath56\\!\\right]}$ ] .",
    "for any @xmath57 , one can view @xmath53 and @xmath54 as elements of the symmetric group of order @xmath2 , denoted @xmath58 ; @xmath53 fixes the integers after @xmath42 and @xmath54 fixes the integer after @xmath47 . denote @xmath59 and @xmath60 the conjugacy classes of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath61 .",
    "then , there exists a unique finite set of permutations @xmath62 , and polynomials @xmath63 with rational coefficients and integer values at integers , such that @xmath64 using the well - known labeling of conjugacy classes of @xmath58 by integer partitions of size @xmath2 , one can of course restate this result with two partitions @xmath34 and @xmath65 of size @xmath42 and @xmath47 and without parts of size @xmath45 , and a finite set of partitions of size smaller than @xmath66 and again without parts of size @xmath45:[fhig ] @xmath67    the proof of ivanov and kerov uses the following idea : by manipulating _",
    "partial permutations _ that are permutations with a distinguished support @xmath68\\!\\right]}$ ] , one can construct an inverse system of graded algebras @xmath69 such that :    1 .",
    "each algebra @xmath70 projects onto @xmath71 via a morphism @xmath72 ; 2 .",
    "each algebra has a basis @xmath73 labelled by partitions @xmath34 of size smaller than @xmath2 , with @xmath74 ; @xmath75 is an explicit polynomial in @xmath2 ; 3 .",
    "the bases @xmath76 are compatible , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath77 , then the map @xmath78 sends @xmath79 to @xmath76 .    from this construction , an identity @xmath80 in the projective limit",
    "@xmath81 gives immediately the identity @xmath82 in all the centers of the group algebras @xmath71 ; this provides an easy proof of the theorem of farahat and higman .",
    "the same techniques and kind of results have been studied more recently by the author for product of geck - rouquier elements in the centers of the hecke algebras @xmath83 of the symmetric groups ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) ; and by o. tout in @xcite for product of classes in the algebras @xmath84 $ ] associated to the gelfand pairs @xmath85 .",
    "the objective of this paper is to follow the same program for general linear groups over finite fields ; unfortunately , in this setting , there are a lot of complications in comparison to the framework previously described .",
    "the naive idea is of course to replace partial permutations by _ partial isomorphisms _ ; but there are two major obstacles to this idea .    1 .   for permutations , if @xmath86 with @xmath68\\!\\right]}$ ] of size @xmath42 , then there is a unique canonical way to see @xmath53 as an element of @xmath58 ; as explained before , one leaves the integers outside @xmath43 fixed by @xmath53 .",
    "the same can not be done in a canonical way for isomorphisms : if @xmath87 is an @xmath4-isomorphism of a subspace @xmath88 of dimension @xmath42 , then @xmath87 admits a lot of extensions to isomorphisms of @xmath6 , related to the choice of complement subspaces of @xmath12 inside @xmath6 .",
    "and there is no reason or possibility to distinguish a particular extension among those . 2 .",
    "knowing that , a natural thing to do is to take the _",
    "mean of all possible extensions _ ; it seems then possible to define correctly the product of partial isomorphisms .",
    "but this still does not work : as we shall explain later ( see remark [ naive ] ) , the algebra that one obtains by this construction is not associative .",
    "the solution to these problems , and the main idea of this paper , is to define partial isomorphisms as _ pairs _ of isomorphisms between two subspaces .",
    "an alternative construction of partial bijections and partial isomorphisms has been proposed by g. olshanski in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath89 an inductive limit of finite groups , and @xmath90 a chain of subgroups of @xmath20 , such that @xmath91 commutes with @xmath92 for all @xmath2 .",
    "for instance one can take @xmath93\\!\\right]}}={\\mathrm{id}}_{{\\left[\\!\\left[}1 , n { \\right]\\!\\right]}}\\ } ; \\\\",
    "\\text{or}\\,\\,g(n)&={\\mathrm{gl}}(n,{\\mathbb{f}}_q)\\qquad;\\qquad k(n)=\\{g \\in { \\mathrm{gl}}(\\infty,{\\mathbb{f}}_q)\\,\\,|\\,\\,g_{|({\\mathbb{f}}_q)^n}={\\mathrm{id}}_{({\\mathbb{f}}_q)^n}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these situations , there is a structure of semigroup on the set of double cosets @xmath94 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath95 , @xmath96 can be identified with the set of bijections @xmath97 between two parts @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath98\\!\\right]}$ ] , and the product is @xmath99 notice that the product @xmath100 written above is quite different from the product of partial permutations defined in @xcite , or from the product of partial bijections defined in @xcite .",
    "a similar construction of semigroup can be performed when @xmath101 . however , these semigroups ( or the sets of double cosets @xmath102 , studied in okounkov s thesis @xcite ) , do not really help for the specific problem that we are looking at , namely , the understanding of the structure coefficients of the group algebra centers @xmath103 : indeed , there is no natural morphism of semigroups @xmath104 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not see how to use _ semigroup algebras _",
    "@xmath105 in order to construct a projective limit of the centers @xmath106 ; we shall however be satisfied with _ combinatorial algebras _",
    "labelled by partial isomorphisms , without an underlying structure of semigroup on the partial isomorphisms .      for finite general linear groups ,",
    "the conjugacy classes are given by jordan s reduction of matrices .",
    "if @xmath107 is a monic polynomial , its jordan matrix is the @xmath108 matrix @xmath109 call partition of size @xmath42 a non - increasing sequence of positive integers @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "a polypartition of size @xmath2 over the finite field @xmath4 is a family of partitions @xmath112 labelled by monic irreducible polynomials over @xmath4 , all different from @xmath113 , and such that @xmath114    to such a polypartition , we associate the block - diagonal matrix @xmath115 whose blocks are the jordan matrices @xmath116 with @xmath117\\!\\right]}$ ] and @xmath118\\!\\right]}$ ] . for instance , if @xmath119 , then @xmath120 jordan s reduction ensures that each conjugacy class of @xmath1 contains a unique matrix @xmath115 with @xmath121 polypartition of size @xmath2 over @xmath4 ; this result is a classical consequence of the classification of finitely generated modules over principal rings ( here , @xmath122 $ ] ) .",
    "thus , a linear basis of @xmath28 consists in the classes @xmath123 labelled by the set @xmath124 of these polypartitions .",
    "all the elements in @xmath123 have for characteristic and minimal polynomials @xmath125 on the other hand , it can be shown that [ cardinalconjugacy ] @xmath126 where @xmath127 ; @xmath128 is the pochhammer symbol @xmath129 ; and @xmath130 is the number of parts @xmath42 in a partition @xmath65 .",
    "this formula is proven by using hall s theory of modules over discrete valuation rings , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 2 , 4 ) .",
    "consider the @xmath131-polypartition @xmath132 a representative of this conjugacy class in @xmath133 is the jordan matrix @xmath134 and the cardinality of the class is @xmath135    for a polypartition @xmath121 of size @xmath136 , denote @xmath137 the polypartition of size @xmath2 obtained by adding parts @xmath45 to the partition @xmath138 .",
    "this amounts to complete matrices with @xmath45 s on the diagonal in the bottom right corner .",
    "therefore , our initial problem can be reformulated and generalized as follows :    fix two polypartitions @xmath139 and @xmath121 of size @xmath42 and @xmath47 .",
    "what is the expansion of @xmath140 in completed conjugacy classes @xmath141 in particular , what is the dependence in @xmath2 of the structure coefficients @xmath142",
    "?      denote @xmath143 the set @xmath20 endowed with the opposite of the product of the group @xmath20 ; @xmath144 is then an isomorphism of groups between @xmath20 and @xmath143",
    ". it will be extremely important in our discussion to see @xmath145 as the hecke algebra @xmath146 $ ]  this fact is true for every finite group @xmath20 .",
    "consider indeed the double action of @xmath20 and @xmath143 on @xmath147 given by @xmath148 these actions correspond to the injective maps @xmath149 let us detemine the orbit of an element @xmath150 under the action on the left by @xmath20 and on the right by @xmath143 .",
    "since one can multiply on the right by @xmath151 to obtain @xmath152 , the orbit depends only on @xmath153 .",
    "then , if @xmath152 and @xmath154 are in the same orbit , there exists @xmath155 such that @xmath156 thus , @xmath157 , and we have proved that the orbit of @xmath150 consists in pairs @xmath158 such that @xmath153 and @xmath159 are conjugated . for a conjugacy class @xmath160 of @xmath20 , denote @xmath161.\\ ] ] suppose that @xmath162",
    ". then , a simple computation allows one to check that @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the map @xmath164 & \\to { \\mathbb{z}}({\\mathbb{c}}g ) \\\\ c_{\\lambda } ' & \\mapsto c_{\\lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] realizes an isomorphism of commutative complex algebras .",
    "we are looking for a family of algebras @xmath165 with the following properties .",
    "we want them to form an inverse system of graded algebras @xmath166 so that in the end we will be able to look at the projective limit @xmath167 , which will allow us to make generic computations .",
    "then , we want these algebras to project onto the centers @xmath28 of the group algebras of the general linear groups over @xmath4 , so that these generic computations will turn into generic identities between conjugacy classes of isomorphisms .",
    "finally , we wish to construct the @xmath165 s in a fashion similar to @xcite , which is very combinatorial and natural .",
    "this means that we want to define the elements of @xmath165 as linear combinations of partial isomorphisms of @xmath6 , this notion staying for the moment vague and undefined .",
    "since @xmath168 can be seen as an hecke subalgebra of the algebra @xmath169 $ ] , the way to do it will be to do the same construction with algebras @xmath170 that project onto the group algebras @xmath169 $ ] . then , to obtain the @xmath165 s , we shall just look at invariant subalgebras of these @xmath170 s . our paper is therefore organized as follows :    * in section [ algpartiso ] , we define partial isomorphisms of @xmath6 and their product , and we prove that we obtain indeed an algebra @xmath170 ( theorem [ mainan ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty is to see that the product is associative ; this is related to the properties of certain linear operators on the algebra , and the associativity in @xmath170 is essentially equivalent to the commutativity of the algebra formed by these operators . * in section [ constructions ] , we look at some invariant subalgebras @xmath171 , and we prove that they form an inverse system of graded commutative algebras , that project onto the centers @xmath172 .",
    "we deduce from it the result of polynomiality of the structure coefficients that we have evoked in this introduction ; see our main theorem [ generalfh ] . *",
    "finally , in section [ secdegree1 ] , we give the table of multiplication of all elements of degree @xmath45 in the projective limit @xmath167 .",
    "this gives in particular a concrete answer to the first problem stated in this paper .",
    "we conclude this introduction by two important remarks .",
    "in essence , this paper relies only on linear algebra and combinatorics over finite fields .",
    "however , some of the results and proofs will be written using the language of probability : so , we shall speak freely of probability laws , conditional laws , markov chains , _",
    "etc_. , and we refer to @xcite for any detail on these notions .",
    "the reason is that the product of the algebra @xmath170 of partial isomorphisms that we shall study will be defined by taking averages of certain extensions of the partial isomorphisms .",
    "thus , discrete probability will provide in many situations a convenient way to describe and prove identities in @xmath170 .",
    "since we are only dealing with finite sets , for pure algebraists , every `` probabilistic '' statement can be replaced by a statement with a function on a finite set taking non - negative values that sum to @xmath45 .",
    "so probability is rather a commodity of language and a way of thinking than an absolute necessity in our reasonings .",
    "the reader may naturally ask what could be the uses of the theory of partial isomorphisms developed in this paper .",
    "we think of it as a first step in a much larger program , namely , the asymptotic representation theory of the finite general linear groups @xmath1  other important approaches appear in the papers @xcite . for symmetric groups @xmath58 , an important problem is to understand the asymptotic behavior of the random character value @xmath173 , where @xmath53 is a fixed permutation and @xmath174 is a random irreducible character of @xmath58 taken under some spectral measure , for instance the plancherel measure of the group .",
    "these random character values are important examples of random variables `` with a non - commutative flavour '' , and their asymptotic behavior is related to random matrix theory , exclusion processes of particules , free probability , and many other topics ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "the ivanov - kerov algebra of partial permutations has proven extremely useful in order to compute the moments of these random character values @xmath175 ; thus , they allowed to determine their asymptotic distribution .",
    "indeed , the computation of the moments @xmath176 $ ] is directly related to the computation of products and powers of conjugacy classes in symmetric group algebras .",
    "we refer in particular to @xcite , where such techniques and results are detailed .",
    "we hope to be able to follow the same program for finite linear groups @xmath177 .",
    "in particular , among the problems that we wish to solve after this paper , let us ask the following question .",
    "take the normalized trace @xmath178 of @xmath0 , which expands as linear combination of all irreducible normalized characters of the group : @xmath179 for @xmath87 fixed ( say , @xmath87 is a diagonal matrix @xmath29 ) and completed by @xmath45 s on the diagonal , we consider @xmath180 as a random variable under the probability measure @xmath181=\\frac{(\\dim v^{\\bblambda})^{2}}{{\\mathrm{card}}\\ , { \\mathrm{gl}}(n,{\\mathbb{f}}_{q})},\\ ] ] which is the plancherel measure of the group .",
    "what are the asymptotics of the law of @xmath182 ? to compute the moments of @xmath183 amounts to compute the powers of @xmath184 in the group algebras @xmath106 , where @xmath121 is the conjugacy class of @xmath87 ; whence the interest of our results for the asymptotic analysis of the random character values @xmath183 . the idea would then be to use these observables @xmath183 to get a better understanding of the properties of asymptotic concentration of the measures @xmath185 ; in particular , one should be able to recover this way the results of @xcite .      to help the reader",
    "keep track of the notations , and of the various characters appearing as exponents or indices throughout the paper , we have listed hereafter the conventions that we shall use , see the following table . on the other hand , we recall the pochhammer symbol @xmath186 . in the following",
    "we shall try to write every enumeration as a polynomial in @xmath3 and in these pochhammer symbols in @xmath187 .",
    "@xmath188    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     @xmath188 where by number of elements we mean the image by the linear map @xmath189 , or by the linear map @xmath190 .",
    "most manipulations are eased by dealing with the normalized versions of classes ( those with a @xmath191 ) .",
    "[ ziscommutative ]",
    "the algebra @xmath165 is commutative .",
    "ultimately the result comes from the commutativity of all the algebras @xmath192 with @xmath12 subspace of @xmath6 , but the verifications are not obvious at all . on the other hand , we really need to do them in order to obtain a formula for the product of two classes @xmath193 and @xmath194 ; so we can not skip this proof of commutativity .",
    "take two random independent subspaces @xmath12 and @xmath14 of dimension @xmath42 and @xmath47 inside @xmath6 .",
    "the law of @xmath195 is the case @xmath196 of lemma [ complicateproba ] : @xmath197 = q^{(k+l - m)(m - n)}\\,\\frac{(q^{-1})_{n - k}\\,(q^{-1})_{n - l}\\,(q^{-1})_{k}\\,(q^{-1})_{l}}{(q^{-1})_{k+l - m}\\,(q^{-1})_{n - m}\\,(q^{-1})_{n}\\,(q^{-1})_{m - k}\\,(q^{-1})_{m - l}}.\\ ] ] then , since the law of the pair @xmath198 is invariant by action by @xmath1 , @xmath199 is a random subspace with a law invariant by @xmath1 , so its law is a mixture of the uniform laws on random subspaces of fixed dimension @xmath200 .",
