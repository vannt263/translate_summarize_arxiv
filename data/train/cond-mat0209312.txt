    "the genomes of a number of organisms are already known and more are being completed at a rate of perhaps one a month .",
    "once a genome @xcite has been sequenced the amino - acid sequences of _ all _ its proteins are known .",
    "the complete set of proteins of an organism is generally referred to as its proteome .",
    "here we use genome data for _ e. coli _ to systematically estimate the change in the interactions of all the proteins of this bacterium when the salt concentration is varied .",
    "_ e. coli _ can grow in environments with a very wide range of salt concentrations @xcite , and so its proteins must function _ in vivo _ over a wide range of salt concentrations .",
    "the potassium ion concentration inside the cell can vary from approximately @xmath1 to @xmath2 mm @xcite ; potassium is the predominant cation in living cells .",
    "clearly , the proteins must remain soluble over this range , and they should bind to the other proteins which they are required to bind to in order to function , but they should not interact strongly with other proteins .",
    "the study of a proteome is often called proteomics . here , as the physical properties of proteins are studied ( as opposed to their chemical properties such as catalytic function )",
    "we are doing what may be called physical proteomics .",
    "there has been extensive theoretical work on the salt dependence of the interactions in individual proteins , particularly for the protein lysozyme @xcite .",
    "see refs .   for corresponding experimental work",
    ". however , as far as the author is aware , this is the first attempt to characterise the interactions of _ all _ the proteins of an organism .",
    "we will consider the proteins separately , i.e. , as single component solutions .",
    "of course inside a bacterium the proteins exist as a mixture of thousands of components .",
    "future work will consider multi - component mixtures of the proteins .",
    "we have chosen _",
    "e. coli _ as it is a bacterium , and therefore a relatively simple organism , and as it has been extensively studied .",
    "however , the distribution of charges on the proteins of almost all organisms is very similar and so our results apply to almost all organisms , including _ h.",
    "sapiens_. the only exceptions are some extremophiles @xcite .    in the next section we use genome data to estimate the charges on the proteins of _",
    "e. coli_. this data is used in the third section where we calculate the variation in their second virial coefficients as the salt concentration is varied .",
    "the last section is a conclusion .",
    "_ e. coli k-12 _ has a proteome of 4358 proteins .",
    "the amino acid sequences of all of them are known from the sequencing of its genome @xcite .",
    "_ k-12 _ is the name of a strain of _",
    "e. coli_. runcong and mitaku have analysed the charge distributions of a number of organisms using a simple approximate method of estimating the charge on a protein at neutral ph from its amino - acid sequence @xcite .",
    "we will follow their analysis but use a slightly different approximation for the charge on a protein with a given amino - acid sequence .    of the 20 amino acids , 5 have pk values such",
    "that they should be at least partially charged at neutral ph @xcite .",
    "these are two highly acidic amino acids , aspartic acid and glutamic acid , two highly basic amino acids , lysine and arginine and one somewhat basic amino acid , histidine .",
    "aspartic and glutamic acids have pk s far below 7 and lysine and arginine have pk s far above 7 and so we assume that all 4 of these amino acids are fully charged at neutral ph .",
    "aspartic and glutamic acids then each contribute @xmath3 to the charge on a protein , and lysine and arginine each contribute @xmath4 .",
    "histidine has a pk of around 6 - 6.5 ( this will depend on the environment of the amino acid ) .",
    "the equation for the fraction @xmath5 of a basic group such as histidine that is charged at a given ph is @xmath6 where pk is the pk value for the basic group .",
    "this equation is just the henderson - hasselbalch equation @xcite rearranged .",
    "taking pk@xmath7 @xcite and at ph=7 we have that the fraction of histidines charged is @xmath8 . as this is small",
    "we assume for simplicity that all the histidine amino acids are uncharged .",
    "thus , with these assumptions for the charges on these 5 amino acids , our estimate for the net charge @xmath9 on a protein is simply given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the the protein s total numbers of lysines , arginines , aspartic acids and glutamic acids , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath15 , @xmath16 etc .",
    "correspond to the standard single letter codes for the amino acids @xcite .",
    "the charge @xmath9 is in units of @xmath17 where @xmath17 is the elementary charge .",
    "note that runcong and mitaku @xcite assume that the histidine amino acids contribute @xmath4 to the charge , that is the only difference between our analysis and that of runcong and mitaku .",
    "as the histidine amino acid is quite a rare amino acid , approximately 1 in 50 amino acids is a histidine , the difference between the results we obtain and those of runcong and mitaku @xcite is not large but our charges are shifted to more negative values . using runcong and mitaku s approximation the mean charge on a protein is @xmath18 units more positive than the mean charge we find here . as a check on our algorithm , we can compare the prediction of equation ( [ qdef ] ) for chicken lysozyme to that of a titration experiment to determine the charge .",
    "equation ( [ qdef ] ) predicts that chicken lysozyme @xcite has a net charge of 8 at neutral ph .",
    "titration experiments on lysozyme give a titratable charge of close to @xmath19 at ph=7 @xcite .",
    "using equation ( [ qdef ] ) we can obtain estimates for the charges of all 4358 proteins of _ e. coli _ @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ qcoli ] , where we have plotted the number of proteins @xmath20 as a function of net charge @xmath9 .",
    "the distribution is centered almost at a net charge @xmath21 , and for not - too - large @xmath22 the distribution is roughly symmetric and gaussian .",
    "the mean charge is @xmath23 .",
    "given the approximate nature of our equation for the charge on a protein , equation ( [ qdef ] ) , the data is probably consistent with a mean charge of 0 .",
    "the approximation scheme of mitaku and runcong @xcite yields a mean charge of @xmath24 .",
    "also , although when @xmath22 is not too large the distribution can be seen to be reasonably symmetric , _ e. coli _ has 12 proteins with charges @xmath25 but none with charges @xmath26 . excluding proteins with very large charges , @xmath27 , the root mean square charge equals @xmath28 .",
    "a number of other organisms , both other bacteria and eukaryotes such as yeast , have had the charge distribution on their proteomes determined by runcong and mitaku @xcite and by the author @xcite .",
    "almost all of them have a roughly gaussian distribution centered approximately at zero , like the distribution in fig .  [ qcoli ] .",
    "the exceptions are some extremophiles .",
    "extremophiles are organisms that live in extreme environments , for example _ halobacterium sp .",
    "_ lives in environments with very high levels of salt @xcite .",
    "the cytosol of _ halobacterium sp . _ contains much higher levels of potassium ions than do other organisms so perhaps it is not a surprise that the distribution of charges on its proteins is different .",
    "we have fitted the gaussian function @xmath29 to the data for the number of proteins as a function of their charge .",
    "it is drawn as the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ qcoli ] .",
    "the fit parameters are mean charge @xmath30 and standard deviation @xmath31 .",
    "1739 is @xmath32 and so the distribution is normalised so that its integral gives the total number of proteins . within a couple of standard deviations of the mean the gaussian function fits the data well but it underestimates the numbers of proteins with charges such that @xmath33 is several times the standard deviation .",
    "we also note that there is a correlation between the net charge @xmath9 on a protein and its size , measured by the number of amino acids @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ scat_coli ] is a scatter plot of charge @xmath9 and number of amino acids @xmath34 for the proteins of _",
    "e. coli_. although at any particular size @xmath34 there is a wide distribution of charges , on average the more highly charged proteins are larger than average .",
    "we expect the volume of a protein to scale with @xmath34 .",
    "consider a dilute solution of a single one of the proteins of _",
    "e. coli_. apart from water , the only other constituents are a 1:1 salt at a concentration @xmath35 and a buffer which controls the ph while making a negligible contribution to the ionic strength . here",
    "we will always assume the ph=7 but other ph s can be considered if the net charges on the proteins can be calculated .",
    "also , the counterions of the protein are assumed the same as either the anions or cations of the salt , depending on the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "the interactions between the protein molecules in the salt solution can be characterised by means of the protein s second virial coefficient @xmath36 : a function of temperature , ph and salt concentration .",
    "proteins are complex molecules and we are unable to calculate from first principles the absolute value of @xmath36 for any of the 4358 proteins possessed by _",
    "e. coli_. however , predicting the change in the second virial coefficient when the salt concentration varies is a much easier problem , _ if _ we assume that changing the salt concentration changes only the direct electrostatic interaction between the net charges of a protein .",
    "this is a strong assumption but studies of the simple protein lysozyme have shown that the variation of its second virial coefficient can be described using a simple model which only includes its net charge @xcite .",
    "here we will follow warren @xcite and apply his analysis of lysozyme to the complete set of proteins of _",
    "e. coli_. we will discuss which proteins are likely to be less well described by this theory than is lysozyme .    a protein molecule of charge @xmath9",
    "is surrounded by its counterions and as the concentration of the protein is increased so is the counterion density .",
    "this increase in the counterion density decreases the translational entropy of the counterions and this contributes a positive amount to the second virial coefficient .",
    "see warren @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "@xmath36 has the form @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an assumed constant term due to excluded volume interactions and other interactions which are insensitive to salt concentration .",
    "the second term is from the counterions and the salt .",
    "it is quadratic in the charge and so of course is zero for uncharged proteins and is independent of the sign of the net charge on a protein .",
    "as stated above we are unable to calculate the absolute value of @xmath36 ; the values of @xmath38 of the proteins are unknown .",
    "however , we can calculate the difference in @xmath36 when the salt concentration is changed from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "it is @xmath41 this is easy to calculate for any protein and in fig .",
    "[ db2 ] we have plotted the number of proteins @xmath20 as a function of the change in their second virial coefficient , @xmath42 , when the salt concentration is decreased from 1 m to @xmath0 m .",
    "the results are given in units of nm@xmath43 .",
    "for comparison the volume of a typical bacterial protein is about 60nm@xmath43 and so if a protein were to interact solely via a hard repulsion it would have a second virial coefficient of about 4 times its volume or about 240nm@xmath43 .",
    "results for proteins with @xmath44 are shown .",
    "proteins with larger titratable charges are likely to have an effective charge lower than @xmath9 , see refs .   and references therein . from the linear poisson - boltzmann equation , the potential ( divided by @xmath17 ) at the surface of a spherical particle with charge @xmath9 and",
    "radius @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the bjerrum length , and and @xmath48 is the debye screening length , given by @xmath49 . for the dielectric constant of water 80 times that in vacuum and at room temperature , @xmath50 nm . globular proteins are approximately spherical and typically have radii around 2 to 4 nm .",
    "taking a protein with a radius of 3 nm , in salt at a concentration @xmath51 m , we have that for @xmath52 , the potential at the surface is about @xmath53 .",
    "larger charges correspond to larger surface potentials and these large potentials bind oppositely charged ions to the surface reducing the effective charge . on average",
    ", this effect will be diminished to a certain extent by the fact that the most highly charged proteins are larger than average .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ scat_coli ] , where it is clear that the charge and size of a protein are correlated .",
    "recent simulations by lobaskin _",
    "_ @xcite of spheres with radius 2 nm and charge @xmath54 in the absence of salt found an effective charge of a little under @xmath55 .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves to proteins with charges of magnitude less than or equal to 30 .",
    "4300 of the 4358 proteins , or almost 99% , have charges in this range .",
    "the mean change in @xmath36 of these 4300 proteins when the salt concentration is decreased from 1 to @xmath0 m is 139nm@xmath43 and the standard deviation is 218nm@xmath43 .    a couple of caveats .",
    "the first is that the effect of salt on protein solutions is known to depend not only on whether the salt is a 1:1 salt , a 1:2 salt etc . but also to the nature of ions , whether it is mg@xmath56 or ca@xmath56 for example @xcite .",
    "our generic theory applies only where there are no specific interactions between the salt and the protein .",
    "there is good agreement between experiment and theory for lysozyme plus nacl @xcite and so we may hope that it applies to nacl and many proteins but it clearly misses potentially important effects for other salts where there are specific protein - salt interactions .",
    "the second is that proteins are not simple charged spheres , for example some have large dipole moments .",
    "dipoles exert net attractions which are screened and hence weakened by added salt .",
    "thus proteins with a small charges but large dipole moments are poorly described by the current theory : if the dipole interactions are dominant then the second virial coefficient may even increase when the salt concentration is increased .",
    "@xcite discuss this point . note that although we can estimate the charge on a protein from its amino - acid sequence we can not estimate its dipole moment without knowing its three - dimensional structure , and so the sequence data from genomics is not adequate to determine dipole moments .",
    "here we have shown how data from genomics can be used to estimate the charges on the proteins of an organism .",
    "we then used these charges to estimate the changes in the second virial coefficients of 4300 ( 99% ) of the proteins of _ e. coli _ when the salt concentration is changed . note that _",
    "e. coli _ can survive and multiply in external environments with a very wide range of salt concentrations ; cayley _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the growth of _",
    "e. coli _ in environments with salt concentrations ranging from very low to @xmath57 molar , corresponding to potassium ion concentrations inside the cell of @xmath1 to @xmath2 mm @xcite .",
    "thus , studying the change in interactions of proteins with salt concentration is of direct relevance to the _ in vivo _ behaviour of proteins . within molecular biology",
    "there is a clear shift of emphasis away from studying the proteins of an organism one or a few at a time , and towards determining the structure and function of large sets of proteins , in particular proteomes .",
    "the systematic study of these large sets of proteins is often called proteomics .",
    "this work is a first attempt to keep up with this shift by performing a simple theoretical calculation of a solution phase physical property for a complete proteome , rather than for one or a handful of proteins as is usually done .",
    "it may be termed physical proteomics .",
    ".the charged macromolecular species in the cytosol of _ e. coli_. the data is from neidhardt @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is the charge on a macromolecule . for proteins",
    "the range given is the mean plus and minus twice the standard deviation .",
    "@xmath20 is the total number of molecules of a species per cell . the volume of an _",
    "e. coli _ cell is about @xmath58m@xmath43 so 1 molecule per cell corresponds to a concentration of about @xmath59 molar .",
    "a prokaryote ribosome consists of about 4500 bases of rna plus protein .",
    "the ribosomal proteins are mostly quite stongly positively charged and so will decrease the net negative charge . as a rough estimate we settle on a net charge of @xmath60 .",
    "the charge on a trna molecule is around @xmath61 , @xmath3 from each of its bases @xcite .",
    "the charge on a mrna molecule is on average around @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the charge on dna is equal to twice the number of base pairs , 4,639,221 for _ e. coli k-12 _ @xcite .",
    "the charge density from the proteins assumes that the proteins have the mean charge of @xmath63 that they would have if their density and charge were uncorrelated .",

    "this is quite small .",

    "see refs .   for an introduction to the proteins , dna and rna .",
    "although for every molecule of trna molecule there are 10 of protein , for every ribosome there are 100 molecules of protein , and for every mrna there are 1000 molecules of protein , the contributions of the trna , ribosomes , dna and proteins , to the overall charge density of the macromolecules are very roughly comparable . the ribosomes contribute the largest amount . the macromolecules",
    "are negatively charged and this negative charge is balanced by potassium ions @xcite .",
