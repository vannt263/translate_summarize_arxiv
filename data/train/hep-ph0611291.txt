    "energy is directly related to the mass of the top quark . assuming a total integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath4 , lc simulations of a threshold scan of the top - antitop total cross section",
    "have demonstrated that experimental uncertainties below 100  mev for the top - quark mass determination can be obtained  @xcite , even when beam effects , which lead to some smearing of the effective c.m .",
    "energy , are taken into account .",
    "if the normalization of the cross section line shape is well under control , it is possible to determine the strong coupling , the total top quark width and , if the higgs boson is light , the top yukawa coupling . in view of the accuracy obtainable at the lc",
    "the theoretical uncertainties for the total cross section should be lowered to a level of a few percent  @xcite",
    ". a precise knowledge of the top mass would also improve the analysis of electroweak precision observables and put indirect constraints on new physics .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that an accuracy of 100  mev on the top quark mass would allow to perform stringent internal consistency checks of the sm and of some scenarios of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "threshold studies would also be feasible for squarks at a next lc .",
    "many models of susy predict that , due to large mixing , the lightest squark could correspond to one of the mass eigenstates of the third generation with @xmath5 gev , thus allowing for the production of stop pairs at a future @xmath0 lc operating below 1 tev .",
    "a `` threshold scan '' of the total cross section line - shape at such a facility will yield precise measurements of the stop mass , lifetime and couplings  @xcite , in close analogy to the program carried out in threshold studies for the top - antitop threshold  @xcite .",
    "close to threshold the top quark pairs are produced with small velocities @xmath6 in the c.m .",
    "therefore the relevant physical scales governing the top - antitop dynamics are the top quark mass @xmath7 , the relative three - momentum @xmath8 and the top quark nonrelativistic kinetic energy @xmath9 .",
    "since the ratios of the three scales can arise in matrix elements , the cross section can not be calculated using the standard qcd expansion in the strong coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the best known indication of the latter comes from the well - known  coulomb singularity \" , which shows up as a singular @xmath11 behaviour in the @xmath12 limit of the @xmath2 production amplitude at the @xmath13-loop order in perturbative qcd .",
    "the proper expansion scheme for the @xmath2 threshold region is a double expansion in both @xmath10 and @xmath14 , and one has to use the parametric counting @xmath15 to identify all effects contributing to a certain order of approximation . in this",
    "_ fixed - order _ expansion the leading order ( lo ) contributions correspond to terms in the total cross section proportional to @xmath16 , @xmath17 , next - to - leading ( nlo ) terms are proportional to @xmath18 $ ] and so on . at",
    "lo the total cross section is proportional to the absorptive part of the green function of a schrdinger equation containing the static qcd - potential  @xcite .",
    "higher order corrections in this expansion are rigorously implemented employing the concept of nonrelativistic effective quantum field theories , first proposed by caswell and lepage  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the original qcd lagrangian is reformulated in terms of an effective nonrelativistic lagrangian called  nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics \" ( nrqcd ) by using the hierarchy @xmath19 , which allows to separate short - distance physics at the  hard \" scale of order the heavy quark mass from long - distance physics at the nonrelativistic scales @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the hard - momentum effects are encoded as wilson coefficients of the operators in the effective lagrangian .",
    "operators with increasing dimension are introduced in the effective theory to include the effects of higher orders in the nonrelativistic expansion , but only a finite number is needed for a given precision .",
    "the nrqcd factorization properties were used in a number of nnlo calculations  @xcite of the total @xmath2 production cross section .",
    "a common feature of the _ fixed - order _ calculations is that the running from the hard scale @xmath22 down to the nonrelativistic scales was not taken into account . at nnlo nrqcd matrix elements and",
    "wilson coefficients involve logarithms of ratios of the hard scale and the nonrelativistic scales , which in the case of top quark pair production close to threshold can be sizeable ( for example @xmath23\\simeq 0.8 $ ] for @xmath24 ) . considering the parametric counting",
    "@xmath25 introduces a modified expansion scheme for the size of the terms contributing to the total cross section , where the dominant contribution , proportional to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is called leading - logarithmic order ( ll ) . a number of different versions of nrqcd  @xcite , each of which aiming ( in principle ) on applications in different physical situations , allow for renormalization group improved calculations ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews on the field ) .",
    "the eft vnrqcd ( `` velocity''nrqcd )  @xcite has been designed for predictions at the @xmath28 threshold .",
    "it treats the case @xmath29 , i.e. all physical scales are perturbative , but also has the correlation @xmath30 built in at the field theoretical level .",
    "qcd effects for the @xmath2 total cross section up to the nnll order computed in this framework  @xcite significantly reduce the size and scale dependence to yield a 6@xmath31 theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the scalar version of vnrqcd , which describes the nonrelativistic interaction between pairs of colored scalars and provides the needed ingredients for a summation of qcd effects at nll order , has been given recently  @xcite .",
    "up to now , no systematic and complete treatment of electroweak effects in the total cross section for top quark pair production has been achieved beyond the lo approximation .",
    "the large top width , being of the same order than the nonrelativistic energy , is essential in the description of the @xmath2 threshold dynamics .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that in the nonrelativistic limit the top - quark width can be consistently implemented by the replacement @xmath32 in the results for the total cross section for stable top quarks .",
    "although this replacement rule can accommodate some of the nlo and nnlo electroweak corrections , a coherent treatment at the conceptual level requires the use of an extended nrqcd effective theory formalism .    in the nrqcd / vnrqcd framework",
    "as long as one is not interested in any differential information of the top decay , finite lifetime corrections to the total cross section can be regarded as short - distance information to be encoded in the wilson coefficients of the nrqcd lagrangian and the nrqcd currents . as the particles involved in the electroweak corrections",
    "can be lighter than the top quark they can lead to nonzero imaginary parts in the matching conditions .",
    "these electroweak absorptive parts render the nrqcd lagrangian non - hermitian , but the total cross section can still be obtained from the imaginary part of the @xmath33 forward scattering amplitude by virtue of the optical theorem and the unitarity of the underlying theory , in complete analogy to the treatment of the inelastic processes in quantum mechanics where particle decay and absorption are implemented through potentials with complex coefficients .",
    "an important feature of the effective theory treatment of electroweak effects is that resonant and non - resonant contributions in nrqcd amplitudes can be systematically separated if the scaling relation @xmath34 is used .",
    "the latter is justified because numerically the top width is approximately equal to the typical top kinetic energy @xmath35 . including the non - resonant background diagrams leading to the same final states as those of top decay in the matching calculations",
    "is necessary in order to maintain gauge invariance .    in this approach the nnll",
    "matching conditions accounting for the absorptive parts related to the @xmath36 final state were derived in  @xcite and shown to amount numerically to several percent .",
    "a very interesting new conceptual aspect of these corrections is that they have uv divergences that arise from the high energy behaviour of the @xmath2 effective theory phase space integration .",
    "the phase - space in the full theory is cut - off by the large top mass , but it extends to infinity in nrqcd where we have taken the limit @xmath37  .",
    "the divergences show up only when @xmath38 , as a finite width generates a distribution for the top invariant mass and thus allows for arbitrary large momenta in the nonrelativistic phase space integration .",
    "similar divergences had already been noted in the qcd nnll relativistic corrections to the @xmath39-wave zero distance green function if the unstable propagator was used  @xcite as well as in the leading order @xmath40-wave zero distance green function which accounts for @xmath2 production through the z - exchange  @xcite .",
    "the nnll divergences renormalize @xmath41 operators that contribute to the total cross section through the imaginary parts of their wilson coefficients .",
    "the running induced in these wilson coefficients by the divergences thus represents a nll effect to the total cross section  @xcite but their matching conditions at the hard scale are presently unknown .",
    "scalar particles are produced at leading order in the nonrelativistic expansion in a @xmath40-wave state . in these systems",
    "the phase - space divergences constitute a more severe problem as they show up already in the leading order green s function .",
    "a phenomenologically well motivated example is pair production of susy partners of the quarks at threshold , which has been studied at lo in several works  @xcite using a semi - phenomenological solution in order to deal with the phase - space uv divergences .",
    "there are a number of issues concerning the consistent formulation of nonrelativistic interpolating currents which describe color singlet heavy quark - antiquark and squark - antisquark pair production for general quantum numbers in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "these involve in particular the generalization of spherical harmonics in @xmath13 spatial dimensions and the role of evanescent operator structures ( _ i.e. _ that vanish as @xmath43 ) for the description of the nonrelativistic spin .",
    "the latter have been addressed in detail in a recent work  @xcite and we briefly comment on them here .",
    "let us discuss first the spin singlet currents with arbitrary angular momentum @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the generic structure of the production currents with total spin zero is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 represents an arbitrary tensor depending on the c.m.momentum label @xmath20 and @xmath48 .",
    "the interpolating currents associated to a definite angular momentum state @xmath44 are related to irreducible representations of the tensor @xmath49 with respect to the rotation group so(n ) .",
    "the irreducible tensors are up to normalization just the spherical harmonics @xmath50 of degree @xmath44 , with @xmath51 , that form an orthogonal basis of a @xmath52-dimensional space with @xmath53 .",
    "a representation in terms of cartesian coordinates of the spherical harmonics of degree @xmath44 is given by the totally symmetric and traceless tensors with @xmath44 indices @xmath54 , where the indices @xmath55 are cartesian coordinates : @xmath56 and which satisfy the eigenvalue equation for the squared angular momentum operator @xmath57 .",
    "the currents with angular momenta s , p and d are _",
    "e.g. _ relevant in the electromagnetic production of colored scalars from @xmath0 and @xmath58 collisions .",
    "the use of the generalized currents built from ( [ tdef ] ) is mandatory to obtain consistent results in dimensional regularization in accordance with so(n ) rotational invariance .",
    "an instructive example regarding the computation of the nonrelativistic three - loop vacuum polarization diagram with two insertions of the coulomb potential is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interpolating currents describing the production of a fermion - antifermion pair in a spin triplet @xmath59 state for arbitrary @xmath44 ( @xmath60 ) requires the treatment of pauli @xmath61-matrices in @xmath13-dimensions .",
    "the @xmath61-matrices @xmath62 are the generators of so(n ) rotations for spin 1/2 and satisfy the euclidean clifford algebra @xmath63 . as for the case of the @xmath64-matrices",
    "@xcite products of @xmath61-matrices in arbitrary number of dimensions can not be reduced to a finite basis , but represent an infinite set of independent structures , which can be choosen as the antisymmetrized product of @xmath61 matrices : @xmath65}\\,,\\;m=0,1,2,\\ldots$ ] for @xmath66 the @xmath67 are related to physical spin operators , with eigenvalues of @xmath68 equal to @xmath69 , which reduce to the known @xmath70 values .",
    "the @xmath71 operators are evanescent for @xmath72 ( although their spin eigenvalues are non - zero ) .",
    "s - wave currents in an arbitrary spin state thus have the form @xmath73 , and can arise in important processes .",
    "the structure @xmath74 for example arises in fermion pair production in @xmath58 collisions , while the evanescent operator @xmath75 is present in the @xmath76 annihilation amplitude .",
    "note that the differences between the two different singlet ( @xmath77 ) and triplet ( @xmath78 ) currents correspond to evanescent operators as well .",
    "it is well known from subleading order computations based on the effective weak hamiltonian that one needs to consistently account for the evanescent operator structures that arise in matrix elements of physical operators when being dressed with gluons .",
    "a renormalization scheme can be adopted such that a mixing of evanescent operators into physical ones does not arise  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is also known  @xcite that modifications of the evanescent operator basis correspond to a change of the renormalization scheme . while this does not affect physical predictions , it does affect matrix elements , matching conditions and anomalous dimensions at nontrivial subleading order .",
    "thus precise definitions of the schemes being used have to be given to render such intermediate results useful .    in the framework of the nonrelativistic eft these properties still apply . however , using the velocity power counting in the eft allows for even more specific statements . concerning interactions through potentials ,",
    "transitions between the different s - wave currents built from @xmath67 can not occur because the potentials are so(n ) scalars and the currents are inequivalent irreducible representations of so(n ) . even for currents with @xmath79 and for",
    "the spin - dependent spin - orbit and tensor potentials ( which is all we need to consider at nnll order ) one can show that transitions between currents containing @xmath67 with a different number of indices can not occur  @xcite .",
    "the same arguments apply to the exchange of soft gluons in vnrqcd . concerning the exchange of ultrasoft gluons ,",
    "transitions between currents containing @xmath67 with a different number of indices can arise , but only if the interaction is spin - dependent .",
    "the dominant among these interactions corresponds to the operator @xmath80 and can only contribute at n@xmath81ll order , which is beyond the present need and technical capabilities .",
    "so for the s - wave currents in @xmath13 dimensions one can employ either one of the two spin singlet ( @xmath77 ) or triplet currents ( @xmath78 ) in the eft and the difference corresponds to a change in the renormalization scheme .",
    "this means in particular that as long as the renormalization process is restricted to time - ordered products of the currents , one can freely use three - dimensional relations to reduce the basis of the physical currents .",
    "however , once the basis of the physical currents is fixed , one has to consistently apply the computational rules in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "moreover , one can also conclude that currents containing evanescent @xmath67 matrices ( @xmath71 ) can be safely dropped from the beginning as long as one does not need to account for spin - dependent ultrasoft gluon interactions .    based on the latter considerations it is straightforward to construct spin - triplet currents with arbitrary @xmath44 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "they can be obtained  @xcite by determining irreducible so(n ) representations from products of the tensors @xmath54 describing angular momentum @xmath44 and the spin - triplet @xmath59 currents discussed previously .",
    "as for the case of the s - wave currents the physical basis for arbitrary spatial angular momentum is not unique due to the existence of evanescent operator structures .",
    "it is possible  @xcite to construct currents with fully symmetric indices equal to the total angular momentum @xmath82 by using the two spin triplet operators , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "there are also currents having more than @xmath82 indices , which transform according to more complicated patterns of so(n ) .",
    "they become equivalent in @xmath70 to the fully symmetric currents  @xcite and are also appropriate to describe production of @xmath60 states .",
    "the nll anomalous dimensions of the currents with arbitrary spin and angular momentum configurations have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . since at ll order the currents are not renormalized , their nll order anomalous dimensions are independent of the scheme used for the currents or the potentials .",
    "the nll running found for the currents shows a suppression @xmath85 , which suggests that the summation of logarithms of @xmath14 for the production and annihilation rates of high angular momentum states is less significant .",
