    "entanglement is highly relevant to the fundamental issues of quantum mechanics and plays a central role in the application of quantum information @xcite . in recent years",
    ", it has been observed that two qubits interacting with independent reservoirs experience disentanglement in a finite time in spite of the asymptotical decoherence .",
    "the corresponding investigations for this phenomenon , called entanglement sudden death ( esd ) , give notable results both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . nevertheless , most of previous works concentrate on the dynamical evolution of a bipartite system , while the understanding of how the information is transferred is to be explored in depth , especially for non - markovian environment .",
    "recently , people begin to analyze the dynamics of an extended system which incorporates two qubits and their respective reservoirs and successfully explain the process of information transmission in markovian regime @xcite .",
    "thanks to these significant improvements and using the non - perturbative method @xcite , we extend the study of this composite system into non - markovian regime where the reservoir presents some internal structure .",
    "first of all , we study the entanglement dynamics of two atoms and two reservoirs .",
    "expectedly , when the atom entanglement is depleted permanently , it is completely transferred to the reservoir entanglement irrespective of the non - markovian memory effect .",
    "the reservoir entanglement can not only exhibit entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) but also esd .",
    "surprisingly , the revival of atom entanglement @xcite is not always accompanied by the disentanglement of reservoirs , and vice versa .",
    "entanglement of atom pairs can revive before , simultaneously or even after the esd of reservoirs and these phenomena are independent of the relative strength of atom - reservoir interaction .",
    "in addition , we analyze the effective bipartite entanglement and multipartite entanglement within the system and thus give a comprehensive interpretation of the information transmission in non - markovian regime . applying the population analysis for the excited atomic state , we present quantitative criteria , which have been left obscure for quite a long time , of the occurrence and exact numbers for revivals of atom entanglement and death of reservoir entanglement .",
    "our analytic and numerical analysis enables one to precisely manipulate the entanglement based on the atoms or / and quantum dots in high q cavities @xcite and thus have potential importance in application .    finally , by transforming the true mode hamiltonian @xcite to the quasimode form @xcite which explicitly separates the memory effect and the damping effect of the reservoir , we give a more physically intuitive insight into the non - markovian phenomena .",
    "under the rotating wave approximation , the truemode hamiltonian of the single - body system ( atom and its reservoir ) is ( @xmath0 ) @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2    here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the atom , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode of the reservoir with the eigenfrequency @xmath7 .    for an initial state of the form",

    "the equations for the probability amplitudes take the forms @xmath14 @xmath15 eliminating the coefficients @xmath16 by integrating ( [ eq3 ] ) and substituting the result into ( [ eq2 ] ) , one yields @xmath17 where the correlation function takes the form @xmath18 suppose the atom interacting resonantly with the reservoir with lorentzian spectral density @xmath19,\\ ] ] by employing fourier transform and residue theorem , we get the explicit form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the transition strength and the quantity @xmath22 is the reservoir correlation time .    to construct a concrete physical insight , we adopt a nonperturbative method called pseudomode approach @xcite in the following analysis . equation ( [ eq8 ] ) can be restated as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pseudomode amplitude .",
    "typically , there are two regimes @xcite : weak - coupling regime ( @xmath26 ) , where the behavior of the single - body system is markovian and irreversible decay occurs , and strong - coupling regime ( @xmath27 ) , where non - markovian dynamics occurs accompanied by an oscillatory reversible decay and a structured rather than a flat reservoir situation applies .",
    "we will limit our considerations to the latter case .",
    "define the normalized collective excited state of the reservoir as @xmath28 one can rewrite ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30,\\ ] ] with @xmath31 .",
    "we note that @xmath32 , @xmath33 which can be calculated directly from the definition ( [ eqdef ] ) and @xmath34 the atom and its reservoir now evolve as an effective two - qubit system .",
    "now , we study the joint evolution of two identical single - body systems initially in the global state @xmath35 where the real non - negative parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the @xmath39th single - body system .",
    "the evolution of the composite system reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the single - body evolution and can be determined by ( [ eq4 ] ) . employing the density matrix @xmath43 and the definition of concurrence @xcite",

    "similar to the markovian case @xcite , atom entanglement vanishes permanently after a finite time , while reservoir entanglement presents sudden birth and death even without the revival of atom entanglement , which is totally different from the markovian case where reservoir entanglement just increases monotonically up to a stationary value .",
    "according to ( b ) and ( c ) , the revival of atom entanglement does not necessarily indicate the sudden death of reservoir entanglement , and vice versa .    besides these distinctive non - markovian behaviors",

    "this means the information is transferred from two reservoirs to each subsystem and then to two atoms .",
    "this depletion - feedback process continues for some time with a damping of amplitudes because the memory effect is finite and the atoms will decay inevitably .    entanglement for other partitions is shown in figure [ pic3 ]",

    "the particular conversion relations are given in the appendix in @xcite .",
    "analogous to the procedure in section ii , the evolution of the single - body system is @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "this means the pseudomode in section ii is just the discrete quasimode and the quasimodes ( both discrete and continuum ) are our previous reservoir .",
    "we plot the time evolution of the population in figure [ pic4 ] and explain how the memory effect and damping effect induce @xmath132 to perform damped oscillations .",

    "if we let the atom and the discrete mode be a new system and the continuum modes be the external environment , the behavior of the new system will be exactly markovian .",
    "therefore , transmission of the exciton from atom to reservoir is a two - step process : first , a photon is created in a discrete ( cavity ) mode via the atom - discrete mode interaction ; second , this photon is annihilated and a photon is created in a continuum ( external ) mode via the discrete - continuum mode coupling .",
    "the memory effect stems from the finite life span of the photo in the cavity @xcite .",
    "thus , the reabsorbing phenomenon that causes the oscillatory entanglement , as shown in figure [ pic1 ] and [ pic2 ] , only exists in the first step . in figure",
    "[ pic4 ] , the alternative peaks and valleys of @xmath138 and @xmath133 demonstrate that the energy of exciton exchanges between the two states @xmath139 and @xmath140 periodically .    assuming @xmath141 , we get @xmath142 ( the valley ) or @xmath143 ( the peak ) .",
    "the valley of @xmath133 coincides with the peak of @xmath144 at @xmath145 when @xmath146 , which makes @xmath134 act like a staircase curve .",
    "this means that if the exciton only exists in the atom , the damping process does not happen .",
    "the damping effect happens only when the photon escapes into the continuum modes and never comes back . in our case , there is no mechanism , such as the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , to protect the exciton from escape .",
    "so the damping effect is unavoidable and the memory effect is just a finite - time phenomenon , which indicates that atom entanglement can never be completely reconstructed and the information will be totally transferred to the reservoirs , which fits the results in figure [ pic1 ] and [ pic3 ] .",
    "we study the dynamical evolution of a couple of two - level atoms interacting with independent structured reservoirs . we find that reservoir entanglement exhibits sudden birth , death and revival phenomena",
    ". the revival of atom entanglement does not necessarily indicate the disentanglement of reservoirs , and vice versa . applying the quantitative analysis",
    ", we derive the criteria for the revival ( death ) phenomena and prove that the atom entanglement can revive before , simultaneously or after the sudden death of reservoir entanglement , which is independent of the relative strength of atom - reservoir interaction . besides , by studying the bipartite and multipartite entanglement for different partitions , we present a comprehensive interpretation of the information transmission within this composite system in non - markovian regime .",
