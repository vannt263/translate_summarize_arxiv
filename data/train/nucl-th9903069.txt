    "there is a longstanding discrepancy between the theoretical ratio of the total neutron induced nonmesonic decay rate @xmath1 to @xmath2 , the total decay rate for the proton - induced nonmesonic decay rate of various hypernuclei to experimental data@xcite .",
    "the experimental values are typically around 1 except for the very light hypernucleus @xmath5he @xcite , while theoretical evaluations lead to 0.05 - 0.2 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath6 is estimated either from neutron measurements and/or deduced from the measured values of the total nonmesonic decay rate @xmath7 and of @xmath4 as @xmath8 apparently this relation can not be strictly true due to interferences . the quantity @xmath4 is determined experimentally from measuring single proton spectra and assuming that those protons are generated by the p - induced decay . again",
    "this can not be strictly true since the n - induced decay leaves behind spectator proton(s ) and final state interactions can carry momentum from neutrons to protons .",
    "we shall shed light in this article on those critical issues . on the theoretical side one faces the nuclear many body problem .",
    "rigorous solutions based on realistic modern baryon - baryon forces are not in sight .",
    "therefore shell model pictures supplemented by jastrow type two - body correlations are typically being used and final state interactions are established by optical potentials .",
    "it appears difficult to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions . in such a situation",
    "a view on very light systems is of increasing interest . in the 3-baryon system",
    "bound and scattering states can be rigorously gained based on modern realistic baryon - baryon forces @xcite .",
    "therefore uncertainties about the quality of the hypernucleus wavefunction and final state interactions are absent . in the four - body system",
    "first rigorous solutions for bound states ( @xmath5h and @xmath5he ) already appeared @xcite .",
    "the mesonic and nonmesonic decays of @xmath0hhave been calculated @xcite but there are only few data to compare with . some mesonic decay rates for @xmath0h for which data are available agree rather well with that theory . though there are state of the art calculations no data are available for the very small nonmesonic decay rates of @xmath0h .",
    "we would like to use in this article that theoretical insight to throw light on the questionable issues mentioned above .",
    "in @xcite we found that the nonmesonic decays of @xmath0h leading to a final deuteron and a neutron are suppressed by about a factor 10 with respect to the full breakup processes .",
    "therefore we shall neglect those two - body fragmentation decay channels of @xmath0hin the following - except for pointing out that there a separation of n- and p- induced decays is clearly impossible .",
    "this is already evident from the fact that @xmath9= 0.39@xmath1010@xmath11s@xmath12 , whereas the total n+d decay rate @xmath13= 0.66@xmath1010@xmath11s@xmath12 .",
    "clearly there is a strong interference between the n- and p - induced decays .",
    "the exclusive differential n+n+p decay rate has the form @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the directions of two detected nucleons ( see @xcite for further information ) .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that there are regions in phase - space which are populated by n- and p- induced decays and therefore an experimental separation for those contributions is impossible .",
    "but there are also regions in phase - space which are rather cleanly populated by either n- or p- induced processes , but not both . therefore one has to be satisfied with certain fractions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , defined by integrations over certain subregions of the total phase - space . in this manner one can measure n- and",
    "p- induced process separately .",
    "the fact that certain parts of the phase - space are populated by both processes coherently makes it obvious that by no means one will be able to access experimentally @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately .",
    "nevertheless we would like to demonstrate this explicitely in the approach to @xmath4 which is being used for heavier hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "there one investigates the semiexclusive decay process in which only one proton is detected .",
    "therefore we shall study in this article the single differential decay rate @xmath17/@xmath18 and in addition also @xmath17/@xmath19 and investigate whether they can be separated into n- and p- induced contributions and whether certain energy ranges are dominated by one or the other process .",
    "our results are based on rigorous solutions of the faddeev equations for @xmath0hand the 3n final scattering states .",
    "we use the yn nijmegen potential @xcite which includes @xmath20-@xmath21 conversion .",
    "it turned out that this potential produces the experimental @xmath0hbinding energy without further adjustment@xcite .",
    "for the nn forces we used the nijmegen 93 potential @xcite . we expect no dependence on the choice among the most modern nn potentials .",
    "for the hypertriton this has been verified .",
    "the importance of the final state interaction is demonstrated by also presenting results where the 3n scattering state in the nuclear matrixelement occurring in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced by 3n plane wave states .",
    "this extreme approximation will , like in @xcite , be denoted by symmetrized plane wave impulse approximation ( pwias ) , whereas the calculation with final state interaction will be called `` full '' . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath17/@xmath22 , @xmath23/@xmath22 and @xmath24/@xmath22 in pwias . the quantity @xmath25 / @xmath22 has two peaks , one at very low neutron energies and one close to the maximal possible neutron energy .",
    "the peak at the higher energy is fed by the n- and p- induced processes as is obvious from the corresponding peaks in @xmath26/@xmath22 and @xmath27/@xmath22 . clearly in both processes a high energetic neutron is produced .",
    "surprisingly for us @xmath28/@xmath22 + @xmath29/@xmath22 sum up to @xmath30/@xmath22 with an error smaller than 5 % .",
    "the interference terms are therefore numerically very small .",
    "for very small neutron energies @xmath31/@xmath22 dies out , since the n- induced process creates mostly high energetic neutrons .",
    "the p- induced process , however , @xmath24/@xmath22 , exhibits a strong peak at very low neutron energies , which is caused by the ( spectator ) momentum distribution of the neutron in @xmath0h . clearly",
    "a measurement of the decay rate @xmath32/@xmath22 as a function of the neutron energy will not allow to separate the n- and",
    "p- induced processes - except at very low neutron energies , where the energy distribution of the neutrons , however , is not determined by the @xmath20-decay process . that picture does not change qualitatively",
    "if one turns on the final state interaction as can be seen in fig 2 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the rates are quite different .",
    "we can see a reduction factor of about 2 and the neglection of fsi would be disastrous in a quantitative analysis of data .",
    "now the sum @xmath33/@xmath22 + @xmath27/@xmath34 equals @xmath35/@xmath22 only within about 12 % .",
    "the situation for a separation of n- and p- induced processes appears somewhat more favourable if one regards the single particle decay rates as a function of the proton energy .",
    "our results are shown in fig . 3 for pwias and fig . 4 for the `` full '' calculation .",
    "for large proton energies nearly all protons result from the p- induced process : @xmath32/@xmath36/ @xmath37 in case of pwias .",
    "the quantity @xmath23/@xmath37 can not produce high energetic protons except due to fsi and this is indeed visible by comparing figs .",
    "@xmath38/@xmath37 exhibits , however , the very low energetic proton peak from the spectator proton in @xmath0h .",
    "also note again the reduction factor of about 2 caused by fsi .",
    "let us now quantify the question , whether integrated proton distributions can provide a good estimate for @xmath4 .",
    "clearly the very low energetic peak should be excluded and one has to start integrating @xmath32/@xmath37 from the highest possible proton energy @xmath39 , downwards .",
    "thus we compare the integrals @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 as functions of @xmath43 .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .",
    "5 and 6 for pwias and full .",
    "we see that in the case of pwias down to about @xmath44 50mev the two curves @xmath45 and @xmath46 are close to each other within less than 5% and only then start to deviate strongly .",
    "while @xmath47 flattens out and approaches @xmath4=@xmath48 , @xmath49 receives contributions from the n - induced process .",
    "the situation is not so favourable , however , for the case full . around @xmath43=60",
    "mev the relative deviation @xmath50/@xmath51 is about 10 % and increase to about 20 % around @xmath43=15mev .",
    "below that the deviation increases up to 30 % .",
    "note also the relative factor of about 2 between pwias and full .",
    "we have to conclude that an estimate for @xmath4 from @xmath52/@xmath18 is only possible within an error of about 30 % .",
    "if one is satisfied with a fraction of @xmath4 the error can be reduced to about 10 % .",
    "a well defined manner to receive information on the p- and n - induced decays separately is to use the differential decay rate of eq.([eq1 ] ) as described in @xcite .",
    "there are certain regions in phase space which are populated only by the p- induced decay and others which are populated only by the n - induced decay . in this manner",
    "one does not get the total @xmath53 or @xmath54 , but at least well defined fractions thereof .",
    "now we would like to address the question , whether @xmath3 can be found via eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) in case of @xmath0h .",
    "this is a pure theoretical issue since , as we just demonstrated , @xmath4 can not be measured for @xmath0h .",
    "surprisingly enough eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) is valid .",
    "as seen from table v in @xcite we have @xmath55 that sum has to be compared with @xmath56= 0.57 @xmath5710@xmath58 , which treats the full process correctly as a coherent sum of the n- and p - induced decays .",
    "these numerical results validate eq.([eq0 ] ) in the case of @xmath0h .",
    "since @xmath53 in the case of @xmath0hcan not be measured , it appears advisable to concentrate directly on @xmath25/@xmath37 and @xmath25/@xmath22 and compare those distributions to theory .",
    "this is an alternative to the above mentioned exclusive processes .",
    "while measurements of the nonmesonic decay of @xmath0happear to be far away , data for the four - body hypernuclei already exist @xcite and theoretical predictions can be expected to come up in the near future .",
    "this will then allow interesting tests of the nonmesonic decay matrixelements , which will be based on realistic four - body wavefunctions and various meson - exchange operators @xcite , which drive the nonmesonic decay process .",
