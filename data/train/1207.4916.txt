    "the goal is not to just select only the bona - fide , previously identified  disks but also to exclude as many disks , that were previously classified as non-  as practical .",
    "this latter criterion immediately excludes gini - asymmetry and gini-  combinations .",
    "the combination of 20  and asymmetry in  is promising and we define the following criterion to identify  disks in an  survey ( 6 `` resolution ) : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : things : m20a }    sample and we divide the linear relation by a factor two for the  survey ( to account for the @xmath3412 '' resolution ) : @xmath42 with dashed lines .",

    "the 20-asymmetry criterion selects most  but with a contamination of some 55% of non-  disks . a future search for  disks could therefore use this as a first cut before visual classification .",

    "we mark those galaxies identified by @xcite and those identified as extended uv or  disks by the concentration parameters .",
    "based on the   morphologies , the @xmath0 and @xmath43 criteria , those  disks that host an  disk are not interacting in the majority of cases . in the case of the other morphological criteria ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) ,",
    "this distinction is not as clear - cut but  disks either selected by thilker et al or by their concentration appear to reside in morphologically very typical  disks .    at the same time , extended   disks are often interacting .",
    "this is in part because of our definition of an interaction is based on concentration but even in the @xmath0 criterion , these are conspicuously separated from the bulk of the  disks .",
    "typically , the bona - fide  disks selected by an  morphological selection of an ongoing merger appear to be type 1 , consistent with the first impression from figures [ f : xuvt0 ] - [ f : xuvt2 ] .",
    "thus , mergers appear to be one avenue to generate a type 1  disk .    if we plot these as a sanity check for the  sample , the  disks identified by @xcite equally appear not to be interacting based on the criterion , but several are based on g - a or 20-g criteria .",
    "several of the non-  disks are interactions in a-20 .",
    "these criteria would need to be adjusted for the higher resolution of the  sample ( difficult to do without many mergers in the  sample , as we noted in * ? ? ?",
    "our first motivation for this study was to explore the possibility if  disks could be reliably found using the morphological parameters in  and , especially when computed over a wide aperture such as the  disk .",
    "based on their morphology parameters in  and ,  disks identified in @xcite rarely stand out from the bulk of the  sample , with the exception of 20-a and concentration in . in the",
    ", the 20-a relation appears reasonably successful in identifying  disks and the rate in the  sample ( 23% ) is consistent with the @xcite and @xcite result , for a survey of late - types such as .",
    "the  values of asymmetry and 20  could therefore be used to identify candidate  disks in the local universe with  or similar quality  data or in deep rest - frame  observations with _",
    "however , these will have to be computed over a much larger area than commonly used ( e.g. , the de vaucouleur diameter @xmath47 or the petrosian radius ) , such as the one defined by the outer  contour .",
    "the quantified  and  morphologies do not correlate as closely as they did for the  sample in @xcite ( their figure 6 ) . in our opinion , this is due to the wider range of environments probed by the  survey as well as its lower resolution compared to .",
    "a closer relation may return for the inner stellar disk and possibly at higher spatial resolution .",
    "our second motivation for this work on  disks was to explore their origin .",
    "are they the ( by)product of ( a ) cold flow accretion , ( b ) a gravitational interaction or mergers with another galaxy or ( c ) is photo - dissociation of molecular clouds by the  regions of the  disks responsible for the  disks ?",
    "the fact that the majority of the  disks do not reside in morphologically distinct  disks ( figure [ f : morphfuv ] and [ f : thingsfuv ] ) , precludes the notion that most  disks originate from major interaction between galaxies .",
    "few are selected by the previously defined interaction criteria for  disks .",
    "there are , however , some obvious exceptions ( figure [ f : xuvt1 ] ) .",
    "so our nave interpretation for the origin of type 1 disks in figure [ f : xuvt1 ] is only partly supported by  morphology and only holds for type 1 . since extended  ( ) and extended  disk ( ) populations as defined by their concentration parameter computed over the",
    "area do not coincide ( figure [ f : morphfuv ] , top left panel ) , a direct link , such as the photo - dissociation origin of the  disk , appears less likely .",
    "a closer   relation in morphology may well still hold within the inner stellar disk , especially since the photo - dissociation scenario was developed to explain the higher column densities of  in this environment @xcite",
    ". however , the existence of both the @xmath3 disks without complementary extended  disks as well as extended ( @xmath48 )  disks without a complementary  disk appears to be contradictory to the photo - dissociation origin of  disks .",
    "two considerations are still in its favor however , @xcite showed that uv emission does not fully trace the lower - lever star - formation in the low - column density environments of the outer disk .",
    "thus , the ionizing stars may be lower - mass main sequence stars and simply remain undetected in  imaging due to their extreme low surface - brightness . and with higher resolution and more sensitive  and  imaging , a closer relation may still return in their quantified morphology ( witness the  sample ) .",
    "thus , we can not completely rule out a photo - dissociation scenario explaining the relation between  and  disks .",
    "similarly , @xcite find their time - scale argument for a photo - dissociation origin of  disks to be inconclusive .",
    "this leaves cold flows as a likely origin for most  disks .",
    "a number of these type 1  disks may be the result of a later - stage full merger such as ugc 04862 but judging from the  morphologies , this is small fraction of the full  or  sample .",
    "cold flows occur as both a steady trickle along a filament of the cosmic web as well as discrete accretion in the form of the cold gas originally associated with a small satellite .",
    "there are indirect signs that cold flows are indeed the most common cause for  disks .",
    "for example , at least three of the nine  galaxies with an  disk ( m83 , ngc 4736 and ngc 5055 ) are currently cannibalizing a small companion @xcite .",
    "satellites embedded in the gas filament are one of two fueling mechanisms of cold flow ; discrete and trickle cold flows @xcite .",
    "the acquired cold gas accompanying the cannibalized companion is a likely trigger for the formation  complexes .",
    "similarly , those disks selected by their extended  emission ( figure [ f : xuv ] ) , often appear to have flocculent , low - column density  morphologies , which _ may _ point to recent cold accretion .",
    "a few cases ( ugc 7081 , 7651 , and 7853 ) are obviously interacting major mergers with accompanying /  tidal features .",
    "in contrast , the  disks are nearly always small galaxies with an obvious close companion ( figure [ f : xhi ] ) , which makes a tidal origin likely for their very extended  disk .",
    "the quantified morphologies of the  and  disks are not conclusive evidence that cold flows are responsible for the  complexes but certainly suggest this is the most likely origin for most , with a few exception due to major interactions .",
    "based on the quantified morphology of the  and  maps of the  sample of galaxies , we conclude the following :    * there are distinct galaxy populations that stand out by their high concentration values in  or  (  and  thoughout the paper ) .",
    "these population do not overlap .",
    "some known  disks are in the  sample ( figures [ f : morphfuv]-a [ f : morphfuv]-e , [ f : thingsfuv]-a and [ f : thingsfuv]-c).to compute this concentration index , the outer  contour is needed to delineate the extent of the disk . * the fact that relative dilute  disks ( @xmath3 ) and  disks ( @xmath2 ) population do not overlap at all and the lack of close morphological relations in any other parameters together suggest that a common small - scale origin for the  and  disks , such as a photodissociation of molecular hydrogen scenario , is less likely for  disks ( but may still very much hold for the inner disks ) .",
    "* asymmetry and 20  can be used in combination to select  disks with reasonable reliability ( 80% included ) but substantial contamination ( 55% ) , when properly calibrated for the survey s spatial resolution ( equation [ eq : things : m20a ] and [ eq : whisp : m20a ] ) and the morphologies computed over a large enough aperture . with this selection , one can find the number of  disks in a survey or candidates for visual classification ( figure [ f : fuvmorph ] ) .",
    "* based on the morphology of the  disk in which they occur ,  disks appear not to occur often in tidally disturbed gas disks ( figures [ f : himorph ] and [ f : hithings ] ) . * in a few cases , the  disk _ is _ the product of a major merger ; for example ugc 04862 , identified by @xcite and ugc 7081 , 7651 , and 7853 , identified by their large  concentration .",

    "<S> extended ultraviolet ( ) disks have been found in a substantial fraction of late - type s0 , spiral and irregular galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , most late - type spirals have an extended gas disk , observable in the 21 cm radio line ( ) . the morphology of galaxies can be quantified well using a series of scale - invariant parameters ; concentration - asymmetry - smoothness ( cas ) , gini , 20 , and @xmath0 parameters . in this series of papers </S>",
    "<S> , we apply these to  column density maps to identify mergers and interactions , lopsidedness and now  disks .    in this paper , we compare the quantified morphology and effective radius ( @xmath1 ) of the westerbork observations of neutral hydrogen in irregular and spiral galaxies project ( )  maps to those of far - and near - ultraviolet images obtained with , to explore how close the morphology and scales of  and  in these disks correlate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that  disks do not stand out by their effective radii in  or . </S>",
    "<S> however , the concentration index in  appears to select some  disks . and </S>",
    "<S> known  disks can be identified via a criterion using asymmetry and 20 ; 80% of  disks are included but with 55% contamination . </S>",
    "<S> this translates into 61 candidate  disk out of our 266 galaxies , 23% consistent with previous findings . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the  and  morphology parameters do not appear closely related .    </S>",
    "<S> our motivation is to identify  disks and their origin . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three scenarios ; tidal features from major mergers , the typical extended  disk is a photo - dissociation product of the  regions and both  and  features originate in cold flows fueling the main galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> we define extended  and  disks based on their concentration ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) , but that these two subsamples never overlap in the  sample . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to discount a simple photo - dissociation origin of the outer  disk .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , we identified the morphology space occupied by ongoing major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> known  disks rarely reside in the merger dominated part of  morphology space but those that do are type 1 . </S>",
    "<S> exceptions ,  disks in ongoing mergers , are the previously identified ugc 4862 and ugc 7081 , 7651 , and 7853 . </S>",
