    "with the significant sensitivity improvement of forthcoming next generation gravitational wave detectors like advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite and the lcgt @xcite there is a realistic chance that gravitational waves may be directly observed .",
    "in addition to transient events such as neutron star and/or black hole mergers or supernovae , which require that an event happens sufficiently near to us during the observation period @xcite , it is important to also consider continuous sources .",
    "millisecond pulsars are a particularly promising class since they are very old and stable systems and therefore could be reliable sources of gravitational waves .",
    "their fast rotation strongly favors gravitational wave emission @xcite , and the fact that their timing behavior is known to high precision @xcite greatly simplifies the analysis required to find a signal in the detector data .",
    "emission due to deformation of these objects ( `` mountains '' ) , which is usually parametrized by an ellipticity , is the standard paradigm for continuous gravitational wave searches @xcite , but global oscillation modes of a star can also emit copious gravitational waves that could be detectable if the oscillation reaches sufficiently high amplitudes .",
    "r - modes are the most interesting class @xcite , because they are generically unstable in millisecond pulsars and therefore will be present unless the dissipative damping is strong enough .",
    "if r - modes arise in a spinning neutron star , they affect the spindown ( since they cause the star to lose angular momentum via gravitational radiation ) and the cooling ( since the the damping forces on the r - mode generate heat ) . to understand the interplay of these effects we have developed @xcite an effective description of the spindown evolution where complicated details about the star s interior are absorbed into a few effective parameters .",
    "the resulting spindown can be rather different from that predicted by simpler approaches , and includes strict bounds on the uncertainties in the final results . in this paper",
    "we will use this method to analyze the possible r - mode gravitational radiation of old neutron stars .",
    "firstly , however , we provide some background and motivation .",
    "r - modes can occur in young or old pulsars . in the case of young sources",
    "@xcite we have analyzed their r - mode evolution @xcite and found that r - modes can provide a _ quantitative _ explanation for their observed low spin rates .",
    "moreover , the r - mode gravitational emission is expected to be strong , because a large r - mode amplitude would be required to spin down the known young pulsars to their current low spin frequencies within their lifetimes which are as short as a thousand years .",
    "these known pulsars are no longer in their r - mode spindown epoch , but there may be unobserved young neutron stars , e.g. associated with known supernova remnants such as sn 1987a , that are currently undergoing r - mode spindown , and several of them would be in the sensitivity range of advanced ligo @xcite , allowing this scenario to be falsified by future measurements .",
    "in this paper we focus on old neutron stars which have been spun up by accretion , and we perform an analysis of their expected r - mode gravitational wave radiation . in @xcite novel r - mode instability regions in spindown timing parameter space have been derived that allow us to decide if r - modes can be present in old millisecond radio pulsars . as discussed there ,",
    "there are two scenarios to explain the observed timing data .",
    "it might be that the ordinary nuclear matter model of neutron stars is incomplete , and there is additional damping ( e.g.  from exotic forms of matter or currently overlooked physical processes ) that stops r - modes from growing in these stars . in this case",
    "there will be no r - mode gravitational radiation from old neutron stars .",
    "the other possibility is the conventional scenario where only standard damping mechanisms are present in neutron stars . in this scenario",
    "most old millisecond pulsars _ will be _ undergoing r - mode oscillations , since for expected r - mode saturation amplitudes the dissipative heating ensures that fast spinning sources can neither cool nor spin out of the parameter region were r - modes are unstable @xcite . yet ,",
    "some slower spinning sources can escape the instability region and we will determine the limiting frequency .",
    "therefore , there will be gravitational radiation from most old neutron stars in this scenario , and the purpose of this paper is to find out whether it could be detected on earth .",
    "the detectability of known continuous sources is generally described by the `` spindown limit '' which is , for a specific source with known timing data , the maximum gravitational wave strain that can be emitted by that source . despite the quite restrictive limits set by the spindown data",
    ", the large spin frequencies of millisecond pulsars could nevertheless lead to a detectable signal .",
    "present gravitational wave detectors  like the original ligo interferometer  did not probe the spindown limit for millisecond pulsars .",
    "however , next generation detectors including the advanced ligo detector will be able to beat the spindown limit for various sources . therefore , it is interesting to assess the chance to detect gravitational emission from oscillating millisecond pulsars .",
    "we will introduce here the _",
    "universal r - mode spindown limit _ on the gravitational wave strain , which is more restrictive since it takes into account our understanding of the r - mode spindown and the complete information we have about these systems . whereas deformations of a given source depend on its evolutionary history and could therefore vary significantly from one source to another , for proposed saturation mechanisms the r - mode saturation amplitude proves to be rather insensitive to details of a particular source , like its mass or radius @xcite .",
    "the expected gravitational wave strain of a given source can then be strongly constrained by the timing data of the _ entire set _ of millisecond pulsars . using our semi - analytic approach to pulsar evolution , and assuming that the same saturation and cooling mechanism ( with given power - law dependence on temperature ) operates in all the stars , we",
    "can then obtain the universal limit given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : universal - spindown - limit ] ) .",
    "we will see that this is considerably below the standard spindown limits , indicating that it will be harder than previously expected to see r - mode gravitational waves from these sources .",
    "as described in @xcite the r - mode evolution @xcite can be discussed within an effective description , which relies on the fact that a compact star appears effectively as a point source and that the relevant material properties integrated over the star have simple power law dependencies on the macroscopic observables that change during the evolution .",
    "the relevant macroscopic quantities are the power emitted as gravitational waves @xmath0 , the dissipated power @xmath1 that heats the star and the thermal luminosity @xmath2 that cools the star @xmath3 in terms of the rotational angular velocity @xmath4 , the core temperature @xmath5 of the star and the dimensionless r - mode amplitude @xmath6 defined in @xcite .",

    "r - modes are unstable and their fast growth has to be stopped by a non - linear dissipative saturation mechanism .",
    "even though there are several interesting proposals @xcite it is not yet settled which mechanism will dominate and saturate r - modes . for millisecond pulsars we expect moderate saturation amplitudes , in which case the pulsar spindown",
    "is determined by the equation @xcite    @xmath19    in terms of the moment of inertia of the star @xmath20 and the r - mode saturation amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "the observed total spindown rate will in general be larger since in addition to r - modes there are other spindown mechanisms given by the ellipsis . nevertheless , by assuming that the observed spindown rate is entirely due to r - modes , observed pulsar timing data allows one to give upper bounds on the r - mode saturation amplitude .",

    "the exponents are fixed ( rational ) numbers determined by the saturation mechanism , whereas the reduced amplitude @xmath27 is less well known and can also depend on parameters of the particular source , like the mass or the radius . using this general approach",
    "it was found in @xcite that the r - mode heating is significant even for small amplitude modes and the thermal evolution is systematically faster than the spindown .",
    "therefore the star reaches a thermal steady state where the dissipative r - mode heating balances the cooling due to photons and neutrinos and the temperature is given by    @xmath28    this leads to a spindown equation along this steady state curve @xcite    @xmath29    with an effective braking index    @xmath30    that depends on the saturation mechanism and can be rather different from the generic r - mode spindown exponent @xmath31 .",

    "our results do not rely on explicit estimates for the r - mode saturation amplitude , which depend on the microphysics and are still very uncertain , but merely on the parametric temperature and frequency dependence which is generic for a given saturation mechanism and given by characteristic rational power - law exponents .",
    "we compare our improved bounds to the detection thresholds for realistic searches with next generation detectors like advanced ligo using a year of coherent data and find that for none of the known millisecond radio pulsars would r - mode gravitational waves be detectable in the near future .",
    "this is in contrast to r - mode emission from young sources , where several potential sources are in reach of advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "however , if the sensitivity could be improved by the combination of different detectors , the analysis of larger coherent data sets or other enhancements , the universal spindown limits of selected millisecond pulsars which are close to the the detection limit might be beaten by next generation searches . for third generation detectors , like the planned einstein telescope , there is a realistic chance to detect dozens of sources and our refined bounds identify those that are most promising .",
    "in contrast to the conventional spindown limit ( triangles in fig .  [",
    "fig : universal - spindown - limits ] ) , which is sizable for some lower frequency sources , the universal spindown limit ( circles or rectangles in fig .  [ fig : universal - spindown - limits ] ) shows that it is actually the mid- to high - frequency sources which feature the largest bounds .",
    "the universal spindown limit relies on the assumption that the same r - mode saturation mechanism is operating in the entire set of radio pulsars . in principle",
    "it can not be completely excluded that different saturation mechanisms are at work in different sources .",
    "this could happen if there were classes of sources with qualitatively different structural or phase compositions .",
    "for the recycled old radio pulsars that we focus on in this paper , this is not a likely scenario .",
    "these stars are very stable systems that hardly change over time and have very similar properties .",
    "for instance the magnetic fields that could distinguish different radio pulsars are all rather small and are not expected to strongly affect the r - mode evolution besides the additional magnetic spindown .",
    "however , it is quite possible that old and young stars have different saturation mechanisms , in fact such a difference is required to explain the low spin frequencies of young pulsars @xcite and the low spindown limits of old radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "one possibility is enhanced dissipation due to the transformation of a neutron star or its core into a quark star owing to the density increase during the initial spindown @xcite .",
    "another option would be enhanced dissipation in a superfluid / superconductor @xcite which is only present below the superfluid melting temperature and this transition might have been explicitly observed in the cooling of the neutron star in cassiopeia a @xcite .",
    "both of these transitions would happen in the dynamic early evolution of young sources , before they are a few hundreds of years old .",
    "in contrast , recycled old radio pulsars are very stable systems that hardly change over time and have very similar properties .",
    "for instance the magnetic fields that could distinguish different radio pulsars are all rather small and are not expected to strongly affect the r - mode evolution besides the additional magnetic spindown .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the same saturation mechanism is realized in the entire class of old millisecond radio pulsars is reasonable .",
    "in addition to the exciting prospect of directly detectable gravitational waves , the emission from oscillating pulsars presents a unique chance to directly probe the interior of a compact star .",
    "the amplitude of r - modes , which is encoded in the gravitational wave signal , can directly reveal the damping properties of the matter inside the star and thereby its composition .",
    "in addition to thermal measurements from low mass x - ray binaries @xcite and pulsar timing data @xcite , gravitational waves would provide a third messenger to probe the interior star composition via r - modes .",
    "the combined analysis of these different data sets would provide a clearer picture of the star s interior and could allow us to discriminate different star compositions in the future ."
