    "<S> we present an analysis of self - imaging in a regime beyond the paraxial , where deviation from simple paraxial propagation causes apparent self - imaging aberrations . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting structures are examples of aberration without rays and are described analytically using post - paraxial theory . </S>",
    "<S> they are shown to relate to , but surprisingly do not precisely replicate , a standard integral representation of a diffraction cusp . beyond the talbot effect , this result is significant as it illustrates that the effect of aberration  as manifested in the replacement of a perfect focus with a cusp - like pattern  can occur as a consequence of improving the paraxial approximation , rather than due to imperfections in the optical system .    the talbot effect @xcite is a well - known self - imaging phenomenon in classical optics , where a transversely periodic field reproduces itself at periodic distances in the propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> as a natural consequence of paraxial wave propagation , it has also been observed in the diffraction of matter waves @xcite and has an analogue in the revivals of quantum wavepackets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the talbot effect for surface plasmons @xcite has attracted significant attention because of applications in areas such as nanolithography @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the perfect image revival of the classical talbot effect can be understood in terms of fresnel diffraction @xcite and interpreted as an artefact of the corresponding paraxial approximation . </S>",
    "<S> refining the propagation beyond the paraxial approach leads to aberration - like distortion of perfect self - imaging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonparaxial self - imaging has been studied previously for binary gratings using both scalar theory @xcite and full electromagnetic treatment @xcite , and has particular importance in plasmonics where the transverse periodicity is comparable to the plasmon wavelength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such nonparaxial self - images are not perfect revivals as they are in the paraxial case , and are only approximately periodic in the direction of propagation .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a nonparaxial talbot effect and explain that the resulting apparent aberration  the maximum intensity shifts and distorts to a cusp - like pattern  is not caused by imperfection in a lens or optical system ( since the talbot effect is lensless imaging ) , but rather as an actual improvement of the approximation , appropriate to our diffraction regime . specifically , we invoke the fourth - order post - paraxial approximation @xcite to investigate the talbot - based focusing of scalar waves in a regime which is nonparaxial , but not extremely so : the transverse periodicity is of the order of some tens of wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the appearance of diffraction cusps in the intensity patterns of surface plasmons calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these aberration - like effects are not unique to plasmons and are connected to a standard integral representation of the diffraction pattern about a cusped caustic @xcite despite the absence here of any actual ray caustic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we obtain a simple expression for the approximate location of the post - paraxial foci , which are shifted to be short of the paraxial talbot distance .    </S>",
    "<S> to demonstrate the physics of the post - paraxial regime , we employ a general two - dimensional ( 2d ) formalism ( transverse in @xmath0 and propagating in @xmath1 ) which displays properties of both paraxial and nonparaxial regimes in different limits . specifically , it consists of a transverse array ( with period @xmath2 in the @xmath0-direction ) of monochromatic 2d point sources of wavelength @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> while the analytic form of these post - paraxial foci is related to the standard description of diffraction about a cusp , there is a subtle distinction since it is the _ incomplete _ pearcey function that occurs and not the standard pearcey function . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : pe ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is clear when comparing intensity patterns - while both are cusp - like distributions , there is additional complex detail accounted for in the post - paraxial talbot effect that is absent from the normal pearcey function . </S>",
    "<S> another important difference is that there is no ray caustic underpinning the structure of the post - paraxial cusp foci as there is with the complete pearcey function . despite their differences </S>",
    "<S> , the location of the maximum of intensity of the post - paraxial foci can be fairly well approximated using a scaled pearcey function .    </S>",
    "<S> it is curious to see that the effect of post - paraxiality on a focus appears to be that of aberration , when compared to the paraxial case . </S>",
    "<S> however , while the analytic form mimics that for aberration ( hence the inclusion of the pearcey function , albeit incomplete ) , it actually embodies an improvement of the paraxial approximation for the post - paraxial regime . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is a universal effect that occurs as the parameters of a system ( regardless of its exact realisation ) move away from paraxiality </S>",
    "<S> .    the results in this paper may plausibly find application in plasmonics , since it is a field in which the pertinent wavelengths and periodicities are comparable , and so nonparaxial effects are important . while the lengthscales considered here are slightly greater than those experimentally investigated so far , it would be both interesting and challenging to confirm the aberration - like effects of post - paraxiality on the talbot effect .    </S>",
