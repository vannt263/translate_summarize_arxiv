    "the difference between modelling these events and modelling the related ex lup stars ( shorter duty cycle and lower amplitude ) and v1647 ori type objects ( shorter duty cycle but similar amplitude , with evidence of the contributions of both accretion enhancement and extinction reduction in their brightening ) is that the fu  ori  stars can be identified for decades after their bursts , whereas the other types of objects must be identified during the weeks to months to year that they are bursting .",

    "v1057  cyg  was discovered as emission line object lkh@xmath3 190 by herbig ( 1958 ) and was presumed a normal t tauri star  until it underwent a 5.5 mag outburst in 1969 thus becoming the second known fu  ori  star ; its decay is much more rapid , and it is now only 2 mag above quiescence .",

    "given an assumed typical outburst lifetime of @xmath21  years , this implies an outburst rate closer to @xmath12 is needed , or an even higher @xmath22 if the more typical quiescent and outburst accretion rate values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , are adopted . of note",

    "thus the actual duration of fu ori outbursts may be a factor of several longer than what is typically assumed . under the logic above",
    ", the outburst rate needed to reconcile the t  tauri accretion rate vs age problem using the episodic fu  ori outburst model is inversely proportional to the assumed outburst lifetime .",
    "longer duration bursts mean lower rates and , conversely , if we allow for some fraction of shorter duration fu  ori outbursts with lifetimes of only @xmath25  years , then the needed outburst rate is higher by factors of several than the numbers above .",

    "increasing interest in young star variability mechanisms has led to more and larger ( both wider field and longer duration ) as well as often multiwavelength time series data sets .",
    "the value of the earliest possible first epoch observation is considerable , as illustrated in figure [ fig : mdotmodel ] .",
    "access to a 100 year baseline would mean either a reduction in the number of stars needed in the survey , or an improvement on the limit able to be placed on the fu  ori  rate  both by the same factor of 100  relative to a 1 year baseline survey .    in practice , an automated comparison of two fields at widely separated epochs would select stars with measured magnitudes that differed by some threshold @xmath81 as candidate fu  ori  objects , to be confirmed or rejected by follow - up observations .",
    "the actual magnitude increase @xmath82 to which such a strategy is complete is always larger than @xmath81 because of measurement errors in the photometry at each epoch .",

    "( 2013 ) used the mid - infrared spitzer - wise 5-year baseline to compare photometry of several thousand stars . consequently ,",
    "as clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : mdotmodel ] , they could constrain the fu  ori  rate to only much higher values ( by several orders of magnitude ) than the historical estimates of the fu  ori  rate that were discussed in  3.1 , established based on alternate considerations .    from a survey with ptf consisting of over 1000 observations over the past 5.5 years towards the north america and pelican nebulae",
    ", two large - amplitude brightening events were discovered : ptf 10nvg ( v2492  cyg ) which is likely a combination of accretion burst behavior and variable obscuration ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "2013 ) perhaps analagous to v1647 ori , and ptf 10qpf ( v2493  cyg ) which is a bona fide fu  ori  star ( semkov et al . 2010 ; miller et al .",
    "2011 ) previously known as the class ii classical t tauri star lkh@xmath3",
    "188/g4or hbc 722 .",
    "both were discovered within the first season of ptf monitoring and  given the only few thousand star sample of known young stars in the region would suggest an fu  ori  rate significantly higher than the canonical value .    considering a parent sample of @xmath12000 stars in the region with evidence of circumstellar material , and assuming perfect detection efficiency , the implied event rate is then @xmath95 outbursts per star per year . from the simulations presented here , the 90% confidence interval for this rate is [ @xmath96 outbursts per star per year .",
    "of course , statistical estimates based on only a single detection are not adequate predictors . at the implied event rate ,",
    "the chances of not seeing another fu  ori  outburst for another 20 years are only 3% , while at the lower bound , there is a 30% chance of no additional outbursts in the next 20 years .",
    "in addition to the bona fide fu  ori   star outbursts , there are also lower - amplitude bursts that have been identified , including the ex lup group illustrated in figure 1 , as well as even shorter timescale and lower amplitude bursts that are more routinely found in modern survey data .",
    "these less extreme but more common types may also play an important role in the accretion history of a star .    among a sample of young stars selected based on variability and infrared - excess , findeisen et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found in the north america and pelican nebulae region that 12% @xmath97 3% exhibited bursting behavior on timescales from 0.1 to 100 days , with amplitudes from 0.2 to 1.5 mag .",
    "if confirmed as accretion - driven events , the cases of repeated bursts reported there may be the first empirical examples of accretion - driven cyclic behavior caused by processes in the inner disk , such as those predicted on time scales of a few tens of days in the disk instability mechanisms described in  2.2 .",
    "the simulations presented above are not applicable to these shorter duration burst events since we have not included either the survey cadence ( which needs to be short enough to catch and time - resolve the burst ) or the burst duration ( which needs to be long enough to be detected ) as model parameters in our simple framework .      as stated earlier , estimating an event rate requires measuring a number of detections , with considerations to bias , from among the number of objects for which detections could be made .",
    "the numerator in the rate equation is the number of fu  ori  outbursts observed .",
    "there are in fact two sides of the fu  ori  outburst phenomenon which may be amenable to detection : one the rise side or outburst itself , occuring over weeks or months , and the other the decay side , occuring over decades and centuries .",
    "numerous projects dedicated to other ( usually extraglactic ) science areas are also finding young star outbursts , some of which are even fu  ori  like .",
    "the currently operating asas , css , and ptf will be succeeded by next generation surveys such as atlas , ztf , and lsst , all of which are capable of making discoveries in this area .",
    "the atlas project , for example , is predicting 5 fu  ori  stars in its first year of operations .",
    "survey yield will depend on parameters such as sensitivity , cadence , and galactic latitude coverage , as well as on astrophysical factors such as the range in burst amplitudes and rise times , and the frequency of visibility at optical vs infrared - only vs submm - only wavelengths ( e.g. johnstone et al 2013 ) .",
    "none of these considerations are included in our simple simulations , in which they were wrapped up in the factor @xmath98 which was set to unity .",
    "however , the results may be generalized to the case of @xmath99 by considering that , even if not all fu  ori  sources are detected , a poisson / binomial process will still be observed albeit at an effectively reduced rate . a best estimate rate and a confidence interval could still be calculated , then multiplied by @xmath100 .",
    "in addition to catching the fu  ori  rise phase , various of these imminent time domain sky survey projects could also identify fu  ori  objects during the decay phase , by selecting for follow - up spectroscopy sources with consistent fading over their 5 - 10 years of operations .",
    "however , there is significant diversity in the post - outburst light curves of known fu  ori  stars ( see e.g. clarke et al .",
    "2005 , their figure 1 ) . for example , fu  ori  itself has decayed only slightly in 50 years , while v1057  cyg  had a much more rapid decay ; v1515  cyg  was slower to rise , but has had a relatively flat post - outburst light curve .",
    "the demoninator in the rate equation is the number of young stars with the possibility to undergo an fu  ori  outburst in a given survey .",
    "the true survey size is @xmath34 young stars with disks , which given a certain survey area is generally far less than as the number of objects photometrically detected in the field .",
    "young stars are identified via a variety of mechanisms associated with either stellar or circumstellar processes . taken in isolation",
    ", none may not be 100% reliable indicators of membership in @xmath81 - 3 myr old star forming regions , but in combination they can lead to secure knowledge of the total size and identity of the targetted young stellar population .",
    "the usually considered diagnostics of young t tauri stars are : photometric variability , low excitation emission lines , presence of quick - burning lithium , infrared excess due to circumtellar dust , ultraviolet excess due to re - radiated accretion shocks , and x - rays from both accretion and stellar coronal activity . as the fu  ori   phenomenon is driven by massive disks ,",
    "only so - called class - i and class - ii stars should be included in assessing survey statistics .",
    "this is a much easier scenario than other statistical problems such as the lifetime of disks where both the disked and non - disked populations must be thoroughly known , as well as the absolute source ages .",
    "there has been great progress over the last decade in terms of census building in star - forming regions .",
    "however , the job is not complete  even for regions within only a few hundred parsecs of the sun .",
    "spitzer - identified ( infrared excess ) and chandra - identified ( x - ray ) samples are incomplete , even in combination , in part because these were pointed missions .",
    "the recent availability of wide - field survey data from wise ( mid - infrared ) , 2mass and ukidss ( near - infrared ) , iphas / uvex ( optical ) , and galex ( ultraviolet ) can help fill in these census gaps near and in the galactic plane .",
    "non - outburst photometric variability is also  after some decades of hiatus  again being used to identify young stars .",
    "gaia results on kinematics will help define cluster and moving group membership for optically visible young stars .",
    "there are at present reasonable empirical constraints on the rate of occurence of phenomena such as m dwarf flares , novae , supernovae , and gamma ray bursts .",
    "each can be quantified in terms of the number per year per square degree per magnitude interval .",
    "the young star fu  ori   outbursts , however , which have luminosity increases between those of m dwarf flares and novae , are rare enough that only crude estimates exist for the number that occur within each young star disk lifetime",
    ". and while the rate is a significant number , more meaningful would be knowledge of the distribution of time separation between fu  ori  events during the first one to few myr when the star first becomes visible as a self - luminous hydrostatically contracting object .    in this paper",
    "we have provided a simple framework for considering how well we might be able to constrain the rate of fu  ori  outburst events .",
    "the method employs binomial statistics which are generally applicable to any phenomenon that can be treated as either occurring ( e.g. an outburst is detected ) or not occuring ( no outburst is detected ) . in our presentation",
    "we have provided numbers based on a 90% measurement confidence requirement ( a parameter of the statistical analysis that depends on the data actually obtained ) with a 90% probability ( a parameter which refers to having a representative sampling of the astrophysics ) , under the assumption that all outburst which occur are detected .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 illustrate the simulation results .    with the rigor specified above , empirically constraining the fu  ori  outburst rate to a level of @xmath101 requires @xmath102 young stars with disks to be monitored for @xmath103 year , or @xmath104 such stars for @xmath105 years .",
    "similarly , constraining the fu  ori  outburst rate to @xmath106 requires @xmath102 young stars with disks to be monitored for @xmath105 years , or @xmath104 such stars for @xmath107 years .",
    "finally outburst rates @xmath108 could be probed if @xmath109 young stars with disks were monitored for @xmath105 years , or @xmath102 such stars for @xmath107 years . in any case , more than several @xmath76 suitably disked young stars are needed in order to be on the linear parts of these scaling relations , given the likely range of true outburst rates .",
    "an extension of our calculation to shorter duration event types such as ex lup / v1647 ori or lower level bursts would require consideration of the survey cadence relative to the burst duration as additional model parameters .",
    "finally , we note that in order to estimate the true outburst rate , attention is needed not only to the numerator that reflects the number of actually detected outburst events , but to careful definition of the denominator , that is , the number of comparably aged young disked stars in the studied region .",
