    "with the startup of the lhc , high energy particle physics entered a new era . at higher energies , measurements with higher",
    "precision become available , which poses new demands to the theoretical predictions : the corresponding cross sections are needed beyond leading order ( lo ) accuracy even for large multiplicity final states . by",
    "now standard techniques exist @xcite for computing the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to many phenomenologically interesting processes involving four , or more hard objects ( heavy particle or hard jet ) in the final state @xcite . despite the improved accuracy obtained by computing the cross sections at nlo",
    ", there is still a large gap between fixed order theoretical predictions and data collected by the detectors . at fixed order",
    "we calculate only hard parton - level processes , while in experiments we observe hadrons . the common practice to fill",
    "this gap is the use of parton shower programs @xcite which also include hadronization models .",
    "the advantage of these programs is the generation of unweighted events , which can be utilized for performing the same analysis as on the collected data , allowing for a direct comparison of theory and experiment , or predicting the standard model background .",
    "however , these programs catch only the important features of small angle radiation off partons , and the distributions of observable quantities are not expected to give a good description in the regions dominated by large - angle hard emissions .    until recent years",
    ", these two main approaches were used separately for making predictions .",
    "merging nlo computations with parton showers was pioneered by the mcatnlo project @xcite .",
    "by now all interesting @xmath0 processes are included in the ` mc@nlo `  code @xcite .",
    "another method for merging nlo computations with parton showers , which produces only positive weight events , was developed in refs .",
    "the latter procedure was later implemented in the ` powheg box `  @xcite .",
    "the ` powheg box `  can almost be considered a black box that requires matrix elements as input and produces unweighted events in the form of les - houches accord files @xcite as output .",
    "these events can be processed with the ` powheg box `  for generating the showered events for further analysis .    in this letter",
    "we show the first application to a @xmath1 process of the combination of the ` powheg box `  and the ` helac`@xcite frameworks for producing showered events of the t@xmath2 + jet  final state that can be used to make distributions with correct perturbative expansion up to nlo accuracy . due to the large collision energy at the lhc",
    ", t@xmath3 pairs with large transverse momentum will be copiously produced and the probability for the top quarks to radiate gluons will be sufficiently large to make the t@xmath2 + jet  final state measurable with high statistics .",
    "therefore , we make first predictions for such events at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the cornerstone of our program is the ` powheg box `  @xcite framework , that uses the fks subtraction scheme @xcite for the nlo calculation .",
    "the ` powheg box `  requires the following input :    * we use flavour structures given in tables  [ tab : bflavours ] and  [ tab : rflavours ] . + .flavour structures of the born processes , @xmath4 u , d , c , s , b. [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     in order to check the predictions obtained with born - suppression , we computed the distributions published in ref.@xcite at nlo accuracy and we found agreement .",
    "examples are shown in fig.[fig : nlo ] for the case of the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the jet .",
    "the lower panels show the ratio of the powhel - nlo predictions to the predictions of ref.@xcite .",
    "the error bars in the lower panel represent the combined statistical uncertainty of the two computations .",
    "transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the jet . ]",
    "transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the jet . ]",
    "we also compared distributions obtained from lhe events , including the first radiation only , to predictions at nlo .",
    "for the distributions of the transverse momenta of the jet ( see also in fig.[fig : nlo ] ) and the top as well as for the rapidity distribution of the top we found agreement .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the jet is more central from the lhe events than from nlo .",
    "the production of t@xmath2 + jet  final state at the nlo accuracy together with decay of the heavy quarks in the narrow - width approximation ( at lo accuracy ) has been published recently by melnikov and schulze in @xcite . in our nlo+ps computation decays of heavy quarks",
    "are implemented in the ps , therefore , spin correlations are not included .",
    "in contrast , the narrow - width approximation allows for taking into account the spin correlations .",
    "thus , in order to see the effect of the parton shower , we first generated distributions without the shower , but with decays ( we just included on - shell decays of t - quarks , and further decays of their decay products , if unstable , turning off any shower and hadronization effect , marked as ` decay ' ) , then with the full shower monte carlo ( marked with the name of the smc ) .",
    "we compared the total cross section as well as several distributions to those predictions made for collisions at the tevatron , @xmath5 , valid at the nlo accuracy .",
    "we generated two million events with ` powhel ` , which were showered with ` pythia`-6.4.25 @xcite and ` herwig`-6.5.20 @xcite subsequently .",
    "for the comparison , we used the semileptonic decay channel and the following parameters and selection cuts from ref.@xcite : ( i ) mass of the top quark @xmath6 ; all other standard model parameters as implemented in the ps programs , ( ii ) cteq6 m parton distribution functions , ( iii ) @xmath7-clustering algorithm with @xmath8 and four - momentum recombination scheme @xcite , ( iv ) @xmath9 , ( v ) @xmath10 , ( vi ) @xmath11 , ( vii ) @xmath12 , ( viii ) @xmath13 , ( ix ) minimum five jets , and ( x ) @xmath14 , where @xmath15  is the scalar sum of transverse momenta in the event , @xmath16 in addition , if the final state after these selection cuts contained one or more charged leptons , we rejected the event if the transverse momentum of this lepton was above 20@xmath17 .",
    "this latter requirement is not needed in a fixed order calculation , but necessary in ours to select the semileptonic channel .",
    "the technical cut was chosen to @xmath18= 5@xmath17 .",
    "the predicted smc cross sections are very sensitive to the details of the analysis .",
    "we kept the leptons and neutral pions stable , while all other particles were allowed to be stable or to decay according to the default implementation in each smc .",
    "quark masses , as well as @xmath19 , @xmath20 masses and total decay widths , were tuned to the same values in ` pythia `  and ` herwig ` . on the other hand ,",
    "each of the two codes was allowed to compute autonomously partial branching fractions in different decay channels for all unstable particles and hadrons .",
    "multiparticle interaction effects were neglected ( default in ` herwig ` ) .",
    "additionally , the intrinsic @xmath21 spreading of valence partons in incoming hadrons in ` herwig `  was assumed to be 2.5 gev .    considering this setup",
    ", we always found agreement between ` pythia `  and ` herwig `  predictions within 3% , which is also the effect of including versus neglecting negative weight events in the analysis .",
    "for instance , using our selection cuts and taking into account the negative weight events , we obtained the cross sections @xmath22 and @xmath23 , while without the negative weight events , we obtain @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding value for the ` powhel`+decay case is @xmath25 ( with negative weight events included ) .",
    "these numbers can not be compared directly to the fixed - order prediction @xmath26 quoted in ref.@xcite for two reasons .",
    "on the one hand in ref.@xcite only one lepton family was considered in the decay of the t - quarks , while our prediction contains all three families .",
    "we checked that taking into account only one lepton family in the decay we obtain a factor of three reduction of the cross section as expected . on the other hand",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite also observed that there is a large contribution to the cross section from the emission of a hard jet from the top decay products ( estimated an additional 60% at lo @xcite ) , which is included in our calculation , but not in their value .",
    "as this effect is not known at the nlo accuracy , in order to compare only the shapes of distributions with only decays included , we multiply the nlo predictions with @xmath27 ( shown as ` nlo+decay ' in figs.[fig : ylep ] and  [ fig : ht ] ) .",
    "the lower panels show the ratio of the various predictions to the ` powhel`+`pythia `  one . in order to exhibit the size of the statistical uncertainty ( corresponding to two million lhe events ) , avoiding at the same time a very confusing plot",
    ", we show the uncertainty of only the ` powhel`+decay prediction with errorbars .    in fig.[fig :",
    "ylep ] we compare the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the antilepton at several different levels .",
    "we observe on these plots some general features : ( i ) the two ` powhel`+smc predictions are very close except in bins with low statistics ; ( ii ) the ` powhel`+decay predictions are very close to the nlo ones in the central rapidity region and for the whole @xmath28 range . looking more closely , we find that the spin correlations make the nlo rapidity distribution slightly wider .",
    "the addition of the parton shower makes the rapidity distribution a little even more central due to soft leptons emitted by the shower in central regions .",
    "( for jet rapidities , not shown here , the nlo and ` powhel`+decay predictions coincide , but the shower effect is much more pronounced . ) the @xmath28-distributions of the leptons becomes much softer for the same reason .",
    "the same applies to the @xmath29spectra of the jets .     transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the antilepton .",
    "]     transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the antilepton . ]",
    "we find even larger shower effects in the comparison of the @xmath15-distributions in fig.[fig : ht ] at the decay and smc levels .",
    "the shower makes the distribution softer , readily understood as the effect of unclustered soft hadrons in the event , that appear only in the shower .",
    "distribution of the scalar sum of transverse momenta . ]",
    "we now turn our attention to the lhc and make some predictions for the inclusive t@xmath2 + jet  production at the low - energy run , @xmath30 in the dileptonic final state channel .",
    "we apply the following selection criteria : ( i ) at least three jets are reconstructed with the anti-@xmath7-clustering algorithm with @xmath8 and four - momentum recombination scheme @xcite , ( ii ) @xmath31 , ( iii ) @xmath32 , ( iv ) @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 pairs , while @xmath11 for @xmath36 pairs , ( v ) @xmath37 , @xmath10 for exactly one @xmath38  and one @xmath39 .    for default scales we used two different choices : ( i ) the mass of the t - quark , @xmath40 , and ( ii ) the transverse mass of the harder top , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "we expect the latter scale better interpolates between near - threshold and hard events .    in fig.[fig :",
    "ptjets ] we plot the transverse momentum distributions of the hardest , second hardest and third hardest jet .",
    "these @xmath29  spectra are insensitive to the version of the parton shower within the statistical uncertainty of the computations , which shows that the effect of the missing truncated shower must be small .",
    "also they are rather robust against the choice of the default scale ( 26% variation , not shown here ) , suggesting small scale dependence in general , but we shall study that in a separate publication .",
    "the same features are also true for the rapidity distribution of the antilepton as seen in fig.[fig : yleplhc ] , where we also exhibited the prediction at the decay level . the lower panel shows the ratios of the predictions to the ` powhel`+`herwig `  case .",
    "the error bars represent the statistical uncertainty of the latter only .",
    "we find large ( almost 20% ) and almost uniform effect of the shower and hadronization . in the case of the transverse momentum distribution of the antilepton",
    "the various predictions agree over the whole spectrum except that we see a large increase from the decay level to the full smc at small @xmath28 , see fig.[fig : ptlep ] .",
    "we attribute this increase to the numerous secondary antileptons generated in the hadronization phases .",
    "transverse momentum distributions of the first , second and third hardest jet . ]     rapdity distribution of the antilepton .",

    "the lower plot also includes the ratio of the cross section obtained with @xmath43 to that obtained with @xmath44 ( ` powhel`+`pythia ` ) . ]",
    "finally , we plot the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath38@xmath39  pairs in fig.[fig : mll ] . here again the full smc predictions are all the same . during hadronization",
    "additional ( anti)leptons with @xmath45gev may appear and such events are dropped due to our selection cut ( v ) , resulting in a softer spectrum .",
    "invariant mass distribution of the lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "the lower plot also includes the ratio of the cross section obtained with @xmath46 to that obtained with @xmath44 ( ` powhel`+`pythia ` ) . ]",
    "in this paper we interfaced the ` powheg box `  with the ` helac `  framework to perform nlo calculations matched with parton showers and hadronization in a quite general and semi - automatic way .",
    "the latter means that the necessary ingredients for the ` powheg box `  can be taken from the ` helac `  framework without any further computations .",
    "we presented the feasibility with a non - trivial process , namely inclusive t@xmath2 + jet production and decay , and we found reliable results .",
    "we employed decays as implemented in standard ps monte carlo programs .",
    "we leave the extension to decays included in the hard matrix elements for a future study .",
    "we emphasize that the necessary virtual emission was calculated by a general numerical method which can be used for further processes . due to the general nature of our framework including further processes",
    "is feasible .    using the ` powhel `  framework we produce several million unweighted events at the hadron level readily available for analysis .",
    "these events can be used to produce distributions that are correct at nlo accuracy when expanded in the strong coupling .",
    "our analyses clearly show the importance of the full smc .",
    "there are certain regions in the phase space , where even a nlo accuracy is insufficient .",
    "a singular example is the @xmath47 distribution which shows significant softening over the whole kinematic range .",
