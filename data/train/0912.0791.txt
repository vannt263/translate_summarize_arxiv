    "the curvaton mechanism @xcite is an interesting proposal for explaining the observed scale - invariant primordial density perturbations in the framework of inflation ( and some pioneering works on this mechanism have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "at least two fields are required , in which the curvaton field is subdominant during inflation but becomes dominant after the inflaton decays .",
    "when the curvaton is subdominant it provides entropy ( iso - curvature ) perturbations during inflation , and afterwards , these entropy perturbations can be converted to curvature perturbations when the curvaton starts to dominate the universe .",
    "after the curvaton decays , the universe enters the standard thermal history , and then the primordial curvature perturbations lead to the formation of the large scale structure of our universe@xcite .",
    "recently , a curvaton scenario realized in the frame of stringy inflationary models was presented in ref . @xcite . as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a system of d- and anti - d - branes in a warped throat can be made use of to provide an inflationary stage in the early universe@xcite , and its dynamics is described by a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action in the relativistic limit@xcite .",
    "therefore , the curvaton mechanism realized in this background is the so - called  dbi - curvaton \" , where the curvaton field can be interpreted as a moduli parameter of a d - brane moving in a warped throat@xcite .",
    "however , it is widely recognized that a brane inflation model of dbi - type often suffers from problems of backreaction both from the relativistic brane moving in the warped throat@xcite and from the inflationary background ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) , and so is often unable to provide a enough long inflationary stage required by cosmological observations@xcite .",
    "the original dbi - curvaton model also suffers from the same problem as that of dbi inflation .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", one has to finely tune the precise shape of the potential of the inflaton in the presence of supersymmetrically embedded d7-branes and an anti d3- brane localized at the tip of the warped conifold cone , and therefore the resulting model is rather delicate as studied in refs .",
    "another approach to easing this tension suggests that the motion of a probe brane along the angular coordinates in the internal space can be taken into account to prolong the inflationary period@xcite which relaxed the theoretical constraints from the gravitational backreaction , and so extends the phase space of brane inflation@xcite .    in this paper , we study a new dbi - type curvaton model established on the scenario of multiple brane inflation proposed in refs .",
    "we suggest that a probe anti - d3-brane with angular momentum on the tip of an approximately isometric warped throat can play the role of a curvaton field . specifically , we consider the well - known klebanov - strassler ( ks ) throat @xcite which is a nonsingular deformed conifold with its moduli being stabilized by fluxes@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the anti - d3-brane always sits at the bottom of the deformed throat due to the sum of gravitational and gauge forces .",
    "correspondingly its radial position is nearly fixed and the angular motion can be safely preserved during inflation .    since the specific realization of this curvaton mechanism involves at least two branes with the anti - d3-brane as the curvaton brane , this model can be viewed as an application of the multi - brane inflation model@xcite , and it naturally possesses some features of the multi - brane inflation model . for instance , the spectral index of iso - curvature perturbations generated by the curvaton brane during inflation has a slight red tilt deviating from scale - invariance , and is mainly dependent on the slow - roll parameter characterizing the variation of the hubble parameter during inflation . at cubic order",
    "we find the nonlinear perturbations of a curvaton brane model have the combined features of a usual curvaton model and a dbi - inflation one .",
    "the non - gaussianity of local type nicely agrees with the traditional result obtained in a general curvaton model ; however , the non - gaussianity of equilateral type is amplified by the small sound speed of the curvaton brane which is consistent with the usual scenario of brane inflation .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the dynamics of d- and anti - d - branes in the ks throat . in section iii , we present the realization of the dbi - curvaton in the ks throat and show that the curvaton brane can rotate in the relativistic limit . in section",
    "iv we calculate the curvature perturbations and the non - guassianities generated in this model .",
    "the consistency relationships are analyzed in section v. section vi contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "to begin with , we consider a flux compactification of type iib string theory on an orientifold of a calabi - yau three - fold@xcite .",
    "the geometry of this warped deformed conifold is viewed as a solution to type iib supergravity with the presence of negative tension sources .",
    "it can be explicitly constructed by taking a stack of d3-branes with @xmath0 units of the ramond - ramond ( rr ) fluxes @xmath1 on the @xmath2 ( a - cycle ) and @xmath3 units of the neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) fluxes @xmath4 on the dual cycle ( b - cycle ) which is the @xmath5 times a circle extended along the radial direction .",
    "this gives , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is related to the string mass scale by @xmath8 .",
    "when the fluxes are turned on , they warp the geometry of the conifold and the background metric of the 10d spacetime can be expressed as follows , @xmath9 where the warping factor @xmath10 can be a function of the radius @xmath11 and internal coordinates @xmath12 generically .",
    "additionally , @xmath13 is the metric of 4-dimensional spacetime and @xmath14 characterizes the internal space of the compact manifold .    in the above system , we have only introduced the d3-branes .",
    "the geometry away from the tip of the conifold is an approximately anti - de - sitter ( ads ) form with @xmath15 and the characteristic length scale @xmath16 is fixed by the flux number as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the string coupling which has to satisfy @xmath19 to ensure the validity of the supergravity description@xcite . in order to obtain a de - sitter ( ds ) solution which may be used to realize inflation",
    ", we can introduce anti - d3-branes at the tip of the throat , which can lift the ads vacuum such as the kklt mechanism@xcite .",
    "note that , the warping factor at the infrared ( ir ) end of the throat takes @xmath20 and the ir cutoff of the radial coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "now , we are interested in the dynamics of the branes in the ks throat .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath22-brane will sink to the tip of the throat , while the d3-brane is almost free except attracted by the @xmath22-brane only . to have a quick look , we can write down the effective action for a d3-brane or an @xmath22-brane @xcite , @xmath23 } \\pm t_3 \\int d^4x ( c_4)_{0123}~ ,   \\label{dbi - cs}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 being defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is for d3-brane , @xmath27 for @xmath22 , and the @xmath28 is the tension which is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the equation of motion of the rr field yields , @xmath30 so , if the transverse fluctuations of the brane vanish , we will find that , for d3 , these two contributions to the action cancel exactly ; however , they could sink @xmath22 to the bottom of the throat .    as usual , if the ks throat is isometric , the warp factor @xmath10 is independent of the angular coordinates @xmath31 .",
    "however , in a general case , there are some corrections which make the warp factor dependent on angular coordinates . for example , since the compact c - y manifold can not have exact continuous isometries , the isometries of the bulk must be broken when the finite throat is glued on this bulk , and then the warp factor becomes angular - dependent . since these effects are suppressed by powers of the warp factor , the correction to the warp factor can be described in terms of @xmath32 as analyzed in refs",
    "however , we shall keep in mind that , @xmath33 can not be too large , otherwise the geometry of the ks throat would be distorted seriously .    a nonperturbative effect which stabilizes the k@xmath34hler moduli",
    "could bring a potential for the branes @xcite .",
    "the form of this potential depends on the precise embedding of the wrapped branes , and for embeddings which do not admit supersymmetric vacua on the tip , this potential could be angular - dependent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have provided an estimate of the nonperturbative effect which is dominated by the warp factor in the case of the kuperstein embedding@xcite of the d7-brane , where the angular degrees of freedom obtain a mass term , @xmath35 in which @xmath36 measures the minimal radial location reached by the d7-brane , and @xmath37 characterizes the deformation of the coinfold .    to combine the corrections mentioned above ,",
    "we can obtain the effective action of the @xmath22-brane as follows , @xmath38 } - t_3 \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g } \\left ( h^4 + v_{np } \\right)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 stands for the angular - dependent potential given by the nonperturbative effects , and so is a function of the angular coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "note that we have neglected the interactions among the curvaton and other fields for simplicity .",
    "in addition , even if the isometries of the throat are broken , the dynamics of the brane along the radial direction are almost the same as that in the isometric throat , unless the bulk effects can distort the throat geometry drastically .    at the end of this section",
    "we would like to comment on the tadpole condition which is a limit on the net brane charge .",
    "since the branes carry charges , they can not be inserted into a compact space optionally .",
    "the extra brane charges must be compensated by the background , and thus the following condition has to be satisfied @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the euler number of the c - y manifold , and @xmath42(@xmath43 ) stands for the number of the d3-brane ( @xmath22-brane ) . in the usual case , @xmath41 is of order @xmath44 @xcite , and so it puts an upper bound on the background charge number as @xmath45",
    "within the background introduced in the previous section , now we are able to construct the model of a dbi - curvaton from a @xmath22-brane rotating in the ks throat .",
    "we consider a @xmath22-brane with angular momentum at the tip of the ks throat which is approximately isometric . as",
    "shown in the previous section , this brane is localized in the radial direction .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the angular momenta of the branes could be inflated away if these branes were used to drive inflation . in our construction , we assume that the inflationary background is still driven by a d3-d7 system as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see @xcite for earlier studies ) , the radial coordinate of the @xmath22-brane is nearly fixed , and there exists an external potential from the nonperturbative effect of moduli stabilization which drives the curvaton brane to rotate .",
    "consequently , provided the external potential persists sufficiently long , the angular momentum of the probe brane can safely survive during inflation . in this case , the radial coordinate of the probe brane is around @xmath46 , and thus we can study its dynamics along the angular directions at the tip of the ks throat and its application in the curvaton mechanism . the global scenario of our model is sketched in fig .",

    "this will be studied in following works in the near future .",
    "moreover , there are three angular directions of the @xmath2 tip , and everyone is able to play the role of a curvaton field .",
    "we would like to pick up the flattest direction , and define it as the @xmath48 coordinate , for simplicity .",

    "further , we would like to define an effective potential of the curvaton field as follows , @xmath54 and thus the corresponding effective lagrangian can be written as , @xmath55 of which the form is similar to that of the usual dbi model .",
    "we notice that a similar scenario involving a slow - rotating @xmath22-brane was considered in ref . @xcite and",
    "its action was expanded to quadratic order under the assumption of the non - relativistic limit @xmath56 . in the current work , however , we are going to consider the relativistic dynamics of the model of the curvaton brane with the limit of @xmath57 . in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with the metric characterized by , @xmath58 the equation of motion for the curvaton field @xmath59",
    "is given by @xmath60 where the dot represents the cosmic time derivative , and @xmath61 denotes the derivative of @xmath62 with respect to the scalar field @xmath59 .",
    "one may notice that , since the energy density of the curvaton is secondary during inflation , the hubble parameter @xmath63 is determined by the background d3-d7 inflationary model .    before studying the cosmological perturbations of this model",
    ", we would like to study the evolution of its background equation under the relativistic limit . in the case of @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ soundspeed ] ) yields @xmath65 and it implies that the variation of the curvaton is roughly @xmath66 for a fixed time interval @xmath67 .",
    "besides , as mentioned in section 2 , provided the geometry of the ks throat is not distorted too much , we still have the infrared warp factor @xmath68 . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we have an ansatz with the following form , @xmath69 where we have set @xmath70 at the beginning of inflation .",
    "moreover , eq . ( [ eomb1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath71    to apply the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eomb2 ] ) , we then have the leading terms , which are the second term @xmath72 and the potential term @xmath73 respectively",
    ". the nonperturbative mass term is given by eq .",
    "( [ massnp ] ) , as introduced in section 2 .",
    "the others are suppressed by the slow - varying factor @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is required by inflation ) . by matching the leading terms",
    ", we get the results @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "so we obtain the solution @xmath79 for a relativistic curvaton brane rotating in a warped throat .",
    "notice that the value range of the curvaton is constrained by the radius of the 3-circle at the tip . in the usual case , it restrict the variation of the coordinate along the angular direction @xmath80 to be less than @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , to multiply the hubble parameter on the solution ( [ solution ] ) , the angular restriction brings a constraint on the efolding number of inflation as follows , @xmath82 in addition , the solution ( [ solution ] ) gives a rolling - down behavior for the curvaton field , which in the stringy frame shows that the rotation angle of the curvaton brane becomes more and more parallel to the 3-cycle at the tip , and the angular - dependence will finally vanish .",
    "however , the quantum fluctuation of the curvaton during inflation may be in conflict with its classical variation so that hold the curvaton on the plateau of its potential longer .",
    "therefore , with the help of quantum fluctuation there would be more angular modes preserved , but the model may suffer from the potential tension of large backreaction .",
    "in the above section we have studied the background evolution of the curvaton brane during inflation .",
    "if our model indeed makes sense to the physics of the early universe , it is necessary to study the primordial perturbations generated by the curvaton field .",
    "this provides a potential discriminant between numerous curvaton models in the literature .      to begin with",
    ", we split the curvaton field @xmath59 into @xmath83 , where @xmath84 stands for the background field which is homogeneous and isotropic , and @xmath85 stands for the linear fluctuation which is caused by quantum effects .",
    "following the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in the spatially flat gauge , and assume no couplings to the background inflaton . in this case",
    ", we have the equation of motion describing the canonical perturbation variable in fourier space as follows , @xmath86 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath87 .",
    "the canonical perturbation variable is defined as @xmath88 and a background dependent function is introduced , @xmath89 in the above perturbation equation .",
    "one may notice that eq ( [ eomvk ] ) has an asymptotic solution when we neglect the last term @xmath90 , which implies @xmath91 , and it oscillates strongly like a sine function .",
    "this feature coincides with the slow roll condition defined above , which corresponds to the case in which the effective physical wavelength is deep inside the so - call sound horizon @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the modes can be regarded as states in the adiabatic minkowski vacuum during the sub - hubble regime .",
    "correspondingly , we can impose a suitable initial condition @xmath93 which corresponds to the bunch - davies vacuum .    in the inflationary background",
    ", we have the following useful approximate relation , @xmath94 which implies that the power spectrum of the field fluctuations takes the form @xmath95 after they exit the sound horizon . the subscript ` @xmath96 ' stands for the sound horizon crossing time for the field fluctuation .",
    "since during inflation the hubble parameter is nearly constant and the field fluctuations are almost conserved after sound horizon crossing , we are able to calculate the spectral tilt of the primordial perturbations at the horizon crossing moment .",
    "this is given by @xmath97 where we have defined a series of slow - variation parameters , @xmath98    note that we have ignored the square and the higher derivatives of the slow roll parameters in the above expressions .",
    "the perturbation equation is derived under the assumption that the coupling between the adiabatic and isocurvature modes is negligible .",
    "a more detailed analysis of a similar scenario where an inflation model is based on multiple branes has been given in ref .",
    "thus we can naturally understand the difference in the results obtained in the current model and those obtained in @xcite where multiple moduli degrees of freedom are involved in a single brane . besides , to compare the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ n sigma ] ) with that in the usual curvaton model , we can see that the correction to the spectral index from the mass term disappears in our model , because it is strongly suppressed by a term proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "to proceed , we calculate the curvature perturbations generated by the curvaton field after inflation has ceased and the inflaton field has already decayed to radiation . during this period ,",
    "the energy density of the universe is composed of @xmath100 which denotes the radiation energy density and @xmath101 which is contributed by the curvaton . in this stage ,",
    "the curvature perturbations are generated from the isocurvature modes since the pressure perturbations are non - adiabatic .",
    "this process ends when the perturbations become adiabatic again , which corresponds to the epoch of curvaton domination , or that of curvaton decay .",
    "the final curvature perturbations can be calculated at the moment @xmath102 based on the assumption of perturbatively instantaneous reheating of the curvaton . in that case",
    "we can simply consider the component curvature perturbations @xmath103 and @xmath104 on slices of uniform curvaton density and radiation density separately . according to the assumptions of the curvaton mechanism",
    ", we can neglect the perturbations from radiation and thus have the curvature perturbation expressed as , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is defined as the equation - of - state of the curvaton , and @xmath103 is given by @xmath107    as emphasized in section ii , the nonperturbative effect which stabilizes the k@xmath34hler moduli in the case of the kuperstein embedding yields a quadratic potential for the curvaton brane as given in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) . therefore , after inflation the curvaton field arrives at its vacuum state and starts to oscillate when @xmath108 . at that moment , the sound speed @xmath109 goes to @xmath110 , and the energy density of the curvaton field redshifts proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "so we have an approximate equation - of - state @xmath112 for the curvaton . in this case the energy density of the curvaton is dominated by its potential , which in the oscillating epoch roughly takes the form @xmath113 where the first term is secondary in the oscillating epoch as will be explained in the next section .",
    "one can obtain the linear perturbation of the curvaton energy density in the oscillating epoch as follows , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the amplitude at the beginning of its sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "it can be viewed as a function of the curvaton field @xmath116 at hubble exit , which is the only relevant quantity since the perturbations from the radiation fluid is supposed to be negligible .",
    "the curvature perturbation is calculated at the moment of curvaton decay , so it is convenient to define a parameter @xmath117 which characterizes the fraction of curvaton component when it starts to decay .",
    "consequently , at fixed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we obtain the curvature perturbation at linear order as follows , @xmath120 where we have applied the result presented in eq .",
    "( [ delta sigma ] ) as well as the approximate relation @xmath121 when the oscillation starts with @xmath108 .      in the above section",
    "we have studied the primordial perturbations at linear order .",
    "it is necessary to extend the theoretical framework of this model beyond the leading order .",
    "particularly , the investigation of non - gaussianities may provide a powerful discriminator among numerous models describing the early universe .",
    "for example , non - gaussianities in a single canonical field inflation model were calculated in pioneering works @xcite and found to be very small .",
    "later , studies of dbi inflation models@xcite predicted that a large non - gaussianity of equilateral type can be realized in inflationary cosmology@xcite .",

    "the amplification of non - gaussianities from @xmath148 is inherited from the physical feature of a general curvaton model .",

    "this effect is negligible provided @xmath158@xcite , and so gives a bound on the sound speed of the curvaton brane @xmath159 during inflation .    combining the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe five year ( wmap5 ) data @xcite with the distance measurements from the type ia supernovae ( sn ) @xcite and the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the distribution of galaxies @xcite , the parameters of primordial cosmological perturbations have been accurately determined by a group of stringent limits as follows : @xmath160 , @xmath161 at the pivot scale @xmath162 , @xmath163 at the @xmath164 level with a prior assumption of no running of the spectral index , and further @xmath165 and @xmath166 at the @xmath164 level for the local and equilateral limits , respectively .",
    "moreover , the number of efoldings of inflation is also constrained by cosmological observations .",
    "however , the reheating process after the primordial epoch is quite model - dependent and critically dependent on the reheating temperature . up to now",
    ", the allowed reheating temperature can be anywhere between @xmath167 and @xmath168 in principle .",
    "so it makes the measurement of the inflationary efolding number undetermined . in the current work ,",
    "we take the simplest example of instantaneous curvaton reheating where the curvaton decays to standard - model particles momentarily once @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we simply assume the inflationary efolding number takes the value @xmath169 , which is a quite reasonable value allowed by observations .",
    "we would like to leave the more detailed study of the reheating process of the curvaton brane model to future studies .",
    "additionally , there is one extra theoretical constraints from the requirement that the scalar perturbations generated by the inflaton field should be negligible during the period of curvaton oscillations .",
    "we assume that the inflaton field satisfies the traditional slow - roll conditions , and hence the curvature perturbation during inflation are given by the power spectrum @xmath170 .",
    "similar to the definition of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , one can define a new parameter @xmath171 which has to satisfy the condition @xmath172 .",
    "taking into account all the conditions introduced above , we find the available stringy parameters most stringently constrained by observations are @xmath18 and @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] , [ fig : b ] and [ fig : c ] , we present our numerical calculations of the permitted regime for @xmath18 and @xmath0 by fixing the total charge number of the background @xmath173 .",
    "our results imply that the allowed phase space of the @xmath18-@xmath0 plane with a large @xmath173 is much bigger than that with a small one .",
    "this feature is similar to that of a traditional dbi inflation model , where a large value of @xmath173 can provide a small enough warp factor ; however , the limits on stringy parameters are much weaker in our case .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the particular feature of our model that the curvaton position keeps still during the epoch of inflation .     and",
    "@xmath0 from current observations , assuming a curvaton - dominated universe after inflation .",
    "the blue region is allowed by current observations . in the numerical computation , @xmath174 and @xmath175",
    "are chosen as priors . ]     and @xmath0 from current observations , assuming a curvaton - dominated universe after inflation .",
    "the green region is allowed by current observations . in the numerical computation , @xmath176 and @xmath175",
    "are chosen as priors . ]     and @xmath0 from current observations , assuming a curvaton - dominated universe after inflation .",
    "the orange region is allowed by current observations . in the numerical computation , @xmath177 and @xmath175",
    "are chosen as priors . ]",
    "in addition to the constraints on the stringy parameters performed above , we can also obtain the constraint on the slow - roll parameter @xmath178 as @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , in order to make sure that the equilateral non - gaussianity generated in our model is consistent with the wmap5 data , the fraction of curvaton density @xmath148 in the oscillating epoch needs to be of order @xmath81 .",
    "this is self - consistent with the previous assumption that the universe is dominated by the curvaton field after inflation .",
    "to conclude , in this section we have confronted our model with the latest cosmological observations . under the priors of the inflationary efolding number and the background charge number , we derived that there is a sizable allowed region for the phase space of this model .",
    "it illustrates that cosmological observations can be nicely satisfied in our model .",
    "however , it is crucial to perform a global analysis which combines both the stringy parameters appearing in the model and the standard cosmological parameters without any artificial assumptions .",
    "we will leave this work to a future study .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a curvaton model obtained by considering a @xmath22-brane in a ks throat with approximate isometries from string theory . in this model ,",
    "a @xmath22-brane is stretched out along the 4d external space , and can be localized at the tip of the ks throat because of the gauge forces . adding the nonperturbative effect of the k@xmath34hler moduli stabilization , its angular coordinates can play a role of the curvaton while the other degrees of freedom ( for example , the radial motion of the @xmath22-brane ) are almost frozen . this scenario can be embedded into the framework of inflation models in terms of multiple branes , in which the @xmath22-brane rotates relativistically .",
    "based on the formulae developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we have studied the background evolution and the primordial perturbations of this curvaton model .",
    "the solution of the background dynamics of the curvaton is consistent with the assumptions of the nonperturbative potential of moduli stabilization , and so ensures the feasibility of our model .",
    "the process of converting the primordial fluctuations of the curvaton into curvature perturbations takes place after inflation , and is similar to what happens in the usual curvaton mechanism .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the final curvature perturbations are calculated under the assumption that the curvaton decays immediately after the oscillation period ceases .",
    "such a fast decay rate is also suggested by the stringy reheating configuration , in which one needs to turn on certain susy - breaking deformations of the ks background@xcite in order to avoid redundant long - lived kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes@xcite and have a correct relic density for dm candidates@xcite .",
    "however , the precise duration of the decay process is not addressed in the current work .",
    "this would alter the efficiency of the conversion of curvature perturbations and the precise determination of the inflationary efolding number .",
    "our model is related to many other interesting issues which deserve intensive studies in the future .",
    "for example , as mentioned below eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) , this model is expected to possess nontrivial kinetic couplings at fourth order from the geometric brane deformation .",
    "therefore it may leave important signals on the trispectra which would render the model distinguishable from other multi - field inflation models with non - standard kinetic terms@xcite .",
    "in addition , a lesson from string theory suggests that a more reasonable expression of the multi - brane dynamics ought to be described by a matrix in the framework of nonabelian background@xcite , which shows a potential connection between the multi - brane scenario and the matrix inflation model investigated recently@xcite .",
