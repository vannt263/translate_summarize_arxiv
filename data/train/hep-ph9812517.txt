    "the study of contact interactions ( ci ) is a powerful way to search for departures from the standard model and to parametrise new physics phenomena .",
    "phenomenologically at an energy scale much lower than the characteristic scale of the underlying theory , very different new physics contributions can give rise to very similar changes in processes involving only sm particles .",
    "the presence of new interactions can then be written in terms of an effective ci lagrangian in a model - independent way . in the context of hera",
    "the lepton - quark ci of the first generation fermions are the most interesting since they can manifest themselves in @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the most general @xmath1 current - current effective lagrangian has the form @xcite : @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the effective mass scale of the contact interaction .",
    "the sign @xmath5 characterises the nature of the interference of each ci term with the standard model @xmath6 and @xmath7 exchange amplitudes .",
    "the subscripts @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the chiral structure of the new interaction . in a purely phenomenological approach",
    "all @xmath12 s are unknown parameters , whereas they are predicted in a given theoretical framework . for example , the structure of @xmath13 in a generic leptoquark model or in supersymmetry with @xmath14-parity violation can be found in ref  @xcite .",
    "the overwhelming success of the sm suggests that the ci lagrangian must be @xmath15 symmetric .",
    "the symmetry implies that @xmath16 , relates @xmath17 and @xmath18 nc interactions , and relates the difference @xmath19 to the cc @xmath20 contact term .",
    "the lepton - hadron universality of charged - current data indicates that the latter is small .",
    "hera will be most sensitive to ci terms in measurements at large @xmath21 which favours large @xmath22 where the leading contribution comes from the valence @xmath23-quark .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we will assume _ u - d _ universality , _",

    "stringent bounds of the order of @xmath28 tev for the individual ci terms are found",
    ". however , when several terms of different chiralities are involved simultaneously , cancellations occur and the resulting bounds on @xmath29 are considerably weaker and of the order of @xmath30 tev @xcite .",
    "present bounds from hera as well as from other high - energy experiments are of the same order of magnitude and it can therefore be expected that experiments at hera will be able to improve the limits with increasing luminosity .",
    "in this note we want to emphasize that the measurement of spin asymmetries , defined in the context of hera with polarized lepton beams ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and/or with polarized lepton and proton beams , could provide very important tools to disentangle the chiral structure of the new interaction . to illustrate the point we will consider an example with double spin asymmetries defined in eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) below .",
    "the details of a more complete phenomenological analysis of the experimental signatures of ci from the measurements of cross sections and spin asymmetries in the nc channel at hera can be found in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite has been motivated by the renewed interest in the polarization option , considered already at an early stage of the hera project ( see for example @xcite ) , and more recently in @xcite ; we also refer to the report of the working group 6 in these proceedings .    when we discuss polarized beams we split equally the expected total integrated luminosity of 1 fb@xmath33 among various configurations of beams and polarizations , _ i.e. _ for both lepton and proton beams polarized , we assume a luminosity of 125 pb@xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 with longitudinally polarized leptons ( @xmath36 ) and protons ( @xmath37 ) . as a result ,",
    "the `` discovery potential '' ( as far as the sensitivity to the scale @xmath29 is concerned ) is not significantly improved by running with polarized beams as compared to the unpolarized case , see table 1 . there",
    "the 95% cl limits for @xmath29 s obtained from the analysis of unpolarized @xmath34 and @xmath35 collisions ( upper row ) are compared to the ones obtained with the help of polarized beams ( lower row ) . in the latter case the following double - spin asymmetries )",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once new physics effects are observed , polarized beams are very useful since the @xmath21 dependence of spin asymmetries contains additional information which is sensitive to the chiral structure .",

    "the main conclusions are the following : + 1 ) the hera collider with an integrated luminosity of @xmath50 fb@xmath33 will give strong bounds on the energy scale of a possible new ci . for constructive interferences ,",
    "the limit on @xmath29 is of the order of @xmath51 , and for destructive interferences we get @xmath52 .",

    "+ 3 ) since in the proton the valence @xmath53-quark distribution is dominant , the measurements essentially constrain the presence of a new interaction in the @xmath54 sector . to constrain a new interaction in @xmath55 sector , protons could be replaced by neutrons , for example by using electron-@xmath56 collisions , an option which is also under consideration at hera @xcite .",
