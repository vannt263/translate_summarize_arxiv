    "the top quark is the heaviest particle so far discovered , with a mass close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , and closely related to various new physics models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus it provides an effective probe for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and the new physics beyond the sm through studying its production and decay at colliders .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is running now with a center of mass energy @xmath4 , and will collect 1 @xmath5 experimental data during the initial run .",
    "after this initial state the lhc will turn to @xmath6 , with a design luminosity of @xmath7 there will be @xmath8 top quark pairs and @xmath9 single top quarks produced yearly . as a result of all these , the precision measurement of the top quark properties , such as the mass , the production cross sections , the kinematic distributions , and the spin correlation effects , will be one of the prime tasks in the experiments at the lhc , and any deviations from the sm predictions will definitely be a hint for new physics beyond the sm .    to explore the connections between the new physics and the top quark ,",
    "one possibility is to study the top quark pair invariant mass distribution and look for possible resonances since many new physics models predict the existence of a new resonance with a mass around @xmath10 , which can decay into a top quark pair , such as the technicolor  @xcite , topcolor  @xcite , little higgs  @xcite , general @xmath1 models  @xcite , and randall - sundrum ( rs ) models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in many such models the interaction between the heavy resonance and the top quark is enhanced as compared to the other fermions and the resonance will mainly decay into a top quark pair , for example , the kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the graviton  @xcite , the gluon  @xcite as well as the weak gauge bosons  @xcite in the extended rs models .",
    "once we have discovered such a resonance in the top quark pair invariant mass distribution , the next step is to measure its spin and couplings , and finally determine the underlying new physics dynamics , which have been studied in refs .",
    "it has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that it is possible to extract the spin and coupling information of the resonance from the top quark polar angle distributions and the spin correlations of the top quark pair .",
    "those studies were carried out at the leading - order ( lo ) in qcd interactions .",
    "however , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections may be large , for example , the nlo qcd corrections can enhance the cross sections of the single rs kk graviton or the @xmath1 production by about @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite respectively , so it is necessary to examine whether the qcd corrections will change the tree - level results and some conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite or not . in this paper",
    "we investigate the nlo qcd effects to a heavy resonance production and decay into a top quark pair , i.e. , @xmath13 , at the lhc , where the @xmath14 color singlet state @xmath15 could be either a rs kk graviton @xmath0 or an extra gauge boson @xmath1 .",

    "[ s5 ] is a brief summary .",
    "the appendix collects some analytic results at the lo .",
    "in the rs model , a single extra dimension is compactified on a @xmath16 orbifold with a radius @xmath17 , which is not too large as compared to the planck length .",
    "two 3-branes , the planck brane and the tev brane , are located at the orbifold fixed points @xmath18 , respectively , and the spacetime between the two 3-branes is simply a slice of a five - dimensional anti - de sitter geometry .",
    "the five - dimensional warped metric is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the five - dimensional coordinate , and @xmath21 is the curvature scale . by requiring @xmath22",
    ", one can suppress the planck scale to @xmath23 on the tev brane , and then solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the gravity fields are treated as fluctuations under the background metric , and after expanding the gravity fields in the extra dimension we get infinite massive kk gravitons , which can interact with the sm fields  @xcite .",
    "the rs kk graviton can be produced through both the @xmath24 fusion and the @xmath25 annihilation at the lo as shown in fig .",
    "the detailed feynman rules of the graviton couplings can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the propagator of the graviton in the unitary gauge in @xmath26 dimensions is given by  @xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass and the width of the heavy resonance , respectively .",
    "the extra gauge boson @xmath1 could arise from an additional @xmath31 gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it could also be the kk excitation of the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "it can only be produced through the @xmath25 annihilation at the lo , and its generic couplings to quarks are as follow @xmath32 we considered four combinations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , the pure vector coupling , @xmath35 , the axial - vector coupling , @xmath36 , the right - handed coupling , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and the left - handed coupling , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which are denoted by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the propagator of the @xmath1 in the unitary gauge is given by @xmath45    in our calculations of the process @xmath13 , what we mainly concern about are the ratios of the nlo results to the lo ones , so it is not necessary to specify the actual values of all the couplings .",
    "we simply assume the mass of the heavy resonance to be around @xmath10 scale , which is not yet excluded by the current experiments . besides , we only consider the narrow resonance cases and fix @xmath46 at both the lo and the nlo .",
    "we do not expect our conclusions to be largely modified even if @xmath47 increases to be at the order of 10% .",
    "detailed discussions on the sm backgrounds and the discovery potential of the process can be found in refs .",
    "the complete nlo qcd corrections to the process @xmath48 can be factorized into two independent gauge invariant parts , i.e. , the heavy resonance produced at the nlo with a subsequent decay at the lo , and produced at the lo with a subsequent decay at the nlo , similar to the cases studied in ref .",
    "the box diagrams , and the corresponding real correction diagrams , that connect the initial and the final states do not contribute to the squared matrix elements up to the nlo as the heavy resonance is a @xmath14 color singlet particle .",
    "this whole procedure can be illustrated as follows @xmath49 we have suppressed the possible lorentz indices here for simplicity .",
    "we calculate the full squared matrix elements using the propagators ( @xmath50 ) of the heavy resonance given in sec .  [ s2 ] , which can incorporate the full spin correlations between the production and decay processes in order to generate the correct kinematic distributions .",
    "we carry out all the qcd calculations in the t hooft - feynman gauge and use the dimension regularization scheme  @xcite ( with the naive @xmath51 prescription  @xcite ) in @xmath52 dimensions to regularize all the divergences .",

    "in our numerical calculations we choose the input parameters to be @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55  @xcite . the running qcd coupling constant",
    "is evaluated at the three - loop order  @xcite with @xmath56 , and the cteq6 m ( cteq6l1 ) parton distribution function ( pdf ) set  @xcite is used through the nlo ( lo ) calculations .",
    "we set both the renormalization and factorization scales equal to the mass of the heavy resonance , unless specified . besides , in the two cutoff phase slicing method there are two arbitrary cutoff parameters , i.e. , the soft cutoff @xmath57 and the collinear cutoff @xmath58 .",
    "we have checked the cutoff dependence of all our numerical results , and found that the dependence is negligibly small for @xmath59 , so we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 to obtain the numerical results presented below .      in fig .",

    "the nlo corrections from the production part are dominant , while the ones from the decay part are relatively small , but can still reach above ten percent in some regions .",

    "at the same time we can also use the @xmath75 distribution to distinguish between the @xmath76 and the @xmath77 since the latter ones have a large forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , the differences of the polar angle distributions between the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 are very small for @xmath29 around @xmath78 or heavier , thus it is not possible to separate them through the polar angle distributions .",

    ", we can see that for all the @xmath1 the changes of the distributions are negligibly small , which are no more then a few percent .",
    "but for the @xmath0 , as the increasing of the resonance mass the nlo corrections can change the shapes of the distributions , for example , the nlo corrections make the distributions decrease more quickly at the both ends and can reach about 10% for @xmath71 .",
    "the corrections can be as large as 30% , and change the shapes of the distributions significantly for @xmath72 , which do not change the fact that the distributions of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 are greatly different .",
    "note that for a heavy enough resonance , the top quarks produced are highly boosted , which means the decay products of the top quark are close to each other and form a top jet .",
    "recently , several methods based on the jet substructures have been proposed  @xcite , which may be used to detect such a top jet efficiently , so it is possible to measure the nlo qcd effects to the polar angle distributions for a graviton with a mass of several @xmath10 at the lhc .",

    "we also studied all the above distributions at the lhc with @xmath80 , and the results are similar .",
    "one of the unique features of the top quark is that it decays before the strong interaction can depolarize its spin .",
