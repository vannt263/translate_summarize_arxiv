    "oppositely , _ prediction _",
    "denotes a statement about future events based on the knowledge of past occurrences .",
    "predictions and retrodictions are commonplace in everyday life .",
    "we make predictions when we place a bet on a horse ; when we arrange the time for a date ; when we forecast a heavy rainfall for the weekend ; and when we invest in the stock market .",
    "retrodictions are made when a sommelier infers the production year of a wine from tasting ; when a detective closes a case on the ground of the gathered evidences ; when a radio operator reconstructs a message from a morse code ; and when we guess the production cost of an item from its quality .",
    "alas , things do not go so smoothly when dealing with predictions and retrodictions in the realm of physics .",
    "the problems are rooted in the profoundly different descriptions of nature provided by classical and quantum physics .",
    "the natural world as perceived by our senses is ruled by the laws of classical physics established by galileo , newton , maxwell , and few others over the past centuries .",
    "however , the microscopic world of atoms , photons and elementary particles obeys the strange laws of quantum mechanics formulated about a century ago by planck , einstein , schrdinger , heisenberg et alii .",
    "thus , classical and quantum mechanics offer two different , and often irreconcilable , representations of the physical world .",
    "a consequence thereof , is the rise of deceptive inconsistencies in the quantum mechanical formalism when viewed through the lens of classical mechanics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one of such `` flaws '' is the so - called retrodiction paradox due to the apparent time - asymmetry in quantum state reduction .",
    "a facet of this interesting problem has been vividly illustrated in the context of quantum optics by sir roger penrose in his bestseller book _ the road to reality _",
    "@xcite , as follows .",
    "consider a light source @xmath0 emitting one photon towards a photodetector @xmath1 , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "midway between @xmath0 and @xmath1 the @xmath2 beam splitter @xmath3 can either transmit or reflect the incoming photon with equal probability @xmath4 . in the former case the photon reaches the detector @xmath1 and",
    "is recorded . in the latter case",
    "the photon hits the ceiling @xmath5 and is absorbed .",
    "given that the source had emitted a photon at time @xmath6 , quantum mechanics _ predicts _ that at a sufficiently later time @xmath7 there is @xmath8 probability of a detection event at @xmath1 and @xmath8 probability of a photon being absorbed by @xmath5 .",
    "so far so good .",

    "if this probability were not @xmath10 we would implicitly admit that the detected photon could have been emitted by the floor @xmath11 and `` this , of course , is an absurdity '' , in penrose s words .",
    "nonetheless , according to penrose , quantum mechanics precisely _ retrodicts _ that there is @xmath8 probability that the detected photon was emitted by the source @xmath0 and @xmath8 probability for emission by the floor @xmath11 .",
    "why ?    if we content ourselves with a _",
    "formal _ answer , this can be easily given as follows . to begin with ,",
    "let us recall that the first postulate of quantum mechanics is that under certain conditions a physical system can be represented by a _",
    "_ state vector _ _ in an abstract linear space known as _",
    "hilbert space _ @xcite .",
    "thus , let @xmath12 be the state vector associated to the photon emitted by @xmath0 at time @xmath6 to denote quantum state vectors . ] . applying the standard rules of quantum mechanics",
    "it is not difficult to show that at later time @xmath7 the state vector of the photon is @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the photon aimed at @xmath1 and @xmath15 describes the photon directed at @xmath5 .",
    "both states have the same probability @xmath4 of occurrence .",
    "now , consider the hypothetical situation depicted in figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) where the source is located on the floor @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the state vector representing the photon emitted by this source at @xmath6 .",
    "proceeding as before , at @xmath7 the state of the photon will be @xmath17 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given as above .",
    "a pictorial representation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and their connections with the vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 is given in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "+ as shown in this illustration , given at @xmath6 the _ unique _ initial vector @xmath12 , there are _ two _ different state vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 associated to it at @xmath9 ( light - blue forward arrows ) . however ,",
    "when going backwards in time , to each state vector @xmath14 and @xmath15 are associated _ both _ input states @xmath12 and @xmath16 ( light - blue and light - orange backward arrows ) . of course",
    ", @xmath12 and @xmath16 describe two very distinct physical situations : @xmath12 represents the state of the photon emitted by the source at @xmath0 ( figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , while @xmath16 describes the state of the photon emitted by the source at @xmath11 ( figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "nonetheless , both vector states end up at @xmath20 into a @xmath21 superpositions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( with different phases ) .",
    "this simply means that irrespective of the location of the source , the emitted photon has @xmath8 probability of exciting the detector @xmath1 and @xmath8 probability of being absorbed by @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , given _ the sole information _ that a photon has been detected by @xmath1 , it seems that quantum mechanics can not retrodict correctly the position of the source , namely can not discriminate between @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is the formal reason for the peculiar quantum mechanical retrodiction for the present problem .    in this work we aim at giving a substantial ,",
    "as opposed to formal , answer to the question posed by penrose s quantum retrodiction paradox .",
    "surprisingly enough , we find that the substantial answer strongly differs from the formal one , thus revealing that , de facto , _ there is no retrodiction paradox _ in the form presented by penrose .",
    "we begin our study by showing in the next section that , according to despagnat @xcite , a retrodiction paradox may originate from an incorrect handling of the information obtained from measurement processes . then , in the third section we show that some of the alleged inconsistencies in penrose s quantum optics retrodiction problem already deceptively appear in the corresponding classical optics retrodiction problem .",
    "finally , by means of a concrete and fully developed example , in the penultimate section we demonstrate that , contrarily to penrose s claim , quantum mechanics does indeed correctly retrodict the position of the light source , provided that _ enough information _ about the system is correctly extracted from the measurements . in the last section we draw our conclusions",

    "@xmath24 : @xmath25 where the complex amplitude @xmath26 ( the asterisk symbol `` @xmath27 '' denotes complex conjugation ) is defined as the scalar product between the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 which are supposed to have unit norm , namely @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "moreover , state vectors @xmath23 and @xmath29 associated to mutually exclusive events are _ orthogonal _ , that is @xmath30 . for example , the photon in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) is either aiming at @xmath1 or directed to the ceiling @xmath5 and , consequently , @xmath31 . therefore , according to these rules and using , the probability that the photon emitted at @xmath6 from the source @xmath0 will be detected by detector @xmath1 at @xmath32 is straightforwardly calculated as @xmath33 analogously , given that a photon has been detected by @xmath1 at time @xmath34 , the probability that it was emitted by @xmath0 is by definition @xmath35 where the symmetry - property has been used .",
    "therefore , quantum - mechanical calculations seem to confirm the existence of penrose s paradox .",
    "then , where is the flaw ?",
    "well , the problem arises from equation , when we assign the state @xmath14 to the photon as consequence of the fact that it has been detected by @xmath1 . as remarked by despagnat ( sec .",
    "13.2 , p. 155 of @xcite ) , from the sole information of a detection event at @xmath1 , we can not infer that the photon was in the state @xmath14 already before detection ; this is simply an incorrect use of such information . as a matter of fact , after the beam - splitter @xmath3 the photon becomes a nonlocal object , namely it is not either reflected _ or _ transmitted by @xmath3 ; rather it is both reflected _ and _ transmitted . if we disregard that part of information contained in the state vector @xmath15 describing the reflected photon , we can not hope to make a correct retrodiction .",
    "the same is trivially true in classical mechanics : if many people placed in different positions fire simultaneously a bullet into a target ( think of a firing squad ) , from the sole position of a bullet stuck in the target , we can not infer who had fired it .",
    "however , if we had more information , such as the direction of the flying bullet before being stuck into the target , we could make a correct retrodiction .",

    "second , we want to show that `` penrose s quantum retrodiction paradox '' illustrated in the previous section in the context of quantum optics , also becomes deceptively manifest at the level of classical optics .",
    "classical and quantum mechanics offer two different representations of natural world .",
    "nonetheless , a physical system _ per se _ should not be regarded as either inherently classical or quantum .",
    "rather , is the way we interact with the system that determines how we represent it . as a matter of fact ,",
    "underlying the concepts of classical and quantum physics , there is the notion that a clear distinction between a system obeying the laws of classical physics and one governed by quantum mechanics , can be made .",
    "however , it is not always clear ( sometime even meaningless ) , where to draw the conceptual line that separates the classical representation of a physical system from the quantum one @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , a bottle of volume @xmath36 containing hydrogen gas at pressure @xmath37 and temperature @xmath34 . in these conditions ,",
    "the gas may be regarded as a _ classical _ thermodynamic system whose behavior is ruled by an equation of state of the form @xmath38 this equation can be deduced by assuming that the hydrogen gas obeys the laws of classical physics without actually referring to the atomic constituents of the gas . moreover ,",
    "the relation @xmath39 can be experimentally verified by actually measuring pressure and temperature of the gas in the bottle with ordinary measuring apparatuses .",
    "imagine now to take the same bottle and to use the gas as a sample for a spectroscopic experiment aimed at determining the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen",
    ". of course , the result of such experiment would be the `` discovery '' of a discrete spectrum consisting of a numerable set of isolated spectral lines .",
    "notably , this characteristic of the spectrum of the hydrogen gas can be predicted only by using the laws of _ quantum _ physics .",
    "therefore , we arrived at the apparent contradiction of having a physical system , the bottle filled with hydrogen gas , obeying _ both _ the laws of classical and quantum physics .",
    "where is the border between classical and quantum physics here ?",
    "the lesson to be learned from this simple example is that a unique physical system may admit diverse representations all equally valid .",
    "thence , our bottle of hydrogen gas may be regarded either as a classical system if we are concerned with its thermodynamical properties , or as a quantum system if we are interested to the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen . of course , the nature of the system is the same in both cases , it is only the way we look at it ( interaction ) that requires either a classical or a quantum description @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we provide for a classical - optics interpretation of penrose s retrodiction paradox , where the single - photon quantum source @xmath0 in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) is replaced by a bright classical source as , e.g. , a slide projector or a photographic flash . according to penrose",
    ", the quantum retrodiction paradox is due to the inherent time - asymmetry in what he calls the `` * * r * * procedure '' , which is a name for the _ state - vector reduction _ or _ collapse of the wavefunction _",
    "( see section 22.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "in classical optics , there is not such a thing as the * r * procedure because states of light admitting a classical description are represented as smoothly and continuously varying waves .",
    "therefore , we could justifiably expect that a retrodiction paradox can not become manifest in the realm of classical optics .",
    "surprisingly enough , here we demonstrate this is not the case because penrose s reasoning leading to the quantum paradox can be mostly repeated step by step in the classical case .    to this end , consider again the system illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) and imagine to replace the single - photon quantum source at @xmath0 with a still random but bright classical source , say a photographic flash . then",
    ", suppose that a burst of light is emitted towards the detector @xmath1 . at beam - splitter , @xmath8 of the light",
    "will be transmitted in the direction of the detector @xmath1 and @xmath8 will be reflected to the ceiling @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , whenever there is an emission event at @xmath0 with intensity @xmath40 , there must be an intensity @xmath41 registered by detector @xmath1 and an intensity @xmath41 absorbed by the ceiling @xmath5 .",
    "this is what classical optics and experiments tell us .",
    "now , quoting penrose , `` [ ... ] _ let us imagine reading this particular experiment backwards in time .",
    "so , assume that the detector @xmath1 had just recorded a flash of light of intensity @xmath41 .",
    "then the relevant question is : where does this light come from ?",
    "evidently , it can not come from the ceiling @xmath5 because light emitted by the ceiling is either reflected towards the source or transmitted in the direction of the floor @xmath11 .",
    "the only remaining possibilities are that _ a _ ) light of intensity @xmath40 was emitted by the floor @xmath11 ; and _ b _ ) light of intensity @xmath40 was emitted by the source @xmath0 and the source @xmath0 .",
    "if this were the case , we should have considered two additional instances , accounting for when _ c _ ) @xmath11 and @xmath0 emitted together _",
    "incoherent _ light of intensity @xmath41 ; and _ d _ ) @xmath11 and @xmath0 emitted simultaneously _",
    "coherent _ light of intensity @xmath42 . ] . both of these two possibilities must have @xmath8 probability of occurrence like in the quantum case because , as remarked by penrose , the ratio of the intensities of the transmitted and reflected light is just an intrinsic property of the beam splitter , irrespective of the either quantum or classical nature of light .",
    "thus , remarkably , classical optics led us to exactly the same conclusions as quantum optics !    of course , in the classical - optics case no one would seriously consider the hypothesis that the flash was emitted by the floor ( who pays for the bill ? ) on the other hand , if we imagine to propagate backwards from the detector a packet of light of intensity @xmath40 , this would certainly split at in two packets of intensity @xmath41 each , one directed towards @xmath0 and the other aimed at @xmath11 .",
    "however , this can not be correct because in the time - forward motion there was not light emitted from @xmath11 .",
    "this apparent inconsistency of the classical - optics ( and quantum too ! ) description , is actually a trivial consequence of our _ incomplete _ reconstruction of the motion of light .",
    "if we had propagated backwards _ also _ the light absorbed by the ceiling ( which , though , we had not detected ) , this would have summed _ coherently _ at with the light coming from @xmath1 . as a result of this coherent process",
    ", we would have had constructive light interference in the direction of the source , and destructive interference towards the floor .",
    "this completely solves the classical - optics version of penrose s retrodiction paradox .",

    "a short quantum - mechanical description thereof has already been provided in the introduction . however , as it will be clear soon , a _",

    "first of all , as penrose contemplated the occurrence of the very improbable event of a photon emitted by the floor @xmath11 , we have to account for such instance in a proper quantum - mechanical way . to this end , consider a deterministic single - photon source @xmath43 followed by a beam splitter @xmath44 with high reflectance @xmath45 and low transmittance @xmath46 , as shown in the bottom - right part of figure [ fig3 ] @xcite .",
    "+ when @xmath43 emits a photon , there is only a tiny probability @xmath47 of the photon reaching the beam splitter @xmath3 .",
    "this process is thus equivalent to a photon being emitted by the floor with probability @xmath48 . to check whether the photon has been actually transmitted towards @xmath3 or not , we monitor the output port @xmath49 of @xmath44 with the detector @xmath50 .",
    "when the last does not click , a photon is aiming at @xmath3 .",
    "the main source present in the setup of figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) is @xmath0 .",
    "a realistic quantum - mechanical description of it must account for a conceivable limited emission efficiency and/or losses .",
    "again , we model such imperfect source @xmath0 as an ideal source @xmath51 followed by a beam - splitter @xmath52 with low reflectance @xmath53 and high transmittance @xmath54 , as shown in the top - left part of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "when @xmath51 emits a photon , there is almost @xmath10 probability of the photon reaching the beam splitter @xmath3 because @xmath55 .",
    "then , to test whether the photon has been transmitted through @xmath52 or not , we observe the output port @xmath56 of @xmath52 with the detector @xmath57 .",
    "the last modification of the setup of figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) is about the absorbing ceiling @xmath5 . in order to achieve complete information about the state of the two photons emitted by @xmath51 and @xmath43",
    ", we must replace @xmath5 with the detector @xmath58 at the output port @xmath59 of @xmath3 ; at a later stage we can always decide whether to use this additional information or not . at the other port ( number @xmath60 ) of the last , we put the detector @xmath61 which has the same role of @xmath1 in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "to summarize , a realistic quantum - mechanical representation of the layout presented in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) requires the presence of two ideal deterministic sources @xmath51 and @xmath43 , four field modes labeled @xmath60 through @xmath49 and four detectors @xmath61 , @xmath58 , @xmath57 and @xmath50 eventually coupled to the modes @xmath62 and @xmath49 , respectively , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "mode @xmath60 is combined with mode @xmath56 by the beam splitter @xmath52 and mode @xmath59 is combined with mode @xmath49 by the beam splitter @xmath44 . at last , modes @xmath60 and @xmath59 are coupled by the beam splitter @xmath3 which , according to the example suggested by penrose , has reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "all beam splitters are supposed to be lossless .",
    "let @xmath65 be an index labelling the four modes of the system shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "each mode can be populated by @xmath66 photons . when the mode @xmath67 is not excited ( @xmath68 ) its quantum state is denoted as _ vacuum state _ and is represented by the vector @xmath69 .",
    "when the mode is populated by either one or two photons its state is represented by @xmath70 or @xmath71 , respectively . in the more abstract formalism of ``",
    "ket '' vectors and operators , these state are described as @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "for the two sources emits single photons , modes @xmath60 and @xmath59 can be found excited in either the vacuum state @xmath69 or the single- and the two - photon states @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , with @xmath74 .",
    "however , because of the geometry of the setup , modes @xmath56 and @xmath49 can be excited only in either the vacuum state @xmath69 or the single - photon state @xmath70 , with @xmath75 .    at generic time",
    "@xmath76 the electromagnetic field populating the four modes of our system can be described by the state vector @xmath77 where the symbol `` @xmath78 '' denotes the direct ( or , kronecker ) product between vectors @xcite and @xmath79 gives the number of photons present in the mode @xmath67 .",
    "this notation is precise but somewhat cumbersome therefore , for the sake of clarity , hereafter we shall omit from our formulae both the symbol `` @xmath78 '' between the state vectors of different modes and the vector symbol `` @xmath80 '' itself whenever @xmath81 .",
    "thus , for example , the state vector representing one photon in mode @xmath60 and one photon in mode @xmath56 will be concisely written as @xmath82 instead of @xmath83 .",
    "now assume that the two sources @xmath51 and @xmath43 had emitted at @xmath6 one photon each in modes @xmath60 and @xmath59 , respectively . using the notation introduced above , we can write the initial two - photon state @xmath84 as @xmath85 when the photons enters beam splitters @xmath52 and @xmath44 they either continue propagating along modes @xmath60 and @xmath59 or are reflected into modes @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is accounted for by the unitary evolution of the state vector @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are unitary operators ( effectively , @xmath89 matrices ) representing the coupling between modes @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .    next , it is not difficult to see that under the action of the @xmath2 beam splitter @xmath3 which couples modes @xmath60 and @xmath59 only , the vector state @xmath94 transforms into @xmath95 where the unitary operator @xmath96 acts upon @xmath97 and @xmath98 according to @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to remark that @xmath102 describes either two photons in mode @xmath60 or two photons in mode @xmath59 because the two state vectors representing both photons transmitted and both photons reflected cancel each other .",
    "this is the well - known bunching , or coalescence , effect predicted by quantum mechanics when two indistinguishable photons enter a @xmath2 beam splitter @xcite .",
    "the seven terms in the expression of @xmath103 are associated to specific and mutually exclusive physical processes , as illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the first two terms of @xmath103 represent two photons directed at either @xmath61 or @xmath58 and , therefore , do not describe the instance considered by penrose , namely _",
    "one _ photon aimed at @xmath61 .",
    "the probability of occurrence of these processes is very small being @xmath104 .",
    "the third and fourth terms occur with high probability @xmath105 since @xmath106 , but only the third term proportional to @xmath107 describes a photon directed at @xmath61 , the case of our primary interest .",
    "the fifth and sixth terms describe processes taking place with _ very _ low probability @xmath108 being both @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "it should be noticed that the fifth term precisely describes the process of `` a photon emitted by the floor and aimed at @xmath61 '' that penrose dubbed as `` absurd '' .",
    "differently from the elementary analysis presented in the introduction , here we can see that quantum mechanics does not forbid such a process but assigns to it a negligible , as opposed to the @xmath8 claimed in the introduction , probability of occurrence .",
    "finally , the seventh term represents no photons aimed at either @xmath61 and @xmath58 , an event that happens with low probability @xmath109 .      in order to complete the quantum mechanical analysis of the retrodiction problem as formulated by penrose , we must eventually consider the measurement process .",
    "measurement theory plays a key role in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and , after about a century from the foundation of the last , is still a subject of fierce discussions amongst researchers .",
    "however , for the goal of the present work we will not need to join such debate and we simply address the interested reader to chapters 22 and 29 of @xcite for a popular introduction to the matter , and to chapter 12 of @xcite and @xcite for a more technical exposition .    throughout this work",
    "we adopt the amended version of the celebrated von neumann measurement theory @xcite proposed by moldauer @xcite and further elaborated by peres @xcite . to make a long story short , according to this theory the measuring apparatus itself is considered as a quantum system and is characterized by a certain observable property represented by a given hermitean operator .",
    "let @xmath110 , be the eigenstates of such operator characterizing the detector @xmath111 .",
    "initially , each detector @xmath111 is prepared in the ground state @xmath112 and each field mode @xmath67 is assumed to be in the state @xmath113 , representing @xmath114 photons in the mode @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , considering the photons and the detectors as a single composite quantum system , the initial state vector of the last is given by the expression of @xmath103 with each vector @xmath113 replaced by @xmath115 .",
    "the interaction of the detector with the photons is such that the detector remains in the state @xmath112 if @xmath68 ( no photons counted ) and ends up in the state @xmath116 if @xmath117 ( @xmath114 photons counted ) . for our purposes",
    "we do not need to elaborate further on this point , however , what is crucial for our reasoning is that it is possible to show that such measuring process can be represented by a _ unitary operator _ and is , therefore , perfectly reversible @xcite .",
    "thus , finally , we are ready for answering the question posed in the introduction :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given that a photon has been detected by @xmath1 at some time @xmath6 , what is the probability of an early emission event by @xmath0 at a sufficiently former time @xmath118 ?",

    "specifically , here we consider the two cases where _ a _ ) we can read the counter of detector @xmath61 only ; and _ b _ ) we have access to the counters of all detectors @xmath119 and @xmath50 . in the first case",
    "_ a _ ) , the experimenter has at his disposal the minimal amount of information about the system .",
    "vice versa , in the second case _ b _ ) the available information is maximal .",
    "of course , one could also consider a third , intermediate case _",
    "c _ ) where the accessible information is comprises between the minimal and the maximal .",
    "one explicit example will be given in the next subsection [ background ] .",
    "at this point it is useful to recall that by definition @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "* detector @xmath61 can count @xmath122 or @xmath59 photons per time . according to our previous analysis",
    "illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] , there are four alternative histories , , and for @xmath123 photons detected at @xmath61 .",
    "this process is dominated by photon history occurring when the photon emitted by the source @xmath51 is reflected towards the ceiling by the @xmath2 beam splitter @xmath3 .",
    "the probability for this event is @xmath124 .",
    "the probabilities for the remaining three histories , and are @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , all negligible",
    ". then , there are two alternative histories and for the detection of a single photon at @xmath61 .",
    "there is a probability @xmath124 for the photon history and a negligible probability @xmath126 for the photon history .",
    "finally , there is a small probability @xmath125 for the photon history yielding to @xmath59 photons detected at @xmath61 . given our limited amount of information , this is all what we can say about our observations ,",
    "namely we can only make a _",
    "probabilistic _ retrodiction",
    ". such probabilistic character of quantum retrodiction was already remarked long time ago by einstein , tolman and podolsky who wrote that `` [ ... ] the principles of quantum mechanics actually involve an uncertainty in the description of past events which is analogous to the uncertainty in the prediction of future events.''(p .",
    "780 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , and this is the main result of this work , contrary to penrose s claim quantum mechanics _ does _ give , correctly , different probabilities for the two alternatives ( photon emitted by the source ) and ( photon emitted by the floor ) .",
    "thus , if we register a single detection event at @xmath61 , we can retrodict that the detected photon was emitted by either the source @xmath0 with probability @xmath128=1/ ( 1 + \\epsilon ) \\approx 1 - \\epsilon$ ] , or by the floor @xmath11 with ( insignificant ) probability @xmath129=\\epsilon / ( 1 + \\epsilon ) \\approx   \\epsilon $ ] , where we have defined @xmath130 . *",
    "the seven events illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] are clearly mutually exclusive .",
    "this means that given a specific sequence @xmath131 of counts delivered by @xmath132 and @xmath50 , respectively , we can _ deterministically _ retrodict the photon history . for example , if the detectors deliver the string of counts @xmath133 , this uniquely selects photon history .    from the analyses presented above for both cases of _ a _ ) probabilistic and _ b _ ) deterministic quantum retrodiction , we can thus confirm that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there is no penrose s retrodiction paradox in orthodox quantum mechanics .",

    "given the state vector @xmath103 we may define a _ density operator _ @xmath134 as @xmath135 , \\ ] ] where the generic linear operator @xmath136 $ ] , called _ dyad _ , is a projector upon the state @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the density operator contains as much information about the system as the original state @xmath103 .",
    "however , in case _ a _ ) above we deliberately chose to ignore that part of the available information coming from the counts provided by detectors @xmath137 and @xmath50 .",
    "quantum mechanics deals with this loss of information by introducing the so - called _ reduced density matrix _ @xmath138 describing photons in mode @xmath60 solely , obtained from @xmath134 by tracing with respect to the unobserved modes @xmath139 and @xmath49 @xcite : @xmath140\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\ ; \\sum_{n=0}^2 p_n \\ , \\bigl[\\psi_1^n { \\psi_1^n}^\\dagger \\bigr ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the probabilities that detector @xmath61 had counted @xmath122 and @xmath59 photons , respectively .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath143",
    "@xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 . from the beam splitters properties @xmath120 and @xmath121 , it follows that @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , we can write the reduced density matrix @xmath138 as : @xmath149 + \\frac{1 } { 2}\\bigl[\\psi_1 { \\psi_1}^\\dagger \\bigr ] , \\ ] ] which expresses the fact that detector @xmath61 counts either zero or one photon with @xmath8 probability .    with this formalism at our disposal , we are now ready to consider the third case _ c _ ) mentioned in the previous subsection [ detection ] , occurring when we possess a partial information about the system .",
    "specifically , we consider the case when _ we know _ that there is either one photon in mode @xmath60 after the beam splitter @xmath52 , or one photon in mode @xmath59 after the beam splitter @xmath44 .",
    "we acquire this information when either detector @xmath50 or detector @xmath57 , respectively , had recorded one photon .",
    "then , according to figure [ fig4 ] , either histories or histories , may occur . having this additional information at our disposal",
    ", we must update the description of the system by replacing the _ pure _ vector state @xmath94 given in equation ( [ psi1 ] ) , with a suitably defined density operator describing the two mutually exclusive instances of having one photon either in mode @xmath60 or in mode @xmath59 .",
    "when detector @xmath50 clicks and @xmath57 does not , the system is described by the state vector @xmath94 projected upon @xmath150 , which represents the occurrence of zero photons in mode @xmath56 and one photon in mode @xmath49 .",
    "analogously , when detector @xmath57 clicks and @xmath50 does not , we must project @xmath94 on @xmath151 . therefore ,",
    "after that one photon has been detected by either @xmath50 or @xmath57 , our system will be represented by either the vector state @xmath152 with high probability @xmath153 , or by @xmath154 with low probability @xmath155 . in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics ,",
    "these two instances can be properly represented by the normalized density operator @xmath156 + w_2 \\bigl[\\psi_2 \\psi_2^\\dagger \\bigr ] ,   \\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath130 . in practice , the operator @xmath159 tells us that when only one photon is present in our system , then it has been either emitted by the source @xmath0 with probability @xmath160 , or by the floor @xmath11 with probability @xmath161 .",
    "it is important to remark that passing from the _ complete _ description furnished by @xmath94 , to the _ incomplete _ one given by @xmath159 , we could actually reduce our two - photon version of penrose s paradox to the one - photon version originally considered by penrose , which then manifests as a particular case of a more general problem .",
    "however , also for this case our treatment shows that quantum mechanics furnishes the correct values for the retrodiction probabilities .",
    "this calculation concludes our quantum - mechanical analysis of the retrodiction paradox as presented by penrose .",

    "a thorough analysis of this problem eventually led us to the conclusion that there is no retrodiction paradox in optics , at least not in the form suggested by penrose .",
    "in fact , we demonstrated that the deceptive inconsistencies arising in the quantum and classical descriptions of light when making retrodictions , are simply due to an incomplete knowledge of the state of the light .",
    "why incomplete ?",
    "because light , either classical or quantum , in many instances does not behave as just being `` here _ or _ there '' , but rather as being `` here _ and _ there '' .",
    "this non - locality is peculiar of all wave phenomena , irrespective of their classical or quantum nature .",
    "therefore , when we measure some observable property of light only `` here '' ( as it is the case of penrose s paradox ) , we are missing all that part of information carried by the light `` there '' .",
    "a typical example thereof is precisely given by the light entering beam - splitter in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "when leaving the beam splitter , the light is both transmitted towards the detector @xmath1 _ and _ reflected in the direction of the ceiling @xmath5 , and this is true even at single - photon level . in summary ,",
    "whenever we possess sufficient information about our system , the use of either classical or quantum descriptions of light always leads to correct retrodictions in the scheme proposed by penrose .    in conclusion , paraphrasing a famous danish proverb often quoted by niels bohr , we would like to state that _ retrodiction is not very difficult , especially about the past_.",
