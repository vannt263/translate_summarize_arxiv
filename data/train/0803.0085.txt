    "physical properties and their variation with external stimuli or internal disorder in half doped perovskite manganites with generic formula @xmath3 ( where r and a respectively stand for trivalent rare earth and divalent alkaline earth elements ) are topics of significant current interest @xcite .",
    "coexistence of contrasting phases , namely , ferromagnetic ( fm ) - metallic ( m ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) - insulating ( i ) is a common occurrence in manganites around half doping @xcite . this phase coexistence or phase separation ( ps )",
    "is considered to be responsible factor for observed functional properties as well as argued to be main impetus for _ bi - critical _ phase competition @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of ps and the nature of coexisting phases remain a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "it is widely considered that fm - m and af - i phases have similar energies in manganites around half - doping as a result of which small perturbations , compared to thermal energy , can cause colossal changes @xcite .",
    "this proximity in energies of two contrasting phases remains despite considerable change in the nature of spin , charge and orbital ordering of the ground state with the variation in ionic radii of r / a atoms , which affects the mn - o - mn bonds and the one electron bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the decrease in average radii of r / a atoms brings about decrease in bandwidth and the ground state of the system changes from so called a - type to ce - type af structure .",
    "this indicates that the nature of ps and the effect of quenched disorder may not remain identical as spin , charge and orbital ordering changes across the bandwidth .",
    "it has been shown that ` finite - size ' clusters with large uncompensated spins are created when quenched disorder is introduced in the mn - site of narrow bandwidth @xmath4 having ce - type af and charge ordered - insulating ground state @xcite .",
    "electronic phase separation gives rise to interesting effects within these clusters having some similarities with other transition metal oxides like cuprates and nickelates @xcite .",
    "quenched disorder in the form of magnetic ions ( a few % of cr and co ) in @xmath5 and @xmath4 respectively , gives rise to coexisting af - i and fm - m phases with many unusual physical properties at low temperature @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent studies have shown that the ground state of @xmath4 changes to fm - m even with minimal substitution of non - magnetic disorder ( 2.5% al ) at mn - site , without introducing any significant structural distortion @xcite .",
    "significantly , the conductivity of @xmath4 increases when such disorder is introduced in the mn - o - mn network @xcite . apart from chemical substitution , internal disorder in various forms also lead to remarkable effects .",
    "for example , anisotropic stress in @xmath6 , having larger bandwidth than @xmath4 , has significantly changed the orbital ordering ( oo ) and other physical properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 , which is an intermediate bandwidth system with a - type af - i ground state , shows strain induced dimensionality crossover triggering a localization - delocalization transition @xcite . in the classic work of imry and ma @xcite , it was argued that random quenched disorder arising from lattice defects , dislocations or chemical substitution can destabilize the long range order system favoring formation of ` finite - size ' clusters .",
    "appearance of coexisting clusters and their size regulation by disorder in manganites is also shown from simulation work by moreo _",
    "_ @xcite . in another study ,",
    "et al . _ proposed chemical disorder driven inhomogeneous states across the first order transition @xcite .",
    "recently , the fragility of both a - type and ce - type af - i ground state against quenched disorder is shown from computer simulation @xcite . following these experimental and theoretical developments , it becomes imperative to investigate seriously the nature of ps and the effect of disorder in different half doped manganites .    in this context ,",
    "@xmath0 ( psmo ) is very attracting system considering the a - type af ground state where fm layers are coupled antiferromagnetically exhibiting quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) metallic behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover , this composition is at the phase boundary of fm and af ground states @xcite thus , making it quite vulnerable towards tendency for ps , which has been observed at low temperature from the @xmath7 nmr study @xcite .",
    "further , psmo has a second order paramagnetic ( pm)-i to fm - m transition around 270 k and a first order fm - m to af - i transition around 140 k @xcite .",
    "imry and wortis @xcite had predicted the rounding of first order transition due to quenched random disorder and beyond certain percentage the nature of transition is expected to change from first to second order .",
    "recently , it is shown that the transformation kinetics of the first order transition in psmo is hindered , resulting in tunable coexisting fraction of kinetically arrested high - t ( fm ) phase with equilibrium af - i phase at low temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , substitution of quenched disorder in this system will reveal the effect on both the phase transitions as well as on the nature of ps in the same system .",
    "however , introducing quenched disorder in manganite in the form of chemical substitutions remains a challenging task , as introduction of dissimilar ion(s ) at r / a or mn - site can lead to change in structure , which modifies the original system completely . apart from this ,",
    "introduction of magnetic elements will also modify the basic system by introducing additional magnetic interactions .",
    "we report here a detail study of ps in psmo and the effect of substitutional disorder ( ga ) at the mn - site .",
    "substitution of ga neither add any magnetic interaction nor introduce any significant lattice distortion since @xmath8 being @xmath9 element has zero orbital or spin moment and has matching ionic radii with the existing @xmath10 @xcite . earlier study on the same substitution in psmo has mainly focused on magneto - transport properties and shown that high - t fm phase is suppressed and low - t af phase is enhanced due to the quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "thus disorder promotes the af interactions at the cost of fm in psmo , which is contrary to the observation in @xmath4 for the similar kind of substitution @xcite .",
    "the significant findings of present study are summarized below .",
    "we show drastic decrease in fm transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) and increase in af transition ( @xmath2 ) with ga substitution ( upto 7.5% ) without any significant change in structure .",
    "the change in @xmath1 with ga follows simple mean - field variation indicating that there is no unwanted magnetic interaction is added to the system by the quenched disorder ( sec .",
    "the coexisting fm and non - fm clusters arise at high temperature just below @xmath1 and persists much below @xmath2 for all the samples .",
    "size of the fm clusters reduces with the increase in quenched disorder ( sec .",
    "the fm phase fraction changes continuously as the temperature is reduced from @xmath1 and is tracked using second - order susceptibility which directly probes the variation in the spontaneous magnetization ( sec .",
    "an attempt is made to identify the nature of the coexisting non - fm phase in the fm regime and is found to be af in nature .",
    "_ this significant observation implies that both the fm and af phases form at @xmath1 _ ( sec .",
    "it is interesting to note that though the measured magnetic moment at 2k matches well with the fully spin aligned value , the moment found from the fitting to curie - weiss law above @xmath1 gives much higher value indicating the existence of fm short - range order above @xmath1 ( sec .",
    "the intriguing nature of the coexisting phases in psmo is substantiated through resistivity measurements which also shows drastic effect of the quenched disorder ( sec .",

    "o1 refers to the apical oxygen of the perovskites and o2 is the equatorial oxygen which lies in the plane of the perovskite layer .",
    "the average mn valence state of mn was determined by iodometric titration .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      resistivity measurement also substantiates the remarkable phase coexistence shown from the magnetic measurements .",
    "9a shows resistivity for x = 0 compound measured while heating and cooling . a metal to insulator transition ( mit ) has been observed around 270 k in agreement with the single crystal measurement @xcite . as the fm - af transition is approached while cooling , resistivity shows steep increase accompanied by a huge thermal hysteresis , which is characteristics of first order phase transition .",
    "minor hysteresis loops ( mhls ) are shown to be a useful method to confirm as well as study the disorder broadened first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "following similar protocol we have recorded mhls by measuring resistivity while cooling , to different temperatures ( 113 , 104 , 95 and 90 k ) and then heating from those points to all the way above @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "9b ) . mhls are also recorded in heating cycle ( not shown ) confirming disorder broadened first order transition and related variation of coexisting metallic and insulating phase fractions .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that th in resistivity remains much above @xmath2 ( it remains distinct up to 225 k well within fm region ) as shown in the inset of fig . 9a .",
    "_ it is rather significant that resistivity being a percolative process , such th well within the fm region confirms that fraction of fm ( metallic ) clusters changes right from their formation at higher temperature as also concluded from the magnetic measurements .",
    "10 shows resistivity for all the samples .",
    "no clear mit was observed in the ga substituted samples and resistivity increases with the substitution at all temperatures .",
    "however , the signature of fm to af transition is clear from the kink in resistivity appearing around the @xmath2 of the respective samples with an exception for x = 0.075 . the effect of quenched disorder is drastic and shows an increase by about 0.5 @xmath16 times in resistivity at 92 k , well within af phase , with only 7.5% substitutional disorder .",
    "though increase in resistivity with quenched disorder is observed in another half doped bilayer manganite @xcite but the observed colossal increase in the present series is rather intriguing since here also the resistivity is governed by the electrical conduction in the fm layers of the a - type af structure .",
    "it may be mentioned here , that in an earlier study decrease in resistivity has been observed with disorder for the ce type af state @xcite . in view of these and also in the context of recent theoretical developments",
    "@xcite , detailed investigation of the resistivity behaviour of the present series needs to be undertaken .",
    "in summary , we have studied the structural , magnetic and transport properties of half doped @xmath0 and the effect of quenched disorder ( ga substitution ) in the magnetic lattice without introducing any additional magnetic interactions or significant structural distortion .",
    "substitution of ga in the mn - site has drastic but opposite effects on the fm and af transitions .",
    "increase in substitutional disorder decreases @xmath1 but increases @xmath2 and points toward reduction in the strength of double - exchange interaction in this intermediate bandwidth system .",
    "the fm state is found to be inhomogeneous and the fm cluster size decreases with decrease in temperature or increase in quenched disorder .",
    "the electronic phase separation gives rise to thermal hysteresis in the size of this clusters right from their formation at @xmath1 which is evident from the th in the susceptibility or spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this system shows a novel phase coexistence , _ both fm and af clusters form with the onset of long - range order in the system at @xmath1 and persist down to the lowest temperature .",
    "_ moreover , the short range fm interaction exists much above @xmath1 .",
    "resistivity also shows the signature of the variation of coexisting phases and substantiates the conclusion drawn from the magnetic measurements . at lower temperature ( in af state )",
    ", resistivity shows orders of magnitude increase with quenched disorder .",
    "the observed novel phase coexistence needs further attention and required to be probed through microscopic tools and supporting theoretical work .",
