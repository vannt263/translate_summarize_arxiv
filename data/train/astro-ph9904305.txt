    "high mass binary pulsars are binaries in which a radio pulsar is accompanied by an unseen companion that is approximately as massive as the pulsar . although the companion is generally believed to be another neutron star , it appears to be likely that some of the high - mass binary pulsars are not accompanied by neutron stars but are instead accompanied by white dwarfs or low - mass main - sequence stars .",
    "psr b1820 - 11 ( j1823 - 1115 ) , for example , is a radio pulsar in a binary with an orbital period @xmath3  days and an eccentricity @xmath4  ( lyne & mckenna 1989 ) . the derived mass function @xmath5 indicates that the mass of the companion exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "the small spin - down age of the pulsar ( @xmath7myr ) and its strong magnetic field ( @xmath8 ) suggest that it is a young  non - recycled  pulsar ( phinney & verbunt 1991 ) .",
    "based on the mass function and the orbital eccentricity , lyne & mckenna ( 1989 ) suggest that the most likely companion to  is a neutron star .",
    "the companion is unlikely to be a massive hydrogen star or a black hole due to the low mass function .",
    "lyne & mckenna argue that the observed orbital eccentricity excludes the companion as a white dwarf or a low - mass helium star .",
    "phinney & verbunt ( 1991 ) suggest that the companion of  may be a @xmath9main - sequence star , which will make the system a precursor of low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "also psr b2303 + 46 may contain a non - recycled pulsar ( @xmath10s , @xmath11myr , @xmath12 g ) in a binary with @xmath13day and @xmath14 ( stokes et al .",
    "the total mass of the binary is @xmath15(thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) and no optical counterpart was detected down to @xmath16 ( kulkarni 1988 ) .",
    "recently van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 1999 ) , however , discovered an object which coincides with the timing position of  and the properties of this object are consistent with those of a massive white dwarf with a cooling age close to the age of pulsar .",
    "with population synthesis calculations we demonstrate that the birth rate of binaries in which the neutron star is born _ after _ the white dwarf is comparable to the birth rate of binaries with two neutron stars . in the former case",
    "the binary will have a high eccentricity eccentric and the radio pulsar will be accompanied by a white dwarf with a mass @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we argue that both  and  systems may be formed via such a scenario ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "the calculations , however , do not rule out that the companion of  is either another neutron star or a main - sequence star . in the latter case , the mass of the main - sequence star would most likely be between @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "at a distance of 6.3kpc and a height above the galactic plane of @xmath18pc ( taylor , manchester , & lyne 1993 ) ,  is heavily obscured by the interstellar medium .",
    "a star with an absolute magnitude of @xmath19 could easily be missed in a survey with a limiting magnitude of @xmath20 ( assuming an interstellar absorption of @xmath21 . in the usno - a v1.0 catalog ( monet  1997 ) , based on the palomar sky survey , the object closest to  is located at a distance of 5.9 seconds of arc and therefore can not be associated with .",
    "there is no indication for other forms of radiation ( x - rays , infrared , etc . ) from the direction of .",
    "these suggest that the companion can not be a very massive star or have a strong stellar wind .",
    "the presence of radio emission indicates that the rate of mass loss by the companion star is modest . an upper limit to  in the stellar wind of the companion",
    "can be estimated from the expression for the optical depth of the stellar wind for free - free absorption ( , eq .  16 in illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) . by assuming that the wind of the accompanying star is transparent at @xmath22 cm ( and a temperature of the stellar plasma of @xmath23k ) we obtain @xmath24 } \\ , { p{\\mbox{$_{\\rm orb}$}}\\over      [ { \\rm day } ] } \\ ,      ( 1-e)^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\,\\,\\ ; [ { \\mbox { ~${\\rm m_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ } } ] , \\label{eq : ppulsar}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the mass of the binary .",
    "the estimate for depends on the eccentricity ; substitution of @xmath26 for @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppulsar ] ) gives the lower limit for the mass loss rate given that the radio pulsar is only visible at apocenter .",
    "we illustrate this limit in fig . 1 for two typical combinations of @xmath28  and .",
    "a binary with more or less similar orbital characteristics is psr  b1259 - 63 ( @xmath29days , @xmath30 ; johnston 1992 , 1994 ) which contains a radio pulsar and a be - type star .",
    "the pulsar is visible at apastron but not at periastron .",
    "this is understood from eq.([eq : ppulsar ] ) as an effect of shielding of the radio signal from the pulsar by the stellar wind .",
    "another known radio pulsar in a long - period binary is psr j0045 - 7319 ( @xmath31days , @xmath32 ) with a b1 v ( @xmath33 ) companion with @xmath34  ( mcconnell 1991 ; bell 1995 ; kaspi , tauris & manchester 1996 ) .",
    "this pulsar is visible along its entire orbit due to a more tenuous wind of the companion star , which is typical for a lower metallicity star in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the absence of eclipses and of x - rays from accretion or shocks generated by the interaction between the pulsar wind with wind of the be star ( as are observed in psr b1259 - 63 , grove  1995 ) also indicates that the companion of  is not likely to be a massive star . an upper limit to the mass - loss rate of the companion star in  may be set by measuring variations in the dispersion measure of the radio pulsar when it is close to periastron ( see melatos , johnston , & melrose 1995 ) .",
    "the eccentricity of a binary orbit can either be primordial or induced by the sudden mass loss by one of the stars ( blaauw 1961 ) .",
    "the latter is expected to occur in a supernova in which the exploding star loses a considerable fraction of its mass leaving behind a neutron star .",
    "the orbital periods of  and  prohibit the observed eccentricity from being primordial ; these binaries have experienced a phase of mass transfer which circularized the orbit .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of these binaries are therefore induced by a supernova which may have produced the currently observed pulsar .",
    "if the companions to  or psr b2303 + 46 are white dwarfs they must have been formed _ before _ the neutron stars .",
    "this possibility was never studied in detail since the progenitor of a white dwarf is expected to live longer than the progenitor of a neutron star .",
    "however , it was noticed by tutukov & yungelson ( 1993 ) and by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) that a reversal of evolution can be accomplished if both stars are similar in mass and if the masses of both stars are only slightly smaller than the mass limit for forming a neutron star .",
    "if this is the case , the secondary star may still gain enough mass in a phase of mass transfer to pass the limit for forming a neutron star . for this to happen mass transfer",
    "should proceed rather conservatively , which will be the case since the initial mass ratio is close to unity . in the second , unstable , phase of mass transfer the white dwarf ( original primary star ) will spiral - in into the envelope of the secondary as this star ascends the giant branch .",
    "this phase causes the orbital period to decrease dramatically by using orbital energy to carry the common envelope to infinity .",
    "if the white dwarf and the core of the giant stay detached after the common envelope is ejected , a close binary consisting of a white dwarf and a helium star remains .    if the helium star is massive enough , the binary experiences a supernova and a young radio pulsar is formed .",
    "if the system survives the supernova the companion of the radio pulsar will be a white dwarf in an eccentric orbit .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf will be @xmath0 in such a case , because it originated from a star that was rather massive .",
    "we use the population synthesis program for binary stars seba ( portegies zwart & verbunt 1996 ) for evolving a million binaries with a primary mass between 8  and 100 .",
    "we used model b from portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ; henceforth pzy98 ) , which satisfactorily reproduces the properties of observed high - mass binary pulsars ( with neutron star companions ) .",
    "for a single star we adopt a minimum zero - age mass of 8  for forming a neutron stars , which coincides with estimates based on observations ( koester & reimers 1996 , see however ritossa , garcia - berro , & iben ( 1996 ) who show that a single star with a mass of 10  may still evolve into a oxygen - neon - magnesium white dwarf ) .",
    "if a star is stripped of its envelope in an early phase this lower limit may become as large as 12 .",
    "coincidence of the lower limits of the initial primary mass for our simulation with the minimum mass for the progenitors of neutron stars results in an underestimate in the formation of binaries in which the secondary star experiences a supernova . by comparing our results with those of portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ,",
    "see their tab .  4 ) , who take lower mass primaries into account",
    ", we evaluate that this affects our results with @xmath35% .    while referring the reader to pzy98 for details , we list here the most crucial assumptions .",
    "the masses of the primaries obey a power - law with exponent 2.5 ( salpeter @xmath36 ) .",
    "the initial mass function is normalized to the current galactic star - formation rate of 4  ( van den hoek & de jong 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that all stars are born in binaries with a semi - major axis up to @xmath37  .",
    "the distribution was chosen to be flat in @xmath38 .",
    "roche - lobe contact at zero age sets the minimum to the distribution of initial separations .",
    "the mass of the secondary is selected to be between 0.1  and the mass of the primary from a flat mass ratio distribution .",
    "the eccentricity for each binary is taken from the thermal distribution between zero and unity .",
    "neutron stars receive a kick upon birth .",
    "the velocity of the kick is taken randomly from the distribution function proposed by hartman ( 1997 ) and in a random direction .",
    "black holes ( from stars initially more massive than 40 ) receive a kick velocity which is scaled by @xmath39 .    from computations presented in",
    "pzy98 one may infer that our conclusions concerning birth rates and  distributions for various combinations of neutron star and companion are robust with respect to reasonable variations in the most crucial model parameters and initial conditions , such as the kick velocity distribution and common envelope parameter , initial mass function and initial distribution in orbital periods .",
    "the criteria for the stability of mass transfer and the adopted rate of mass lost via a stellar wind and the amount of momentum lost per unit mass , however , may affect the details of our calculations rather significantly .",
    "from the output of the computer simulations we select binaries with at least one neutron star . within these constraints",
    "three orbital - period ranges are considered : @xmath40days .",
    "table  [ tab : table ] gives the model birth rates for the binaries in various groups depending on the nature and the mass of the companion of the neutron star .",
    "figures 1 and 2 give the probability distributions for these binaries in the orbital period - eccentricity plane .",
    "the birth rates in table  [ tab : table ] reflect the initial distributions of the binary parameters and the complicated evolutionary history via several phases of mass transfer and at least one supernova .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the most common companion to a pulsar is a rather massive ( @xmath41)main - sequence star in a relatively wide binary ( @xmath42days , fig .",
    "as argued above , the presence of such a massive companion in  may be excluded by the absence of an optical counterpart and the unlikely inclination of the orbit ; hiding a companion of @xmath43  demands @xmath44  ( lyne & mckenna 1989 ) .",
    "the observed radio emission also makes it unlikely that the mass of the companion to  is @xmath41 .",
    "such a companion star with a mass loss in the stellar wind of @xmath45 ( which is chosen on the high side to account for the enhanced wind mass loss for be stars ) would easily shield the radiation of the radio pulsar along its entire orbit ( see fig.[fig : pe1820 ] ) .    in the range of orbital periods @xmath46 , days the birth rates of neutron stars accompanied either by another neutron star ( ) , a white dwarf ( ) , a low mass @xmath47   main - sequence star ( _ ms _ ) or a black hole ( ) are comparable ( table [ tab : table ] ) . the relatively large population of ( , ) systems and their distribution in orbital periods is a result of the evolutionary history of massive stars which is dominated by stellar wind mass loss rather than roche lobe overflow and by the lower kick velocities imparted to black holes .",
    "however , the mass function of  makes a black hole with mass exceeding several  as a companion unlikely , and for  such a massive companion is excluded by the measured total mass .    .",
    "results of the model computations for binaries with at least one radio pulsar .",
    "the first column identifies the various binary components .",
    "cols .  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the mass limits for the companion of the pulsar ( black holes have a mass @xmath48 ) . col .",
    "( 4 ) gives the total galactic birth rate ( br ) of such binaries .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) give the birth rate of binaries with an orbital period larger than 10 , 100 , and 1000 days , respectively , in the units of @xmath49 [ cols=\"<,>,<,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     [ tab : table ]    figure  [ figallpe ] compares the probability distributions for binaries with a radio pulsar which is accompanied by a white dwarf ( upper panel ) and an older neutron star ( lower panel ) in the orbital period - eccentricity diagram .",
    "our model calculations reveal that the binaries in which a young pulsar is accompanied by a massive white dwarf are generally rather eccentric ( @xmath50 ) and that their orbital periods are distributed with more or less equal probability in @xmath51 between a few hours and about one hundred days . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe1820 ]  appears at the edge of the area with highest probability , while the orbital parameters of  fall nicely in the densely populated area of the  diagram .",
    "this suggests , together with the rather high birth rate of such binaries , that  may well contain a white dwarf as a companion star .",
    "recently van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 1999 ) found evidence that  is accompanied by a white dwarf with a mass of about 1.2 .",
    "fits rather ill in either of the  diagrams for ( , ) , ( , ) , and low mass or moderate mass ( , ) binaries . the relative birthrates for a population of binaries with long orbital periods increases by increasing the efficiency of the deposition of orbital energy into common envelopes during the spiral - in phase ( see pzy98 ) .",
    "however , this would require us to relax the decisive criterion why we chose this specific set of model parameters ; the coincidence of having the other high mass binary pulsars ( psr j1518 + 49 , b1534 + 12 , and b1913 + 16 ) in the most densely populated areas in the  diagram for ( , ) binaries .",
    "there is no evidence for a strong selection against the discovery of a young pulsar which is accompanied by a dead pulsar or by a massive white dwarf with an orbital period @xmath52days ( johnston & kulkarni 1991 )",
    ". the higher birth rate of binaries in which the radio pulsar is accompanied by a low mass main - sequence star and the better coincidence in the  diagram makes this possibility very attractive .",
    "if the companion of  is indeed a low or moderate mass main - sequence star it may be a precursor of a system similar to gx  1 + 4 = v2116 oph , which shows the x - ray features of an accreting neutron star and which is identified with a symbiotic star ( davidsen , malina , & bowyer 1977 ) .",
    "the orbital period of gx  1 + 4 is @xmath53 days ( chakrabarty & roche 1997 ) . the low birth rate of such binaries ( table [ tab : table ] ) together with the short life time of a red giant explains the paucity of such x - ray binaries .",
    "we have studied the nature of the companions of young radio pulsars in eccentric orbits .",
    "our calculations reveal that the possibility that a young pulsar is accompanied by a white dwarf of mass @xmath54 can not be neglected .",
    "the birth rate of such binaries is higher than the birth rate of of binaries in which a young pulsar is accompanied by a dead pulsar ( i.e. : an old neutron star ) .",
    "we argue therefore that  may be accompanied by a massive white dwarf , however the probability that its companion is a main - sequence star with a mass @xmath55 ( or even another neutron star ) is similar to the probability of being a white dwarf .",
    "our calculations confirm the observation of van kerkwijk & kulkarni ( 1999 ) in the sense that it is likely that  is accompanied by a white dwarf with a mass @xmath56 .",
