    "clearly @xmath1210 , and @xmath1211 .",
    "we see that , restricted to the generators @xmath1183 , @xmath1184 , and @xmath1207 , we have a  chain complex of the graph on figure  [ fig : gr1 ] .",
    "the kernel is generated by the elementary squares , so it is enough so see that each square is a coboundary . indeed , the elementary square with the lower left corner @xmath1212 is a  coboundary of the generator with gaps @xmath1213 .",
    "finally , assume @xmath1214 or @xmath1215 .",
    "these are the tight cases , in the sense that the lengths of all gaps are predetermined : the top gap consists of just @xmath907 , and the other 2 , resp .  3 , gaps are of length  2 .",
    "assume that the kernel of @xmath674 is not zero , and let @xmath160 be an  element in @xmath1216 .",
    "let @xmath1217 be a  generator , which is contained in @xmath160 with a  nonzero coefficient , such that this @xmath1217 maximizes the height of the top gap over all generators appearing with a  nonzero coefficient in  @xmath160 .",
    "removing the lower element of the top gap of @xmath1217 gives a  generator which can not be cancelled out by the coboundaries of other elements in @xmath160 , due to the assumed maximality property .",
    "this yields a  contradiction , and hence @xmath1218 .",
    "we move on to group ( gr4 ) , and let @xmath1148 correspond to a  generator indexed by @xmath1180 , and @xmath311 side arcs .",
    "we can have at most @xmath1219 gaps .",
    "the dimension of the contributing cohomology generator is at least @xmath1220 , thus total length of the gaps is at least @xmath1175 . comparing these inequalities we get @xmath1178 with the only exception @xmath1221 .",
    "let @xmath1177 .",

    "hence , we conclude that the contribution to @xmath1227 is  0 .",
    "finally , we consider the case of generators indexed with collections of arcs avoiding all @xmath1145- and @xmath1144-arcs .",
    "let us assume there are @xmath311 such arcs . to avoid a  cochain complex of a  simplex",

    "on the other hand , since the dimension of the generator is at least @xmath1194 , the total length of the gaps must be at least @xmath1195 . comparing we see that @xmath1196 with the exceptions @xmath1197 , any @xmath12 , @xmath582 , @xmath1228 , and @xmath1229 , @xmath583 .    if @xmath1197 , the only nontrivial case occurs in the row @xmath12 . then , in the entry of interest we have only one generator : the one indexed by the arcs @xmath1230 .",
    "its coboundary will contain the generator @xmath1231 , hence it is different from  0 .",
    "let @xmath580 .",
    "since we are in the row 6 , for dimensional reasons , the total length of gaps in the contributing generator is  4 .",
    "thus , we have two types of generators : @xmath1232 indexed with arc collections @xmath1233 , @xmath1234 , and @xmath1235 indexed with arc collections @xmath1236 , @xmath1224 .",
    "considering the value of @xmath674 on the generator indexed with @xmath1237 , we see that for @xmath1238 , modulo coboundaries , any generator @xmath1232 is a  linear combination of the generators @xmath1239 .",
    "the coboundary of @xmath1240 contains the generator indexed with @xmath1241 , hence no element in the kernel of @xmath674 can contain @xmath1240 with a  nonzero coefficient .",
    "finally , a  nonzero linear combination of @xmath1239 s can not lie in the kernel of @xmath674 , since @xmath1242 contains the generator indexed with @xmath1243 , which is different for different  @xmath865 .",
    "again , we conclude that the contribution to @xmath1227 is  0 .",
    "let @xmath1199 .",
    "for dimensional reasons , the total length of the gaps is precisely  7 , thus we have the generators @xmath1183 indexed with arc collections @xmath1244 , for @xmath1245 , @xmath1246 . since @xmath1187 contains the generator indexed with @xmath1247 , and these generators are different for different @xmath1183 s , we see that @xmath674 is injective on the space spanned by @xmath1183 s",
    ". therefore , in this case the contribution to @xmath1227 is  0 .",
    "the case @xmath1214 is completely analogous .",
