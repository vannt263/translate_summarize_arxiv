    "the nearest molecular cloud complex to the sun ( distance @xmath0 65  pc ) consists of clouds 11 , 12 , and 13 from the catalog of magnani et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and is located at ( l , b ) @xmath0 ( 159.4,@xmath534.3 ) .",
    "this complex of clouds ( which we will refer to as mbm12 ) was first identified by lynds ( 1962 ) and appears as objects l1453-l1454 , l1457 , l1458 in her catalog of dark nebulae .",
    "the mass of the entire complex is estimated to be @xmath0  30200  m@xmath6 based on radio maps of the region in @xmath7co , @xmath8co and c@xmath9o ( pound et al .",
    "1990 ; zimmermann & ungerechts 1990 ) .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in understanding the origin of many isolated t  tauri stars ( tts ) and isolated regions of star - formation .",
    "for example , within @xmath0  100  pc from the sun there are at least two additional regions of recent star - formation : the tw  hydrae association ( distance @xmath0  50  pc ; e.g , kastner et al .",
    "1997 ; webb et al . 1999 ) and the @xmath10 chamaeleontis region ( distance @xmath0  97  pc ; mamajek et al .",
    "both of these star - forming regions appear to be isolated in that they do not appear to be associated with any molecular gas .",
    "in addition , both are comprised mainly of `` weak - line '' tts equivalent widths , w(h@xmath11 ) @xmath4 @xmath510  and `` classical '' tts ( ctts ) to be tts with w(h@xmath11 ) @xmath12 @xmath510 where the negative sign denotes emission ] .",
    "in contrast , most of the tts in mbm12 are ctts which are still associated with their parent molecular cloud .",
    "in addition to the above isolated star - forming regions , tts have been found outside of the central cloud core regions in many nearby star - forming cloud complexes ( see references in feigelson 1996 ) .",
    "several theories exist to explain how tts can separate from their parent molecular clouds either by dynamical interactions ( sterzik & durisen 1995 ) or by high - velocity cloud impacts ( @xcite ) .",
    "feigelson ( 1996 ) also suggests that some of these tts may form in small turbulent cloudlets that dissipate after forming a few tts .",
    "since the tts in mbm12 appear to still be in the cloud in which they formed , we know they have not been ejected from some other more distant star - forming region .",
    "therefore mbm12 may be an example of one of the cloudlets proposed by feigelson ( 1996 ) .",
    "moriarity - schieven et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that mbm12 has recently been compressed by a shock associated with its interface with the local bubble .",
    "this shock may also have recently triggered the star - formation currently observed in mbm12 ( cf .",
    "elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "alternatively ballesteros - paredes et al . ( 1999 ) suggest that mbm12 may be an example of a star - forming molecular cloud that formed via large scale streams in the interstellar medium .",
    "mbm12 is different from most other high - latitude clouds at @xmath13 @xmath4 30@xmath14 in terms of its higher extinction and its star formation capability ( e.g. , hearty et al .",
    "based on co observations and star counts , the peak extinction in the cloud is @xmath3  @xmath0  5  mag ( duerr & craine 1982a ; magnani et al .   1985 ; pound et al .",
    "1990 ; zimmermann & ungerechts 1990 ) . however , molecular clouds are clumpy and it is possible that some small dense cores with @xmath3  @xmath4  5  mag were not resolved in previous molecular line and extinction surveys .",
    "for example , zuckerman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) estimate @xmath3  @xmath0  11.5  mag through the cloud , along the line of sight to the eclipsing cataclysmic variable h0253 + 193 located behind the cloud and we estimate @xmath3  @xmath0  8.48.9 along the line of sight to a g9 star located on the far side of the cloud ( sect .",
    "[ cafos ] )    although there is evidence for gravitationally bound cores in mbm12 , the entire cloud does not seem to be bound by gravity or pressure ( pound et al .",
    "1990 ; zimmermann & ungerechts 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , the cloud is likely a short - lived , transient , object similar to other high latitude clouds which have estimated lifetimes of a few million years based on the sound crossing time of the clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , mbm12 will dissipate in a few million years and leave behind an association similar to the tw  hydrae association that does not appear to be associated with any molecular material .",
    "previous searches for tts in mbm12 have made use of h@xmath11 , infrared , and x - ray observations .",
    "the previously known tts in mbm12 are listed in table  [ previous ] with their coordinates , spectral types , apparent magnitudes , and selected references .",
    "we include the star s18 in the list even though downes & keyes ( 1988 ) point out that it could be an me star rather than a t  tauri star since our observations confirm that it is a ctts .",
    "the previously known and new tts stars identified in this study are plotted in fig .  [ iras ] with an iras 100  @xmath15 m contour that shows the extent of the cloud .",
    ".previously known t  tauri stars in mbm12 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath16 herbig ( 1977 ) measured a radial velocity of @xmath17 km  s@xmath18 for this object .",
    "we obtained high resolution spectra of two of the t  tauri stars in mbm12 with foces at the calar alto 2.2-m telescope in august 1998 .",
    "the spectra for these stars ( rxj0255.4 + 2005 and lkh@xmath11264 , see fig .  3 . ) allow us to estimate their radial velocities and confirm the w(li ) measurements of our low resolution spectra presented in sect .",
    "[ cafos ] .",
    "determinations of radial velocity , rv , and projected rotational velocity , vsin@xmath19 , have been obtained by means of cross correlation analysis of the stellar spectra with those of radial velocity and rotational standard stars , treated in analogous way . given the large spectral range covered by the foces spectra , the cross correlation of the target and template stars was performed after rebinning the spectra to a logarithmic wavelength scale , in order to eliminate the dependence of doppler shift on the wavelength . moreover , only parts of the spectra free of emission lines and/or not affected by telluric absorption lines have been used .",
    "therefore , the nai d , and h@xmath11 lines as well as wavelengths longer than about 7000   have been excluded from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the result of the cross - correlation is a correlation peak which can be fitted with a gaussian curve .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian , center position and full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) are directly related to rv and vsin@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the method of the correlation has been fully described by queloz ( 1994 ) , and soderblom et al .",
    "more details about the calibration procedure can be found in appendix a of covino et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the radial velocities we measured for the two mbm12 tts listed in table  [ velocity ] are similar to that of the molecular gas ( zimmermann & ungerechts 1990 ; pound et al .",
    "radial velocity measurements have not yet been made for the fainter stars .",
    "nevertheless , the superposition of the tts on the cloud and the similar radial velocities of at least two of the stars with the gas are strong evidence to support that the tts are associated with the cloud .",
    "since both ctts and wtts are typically @xmath0  10@xmath2010@xmath21 times more luminous in the x - ray region of the spectrum than average ( i.e. , older ) low - mass stars ( damiani et al .",
    "1995 ) , we made use of the _ rosat _ pointed and the rass observations of mbm12 to identify previously unknown tts in the cloud .",
    "the 25  ks _ rosat _ pspc pointed observation ( sequence number 900138 ) was centered at ( ra , dec ) @xmath0 ( 2:57:04.8,+19:50:24 ) .",
    "although they were originally discovered by other means , all of the previously known tts in the central region of mbm12 were also detected with _",
    "rosat_. since the extent of the molecular gas is not known ( in particular for the mbm13 region ) and tts can sometimes be displaced several parsecs from their parent clouds , we also searched in the rass database in a @xmath0  25  deg@xmath22  region around mbm12 .",
    "details about _ rosat _ and its pspc detector can be found in trmper ( 1983 ) and briel & pfeffermann ( 1995 ) , respectively . the rass broad - band image of the region investigated around mbm12 and the _ rosat _ pointed observation",

    "the one previously known tts candidate , s18 , near the cloud mbm13 was detected in the rass with a ml = 6.4 ( i.e. , below our threshold ) , however , since our optical spectroscopic observations confirm that it is a tts we include it in our study .",
    "we identified 49 x - ray sources in the _ rosat _ pspc pointed observation of mbm12 ( including all of the previously known tts in the central region of the cloud ) and 28 x - ray sources detected in the rass ( including s18 ) in the regions displayed in fig .",
    "[ xrayfig ] .",
    "three stars were detected both on the rass and in the pointed observation .",
    "we list the sources detected in the _ rosat _ pspc pointed observation and in the rass in table  4 .",
    "we include the _ rosat _ source name , the x - ray source coordinates , the maximum likelihood for existence for each source , the broad - band count rates , the x - ray hardness ratios @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( as defined in neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) , the apparent visual magnitude taken from the guide star catalog ( magnitudes for the fainter sources indicated with a `` : '' are estimated from the digitized sky survey images ) , and the broad - band x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "we also list the spectral type and the h@xmath11 and lithium equivalent widths of the sources that have been observed spectroscopically and comments collected from our search through the simbad and ned databases concerning the objects .    assuming a mean x - ray count - rate - to - flux conversion factor of 1.1  @xmath25  10@xmath26  erg  cts@xmath18  @xmath27 , which we derive from x - ray spectral fits of the tts in sect .",
    "[ xlf ] , if the cloud is at a distance of 65  pc , the limiting luminosities of the observations are @xmath28 erg s@xmath18 and @xmath29 erg s@xmath18 for the rass and _ rosat _ pointed observations , respectively .",
    "therefore , these observations are sufficient to detect most of the wtts in the cloud since the threshold is below the x - ray faintest stars in the wtts x - ray luminosity function ( e.g. , neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 ) . although the rass observation of mbm12 in not sensitive enough to detect all of the ctts in the cloud , the objective prism survey by stephenson ( 1986 ) identified all of the h@xmath11 emission sources in this region down to a visual magnitude threshold of @xmath0  13.5 .",
    "since this limiting magnitude corresponds to the early m spectral types in mbm12 , the current population of tts in mbm12 presented in this paper should be complete for all earlier spectral types .",
    "since mbm12 is at relatively high galactic latitude , many of the 81 x - ray sources we identified are extragalactic .",
    "therefore , we used the x - ray to optical flux ratios ( see table  4 ) to remove extragalactic sources from our list of candidates ( cf .",
    "hearty et al .  1999 ) .",
    "all sources which have log(@xmath30 )  @xmath4  0.0 are considered to be extragalactic and those with log(@xmath30 )  @xmath12  0.0 are considered to be stellar objects , some of which could be pms .",
    "we also searched the literature to remove cataloged non - pms stars from our list of candidates .",
    "finally we were left with a list of x - ray sources identified in the rass and _ rosat _ pointed observations of the cloud which have stellar optical counterparts that may be pms stars . however",
    ", many of these stars may be other types of x - ray active stars ( e.g. , rs cvn and dme stars ) and nearby main sequence stars ( which may not be intrinsically x - ray bright , but are near enough so that their x - ray flux is large ) that are more difficult to separate from pms stars by x - ray observations alone .",
    "therefore , follow - up spectral observations are necessary to identify which x - ray sources are t  tauri stars .",
    "in order to complete the census of the tts population of mbm12 we require follow - up observations . since lithium is burned quickly in convective stars , a measurement of w(li ) along with a knowledge of the spectral type of a star can be a reliable indicator of youth .",
    "therefore we obtained broad - band , low - resolution , optical spectra of the x - ray emitting tts candidates to determine spectral types and measure the equivalent width of the h@xmath11 emission and 6708    absorption lines .",
    "the spectra were obtained from october 911 , 1998 with the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) at the 2.2-m telescope at calar alto , spain .",
    "the 24@xmath15 m pixels of the site-1d 2048@xmath252048 chip with the g-100 grism provided a reciprocal dispersion of @xmath0  2.1    pixel@xmath18 . the resolving power , @xmath31 = @xmath32 @xmath0 1000 , derived from the measurement of the fwhm ( fwhm  @xmath0  6.4   ) of several well isolated emission lines of the comparison spectra is sufficient to resolve the lithium absorption line in t  tauri stars . the wavelength range @xmath0  4900 to 7800    was chosen to detect two indicators of possible youth ( h@xmath11 emission and  @xmath336708    absorption ) and to determine spectral types .",
    "all spectra were given an initial inspection at the telescope .",
    "if a particular star showed signs of youth or the integration produced fewer than @xmath0  1000 cts pixel@xmath18 , at least one additional integration was performed .",

    "although there is still a large uncertainty in the mass of the cloud the estimated star - formation efficiencies are consistent with that expected from clouds with masses on the order of 100  m@xmath6 ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . by comparing the strengths of the h@xmath11 emission and @xmath336708    absorption lines of the tts in mbm12 with those found in other young clusters , we place an upper limit on the age of the stars in mbm12 @xmath0 10  myr .    by comparing the x - ray luminosity function of the tts in mbm12 with that of the tts in l1495e",
    "we predict that there are more young , low - mass , stars to be discovered in mbm12 and the assumed distance to the cloud may have to be increased .",
    "although this prediction agrees with the recently revised distance estimate to the cloud ( @xmath0 @xmath2  pc ) based on results of the _ hipparcos _ satellite , it should be confirmed with future observations .",

    "therefore , there are at least two lines of sight through the cloud that show larger extinctions ( @xmath3 @xmath4 5  mag ) than previously thought for this cloud .",
