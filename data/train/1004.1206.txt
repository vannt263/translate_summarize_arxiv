    "diffusion in stationary states may be encountered either in equilibrium , where no macroscopic mass or energy fluxes are present in a system of many diffusing particles , or away from equilibrium , where diffusion is often driven by a density gradient between two open segments of the surface that encloses the space in which particles diffuse . in equilibrium states ,",
    "one is interested in the _ self - diffusion _",
    "coefficient @xmath3 , as given by the mean - square displacement ( msd ) of a tagged particle .",
    "this quantity , also called tracer diffusion coefficient , can be measured using e.g.  neutron scattering , nmr or direct video imaging in the case of colloidal particles . in gradient - driven non - equilibrium",
    "steady states , there is a particle flux between the boundaries which is proportional to the density gradient .",
    "this factor of proportionality is the so - called transport or collective diffusion coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "often these two diffusion coefficients can not be measured simultaneously under concrete experimental conditions and the question arises whether one can infer knowledge about the other diffusion coefficient , given one of them .",
    "generally , in dense systems these diffusion coefficients depend in a complicated fashion on the interaction between the diffusing particles . in the case of diffusion in microporous media ,",
    "e.g.  in zeolites , however , the mean free path of the particles is of the order of the pore diameter or even larger",
    ". then diffusion is dominated by the interaction of particles with the pore walls rather than by direct interaction between particles . in this",
    "dilute so - called knudsen regime neither @xmath3 nor @xmath4 depend on the particle density anymore , but are just given by the low - density limits of these two quantities .",
    "one then expects @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be equal .",
    "this assumption is a fundamental input into the interpretation of many experimental data , see e.g.  @xcite for an overview of diffusion in condensed matter systems .    not long ago this basic tenet has been challenged by monte - carlo simulation of knudsen diffusion in pores with fractal pore walls @xcite .",
    "the authors of these ( and further ) studies concluded that self - diffusion depends on the surface roughness of a pore , while transport diffusion is independent of it .",
    "in other words , the authors of @xcite argue that even in the low density limit , where the gas particle are independent of each other and interact only with the pore walls , @xmath5 , with a dependence of @xmath3 on the details of the pore walls that @xmath4 does not exhibit .",
    "this counterintuitive numerical finding was quickly questioned on physical grounds and contradicted by further simulations  @xcite which give approximate equality of the two diffusion coefficients .",
    "these controversial results gave rise to a prolonged debate which finally led to the consensus that indeed both diffusion coefficients should agree for the knudsen case  @xcite .",
    "it has remained open though whether these diffusion coefficients are generally exactly equal or only approximately to a degree depending on the details of the specific setting .    a physical argument put forward in  @xcite suggests general equality .",
    "to see this one imagines the following _",
    "gedankenexperiment_. imagine one colours in a equilibrium setting of many non - interacting particles some of these particles without changing their properties . at some distance from this colouring region",
    "the colour is removed .",
    "then these coloured particles experience a density gradient just as `` normal '' particles in an open system with the same pore walls would .",
    "since the walls are essentially the same and the properties of coloured and uncoloured particles are the same , the statistical properties of the ensemble of trajectories remain unchanged .",
    "hence one expects any pore roughness to have the same effect on diffusion , irrespective of whether one consider transport diffusion or self - diffusion .",
    "notice , however , that this microscopic argument , while intuitively appealing , is far from rigorous .",
    "first , the precise conditions under which the independence of the diffusion coefficients on the pore surface is supposed to be valid , is not specified .",
    "this is more than a technical issue since one may easily construct surface properties leading to non - diffusive behaviour ( cf .",
    "second , there is no obvious microscopic interpretation or unique microscopic definition of the transport diffusion coefficient for arbitrary surface structures .",
    "@xmath4 is a genuinely macroscopic quantity and a proof of equality between @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( which is naturally microscopically defined through the asymptotic long - time behaviour of the msd ) requires some further work and new ideas .",
    "one needs to establish that on large scales the knudsen process converges to brownian motion ( which then also gives @xmath3 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to compare @xmath4 and @xmath3 one needs a precise macroscopic definition of @xmath4 which is independent of microscopic properties of the system .    the first part of this programme is carried out in  @xcite .",
    "there we proved the quenched invariance principle for the horizontal projection of the particle s position using the method of considering the environment viewed from the particle .",
    "this method is useful in a number of models related to markov processes in a random environment , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to solve the second problem of defining @xmath4 and proving equality with @xmath3 . as in  @xcite",
    "we consider a random tube to model pore roughness .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , we now have to consider tubes of finite extension along the tube contour and introduce open segments at the ends of the tube .",
    "doing this rigorously then clarifies some of the salient assumptions underlying the equality of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "naturally , since we are in the dilute gas limit , there is no dependence on the particle density in either of the two diffusion constants .",
    "this obvious point has not been controversial and will not be stressed below .",
    "we note that we define @xmath4 through stationary transport in an open system since this is accessible experimentally as well as numerically in monte carlo simulation .",
    "indeed , in the literature that gave rise to the controversy that we address here , this way of defining @xmath4 is used , albeit in a non - rigorous fashion . sticking to this experimentally motivated setting we shall give below a precise definition that can be used to prove rigorously that under rather generic circumstances @xmath6 , which means that both diffusion constants depend on the pore surface in the same way .",
    "as pointed out above , this equality is expected from independence of the particles and the invariance principle for the process and its time - reversed .",
    "however , we could not find a general result applying here , and moreover , as it turns out , the proof is not entirely trivial .",
    "there are some technical difficulties to overcome because the quenched invariance principle of definition  [ def_invariance_principle ] below is not very `` strong '' ( there is no uniformity assumption on the speed of convergence as a function of the initial conditions ) and the jumps of the embedded discrete - time billiard are not uniformly bounded .",
    "let us mention here that it is generally difficult to obtain stronger results in the above sense , since the corrector technique , generally used in the proof of quenched central limit theorems for reversible markov processes in random environment , is still not sufficiently well understood .    to further illuminate the contents of our results we point out that in a bulk system the equality of the self - diffusion coefficient and the transport diffusion coefficient for the spread of _ equilibrium _ density fluctuations in an infinite system may be taken for granted in the case of particles that have no mutual interaction . hence another way of stating the main conclusion of our work is the assertion that the transport diffusion coefficient as defined here in a stationary _ far - from - equilibrium _ setting coincides with the usual equilibrium transport diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also address finite - size effects coming from the fact that we are dealing with diffusion in a finite , open geometry .",
    "this causes deviations from bulk results for first - passage - time properties if a tagged particle starts its motion close to one boundary . in particular",
    ", we compute the permeation time and the milne extrapolation length that characterizes the survival time of a particle injected at a boundary .    as a final introductory remark",
    ", it is worth noting that the case of knudsen gas with the cosine reflection law ( which is the model considered in this paper ) is particularly easy to analyse because the stationary state can be written in an explicit form , cf.theorem  [ t_stat_measure ] .",
    "as explained below , this is related to the following facts : ( i ) there is no interaction between particles , ( ii ) for random billiard ( i.e. , a motion of only one particle in a closed domain ) with the cosine reflection law the stationary measure is quite explicit , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "similar questions are much more complicated when the explicit form of the stationary state is not known .",
    "this is the general situation for non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "we refer to e.g.  the model of  @xcite ( a chain of coupled oscillators ) where one resorts to a bound on the entropy production .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ s_defin ]",
    "we define the infinite random tube , and then introduce the process we call random billiard . in section  [ s_transport ] , we then consider a gas of independent particles with absorption / injection in a finite piece of the random tube , and we formulate our results on the stationary measure for that gas and on the transport diffusion coefficient . in section  [ s_perm ] , we go on to formulate first passage time results that concern exit from and crossing of the finite tube by a tagged particle .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the proof of our results . in section  [ s_pr_prelim ]",
    "we mainly use the reversibility of the process to obtain several technical facts used later . in section  [ s_pr_steady ]",
    "we prove the result on the stationary measure of the knudsen gas in the finite tube .",
    "section  [ s_pr_trans ] contains the proofs of the results related to the transport diffusion coefficient , and in section  [ s_pr_perm ] we prove the results related to the crossing of the finite tube .",
    "naively the transport diffusion coefficient in tube direction  @xmath7 may be defined through the diffusion equation for the probability density @xmath8 , where a possible @xmath7-dependence may originate from a spatial inhomogeneity of the tube .",
    "denote by  @xmath9 the particle current in the system ; assuming stationarity with a probability density @xmath10 one has @xmath11 . with fixed external densities  @xmath12 at @xmath13 and  @xmath14 at @xmath15 one",
    "finds by integration @xmath16 with density gradient @xmath17 and @xmath18 . by measuring the current and the boundary densities one",
    "can thus obtain the transport diffusion coefficient without having to determine the local quantity @xmath19 .",
    "this result , however , implies knowledge of the local coarse - grained boundary densities  @xmath20 to be able to make any comparison with @xmath3 . in a real experimental setting as well as for a given microscopic model these boundary densities  @xmath20 are difficult to obtain . in particular , there is no well - defined prescription where precisely on a microscopic scale these boundary quantities should be measured .",
    "we circumvent the problem of computing these quantities from microscopic considerations by considering the total number of particles in the tube rather than local properties of the boundary region of the tube . together with proving a large - scale linear density profile in a stationary open random tube , one",
    "may then infer the macroscopic density gradient , see the definition  ( [ defdtrans ] ) below .",
    "thus one obtains a macroscopic definition of the transport diffusion coefficient which is independent of microscopic details of the model .      in order to fix ideas in a mathematically rigorous form we first recall some notations from  @xcite .",
    "let us formally define the random tube in  @xmath21 , @xmath22 . in this paper",
    ", @xmath23 will always stand for the linear subspace of @xmath21 which is perpendicular to the first coordinate vector  @xmath24 , we use the notation  @xmath25 for the euclidean norm in  @xmath21 or  @xmath23 . for @xmath26",

    "let @xmath31 be the half - sphere looking in the direction  @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath33 , sometimes it will be convenient to write @xmath34 , being  @xmath35 the first coordinate of  @xmath7 and @xmath36 ; then , @xmath37 , and we write @xmath38 , being  @xmath39 the projector on  @xmath23 .",
    "fix some positive constant  @xmath40 , and define @xmath41    let  @xmath42 be an open connected domain in  @xmath23 or  @xmath21 .",
    "we denote by  @xmath43 the boundary of  @xmath42 and by  @xmath44 the closure of  @xmath42 .",
    "the random tube is viewed as a stationary and ergodic process @xmath45 , where  @xmath46 is a subset of  @xmath47 ; cf .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed definition .",
    "we denote by  @xmath48 the law of this process ; sometimes we will use the shorthand notation @xmath49 for the expectation with respect to  @xmath48 . with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we denote also by @xmath50 the random tube itself , where the billiard lives . intuitively , @xmath46 is the `` slice '' obtained by crossing  @xmath51 with the hyperplane @xmath52 .",
    "we will assume that the domain @xmath51 is defined in such a way that it is an open subset of @xmath21 , and that it is connected .",
    "we write also  @xmath53 for the closure of  @xmath51 . in order to define the random billiard correctly , following  @xcite , throughout this paper we suppose that @xmath48-almost surely  @xmath54 is a @xmath55-dimensional surface satisfying the lipschitz condition .",
    "this means that for any  @xmath56 there exist  @xmath57 , an affine isometry @xmath58 , a function @xmath59 such that    * @xmath60 satisfies lipschitz condition , i.e. , there exists a constant  @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 ; * @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66    roughly speaking , lipschitz condition implies that any boundary point can be `` touched '' by a piece of a cone which lies fully inside the tube .",
    "this in its turn ensures that the ( discrete - time ) process can not remain in a small neighborhood of some boundary point for very long time ; in section  2.2 of  @xcite one can find an example of a non - lipschitz domain where the random billiard behaves in an unusual way .",
    "we keep the usual notation @xmath67 for the @xmath55-dimensional lebesgue measure on  @xmath47 ( usually restricted to @xmath46 for some  @xmath35 ) or haar measure on  @xmath68 .",
    "we write @xmath69 for the @xmath70-dimensional lebesgue measure in case @xmath71 , and haar measure in case @xmath72 .",
    "also , we denote by  @xmath73 the @xmath55-dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath54 ; since the boundary is lipschitz , one obtains that  @xmath73 is locally finite ( cf .",
    "the proof of lemma  3.1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume additionally that the boundary of @xmath48-a.e .",
    "@xmath51 is @xmath73-a.e .",
    "_ continuously _ differentiable , and we denote by @xmath74 the set of boundary points where  @xmath54 is continuously differentiable .    to avoid complications when cutting a ( large ) finite piece of the infinite random tube , we assume that there exists a constant @xmath75 such that for @xmath48-almost all environments  @xmath51 we have the following : for any @xmath76 with @xmath77 there exists a path connecting @xmath78 that lies fully inside  @xmath51 and has length at most  @xmath75 .    for all @xmath79 , let us define the normal vector @xmath80 pointing inside the domain  @xmath51 .",
    "we say that @xmath81 is _ seen from _",
    "@xmath82 if there exists @xmath83 and  @xmath84 such that @xmath85 for all @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "clearly , if  @xmath88 is seen from  @xmath7 then  @xmath7 is seen from  @xmath88 , and we write `` @xmath89 '' when this occurs .",
    "next , we construct the knudsen random walk ( krw ) @xmath90 , which is a discrete time markov process on  @xmath54 , cf .",
    "section  2.2 of  @xcite .",
    "it is defined through its transition density  @xmath91 : for @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the normalizing constant , and  @xmath95 stands for the indicator function .",
    "this means that , being @xmath96 the quenched ( i.e. , with fixed  @xmath51 ) probability and expectation , for any @xmath79 and any measurable @xmath97 we have @xmath98 = { \\int\\limits}_b k(x , y)\\ , d{\\nu^\\omega}(y).\\ ] ] we also refer to the knudsen random walk as the random walk with cosine reflection law , since it is elementary to obtain from   that the density of the outgoing direction is proportional to the cosine of the angle between this direction and the normal vector .",
    "[ rem_not_to_infty ] in fact , in the general setting of  @xcite , for unbounded domains , one has to consider the following possibility : at some moment the particle chooses the outgoing direction in such a way that , moving in this direction , it never hits the boundary of the domain again , thus going directly to the infinity .",
    "however , it is straightforward to see that , since @xmath99 , in our situation @xmath100-a.s",
    ".  this can not happen .",
    "it is immediate to obtain from   that @xmath101 is symmetric ( that is , @xmath102 for all @xmath92 ) ; for both the discrete- and continuous - time processes this leads to some nice reversibility properties , exploited in  @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath91 depends on  @xmath51 as well , but we usually do not indicate this in the notations in order to keep them simple . also , let us denote by  @xmath103 the @xmath104-step transition density ; clearly , one obtains that  @xmath105 is symmetric too for any  @xmath106 .",
    "now , we define the knudsen stochastic billiard ( ksb ) @xmath107 , which is the main object of study in this paper .",
    "first , we do that for the process starting on the boundary  @xmath54 from the point  @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be the trajectory of the random walk , and define @xmath110 then , for @xmath111 , define @xmath112 in proposition  2.1 of  @xcite it was shown that , provided that the boundary satisfies the lipschitz condition , we have @xmath113 @xmath100-a.s . ,",
    "and so  @xmath114 is well - defined for all @xmath115 . the quantity  @xmath114 stands for the position of the particle at time  @xmath116 ; since it is not a markov process by itself , we define also the cdlg version of the motion direction at time  @xmath116 : @xmath117 observe that @xmath118 .",
    "recall also another notation from  @xcite : for @xmath119 , @xmath120 , define ( with the convention @xmath121 ) @xmath122 so that @xmath123 is the next point where the particle hits the boundary when starting at the location  @xmath7 with the direction  @xmath124 . of course , we can define also the stochastic billiard starting from the interior of  @xmath51 by specifying its initial position  @xmath125 and initial direction  @xmath126 : the particle starts at the position  @xmath125 and moves in the direction  @xmath126 with unit speed until hitting the boundary at the point @xmath127 ; then , the previous construction is applied , being @xmath127 the starting boundary point .",
    "we denote by @xmath128 the ( quenched ) law of ksb in the tube  @xmath51 starting from  @xmath7 with the initial direction  @xmath124 .",
    "consider the rescaled projected trajectory @xmath129 of ksb .",

    "[ rem_clt ] in the paper  @xcite we prove that , if the second moment of the projected jump length with respect to the stationary measure for the environment seen from the particle is finite ( which is true for @xmath138 , but not always for @xmath144 ) , then under certain additional conditions ( related to condition  t of the present paper ) , the quenched invariance principle holds for the knudsen stochastic billiard in the infinite random tube , cf .",
    "theorem  2.2 , propositions  2.1 and  2.2 of  @xcite .",
    "let us comment more on the above condition  t :    * in  @xcite , instead of the `` uniform dblin condition '' ( ii ) , we assumed a more explicit ( although a bit more technical ) condition  p , which implies that ( ii ) holds ( see lemma  3.6 of  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in the proof of the quenched invariance principle the technical condition of  @xcite is used only through the fact that it implies the uniform dblin condition . *",
    "the assumption we made for @xmath144 may seem to be too restrictive . however , is it only a bit more restrictive that the assumption that the random tube does not contain an infinite straight cylinder .",
    "as it was shown in proposition  2.2 of  @xcite , if the random tube contains an infinite straight cylinder , then the averaged second moment of the projected jump length is infinite in dimension  @xmath150 , and so the ( quenched ) invariance principle can not be valid .",
    "now , let us introduce the notations specific to this paper . consider a positive number  @xmath151 ( which is typically supposed to be large ) ;",

    "then , we consider a gas of independent particles in  @xmath152 , described as follows .",
    "there is usual reflection on  @xmath158 ; any particle which hits @xmath159 , disappears .",
    "in addition , for a given @xmath160 , new particles are injected in  @xmath161 with intensity  @xmath162 per unit surface area .",
    "every newly injected particle chooses the initial direction at random according to the cosine law .",
    "in other words , the injection in  @xmath161 is given by an independent poisson process in @xmath163 with intensity @xmath164 .",
    "[ rem_cosine_chosen ] the choice of the cosine law for the injection of new particles is justified by theorem  2.9 of  @xcite : for the ksb in a finite domain , the long - run empirical law of intersection with a @xmath55-dimensional manifold is cosine .",
    "one may think of the following situation : the random tube is connected from its left side  @xmath161 to a very large reservoir containing the knudsen gas in the stationary regime ; then , the particles cross  @xmath161 with approximately cosine law ( at least on the time scale when the density of the particles in the big reservoir remains unaffected by the outflow through the tube ) . in section  [ s_pr_steady ] ( proof of theorem  [ t_stat_measure ] )",

    "@xmath4 is defined by @xmath173 now , suppose that the quenched invariance principle with constant  @xmath174 holds for the stochastic billiard .",
    "our goal is to prove that @xmath4 is equal to the _ self - diffusion coefficient _ @xmath175 . to this end , we prove the following two results .",
    "first , we prove that the coarse - grained density profile is indeed linear :    [ t_dens_grad ] suppose that the quenched invariance principle holds",
    ". then , for any @xmath176 there exists  @xmath177 such that @xmath48-a.s .",
    "@xmath178    then , we calculate the limiting current :    [ t_current ] suppose that the quenched invariance principle holds with constant  @xmath174 , and assume also that condition  t holds .",
    "then , we have @xmath48-a.s . @xmath179    some remarks are in place that illustrate the significance of the above theorems .",
    "theorem  [ t_dens_grad ] means that @xmath180 , and using also theorem  [ t_current ] , we obtain that @xmath6 . at the same time",
    "it becomes clear that such a statement can be true only asymptotically since in a finite open tube one has to expect finite size corrections of the mean particle number .",
    "these corrections may , in fact , depend strongly on the microscopic shape of the tube near the open boundaries .",
    "this implies that in experiments on real spatially inhomogeneous systems some care has to be taken as to what is measured as macroscopic density gradient .",
    "notice that with theorem  [ t_current ] we also prove fick s law for diffusive transport of matter in the random knudsen stochastic billiard . since the velocity of the particles does not change at collisions with the tube walls , mass transport is proportional to energy transport . in this interpretation theorem  [ t_current ] implies fourier s law for heat conduction , see e.g.  @xcite for recent work on other processes .    for a function @xmath181 and @xmath182 ,",
    "denote @xmath183 as mentioned in the introduction , in the proof of theorems  [ t_dens_grad ] and  [ t_current ] we use the explicit form of the steady state for the knudsen gas in the random tube with injection from one side .",
    "let us formulate the following theorem :    [ t_stat_measure ]     * for the knudsen gas with absorption / injection in @xmath184 ( as before , with intensity @xmath162 per unit surface area ) the unique stationary state is poisson point process in @xmath185 with intensity  @xmath186 .",
    "* for the gas with injection in  @xmath161 only , the unique stationary distribution of the particle configuration is given by a poisson point process in  @xmath187 with intensity measure @xmath188    \\,d\\alpha\\ , du\\ , dh.\\ ] ]    also , in both cases , for any initial configuration the process converges to the stationary state described above .",
    "of course , the above result is not quite unexpected .",
    "it is well known that independent systems have poisson invariant distributions ( with the single particle invariant measure for poisson intensity ) , let us mention e.g.  @xcite ( section  viii.5 ) and  @xcite .",
    "still , we decided to include the proof of this theorem because ( as far as we know ) , it does not directly follow from any of the existing results available in the literature .",
    "let us introduce some more notations for the finite random tube .",
