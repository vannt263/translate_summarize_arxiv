    "the competition of particle - hole and cluster excitations is one of the most interesting issues in the structure of light nuclei . they emphasize different aspects of nuclear excitation modes , and often coexist in low - lying spectrum .",
    "both the excitations are usually described in quite different languages , thus defying the reproduction of such a coexistence in a single scheme .",
    "in fact some intruder states have remained unresolved even in a large - space calculation based on realistic interactions .",
    "for example , the excitation energy of the so - called hoyle state which is recognized to have large overlap with 3@xmath8 configuration  @xcite is predicted too high in the no - core shell model  @xcite . according to the shell model",
    ", negative - parity states should appear first in the excited spectrum of @xmath9o , but they show up just above the first excited @xmath10 state which is also understandable from @xmath11c+@xmath8 structure  @xcite .    the @xmath12he nucleus is a lightest system offering a coexisting spectrum .",
    "its ground state is doubly magic and tightly bound , but its first excited state is not a negative parity but @xmath10 , similarly to @xmath9o .",
    "this state was first conjectured as a breathing mode , but an extensive study has confirmed it as a cluster state of @xmath13+@xmath14 ( @xmath5h+@xmath6 and @xmath5he+@xmath7 ) configuration  @xcite . accepting this interpretation for this state ,",
    "we are led to the following questions . since the @xmath13 and @xmath14 clusters having spin 1/2 and isospin 1/2 move in a relative @xmath15 wave",
    ", four states may appear which all have basically the same @xmath13+@xmath14 configuration but different @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "these states may be called quadruplets .",
    "the first question we set here is ` why do we actually observe only one of them , @xmath18 ? '    the second question is concerned with the concept of an inversion doublet which is known in molecular spectroscopy . for a system consisting of asymmetric molecules ( clusters )",
    ", one may expect a partner state of negative parity as in the ammonia molecule .",
    "these positive- and negative - parity pairs are called inversion doublets . on the analogy of the molecule we may ask a question ` what about the possibility of observing negative - parity partners in which the @xmath13 and @xmath14 clusters move in a relative @xmath19 wave ? ' the negative - parity partners would have @xmath20=@xmath21 , and/or @xmath4 , which result from the coupling of the spins of the two clusters and the relative orbital angular momentum between them .",
    "the centrifugal barrier for the @xmath19 wave is more than 3mev at the @xmath13-@xmath14 relative distance of 4fm , so that the expected partner states may appear in the region of the excitation energy @xmath1=21 - 23 mev .",
    "in fact the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are observed in this region .",
    "traditionally , these states are considered @xmath22 shell - model states , but could be better understood from the @xmath13+@xmath14 configuration .",
    "the atms variational calculation seems to suggest this picture for the negative - parity states  @xcite but no discussion was made on the relationship between them and the @xmath23 state . according to recent large - space shell - model calculations ,",
    "these @xmath24 states show quite different convergence  @xcite : because of its slow convergence , the @xmath23 state is attributed to a radial excitation .",
    "the purpose of this study is to answer the two questions by performing four - body calculations with realistic potentials .",
    "thus we are mainly interested in the three excited states , @xmath18(@xmath1=20.21 mev ) , @xmath25(21.01 mev ) , and @xmath26(21.84 mev ) , but also consider other excited states which all have a width larger than 5mev .",
    "we will not invoke any model ansatz , that is , our calculation is based on neither the shell model nor an rgm calculation  @xcite which couples @xmath5h+@xmath6 , @xmath5he+@xmath7 , and @xmath27+@xmath27 two - cluster channels , but treat four nucleons equally in an unconstrained configuration space .",
    "we will obtain the energies and wave functions of the excited states of @xmath0he in a basis expansion method .",
    "the basis used here is square integrable , so that the excited states are obtained in a bound - state approximation .",
    "as we show later , this approximation works fairly well for predicting the three lowest - lying excited states , but it gives only a qualitative prediction for the other broad levels .",
    "section  [ formulation ] gives a brief description of the basis functions used to solve the four - body problem .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath28 for a system of two protons and two neutrons consists of the kinetic energy ( @xmath29 ) and a nucleon - nucleon potential including the coulomb potential ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the center of mass kinetic energy is properly subtracted .",
    "a three - body force is ignored as it has a small effect on the spectrum above the @xmath13+@xmath14 threshold  @xcite .",

    "the tensor and spin - orbit forces of the av8@xmath31 potential are , however , stronger than those of the g3rs potential , while the central force of the av8@xmath31 potential is weaker than the one of the g3rs potential .    a variational solution @xmath37 for the schrdinger equation is obtained by taking a linear combination of many basis states , each of which has the following form @xmath38_l\\!\\chi_s\\right]_{jm_j } \\!\\eta_{tm_t}\\big\\},\\label{basis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a solid spherical harmonic .",

    "the accuracy of our solution depends on the basis dimension and the optimization of the variational parameters .",
    "the selection of the parameters is performed by the stochastic variational method  @xcite .",
    "as all the states but the ground state are resonances , increasing the basis size unconditionally does not always lead to a solution we are seeking .",
    "namely , if the variational parameters are allowed to reach very far in the spatial region , the energy for the excited state would fall down to the @xmath5h+@xmath6 threshold .",
    "some details of the calculation are given below .",
    "the @xmath67 parameters are restricted to @xmath68fm for all the states but the @xmath69 state .",

    "we found that using 600 basis states of the form given in eq .",

    "figure  [ e-conv.fig ] displays the energy convergence of the three lowest - lying negative - parity states with @xmath16=@xmath75 , and @xmath76 as a function of basis dimension .",
    "the energies of these states are considerably stable for the increase of basis functions , though they do not have proper asymptotic behavior characteristic of a resonance .",
    "the energies of the other levels are not very accurately obtained .",
    "they have a large width , so that we think our calculation gives only an approximate energy .",
    "in particular we found that the energy of the @xmath69 state , which has a width of about 8mev , was not as stable as the other states .",
    "we thus obtained its energy by restricting the range of @xmath67 as @xmath77fm .",
    "figure  [ spectrum.fig ] compares the spectrum of @xmath12he between theory and experiment .",
    "the calculated binding energy of @xmath5h is 7.73mev for g3rs and 7.76mev for av8@xmath31  @xcite .",
    "thus the calculated @xmath5h+@xmath6 threshold energy does not agree by about 0.7mev with the experimental one .",
    "the theoretical spectrum in the figure is drawn by shifting the calculated energies downward so as to adjust this difference of the threshold energy .",
    "the theory reproduces the level sequence of the spectrum as a whole and especially the excitation energies of the @xmath78 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 states very well .",
    "the levels above @xmath1=23mev are predicted to be slightly lower than experiment except for the @xmath69 level with av8@xmath31 .",
    "as their widths are all larger than 5mev , this discrepancy may be allowable in the bound - state approximation for unbound states .",
    "noteworthy is that the calculation predicts three states with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 around @xmath82=23mev , as denoted by dashed lines .",
    "these states together with the @xmath23 state are the quadruplets relevant to the first question .",
    "as speculated , they show up in the present calculation , but no such states are observed experimentally .",

    "compared to the @xmath69 state , the @xmath25 state gains about 9mev energy from the tensor force , while the contribution of the central force to the energy gain is only about its half .",
    "the energy contents given by the av8@xmath31 potential are similar to those of the g3rs potential : the gain by the tensor force is even larger , about 12mev and the central force gives 3mev difference .",
    "the tensor force is most attractive in the triplet even @xmath84 state , and it can be taken advantage of by having more number of antisymmetric @xmath84 pairs in the isospin space . the number of such antisymmetric pairs is counted from @xmath85 , which is @xmath86/8 $ ] for @xmath43-nucleon system . thus the @xmath25 state gains more attraction than the @xmath69 state through both the ( 11)-(11 ) diagonal and ( 11)-(22 ) off - diagonal contributions  @xcite .",
    "if the unnatural parity basis were not included in the calculation , the @xmath87 value of the @xmath25 state would decrease to about half  @xcite and the @xmath25 state would lose significant energy .",
    "the role of the tensor force in lowering the energy of the @xmath25 state was discussed many years ago  @xcite . to be exact",
    ", the energy difference between the two states is actually a combined effect of the tensor , kinetic and central terms .",
    "now we discuss the characteristics of the low - lying negative - parity states from the viewpoint of clustering . in fig .",
    "[ rwa_minus.fig ] we display the @xmath5he+@xmath7 sas calculated from the three lowest - lying negative - parity states with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath88 value for the @xmath5he-@xmath7 relative motion is 1 , and the channel spin @xmath89 is 1 .",
    "as expected , each of the three curves shows behavior suggesting @xmath13+@xmath14 cluster structure : the peaks are centered around 2fm near the @xmath13 surface , and the @xmath90 values are fairly large in the inner region .",
    "it is the centrifugal potential that makes the peak positions closer to the origin than that of the first excited @xmath18 state .",
    "the @xmath13+@xmath14 spectroscopic factors are considerably large : 0.58 , 0.52 , and 0.53 for the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath76 states .",
    "we estimate the nucleon width .",
    "its channel - radius dependence is again mild , so we choose @xmath91=5fm . the results for ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , where @xmath92 is the total width in mev , are ( 0.61 , 0.72 ) , ( 1.14 , 0.58 ) , and ( 1.85 , 0.53 ) for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "these values are compared to those extracted from the @xmath94-matrix analysis  @xcite , ( 0.84 , 0.76 ) , ( 2.01 , 0.63 ) , and ( 5.01 , 0.53 ) .",
    "the theory predicts the width of the @xmath25 state very well , and gives about half of the width for the other states .",
    "though the degree of clustering is somewhat reduced in the negative - parity states compared to the @xmath2 case , the analysis of sa and decay width supports our conjecture that the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states as well as the @xmath76 state constitute inversion - doublet partners of the first excited @xmath10 state .",
    "the rgm phase - shift analysis of @xmath5h+@xmath6 scatterings  @xcite supports the @xmath19-wave resonance interpretation for these negative - parity states .",
    "the sas of the @xmath95 states around @xmath1=24mev show some degree of @xmath13+@xmath14 cluster structure , though their amplitudes are considerably small compared to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states in particular .",
    "an inversion doublet picture in nuclei was first proposed to understand the low - lying positive- and negative - parity rotation bands in @xmath9o and @xmath96ne from an @xmath8-core molecular structure  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of positive- and negative - parity partners is a natural consequence of the underlying intrinsic structure dominated by the existence of asymmetric clusters .",
    "we have shown that the three lowest - lying negative - parity states have a significant component of 3@xmath14 and @xmath14 clusters whose relative motion is in @xmath19-wave .",
    "it is important to realize that this result is obtained in the calculation which assumes no cluster ansatz for the wave functions .",
    "a physical reason for the appearance of the inversion doublet partners is that they are located near the @xmath13+@xmath14 threshold .    very unique in the inversion doublets in @xmath0he",
    "is that the @xmath13 and @xmath14 clusters have both @xmath97=@xmath98 , and the channel spin @xmath89 is different in the doublets : it is 0 for @xmath23 and 1 for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the negative - parity partners with @xmath29=0 should thus be characterized by the transition of an isoscalar spin - dipole operator , @xmath99=@xmath100_{\\lambda \\nu}$ ] , where @xmath101 is the center of mass of @xmath0he .",
    "note that @xmath102 is proportional to the distance vector between nucleon @xmath103 and the center of mass of the other three nucleons .",
    "the transition strength to the @xmath23 state , @xmath104 , is 11.9@xmath105 , which is 6.9 times larger than that to the ground state .",
    "moreover , the strength @xmath104 between the doublet partners occupies 58% of the `` sum rule '' @xmath106 , where @xmath7 takes all 600 eigenstates with @xmath18 .",
    "a similar enhancement occurs for the @xmath26 state as well .",
    "the value @xmath107 is 21.7@xmath105 , which is about 24 times larger than the one to the ground state , and it corresponds to 78% of the total sum @xmath108 .    for the transition between the @xmath76 and @xmath23 states , an isovector spin - dipole operator , @xmath109=@xmath100_{\\lambda \\nu } { \\tau}_{3_i}$ ] , must be considered .",
    "the transition strength @xmath110 is 17.4@xmath105 , which is 16 times larger than that to the ground state , where the triple bar @xmath111 indicates that the reduced matrix element is taken in both the angular momentum and isospin spaces .",
    "this strength between the @xmath76 and @xmath23 states occupies 87% of the total strength @xmath112 .",
    "the high collectivity of the spin - dipole strength strongly indicates that the intrinsic structure of the negative - parity states , @xmath113 , and @xmath76 , is similar to that of the first excited @xmath23 state .",
    "a rich spectrum of @xmath0he comprising the coexisting levels has been reproduced in a single scheme without recourse to a specific model assumption .",
    "this has offered a good example of demonstrating the power of the global vector representation for the angular part of few - body systems .",
    "we have explained how only the @xmath114 state is observed as a resonance among the quadruplets by examining the symmetry property of the wave functions as well as the role of the tensor force . analyzing the spectroscopic amplitudes , nucleon decay widths and spin - dipole transition probabilities ,",
    "we have confirmed that both the @xmath114 and negative - parity states with @xmath115 , and @xmath76 are dominated by the @xmath13+@xmath14 cluster structure and that these negative - parity states can be understood as the inversion doublet partners of the @xmath114 state in a unified way .",
    "we have shown that the tensor force plays a vital role to produce the level spacing between the @xmath3 states with @xmath29=0 and 1 through the coupling between the main channel with @xmath59=1 and the unnatural - parity channel with @xmath59=2 .",
    "a study of @xmath9o in the scheme of @xmath11c+four nucleons will be interesting as its spectrum has some similarity to that of @xmath0he .",
