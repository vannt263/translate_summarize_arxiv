    "unopposed radiative cooling of the intracluster medium ( icm ) would lead to the cooling catastrophe  an inflow of gas toward the center , due to the loss of pressure , at the rate of several hundred @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the main consequences would be strongly peaked surface brightness maps , central temperatures falling below @xmath7 , and a huge accumulation of cold gas in the cluster core , well over @xmath8 @xmath5 .",
    "the fact that none of these cooling flow features are observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) points out that either the cooling proceeds non - radiatively or it is balanced by some kind of heating .",
    "the most popular and promising heating mechanism is the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback .",
    "radio and x - ray data provide overwhelming evidence for the interaction of jets / outflows from the supermassive black holes with the surrounding icm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power supplied by the agn is in the range of @xmath9 erg s@xmath6 , adequate to globally offset radiative cooling losses .",
    "further support for the outflow model comes from blueshifted absorption lines in the core of several galaxies : in the optical band ( @xcite ) , uv and x - ray bands ( @xcite ; @xcite for a review ) , and at 21-cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "these lines originate at kpc distances and correspond to velocities of up to several @xmath10 km s@xmath6 and mass outflow rates around a @xmath5 yr@xmath6 or more .",
    "the geometry is still unclear , but radio images are suggestive of conical outflows with narrow opening angles and possibly consistent with precession .",
    "while the global energy balance may be achieved with the help of the agn feedback and/or other mechanisms @xcite , the issues regarding the coupling of the mechanical agn energy to the thermal icm energy , along with the spatial distribution of heating , are not settled .",
    "the coupling may occur , for example , via turbulent mixing of agn bubbles with the icm @xcite , viscous dissipation of weak shocks @xcite , and cosmic ray heating @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms may also help heat the icm and redistribute the energy throughout the cool core : dynamical friction @xcite , thermal conduction @xcite , or sloshing motions @xcite .    for most microscopic heating mechanisms",
    "the icm is expected to be locally thermally unstable .",
    "in other words , even if the icm maintains global thermal balance without a cooling flow , some of the gas can experience runaway cooling .",
    "indeed , the observations by @xcite and @xcite revealed that cooling flows are not totally stopped : the mass of cold gas , mainly dominated by molecular h@xmath11 associated with co emission , reaches @xmath12 @xmath5 in the majority of cool - core clusters . cooling may also be inferred from star formation ( e.g. , odea 2008 , typically @xmath13 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) . more recently",
    ", a wide survey conducted by @xcite utilized h@xmath2 emission as a robust tracer of the cold phase . in more than 60% of clusters and groups , extended and/or nuclear cold gas was detected .",
    "the morphology of this phase is usually clumpy or filamentary and elongated toward the center ( e.g. , in the perseus cluster ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown the existence of a tight correlation between the amount of cold gas and the icm entropy or the cooling time .",
    "only clusters with central entropies below 30 kev @xmath14 show evidence for the extended cold gas . this criterion can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the cooling time ( @xmath15 and @xmath15 interchangeably . ] ) and the free - fall time ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "analytical estimates and cartesian simulations by @xcite ( @xcite  m11 ) pointed out that a spatially extended and inhomogeneous cold phase can form whenever @xmath17 .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) did not predict the presence of multiphase gas because they neglected a spatially distributed heating , which provides global thermal stability .",
    "12 in m11 , based on observational data , suggests that the critical threshold is actually higher , @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite  s11 ) extended the work of m11 , considering spherical feedback models .",
    "they found that , due to the geometrical compression , the criterion is in fact less stringent : instability occurs when @xmath19 .",
    "the results presented in m11 and s11 are very promising , but the distributed heating models adopted there are idealized . in these models the heating is either added using a prescribed spherically - symmetric functional form , or it is constructed to be equal to the shell - averaged radiative cooling loss at every radius . given the simplicity of these prescriptions , it is necessary to consider more realistic heating models to reliably study the formation of the multiphase medium , along with reproducing several important features , such as shocks , cavities and turbulence . we perform high - resolution three - dimensional simulations which incorporate icm heating via collimated agn jets .",
    "this study is also a natural extension of our previous efforts ( @xcite  g11a , b ) , which included agn jet feedback but mainly focused on the dynamics of the hot icm phase , suppressing the formation of the multiphase gas via cold phase dropout .",
    "our more realistic agn feedback simulations confirm that extended multiphase icm forms only when the _ instantaneous _ ratio of the thermal instability and free - fall timescales falls below a critical threshold of @xmath1 , irrespective of the initial condition .",
    "the cluster core attains rough thermal equilibrium after a few cooling times .",
    "in addition to occasional extended cold filaments , centrally concentrated cold gas exists at most times .",
    "thus agn feedback primarily occurs via the cold phase .",
    "our simulations also show that sometimes the cold gas can be carried out by agn jets .",
    "the evidence for such cold filaments dredged out from the central galaxy is seen in the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "we use the adaptive mesh refinement code flash 4.0 ( @xcite ) , modified to simulate mechanical agn feedback in the cooling icm .",

    "our implementations of the cooling and jet flux terms in equations ( [ cont ] )  ( [ ene ] ) deserve careful discussion and are presented in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , respectively .",
    "we decided to neglect magnetic fields and anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "m11 showed that the anisotropic conduction changes the morphology of the cold gas ( more filamentary ) , but does not affect the criterion for the generation of the multiphase gas due to thermal instabilities .",
    "we defer the study of these effects to future work .",
    "+      the intracluster medium emits radiation mainly in the x - ray band due to bremsstrahlung ( @xmath35 k ) and due to line emission at lower temperatures ( @xmath10  @xmath36 k ) . assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , the cooling source term in eq .",
    "( [ ene ] ) can be modeled with a cooling function @xmath37 : we use an analytical fit to the @xcite tabulated values for a fully ionized plasma with metallicity @xmath38 z@xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , setting the temperature floor at @xmath10 k. the total emissivity of the gas is also proportional to the electron and ion number densities : @xmath39 . for simplicity we assume that molecular weights are constant , with @xmath40 .",
    "an important difference between the current implementation of the cooling term and that adopted in our previous models ( g11a , b ; @xcite ) is the absence of the dropout term , which removes the cold gas from the domain .",
    "here we are interested in the formation and growth of thermal instabilities , producing cold clumps and filaments in the icm .",
    "the presence of the cooling term can significantly slow down the computation .",
    "explicit schemes , such as runge - kutta , are usually simple and fast ( per timestep ) , but impose severe restrictions on the timestep @xmath41 , making it much smaller than the regular hydrodynamical timestep .",
    "implicit schemes allow to use larger timesteps , but these methods are less precise . in a splitting framework ,",
    "i.e. , first solving the hydrodynamic pde and then the cooling source term ode ( assuming fixed density ) , no implicit or explicit solver is actually needed for the ode step .    the new temperature @xmath42 of a cell @xmath43 at time @xmath44 can be computed from the old temperature @xmath45 by exactly evaluating the following integral : @xmath46 a practical way to compute the integral is to split the integration interval into two parts : one from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and the other one from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , using an arbitrary reference value ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the temperature @xmath49 can be exactly computed if the reciprocal of the cooling function is analytically integrable .",
    "thus , we decompose the cooling function into a large number of piece - wise powerlaws in logarithmic temperature intervals @xmath55    and precompute at initialization the constants of integration for each interval . the integral in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) can be computed analytically using this powerlaw decomposition of the cooling function . the only effort in retrieving @xmath49 comes from finding the correct interval in which the argument of @xmath56 resides ( eq .  ( [ exact2 ] ) ) .    aside from being exact ( in the ode step ) , this method is faster than either explicit or implicit methods .",
    "the error from the piece - wise powerlaw approximation is negligible , because the number of the temperature intervals can be made very large ( matching the tabulated sutherland & dopita values ) , without large memory requirements .    in principle ,",
    "our solver does not require a timestep limiter for stability . however , the coupling between the hydrodynamics and source term integration is still approximate .",
    "thus we preferred to impose an upper limit on the cooling timestep ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we note that this did not dramatically increase the computational requirements . in order to further improve the coupling",
    ", we have also implemented a second order accurate temporal evolution in the splitting scheme , i.e. , we alternate the order of the integration of the hydrodynamical ( h ) and source terms ( s ) as follows : h - s - s - h .",
    "we have compared the explicit calculation , setting a strong limiter ( @xmath58 @xmath15 ) , with the ` exact ' cooling run and we obtained equivalent results ( at least in the regime of parameters relevant to this study and down to the scales comparable to few smallest resolution elements ) .",
    "+      the heating module consists of two key elements : computation of mass accretion onto the central supermassive black hole , and the energy injection via collimated bipolar outflows . the quantity of accreted material is estimated as the inflow through a spherical surface very near the center , @xmath59 pc .",
    "each cubical cell @xmath43 containing a piece @xmath60 of the spherical surface , contributes @xmath61 to the accretion rate only if the radial velocity @xmath62 is negative ( inflow ) . the accreted gas , @xmath63 ,",
    "is then removed from the corresponding zone .",
    "after computing the total mass accretion rate , we calculate the kinetic power of the bipolar outflows from @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the ( mechanical ) efficiency of the feedback , which is a free parameter of our model .",
    "we note that the actual accreted gas should be ideally calculated a few gravitational radii from the black hole .",
    "this would require an extreme dynamical range , which is currently not possible due to hardware limitations .",
    "however , we can simply absorb any uncertainty in the actual accretion rate into our efficiency parameter @xmath65 .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath66 of the gas entering our sink region falls into the black hole , the real efficiency would need to be rescaled to @xmath67 .",

    "both jets originate at the same interface along the positive and negative @xmath70-direction ( @xmath71 is the @xmath70-vector ) .",
    "the jet flux terms appear on the right hand side of equations ( [ cont ] ) , ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ ene ] ) .",
    "this method of including agn feedback appears to be slightly better than injecting quantities at zone centers , which may lead to artificial evacuation of the regions perpendicular to the jets .",
    "the integrated mass outflow rate , @xmath72 , is based on the conservation of momentum ( @xmath73 ) , leading to @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the subrelativistic outflow velocity fixed at @xmath76 km s@xmath6 .",

    "our choice of the outflow velocity gives reasonable values for the mass outflow rate of @xmath78 yr@xmath6 .",
    "notice that more massive ( and slower ) outflows tend to carve a more visible channel in the icm , while lighter ( and faster ) jets release most of their energy in the central region , producing strong shocks and big bubbles similar to x - ray data ( see g11a , b ) .",
    "we also implemented wobbling jets , with variable inclination ( @xmath79 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath80 ) . in these computations",

    "notice that the real comparison with x - ray observations must be based on emission - weighted temperatures : the pure mass - weighted @xmath148 profile would appear much more disturbed with higher central values .",
    "the electron number density profile ( @xmath122 ) , also linked to the x - ray emissivity , appears consistent with observational data , with a flatter gradient compared to the pure cf run .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7_6em3_phases_jet ] ( third column ) we show the radial profile of @xmath82 and its minimum as a function of time .",
    "although we discuss the relationship between @xmath82 and the presence of the multiphase gas in more detail in section 4 , here we briefly point out that whenever this timescale ratio falls below @xmath1 , thermal instabilities grow and cold gas clumps condense out of the hot phase .",
    "initially , the cold phase has a filamentary structure ; then it turns into small clumps which fall toward the center in about a free - fall time .    the sb@xmath149 map and the the two - dimensional snapshot of @xmath122 at 1.5 gyr , shown in figure [ fig:7_6em3_maps ] (",
    "first and second panel ) , corresponds to a moment when the ti - ratio falls below 10 .",
    "the jet outburst creates two cavities along the @xmath150direction , while at the same time the perturbations due to the jets seem to lead to the formation of dense cold blobs up to @xmath151 kpc away from the center .",
    "the presence of multiphase gas is also apparent in the @xmath152 phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7_6em3_maps ] , third panel ) , which displays two distinct diagonal islands occupied by the gas in the cluster core , with small variations away from pressure equilibrium .    because the agn heating is anisotropic close to the base of the jet and the cooling gas possesses small amount of angular momentum , the cold gas tends to accrete and condense more along the equatorial region . in a realistic situation",
    "this gas can not be entirely removed in a brief time ( as in s11 ) ; consequently , a cold rotationally - supported torus is formed , which provides most of the fuel for the agn .",
    "the fuel supply from the torus , or the torus itself , can be temporarily disturbed by agn outbursts , shocks , and the icm turbulence .",
    "the central accumulation of cold gas could be further reduced by including star formation .",
    "overall , the heating due to realistic agn jets , with mechanical efficiency @xmath153 , appears to reproduce the main properties of the observed clusters : quenching the cooling flows while preserving the cool cores for several gyr . at the same time",
    ", the model predicts the formation of the multiphase medium in the form of cold blobs and filaments while satisfying the observational constraints on the amount of cold gas ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now discuss a run for higher mechanical efficiency (    @xmath154 ) compared to the one considered in the previous section (    @xmath155 ) .",
    "we note that these values likely bracket the range of acceptable efficiency levels , as pointed out by previous computations ( g11a ; s11 ) and observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the same set of diagnostic plots as before and we only discuss the differences between these models . the results for @xmath154 are shown in figures [ fig:7_1em2_phases_jet ] and [ fig:7_1em2_maps ] , which are direct counterparts to figures [ fig:7_6em3_phases_jet ] and [ fig:7_6em3_maps ] , respectively .",
    "the increase in the mechanical efficiency of the jets leads to stronger outflows characterized by a slightly more peaked jet power distribution centered around @xmath156 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "because in the adopted feedback scheme @xmath157 is proportional to the jet power , the outflows also reach slightly higher mass loading rates ( @xmath158 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) .",
    "this means that some jet events carry larger amount of linear momentum and , thus , have more ` piercing power ' with which they plow through the icm .",
    "consequently , the jets release more of their energy at relatively larger distances from the cluster center , allowing a bit more cold gas accumulation along the equatorial region .",
    "the projected surface brightness map clearly shows the formation of a torus - like structure that was less pronounced in the lower efficiency run .",
    "the initial increase in the average cooling ( and accretion ) rate is strongly quenched at around 1 gyr since the beginning of the simulation , which is earlier than in the previous run .",
    "after this short phase , the system gradually settles to a quasi equilibrium state , with cooling rates around @xmath159 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , twice the level seen in the lower efficiency case .",
    "paradoxically , more powerful jets are less efficient in stopping the cooling flow , due to tunnel carving .",
    "the total injected energy is comparable in both runs ( @xmath137 erg ) , a sign that the self - regulation process is overall very similar , although with a slightly shorter active phase and a lower frequency of the outbursts ( see jet power cdf ) .",
    "the total cold gas mass ( @xmath160 @xmath5 ) is slightly larger than in the preceding case , but still only @xmath161 of the pure cooling flow value , which is consistent with the observational constraints . during the entire evolution of this simulation ,",
    "the outflows tend to produce bigger bubbles or a deeper channel ( see also the @xmath162 cut ) .",
    "the effect of more powerful jets is also to increase the scatter in the phase diagram : the gas in hot phase occupies a wider range of values in the @xmath163 plane about the ( imaginary ) diagonal line representing average pressure .",
    "the minimum ti - ratio falls below 10 only early in the evolution .",
    "extended cold gas , in the form of blobs and filaments , is mainly formed at that epoch ( see the @xmath162 cut ) . at later times ,",
    "more powerful events raise @xmath82 well over 10 , and the icm becomes hotter .",
    "even if the system settles later around a minimum ti - ratio of 13 , extended cold filaments may be occasionally seen at moderate radii due to dredge up of the cold torus by outflows .",
    "the uplift of the cold gas and the expansion of bubbles may further increase density , possibly triggering new thermal instabilities .",
    "this picture is also consistent with the observational analysis presented in m11 ( see their fig . 12 , right panel ) , suggesting that value 10 marks an approximate transition to the regime where the multiphase gas may appear .      to test the robustness of our results we included jet wobbling in the run with mechanical efficiency @xmath128 .",
    "observational data is consistent with the possibility that the jets may precess or their orientation may change . since the data is very limited ,",
    "we keep the model very simple and change jet orientation whenever the accreted mass reaches a threshold of @xmath36 @xmath5 . for typical mass accretion rate of order",
    "@xmath164 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , this corresponds to a reorientation timescale of @xmath151 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the first simulation with jet wobbling",
    ", we assumed that the probability of jet pointing in a given direction is given by a random uniform distribution over 4@xmath165 steradians ( the bipolar jets are always collinear ) .",
    "initially , the jet orientation changes at a slower rate , @xmath166 myr , because the accretion rate is relatively low .",
    "thus , in this early stage , the evolution is very similar to that for the non - wobbling case with efficiency of @xmath128 .",
    "however , the energy is better spatially distributed , and thus the cooling rate is more quenched , reaching values @xmath167 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 . as the accretion rate accelerates , and the jet orientation starts to change on timescales of 10 myr or less , the deposition of energy becomes nearly isotropic .",
    "a more uniform distribution of energy makes it more difficult to feed the black hole via the cold torus , which is now strongly disturbed . rather than being used to drill a channel through the icm",
    ", the agn jet is no longer able to efficiently deliver the energy to the icm beyond @xmath168 kpc .",
    "this enables the gas to cool rapidly at these radii , which leads to the cooling catastrophe in about 1 gyr .",
    "larger efficiencies could possibly stop the cooling , but the nearly isotropic centrally - concentrated energy distribution would destroy the cool core .    in order to remedy this situation , we considered models where the jet orientation is confined to two conical regions of half opening angle 75@xmath169 , 45@xmath169 , and 25@xmath169 .",
    "as before , the probability distribution of the jet orientations is randomly uniform within these regions . in the first two cases , the final result is similar to the case considered above , but",
    "the cooling flow is quenched for an additional time of @xmath170 gyr .",
    "for half opening angle of 25@xmath169 , the jet energy distribution becomes narrower and more anisotropic .",
    "apart from larger bubbles and a more frequent jet channel fragmentation , this computation resembles the previous best model r7 - 6em3 : the cooling rate is steady for several gyr ( @xmath171 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) , with total cold gas mass around @xmath172 @xmath5 .",
    "cold blobs are produced mainly in the first 1.5 gyr when ti - ratio oscillates around 10 . at later times",
    ", the system settles to a hotter state characterized by the ti - ratio of @xmath11315 - 16 .",
    "jet events are also more variable than in the r7 - 6em3 model , changing rapidly from @xmath173 to @xmath174 erg s@xmath6 , because more inclined outbursts are able to partially dismantle the central torus , temporarily inhibiting accretion .    in summary ,",
    "randomly wobbling jets with small and moderate opening angles produce similar results to unidirectional narrow outflows , especially for stopping the cooling flow catastrophe and generating extended multiphase gas .",
    "the other relevant feature is that the central accumulated cold torus can be frequently destroyed , depending on the wobbling parameters .",
    "+        in order to study the effect of feedback in slower cooling systems , we generated new initial hydrostatic conditions as follows .",
    "we decreased the central density preserving the initial profile slope at @xmath176 kpc ; simultaneously , we increased the central temperature to ensure that the icm remains in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the new initial conditions correspond to the minimum ti - ratio of @xmath177 .",
    "the new initial profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:21_6em3_phases_jet ] , black dashed lines ( third column ) .",
    "the entropy is elevated to 30 kev @xmath14 at 10 kpc  still within observational bounds ( @xcite )  while the total gas mass is decreased only by 8% .",
    "the results from the runs corresponding to these new initial conditions and agn mechanical efficiency of @xmath128 are shown in figures [ fig:21_6em3_phases_jet ] and [ fig:21_6em3_maps ] .",
    "these figures are analogous to those previously discussed .",
    "overall , the behavior of the system is quite similar to what we observed before .",
    "the model is successful in predicting a globally stable icm core , low cooling rates ( @xmath178 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 , 10% of pure cf ) , preservation of the cool core ( e.g. , entropy , sb@xmath149 ) , typical features of agn jets ( bubbles , shocks , turbulence ) , and the amount of multiphase medium consistent with observations .",
    "the main result is that the local thermal instability is triggered despite the fact that the _ initial _ minimum ti - ratio exceeds @xmath151 .",
    "it is only when the instantaneous value of this ratio falls below the critical threshold of @xmath151 that the multiphase medium suddenly appears in the simulation ( e.g. , after 1 gyr ) .",
    "as before , this leads to increased feedback that brings the system back to the high ti - ratio regime , which in this case is well above @xmath179 and higher than in the previously considered systems .",
    "even if the typical jet power ( few @xmath144 erg s@xmath6 ) and total injected energy ( @xmath180 erg ; single jet ) are lower compared to r7 - 6em3 , the agn outflows have a relatively stronger impact on the lighter icm , secularly increasing the ti - ratio back above 20 . as a consequence ,",
    "spatially concentrated cooling , in the form of a rotating torus , is present during the entire evolution . in section 4",
    "we make an in - depth comparison between the models with different initial @xmath82 ratio .",
    "the total cold gas mass in the model discussed above reaches @xmath160 @xmath5 , which is higher than r7 - 6em3 .",
    "although this is observationally acceptable , some systems show smaller amounts of cold gas mass .",
    "therefore , we experimented with increasing the mechanical efficiency in order to decrease the amount of cold gas ( figures not shown ) .",
    "however , as argued in sec .",
    "3.2.2 , higher efficiencies lead to stronger and more mass - loaded jets that deposit their mechanical energy farther away from the center . if in the initial outbursts the system appears to be more heated due to shocks , the situation reverses later , when the jet carves a deeper channel in the icm .",
    "thus , more accretion occurs along the equator and a strong cooling flow develops .",
    "as seen before , this feature could be alleviated by a randomly wobbling outflow , with a less anisotropic energy deposition .",
    "overall , the simulations with higher minimum initial ti - ratio 21 , can again produce extended multiphase gas whenever the instantaneous @xmath82 falls @xmath167 .",
    "in fact , in the early phase of the evolution , when cooling slightly prevails over heating , the ti - ratio slowly decreases , crossing the threshold in about a gyr . later , stronger outbursts set the system back to a hotter state and higher ti - ratio , until the cycle restarts again ( it may require several gyr ) .",
    "the main trend for the entire 5 gyr is therefore concentrated cooling occurring in the core .",
    "contrary to the more massive models ( ti - ratio 7 ) , the right efficiencies in order to quench the cooling flow and preserve the cool core should not be more than @xmath83 . a less massive system is in fact more susceptible to mechanical outbursts , and requires a more delicate feedback , in analogy to the environment of galaxy groups or ellipticals , as has been shown in previous works ( g11b , s11 ) .",
    "galaxy clusters are extremely important astrophysical objects . lying on the exponential tail of the halo mass distribution",
    ", they provide a sensitive probe of cosmology .",
    "they are also home to the most massive galaxies and black holes in the universe .",
    "galaxy clusters are observed in all wavebands , from radio to x - ray and gamma rays .",
    "owing to their deep potential wells , they are almost closed systems with the baryon fraction similar to the universal value .",
    "moreover , most of the baryons in clusters are in the form of hot x - ray emitting plasma , the intracluster medium . understanding the state of the icm will not only make clusters more useful cosmological probes , but also shed light on galaxy formation and on the state of most of the baryons in the universe .",
    "in this paper we try to understand the thermal state of the icm core , closely tying our models with observations . from multiwavelength observations",
    "it is clear that the dense plasma with short cooling times in cluster cores is not cooling in a catastrophic fashion . what is the mechanism at the base of such self - preservation behavior ?",
    "radio bubbles and x - ray cavities associated with cool - core clusters suggest that the active galactic nucleus acts as a thermostat , fueled by the cooling gas . as argued by g11a , the best realistic model able to maintain quasi thermal equilibrium for several gyr , i.e.",
    ", quenching the cooling flow without destroying the cool - core structure , is an asymmetrical input of mechanical energy , in the form of massive outflows . the cooling flow solution ( sec .",

    "mass accretion and cooling rates in our best feedback simulations ( sec .",

    "the x - ray surface brightness is also not strongly peaked in the center ; the entropy and emission - weighted temperatures do not rapidly decline under the initial values , conserving the positive gradient . using mechanical efficiencies in the range @xmath182 , the typical outflow powers are @xmath183 erg s@xmath6 , comparable to the x - ray luminosity",
    ".    the fundamental result , consistent with observations , is that extended cold filaments and blobs condense out of the hot phase whenever @xmath184 or , equivalently , when the central entropy becomes @xmath185 kev @xmath14 .",
    "the cold clumps fall then toward the center in about a free - fall time , forming a central cold rotating torus and in part boosting the black hole accretion rate .",
    "the formation of cold filaments is a result of interplay between thermal instability and gravity .",
    "previous idealized analyses by m11 and s11 enforced strict thermal equilibrium and found that multiphase gas is generated according to the same threshold ) because instabilities are amplified by geometrical compression , as blobs sink toward the center . ] .",
    "a realistic feedback displays a variegated self - regulated evolution , producing complex observed phenomena , which are not captured by simple idealized prescriptions . in the present work , we tested bipolar agn jets , tied to the mass accretion rate at very small radii .",
    "the asymmetrical input of energy produces strong elliptical shocks and regularly inflates hot bubbles , which rise outwards . at the same time",
    "the inflow is not entirely stopped : along the equatorial direction the gas , mainly cold , continues to fuel the black hole .",
    "turbulence , entrainment and mixing dissipate the directional kinetic energy of the jets , further inhibiting the cooling flow near the center .",
    "when the jet ram pressure is substantial , the cold gas is also dredged up , as observed in a few cases such as perseus and hydra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cycle repeats , when cooling starts to dominate again and the cold gas condensation ignites more powerful outbursts , setting the system in a slightly hotter state .",
    "overall , thermal equilibrium is only roughly maintained , on large spatial and temporal scales .",
    "for example , the two maps in figure [ fig : te ] , for best model r7 - 6em3 , display the net thermal energy increase ( red ) or decrement ( blue ) per volume and time .",
    "the internal energy equation is given by @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the internal energy density ( erg @xmath188 ) .",
    "the maps indicate that ` heating ' ( @xmath189 ) and ` cooling ' ( @xmath190 ) alternate on scales of a few kpc .",
    "averages of @xmath191 in radial shells of width @xmath192 kpc suggest that a rough thermal equilibrium is maintained , although cooling appears slightly dominant in the central 10 kpc , while the jets tend to deposit their energy at larger radii .",
    "equation ( [ etherm ] ) does not , however , fully capture the irreversible heating associated with turbulent mixing , shocks and , wave damping due to numerical effects .",
    "a better direct indicator of the balance between cooling ( @xmath193 ) and heating ( @xmath194 ) is the variation of the entropy @xmath195 ( @xmath196 , where @xmath197 ) , which is insensitive to adiabatic compressions or expansions : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the lagrangian derivative .",
    "the right panels in figure 9 show the time variations in radial shells of the ` astrophysical ' entropy @xmath200 for the whole icm , with respect to the initial value @xmath201 .",
    "as expected the entropy increases on a secular timescale due the continuous action of the agn feedback . on smaller temporal scales ,",
    "e.g. , a few typical cooling times ( @xmath202 myr ) , the amplitude of the fluctuations in the six thick spherical shells ( centered at @xmath203 , 18 , 14 , 10 , 6 and 2 kpc ; shown from the top to bottom row , respectively ) can reach 2 or 3 times the mean value , especially in the nuclear region . although the fluctuations in @xmath200 can be substantial , its mean saturates at a stable level .",
    "this suggests that the cluster core does not _ dramatically _ deviate from the state of ( quasi ) equilibrium between cooling and heating , at least on scales of tens kpc and hundreds of myr .",
    "this was also suggested by the low cooling / accretion rates compared to a pure cooling flow .",
    "the assumption of strict global thermal equilibrium made in the work of m11 and s11 is therefore very idealized .",
    "it is thus particularly remarkable that our criterion for the formation of the multiphase gas is in good agreement with their result .    unlike in s11 , the central kpc region",
    "is not excised , allowing the cold gas ( either nuclear cooling or fallen blobs ) to form an angular momentum - supported torus as observed in the core of m87 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a disk can be partially dismantled when the jet direction is perturbed by turbulence or by random jet precession ( sec .",
    "nevertheless , the central dense disk is a common feature among elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "centrally concentrated atomic gas is also seen in the survey of @xcite .",
    "the central disk is certainly a nursery for new stars . since the star formation efficiency is quite uncertain ( few per cent , up to 50% , with an average value of @xmath204 , according to @xcite ) we decided to not model star formation via a sink term .",
    "thus , the central accumulation of cold gas could be further reduced .",
    "the presence of multiphase gas is clearly seen in the @xmath152 joint distributions .",
    "the cold dense phase ( @xmath205 k ) , in the upper left corner , is present in large quantities and detached from the hot rarefied gas ( @xmath206 few @xmath36 k ) , with a lack of gas at intermediate temperatures . a recent h@xmath2 survey ( @xcite ) has shown that extended cold filaments are found in @xmath207 of all clusters .",
    "it is striking that some of their maps ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) resemble our computed morphologies , with extended blobs and filaments up to @xmath132 kpc : e.g. , abell 0496 , hydra a , abell 1644 , sersic 159 - 03 , and abell 1795 ( the cluster on which our model is based ) .",
    "another case with substantial extended h@xmath2 emission is the perseus cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the total cold gas mass we obtain , @xmath130 @xmath5 , is consistent with the constraints of @xcite , whose observations indicate clusters harboring up to @xmath208 @xmath5 of molecular gas .",
    "the white noise perturbations in the initial conditions are wiped out over a cooling time .",
    "in fact , in the pure cooling flow computation , multiphase gas is only possible in such restricted interval , while the secular evolution is dominated by monolithic cooling . on the contrary , agn feedback drives and sustains the fluctuations in the long term evolution , although the original seeds initially help to distribute better the jet energy due to the interaction of jet with the inhomogeneous icm .",
    "the thermal state of the cluster core depends mainly on the feedback efficiency : with smaller @xmath65 the frequency of cold filaments condensing out of the hot phase is larger ( figs . 3 , 5 , 7 )",
    ". nevertheless , higher initial @xmath82 ( and lower density ) generates extended multiphase gas according to the ti criterion , but thermal equilibrium is reached at later epochs . it is interesting to note that agn feedback is more effective in lighter systems , requiring therefore lower efficiencies ( @xmath209 ) , as has been shown for galaxy groups ( g11b , s11 ) .",

    "the points are color coded according to time : from blue ( early ) to red ( late ) . for the run with the initial @xmath127 ( upper panel ) ,",
    "the cold gas is much more spatially extended , especially in the first 2 gyr .",
    "the run with less dense initial conditions ( ti - ratio 21 ) shows a lower frequency of cold blobs at large distances because @xmath212 most of the time ( compare figs . 3 and 7 ) . in both cases , the points clustered around @xmath213 kpc correspond to the rotating cold torus .",
    "since this plot shows the current average distance rather than the radius where the cold gas originates , extended filaments appear even when ti - ratio is elevated to @xmath214 due to agn heating .",
    "this tendency is further enhanced if cold blobs are dredged up by powerful outflowing jets . moreover , as the ti - ratio is averaged in spherical shells , a few cold zones may contribute to @xmath210 , without changing much the average @xmath82 .",
    "that is , some extended h@xmath2 emission is consistent with @xmath82 slightly greater than 10 .",
    "figure [ fig : rcold_time ] displays @xmath210 gas as a function of time . with denser initial conditions ( r7 - 6em3 ) , @xmath82 is less than 10 for several short intervals within 2 gyr and we expect extended cold gas is boosted exactly during this period ( see fig .  [ fig:7_6em3_phases_jet ] ) . ] .",
    "indeed , the average distance of the cold gas is significantly larger than that of the cold torus ( @xmath215 kpc ) during this period .",
    "similarly , for the lower initial density run we see extended cold filaments at @xmath216 gyr , again when @xmath184 ; later times are however dominated by the nuclear cold gas .",
    "we conclude that the instantaneous value of @xmath82 is a robust indicator of extended cold gas formation , while nuclear cold gas can be present irrespective of the ti - ratio ( e.g. , bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcold_ratio ] ) .",
    "it is likely that other physical processes play an important role in shaping the morphology of condensing multiphase gas . @xcite and m11 showed that anisotropic thermal conduction leads to cold gas stretched along the local magnetic field direction . in order to be able to fully understand the exact topology of cold filaments , this physics should be included in the simulations ( with an adequately higher resolution ) .",
    "however , the generation of cold filaments , whenever @xmath184 , is not likely to be affected by the presence of anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "the other physics that is missing in our simulations involves cosmological accretion and mergers , which drive additional turbulence , inducing more instabilities .",
    "like agn feedback , major mergers are associated with entropy generation and strong heating of cluster cores , raising the cooling time over the cluster age .",
    "thus , mergers may be responsible for extreme non - cool - core clusters .",
    "however , they are also rare with timescales much longer than the cluster core cooling times ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , agn feedback , rather than mergers , is expected to be responsible for balancing cooling in most systems .",
    "our theoretical models are able to solve the cooling flow problem for several gyr .",
    "the key factor resides in adopting realistic mechanical agn jets .",
    "the bulk of agn heating is in fact a combination of shock dissipation and gradual thermalization of the mechanical energy ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "random motions , either due to agn , multiphase gas , and cosmological turbulence , strongly help the deposition of the feedback energy in the cool core , in contrast to idealized symmetric atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important issue is whether our results depend sensitively on resolution .",
    "the morphology of the cold phase depends on the resolution .",
    "we note that finite resolution may prevent the disruption and mixing of the small infalling clouds with the ambient icm .",
    "thus , limited resolution could in fact mimic some of the effects of the physics that we do not include ( e.g. , magnetic draping ) .",
    "we performed a test with two times lower resolution , but with the same resolution in the jet injection region ( r7 - 6em3c ) , and obtained very similar results . in particular ,",
    "a steady global thermal equilibrium is reached in a few gyr , with only a slightly larger final cold mass ( @xmath160 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the evolution of the ti - ratio and condensed cold blobs appears also similar to the higher resolution model ( r7 - 6em3 ) , although the increased numerical dissipation tend to slow down the growth of thermal instabilities at larger radii .",
    "we note also that our simulations    have a resolution @xmath217 times higher compared to the work done in g11a .",
    "although in g11a we adopted a cold mass dropout and a different jet injection method , agn jets could also stop the cooling flow , in line with observations .",
    "long term thermalization seems therefore not dramatically affected by resolution or the exact heating prescription .",
    "the fine details of the feedback can however change with higher resolution , e.g. , jets tend to become more frequent ( cf .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * mechanical agn feedback self - consistently linked to bh accretion ( with efficiency @xmath182 ) , can solve the cooling flow problem , quenching the cooling rate down to @xmath151 @xmath5 yr@xmath6 ( 1 - 10% of the pure cooling flow value ) , preserving the cool core structure in agreement with observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical outflow powers are @xmath218 erg s@xmath6 , with velocities @xmath219 km s@xmath6 and mass loading rates @xmath220 yr@xmath6 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "best models are associated with narrow jets with fixed inclinations or fast random wobbling with half - opening angle @xmath221 . +",
    "* multiphase gas , with cold ( @xmath222 k ) and hot ( @xmath223 k ) components , is a direct consequence and source of feedback .",
    "the cold gas comes in two phases : extended phase ( up to 10 - 20 kpc of distance form the center ) in the form of blobs and filaments generated by thermal instabilities ( and occasionally due to dredge - up by jet ram pressure ) and a more spatially concentrated one in the form of central rotating torus due to nuclear cooling or accumulated fallen blobs .",
    "the h@xmath2 survey of @xcite shows both kinds of h@xmath2 emitting gas .",
    "nuclear cold reservoirs of gas , especially in the form of rotating disks are also a common feature among ellipticals ( @xcite ; a star formation sink term and jet wobbling can reduce it considerably though ) .",
    "total cold gas masses are @xmath130 @xmath5 after 5 gyr , within the observational constraints ( @xmath224 @xmath5 , @xcite ) .",
    "+ * the generation of extended cold gas is dictated by an important threshold : whenever the instantaneous ratio of the cooling time to the free - fall time is @xmath225 thermal instabilities lead to cold gas condensing out of the hot icm at large radii .",
    "on the contrary , when @xmath226 , slow runaway cooling occurs only within the central few kpc .",
    "this threshold seems to be surprisingly robust , as predicted by simple analytical arguments ( m11 ) and simulations with idealized feedback ( s11 ) .",
    "the criterion is also supported by recent observations ( fig .",
    "12 in m11 ; @xcite ) . +",
    "* multiphase icm can exist in cool - core clusters irrespectively of their initial minimum @xmath82 . with a realistic feedback the cluster core always finds a way to self - regulate toward a state of global _ quasi _ thermal equilibrium on large spatial and temporal scales .",
    "the system forgets about the initial state in a few cooling times and the eventual evolution depends primarily on the feedback efficiency .",
    "lower @xmath65 results in frequent episodes of extended cold gas .",
    "intense cooling episodes are followed by increased jet activity and the core returns to a higher entropy level .",
    "this phase is more prolonged and intense in less massive systems ( e.g. , initial @xmath175 ) .",
    "the reduced gas inflow leads to the decreasing jet power , allowing a slow spatially concentrated cooling to start again ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "+    overall , the main thermal properties of cluster cores are determined by global quasi - thermal equilibrium , with an amazingly detailed complexity of cold filaments / torus , jets , bubbles and shocks .",
    "additional processes , such as thermal conduction , magnetic fields and cosmological accretion , are required to make more precise comparisons with observations .",
    "nevertheless , we showed that multiphase gas due to thermal instabilities is an essential element of the feedback cycle : end product of cooling and fuel for the central black hole .",

    "<S> when this happens , dense cold gas decouples from the hot icm phase and generates inhomogeneous and spatially extended h@xmath2 filaments . </S>",
    "<S> these cold gas clumps and filaments ` rain ' down onto the central regions of the core , forming a cold rotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the self - regulated feedback enhances agn heating and the core returns to a higher entropy level with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> eventually the core reaches quasi - stable global thermal equilibrium , and cold filaments condense out of the hot icm whenever @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs despite the fact that the energy from agn jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the turbulent motions in the wake of freely - falling cold filaments . </S>",
    "<S> increased agn activity can locally reverse the cold gas flow , launching cold filamentary gas away from the cluster center . </S>",
