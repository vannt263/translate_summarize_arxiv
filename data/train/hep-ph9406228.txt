    "we first concentrate on the channel @xmath34 because it is relatively simple in the sense that the @xmath31 pair must come from the longitudinal @xmath0-boson scattering while the final state @xmath0 bosons are the spectators .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to implement the acceptance cuts on the strongly - scattered @xmath40 bosons and on the spectator @xmath0 bosons , separately .",
    "however , for the channel @xmath41 it is more complicated to implement the kinematic cuts because it is ambiguous to determine which @xmath0 bosons come out from the strong scattering region and which @xmath0 bosons are the spectators .",

    "thanks to some intensive studies of longitudinal vector boson scattering at hadronic supercolliders @xcite , we can borrow their strategies .",
    "the strongly - scattered @xmath48 bosons should have larger transverse momentum and larger invariant mass @xmath28 in the central rapidity region than the @xmath40 bosons from the background ; while the spectator @xmath0 bosons , coming from the photon splitting , tend to be in the forward rapidity region . therefore , we begin with the acceptance cuts @xmath49 on the strongly - scattered @xmath31 pair , and the basic acceptance to tag both spectator @xmath0 bosons : @xmath50 these spectator @xmath0 bosons have to be tagged in order to eliminate the @xmath33 or @xmath29 backgrounds .",

    "@xcite , the signal for the like - charge channels is substantially smaller than the signal for the opposite - charge channel .",
    "the dominance of the opposite - charge channel over the like - charge channels is due to the presence of a s - channel resonance in the opposite - charge channel and the absence of any doubly - charged resonance in the like - charge channels .",
    "therefore , for the following we only concentrate on the opposite - charge scattering channel .    since we are going to impose very different acceptance cuts on the strongly - scattered @xmath0 bosons and the spectator @xmath0 bosons , we have to distinguish them .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we reorder the absolute rapidities of the @xmath0 bosons according to @xmath64 .",
    "we then assume the first two @xmath0 bosons with smallest absolute rapidities to be the strongly - scattered @xmath0 bosons as we expect them to be central ; while the last two @xmath0 bosons with largest absolute rapidities to be the spectators as we expect them to be forward .",

    "in the extreme case of no light resonance ( nonresonant model ) , unitarity is likely to be saturated before reaching the lightest resonance .",

    "once @xmath147 is chosen , everything is fixed .",
    "the luminosity function is folded with the subprocess cross sections as follows : @xmath148 to obtain the cross sections for the signal at the center - of - mass energy @xmath149 of the parent @xmath15 collider ; while the cross section for the sm background is @xmath150 the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ summary2](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , for the @xmath151 and @xmath4 as a function of the center - of - mass energies of the parent @xmath15 collider .",
    "we have multiplied to the signal curves a constant 79% tagging efficiency to represent the effect of tagging the spectator @xmath0 bosons , and the background curves are calculated exactly with all the acceptance cuts . the shape and the relative size of the signal and background curves do not change significantly from figs .",
    "[ summary1 ] to figs .",
    "[ summary2 ] , in which the photon spectrum is folded .",
    "however , the actual values of the cross sections drop substantially , indicating that the monochromaticity of the photon beams is very important .",
    "this is easy to understand that the cross section of the signal increases quite sharply with @xmath119 , as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ summary1 ] , and therefore the middle to lower end of the photon spectrum by laser backscattering can hardly contribute to the strong ewsb signal .",
    "since only the upper end of the photon spectrum can contribute to the signal , it is necessary to use polarized laser and electron beams to increase the monochromaticity of the colliding photon beams @xcite .",
    "if the monochromaticity of the photon beam can approach the limit of being perfect about 0.8 of the parent electron - beam energy , an @xmath15 machine of 2.5 tev would be sufficient to be converted into a 2 tev photon collider , which has been concluded , in the last section , feasible to probe the strong ewsb scenario .",
    "we will not comment any more on what energy of an @xmath15 collider operating in the @xmath17 mode is enough to probe the ewsb sector , but only emphasize that @xmath47 tev with a luminosity of 10  fb@xmath7 is sufficient .",
    "we have presented a signal - background analysis for studying the strong @xmath83 scattering at @xmath17 colliders .",
    "we confront the signal of various strong ewsb models against the worst irreducible background from the sm production of @xmath34 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have demonstrated , with the analysis on the vector - boson level , that with our acceptance cuts the background can be substantially reduced to a level smaller than the signal , and the signal still maintains a very high significance with 10 fb@xmath7 luminosity . in principle , a complete monte carlo simulation including the decays of the @xmath111 bosons , the smearing of the momentum of the decay products , and the true detector acceptance is needed to establish the viability .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown , as a first step , that it is very feasible to probe the ewsb by studying the longitudinal @xmath0-boson scattering ( fig.[scheme ] ) at photon colliders , provided that the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath17 system is of the order 2 tev with a luminosity of just 10  fb@xmath7 , or provided that the center - of - mass energy is 1.5 tev but with a high luminosity of the order 100  fb@xmath7 .",
