    "<S> inflation naturally gives the origin of primordial curvature perturbation , which is the seed of all the observed rich structure of the present universe .    in the inflationary universe scenario , </S>",
    "<S> there are two main possibilities as a source of the curvature perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> one is the inflaton : the quantum fluctuation of the scalar field which causes inflationary expansion can be the origin of the primordial curvature perturbation . in the curvaton scenario , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the curvature perturbation is generated by the quantum fluctuation of a light scalar field other than the inflaton , called curvaton  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the curvaton is assumed to have a negligible energy fraction during inflation , but later it tends to ( nearly ) dominate the energy density of the universe before it decays into radiation . </S>",
    "<S> currently the curvaton scenario is still viable in light of the planck result .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the characteristic features of the curvaton scenario is that it can produce large non - gaussianity , often parameterized by @xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the curvaton energy density is subdominant at the decay , @xmath0 is enhanced as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is roughly the energy fraction of the curvaton at the decay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the planck constraint reads @xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus if the curvaton scenario is true , the curvaton energy fraction @xmath3 can not be so small in order to avoid too large non - gaussianity .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that this naive expectation breaks down in a very simple and natural curvaton model . </S>",
    "<S> actually the local type non - gaussianity can naturally be suppressed so that @xmath0 can be at most @xmath5 independently of the curvaton energy fraction . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , any non - linearity parameter related to higher order statistics , such as @xmath6 , can also be at most @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a sufficient condition is that the curvaton begins to oscillate in the quartic potential in the inflaton - oscillation dominated era and decays when the potential is dominated by the quadratic one . </S>",
    "<S> + let us consider the curvaton with the canonical kinetic term and the following potential @xmath7 with @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> the cosmological scenario is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the curvaton @xmath10 is placed at @xmath11 @xmath12 during inflation , where @xmath13 , and begins to oscillate at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter , during the inflaton oscillation dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> after that , the amplitude of the coherent oscillation , @xmath16 , decreases as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the scale factor of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> then the curvaton potential becomes dominated by the quadratic one around @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> inflaton decays at @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the inflaton decay rate , after that the radiation dominated era begins . at this stage , we assume that the curvaton energy density is still negligible compared with that of radiation . finally , the curvaton decays at @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the curvaton decay width and the dominant curvature perturbation is generated . </S>",
    "<S> the following results do not depend on whether @xmath24 or @xmath25 , but hereafter we assume @xmath24 for concreteness .    here it should be noticed that there are three sources of curvature perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> one is the fluctuation of @xmath26 itself , another is the modulation of the oscillation epoch @xmath27 due to the @xmath28 term in the potential  @xcite and the other is the modulation of @xmath29  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this last contribution is crucial for the discussion below and this effect has been neglected in the most previous literatures .    </S>",
    "<S> we make use of the @xmath30 formalism to calculate the non - linear curvature perturbation @xmath31  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the e - folding number between the final uniform density slice and the initial spatially flat slice , and @xmath34 is that of the background value . </S>",
    "<S> we take the final uniform density slice to be the curvaton decay surface : @xmath35 . on our purpose </S>",
    "<S> , the initial slice can be taken at arbitrary time as long as the curvaton energy density is negligible and the curvaton is the only source of the curvature perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> hence we take it to be the reheating surface @xmath36 just for simplicity .    </S>",
    "<S> the curvaton energy density at @xmath36 is evaluated as @xmath37 note that @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is schematically rewritten as @xmath41 therefore , the curvaton energy density at its decay @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the scale factor at the inflaton decay and the curvaton decay , respectively , and @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , radiation energy density at the curvaton decay is evaluated as @xmath47 here it should be noticed that @xmath48 does not depend on @xmath49 because of the assumption that the curvaton energy density is negligible at the inflaton decay .    </S>",
    "<S> then we have the following condition at the curvaton decay surface  @xcite : @xmath50 by differentiating this equation with respect to @xmath11 , we obtain @xmath51 where the superscript @xmath52 means the @xmath53-th derivative with respect to @xmath11 . by noting @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the hubble scale during inflation . </S>",

    "<S> an interesting situation appears in the case of @xmath63 or @xmath64 . or @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the curvature perturbation vanishes at the non - linear level as is clear from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> this is because the modulation of the oscillation epoch , encoded in @xmath27 , cancels the fluctuation of @xmath66  @xcite . ] note that the quartic term arises as a coleman - weinberg correction  @xcite if @xmath10 couples to another scalar field @xmath67 as @xmath68 . in this case </S>",

    "<S> actually we can formally show that all the non - linearity parameters of the form @xmath73 do not contain terms with negative powers of @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> this should be contrasted to the ordinary curvaton model in which @xmath76 , corresponding to @xmath77 ( or @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the curvature perturbation is roughly given by the fluctuation of the curvaton energy density , @xmath78 with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this second term was a source of large non - gaussianity : @xmath2 for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> in our case , for @xmath64 , this second term does not exist since @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> all the non - linearity arises from the small @xmath11 dependence of @xmath75 , which however does not generate non - gaussianity enhanced with negative powers of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> +     as a function of @xmath71 for the potential ( [ pot ] ) with @xmath63 ( blue solid ) . for comparison , @xmath0 with simple quadratic potential ( @xmath82 , red dashed ) </S>",

    "<S> actually , with this set up , the curvaton starts to oscillate and the effective potential is shifted to the quadratic one in the inflaton dominated era . by varying @xmath23 , we scan wide range of @xmath3 . then we evaluate the e - folding number from the initial time to the uniform hubble slice , taken well after the curvaton decay , for various initial condition @xmath11 , to obtain @xmath90 and @xmath91 . it is seen that even for small @xmath3 , @xmath0 remains almost constant of @xmath5 as expected . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , we have also shown numerical result of @xmath0 for the simple quadratic potential @xmath92 by the red dashed line , which shows the enhancement like @xmath2 for small @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> + so far we have assumed that the curvaton begins to oscillate in the inflaton - oscillation dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> if the curvaton begins to oscillate in the radiation dominated era after the reheating , we obtain similar results except that @xmath93 is replaced by @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the non - gaussianity is suppressed for @xmath95 , as studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the curvature perturbation vanishes for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> + to summarize , we have shown that the local type non - gaussianity can naturally be suppressed in a simple curvaton model like ( [ pot ] ) with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> if the curvaton potential is initially dominated by @xmath97 term and begins to oscillate in the inflaton - dominated era , all the non - linearity parameters do not contain terms proportional to negative powers of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it says that the curvaton non - gaussianity can not be large even in the simplest setup , contrary to the common wisdom . </S>",
    "<S> if the curvaton potential contains more than two polynomials , results would be more complicated . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , calculations of non - linearity parameters in various curvaton potentials and cosmological evolution scenarios may need to be reexamined , in particular taking the effect of modulation of @xmath29 into account . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in some cases , as studied in this letter , it happens that @xmath0 can not have enhancement like @xmath98 or even the curvature perturbation itself vanishes . </S>"
