    "black holes present us with a very deep paradox . the path to resolving this paradox",
    "may well be the path to a consistent unified theory of matter and quantized gravity .    in classical gravity ,",
    "a black hole is a classical solution of the equations of motion such that there is a region of spacetime that is causally disconnected from asymptotic infinity ( see e.g.  reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary of such a region is called the event horizon .",
    "consider a large collection of low - density matter , in an asymptotically flat spacetime . for simplicity , we take the starting configuration to be spherically symmetric and nonrotating ( these restrictions do not affect the nature of the paradox that emerges )",
    ". this ball of matter will collapse toward smaller radii under its self - gravitation . at some point",
    ", the matter will pass through a critical radius , the schwarzschild radius @xmath0 , after which its further collapse can not be halted , whatever the equation of state .",
    "the final result , in classical general relativity , is that the matter ends up in an infinite - density singular point , while the metric settles down to the schwarzschild form @xmath1 here @xmath2 is newton s constant of gravity , and @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "the horizon radius of this hole is @xmath4 where the last expression arises after we set @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "( in what follows , we adopt these units unless otherwise explicitly indicated ; we also set @xmath7 . )",
    "classically , nothing can emerge from inside the horizon to the outside .",
    "a test mass @xmath8 has effective energy zero if it is placed at the horizon ; it has rest energy @xmath9 , but a negative gravitational potential energy exactly balances this positive contribution . for a rough estimate of the horizon size , we may put this negative energy to be the newtonian value @xmath10 , for which @xmath11 .",
    "it may appear from the above that the gravitational fields at the horizon of a black hole are very large .",
    "this is not true . for a neutral black hole of mass @xmath12 ,",
    "the magnitude of the curvature invariants , which are the measure of local gravitational forces , is given by | r| ~g_n m r^3 .",
    "thus , at the horizon @xmath13 , the curvature scales as @xmath14 . as a result , for black holes with masses @xmath15 ,",
    "the curvatures are very small and the spacetime is locally rather close to flat spacetime .",
    "in fact , an object falling into a black hole will not experience any strong force as it crosses the horizon",
    ". however , an asymptotic observer watching this object will see that it takes an infinite time to reach the horizon .",
    "this is because there is an infinite gravitational red - shift between the horizon and the asymptotic region .",
    "an important point about black hole formation is that one does not need to crush matter to high densities to form a black hole .",
    "in fact , if the hole has mass @xmath12 , the order of magnitude of the density required of the matter is @xmath16 thus , a black hole of the kind believed to exist at the center of our galaxy ( @xmath17 solar masses ) could form from a ball with the density of water .",
    "in fact , given any density we choose , we can make a black hole if we take a sufficient total mass with that density .",
    "this fact makes it very hard to imagine a theory in which black holes do not form at all because of some feature of the interaction between the matter particles . as a consequence , if black holes lead to a paradox , it is hard to bypass the paradox by doing away with black holes in the theory .",
    "it is now fairly widely believed that black holes exist in nature .",
    "solar - mass black holes can be endpoints of stellar evolution , and supermassive black holes ( @xmath18 solar masses ) probably exist at the centers of galaxies . in some situations , these holes accrete matter from their surroundings , and the collisions among these infalling particles create very powerful sources of radiation that are believed to be the source of the high - energy output of quasars . in this article , however , we are not concerned with any of these astrophysical issues .",
    "we concentrate instead on the quantum properties of isolated black holes , with a view toward understanding the problems that arise as issues of principle when quantum mechanical ideas are put in the context of black holes .",
    "for example , the hawking radiation process discussed below is a quantum process that is much weaker than the radiation from the infalling matter mentioned above , and it would be almost impossible to measure even by itself .",
    "( the one possible exception is the hawking radiation at the last stage of quantum evaporation .",
    "this radiation emerges in a sharp burst with a universal profile , and there are experiments under way to look for such radiation from very small primordial black holes . )      already , at this stage , one finds what may be called the entropy problem .",
    "one of the most time - honored laws in physics has been the second law of thermodynamics , which states that the entropy of matter in the universe can not decrease .",
    "but with a black hole present in the universe , one can imagine the following process .",
    "a box containing some gas , which has a certain entropy , is dropped into a large black hole .",
    "the metric of the black hole then soon settles down to the schwarzschild form above , though with a larger value for @xmath12 , the black hole mass .",
    "the entropy of the gas has vanished from view , so that if we only count the entropy that we can explicitly see , then the second law of thermodynamics has been violated !",
    "this violation of the second law can be avoided if one associates an entropy to the black hole itself . starting with the work of bekenstein @xcite , we now know that if we associate an entropy @xmath19 with the black hole of horizon area @xmath20 , then in any gedanken experiment in which we try to lose entropy down the hole , the increase in the black hole s attributed entropy is such that @xmath21 ( for an analysis of such gedanken experiments , see e.g.  @xcite ) . furthermore , an `` area theorem '' in general relativity states that in any classical process , the total area of all black holes can not decrease .",
    "this statement is rather reminiscent of the statement of the second law of thermodynamics  the entropy of the entire universe can never decrease .    thus the proposal ( equation [ eq : two ] )",
    "would appear to be a nice one , but now we encounter the following problem .",
    "we would also like to believe on general grounds that thermodynamics can be understood in terms of statistical mechanics ; in particular , the entropy @xmath22 of any system is given by s = log   , [ eq : none ] where @xmath23 denotes the number of states of the system for a given value of the macroscopic parameters .",
    "for a black hole of one solar mass , this implies that there should be @xmath24 states !",
    "but the metric ( equation [ eq : one ] ) of the hole suggests a unique state for the geometry of the configuration .",
    "if one tries to consider small fluctuations around this metric , or adds in , say , a scalar field in the vicinity of the horizon , then the extra fields soon flow off to infinity or fall into the hole , and the metric again settles down to the form of equation  [ eq : one ] .",
    "if the black hole has a unique state , then the entropy should be @xmath25 , which is not what we expected from equation  [ eq : two ] .",
    "the idea that the black hole configuration is uniquely determined by its mass ( and any other conserved charges ) arose from studies of many simple examples of the matter fields .",
    "this idea of uniqueness was encoded in the statement `` black holes have no hair . ''",
    "( this statement is not strictly true when more general matter fields are considered . )",
    "it is a very interesting and precise requirement on the theory of quantum gravity plus matter that there be indeed just the number ( equation  [ eq : two ] ) of microstates corresponding to a given classical geometry of a black hole .",
    "if black holes have an entropy @xmath26 and an energy equal to the mass @xmath12 , then if thermodynamics were to be valid , we would expect them to have a temperature given by @xmath27 for a neutral black hole in four spacetime dimensions , @xmath28 , which gives t=(dsdm)^-1=18g_n m. [ eq : ntwo ] again assuming thermodynamical behavior , the above statement implies that if the hole can absorb photons at a given wave number @xmath29 with absorption cross section @xmath30 , then it must also radiate at the same wave number at the rate @xmath31 in other words , the emission rate is given by the absorption cross section multiplied by a standard thermal factor ( this factor would have a plus sign in place of the minus sign if we were considering fermion emission ) and a phase space factor that counts the number of states in the wave number range @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "( @xmath34 denotes the number of spatial dimensions . )",
    "classically , nothing can come out of the black hole horizon , so it is tempting to say that no such radiation is possible .",
    "however , in 1974 , hawking @xcite found that if the quantum behavior of matter fields is considered , such radiation is possible .",
    "the vacuum for the matter fields has fluctuations , so that pairs of particles and antiparticles are produced and annihilated continuously . in normal spacetimes ,",
    "the pair annihilates quickly in a time set by the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , in a black hole background , one member of this pair can fall into the hole , where it has a net negative energy , while the other member of the pair can escape to infinity as real positive energy radiation @xcite .",
    "the profile of this radiation is found to be thermal , with a temperature given by equation  [ eq : ntwo ] .",
    "although we have so far discussed the simplest black holes , there are black hole solutions that carry charge and angular momentum .",
    "we can also consider generalizations of general relativity to arbitrary numbers of spacetime dimensions ( as will be required below ) and further consider other matter fields in the theory .",
    "it is remarkable that the above discussed thermodynamic properties of black holes seem to be universal .",
    "the leading term in the entropy is in fact given by equation  [ eq : two ] for all black holes of all kinds in any number of dimensions .",
    "furthermore , the temperature is given in terms of another geometric quantity called the surface gravity at the horizon , @xmath35 , which is the acceleration felt by a static object at the horizon as measured from the asymptotic region .",
    "the precise relation  also universal  is t = 2 .",
    "[ eq : nthree ]      `` hawking radiation '' is produced from the quantum fluctuations of the matter vacuum , in the presence of the gravitational field of the hole .",
    "for black holes of masses much larger than the scale set by newton s constant , the gravitational field near the horizon , where the particle pairs are produced in this simple picture , is given quite accurately by the classical metric of equation  [ eq : one ] .",
    "the curvature invariants at the horizon are all very small compared with the planck scale , so quantum gravity seems not to be required .",
    "further , the calculation is insensitive to the precise details of the matter that went to make up the hole . thus , if the hole completely evaporates away , the final radiation state can not have any significant information about the initial matter state .",
    "this circumstance would contradict the assumption in usual quantum mechanics that the final state of any time evolution is related in a one - to - one and onto fashion to the initial state , through a unitary evolution operator .",
    "worse , the final state is in fact not even a normal quantum state .",
    "the outgoing member of a pair of particles created by the quantum fluctuation is in a mixed state with the member that falls into the hole , so that the outgoing radiation is highly `` entangled '' with whatever is left behind at the hole .",
    "if the hole completely evaporates away , then this final state is entangled with `` nothing , '' and we find that the resulting system is described not by a pure quantum state but by a mixed state .    if the above reasoning and computations are correct , one confronts a set of alternatives , none of which are very palatable ( for a survey see e.g.  reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the semiclassical reasoning used in the derivation of hawking radiation can not say whether the hole continues to evaporate after it reaches planck size , since at this point quantum gravity would presumably have to be important . the hole may not completely evaporate away but leave a `` remnant '' of planck size .",
    "the radiation sent off to infinity will remain entangled with this remnant . but this entanglement entropy is somewhat larger @xcite than the black hole entropy @xmath26 , which is a very large number ( as we have seen above ) .",
    "thus , the remnant will have to have a very large number of possible states , and this number will grow to infinity as the mass of the initial hole is taken to infinity . it is uncomfortable to have a theory in which a particle of bounded mass ( planck mass ) can have an infinite number of configurations .",
    "one might worry that in any quantum process , one can have loops of this remnant particle , and this contribution will diverge , since the number of states of the remnant is infinite .",
    "but it has been argued that remnants from holes of increasingly large mass might couple to any given process with correspondingly smaller strength , and then such a divergence can be avoided .",
    "another possibility , advocated most strongly by hawking , is that the hole does evaporate away to nothing , and the passage from an intial pure state to a final mixed state is a natural process in any theory of quantum gravity . in this view",
    ", the natural description of states is in fact in terms of density matrices , and the pure states of quantum mechanics that we are used to thinking about are only a special case of this more general kind of state .",
    "some investigations of this possibility have suggested , however , that giving up the purity of quantum states causes difficulties with maintaining energy conservation in virtual processes ( @xcite ; for a counterargument , see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that would best fit our experience of physics in general would be that the hawking radiation does manage to carry out the information of the collapsing matter @xcite .",
    "the hole could then completely evaporate away , and yet the process would be in line with the unitarity of quantum mechanics .",
    "the hawking radiation from the black hole would not fundamentally differ from the radiation from a lump of burning coal  the information of the atomic structure of the coal is contained , though it is difficult to decipher , in the radiation and other products that emerge when the coal burns away .",
    "let us review briefly the difficulties with having the radiation carry out the information .",
    "to study the evolution , we choose a foliation of the spacetime by smooth spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "this requires that the spatial slices be smooth and that the embedding of neighboring slices changes in a way that is not too sharp .",
    "as we evolve along this foliation , we see the matter fall in toward the center of the hole , while we see the radiation collect at spatial infinity .",
    "it is important to realize that the information in the collapsing matter can not also be copied into the radiation  in other words , there can be no quantum `` xeroxing . ''",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "suppose the evolution process makes two copies of a state @xmath36 where the @xmath37 are a set of basis states .",
    "then , as long as the linearity of quantum mechanics holds , we will find @xmath38 thus , a general state can not be `` duplicated '' by any quantum process .",
    "figure 1 shows the spacetime in a symbolic way .",
    "we use a foliation of spacetime by the following kind of spacelike hypersurfaces . away from the black hole ,",
    "say for @xmath39 , we let the hypersurface be a @xmath40 surface ( this description uses the schwarzschild coordinates of equation  [ eq : one ] ) . inside the black hole , an @xmath41constant surface is spacelike ; let us choose @xmath42 so that this part of the surface is neither close to the horizon ( @xmath43 nor close to the singularity ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this part of the hypersurface will extend from some time @xmath45 near the formation of the hole to the value @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we can connect these two parts of the hypersurface by a smooth interpolating region that is spacelike as well .",
    "each of the spacelike hypersurfaces shown in    figure  1 is assumed to be of this form .",
    "the lower one has @xmath45 , whereas the upper one corresponds to a time @xmath46 , where a mass @xmath47 has been evaporated away as radiation .",
    "we assume , however , that at @xmath48 the black hole is nowhere near its endpoint of evaporation , either by assuming that a slow dose of matter was continually fed into the black hole to maintain its size ( the simplest assumption ) or by considering a time @xmath48 where say a quarter of the hole has evaporated ( and modifying the metric to reflect the slow decrease of black hole mass ) .    on the lower hypersurface",
    ", we have on the left the matter that fell in to make the hole .",
    "there is no radiation yet , so there is nothing else on this hypersurface .",
    "let us call this matter `` a. '' on the upper hypersurface , we expect the following sources of stress energy , in a semiclassical analysis of the hawking process . on the left , we will still have the matter that fell in to make the hole , since this part of the surface is common to both hypersurfaces . on the extreme right",
    ", we will have the hawking radiation that has emerged in the evaporation process ; let us call this `` c. '' in the middle are the infalling members of the particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "these contribute a negative value to the total mass of the system because of the way the hypersurface is oriented with respect to the coordinate @xmath49this maintains overall energy conservation in the process .",
    "let us call this part of the state `` b. ''    the semiclassical process gives a state for the light matter fields , which is entangled between components b and c. on the other hand , components a and b are expected to somehow vanish together ( or leave a planck mass remnant ) , since their energies cancel each other . at the end of the process",
    ", the radiation c will have the energy initially present in a. but since c will be entangled with b , the final state will not be a pure state of radiation .",
    "we can now see explicitly the difficulties with obtaining in any theory a unitary description of the process of black hole formation and evaporation . in a general curved spacetime",
    ", we should be able to evolve our hypersurfaces by different amounts at different points  this is the `` many - fingered time '' evolution of general relativity extended to include the quantum matter on the spacetime . by using an appropriate choice of this evolution ,",
    "we have captured both the infalling matter a and the outgoing radiation c on the same spacelike hypersurface .",
    "if we want the radiation c to carry the information of the matter a , then we will need `` quantum xeroxing , '' which , as mentioned above , can not happen if we accept the principle of superposition of quantum mechanics .",
    "it would have been very satisfactory if we just could not draw a smooth hypersurface like the upper one in figure  1 , a hypersurface that includes both the infalling matter and the outgoing radiation .",
    "for example , we could have hoped that any such surface would need to be non - spacelike at some point , or that it would need a sharp kink in one or more places .",
    "but it is easy to see from the construction of surfaces described above that all the hypersurfaces in the evolution are smooth .",
    "in fact , the later one is in some sense just a time translate of the earlier one  the part @xmath50 in each surface has the same intrinsic ( and extrinsic ) geometry for each hypersurface , and the segment that connects this part to the @xmath51 part can be taken to be the same as well .",
    "the only difference between the hypersurfaces is that the later one has a larger @xmath51 part .",
    "one can further check that the infalling matter has finite energy along each hypersurface and that scalar quantities such as @xmath52 are bounded and smooth along each surface ( @xmath53 is the proper length along the surface ) . in the above calculations ,",
    "spacetime was treated classically , but the conclusions do not change even if we let the evolution of spacelike surfaces be described by the wheeler  de  witt equation , which gives a naive quantization of gravity ; quantum fluctuations of the spacetime may appear large in certain coordinates @xcite , but such effects cancel out in the computation of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that in order to have unitarity one needs a nonlocal mechanism ( which operates over macroscopic distances @xmath47 ) that moves the information from a to c. even though the spacetime appears to have no regions of planck - scale curvature , we must alter our understanding of how information in one set of low - energy modes ( a ) moves into another set of low energy modes ( c ) .",
    "a key point appears to be that , in the semiclassical calculation , the radiation c emerges from modes of the quantum field that in the past had a frequency much higher than planck frequency .",
    "a naive model of the quantum field would have these modes at all frequencies , but if the complete theory of matter and gravity has an inbuilt cutoff at the planck scale , then the radiation c must have had its origins somewhere else  possibly in some nonlocal combination of modes with sub - planckian energy .",
    "if some such possibility is true , we would obtain unitarity , while also obtaining some nontrivial insight into the high - energy structure of the quantum vacuum .",
    "basic to such an approach would be some way of understanding a black hole as a complicated version of usual matter states , and not as an esoteric new object that must be added to a theory of `` regular '' matter .",
    "it would still be true that the final state of a system changes character significantly when its density changes from that of a star , for instance , to the density at which it collapses to form a black hole , but the resulting hole should still be described by the same essential principles of quantum mechanics , density of states , statistical mechanics , etc , as any other matter system . as we show below",
    ", string theory provides not only a consistent theory of quantized gravity and matter , but also a way of thinking about black holes as quantum states of the matter variables in the theory .",
    "in a certain regime of parameters , string theory is best thought of as a theory of interacting elementary strings ( for expositions of superstring theory , see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic scale is set by the string tension @xmath54 or , equivalently , the `` string length '' l_s = 1 .",
    "[ eq : szero ] the quantized harmonics of a string represent particles of various masses and spins , and the masses are typically integral multiples of @xmath55 .",
    "thus , at energies much smaller than @xmath55 , only the lowest harmonics are relevant . the interaction between strings",
    "is controlled by a dimensionless string coupling @xmath56 , and the above description of the theory in terms of propagating and interacting strings is a good description when @xmath57 . even in weak coupling perturbation theory",
    ", quantization imposes rather severe restrictions on possible string theories .",
    "in particular , all consistent string theories ( @xmath58 ) live in ten spacetime dimensions and ( @xmath59 ) respect supersymmetry . at the perturbative level , there are five such string theories , although recent developments in nonperturbative string theory show that these five theories are in fact perturbations around different vacua of a single theory , whose structure is only incompletely understood at this point ( for a review of string dualities , see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , in all these theories there is a set of exactly massless modes that describe the very - low - energy behavior of the theory .",
    "string theories have the potential to provide a unified theory of all interactions and matter .",
    "the most common scenario for this is to choose @xmath60 to be of the order of the planck scale , although there have been recent suggestions that this length scale can be considerably longer without contradicting known experimental facts @xcite .",
    "the massless modes then describe the observed low - energy world .",
    "of course , to describe the real world , most of these modes must acquire a mass , typically much smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that the massless modes of open strings are gauge fields .",
    "the lowest state of an open string carries one quantum of the lowest vibration mode of the string with a polarization @xmath61 ; this gives the gauge boson @xmath62 .",
    "the effective low - energy field theory is a supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the closed string can carry traveling waves both clockwise and counterclockwise along its length .",
    "in closed string theories , the state with one quantum of the lowest harmonic in each direction is a massless spin-2 particle , which is in fact the graviton : if the transverse directions of the vibrations are @xmath61 and @xmath63 , then we get the graviton @xmath64",
    ". the low - energy limits of closed string theories thus contain gravity and are supersymmetric extensions of general relativity",
    ". however , unlike these local theories of gravity , which are not renormalizable , string theory yields a _",
    "finite _ theory of gravity  essentially due to the extended nature of the string .",
    "how can such theories in ten dimensions describe our 4-dimensional world ?",
    "the point is that all of the dimensions need not be infinitely extended  some of them can be compact .",
    "consider , for example , the simplest situation , in which the 10-dimensional spacetime is flat and the `` internal '' 6-dimensional space is a 6-torus @xmath65 with ( periodic ) coordinates @xmath66 , which we choose to be all of the same period : @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath68 denotes the coordinates of the noncompact 4-dimensional spacetime , we can write a scalar field @xmath69 as ( x , y ) = _ n_i _ n_i ( x )  , [ eq : sone ] where @xmath70 denotes the six components of integer - valued momenta @xmath71 along the internal directions .",
    "when , for example , @xmath72 is a massless field satisfying the standard klein - gordon equation @xmath73 , it is clear from equation  [ eq : sone ] that the field @xmath74 has ( in four dimensions ) a mass @xmath75 given by @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a single field in higher dimensions becomes an infinite number of fields in the noncompact world . for energies",
    "much lower than @xmath77 , only the @xmath78 mode can be excited . for other kinds of internal manifolds ,",
    "the essential physics is the same .",
    "now , however , we have more complicated wavefunctions on the internal space .",
    "what is rather nontrivial is that when one applies the same mechanism to the spacetime metric , the effective lower - dimensional world contains a metric field as well as vector gauge fields and scalar matter fields .      before the advent of strings as a theory of quantum gravity",

    "the greater the number of supersymmetries , the better was the control of divergences .",

    "there are two types of gravitinos ",
    "fermionic partners of the graviton .",
    "one of them has positive 10-dimensional chirality whereas the other has negative chirality .",
    "the resulting theory is thus nonchiral .",
    "there is another supergravity in ten dimensions , type iib supergravity .",
    "this can not be obtained from d=11 supergravity by dimensional reduction .",

    "because of the self - duality constraint on the 5-form field strength , it is not possible to write down the action for type iib supergravity , although the equations of motion make perfect sense . if , however , we put the 5-form field strength to zero , we have a local action given by & s = 1 ( 2)^7 g^2 l_s^8d^10 x [ ( r - & 12()^2 -112e^- h_h^ + & & - 112e^ ( h_- h_)(h^ - h^ ) ] . + [ eq : hsixa ] of course , these supergravities can not be consistently quantized , since they are not renormalizable",
    ". however , they are the low - energy limits of string theories , called the type iia and type iib string .",
    "although string theory removes ultraviolet divergences leading to a finite theory of gravity , such features as the necessity of ten dimensions and the presence of an infinite tower of modes above the massless graviton made it unpalatable to many physicists .",
    "furthermore , some find the change from a pointlike particle to a string somewhat arbitrary ",
    "if we accept strings , then why not extended objects of other dimensionalities ?    over the past few years ,",
    "as nonperturbative string theory has developed , it has been realized that the features of string theory are actually very natural and also perhaps essential to any correct theory of quantum gravity .",
    "a crucial ingredient in this new insight is the fact that higher - dimensional extended objects  branes  are present in the spectrum of string theory",
    ".      a closer look at even supergravity theories leads to the observation that the existence of extended objects is natural within those theories ( and in fact turns out to be essential to completing them to unitary theories at the quantum level ) .",
    "consider the case of 11-dimensional supergravity .",
    "the supercharge @xmath114 is a spinor , with @xmath115 .",
    "the anticommutator of two supercharge components should lead to a translation , so we write @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the charge conjugation matrix . because the anticommutator is symmetric in @xmath118 , we find that there are @xmath119 objects on the left - hand side of this equation , but only @xmath120 objects ( the @xmath121 ) on the right - hand side .",
    "if we write down all the possible terms on the right that are allowed by lorentz symmetry , then we find @xcite    \\{q _ , q_}=(^a c)_p_a+(^a ^b c)_z_ab+(^a ^b^c ^d^e c)_z_abcde , [ eq : stwo ] where the @xmath122 are totally antisymmetric .",

    "although , for example , @xmath128 implies that the configuration has momentum in direction @xmath129 , what is the interpretation of @xmath130 ?",
    "it turns out that this can be interpreted as the presence of a `` sheetlike '' charged object stretched along the directions @xmath131 .",
    "it is then logical to postulate that there exists in the theory a 2-dimensional fundamental object ( the 2-brane ) .",
    "similarly , the charge @xmath125 corresponds to a 5-brane in the theory .",
    "the 2-brane has a @xmath132-dimensional world volume and couples naturally to the 3-form gauge field present in 11-dimensional supergravity , just as a particle with 1-dimensional world line couples to a 1-form gauge field as @xmath133 .",
    "the 5-brane is easily seen to be the magnetic dual to the 2-brane , and it couples to the 6-form that is dual to the 3-form gauge field in 11 dimensions .",
    "thus , it is natural to include some specific extended objects in the quantization of 11-dimensional supergravity . but how does this relate to string theory , which lives in ten dimensions ? let us compactify the 11-dimensional spacetime on a small circle , thus obtaining 10-dimensional noncompact spacetime .",
    "then , if we let the 2-brane wrap this small circle , we get what looks like a string in ten dimensions .",
    "this is exactly the type iia string that had been quantized by the string theorists !",
    "the size of the small compact circle turns out to be the coupling constant of the string .",
    "we can also choose not to wrap the 2-brane on the small circle , in which case there should be a two - dimensional extended object in type iia string theory .",
    "such an object is indeed present ",
    "it is one of the d - branes shown to exist in string theory by polchinski @xcite .",
    "similarly , we may wrap the 5-brane on the small circle , getting a 4-dimensional d - brane in string theory , or leave it unwrapped , getting a solitonic 5-brane , which is also known to exist in the theory .",
    "thus , one is forced to a unique set of extended objects in the theory , with specified interactions between them  in fact , there is no freedom to add or remove any object , nor to change any couplings .",
    "a very important property of such branes is that when they are in an unexcited state , they preserve some of the supersymmetries of the system , and are thus bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield saturated ( bps ) states .",
    "let us see in a simple context what a bps state is .",
    "consider first a theory with a single supercharge @xmath134 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the hamiltonian .",
    "these relations show that the energy of any state can not be negative . if @xmath137 then @xmath138 where the equality holds in the last step if and only if @xmath139 that is , the state is supersymmetric .",

    "now suppose there are two such supersymmetries : @xmath144 where @xmath122 is a `` charge '' ; it will take a @xmath3 number value on the states that we consider below . in a spirit similar to the calculations above",
    ", we can now conclude @xmath145 this implies that @xmath146 with equality holding if and only if @xmath147 now we have three kinds of states :    1 .   states with @xmath148 .",
    "these have @xmath143 and do not fall into a multiplet . by equation  [ eq : twoseven ]",
    ", they also have @xmath149 , so they carry no charge .",
    "states not in category 1 , but satisfying equation  [ eq : twonine ] . for concreteness ,",
    "take the case @xmath150 .",
    "these states fall into a `` short multiplet '' described by , say , the basis @xmath151 .",
    "note that @xmath152 so that we have no more linearly independent states in the multiplet .",
    "such states satisfy @xmath153 and are called bps states .",
    "note that by equation  [ eq : twoseven ] , the state with @xmath154 satisfies @xmath150 while the state with @xmath155 satisfies @xmath156 .",
    "states that are not annihilated by any linear combination of @xmath157 .",
    "these form a `` long multiplet '' @xmath158 .",
    "they must have @xmath159 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have regarded the bps states as states of a quantum system , but a similar analysis applies to classical solutions . in 10-dimensional supergravity , the branes mentioned above appear as classical solutions of the equations of motion , typically with sources .",
    "they are massive solitonlike objects and therefore produce gravitational fields . apart from that",
    ", they produce the p - form gauge fields to which they couple and , in general , a nontrivial dilaton .",
    "a brane in a general configuration would break all the supersymmetries of the theory . however , for special configurations  corresponding to `` unexcited branes''there are solutions which retain some of the supersymmetries .",
    "these are bps saturated solutions , and since they have the maximal charge for a given mass , they are stable objects .",
    "we use such branes below in constructing black holes .      instead of using the 11-dimensional algebra ,",
    "we could have used the 10-dimensional algebra and arrived at the same conclusions . in a similar fashion",
    ", the existence of bps branes in type iib supergravity follows from the corresponding algebra . for each antisymmetric tensor field present in the spectrum , there is a corresponding bps brane .",
    "thus we have    1 .",
    "d(@xmath160)-brane , or d - instantons , carrying charge under the axion field @xmath108 ; 2 .",

    "we have denoted some of the branes as d - branes .",
    "these play a special role in string theory , as explained below .",
    "consider the low - energy action of the supergravity theories .",
    "we have remarked above that the equations of motion for the massless fields admit solitonic solutions , where the solitons are not in general pointlike but could be @xmath162-dimensional sheets in space [ thus having @xmath163-dimensional world volumes in spacetime ] . in each of these cases ,",
    "the soliton involves the gravitational field and some other @xmath163-form field in the supergravity multiplet so that the final solution carries a charge under this @xmath163-form gauge field .",
    "in fact , in appropriate units , this soliton is seen to have a mass equal to its charge and is thus an object satisfying the bps bound of supersymmetric theories .",
    "this fact implies that the soliton is a stable construct in the theory .",
    "the possible values of @xmath162 are determined entirely by the properties of fermions in the type ii theory .",
    "it turns out that for type iia , @xmath162 must be even ( @xmath164 ) , whereas for type iib @xmath162 must be odd ( @xmath165 ) . recalling the massless spectrum of these theories , we find that for each antisymmetric tensor field there is a brane that couples to it .",
    "because the brane is not pointlike but is an extended object , we can easily see that there will be low - energy excitations of this soliton in which its world sheet suffers small transverse displacements that vary along the brane ( in other words , the brane carries waves corresponding to transverse vibrations ) .",
    "the low - energy action is thus expected to be the tension of the brane times its area . for a single 1-brane , for instance",
    ", the action for long - wavelength deformations is s = t_1 2d^2^ , [ eq : sseven ] where @xmath166 , with @xmath167 , denotes an arbitrary coordinate sytem on the d1-brane world sheet and @xmath168 denotes the induced metric on the brane , g _ = _",
    "x^_x^_. [ eq : seight ] the @xmath169 with @xmath170 , denotes the coordinates of a point on the brane .",
    "this action is invariant under arbitrary transformations of the coordinates @xmath166 on the brane . to make contact with to the picture discussed above , it is best to work in a static gauge by choosing @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the induced metric ( equation  [ eq : seight ] ) then becomes g _",
    "_ ij , where @xmath173 with @xmath174 , are the remaining fields .",
    "the determinant in equation  [ eq : sseven ] may be then expanded in powers of @xmath175 .",
    "the lowest - order term is just the free kinetic energy term for the eight scalar fields @xmath176 .",
    "it is now straightforward to extend the above discussion for higher - dimensional branes .",
    "now we can have both transverse and longitudinal oscillations of the brane .",
    "for a @xmath162-brane we have @xmath177 transverse coordinates , labeled by @xmath178 , and hence as many scalar fields on the @xmath163-dimensional brane world volume , @xmath176 .",
    "it turns out that the longitudinal waves are carried by a @xmath97 _ gauge _ field @xmath179 with the index @xmath180 ranging over the world volume directions .",
    "the generalization of equation  [ eq : sseven ] [ called the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action ] is s = t_p 2d^p+1 , where @xmath181 is the gauge field strength .",
    "once again , one can choose a static gauge and relate the fields directly to a string theory description .",
    "the low - energy expansion of the action then leads to electrodynamics in @xmath163 dimensions with some neutral scalars and fermions .    in the above description",
    ", we had obtained the branes as classical solutions of the supergravity fields ; this is the analog of describing a point charge by its classical electromagnetic potential .",
    "such a description should apply to a collection of a large number of fundamental branes all placed at the same location .",
    "but we would like to obtain also the microscopic quantum physics of a single brane .",
    "how do we see such an object in string theory ?",
    "the mass per unit volume of a d - brane in string units is @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the string coupling .",
    "so the brane would not be seen as a perturbative object at weak coupling .",
    "but the excitations of the brane will still be low - energy modes , and these should be seen in weakly coupled string theory .",
    "in fact , when we quantize a free string we have two choices : to consider open strings or closed strings .",
    "if we have an open string then we need boundary conditions at the ends of the string that do not allow the energy of vibration of the string to flow off the end .",
    "there are two possibilities : to let the ends move at the speed of light , which corresponds to neumann ( n ) boundary conditions , or to fix the end , which corresponds to dirichlet ( d ) boundary conditions .",
    "of course we can choose different types of conditions for different directions of motion in spacetime .",
    "if the ends of the open strings are free to move along the directions @xmath166 but are fixed in the other directions @xmath184 , then the ends are constrained to lie along a @xmath162-dimensional surface that we may identify with a @xmath162-brane , and such open strings describe the excitations of the @xmath162-brane @xcite . because these branes were discovered through their excitations , which were in turn a consequence of d - type boundary conditions on the open strings , the branes are themselves called d - branes .",
    "( for a review of properties of d - branes , see reference  @xcite . )",
    "an interesting effect occurs when two such branes are brought close to each other .",
    "the open strings that begin and end on the first brane will describe excitations of the first brane , and those that begin and end on the second brane will describe excitations of the second brane .",
    "but , as shown in figure  2 , an open string can also begin on the first brane and end on the second , or begin on the second and end on the first , and this gives two additional possibilities for the excitation of the system .",
    "these four possibilities can in fact be encoded into a @xmath185 matrix , with the @xmath186 element of the matrix given by open strings that begin on the @xmath61th brane and end on the @xmath63th brane .",
    "this structure immediately extends to the case where @xmath187 branes approach each other .",
    "the low - energy limits of open string theories are generally gauge theories .",

    "the analog of the dbi action for a collection of @xmath187 branes is not completely known at present , although there are some proposals ( for discussion see reference  @xcite and references therein ) . however , the low - energy action is that of a standard supersymmetric yang - mills theory in @xmath201 dimensions .",

    "if we wrap on the compact circle both the 5-brane and the 2-brane that ends on it , then in the type iia theory we get a d4-brane and an open string ending on the d4-brane .",
    "but if we do not wrap the 5-brane on the circle , and thus get a 5-brane in the type iia theory , then the open string can not end on this brane , since there is no corresponding picture of such an endpoint in 11 dimensions .",
    "the physics of the 5-brane in type iia theory is an interesting one , but we will not discuss it further .",
    "much more is known about the physics of d - branes in type iia and iib theories , since they can be studied through perturbative open string theory .",
    "branes of different kinds can also form bound states , and for specific instances these can be threshold bound states .",
    "a useful example is a bound state of @xmath208 d1-branes and @xmath209 d5-branes . when these branes are not excited , they are in a threshold bound state . the open strings that describe this system are ( @xmath58 ) @xmath210 strings with both endpoints on any of the d1-branes ; ( @xmath59 ) @xmath211 strings with both endpoints on d5-branes ; and ( @xmath3 ) @xmath212 and @xmath213 strings with one endpoint on any of the d1-branes and the other endpoint on one of the d5-branes .",
    "a remarkable feature of string theory is the large group of symmetries called dualities ( see reference  @xcite for review ) .",
    "consider type iia theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath84 .",
    "we can take a graviton propagating along this compact direction ; its energy spectrum would have the form @xmath214 .",
    "but we can also wind an elementary string on this circle ; the spectrum here would be @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the winding number of the string and @xmath54 its tension .",
    "we note that if we replace @xmath217 , then the energies of the above two sets of states are simply interchanged .",
    "in fact this map , called t - duality , is an exact symmetry of string theory ; it interchanges winding and momentum modes , and because of an effect on fermions , it also turns a type iia theory into type iib and vice versa .",
    "the type iib theory also has another symmetry called s - duality , there the string coupling @xmath56 goes to @xmath218 . at the same time , the role of the elementary string is interchanged with the d1-brane .",
    "such a duality , which relates weak coupling to strong coupling while interchanging fundamental quanta with solitonic objects , is a realization of the duality suggested for field theory by montonen & olive @xcite .",
    "the combination of s- and t - dualities generates a larger group , the u - duality group .",
    "there are other dualities , such as those that relate type iia theory to heterotic string theory , and those that relate these theories to the theory of unoriented strings . in this article",
    ", we do not use the idea of dualities directly , but we note that any black hole that we construct by using branes is related by duality maps to a large class of similar holes that have the same physics , so the physics obtained is much more universal than it may at first appear .",
    "string theory is a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "thus , black holes should appear in this theory as excited quantum states .",
    "an idea of susskind @xcite has proved very useful in the study of black holes . because the coupling in the theory is not a constant but a variable field",
    ", we can study a state of the theory at weak coupling , where we can use our knowledge of string theory .",
    "thus we may compute the `` entropy '' of the state , which would be the logarithm of the number of states with the same mass and charges .",
    "now imagine the coupling to be tuned to strong values .",
    "then the gravitational coupling also increases , and the object must become a black hole with a large radius . for this black hole we can compute the bekenstein entropy from ( equation  [ eq : two ] ) , and ask if the microscopic computation agrees with the bekenstein entropy .",
    "for such a calculation to make sense , we must have some assurance that the density of states would not shift when we change the coupling .",
    "this is where bps states come in .",
    "we have shown above that the masses of bps saturated states are indeed determined once we know their charges , which are simply their winding numbers on cycles of the compact space .",
    "thus , for such states , we may calculate the degeneracy of states at weak coupling and , since the degeneracy can be predicted also at strong coupling , compare the result with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the corresponding black hole .",
    "such states give , at strong coupling , black holes that are `` extremal''they have the minimal mass for their charge if we require that the metric does not have a naked singularity .",
    "the extended objects discussed in the previous section have played an important role in understanding black holes in string theory .",
    "an example of such an object is a fundamental string in type iia or iib string theory .",
    "let some of the directions of the 10-dimensional spacetime be compactified on small circles . take a fundamental string and",
    "wrap it @xmath219 times around one of these circles , say along the @xmath220 direction , which has a radius @xmath84 .",
    "this will produce a rank-2 ns field @xmath221 with a charge @xmath219 , which is a `` winding charge . ''",
    "the energy of the state is @xmath222 , which saturates the bps bound . from the point of view of the noncompact directions ,",
    "this looks like a massive point object carrying electric charge under the gauge field that results from the dimensional reduction of the rank-2 field . from the microscopic viewpoint ,",
    "the state of such a string is unique ( it does have a 256-fold degeneracy due to supersymmetry , but we can ignore this  it is not a number that grows with @xmath219 ) .",
    "thus , the microscopic entropy is zero .",
    "if we increase the coupling , we expect a charged black hole .",
    "furthermore , this is an extremal black hole , since for a given charge @xmath219 this has the lowest allowed mass given by the energy given above .",
    "however , this black hole turns out to have a vanishing horizon area .",
    "one way to understand this is to note that the tension of the string `` pinches '' the circle where the string was wrapped .",
    "thus , entropy is zero from both the microscopic and the black hole viewpoints , which is consistent but not really interesting .    to prevent this pinching",
    ", we can put some momentum along the string , which amounts to having traveling waves move along the string .",
    "the momentum modes have an energy that goes as @xmath77 , so now this circle attains a finite size .",
    "if we put waves that are moving only in one of the directions , we still have a bps saturated state , but with a further half of the supersymmetries broken .",
    "the total energy of the state is now given by @xmath223 , where the second term is now the contribution from the momentum waves .",
    "because of the winding , the effective length of the string is @xmath224 , so that the momentum may be written as @xmath225 .",
    "thus , for given values of @xmath219 and @xmath226 , a large number of states have the same energy .",
    "these correspond to the various ways one can get the oscillator level @xmath227 . in addition , it is necessary to consider the fact that there are eight possible polarizations , and there are fermionic oscillators as well .",
    "the resulting degeneracy of states has been known since the early days of string theory . for large @xmath219 and @xmath226 ,",

    "the second charge is due to the presence of momentum , which results in a term in the 10-dimensional metric proportional to @xmath228 .",
    "then , by the kaluza - klein mechanism explained in the previous section , this is equivalent to a gauge field @xmath229 from the viewpoint of the noncompact world .",

    "the classical solution for @xmath187 parallel extremal 3-branes along @xmath398 is given by the ( einstein - frame ) metric ds^2 = [ f(r)]^-1/2[-dt^2 + dx^2 ] + [ f(r)]^1/2[dr^2 + r^2 d_5 ^ 2 ] , [ eq : tbone ] where @xmath399 is the radial coordinate in the transverse space , @xmath400 are the coordinates on the brane , and @xmath401 is the measure on a unit 5-sphere . the harmonic function @xmath402 is given by f(r ) = 1 + ( r r ) ^4  r^4 = 4g_s n l_s^4 .",
    "[ eq : tbtwo ] the dilaton is a constant and the only other nontrivial field is the 4-form gauge field with a field strength f_0789r = 4 r^4 g_s r^5[f(r)]^-2 .",
    "[ eq : tbthree ] the horizon is at @xmath241 and the horizon area is indeed zero .",
    "however , the spacetime is completely nonsingular . in the near - horizon or near - brane region @xmath403 ,",
    "the metric ( equation  [ eq : tbthree ] ) becomes , in terms of coordinates @xmath404 , ds^2 = ( r z ) ^2[-dt^2 + dx^2 + dz^2 ] + r^2 d_5 ^ 2 .",
    "[ eq : tbthreea ] this is the metric of the space ads@xmath405 , the first factor being composed of @xmath406 while the sphere @xmath407 has a constant radius @xmath84 . the ads@xmath408 has a constant negative curvature @xmath409 , whereas the sphere @xmath407 has a constant positive curvature .",
    "thus , near the horizon the spacetime approaches a `` throat geometry , '' where the length of the throat is along the ads@xmath408 coordinates and the cross sections are 5-spheres of constant radii @xmath84 .    from equation  [ eq : tbtwo ]",
    "it follows that this curvature is much smaller than the string scale when @xmath410 .",
    "this is thus the regime where semiclassical supergravity is valid .",
    "it is possible to calculate the classical absorption cross section of various supergravity modes by the extremal 3-brane . for s - wave absorption of minimally coupled scalars , the leading - order result is @xcite = 18 ^ 4 r^8 ^3 = 132 ( n)^2 ^3 , [ eq : tbfour ] where we have used equation  [ eq : tbtwo ] .",
    "the cross section of course vanishes at @xmath411 , since the horizon area vanishes .",
    "also note that we are dealing with an extremal solution that has zero temperature , so we have absorption but no hawking radiation .",
    "it turns out that in this case one can also analytically calculate the low - energy absorption cross section of such scalars for arbitrary angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the microscopic theory of @xmath187 3-branes is a @xmath188 gauge theory in @xmath412 dimensions with 16 supersymmetries , or @xmath329 supersymmetry .",
    "this is a well - studied theory and is known to be conformally invariant with zero beta function .",
    "it is the dimensional reduction of @xmath413 supersymmetric yang - mills in ten dimensions .",
    "as we will see below , a natural symmetry argument determines the coupling of some of the supergravity modes to the brane degrees of freedom .",
    "however , if we consider modes like the dilaton and longitudinal traceless parts of the 10-dimensional graviton , the coupling can be once again read off from the equivalence principle .",
    "for example , the longitudinal graviton has to couple to the energy - momentum tensor of the yang - mills theory .",
    "thus , one can perturbatively calculate the absorption cross section of such modes ( which are minimal scalars from the 7-dimensional point of view ) along the lines of the calculation in the 5-dimensional black hole .",
    "again , an exact agreement was found for s - waves @xcite , and the agreement was found to extend to all angular momenta @xcite .    in this case , the reason for the agreement of the weak coupling calculation with supergravity answers is much better understood . in particular , it is known that the two - point function of the energy - momentum tensor of @xmath329 yang - mills theory is not renormalized , so that the lowest - order result is exact @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the two - point function in euclidean space is in turn related to the absorption cross section , which is thus also protected from higher - order corrections .",
    "there are similar nonrenormalization theorems known for operators coupling to other modes as well .",
    "the extremal 3-brane of supergravity described above is of course a limit of a general nonextremal solution with finite horizon area and finite temperature .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that the microscopic description of this is in terms of a yang - mills theory at finite temperature .",
    "the thermodynamics of this yang - mills theory was calculated @xcite at lowest order in the coupling constant ( i.e.  a free gas ) , and it was found that although the dependence of the thermodynamic quantities on the energy , volume , and @xmath187 is the same as in semiclassical thermodynamics of the corresponding black brane , the precise coefficient differs by a factor of @xmath414 . we know of no reason why the thermodynamic quantities are not renormalized as we go from weak to strong coupling , so the discrepancy is not unexpected .",
    "however , it is significant that the dependences agree  although the dependence on the energy and the volume is dictated by scaling arguments ( this is a conformally invariant theory ) , the dependence on @xmath187 is not . at weak coupling ,",
    "we know that there are @xmath189 degrees of freedom ; there is no known argument why this should continue at strong coupling .",
    "we have presented a unitary description of black hole evaporation in terms of the emission of closed strings from the branes .",
    "this description was at weak coupling ; in order to describe absorption by the black hole of quanta with arbitrary energies , one must imagine that it is continued to strong coupling .",
    "let us see what form this continuation to higher energies might take .",
    "in the lowest - order calculation , there was only one string interaction , where two open strings joined up to the emitted closed string . at higher orders in the coupling , we expect the emitted string to interact several times with the branes before escaping to infinity as radiation .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the case of the d3-branes described above .",
    "each such interaction gives one `` hole '' on the string world sheet , with the boundary of the hole being constrained to the branes .    from the viewpoint of the dynamics of open strings on the 3-branes , each hole looks like an open string loop .",
    "thus , as we increase the coupling , we encounter higher loop processes among the open strings , in the process of emitting a closed string .    on the other hand , a loop of open strings can be interpreted as a propagation of a closed string at tree level ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "thus , these open string multiloop processes might be reinterpreted as closed string exchanges between the departing quantum and the branes . but among such closed string exchange must be the effect of the gravitational effect of the branes , which , crudely speaking , would attempt to retard the outgoing quantum , redshifting it to lower energies .",
    "such a redshift is easily seen if we consider the propagation of the outgoing quantum in the metric produced by the branes .",
    "but now we ask : as we increase the coupling in the microscopic calculation , should we take into account the complicated loop processes of the gauge theory ( which are significant when the open string @xmath415 coupling is not small ) , as well as the fact that the metric around the branes will cease to be flat ?",
    "( this curvature is significant when the closed string coupling @xmath416 ceases to be small . )",
    "the discussion above indicates that taking both of these effects into account might amount to overcounting .",
    "the effect of open string loops might well be counted in the propagation of closed string modes ( which include gravitons that can be said to condense to generate the curvature ) .",
    "it is hard to answer this question from a direct consideration of loop expansions , since in the domain of large coupling we are unlikely to have any good expansion in the number of loops .",
    "thus , the above considerations are somewhat heuristic .",
    "the situation is reminiscent , though , of the appearance of duality in tree - level string scattering .",
    "the @xmath49-channel exchange has a sequence of poles , as does the @xmath53-channel scattering , and we confront the issue of whether these are two different effects to be added together in some way or just dual manifestations of a common underlying dynamics . in the case of this string scattering , of course , it is now well understood that the @xmath53-channel poles result from an infinite sum over @xmath49-channel poles and are not to be considered as additional contributions to the @xmath22-matrix .      in the much more complicated case of the black hole evaporation process , maldacena s bold postulate addressed the relation between microscopic theory of the branes and the effects of gravity in 10-dimensional spacetime .",
    "maldacena considered the following limit .",
    "place together a large number @xmath417 of d3-branes .",
    "let the string coupling be weak ( @xmath418 ) , but take the limits of large @xmath187 and small @xmath183 in such a way that @xmath419 tends to a finite value .",
    "now consider energies of excitation that are low , so that on the d3-branes we get open strings but only in their lowest states .",
    "the dynamics of these open strings is , as we saw above , given by a ( @xmath420 ) supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the quantity @xmath421 is the t hooft coupling of the gauge theory . at small t hooft coupling",
    ", we can study the large-@xmath187 gauge theory perturbatively ; at large t hooft coupling @xmath422 such a perturbative analysis is not possible .",
    "but for @xmath423 we are in a regime where the d3-branes produce an appreciable gravitational field around themselves , and in fact distort the spacetime into the form of equation  [ eq : tbone ] .",
    "in particular , as shown above , as we approach the horizon the geometry becomes the throat geometry ads@xmath405 given by equation  [ eq : tbthreea ] .",
    "maldacena postulated that we can consider either ( @xmath58 ) the gauge theory on the branes ( which is given by the open string interactions at a perturbative level ) or ( @xmath59 ) no branes , but the space ads@xmath424 and closed string theory ( which has gravity as a low - energy limit ) on this curved manifold .",
    "these two theories were dual descriptions of exactly the same underlying theory .",
    "if the gauge theory of the branes and gravity on the 10-dimensional spacetime are indeed exactly dual descriptions of the same theory , then we must have a way of computing the same quantity in two dual ways , and thus to see manifestly the consequences of this duality . to do this , we need an operational definition of the dual map , which was provided by gubser et al @xcite and witten @xcite .",
    "let us rotate the signature of the spacetime to a euclidean one .",
    "in this case , the space spanned by @xmath425 , which is now euclidean ads@xmath408 , has @xmath44 as a regular point in the interior of the space .",
    "thus , there is no singularity that might represent the place where the d3-branes were placed in a gauge theory description . but this space has a boundary at @xmath426 , which has the topology of @xmath427 .",
    "the conjecture now states that string theory on this smooth ads@xmath424 is dual to @xmath420 supersymmetric @xmath428 yang - mills on the 4-dimensional boundary of the ads space .",
    "note that in this formulation of the conjecture , all reference to d3-branes has disappeared .",
    "in fact , a geometry that is ads@xmath429 everywhere ( and not just at small @xmath236 ) is an exact solution of string theory without any branes present .",
    "we take the 5-form field strength @xmath104 present in type iib string theory to have a constant value with integral @xmath187 on the @xmath407 ; since this field must be self - dual , it also has a constant value on the ads@xmath408 .",
    "the energy density of this field yields the equal and opposite curvatures of the @xmath407 and the ads@xmath408 spaces ; the radius of curvature in each case is @xmath430 ( @xmath60 is the string length ) .",
    "if we had taken a collection of d3-branes as above , then the flux of @xmath104 on the sphere surrounding the branes would have been @xmath187 , but only the near - brane geometry would have resembled ads@xmath431at large @xmath236 the space becomes flat .",
    "thus , it seems better to formulate the duality without reference to any d - branes , although , as we discuss below , this makes the issues related to black hole information loss somewhat more difficult to access .    an important fact that led maldacena to the duality conjecture was the agreement of global symmetries between the gravity theory and the gauge theory .",
    "ads@xmath408 is a maximally symmetric space with a 15-parameter isometry group .",
    "the gauge theory is in four dimensions , so one may expect a 10-dimensional set of symmetries , which are the translations and rotations on @xmath427 .",
    "but the @xmath420 supersymmetric @xmath428 yang - mills theory is a conformal theory , and the conformal group in four dimensions is indeed isomorphic to the 15-parameter group of isometries of ads@xmath408 space .",
    "further , the @xmath420 gauge theory has four supercharges forming , having an @xmath432 symmetry of rotations among themselves .",
    "the gravity theory has an internal space that is @xmath407 .",
    "thus , when we decompose fields in harmonics on this space in the process of kaluza - klein reduction , the multiplets obtained fall into representations of @xmath433 .",
    "but @xmath434 , so both the theories have the same r - symmetry group .",
    "further , because of conformal invariance , the gauge theory has 16 conformal supercharges in addition to its 16 regular supercharges ; this agrees with the 32 supercharges of the gravity theory on ads@xmath424 .",
    "let us return to the issue of how to compare quantities in the two dual theories .",
    "let @xmath23 be the ads space , and @xmath435 its boundary .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a scalar field , the dilaton @xmath92 , present in the string theory .",
    "if we specify the value @xmath436 of @xmath92 on the boundary @xmath435 , then we can solve for @xmath92 in the interior of @xmath23 and compute the action @xmath437 of supergravity on this solution .",
    "the field @xmath92 , on the other hand , will be dual to an operator in the yang - mills theory , and in this case symmetries fix this operator to be @xmath438 .",
    "the duality relation is e^-s^_sugra[_b ]  =  _ da   e^-s_ym+d_b()tr f^2 ( ) _ da  e^-s_ym .",
    "[ eq : adsmain ] here @xmath439 represents the path integral over the gauge theory variables . the action on the left - hand side is a string action in general , but at the leading order it can be replaced by the supergravity action .    using the above relation",
    ", it is possible in principle to compute @xmath300-point correlation functions from supergravity and compare the results to calculations in the gauge theory .",
    "the gravity theory is simple ( perturbative classical supergravity to lowest order ) when @xmath187 is large ( loops of gravity are suppressed by @xmath440 ) and @xmath419 is large ( because then the ads space has a large radius , and stringy corrections , which depend on @xmath441 , can be ignored to leading order ) .",
    "thus it is difficult to compare results on the gravity side with explicit computations in the yang - mills theory , which has a well - known treatment of the large-@xmath187 limit but no simple way to handle a regime with @xmath442 .",
    "however , supersymmetry protects the values of some quantities from changing when the coupling is varied , and here agreement is indeed found .",
    "thus , anomalous dimensions of chiral operators @xcite and three - point functions of chiral operators @xcite are found to have the same value when computed from the gauge theory or from the gravity dual using equation  [ eq : adsmain ] . for quantities that are not protected in this fashion ,",
    "the gravity calculation gives a prediction for the strongly coupled gauge theory .",
    "examples of such predictions are the potential between external quarks placed in the gauge theory @xcite , four - point correlation functions , and anomalous dimensions of composite operators ( which can be deduced from the four - point functions ) @xcite .",
    "if one considers the gauge theory at a finite temperature by compactifying the `` time '' direction , then one obtains a nonsupersymmetric theory with a discrete spectrum of glueball states @xcite . in this case",
    ", the strong coupling calculation has no direct physical meaning , and only a weak coupling calculation would give the true glueball masses ( the coupling flows with scale after supersymmetry is broken ; with supersymmetry intact , it does not , and each value of the coupling gives a different well - defined theory ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a surprising agreement of the qualitative features of the glueball spectrum between the gravity calculation and lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence has been studied extensively over the past two years [ see @xcite for review ] . this section explains how this correspondence illustrates another important property of holography that is in fact its very essence : the bekenstein bound @xcite .",
    "a general argument states that in any theory of gravity , the total entropy @xmath22 of anything in a large box of volume @xmath249 and surface area @xmath443 is bounded by s , [ eq : holone ] where @xmath444 is newton s constant .",
    "numerical constants are ignored in this relation .",
    "the form of this bound appears surprising , since in the absence of gravity we know that entropy is an extensive quantity and should scale as @xmath249 .",
    "however , the result follows from the existence of black holes .",
    "suppose we start with a state whose entropy is bigger than this bound , but whose energy is smaller than the mass of a black hole that fills the entire box .",
    "then we slowly add matter , increasing the energy . at some stage",
    ", gravitational collapse takes over and a black hole is formed , which then continues to grow until it fills up the box .",
    "we know that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon measured in units of newton s constant",
    ". however , for this black hole , the area of the horizon is the same as the area of the box @xmath443 , i.e.  the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : holone ] .",
    "thus , we have managed to decrease the entropy in this process and hence have violated the second law .",
    "t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite have proposed a radical interpretation of the holographic bound ( equation  [ eq : holone ] ) , namely , a @xmath445-dimensional theory of gravity should be equivalent to a @xmath34-dimensional theory that lives on the boundary of space , and this @xmath34-dimensional theory must have one degree of freedom per planck area . if this is true , the bekenstein bound naturally follows .",
    "we have seen that supergravity in ads@xmath405 is dual to a strongly coupled large-@xmath187 yang - mills theory in @xmath412 dimensions .",
    "is it then true that the latter has one degree of freedom per planck area ?",
    "this is indeed true @xcite . in the ads@xmath405 metric ( equation  [ eq : tbthreea ] ) the boundary is at @xmath446 and continuum yang - mills theory living on this boundary",
    "is dual to supergravity in the whole space .",
    "but suppose we impose an infrared cutoff at @xmath447 .",
    "then it turns out that supergravity in the region @xmath448 is dual to a yang - mills theory with a position space ultraviolet cutoff @xmath449 .",
    "in fact , renormalization group flows of the gauge theory become motion in the fifth dimension .",
    "consider a large patch of this boundary of coordinate size @xmath257 ( in terms of the @xmath450 coordinates ) .",

    "[ eq : holothree ] using the expression for @xmath84 in equation  [ eq : tbtwo ] and the fact that the 5-dimensional newton s constant @xmath252 is given by @xmath451 , we see that ~n^2 l^3 z_0 ^ 3 .",
    "[ eq : holofour ] now the yang - mills theory has @xmath189 degrees of freedom per unit cell .",
    "this is manifest at weak coupling , but the result for the entropy of near - extremal 3-branes shows that this must also be true in strong coupling .",
    "furthermore , the cutoff of this theory is precisely @xmath452 .",
    "thus , the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : holofour ] is indeed the number of degrees of freedom in this cutoff yang - mills theory .",
    "this shows that the gauge theory ",
    "supergravity duality provides a concrete demonstration of the bekenstein bound .",
    "another example of the holographic connection is provided by the near - horizon geometry of the d1-d5 system .",
    "this spacetime is ads@xmath453 @xcite , where @xmath454 is either @xmath250 or @xmath455 on which the five branes are wrapped .",
    "the ads@xmath456 is made up of time , the transverse radial coordinate @xmath236 , and @xmath235 .",
    "the boundary theory is once again a superconformal field theory .",
    "however , this is no longer a gauge theory but rather the low - energy theory of the d1-d5 system discussed in the previous sections .",
    "once again , the symmetries of the bulk agree with the symmetries of the conformal field theory . furthermore , 5d black holes obtained by putting in some momentum now become the banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black holes of 3-dimensional gravity .",
    "in fact , recently the holographic connection has been used to understand the properties of the d1-d5 system . details of this development are supplied elsewhere @xcite .      unfortunately , despite these agreements between the two dual descriptions , we do not yet understand the explicit map that relates the gauge theory variables to the gravity variables",
    ". there is , in fact , an earlier example of holography : @xmath268-dimensional string theory .",
    "this theory has a nonperturbative definition in terms of quantum mechanics of @xmath190 matrices .",
    "one starts with the action @xmath457 $ ] , noting that when the matrix is large , there is a critical form for the potential in which successive terms in the loop expansion are comparable .",
    "the theory can be written in terms of @xmath458 , the density of eigenvalues of the matrix @xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "the extra dimension @xmath459 ( which is the space of eigenvalues ) becomes continuous and the collective field @xmath458 becomes a smooth field in @xmath278 dimensions .",
    "remarkably , in terms of appropriate variables , these two dimensions ( which emerged in totally different ways ) exhibit a local lorentz invariance @xcite , though in the presence of a background that breaks the full symmetry . in fact , at the critical point the loop diagrams of the matrix model generate discretizations of an oriented world sheet with dynamical world sheet metric and one scalar field .",
    "the usual quantization of noncritical string theory then converts the scale on the world sheet to an extra dimension in target space @xcite , resulting in a @xmath268-dimensional field theory .",
    "furthermore , renormalization group flow on the world sheet is related to motion in this extra target space direction @xcite",
    ".    it would be interesting if the gauge theory in @xmath412 dimensions acquired extra dimensions in a similar manner to map onto string theory in 10 dimensions .",
    "so far , such an approach has not succeeded , despite several attempts .",
    "the progress of string theory over the past few years has been truly remarkable .",
    "consistent quantization of the string forced us to consider a 10-dimensional supersymmetric theory .",
    "within such a theory , one discovers branes as solitonic states .",
    "regarding such solitons as elementary quanta turns out to be a duality transformation , and such duality maps unify all the five perturbative quantizations of the string , as well as 11-dimensional supergravity .",
    "there is no room for any free parameters in the theory , although many solutions of the field equations appear equally acceptable at first sight , and we do not yet know which to choose to describe the low - energy physics of the world that we see around us .",
    "the results on black holes have provided a striking validation of this entire structure .",
    "the entropy of black holes can be deduced from robust thermodynamic arguments , using just the classical properties of the black hole metric and gedanken experiments with low - density quantum matter .",
    "a correct quantum theory of gravity should reproduce this entropy by a count of allowed microstates , and string theory yields the correct microscopic entropy of extremal and near - extremal holes ( the only cases in which we know how to compute with some confidence ) .",
    "further , interaction with these microscopic degrees of freedom yields a unitary description of black hole absorption and hawking emission for low - energy quanta from near - extremal holes ( again this is the case in which we may compute with some confidence ) , thus suggesting that black holes can be unified into physics without having to modify basic principles of quantum mechanics or statistical physics . in no other route that has been attempted for quantizing gravity",
    "has it been possible to arrive at a value for black hole entropy ; the power of supersymmetry and our understanding of the nonperturbative features of string theory have allowed us to extract more than just the perturbative physics of graviton scattering .    what about the information issue in black hole evaporation ?",
    "the derivation of unitary low - energy hawking radiation from microstates certainly gives a strong indication on the information _ question , _",
    "i.e.  that information in the matter falling into the hole is not lost but is recovered in the radiation that emerges .",
    "but it is fair to say that we do not yet have a good understanding of the information _ paradox . _",
    "the paradox presents us with one way of computing hawking radiation , via the foliation of spacetime depicted in figure  1 , and this radiation process appears to be nonunitary .",
    "the paradox then challenges us to point out which of the assumptions that went into the calculations were wrong .",
    "it now appears reasonable that there are nonlocalities in quantum gravity that can extend beyond planck scale .",
    "indeed holography , and in particular the maldacena conjecture , requires that the degrees of freedom in a volume be encoded by degrees of freedom at the surface of that volume , so we must give up naive ways of thinking about locality .",
    "but we do not yet understand in detail the mechanism of this nonlocality , and in particular we lack an explicit description in string theory of the foliation in figure  1 .",
    "these gaps in our understanding are probably linked to our lack of an adequate language to understand the variables of string theory in a way that is not based on perturbation around a given background . in recent years",
    "matrix theory @xcite has attempted such a formulation , but our understanding is still somewhat primitive .",
    "it thus appears that most of the progress in understanding quantum gravity and the structure of spacetime is yet to come , and string theory should be an exciting field in the years ahead .    30 misner c , thorne w , wheeler j. _ gravitation .",
