    "the past decade has witnessed the advent of metamaterials that are capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves in an unprecedented way - for example , by controlling permittivity and permeability of materials .",
    "exotic properties have been demonstrated including negative refractive index  @xcite , super lens  @xcite and cloaking  @xcite .",
    "more recently , metasurfaces , two - dimensional ( 2d ) counterparts of metamaterials , have shown the ability of fully controlling the polarization , amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves  @xcite .",
    "distinct from thick optical components , such as lenses , which rely solely on phase accumulations along the optical path , metasurfaces utilize the abrupt phase shift at the interface produced by localized resonances . with a full phase modulation of electromagnetic waves ,",
    "arbitrary wavefront manipulations can be achieved and new functionalities have been demonstrated , including flat lens  @xcite , anomalous reflection or refraction  @xcite and hologram  @xcite .",
    "a full ( 2@xmath0 ) phase modulation is usually required for efficient wavefront control and it is desirable to have a constant amplitude at the same time . in general , tunable resonant metamaterials",
    "are utilized to produce a continuous full phase modulation .",
    "common ways to create tunable metamaterials include changing the geometries of metamaterials , modifying their surrounding media , and manipulating the coupling between adjacent metamaterials .",
    "in particular , numerous works on tunable metamaterials have been carried out at the thz range where natural materials do not interact strongly with thz waves  @xcite .",
    "for instance , microelectromechanical ( mems ) based tunable thz metamaterials have demonstrated large tunability and the potential to produce highly integrated thz devices  @xcite .",
    "tunability in liquid crystals based metamaterials have also been demonstrated by applying an external voltage or changing the temperature of the device  @xcite . manipulating the coupling between adjacent metamaterial layers",
    "are experimentally shown to be an effective way to achieve large tunability in the thz regime  @xcite .",
    "however , those tunable metamaterials only focus on frequency tunability and can not achieve large phase modulation .    to achieve a 2@xmath0 phase modulation ,",
    "three different approaches are primarily used .",
    "the first approach relies on cross - polarization to impose a 2@xmath0 phase shift in the transmitted waves , which usually lead to a low working efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the second way is to use dielectric huygens surfaces by overlapping electric and magnetic resonances to produce a 2@xmath0 phase shift with high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use a metallic ground plane and one resonator separated by a dielectric spacer  @xcite . due to the intrinsic lorentz - like resonance response ,",
    "the phase shift produced by one resonance is limited to @xmath0 radians . by including a metallic ground plane an additional phase",
    "is added to cover the full 2@xmath0 range in the vicinity of the resonance . by working in reflection , higher efficiency",
    "is generally expected .    in real - world applications , it is crucial to implement metasurfaces with a dynamic phase tunability .",
    "however , so far , most metasurfaces are static since they tune the whole metasurface uniformly  @xcite , which eliminates the advantage of having gradient metasurfaces .",
    "the challenge of having a dynamic tunability for metasurfaces mainly comes from fabrication difficulties to control each discrete resonator separately .",
    "the emerging 2d material graphene is suitable for building 2d metasurfaces with a dynamic phase modulation .",
    "particularly , graphene behaves like a metal in the thz range and its conductivity can be tuned by applying an external voltage  @xcite .",
    "this special property has generated a lot of interest to build graphene based tunable metamaterials  @xcite . in the previous work ,",
    "we have proposed a metasurface based on double graphene resonator in one unit cell , which can effectively focus different thz wavelengths into the same spot  @xcite . in this article",

    "the one atom thick graphene layer has shown strong metallic behavior at the thz regime .",
    "its surface conductivity is mainly determined by intraband transition and is evaluated by  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the elementary charge , @xmath7 is the temperature , @xmath8 is the angular frequency , @xmath9 is the fermi level , @xmath10 is a phenomenological scattering rate , @xmath11 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath12 is the reduced planck s constant .",
    "the fermi level can be changed by electrical gating or chemical doping , which gives great freedom to implement tunable conductivity .",
    "several works on graphene based metasurfaces have been reported  @xcite .",
    "previous works focused on tm excited plasmonic resonances in infinitely long graphene ribbons - due to the finite loss of graphene , only a maximum of 320@xmath2 phase modulation was achieved  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the large phase modulation is only achieved in the resonance vicinity , which limits its working frequency range .",
    "the configuration of having infinitely long graphene ribbons can not be extended to 2d wavefront control . to avoid those limitations",
    ", we propose to use two graphene long / short - strip resonators ( tglsr ) as the building block .",
    "two resonances are excited by having two different graphene long / short - strip resonators in one unit cell .",
    "since the two resonances are determined by the fermi level of each graphene strip , two independently controllable fermi levels are available for tuning the metasurface , which extend the 2@xmath0 phase modulation to a large frequency range .",
    "although the fermi levels of graphene can be tuned by chemical doping , using gating voltage is the only practical way to change fermi levels of graphene dynamically .",
    "fermi levels ( @xmath13 ) of graphene can be tuned by modifying the local carrier density - this is achieved , for example , by applying an external voltage  @xcite @xmath14 , the total carrier density @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the residual carrier concentration induced by density fluctuations caused by charged impurities near the dirac point and is varied across different graphene samples , @xmath17 is the gate capacitance which is determined by the specific electrode configuration , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the charge neutral point where numbers of electrons and holes are equal , @xmath20 is the applied external voltages . it is noted that @xmath19 is highly dependent on different graphene samples , e.g. @xmath21 in one graphene sample and it is moved to much higher value of @xmath22 after chemical doping  @xcite . to determine the actual voltage @xmath20 for the corresponding fermi levels ,",
    "fitting parameters from experimental results are needed  @xcite , and the reported values have been varied from several volts  @xcite to hundreds of volts  @xcite which can be affected by the specific graphene samples , dielectric thickness and properties , and electrode configurations . in order to avoid complicating the underlying physics and not overwhelming readers , we have decided to use fermi levels instead of voltages in the text , which is a normal practice in various studies  @xcite .",

    "more importantly , the two plasmon resonances are determined by their own fermi levels , which effectively gives two independent variables with the capability of being controlled by applying external voltages .",
