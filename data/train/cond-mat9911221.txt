    "the number of states per spin , @xmath4 , is indeed restricted to integer values in such simulations . in this paper , we therefore use a rather different approach already used by different authors  .",
    "this technique is based on the fortuin - kasteleyn graph representation   which enables tm calculations   where @xmath4 enters as a parameter that can take non integer values .",

    "this statement follows from the    numerical evidence that the scaling dimension of the average spin - spin    correlation function , as well as those of higher moments or typical    behaviour do not depend on the details of the probability    distribution , provided that the computations are performed at the    disordered fixed point given by the maximum condition of the central    charge .",
    "the exponent of the average correlation function is    furthermore in very good agreement with theoretical results using    perturbative conformal field theory available in the literature .",
    "ii ) : :    the question of a possible breaking of replica symmetry is also    considered and the numerical data strongly support the absence of    replica symmetry breaking .",
    "the problem is investigated through the    comparison of the scaling dimension of the second moment of the    correlation function , which is compared to perturbative results    obtained within both schemes .",
    "although previous numerical results    ( using monte carlo simulations ) which led to similar conclusions were    already reported at @xmath10 , we believe that our study is    conclusive , since it extends the work to other non integer values of    @xmath4 .",
    "iii ) : :    the multiscaling behaviour of the spin - spin correlation function is    investigated .",
    "the exponential decay of the moments of the correlation    functions along very long strips is used to deduce numerically the    corresponding critical exponents .",
    "these dimensions continuously depend    on the moment order , as a consequence of multifractality .",
    "they are    furthermore very weakly dependent of the probability distribution . at    low moment order ,",
    "the numerical results are furthermore in agreement    with a perturbative result obtained within the replica symmetry    scheme .",
    "when the moment order increases , a discrepancy is observed ,    resulting from the lack of validity of the perturbation expansion , and    possibly of a numerical determination which becomes less precise .",
    "the    multifractal function , given by the legendre transform of the set of    independent scaling dimensions is also computed for different values    of @xmath4 .",
    "it is shown that this universal function    completely determines the shape of the correlation function    probability distribution .",
    "the main result of this paper is probably to show that universality in random systems has to be understood in the sense of a critical behaviour which does not depend on the choice of the probability distribution ( this is only true up to some extent , since special distributions which do not obey the central limit theorem , like levy flights , would certainly lead to different results ) . by critical behaviour , here we mean the behaviour of all the moments of a physical quantity , entirely contained in the multifractal function or the correlation function probability distribution but we want to stress that lack of self - averaging does not imply absence of universality .",
    "we also note that logarithmic corrections were recently reported in the disconnected energy - energy correlations function   and that disorder was shown to induce non - vanishing cross - correlations between spin - spin and energy - energy moments  .",
    "the multiscaling of energy correlations has been studied very recently by j.l .",
