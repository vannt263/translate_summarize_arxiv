    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 of the real scalar field , in common with those corresponding to most models of classical matter , with @xmath1 . ] obeys the dominant energy condition ( dec ) : for any future - directed timelike vector @xmath2 , the contraction @xmath3 is itself timelike and future - directed .",
    "this may also be stated as the inequality @xmath4 for all pairs of future - directed timelike vectors @xmath2 and @xmath5 . in the special case @xmath6",
    ", we recover the weak energy condition ( wec ) , @xmath7 , i.e. , the energy density is nonnegative according to any observer .    in classical general relativity , energy conditions of this type play a key role , guaranteeing the stability of gravitational collapse ( singularity theorems  @xcite ) , the stability of minkowski space as a ` ground state ' of the theory ( positive mass theorems  @xcite ) and also excluding certain exotic causal structures ( see e.g. , hawking s discussion of chronology protection  @xcite ) .",
    "however , as has been known for a long time  @xcite , the wec ( and hence dec ) are violated in quantum field theory .",
    "it is easy to give a simple proof in minkowski space : suppose that @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is now a smooth timelike vector field , and let @xmath9 be a nonnegative smooth function of compact support .",
    "we need assume only that the smeared field @xmath10 is ( essentially ) self - adjoint on the hilbert space of the theory and that there is a vacuum state @xmath11 in the operator domain of @xmath10 such that @xmath12 but which is not annihilated by @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath13 . writing the spectral measure of @xmath10 as @xmath14 ,",
    "these last two properties tell us that the probability measure @xmath15 on @xmath16 has zero expectation , but that its support is not simply the set @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly @xmath10 must have some negative spectrum . for small @xmath18 .",
    "] clearly the same argument applies in many circumstances , and for observables other than energy density .",
    "thus , the classical pointwise energy conditions are simply incompatible with the structures of quantum field theory .",
    "further analysis of particular models shows that the pointwise energy density is typically unbounded from below as a function of the quantum state , and this can be proved for all theories with a suitable scaling limit  @xcite .",
    "this fact raises questions concerning the applicability of the singularity , positive mass and chronology protection results where quantised matter is concerned .",
    "many authors have also sought to exploit quantum fields to support metrics ( including wormhole or warp drive models ) which require wec - violating matter distributions .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether the classical energy conditions are irretrievably lost , or whether one can identify some remnant in the quantum theory .",
    "this contribution will discuss a promising candidate : a group of results known as quantum energy inequalities ( qeis ) , and will in particular focus on their emerging connections with other well - known stability conditions in quantum field theory , namely the microlocal spectrum condition , passivity and nuclearity .",
    "the hope is that , by unravelling these connections , further insight is provided into the nature of quantised matter and its ( gravitational ) stability .",
    "it is a particular pleasure to dedicate this contribution to jacques bros , in view of his influential contributions to both microlocal analysis and the description of thermal behaviour in quantum field theory .",
    "as mentioned above , the pointwise energy conditions are unavoidably and severely violated in quantum field theory .",
    "however , observations at individual spacetime points are not physically achievable in any case ( owing to the uncertainty principle ) , so it is more natural to consider weighted averages of the stress - energy tensor over a spacetime volume .",
    "let @xmath19 be a class of second - rank tensors on spacetime , and @xmath20 a class of states of the theory .",
    "if , for each @xmath21 , the averaged expectation values @xmath22 are bounded from below as @xmath23 runs over @xmath20 , we say that the theory obeys a _ quantum energy inequality _",
    "( qei ) with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "one generally aims to find an explicit lower bound @xmath24 $ ] so that the qei can be written as an inequality @xmath25 \\qquad \\forall \\omega\\in{{\\mathcal{s}}}\\;.\\ ] ] where @xmath19 consists of tensors of a particular form e.g. , @xmath26 or @xmath27 for timelike vector fields @xmath2 , @xmath5 , we use more specific terms , e.g. , quantum weak energy inequality ( qwei ) or quantum dominated energy inequality ( qdei ) .",
    "of course a similar approach could be adopted other quantities of interest .    for the most part , qeis have been developed for averages along timelike curves , rather than over spacetime volumes , in which case the weights may be thought of as being singularly supported on a curve . by threading a spacetime volume by worldlines , these bounds imply the existence of spacetime - averaged qeis , which may also be obtained directly , as sketched below .",
    "it is known that compactly supported weighted averages over spacelike hypersurfaces  @xcite or null lines  @xcite are not generally bounded from below , except for two - dimensional conformal fields  @xcite .",
    "qeis were first proposed by ford  @xcite , who realised that suitable bounds of this type would be sufficient to prevent macroscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics arising from negative energy phenomena in quantum field theory .",
    "they have since been established for the free klein ",
    "gordon  @xcite , dirac  @xcite , maxwell  @xcite and proca  @xcite quantum fields in both flat and curved spacetimes , the rarita ",
    "schwinger field in minkowski space  @xcite , and also for general unitary positive - energy conformal field theories in two - dimensional minkowski space  @xcite .",
    "we will not give a full history of the development of the subject , referring the reader to the recent reviews  @xcite . to give a flavour of the sort of results obtained , we give an example in which the energy density of a scalar field of mass @xmath28 is averaged along the inertial trajectory @xmath29 in minkowski space .",
    "it can be obtained by elementary means  @xcite or as a special case of the rigorous result  @xcite .",
    "set @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "then the qwei @xmath32:= -\\frac{1}{16{\\pi}^{3}}\\int_0^\\infty \\d u\\,u^4",
    "\\vartheta(u - m ) |\\widehat{g}(u)|^2\\ ; , \\label{eq : feqi}\\ ] ] holds for all hadamard states @xmath33 ( see below ) and smooth compactly supported @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 denotes the fourier transform etc . ] and @xmath36 is the heaviside function .",
    "the bound is finite , owing to the rapid decay of @xmath35 .",
    "in fact the bound given in  @xcite is slightly tighter than this , but   will suffice for our present purposes .    for later reference ,",
    "let us note the scaling behaviour of the bound  . replacing @xmath34 by @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 controls the ` spread ' of the weight , one may show that @xmath39 = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cl }   o(\\tau^{-4 } ) & { \\rm as}~\\tau\\to0^+\\\\ o(\\tau^{-\\infty } ) & { \\rm as}~\\tau\\to\\infty\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] for @xmath40 , where the notation @xmath41 indicates faster - than - inverse - polynomial decay . in the massless case",
    ", it turns out that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the @xmath44 limit , which corresponds to sampling at a point , is consistent with the pointwise unboundedness below of the energy density . for intermediate scales ,",
    "the qwei allows for a limited violation of the classical wec ; bounds of this type therefore appear to be the natural remnant of the wec in quantum field theory .",
    "we mention briefly that related bounds appear elsewhere in quantum field theory  @xcite and quantum mechanics  @xcite ; qeis have also been used to place constraints on exotic spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "the work described in this section , conducted with verch  @xcite and building on earlier work  @xcite , uncovers a circle of connections between stability conditions operating at three different scales : the microscopic ( hadamard condition / microlocal spectrum condition ) , mesoscopic ( qeis ) and macroscopic ( thermodynamic stability , expressed by the notion of passivity  @xcite ) .",
    "each connection takes the form of a rigorous theorem ; the reader should be cautioned , however , that the conclusions and hypotheses of successive links do not match perfectly .",
    "moreover , two of the links ( mesoscopic to macroscopic , and macroscopic to microscopic ) are obtained in greater generality than the particular setting of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes , while the microscopic to mesoscopic link is currently known only for particular models of quantum field theory .",
    "thus the existence of these connections should be regarded as indicative of a close relationship between these three stability conditions , rather than of proving their equivalence . in part",
    ", this work gives a precise expression to ford s original insight  @xcite , that bounds of qei type would suffice to prevent macrosopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "stability of quantum field theory at the microscopic scale is ( partly ) expressed by the hadamard condition , which requires that the singular structure of the two - point function takes a form determined for nearby points by the local geometry  @xcite of spacetime .",
    "as first shown by radzikowski  @xcite , this may be reformulated as a condition on the wave - front set  @xcite of the two - point function .- point functions were given in  @xcite . for non -",
    "initiates : the wave - front set @xmath45 of a distribution @xmath46 on a manifold @xmath47 is a subset of the cotangent bundle @xmath48 which encodes the singular structure of @xmath46 .",
    "singularities are classified in terms of the ( lack of ) decay of local fourier transforms of @xmath46 in different directions . ] by passing to a hilbert space representation , however , one obtains a very simple formulation of the hadamard condition  @xcite ( cf . also  @xcite ) : a state of the scalar field on @xmath49 ) is hadamard if and only if it may be represented by a vector @xmath33 in some hilbert space representation of the theory so that @xmath50 is a vector - valued distribution whose wave - front set obeys @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the field and @xmath53 is the bundle of past - pointing causal covectors ( our signature convention is @xmath54 ) .",
    "this has the following practical upshot .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is smooth and compactly supported within some coordinate patch , with coordinates @xmath55 so that @xmath56 is future - pointing and timelike .",
    "let @xmath57 be any closed cone in @xmath58 consisting of @xmath59 such that the covector field @xmath60 is nowhere causal and past - directed on the coordinate patch",
    ". in particular , @xmath57 could be the half - space @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath62 is of rapid decay in @xmath57 ; that is , it decays more rapidly than any inverse polynomial in the euclidean norm of @xmath59 as @xmath63 in @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , the same is true if @xmath9 is replaced by a partial differential operator with smooth coefficients compactly supported in the coordinate patch .",
    "microlocal formulations of the hadamard condition are also known for the dirac  @xcite , maxwell and proca fields  @xcite .",
    "they may be regarded as local remnants of the spectrum condition , i.e. , the minkowski space requirement that the joint spectrum of the generators @xmath64 of spacetime translations should lie in the future causal cone .",
    "we now show how qeis may be derived from the hadamard condition , using an argument based on that of  @xcite . the classical klein ",
    "gordon field @xmath65 obeying @xmath66 on spacetime @xmath67 has stress - energy tensor @xmath68 and obeys the wec and dec because the relevant contractions of @xmath0 can be decomposed as sums of squares .",
    "let us therefore consider  as representing the most general classical energy condition  any tensor field @xmath69 for which @xmath70 where the @xmath71 are finitely many linear partial differential operators ( possibly of degree zero ) with smooth real coefficients of compact support .",
    "clearly @xmath72 for classical fields",
    "for simplicity , assume that the supports of the @xmath71 are contained within a single coordinate patch of @xmath73 writing the coordinates as @xmath55 and assuming as above that @xmath56 is future - pointing and timelike .",
    "write also @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be a fixed hadamard reference state . defining the stress - energy tensor @xmath76 by point - splitting and normal ordering with respect to @xmath75",
    ", we have @xmath77 for any hadamard state @xmath33 , where @xmath78\\ ] ] is smooth ( owing to the common singularity structure of hadamard two - point functions ) and symmetric ( because two - point functions have a state - independent antisymmetric part ) .",
    "thus we may write @xmath79 where we have used the fourier representation of the dirac-@xmath80 and symmetry of @xmath81 to restrict the outer domain of integration .",
    "now the inner integral is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and so we obtain the qei @xmath84 the left - hand side of which depends on the reference state @xmath75 , but not on @xmath33 .",
    "the key point now is that the microlocal form of the hadamard condition entails that @xmath85 is of rapid decay in the half - space @xmath86 .",
    "thus the integral on the right - hand side of   exists and is finite .",
    "we conclude that the real linear scalar field obeys a qei with respect to the class of weights delineated by   and the class of hadamard states .",
    "the same argument would apply to a suitable class of adiabatic states  @xcite in which one replaces the smooth wave - front set by a wave - front set modulo sobolev regularity .",
    "note that this qei applies to the normal ordered stress - energy tensor , rather than the renormalised tensor . by",
    "adding a term to the both sides which depends on the renormalised stress - energy tensor in state @xmath75 and certain other smooth local geometric terms , this defect can be remedied .",
    "( the bound is then typically not a ` closed form ' expression . )",
    "pusz and woronowicz introduced the notion of passivity in the following way  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 be a @xmath88-dynamical system ; that is , @xmath89 is a @xmath88-algebra , which we think of as the algebra of observables for some quantum system , while @xmath90 is the map of evolution through time @xmath91 corresponding to the undisturbed evolution of the system , and has the group property @xmath92 .",
    "provided @xmath90 is strongly continuous ( i.e. , the map @xmath93 is continuous for each @xmath94 ) we may define the generator @xmath80 of the evolution by @xmath95 for the space of @xmath96 for which the derivative exists ( in @xmath89 ) , which we denote @xmath97 .",

    "we also have @xmath100 for any @xmath101 .",
    "the motivating idea of  @xcite is to understand thermodynamic stability of the dynamical system with respect to cyclical changes of external conditions .",
    "one might think of a box of gas which is compressed and then allowed to return to its initial volume . in the current setting , a cyclical process occuring during time interval @xmath102 $ ] may be modelled by a perturbed time evolution @xmath103 satisfying @xmath104\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a differentiable assignment of a self - adjoint element @xmath107 to each time @xmath101 , and @xmath108 for @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "suppose the system is initially in state @xmath23 .",
    "then the work performed by the external agent driving the cyclical process is @xmath110 and the state @xmath23 is said to be _ passive _ if @xmath111 for any @xmath112 , i.e. , if no cyclical process can extract energy from the system .",
    "thus passivity isolates the property characteristic of the second law of thermodynamics in kelvin s formulation , where we think of the system as a thermal reservoir from which we attempt to extract work .",
    "pusz and woronowicz proved    a state @xmath23 is passive if and only if @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the identity - connected component of the unitary elements of @xmath89 .",
    "particular examples of passive states are provided by ground and kms states , or mixtures thereof .",
    "a key feature of passivity is that it introduces a definite thermodynamic ` arrow of time ' .",
    "let us now see how passivity may be obtained from qeis , giving a simplified and slightly modified version of the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "we begin by introducing an abstract formulation of qeis for @xmath88-dynamical systems , to which end we must first provide a notion of the energy density .",
    "accordingly , we assume that @xmath89 is the algebra of observables of a system in a spacetime of the form @xmath116 , for @xmath117 compact and riemannian , with volume measure @xmath118 .",
    "the evolution @xmath90 corresponds to time - translations on spacetime and is assumed to be strongly continuous with generator @xmath80 .    as one would not expect the energy density to exist for all states",
    ", we must specify a smaller class of states and a class of unitary elements large enough to be dense in @xmath119 , in a suitable sense , but which preserves the state space .",
    "accordingly , let @xmath120 be a @xmath121-subalgebra of @xmath89 with @xmath122 , and is large enough that any element of @xmath123 may be approximated arbitrarily well by unitary elements of @xmath120 with respect to the graph norm of @xmath80 .",
    "that is , to any @xmath124 there is a sequence of unitaries @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath20 be a convex set of states of @xmath89 which is closed under operations in @xmath120 . and",

    ", expressions of the form @xmath135 should be taken as a convenient shorthand : what is more precisely meant is the following .",
    "let @xmath139 be the subspace of continuous linear functionals on @xmath89 generated by functionals of the form @xmath140 ( for @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) .",
    "then the energy density is a linear map @xmath141 , and our shorthand notation @xmath135 means @xmath142 .",
    "we are now in a position to define a general type of qwei in this setting , by analogy with the result  .",

    "they then proved that strictly passive states obey the generalised microlocal spectrum condition : the key ingredient in their argument is that both ( strict ) passivity and the microlocal spectrum conditions share a common arrow of time .",

    "we define the space of hadamard states @xmath224 of the full theory to consist of finite linear combinations of product states @xmath222 in which each @xmath225 and all but finitely many @xmath223 equal @xmath219 , and then define the total energy density as follows : for any @xmath226 and @xmath227 in @xmath224 we set @xmath228 ( noting that only finitely many terms contribute to the sum , and that each product involves only finitely many terms differing from unity ) and then extend by linearity to all @xmath229 .",
    "the left - hand side should be regarded as a quadratic form on @xmath224 , taking values in the space of smooth functions on spacetime ; clearly , any normal - ordered quantity could be treated in this way , and no constraints on the @xmath207 have been imposed . since the @xmath230th component of the full theory obeys the qwei   for each mass @xmath207 , @xmath231 for all hadamard states @xmath232 , the full theory obeys @xmath233 for any normalised @xmath234 .",
    "accordingly , polynomial growth of @xmath235 is sufficient for the theory to admit a worldline qwei with test - functions @xmath34 drawn from @xmath236 , and it is possible to show that it is a necessary and sufficient condition if certain scaling behaviour is required : grows faster than polynomially , one may still formulate qweis , but for weight functions with sufficiently rapid decay in fourier space . in particular",
    ", this would generally exclude compactly supported weights . ]",
    "consider a generalised free field with discrete mass spectrum described by @xmath211 .",
    "let @xmath237 .",
    "then the following are equivalent : + 1 ) @xmath214 as @xmath215 ; + 2 ) the generalised free field obeys the qwei   for arbitrary @xmath238 , and the bound has asymptotic behaviour of order @xmath239 as @xmath240 , if we replace @xmath34 by @xmath37 .",
    "the proof of this result will be reported elsewhere .",
    "an immediate corollary is that the existence of a qwei with polynomial scaling implies that the buchholz ",
    "wichmann nuclearity condition   is satisfied for any @xmath241 .",
    "all this raises two questions , which are being pursued in on - going work with porrmann and ojima .",
    "first , can we show that   implies that @xmath211 is polynomially bounded ?",
    "if so , we would have an equivalence between qweis and nuclearity for this model .",
    "this leads to the second question : can we understand the link at a deeper level , or is it merely a coincidence , with no more significance than that both are manifestations of the uncertainty principle ?",
    "a suitable understanding of this question might lead to a general framework for establishing qeis in general quantum field theories .",
    "part of the problem is to identify the right question , of course , and it may be that one or both of nuclearity or qeis need to be carefully ( re)phrased or even replaced .",
    "these questions also require consideration of lower bounds on nuclearity indices : here a potential stumbling block is the technical definition of many of the quantities appearing in discussions of nuclearity , which are therefore not easily amenable to direct calculation even in the simplest cases .",
    "indeed this provides pitfalls for the unwary , one of which we have recently noted  @xcite : in the mathematical literature there is a notion of @xmath242-nuclear map , whose definitions for @xmath243 and @xmath244 take rather different forms .",
    "although this difference has occasionally been noted in the physics literature  @xcite , one often finds the @xmath244 definition used for all @xmath242 .",
    "however , as we show in  @xcite , the corresponding nuclearity index would vanish identically for @xmath243 according to this definition !",
    "fortunately this confusion does not appear to have adverse consequences in the literature so far , but it serves as a warning .",
    "quantum energy inequalities are an expression of the uncertainty principle , and as such are deeply rooted within quantum theory .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that they have connections with other fundamental properties : unravelling these interconnections has the potential to deepen our understanding of the structure of quantum field theory and the nature of quantised matter .",
    "much remains to be done !"
