    "the subject of the present work is the study of @xmath12 meson interactions with the nuclear medium .",
    "it is closely related to one of the most important , so far unresolved problems in hadronic physics , of how hadron masses and interactions change within the nuclear medium .",
    "the in - medium properties of antikaons in dense nuclear matter have attracted considerable attention since the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson on the possibility of kaon condensation in dense matter @xcite and subsequent works offering related scenarios in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath13 , a @xmath14 quasi - bound state lying about 27  mev below the @xmath15 threshold , suggests that the @xmath14 interaction is strongly attractive , as demonstrated first in a vector - meson exchange model due to dalitz _",
    "et al . _",
    "this is consistent with low - energy @xmath14 scattering data @xcite as well as with the measured level shift of the @xmath16 state in the kaonic hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 , as a @xmath15 quasi - bound state , was also corroborated in the jlich meson exchange model @xcite , where the scalar @xmath18 and vector @xmath19 mesons act jointly to give strong attraction .",
    "subsequent chiral su(3 ) calculations showed that the @xmath20 coupled - channel @xmath21 interaction is sufficiently attractive to bind the @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for an update on such calculations see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1nucleus interaction , too , is strongly attractive , as deduced from analyses of strong - interaction level shifts and widths in kaonic atoms @xcite .",
    "these fits to kaonic - atom data are based on phenomenological density dependent optical potentials @xcite or on a relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach @xcite , yielding strongly attractive @xmath0nucleus potentials of depths 150200  mev . for an update see ref .",
    "in contrast , coupled - channel calculations using @xmath14 interactions constrained by chiral models and fitted to the low - energy @xmath14 scattering and reaction data result in shallower @xmath1nucleus potentials of depth in the range of 100150  mev @xcite . imposing a self - consistency requirement on the evaluation of the in - medium @xmath1nucleus potential , yields much shallower potentials of depth about 50  mev @xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained when the jlich meson - exchange model is used within a self - consistent coupled - channel calculation @xcite .",
    "a depth of about 80  mev is indicated by analyzing the enhanced near - threshold production of @xmath0 mesons in proton  nucleus collisions , in recent experiments by the kaos collaboration at gsi  @xcite ( and references cited therein to earlier nucleus - nucleus experiments ) .",
    "the @xmath1nuclear interaction is also strongly absorptive , due dominantly to the one - nucleon absorption reactions @xmath22 with approximately 100  mev ( @xmath23 ) and 180  mev ( @xmath24 ) energy release for the final hyperon @xmath25 .",
    "the strong absorptivity is confirmed by fits to kaonic - atom data @xcite .",
    "considerable interest in this field in recent years has focused on the question of possible existence of deeply bound @xmath1nuclear states , and whether such states are sufficiently narrow to allow unique experimental identification .",
    "kishimoto  @xcite , and akaishi and yamazaki @xcite , suggested to look for @xmath1nuclear states bound by over 100  mev , for which the dominant @xmath11 decay channel would become kinematically forbidden .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that multi-@xmath1 high - density nuclear clusters should also exist , providing perhaps a precursor stage to kaon condensation @xcite .",
    "several searches for @xmath1 deeply bound states have been subsequently made in kek @xcite , by the finuda collaboration in da@xmath26ne , frascati @xcite and at the ags , brookhaven @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of the observed spectra is ambiguous , as demonstrated by an alternative explanation of the ( allegedly @xmath27 ) peak observed in the back - to - back @xmath28 invariant mass distribution of @xmath29 reactions on @xmath30li and on @xmath2c @xcite in terms of quasi - free @xmath31 absorption and final - state interaction @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations of @xmath1nuclear bound states may be divided into two classes : ( i ) few - body calculations using a single - channel @xmath32-matrix or amd methodology  @xcite , and coupled - channel @xmath33 faddeev equations  @xcite which agree with refs .",
    "@xcite on @xmath27 being bound , although differing widely on the binding energy and width calculated for this lightest possible system ; ( ii ) dynamical rmf calculations @xcite which take into account the polarization of the nucleus owing to the strongly interacting @xmath1 meson , as well as the reduction of phase space available for the decay of the deeply bound @xmath1 meson .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite provide a lower limit of @xmath34  mev on the width of nuclear bound states for @xmath0 binding energy in the range @xmath35  mev .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold . in the first part we report on dynamical calculations of single-@xmath0 nuclear states within the relativistic mean field ( rmf )",
    "this part of the work deals with three items :    * effects due to the vector - meson @xmath36 and @xmath37 mean fields which were not included in our previous calculations @xcite are studied .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath36-meson mean field allows for a departure from @xmath38 nuclear cores for @xmath12nuclear states , and the introduction of the @xmath37-meson mean field allows for studying multi - strange @xmath12nuclear states . * the effect of @xmath6-wave gradient terms motivated by the @xmath39 @xmath7 resonance is studied by extending the rmf coupled equations in the simplest form .",
    "although the role of the @xmath14 @xmath6-wave interaction is marginal near threshold @xcite , it might become more important for deeply bound antikaons , owing to local variations in the nuclear densities induced by the antikaon @xcite . * following our previous work @xcite",
    ", we explore in more detail and rigor the absorptive part of the optical potential in the energy region where the dominant decay channel @xmath11 is closed .",
    "this is done by incorporating for the first time the @xmath8 channel , with threshold some 80  mev below the @xmath40 threshold , and by considering a @xmath10 density dependence for the two - nucleon absorption modes @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 dependence is more appropriate for the description of the two - nucleon nature of these absorption modes .    in the second part of this work we explore within the rmf methodology deeply bound multi-@xmath1 nuclear states , in order to study the behavior of the nuclear medium under the influence of increasing strangeness .",
    "the issue here is whether or not the binding energy per @xmath1 meson of multi-@xmath1 nuclear states increases significantly upon adding a large number of @xmath1 mesons , so that @xmath1 mesons provide the physical degrees of freedom for self - bound strange hadronic systems .",
    "kaon condensation in nuclear matter would occur beyond some threshold value of strangeness , if the binding energy per @xmath1 meson exceeds the combination @xmath41  mev ( in this paper we use @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 is the nucleon chemical potential .",
    "in such a case , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 hyperons would no longer combine macroscopically with nucleons to compose the more conventional kaon - free form of strange hadronic matter @xcite . in neutron stars ,",
    "the binding energy per @xmath1 meson necessary for the onset of kaon condensation is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electron chemical potential ( generally accepted to assume values of @xmath49  mev ) .",
    "the rmf approach was first applied to the study of kaon condensation in the mid 1990s , originally without considering a possible interplay with hyperons @xcite and then with hyperons included @xcite .",
    "this approach was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite to consider @xmath50 condensation in addition to @xmath0 condensation in neutron stars .",
    "recent calculations offer a wide range of interesting precursor phenomena to kaon condensation in both hadronic and quark sectors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and previous work cited therein ) .",
    "the present calculations may shed some light on the likelihood of a kaon - condensation scenario in nuclear matter .",

    "the generalization to nuclear systems with @xmath61 mesons is straightforward .",
    "whereas the dirac equation for nucleons is not explicitly affected by the addition of @xmath52 , the presence of @xmath0 mesons induces additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson ( mean ) fields : @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 denoting the scalar , vector and isovector nuclear densities , respectively , and with @xmath66 denoting the proton density . the @xmath0 density @xmath60 is given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "having dealt with the nuclear binding energy of @xmath0 mesons , in the next step we consider @xmath1 absorption in the nuclear medium , in order to evaluate the @xmath0 decay width @xmath90 . in our model , this is done by allowing the self energy @xmath83 to become complex and replacing @xmath91 . since the imaginary part of the self energy is not addressed by the traditional rmf approach , @xmath92 was taken from optical model phenomenology .",

    "once the antikaon is embedded in the nuclear medium , the attractive @xmath14 interaction compresses the nuclear core , thus increasing the nuclear density which leads to an increased @xmath1 width . on the other hand , the phase space available for decay products",

    "suppression factors multiplying @xmath92 were introduced , explicitly considering @xmath1 binding energy for the initial decaying state and assuming two - body final state kinematics .",
    "we first consider absorption on a single nucleon , leading to the following pionic decay modes : @xmath93 with thresholds about 100 mev and 180 mev , respectively , below the @xmath14 total mass .",

    "the right - hand spectrum displays further modification of the nucleon single - particle energies due to the @xmath137 coupling .",

    "we performed fully self - consistent dynamical calculations of @xmath12nuclear states for nuclear systems with one and several @xmath12 mesons within the rmf approach .",
    "we verified that the interaction of a @xmath16 @xmath0 meson with the @xmath36-meson mean field affects negligibly the @xmath0 binding energy .",
    "its main effect on the nucleon single particle energies is to partly cancel , and for the @xmath16 nucleon level even reverse the @xmath169 coulomb energy difference .",
    "for all nuclei and rmf parameterizations considered in the present work , the @xmath36-meson contribution slightly decreases the @xmath0 binding energy @xmath133 by less than about 5  mev for @xmath170  mev .",
    "similarly , the @xmath37-meson contribution in systems with several @xmath0 mesons reduces the @xmath0 binding energy by a few mev in this range of @xmath133 values .",
    "the calculations involving the @xmath6-wave interaction of the @xmath0 meson with a nucleus indicate that the @xmath6-wave interaction plays a secondary role for deeply bound @xmath0nuclear systems where the mean - field concept is acceptable .",
    "although the @xmath6-wave interaction by itself is too weak to cause nuclear binding , its contribution in the lightest ( carbon ) nucleus considered in the present work amounts to more than 10 mev and is certainly nonnegligible .",
    "since the effect of the @xmath6-wave interaction appears to increase upon decreasing the atomic number , it could play a primary role in deeply and tightly bound few - body @xmath0 systems .",
    "we found that the implementation of the @xmath144 decay channel in the single - nucleon absorption mode enhances the @xmath0 conversion width for @xmath0 binding energies @xmath171  mev .",
    "this enhancement is almost uniform for both linear and nonlinear parameterizations in all nuclei considered .",
    "the most remarkable contribution occurs for @xmath0 binding energies in the range @xmath172  mev where it reaches values of approximately 20  mev .",
    "the assumption of a @xmath10 density dependence for the @xmath149-absorption mode adds further conversion width especially to the deeply bound @xmath0nuclear states .",
    "the increase is particularly large for nonlinear parameterizations owing to the strong polarization effects affordable through the moderate value of nuclear incompressibility , as opposed to the highly unrealistic values in linear parameterizations .",
    "altogether , the results of these comprehensive calculations suggest that @xmath0 total decay widths for deeply bound @xmath0 nuclear states ( @xmath173  mev ) are substantial , @xmath174  mev .",
    "we also studied nuclear systems containing several antikaons .",
    "the nuclear and @xmath12 densities were found to behave quite regularly upon increasing the number of antikaons embedded in the nuclear medium .",
    "the calculations do not indicate any abrupt or substantial increase of the densities .",
    "the central nuclear densities in multi-@xmath0 @xmath175 nuclei and in multi-@xmath0 @xmath176 nuclei appear to saturate at about only 50% and 60% , respectively , higher values than the central nuclear densities in the corresponding systems with one antikaon .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath12 binding energy saturates upon increasing the number of @xmath12 mesons embedded in the nuclear medium .",
    "the heavier the nucleus is , the more antikaons it takes to saturate the binding energies , but even for @xmath176 the number required does not exceed approximately 10 .",
    "the saturated values of @xmath12 binding energies do not exceed the range of values 100200  mev considered normally as providing deep binding for one antikaon .",
    "this range of binding energies leaves antikaons in multi-@xmath177 nuclei comfortably above the range of energies where hyperons might be relevant .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that multi-@xmath177 nuclei may offer precursor phenomena in nuclear matter towards kaon condensation .",
    "this does not rule out that kaon condensation occurs in neutron stars where different constraints hold for the composition of matter .",
    "although we presented results for one particular choice of rmf model , the nl - sh model @xcite , the use of other realistic mean - field models supports these conclusions .",
