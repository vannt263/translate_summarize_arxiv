    "general relativity was proposed in 1915 .",
    "one of its predictions was the bending of light rays of stars in the gravitational field of the sun .",
    "this effect was verified observationally soon afterwards by dyson et al .  in 1920 and put , as a result , einstein s theory in the forefront of gravitational research .    within the framework of general relativity , a light ray can be extracted from classical electrodynamics in its _ geometrical optics _",
    "limit , i.e. , for wavelengths much smaller than the local curvature radius of space .",
    "accordingly , the bending of light can be understood as a result of a nontrivial refractive index of spacetime , see skrotskii et al .",
    "@xcite , due to the coupling of the electromagnetic field @xmath3 to the gravitational field @xmath4 .",
    "classically , we have in nature just these two fundamental fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the weak and the strong fields being confined to microphysical dimensions of @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the coupling of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is of foremost importance in classical physics .",
    "the conventional way that coupling is achieved is to display the maxwell - lorentz equations of vacuum electrodynamics in the ( flat ) minkowski world of special relativity theory in cartesian coordinates . for this purpose ,",
    "usually the formalism of tensor analysis ( ricci calculus ) is used , see @xcite : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the electromagnetic field strength , @xmath9 the electric 4-vector current , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 as the contravariant components of the metric . the commas in ( [ maxwell - l ] ) denote partial differentiation with respect to the local spacetime coordinates @xmath12 .    if we switch on _ gravity _ , the flat minkowski world becomes curved , the spacetime geometry now being a riemannian geometry with a variable metric @xmath13 of minkowskian signature @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling of the maxwell - lorentz set ( [ maxwell - l ] ) to gravity is now brought about by the _",
    "comma goes to semicolon rule _ , @xmath15 ; ( see @xcite ) , where the semicolon represents the covariant derivative @xmath16 with respect to the riemannian connection ( `` levi - civita connection '' ) : @xmath17 this translation rule from special to general relativity is also alluded to as _ minimal coupling _ with the additional understanding that the components of the metric in ( [ fcontra ] ) become spacetime dependent fields .",
    "the metric field @xmath13 , entering ( [ maxwell - l ; ] ) via ( [ fcontra ] ) and via the covariant derivatives , i.e. , via the semicolons , has to fulfill the einstein field equation , @xmath18 with @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the curvature and @xmath21 the material energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the coupled einstein - maxwell system describes correctly a wealth of experiments , in particular the gravitational bending of light , the gravitational redshift , the time delay of radar pulses in the gravitational field of the sun , and the gravitational lensing and microlensing of starlight in the gravitational field of galaxies .",
    "but in all these experiments , we study the propagation of light along null - geodesics in a prescribed ( and perhaps slowly varying ) gravitational field which is a solution of the einstein vacuum equation  and not of the _ electro_-vacuum equation",
    ". we could call this the _ non _ self - consistent einstein - maxwell theory . in the solar system , e.g. ,",
    "the schwarzschild metric is taken as solution of the einstein vacuum equation and the motion of a `` photon '' is described by the null geodesic equation on this background .",
    "a true novel effect of the einstein - maxwell theory would be , e.g. , the generation of electromagnetic waves by gravitational waves .",
    "because of their smallness , no such effects were ever observed .",
    "accordingly , the interaction of a classical electromagnetic field @xmath22 in the form of a lightray with a prescribed gravitational field @xmath13 is well described by means of eqs.([maxwell - l ; ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , further consequences of these equations need to be compared with experiment as soon as more sensitive measuring methods are available .",
    "according to einstein s equivalence principle , see @xcite , gravity can be _ locally simulated _ in a gravity - free region of spacetime by going over from the cartesian coordinates , anchored in an inertial frame of reference ( including an intertial clock ) and used in ( [ maxwell - l ] ) , to arbitrary curvilinear coordinates yielding a non - inertial frame in general , as in ( [ maxwell - l ; ] ) . in this context",
    ", the metric @xmath23 , occurring in ( [ fcontra ] ) and in the semicolons of ( [ maxwell - l ; ] ) , is understood as a flat metric in curvilinear coordinates .",
    "thus , the minimal coupling can be interpreted , in a first step , just as a coordinate transformation from cartesian to curvilinear coordinates . and ,",
    "moreover , it _ identifies _ the metric as the gravitational potential .    on the other hand ,",
    "let us assume that we are in a region _ with _ gravity and ( [ fcontra ] ) and ( [ maxwell - l ; ] ) are valid together with the einstein equation for the metric .",
    "then , also according to einstein s equivalence principle , we must be able to pick suitable coordinates such that locally the equations look like in special relativity in cartesian coordinates . in riemannian geometry ,",
    "the local coordinates are called riemannian normal ( hence geodesic ) coordinates at one point @xmath24 , if the christoffel symbols @xmath25 vanish at @xmath24 and and the metric becomes minkowskian : @xmath26 accordingly , the semicolon becomes a comma and the metric in ( [ fcontra ] ) , at one given point , looks flat .",
    "still , the curvature is non - vanishing , of course : @xmath27 .",
    "the equations look flat since they contain only _ first _ derivatives .",
    "if they contained second derivatives , then the semicolons goes to comma rule and its reverse would _ not _ work since on that level not only the christoffels enter but potentially also the curvature which , in contrast to the christoffels , is a tensor and can not be nullified by means of a suitable choice of coordinates .",
    "for that reason , the minimal coupling procedure , being in this context an expression of the equivalence principle , must be applied only to first order differential equations .",
    "the safest thing is then to apply it , as a rule , only on the level of a _ lagrangian _ , since there ordinarily only first - order expressions are allowed for .",
    "non - minimal couplings of the gravitational field to electromagnetism have also been investigated , see prasanna @xcite , buchdahl @xcite , goenner @xcite , and mller - hoissen @xcite , for example , or for light rays in non - minimally coupled theories , see drummond and hathrell @xcite , but the price one has to pay is to introduce a new constant of nature ; and there is no evidence for such a constant in nature  unless one takes the planck length itself .",
    "we will come back to these questions in sec.7 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the equivalence principle and minimal coupling work well for the maxwell - lorentz equations ( [ maxwell - l ] ) and that they lead to experimentally established equations .",
    "we hasten to add that , within the framework of the minimally coupled maxwell - lorentz equations , we find 2nd derivatives if we derive the wave equation for the electromagnetic field strength @xmath3  and then also curvature terms are expected to emerge .",
    "this is exactly what happens , as already found by gordon @xcite and eddington @xcite .    in the framework of exterior calculus ( see frankel @xcite ) , let us consider the electromagnetic field strength 2-form @xmath28 . in maxwell - lorentz vacuum electrodynamics , it satisfies @xmath29 .",
    "we denote the codifferential by @xmath30",
    ". then we find , with the wave operator ( dalembertian ) @xmath31 and by using the maxwell - lorentz equations , the wave equation @xmath32 see @xcite .",
    "the left hand side of this equation , in terms of components , can be determined by substituting ( [ dalembertian ] ) : @xmath33k } - r^{kl}{}_{ij}\\,f_{kl } \\right)dx^i\\wedge dx^j\\,.\\label{deltaf}\\ ] ] accordingly , minimal coupling can lead to curvature terms of a prescribed form . see sec.7 . ]",
    "soon after general relativity had been proposed , it became clear , see einstein @xcite , that one can introduce as _ auxiliary variables _ the densities @xmath34 with @xmath35 , in terms of which the maxwell - lorentz equations ( [ maxwell - l ] ) can be rewritten in a metric - free way as @xmath36 similarly , the charge conservation law @xmath37 can be put in the form @xmath38 the metric enters only via the densities defined in ( [ densities ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we started from the set ( [ maxwell - dens ] ) in special relativity right away , then no comma goes to semicolon rule would have been necessary : these equations are generally covariant , they are valid in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates , be it in the framework of special or general relativity theory .    in the calculus of _ exterior differential forms _ ( cartan calculus ) , see frankel @xcite , these equations can be formulated very succinctly .",
    "we introduce the electric current as odd 3-form , @xmath39 the electromagnetic excitation as odd 2-form @xmath40 and the electromagnetic field strength as even 2-form @xmath41 then ( [ maxwell - dens ] ) reads @xmath42 with @xmath43 the set ( [ maxwell - excalc ] ) represents the maxwell equations .",
    "they are independent of metric and connection .",
    "the constitutive relation for the vacuum reads @xmath44 where the star @xmath45 represents the metric - dependent and odd hodge duality operator .",
    "eq.([vacuum ] ) corresponds to ( [ densities])@xmath46 and @xmath47 can be related to the components of @xmath48 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 , the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor density .",
    "now the equivalence principle looks empty : since the maxwell equations ( [ maxwell - excalc ] ) are formulated in a coordinate and frame independent way , they are valid in this form in arbitrary coordinate systems and frames , be it in a flat or in a curved spacetime . only the constitutive relation ( [ vacuum ] )",
    "`` feels '' , up to a conformal factor , the presence of a flat or a non - flat metric , i.e. , the constitutive relation couples to the conformally invariant part of the metric .",
    "the coupling of electromagnetism to gravity becomes almost trivial .",
    "is all this just a mathematical trick , which distracts from the physical content of maxwell s theory , or is it more ?    one further observation hints also at the need for clarification .",
    "the _ einstein - cartan theory _ of gravity is a _",
    "viable _ gravitational theory , see @xcite .",
    "it is the simplest model of the metric - affine _ gauge _ theory of gravity , see @xcite . in the einstein - cartan theory ,",
    "spacetime is described by means of a riemann - cartan geometry with torsion and curvature .",
    "if we couple ( [ maxwell - l ; ] ) to gravity , do we have to use the semicolons as covariant derivatives with respect to the riemann - cartan connection or still with respect to the christoffels , see @xcite ? in the context of ( [ maxwell - excalc ] ) , this question can not even be posed , since the exterior derivative @xmath51 is all what is needed .",
    "are then the equations ( [ maxwell - excalc ] ) misleading as a starting point for coupling to gauge gravity ? what could be the appropriate starting point",
    "?    provided one formulates maxwell s theory and its coupling to gravity in terms of a lagrangian with the electromagnetic potential @xmath52 as variable , gauge covariance of the formalism results in ( [ maxwell - excalc ] ) cum ( [ vacuum ] ) , as was pointed out by benn , dereli , and tucker @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to have some more immediate insight into the structure of electromagnetism as induced by experiment even without having a variational formulation at our disposal .",
    "the metric is a quantity which allows to define _ lengths _ and _ angles _ in spacetime .",
    "there are , however , laws in physics which do nt require the knowledge of a metric .",
    "take the conservation law of electric charge as an example .",
    "mark a 3-dimensional simply connected submanifold @xmath53 . we know from experiment that a possible electric charge inside @xmath53 is composed of charge `` quanta '' , i.e. , there is an integer number of elementary charges in @xmath53 .",
    "recent advances in technology made it possible , see @xcite , to trap and to count single electrons and protons .",
    "thus , as soon as we have such quanta available , we can rely on _ counting procedures _",
    ", see post @xcite , the use of a meter stick or a chronometer is superfluous under such circumstances .",
    "electric charge conservations is experimentally well - established and is one of the pillars electromagnetism rests on .",
    "we formulate it , following kottler - cartan - van dantzig , see @xcite and also @xcite , most appropriately as an integral law . according to ( [ current3 ] )",
    ", we assume the existence of the odd electric current 3-form @xmath48 .",
    "we take charge conservation as axiom 1 , that is , @xmath48 integrated over a closed 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath53 has to vanish , if this hypersurface is the boundary of a connected 4-volume @xmath54 : @xmath55 here we applied the stokes theorem .    if ( [ axiom1 ] ) is assumed to be valid @xmath56 for all three - cycles @xmath57 , @xmath58 , then , according to a theorem of de rham , @xmath48 is exact , see @xcite .",
    "thus the inhomogeneous maxwell equation is a consequence , @xmath59 with the odd 2-form @xmath60 of the electromagnetic excitation , see ( [ excitation2 ] ) .",
    "the excitation is only determined up to an exact form .",
    "nevertheless , the electric excitation @xmath61 can be _ measured _ by means of maxwellian double plates as charge per unit area , the magnetic excitation @xmath62 by means of a small test coil , which compensates the @xmath62-field to be measured , as current per unit length .",
    "this is possible since in theses null experiments vanishing field strength @xmath3 implies vanishing excitation @xmath60 , see @xcite . in other words , the extensive quantities",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62  and thus the 4-dimensional excitation @xmath60  have an operationally significance of their own , since they are related to charge at rest or in motion , respectively . accordingly",
    ", the somewhat formalistic introduction of the densities in ( [ densities ] ) has now been legitimized as a transition to operationally meaningful additive quantities .",
    "note that up to now only the differential structure of the spacetime was needed , a metric has not been involved .",
    "let us choose a field of 4-frames @xmath63 and consider the motion of a point particle with respect to the reference frame thus defined . as axiom 2",
    "one can take an operational definition of the electromagnetic field strength @xmath3 via the lorentz force density @xmath64 the interior product ( contraction ) is denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "the force density @xmath66 is a notion from classical mechanics .",
    "it is an odd covector - valued 4-form .",
    "accordingly , eq.([axiom2 ] ) can be read as a definition of the even 2-form @xmath3 , see ( [ field2 ] ) .",
    "again , we do nt need a metric .",
    "and we know the recipe of how to proceed in the same manner .",
    "that @xmath67 can be interpreted as magnetic flux is obvious if we choose @xmath68 as a ` spacelike ' surface ( strictly , at this point we do nt know what spacelike means ; we will come back to this later ) . in superconductors under suitable circumstances",
    "we can count ( in an abrikosov flux line lattice ) quantized magnetic flux lines .",
    "this suggests that magnetic flux is a conserved quantity ( axiom 3 ) : @xmath69    in this way , by means of the axioms ( [ axiom1 ] ) , ( [ axiom2 ] ) , and ( [ axiom3 ] ) , we recovered the fundamental structure of maxwell s theory : @xmath70 .",
    "this is what had been called _ metric - free electrodynamics_. and @xmath71 in a form ` isomorphic ' to the @xmath72-decomposition of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , the `` generalized '' maxwell equations , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , correspond in actual fact , just to _ maxwell s equations _ ( modulo the substitution @xmath75 ) . and",
    "this is how we will name them . ]",
    "what is missing so far is the relation between the excitation @xmath60 and the field strength @xmath3 , and it is exactly there where the metric , i.e. , the gravitational potential comes in .",
    "we now understand that the inhomogeneous maxwell equation @xmath73 , as an expression of electric charge conservation , can not be influenced by gravity , i.e. , by the metric tensor @xmath4 , or , in the case of metric - affine gravity or its specific subcases , such as einstein - cartan theory , by the connection @xmath76 of spacetime .",
    "the electric charge substratum of spacetime has rules of its own .",
    "spacetime can be deformed by the presence of metric and connection , but the charge substratum and the net electric charge to be attributed to a prescribed 3-dimensional ( 3d ) volume wo nt change .",
    "thus the additivity 3d volume - wise of the charge lays at the foundation of the maxwellian framework . and",
    "it translates into the 2d additivity of the integrated excitation @xmath77  this being the reason why one uses this integral for the operational interpretation of @xmath60 .",
    "similar arguments can be advanced for the homogeneous maxwell equation @xmath74 .",
    "however , first of all it should be stressed that the axiomatics we are using strongly suggests the non - existence of magnetic charges .",
    "if there were magnetic charges , then we would have no reason to believe in electric charge conservation either ; compare for this argument axiom 1 , eq.([axiom1 ] ) , with axiom 3 , eq.([axiom3 ] ) .",
    "conventionally , the inhomogeneous equation @xmath73 is seen in analogy to the homogeneous one @xmath74 .",
    "but not so in the framework of our axiomatics which has a firm empirical basis .",
    "we put @xmath78 in analogy to @xmath74 .",
    "the whole historical development of electromagnetism , starting with rsted and ampre , points to the elimination of the phenomenologically introduced magnetic charges .",
    "most recent experiments , see @xcite , exclude magnetic charges with very good precision .",
    "thus theoretical as well as experimental evidence speak against the existence of magnetic charges .",
    "having said this , we hasten to add that , nevertheless , there is some kind of magnetic substratum in spacetime , namely the magnetic flux @xmath67 .",
    "it is a substratum of its own right .",
    "the fluxoids , the quantized magnetic flux lines in superconductors , see @xcite , do convey a clear message . besides electric charge .",
    "] , magnetic flux . ]",
    "( and _ not _ magnetic charge ) has an independent standing in electromagnetism , too .",
    "thus rightfully , it is governed by an own axiom , namely axiom 3 .",
    "axiom 3 is again a conservation theorem .",
    "in contrast to axiom 1 , which has a fermionic smell , axiom 3 is more of a bosonic nature",
    ". moreover , magnetic flux adds up 2d area - wise . for this reason , magnetic flux",
    "is represented by a 2-form and not , like the charge , by a 3-form .",
    "accordingly , there are essential differences between these two conservation laws which express the peculiarities of the electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "electric and magnetic effects enter the maxwellian framework in an asymmetric way , in spite of all that talk about a duality between electricity and magnetism .",
    "but there is also a similarity in that both axioms are formulated as integral conservation laws .",
    "the possibility to count the fluxoids assures us that axiom 3 has to be again a law free of metric and connection .",
    "incidentally , there is a nice visualization of the fundamental quantities entering electrodynamics . if one describes the quantum hall effect for low lying landau levels , then the concept of a _",
    "composite fermion _ is very helpful : it consists of one electron and an even number of fluxoids is attached to it , see jain @xcite and @xcite . is nt that a very clear indication of what the fundamental quantities are in electrodynamics ?",
    "namely , electric charge ( see axiom 1 ) and magnetic flux ( see axiom 3 ) , see also nambu @xcite in this general context .",
    "our conclusion is then that , as long as we opt for electric charge and magnetic flux conservation , the maxwell equations in gravity - free regions , i.e. , in the minkowski spacetime of special relativity , read @xmath79 ; they _ remain the same _ irrespective of the switching on of gravity , be it in einstein s theory , in metric - affine gravity ( see @xcite ) , or in any other geometrical theory of gravity .",
    "after having discussed extensively that gravity does not influence the maxwell equations , we eventually turn to the constitutive law via which gravity does influence electrodynamics .",
    "it is true , the charge substratum and the flux substratum themselves do not couple to gravity , as we have shown in the last section .",
    "however , the interrelationship between both substrata is affected by gravity . metaphorically speaking , the `` flow '' of _",
    "each _ of the substrata is ruled by a particular gravity - independent conservation theorem , but the flows of electric charge and magnetic flux are coupled via a gravity - dependent constitutive law since , in the end , magnetism has to be expressed in terms of electricity .",
    "let us choose arbitrary local spacetime coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "then we have , @xmath80    we will turn first to the electrodynamics of material media in order to develop some intuition on the concept involved , but eventually , it will be the _ vacuum _ , be it in inertial or non - inertial frames , which will occupy the center of our interest .      moving _",
    "macroscopic _ matter defines a @xmath72-splitting of spacetime specified by a well defined average 4-vector velocity field @xmath81 which describes the congruence of worldlines of the flow of the medium .",
    "such a vector field can be defined operationally from the motion of matter as follows .",
    "let a 3dimensional arithmetic space @xmath82 be equipped with the coordinates @xmath83 .",
    "we will use these coordinates ( known as _",
    "lagrange _ coordinates in continuum mechanics ) as labels which enumerate elements of a material medium .",
    "a smooth mapping @xmath84 into the spacetime defines a 3dimensional space domain ( hypersurface ) @xmath85 which represents the initial distribution of matter . in local spacetime coordinates , this mapping ( or labeling ) is given by the four functions @xmath86 .",
    "it should be preserved at any time , i.e.  along any worldline of a particular element its labels @xmath87 are constant .    given the initial configuration @xmath85 of matter , we parameterize dynamics of the medium by the `` time '' coordinate @xmath88 which is defined as the proper time measured along an element s worldline from the original hypersurface @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting local coordinates @xmath89 are usually called the normalized comoving coordinates .",
    "thus finally , the motion of matter is described by the functions @xmath90 .",
    "subsequently , we define the 4velocity vector field by @xmath91 evidently , a family of observers comoving with the matter is characterized by the same timelike congruence @xmath90 .",
    "they are making physical ( in particular , electrodynamical ) measurements in their local reference frames which drift with the material motion .",
    "one says that a medium , moving in general , has _",
    "properties when the electromagnetic fields produce non - instantaneous polarization and magnetization effects .",
    "the most general _ linear _ constitutive law is then given , in the comoving system , by means of the integral @xmath92 the coefficients of the kernel @xmath93 are called the response functions .",
    "we expect the metric to be involved in their set - up .",
    "their form is defined by the internal properties of matter and by the motion of a medium .",
    "mashhoon @xcite has proposed a physically very interesting example of such a non - local electrodynamics in which non - locality comes as a direct consequence of the _ non - inertial _ dynamics of observers . in this case , instead of ( [ localhf ] ) , one should use the field expansions @xmath94 with respect to the coframe of a non - inertial observer @xmath95 .",
    "the constitutive law is then replaced by @xmath96 and the response kernel in ( [ non - local1 ] ) is now defined by the acceleration and rotation of the observer s reference system .",
    "it is a constitutive law for the vacuum as viewed from a non - inertial frame of reference .",
    "mashhoon imposes an addititional _ assumption _ that the kernel is of _ convolution _ type , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "then the kernel can be uniquely determined by means of the volterra technique , and often it is possible to use the laplace transformation in order to simplify the computations . unfortunately , although mashhoon s kernel is always calculable in principle , in actual practice one normally can not obtain @xmath98 explicitly in terms of the observer s acceleration and rotation .    preserving the main ideas of mashhoon s approach , one can abandon the convolution condition",
    ". then the general form of the kernel can be worked out explicitly ( @xmath81 is the observer s 4-velocity ) : @xmath99}_\\lambda\\,\\delta(\\tau -\\tau ' ) - u\\rfloor\\gamma_\\lambda{}^{\\gamma]}(\\tau')\\right).\\label{newansatz}\\ ] ] the influence of non - inertiality is manifest in the presence of the connection 1-form .",
    "the kernel ( [ newansatz ] ) coincides with the original mashhoon kernel in the case of constant acceleration and rotation , but in general the two kernels are different @xcite .",
    "perhaps , only the direct observations would establish the true form of the non - local constitutive law .",
    "however , such a non - local effect has not been confirmed experimentally as yet .",

    "the maxwell equation @xmath227 reflects ( and comes from ) the electric current conservation , @xmath228 , see sec.[first ] . by modifying the left hand side of @xmath227",
    ", one can arrive at a model violating charge conservation .",
    "such a modification can typically originate from a non - minimal coupling of the electromagnetic to the gravitational field .",

    "however , curvature dependent terms can not be accommodated at the level of the maxwell equations , since the contraction of the indices produces always a form of even rank whereas the maxwell equations are represented by 3-forms , i.e. , by forms of odd rank . in any case , violating charge or flux conservation is not possible without giving up most of the experimentally established structure of the theory of electromagnetism .",
    "therefore we will not follow this path .",
    "incidentally , there are some papers in the literature in which the conventional vacuum constitutive law @xmath234 is uphold , but the maxwell equations are coupled to torsion in an inconsistent way .",
    "a closer inspection of the papers @xcite shows that the proposed  non - minimal \" coupling of torsion to the electromagnetic field is void of physical contents .",
    "in fact , torsion drops out if the algebra is done correctly .",
    "another procedure comes to mind if we talk about the violation of the conservation laws .",

    "superficially , the axial scalar @xmath154 ( abelian axion ) and the scalar tlaplon @xmath235 may look similar .",
    "however , the axion already emerges from spacetime viewed as a differential manifold as soon as a linear constitutive law is assumed for electromagnetism , whereas the tlaplon can only be introduced if the differential manifold in equipped with a linear connection . in other words ,",
    "the axion is a pre - metric and a pre - connection animal , the tlaplon , in contrast , needs to be ` housed ' in a linear connection .",
    "moreover , as we saw , the axion respects the conservation laws ( and pleases us thereby ) , whereas the tlaplon defies these rules and appears as an anti - electromagnetic creature .",
    "the electromagnetic field is not defined in the conventional way , namely by @xmath240 . instead , hojman et al .",
    "define it via a  covariant \" derivative according to @xmath241 thus the `` electromagnetic '' lagrangian becomes @xmath242 the last term does not contribute to the excitation @xmath243 , but the second term produces a contribution @xmath244    we can compare now the two contributions from the axion ( [ ax - mom ] ) and the tlaplon ( [ tor - mom ] ) .",
    "they are reminiscent of each other since one is equal to the hodge dual of the other .",
    "therefore , in the tlaplon case , besides a connection , we need additionally a metric . but the most decisive difference is , as can be read off from ( [ tlaplonlagrangian ] ) , that the maxwell equations get amended and axiom 1 and axiom 3 are no longer valid .",
    "the message is then that a change of the maxwell equations @xmath245 is to be avoided , unless one allows for a violation of electric charge or magnetic flux conservation . by introducing the metric @xmath11 into the constitutive law",
    ", one gets a smooth and natural transition from special relativity to general relativity and to gauge theories of gravity . in the constitutive law for vacuum one could imagine , along with the contributions depending only on the metric , couplings like @xcite @xmath246j } - { ric}^{j[k}g^{l]i } )   + a_5\\,r\\,g^{i[k}g^{l]j } + a_6\\,r\\,\\epsilon^{ijkl}\\label{rfcoupling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without violating the conservation laws . here",

    ", this coupling would be non - minimal , @xmath254 but such an ansatz would not spoil the fundamental principles of electrodynamics ; it would seem to be the most natural way of achieving an @xmath255-coupling .",
    "goenner @xcite , see also the literature given there , derived this non - minimal lagrangian from some fundamental principles , like the existence of a decent newtonian limit .",
    "however , in his view , such a model violates charge conservation .",
    "we disagree with him on this point .",
    "we want to stress that one can not achieve a similar non - minimal coupling to the torsion @xmath229 of spacetime .",
    "first of all , the maxwell equations are independent of torsion . by means of the constitutive law one",
    "maps the 2-form @xmath3 to the 2-form @xmath60 .",
    "the curvature @xmath256 is a 2-form of type @xmath257 , i.e. , it carries two @xmath258 indices , whereas the torsion 2-form carries only one index .",

    "a coupling like @xmath259 is not possible , since this is a 3-form .",

    ", it is not too difficult to introduce a coupling of torsion to electromagnetism .",
    "however , the price one has to pay is the introduction of new natural constants @xmath263 and @xmath264 . in other words ,",
    "even if possible , we do nt take such models too seriously .",
    "also non - minimally coupled nonmetricity could be installed by additional quadratic pieces such as @xmath265{}^\\star \\!f \\,.\\ ] ] therefore , there are quite a number of different `` admissible '' options available as soon as we allow non - minimal couplings to arise .",

    "<S> the coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity is an age - old problem . presently , there is a resurgence of interest in it , mainly for two reasons : ( i ) experimental investigations are under way with ever increasing precision , be it in the laboratory or by observing outer space . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) one desires to test out alternatives to einstein s gravitational theory , in particular those of a gauge - theoretical nature , like einstein - cartan theory or metric - affine gravity. a clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> if one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux , one finds maxwell s equations expressed in terms of the excitation @xmath0 and the field strength @xmath1 without any intervention of the metric or the linear connection of spacetime . in other words , there is still no coupling to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> only the constitutive law @xmath2 mediates such a coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the different ways of how metric , nonmetricity , torsion , and curvature can come into play here . along the way </S>",
    "<S> , we touch on non - local laws ( mashhoon ) , non - linear ones ( born - infeld , heisenberg - euler , plebaski ) , linear ones , including the abelian axion ( ni ) , and find a method for _ deriving _ the metric from linear electrodynamics ( toupin , schnberg ) . finally , we discuss possible non - minimal coupling schemes . </S>"
