    "randall - sundrum ( rs ) models  @xcite , in which all standard model ( sm ) fields are allowed to propagate in the bulk  @xcite , represent a very exciting alternative to more traditional extensions of the sm , like supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to a geometrical solution of the gauge hierarchy problem , among the achievements of this new physics ( np ) scenario , we mention the natural generation of hierarchies in fermion masses and weak mixing angles  @xcite and the suppression of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions  @xcite .    in this class of models , once the value of the warping factor @xmath3 is set in order to address the gauge hierarchy problem , the kaluza klein ( kk ) scale @xmath2 is the only free parameter coming from geometry . in the simplest rs model with only the sm gauge group in the bulk",
    ", @xmath2 has a quite strict bound ( @xmath4 tev ) , coming from the requirement of fitting the electroweak ( ew ) parameters .",
    "however a necessary , though not always sufficient , condition for direct signals of rs models at the lhc is the existence of kk modes with @xmath5 masses . to reduce the np effects in the ew parameters as well as the np contributions to the coupling @xmath6 , the gauge group in the bulk is enlarged to @xmath7 ( rs model with custodial protection ) and",
    "the fermions are put in symmetric representations of @xmath8  @xcite , in such a way that the coupling @xmath6 is sm - like . ] .",
    "this allows for a scale @xmath9tev  @xcite . in this framework",
    "( see also  @xcite for a detailed description ) the flavor structure is quite rich , since the parameter space includes @xmath10 real parameters and @xmath11 phases in addition to the @xmath12 free parameters present in the sm  @xcite .",
    "the model goes beyond minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) .",
    "basically there are two main origins of non - mfv effects :    * the explanation of the hierarchies of sm fermion masses and mixings leads to non - universalities in the kk gauge boson - sm fermion interaction , implying fcncs at tree level mediated by the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "the same holds also for sm gauge bosons which , after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , mix with the kk gauge bosons .",
    "hence , also effects of non - unitarity of the ckm matrix appear  @xcite . *",
    "the mixing , through ewsb , of the new heavy fermions and the sm ones  @xcite .",
    "fcncs at tree level usually constitute a serious problem of models beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "however in the rs model with custodial protection the suppression of fcnc transitions to an acceptable level , even in presence of relatively light kk gauge bosons , can be guaranteed by two mechanisms : the _ custodial protection _ of all the flavor off - diagonal @xmath13 couplings  @xcite and the _ rs - gim mechanism _  @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that these two protection mechanisms can not eliminate severe constraints coming from the cp violating ( cpv ) observable @xmath14 .",

    "middle : the same for @xmath16 .",
    "right : correlation between @xmath17 and the semileptonic asymmetry @xmath18 normalized to its sm value.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "due to the presence of right - handed currents , @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson mixings receive a contribution not only from the operator already present in the sm , but also from new operators , like the scalar left - right @xmath19 , generated by the exchange of kk - gluons at tree level . in the case of the @xmath0 system , this operator is strongly chirally and qcd enhanced . assuming anarchic 5d yukawas and light @xmath2 , these effects are too large to be controlled by the rs - gim mechanism , resulting in a general too large np contribution in @xmath14 , as also shown in  @xcite where a lower bound on @xmath2 of @xmath20 tev was found . to further investigate the issue",
    ", we perform a fine tuning analysis  @xcite of @xmath14 ( left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : finetuning ] ) , finding that , because of the rich parameter space , there are points which are able to fit the experimental @xmath14 . among them",
    "@xmath21 require a fine tuning smaller than 20 .",
    "on the other hand , we do not expect a too large np contribution for the cp conserving ( cpc ) observable @xmath16 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : finetuning ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the sm , differently from @xmath15 , @xmath16 depends on the real part of the mixing amplitude @xmath22 and not on its very small imaginary part .",
    "the observable @xmath14 turned out to be the only restrictive constraint , coming from meson mixings .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath1 systems the qcd and chiral enhancements of the operator @xmath23 are much smaller than in the @xmath0 system , @xmath24 and of the kk gluons are comparable  @xcite .",
    "] , resulting in a not too large np contribution to the cpc and cpv observables . proceeding with the subset of phenomenologically valid points of the parameter space , we analyse the possible np effects in observables , where a large room for np is still open . in the right panel of fig .",

    "in contrast with the sm , where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems are governed by a flavor - universal loop function @xmath31 , the np contributions are proportional to the ckm factors @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , implying generally larger np effects in @xmath0 decays than in @xmath1 decays , because of the hierarchy @xmath34 .    in order to reduce the parameter dependence , in fig .  [",
    "fig : rare ] we investigate some possible correlations between different observables ( for a complete analysis see  @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath35 vs @xmath25 ( left panel ) : due to the general much larger np contributions in the rare @xmath0 decay ( up to a factor 3 ) , compared to the np effects in the rare @xmath36 decay ( up to @xmath37 ) , the correlation of models with mfv is strongly broken .",
    "this plot gives a testable way to distinguish this scenario from mfv models .",
    "* @xmath26 vs @xmath17 ( right panel ) : both observables can be significantly enhanced , but not simultaneously .",
    "this particular anticorrelation can be tested by future experiments ( lhcb , j - parc , ... ) .",
    "a careful analysis of the operator structure of the flavor sector of the rs model with custodial protection and a detailed fine - tuning investigation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson mixings observables show that the only stringent bound on the kk scale @xmath2 , coming from @xmath38 observables , is represented by @xmath15 .",
    "fixing @xmath2 in the reach of lhc , once that these observables , together with sm fermion masses and mixings , are fitted , the pattern of np deviations is clear :    * the cp violating observable @xmath17 can have large contributions of np , as well as the branching ratios of the rare decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "* the same does not hold for the rare decays of @xmath36 mesons , where the np contributions are quite small , probably below the sensitivity of lhcb .",
    "* a future measurement of large np contributions in @xmath17 would close the np room for @xmath0 rare decays .",
