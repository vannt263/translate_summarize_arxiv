    "noiseless index coding problem was first introduced by birk and kol @xcite as an informed source coding problem over a broadcast channel .",
    "it involves a single source @xmath4 that wishes to send @xmath5 messages from a set @xmath6 , to a set of @xmath7 receivers @xmath8 .",
    "a receiver @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 is identified by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the set of messages demanded by the receiver @xmath9 and @xmath14 is the set of messages known to the receiver @xmath9 a priori , called the side information set .",
    "the index coding problem can be specified by @xmath15 .",
    "an index code for the index coding problem @xmath15 consists of + @xmath16 an encoding function @xmath17 + @xmath18 a set of decoding functions @xmath19 such that , for a given input @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the optimal index code as defined in @xcite is that index code which minimizes @xmath22 , the length of the index code which is equal to the number of binary transmissions required to satisfy the demands of all the receivers .",
    "an index code is said to be linear if its encoding function is linear and linearly decodable if all its decoding functions are linear @xcite .",
    "the class of index coding problems where each receiver demands a single unique message were named in @xcite as single unicast index coding problems . for such index coding problems , @xmath23 .",
    "wlog , for a single unicast index coding problem , let the receiver @xmath24 demand the message @xmath25 .",
    "the side information graph @xmath26 , of a single unicast index coding problem , is a directed graph on @xmath5 vertices where an edge @xmath27 exists if and only if @xmath24 knows the message @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the minrank over @xmath29 of the side information graph @xmath26 is defined in @xcite as @xmath30 , where a 0 - 1 matrix @xmath31 is said to fit @xmath26 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , if @xmath34 is not an edge in @xmath26 and @xmath35 denotes the rank over @xmath36 .",
    "bar - yossef et al . in @xcite",
    "established that single unicast index coding problems can be expressed using a side information graph and the length of an optimal index code for such an index coding problem is equal to the minrank over @xmath29 of the corresponding side information graph .",
    "this was extended in @xcite to a general instance of index coding problem using minrank over @xmath37 of the corresponding side information hypergraph .    in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "noiseless binary channels were considered and hence the problem of index coding was formulated as a scheme to reduce the number of binary transmissions .",
    "this amounts to minimum bandwidth consumption , with binary transmission .",
    "we consider noisy index coding problems over awgn broadcast channel . here , we can reduce bandwidth further by using some m - ary modulation scheme . a previous work which considered index codes over gaussian broadcast channel",
    "is by natarajan et al.@xcite .",
    "index codes based on multi - dimensional qam constellations were proposed and a metric called  side information gain \" was introduced as a measure of efficiency with which the index codes utilize receiver side information .",
    "however @xcite does not consider the index coding problem as originally defined in @xcite and @xcite as it does not minimize the number of transmissions .",
    "it always uses @xmath38- point signal sets , whereas we use signal sets of smaller sizes as well as @xmath38- point signal set for the same index coding problem .",
    "we consider index coding problems over @xmath36 , over awgn broadcast channels . for a given index coding problem , for an index code of length @xmath0",
    ", we propose to use @xmath1- ary modulation scheme to broadcast the index codeword rather than using @xmath0 bpsk transmissions , with the energy of the symbol being equal to that of @xmath0 binary transmissions .",
    "our contributions are summarized below .    *",
    "an algorithm , to map @xmath0 index coded bits to a @xmath1- psk/ @xmath1-qam signal set is given .",
    "* we show that by transmitting @xmath0 index coded bits as a signal point from @xmath1- psk or qam constellation , certain receivers get both coding gain as well as bandwidth gain and certain other receivers trade off coding gain for bandwidth gain . * a necessary and sufficient condition that the side information possessed by a receiver should satisfy so as to get coding gain over a receiver with no side information is presented . *",
    "we show that it is not always necessary to find the minimum number of binary transmissions required for a given index coding problem , i.e. , a longer index code may give higher coding gains to certain receivers . *",
    "we find that for index coding problems satisfying a sufficient condition , the difference in probability of error performance between the best performing receiver and the worst performing receiver widens monotonically with the length of the index code employed . *",
    "we prove that transmitting the @xmath0 index coded bits as a qam signal is better than transmitting them as a psk signal if the receivers see an effective signal set with eight points or more .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , the index coding problem setting that we consider is formally defined with examples . the bandwidth gain and coding gain obtained by receivers by transmitting index coded bits as a psk symbol are formally defined . a necessary and sufficient condition that the side information possessed by a receiver should satisfy so as to get coding gain over a receiver with no side information",
    "is stated and proved . in section [ sec : psk_algo ] , we give an algorithm to map the index coded bits to a @xmath1- psk symbol such that the receiver with maximum amount of side information sees maximum psk - sicg . in section [ sec : icqam ] , we compare the transmission of index coded bits as a psk signal against transmitting them as a qam signal .",
    "the algorithm given in section [ sec : psk_algo ] itself can be used to map index codewords to qam signal set .",
    "we find that all the results including the necessary and sufficient condition to get coding gain holds and show that transmitting the index coded bits as a qam signal gives better performance if the receivers see an effective signal set with eight points or more .",
    "we go on to give examples with simulation results to support our claims in the subsequent section [ sec : simu ] . finally concluding remarks and directions for future work is given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "consider an index coding problem @xmath39 , over @xmath36 , with @xmath5 messages and @xmath7 receivers , where each receiver demands a single message .",
    "this is sufficient since any general index coding problem can be converted into one where each receiver demands exactly one message , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "a receiver which demands more than one message , i.e. , @xmath41 , can be considered as @xmath42 equivalent receivers all having the same side information set @xmath43 and demanding a single message each .",
    "since the same message can be demanded by multiple receivers , this gives @xmath44 .",
    "for the given index coding problem , let the length of the index code used be @xmath0 .",
    "then , instead of transmitting @xmath0 bpsk symbols , which we call the @xmath0- fold bpsk scheme , we will transmit a single point from a @xmath45- psk signal set with the energy of the @xmath45- psk symbol being equal to @xmath0 times the energy of a bpsk symbol , i.e. , equal to the total transmitted energy of the @xmath0 bpsk symbols .",
    "[ ex_psk_1 ] let @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let the side information sets be @xmath48 .",
    "+ the minrank over @xmath29 of the side information graph corresponding to the above problem evaluates to @xmath49 .",
    "an optimal linear index code is given by the encoding matrix ,    @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the index coded bits are @xmath51 , where,@xmath52=\\left[x_1\\ x_2\\ \\ldots x_7\\right]l=\\textbf{x}l\\ ] ]    @xmath53    in the 4-fold bpsk index coding scheme we will transmit 4 bpsk symbols . in the scheme that we propose , we will map the index coded bits to the signal points of a 16-psk constellation and transmit a single complex number thereby saving bandwidth . to keep energy per bit the same , the energy of the 16-psk symbol transmitted will be equal to the total energy of the 4 transmissions in the 4-fold bpsk scheme .",
    "this scheme of transmitting index coded bits as a single psk signal will give bandwidth gain in addition to the gain in bandwidth obtained by going from @xmath5 to @xmath0 bpsk transmissions .",
    "this extra gain is termed as psk bandwidth gain .",
    "the term _ psk bandwidth gain _ is defined as the factor by which the bandwidth required to transmit the index code is reduced , obtained while transmitting a @xmath45- psk signal point instead of transmitting @xmath0 bpsk signal points .    for an index coding problem",
    ", there will be a reduction in required bandwidth by a factor of @xmath2 , which will be obtained by all receivers .    with proper mapping of the index coded bits to psk symbols ,",
    "the algorithm for which is given in section [ sec : psk_algo ] , we will see that receivers with more amount of side information will get better performance in terms of probability of error , provided the side information available satisfies certain properties .",
    "this gain in error performance , which is solely due to the effective utilization of available side information by the proposed mapping scheme , is termed as psk side information coding gain ( psk - sicg ) .",
    "further , by sending the index coded bits as a @xmath1- psk signal point , if a receiver gains in probability of error performance relative to a receiver in the @xmath0- fold bpsk transmission scheme , we say that the receiver gets psk absolute coding gain ( psk - acg ) .",
    "the term _ psk side information coding gain _ is defined as the coding gain a receiver with side information gets relative to one with no side information , when the index code of length @xmath0 is transmitted as a signal point from a @xmath45- psk constellation .    the term _ psk absolute coding gain _",
    "is defined as the gain in probability of error performance obtained by any receiver in the @xmath1- psk signal transmission scheme relative to its performance in n- fold bpsk transmission scheme .",
    "we present a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a receiver to get psk - sicg in the following subsection .",
    "let @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 encoding matrix corresponding to the linear index code chosen . since @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 .",
    "for each of the receivers @xmath59 , define the set @xmath60 to be the set of all binary transmissions which @xmath9 knows a priori , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "for example , in example [ ex_psk_1 ] , @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65    let @xmath66 . for example , in example [ ex_psk_1 ] , @xmath67 .",
    "[ th_psk_1 ] a receiver @xmath9 will get psk - sicg if and only if its available side information satisfies at least one of the following two conditions : @xmath68    equivalently , a receiver @xmath24 will get psk - sicg if and only if @xmath69    the equivalence of the conditions in ( [ eq : th1_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : th1_2 ] ) and the condition in ( [ eq : th1_3 ] ) is straight - forward since @xmath70 will be less than @xmath0 if and only if at least one of the two conditions given in ( [ eq : th1_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : th1_2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 , @xmath75 .    _ proof of the `` if part '' _ : if condition ( [ eq : th1_1 ] ) is satisfied , the ml decoder at @xmath24 need not search through all codewords in @xmath76 . for a given realization of @xmath77 , say , @xmath78 , the decoder needs to search through only the codewords in @xmath79 i.e. , the codewords in @xmath76 which resulted from @xmath80 such that @xmath81 . since number of such @xmath80 is @xmath82 , the decoder need not search through all the codewords in @xmath76 .    similarly if the condition ( [ eq : th1_2 ] ) is satisfied , then also the ml decoder at @xmath24 need not search through all the codewords in @xmath76 . for any fixed realization of @xmath77 , the values of @xmath83 are also fixed .",
    "the decoder needs to search through only those @xmath84 with the given fixed values of @xmath83 .",
    "again , the number of such @xmath85 is less than @xmath1 .",
    "thus , if any of the two conditions of the theorem is satisfied , the ml decoder at @xmath24 need to search through a reduced number of signal points , which we call the effective signal set seen by @xmath24 .",
    "the size of the effective signal set seen by the receiver is @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , by appropriate mapping of the index coded bits to psk symbols , we can increase @xmath87 the minimum distance of the effective signal set seen by the receiver @xmath24 , @xmath88 , thus getting psk - sicg .",
    "_ proof of the `` only if part '' _ : if none of the two conditions of the theorem are satisfied or equivalently if @xmath89 , then the effective signal set seen by @xmath24 will be the entire @xmath1-psk signal set .",
    "thus @xmath90 can not be increased .",
    "@xmath90 will remain equal to the minimum distance of the corresponding @xmath45 psk signal set .",
    "therefore the receiver @xmath24 will not get psk - sicg .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : th1_2 ] ) above indicates how the psk side information coding gain is influenced by the linear index code chosen .",
    "different index codes for the same index coding problem will give different values of @xmath91 $ ] and hence leading to possibly different psk side information coding gains .           ' '' ''    consider the receiver @xmath92 in example [ ex_psk_1 ] .",
    "it satisfies both the conditions with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for a particular message realization @xmath95",
    ", the only index coded bit @xmath92 does not know a priori is @xmath96 .",
    "hence there are only 2 possibilities for the received codeword at the receiver @xmath92 .",
    "hence it needs to decode to one of these 2 codewords , not to one of the 16 codewords that are possible had it not known any of @xmath97 a priori .",
    "then we say that @xmath92 sees an effective codebook of size 2 .",
    "this reduction in the size of the effective codebook seen by the receiver @xmath92 is due to the presence of side information that satisfied condition ( [ eq : th1_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : th1_2 ] ) above .    for a receiver to see an effective codebook of size @xmath98",
    ", it is not necessary that the available side information should satisfy both the conditions .",
    "if at least one of the two conditions is satisfied , then that receiver will see an effective codebook of reduced size and hence will get psk - sicg by proper mapping of index coded bits to @xmath1- psk symbols .",
    "this can be seen from the following example .",
    "[ ex3 ] let @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "let the known sets be @xmath101 .",
    "+ the minrank over @xmath29 of the side information graph corresponding to the above problem evaluates to @xmath49 .",
    "an optimal linear index code is given by the encoding matrix ,    @xmath102 $ ] +    the index coded bits in this example are , @xmath103    here , receiver @xmath104 does not satisfy condition ( 1 ) since @xmath105 .",
    "however , it will still see an effective codebook of size 8 , since @xmath106 , and hence will get psk - sicg by proper mapping of the codewords to 16-psk signal points .",
    "the condition required for a receiver @xmath24 to get psk - acg is that the minimum distance of the effective signal set seen by it , @xmath107 since the minimum distance seen by any receiver while using @xmath0-fold bpsk to transmit the index coded bits is @xmath108 .    for the class of index coding problems with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which were called single unicast single uniprior in @xcite , @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , no receiver will get psk - sicg .",
    "in this subsection we discuss the effect of the length of the index code used on the probability of error performance of different receivers .",
    "we consider index codes of all lengths from the minimum length @xmath112 minrank over @xmath36 of the corresponding side information hypergraph to the maximum possible value of @xmath113 .",
    "consider the following example .",

    "optimal mappings for the three different cases considered are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_n_to_n1](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively .           ' '' ''    the values of @xmath126 for the different receivers while using the three different index codes are summarized in table [ table_eta ] .",
    "we see that the receiver @xmath92 sees a two point signal set irrespective of the length of the index code used .",
    "since as the length of the index code increases , the energy of the signal also increases , @xmath92 will see a larger minimum distance when a longer index coded is used .",
    "however , the minimum distance seen by the receiver @xmath127 is that of the @xmath1 signal set in all the three cases , which decreases as @xmath0 increases .",
    "hence the difference between the performances of @xmath92 and @xmath127 increases as the length of the index code increases .",
    "this is generalized in the following lemma .",
    ".table showing values of @xmath126 for different receivers .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that while @xmath128 performs better while the index coded bits are transmitted as a psk signal , the other receivers have better performance when a qam symbol is transmitted .",
    "this is because of the difference in the minimum distances seen by the different receivers as summarized in table [ table - ex_psk_qam ] .",
    "this observation agrees with theorem [ th_qam ] .",
    "the mapping and 2-d transmission scheme proposed in this paper is applicable to any index coding problem setting . in a practical scenario , we can use this mapping scheme to prioritize those customers who are willing to pay more , provided their side information satisfies the condition mentioned in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "further , the mapping scheme depends on the index code , i.e. , the encoding matrix , @xmath55 , chosen , since @xmath55 determines @xmath129 .",
    "so we can even choose an @xmath55 matrix such that it favors our chosen customer , provided @xmath55 satisfies the condition that all users use the minimum possible number of binary transmissions to decode their required messages .",
    "further , if we are interested only in giving the best possible performance to a chosen customer who has large amount of side information and not in giving the best possible performance to every receiver , then using a @xmath38- psk / qam would be a better strategy .",
    "the mapping and 2-d transmission scheme introduced in this paper are also applicable to index coding over fading channels which was considered in @xcite .",
