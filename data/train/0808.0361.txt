    "the first - order excitation of a nucleus , induced by the coulomb field from another nucleus , has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the semi - classical perturbation theory developed there was based on a classical , non - relativistic coulomb orbit for the relative motion of the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "a relativistic description was later developed but it was restricted to straight - line trajectories @xcite .",
    "this leaves a gap in the theoretical description at intermediate energies ( say , at 20 - 200 mev / nucleon ) , where both relativistic effects and coulomb distortions of the trajectory can be important .",
    "this is very unfortunate because many experiments have been performed in recent years at intermediate - energy , radioactive beam facilities .",
    "these include coulomb dissociation experiments , for example , of @xmath1b , @xmath2be and @xmath2li , and coulomb excitation measurements in inverse kinematics , mostly of the lowest @xmath3 state in light and medium heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to devise a model that interpolates smoothly between the non - relativistic description of the coulomb excitation which is based on coulomb trajectories @xcite and the relativistic description which is based on straight - line trajectories @xcite . to develop an exact theory that contains the two extreme descriptions as limits is in general a difficult task .",
    "it has been studied by bertulani et al .",
    "@xcite , who considered the effects of retardation explicitly for a coulomb trajectory .",
    "the method proposed here is much simpler but it is sufficiently accurate for analyzing the data that have been obtained at intermediate energies .",
    "the point is that the experimental uncertainties are often large , typically of the order of 10% , and there are also theoretical uncertainties , which can distort the analysis of data , for example , the influence of nuclear and higher - order processes",
    ".    the accuracy of the proposed model of the intermediate - energy coulomb excitation is tested by analyzing the results obtained with the commonly used ` coulomb corrected ' straight - line trajectory method , which originally was proposed by winther and alder @xcite .",
    "another test is to use b(e2 ) values that are known from other measurements ( for example , of the life - time ) and compare the calculated cross sections to measurements that have been performed at intermediate energies .",
    "there has recently been a debate in the literature @xcite about the validity of the analyses of coulomb excitation experiments that have been performed in the past .",
    "it turned out to be caused by a misunderstanding of the experimental conditions , as pointed out in ref .",
    "however , independent of the controversy , it was claimed that corrections to the low - energy and high - energy theories of coulomb excitation could be as large as 20% or 30% at intermediate energies @xcite . in this paper",
    "it will be shown how this large uncertainty can be brought under control and reduced to only a few percent .",
    "the semi - classical theory of the non - relativistic coulomb excitation is summarized in sections ii to iii .",
    "the expressions that are obtained from straight - line and coulomb trajectories , respectively , are compared in section iv . the analytic expression for the relativistic coulomb excitation in the straight line trajectory approximation",
    "is quoted in section v , and it is used to devise a model which includes the combined effect of relativity and coulomb trajectories .",
    "the model is tested in section vi against measurements and other calculations , and section vii contains the conclusions .",
    "the semi - classical , non - relativistic description of coulomb excitation @xcite is summarized in the following .",
    "thus we consider a target nucleus with atomic number @xmath4 which is being excited by the coulomb field from a projectile nucleus with atomic number @xmath5 .",
    "it is assumed that the projectile and target do not overlap during the collision .",
    "we can therefore use the so - called far - field approximation which assumes that the intrinsic coordinate @xmath6 of the target nucleus is smaller that the distance @xmath7 between projectile and target .",
    "the first - order amplitude for the electric excitation of the target nucleus , from an initial state @xmath8 to a final state @xmath9 , is given by the multipole expansion @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the excitation energy , @xmath12 is the multipole operator @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the so - called orbital integral .",
    "it depends on the orbit @xmath15 of the projectile with respect to the target nucleus .",
    "the unit vector @xmath16 is expressed in terms of the spherical coordinates @xmath17 in the last expression .",
    "it is noted that this definition of the orbital integral , eq .",
    "( [ orbint ] ) , differs by the factor @xmath18 from the convention used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the orbital integrals is discussed in the following sections for two choices of the coordinate system .",
    "the first choice , system a , is the most convenient for numerical calculations that are based on a coulomb orbit @xcite .",
    "the second choice , referred to as system h , is more convenient at high energies , where a straight line trajectory becomes an accurate approximation and relativistic effects can be treated exactly @xcite .",
    "the transformation between the two representations will be discussed in order to be able to compare the two extreme methods and devise a model that interpolates smoothly between them .",
    "the coulomb excitation cross section is calculated as the product of the first - order excitation probability @xmath19 and the elastic rutherford cross section @xmath20 , @xmath21 the rutherford cross section can be obtained from the rutherford scattering formula , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the impact parameter and @xmath24 is half the of distance of closest approach in a head - on collision , and @xmath25 is the reduced mass , @xmath26 .",

    "this is done in appendix b. one of the reasons large relativistic effects have been observed is actually due to the difference between relativistic and non - relativistic kinematics , the main one being the determination of the velocity from the beam energy , eq .",

    "the non - trivial relativistic effects on the coulomb quadrupole excitation , on the other hand , are surprisingly small .",
    "let us finally take a look at how the straight - line trajectory approximation can be corrected for coulomb distortions .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "7 , namely , the coulomb excitation to the @xmath3 state of @xmath143n with excitation energy @xmath144 = 0.12 mev ( a ) , and also to the @xmath3 state of @xmath145ni with excitation energy @xmath144 = 1.4 mev ( b ) .",
    "the b(e2 ) values were taken from table 2 of ref .",
    "the results are shown in terms of the ratio to the interpolating , relativistic coulomb excitation cross section , eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) .",
    "the calculations were again performed with the minimum distance of closest approach @xmath146 . the comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 by the solid points .",
    "the cross sections from table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite were again multiplied with the factor 1.44 .",
    "it is seen that the solid points are very close to 1 for the excitation of @xmath145ni .",
    "there are some discrepancies for @xmath143n , where the average ratio is 1.028 @xmath138 0.012 .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the two theories of relativistic coulomb excitation agree within a few percent .",
    "the thick solid curves in fig .",
    "7 show the ratio for the relativistic straight - line trajectory approximation , and the dashed curves show the results of various ways to correct this approximation for coulomb distortions .",
    "the top dashed curves show the straight - line approximation multiplied by the factor @xmath97 .",
    "this factor has a large effect for the heavier nucleus @xmath145ni with the relatively large excitation energy but it has essentially no effect for the lighter nucleus @xmath143n with the small excitation energy .    the lowest dashed curves in fig .",
    "7 show the straight - line trajectory result one obtains by replacing the minimum impact parameter @xmath147 by the effective value @xmath148 = @xmath149 .",
    "this approximation was justified in ref .",
    "@xcite for large impact parameters , where the excitation probability falls off exponentially as @xmath150 . thus by multiplying the excitation probability for a straight line trajectory , @xmath151 , with the factor @xmath97 one obtains approximately , @xmath152.\\ ] ] this argument does not always apply to the coulomb excitation of low - lying states at intermediate energies because the minimum impact parameter is usually much smaller than the adiabatic distance @xmath103 . using",
    "the effective minimum impact parameter has a very large effect on the calculated cross section .",
    "it produces a ratio in fig . 7",
    "that is almost as far below 1 as the ratio for the pure straight line trajectory calculation is above 1 .",
    "the approximation is therefore not very useful for quadrupole excitations .",
    "it works apparently better for dipole excitations , as discussed in connection with figs . 2 and 3 , but",
    "that will not be discussed here .    the second lowest curves in fig .",
    "7a and 7b are the results one obtains by choosing the effective minimum impact parameter , @xmath153 , which is the minimum distance of closest approach that is used in the relativistic coulomb trajectory calculation .",
    "this approximation was recommended by goldberg @xcite , and it is evidently the best choice out of the four examples of approximations shown in fig . 7 . in the analysis of an actual experiment the cross section ratio discussed above would usually be closer to one because one would always choose a small acceptance angle ( i.  e. , a large minimum impact parameter ) in order to avoid the influence of nuclear and higher - order processes .",
    "a model has been devised for including relativistic effects in calculations of the coulomb excitation cross section at intermediate energies .",
    "the model interpolates smoothly between the theory of non - relativistic coulomb excitation at low energy and the relativistic , straight - line trajectory approximation high energy .",
    "the results that were obtained with this model compare very well with the calculations performed by bertulani et al .",
    ", who included the relativistic retardation effects explicitly for coulomb trajectories .",
    "it was demonstrated that the large relativistic effects , which have been pointed out in the literature , are mainly caused by comparing calculations that are based on a relativistic and a non - relativistic velocity , respectively .",
    "the non - trivial relativistic effects , which are beyond the simple relativistic kinematics of two - body scattering , are surprisingly small for quadrupole excitations .    the coulomb distortion , which is responsible for",
    "the deviation between the straight line trajectory approximation and calculations that are based on a coulomb trajectory , can also have a very large effect .",
    "however , the effects of the coulomb distortion are usually suppressed by the experimental conditions and simple corrections can be made to improve the accuracy of the straight line trajectory approximation .",
    "the proposed interpolating model reproduces fairly well the analyses that have been performed previously , primarily of quadrupole excitation experiments , at beam energies in the range of 30 to 70 mev / nucleon .",
    "the average deviation is only a few percent .",
    "the model also reproduces the measured cross sections in the few cases where the quadrupole excitation strength is known accurately from other sources .",
    "the good agreement with the previous analyses is partly due to the experimental conditions , which suppress the effects of the coulomb distortion , and partly to the fact that some corrections for the distortion were made in the analyses .",
    "however , if high precision coulomb excitation experiments were pursued , it would be necessary to treat the coulomb distortion more accurately in the analysis .",
    "it is believed that the interpolating coulomb excitation model proposed here would provide a sufficiently accurate description .    *",

    "moreover , the energy and momentum of the projectile in the center of mass system are ( jackson , eqs .",

    "note that the non - relativistic reduced mass @xmath180 has been replaced in the last expression by the relativistic reduced mass , @xmath181    rutherford s scattering formula in the center - of - mass system is derived from the transverse momentum transfer in elastic coulomb scattering , estimated in the straight line approximation by @xmath182 this is a reasonable approximation in high - energy forward - angle scattering but to match the non - relativistic expression , @xmath22 , one should consider the coulomb distortion of the trajectory .",
    "this would give a factor of @xmath183 on the right - hand side , so we obtain @xmath184 thus we recover the usual scattering formula , @xmath22 , but the definition of @xmath48 , eq .",
