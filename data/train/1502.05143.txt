    "natural disasters like land slide , mine collapse , earthquake cause great losses in human lives and property .",
    "it is therefore primarily important to understand the underlying mechanisms of the failure processes so that the losses can be minimized by providing a precursor .",
    "similarly for engineers the strength of material is a major quantity in order to make huge constructions like bridges , buildings etc . due to these standing requirements , during the last two decades , huge amounts of scientific efforts have been invested to explore the microscopic mechanism and rupture process of disordered materials .",
    "it has been revealed that the disorder plays a crucial role in determining the strength of material and also in the fracturing process @xcite .",
    "models of materials in the form of a bundle consisting of a large number of parallel massless elastic fibers are well known to be simple examples of critical systems exhibiting non - trivial breakdown properties @xcite . these systems are called the fiber bundle models ( fbm ) where individual fibers have randomly distributed breaking thresholds . typically , on increasing the externally applied load @xmath21 per fiber , the entire fiber bundle fails at a critical load @xmath22 per fiber .",
    "it is also known that for @xmath23 , larger the external load , more extensive is the response of the system in terms of the number of fiber failures .",
    "this number diverges as @xmath24 from below and for @xmath21 beyond @xmath22 all fibers eventually fail with certainty .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is looked upon as the transition point from a local to the global failure of the bundle @xcite .    in the fiber bundle model",
    "a set of @xmath5 parallel fibers is clamped at one end and an external load is applied at the other end @xcite .",
    "every fiber @xmath25 has its own breaking threshold @xmath26 . if the tensile stress acting through it exceeds @xmath26 it breaks .",
    "random numbers @xmath27 are drawn from a probability distribution @xmath28 and they are assigned as the breaking thresholds of the individual fibers whose cumulative distribution is @xmath29 .    in many",
    "fbms , stress is treated as a conserved quantity . during the failure of an individual fiber",
    "the stress is released and it gets distributed among the remaining intact fibers . depending on how the released stress is distributed among the intact fibers there exists various models in the literature . among these fbms the equal load sharing ( els ) model is the most well known @xcite . here",
    "the released stress is distributed equally among all the remaining intact fibers .",
    "most of the results of this model have been calculated analytically and also this model is computationally easier to tackle . on the other hand in the local load sharing ( lls ) model ,",
    "the released stress is distributed equally only to the nearest surviving neighbors @xcite . in the lls model ,",
    "most of the results have been obtained numerically .",
    "a fiber is strained when some amount of stress acts through it . for els ,",
    "the clamps at two ends of the bundle may be treated as infinitely stiff and therefore under a certain applied load , all fibers are strained by equal amounts and consequently the magnitudes of the stresses acting through the intact fibers are also equal . on the other hand ,",
    "if the clamps are elastic , different fibers are strained differently and their stress values are also different as is the situation in the lls model .",
    "a third model , intermediate between els and lls , has also been considered in the following way . in this model",
    "the released stress is distributed non - uniformly and the share amount received by an intact fiber depends inversely to some power of the distance of separation from the broken fiber @xcite .",
    "a number of other processes have been studied in the framework of fiber bundle models .",
    "for example , how the damage evolves due to an environmentally assisted aging process in a fiber bundle model has been studied in @xcite . in this paper , we study the breakdown properties of the fiber bundles with els dynamics .",
    "let @xmath21 be the uniform applied load per fiber initially when all fibers are intact .",
    "the total amount of external load is then @xmath30 .",
    "this externally applied load gets distributed within the bundle in a series of @xmath31 successive time steps .",
    "let us denote @xmath32 as the stress per intact fiber after @xmath33-th relaxation step .",
    "since more and more fibers break , the stresses acting through the remaining intact fibers increase . when @xmath21 is the applied load per fiber , all fibers with @xmath34 break .",
    "this stress is now distributed to @xmath35 $ ] intact fibers on the average .",
    "after the first step if @xmath36 is the stress per fiber then @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "consideration of the same mechanism in successive steps one can write : @xmath38 = nx_2[1 - p(x_1 ) ] = nx_3[1 - p(x_2 ) ] .. \\ ] ] this process terminates after @xmath31 steps when the amount of stress released is not sufficient to create further failure of fibers .",
    "if @xmath39 is the applied load per intact fiber in the stable state , then one can write the external load @xmath40 as a function of @xmath39 , which is @xmath41 $ ] @xcite . for a specific value of @xmath42",
    "is maximum which suggests the condition : @xmath43 .",
    "for example , for a uniform distribution of breaking thresholds one gets @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the failure properties of materials are highly dependent on the extent of disorder inherent in them . in the fbms",
    ", this disorder appears in the breaking thresholds of the individual fibers . in this regard ,",
    "the power law distribution of breaking thresholds is an extreme case of heterogeneous disorder , where a large number of fibers have very small breaking thresholds , their numbers decreases as breaking thresholds are increased , leading to few fibers with large breaking thresholds .",
    "it is already known in the literature that the probability of getting a warning of imminent breakdown of the system is higher when the material is more heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "such cases of extremely heterogeneous disorder has not been very well studied in the literature of fiber bundle model .",
    "another form of strong heterogeneity has been studied where a fraction of fibers are completely unbreakable and the breaking thresholds of the rest are drawn from some distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we therefore address the problem of fbms with highly heterogeneous power law distributed breaking thresholds of individual fibers .",
    "as a first step we study the simpler problem of els dynamics in this model , study of the lls version will be taken up in a future publication .",
    "fbms have a wide variety of applications .",
    "it is a versatile tool to understand conceptually the underlying microscopic mechanism of fatigue @xcite , failure of composite materials @xcite , landslides @xcite etc .",
    "moreover , the els version of the fbm studied here may be used to study the traffic jams in roads @xcite .",
    "the traffic flow capacities of the roads can be mapped to the breaking thresholds of individual fibers .",
    "the highly disorder flow rates may occur in a traffic network with few highways and a large number of narrow roads connecting the highways .    in section 2",
    "we describe our study of the fiber bundle model with power law distributed breaking thresholds .",
    "we also describe different analytically obtained results characterizing this bundle and their numerical supports . in section 3",
    "the statistics of avalanche size distribution have been described .",
    "we summarize in section 4 .     per fiber given in eqn .",
    "5 ( solid line ) matches excellently with its numerical estimates ( open circles).,width=264 ]",
    "in this paper we report the results of our study of the breakdown properties of a fiber bundle where the breaking thresholds of the individual fibers are power law distributed . as in other fbms ,",
    "the only source of disorder in our model is the random distribution of breaking thresholds .",
    "therefore , the individual breaking thresholds @xmath26 are drawn from a probability distribution @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "initially @xmath5 uniformly distributed random numbers @xmath47 are drawn within @xmath48 and the breaking threshold @xmath49for the @xmath25-th fiber is assigned .",
    "consequently , the probability distribution takes the form @xmath50 within the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xcite .    here",
    ", we use the same formulation described in section 1 to obtain the breaking strength of the bundle @xmath22 as a function of the cut - off parameter @xmath3 when the breaking thresholds @xmath27 are power law distributed .",
    "the constant of proportionality can be evaluated from the normalization condition , which gives the functional form @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "the cumulative probability distribution is given by , @xmath52 in this case we obtain the expression of @xmath40 as @xmath53.\\ ] ] clearly the function @xmath40 has a maximum at @xmath54 for which @xmath55 .",
    "this yields @xmath56 and the total critical applied load is @xmath57 .",
    "thus the critical initial applied load per fiber is given by @xmath58 let @xmath59 denote the minimum of the breaking thresholds .",
    "since the definition of @xmath60 signifies that a bundle fails completely at this point then , the condition @xmath61 i.e. , @xmath62 fixes the upper bound of @xmath3 denoted as @xmath63 for which the weakest fiber failure leads to the complete breakdown of the bundle .",
    "thus we have the complete expression for @xmath6 :    @xmath64    the above expression for the average critical applied load per fiber @xmath6 for a given value of cut - off parameter @xmath3 is valid only for infinitely large bundles , i.e. , @xmath65 .     on the system size @xmath5 for @xmath66",
    "has been exhibited .",

    "all fibers have the same breaking thresholds equal to unity and therefore @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath3 is small , the minimum breaking threshold is high enough , and very close to unity .",
    "when the external stress per fiber is raised to reach the minimum breaking threshold , it breaks .",
    "the released stress is distributed among the remaining fibers and is sufficient to break all other fibers .",
    "this mechanism , when failure of the weakest fiber ensures the global failure of the entire bundle is analogous to the brittle fracture .",
    "this situation continues till @xmath3 reaches @xmath72 and therefore @xmath6 decreases as the strength of the weakest fiber , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath3 increases further , gradually fibers of high breaking thresholds appear and they take over the control .",
    "consequently , @xmath6 must increase with @xmath3 for large @xmath3 with a minimum at @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is obtained using the condition @xmath75 in eqn .",
    "( 5 ) at @xmath76 , which is twice the value of @xmath72 .",

    "( b ) a collapse of the data of the same three system sizes works excellent when the @xmath3 axis has been suitably scaled.,width=264 ]    numerically @xmath6 is obtained in the following way . for a given value of @xmath3",
    "we first calculate the critical load per fiber @xmath84 for a particular fiber bundle @xmath85 having @xmath5 fibers with a given set of breaking thresholds @xmath27 .",

    "if all these inequalities fail to satisfy then the bundle will no longer support the load , it will break apart . now if @xmath21 is such that it is sufficient to break @xmath92 fibers , then at this stage the bundle will support the load if @xmath93 i.e. , @xmath94b_{(n+1)}^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ] the term in the parenthesis of eqn .",

    "( 6 ) has a maximum at some @xmath92 and if the @xmath21 is raised at this maximum value , the bundle will break immediately .",
    "so the maximum of [ @xmath96@xmath97 determines the critical load per fiber for the bundle @xmath85 .",

    "the numerically obtained data represented by open circles matches very well with the analytical curve.,width=264 ]    we now assume that the average value of the critical load per fiber @xmath4 for a given value of @xmath3 and for the bundle of size @xmath5 converges to a specific value @xmath6 as @xmath65 according to the following form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a critical exponent for the cut - off parameter @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we present a study of the fiber bundle model using equal load sharing dynamics where the breaking thresholds of the fibers are drawn randomly from a power law distribution of the form @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 . tuning the value of @xmath3 continuously over a wide range , </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of the fiber bundle has been studied both analytically as well as numerically . </S>",
    "<S> our results are : ( i ) the critical load @xmath4 for the bundle of size @xmath5 approaches its asymptotic value @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath6 has been obtained analytically as @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and for @xmath10 the weakest fiber failure leads to the catastrophic breakdown of the entire fiber bundle , similar to brittle materials , leading to @xmath11 ; ( ii ) the fraction of broken fibers right before the complete breakdown of the bundle has the form @xmath12 ; ( iii ) the distribution @xmath13 of the avalanches of size @xmath14 follows a power law @xmath15 with @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where the crossover avalanche size @xmath20 . </S>"
