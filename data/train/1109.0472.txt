    "the ` breeding method ' is a well - established and computationally inexpensive procedure for generating perturbations for ensemble integrations  @xcite .",
    "bred vectors ( bvs ) are finite perturbations periodically rescaled to a certain magnitude that have been prominently used in probabilistic weather forecasting with ensembles  @xcite . the breeding method and variants of it",
    "are applied in operative ensemble forecast systems , such as national centers for environmental predictions ( ncep , usa ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "moreover , breeding continues to be a popular tool to study the predictability of a variety of systems such as the baroclinic rotating annulus  @xcite or the atmosphere of mars  @xcite .",
    "different initial bv perturbations all generally tend to become aligned with the fastest growing modes .",
    "if different bvs were globally quasi - orthogonal to each other  @xcite , one might expect they would automatically provide a good sample of the different dominant growing error directions , without the need for additional computation .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that the bv perturbations are often locally rather similar in shape , differing only in sign and amplitude  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a major modification of the bv implementation at ncep has recently been implemented by replacing the bvs given by the ensemble forecast with some ` ensemble transform ' that orthogonalizes the ensemble with respect to the metric defined by the inverse covariance matrix  @xcite .",
    "other metrics can be used and lead to different ensembles of bvs  @xcite .",
    "orthogonalization with respect to a given metric generally enhances the statistical diversity of the ensemble by making the bv perturbations globally more dissimilar  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how the ensemble diversity can be enhanced by using the geometric norm with no further transforms or orthogonalizations needed .",
    "we first show that the bvs dynamics and the statistical properties of the ensemble strongly depend on the norm definition used to construct them .",
    "so far euclidean - type norms are widely used in applications . however , our results demonstrate that , among a spectrum of studied norms , the geometric norm is the most convenient because it provides a greater statistical diversity of the ensemble , while it enhances the projection of the ensemble as a whole on the most unstable direction . with other norm choices , like the standard euclidean one , a good projection on the leading lyapunov vector ( lv )",
    "is always associated with the collapse of all the bvs , i.e.  the complete loss of the ensemble diversity .",
    "we illustrate our study with numerical integrations of the well - known lorenz-96 model  @xcite that has been used by various authors as a low order testbed for atmospheric prediction and assimilation studies @xcite .",

    "for these values the system exhibits well developed chaos  @xcite .",
    "a good description of the chaotic dynamics can be achieved by understanding the behavior of initial infinitesimal perturbations , which are governed by the ` tangent linear model ' : @xmath6 \\nonumber\\\\ - u(x-1,t)\\left[\\delta u(x-2,t)- \\delta u(x+1,t)\\right ] -\\delta u(x , t ) .",

    "obtaining the tangent linear ( and adjoint ) models can be however extremely difficult in operative weather models and one has to resort to analyzing finite perturbations , which are evolved with the full nonlinear model .",
    "this is for instance the situation at ncep , where ensembles of bvs are used .",
    "bvs are finite perturbations obtained after periodic rescaling , say at times @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . a control trajectory @xmath11 and a perturbed one @xmath12 , are simultaneously integrated [ via eq .  ( [ lorenz ] ) ] and at the scheduled times the difference between them",

    "( [ dif])-([pert ] ) , is repeated .",
    "after several breeding cycles , the perturbations generated by this procedure acquire a large growth rate , which makes them suitable for ensemble forecasting .",
    "usually a set of bvs is evolved from different initial random perturbations and this constitutes the ensemble .",
    "ideally a good ensemble of bvs should span the most unstable directions in phase space well enough to capture the main instabilities .",
    "there are three basic ingredients in the definition of the bv : ( i ) the rescaling interval @xmath19 , ( ii ) the perturbation amplitude @xmath14 , and ( iii ) the choice of the norm @xmath20 used in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the rescaling interval @xmath19 has a negligible influence in the results as long as it remains small say , smaller than the doubling time , which is on the order of @xmath21 time units ( t.u . ) for the lorenz-96 model .",
    "we have used @xmath22 t.u . , which corresponds to @xmath23 day in the time scale assumed by  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation amplitude @xmath14 controls the `` finiteness '' of the perturbations ; a sufficiently small @xmath14 makes the perturbation quasi - infinitesimal , and in the limit @xmath24 the bv perfectly aligns with the leading lv of the system .",
    "however , very little is known about the effect of the norm choice on the properties of the resulting ensemble and we discuss this issue in detail in the incoming sections .",
    "the choice of the norm is probably the more obscure element determining the bvs nature .",
    "bvs have often been claimed to be insensitive to the choice of norm  @xcite .",
    "however , this belief is not actually based on any rigorous argument . here",
    "we show that the effect of changing the norm type has a dramatic impact on bvs .",
    "we will show that different norms lead to different ensemble properties and it is not a mere change of the ` ruler ' or metrics .",
    "there are intrinsic and genuine effects on the statistics of the bvs for each particular norm type .",
    "intuitively , for a homogeneous system like the lorenz-96 model , any definition for the norm one wants to use should be homogeneous in the sense that it weights equally all sites . to see why this constraint is relevant",
    "let us consider a particularly illustrative example .",
    "think of a norm arising from some scalar product @xmath25 with a very `` unbalanced '' metric matrix @xmath26 , e.g.  @xmath27 .",
    "this choice would result in very dissimilar bvs depending if the site @xmath28 is more or less unstable at a given time . for a given @xmath14",
    ", at some times the vector dynamics could be infinitesimal - like while at other moments it would be clearly finite . for spatially homogeneous systems ,",
    "it is reasonable to restrict ourselves to  homogeneous  norms that produce a bv that is statistically equivalent up to a high degree at different times and we do so in our study .    in this work",

    "all members of the ensemble are simultaneously rescaled , and they are initiated with independent random initial conditions , which is expected to result in some degree of diversity in the ensemble of bvs @xcite .",
    "we define ensemble diversity as the degree of linear independence or transversality among the ensemble members .",
    "diversity can be quantified by calculating the ` ensemble dimension ' , which measures the effective dimension of the sub - space spanned by the ensemble .",
    "the higher the ensemble dimension the greater the statistical diversity .",
    "higher ensemble dimension would imply larger dissimilarities among the ensemble members .",
    "since bv perturbations tend to align with the fastest growing modes , a greater diversity indicates that the ensemble is able to actually sample not only the main lv but also other , less unstable , directions .",
    "our goal here is to show , by means of several numerical calculations with a simple model , that the 0-norm is more convenient than other norms for constructing ensembles of bvs as far as ensemble diversity enhancement is concerned .",
