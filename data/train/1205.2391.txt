    "characterizing the initial conditions of massive star formation is important for distinguishing between various theoretical models .",
    "for example , mckee & tan ( 2002 , 2003 , hereafter mt03 ) have presented the `` turbulent core accretion model '' , which assumes that massive stars ( including binaries and other low - order multiple systems ) form from massive starless _ cores _ in a manner that can be considered a scaled - up version of the standard theory of low - mass star formation ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) .",
    "the core undergoes global collapse to feed a central accretion disk .",
    "these massive starless cores are also assumed to be near virial equilibrium and in approximate pressure equilibrium with the surrounding _ clump _ environment , whose pressure is likely to be set by the self - gravitating weight of the gas , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass surface density of the clump .",
    "the clump is defined to be the gas cloud that fragments to form a star cluster .",
    "observed regions of massive star formation , including revealed massive star clusters where this activity occurred recently , have high values of @xmath14 ( but with a dispersion of about a factor of 10 ) , implying large values of @xmath15 .",
    "a massive , virialized core in pressure equilibrium with this environment can not be supported by thermal pressure , given observed temperatures of @xmath16  k , and so must be supported by some form of nonthermal pressure , i.e. turbulence or magnetic fields . since massive stars are `` rare '' , in the sense that they constitute only a small mass fraction , @xmath17 , of the observed initial stellar mass function , then massive starless cores that will eventually form massive stars are also expected to be rare .",
    "most massive structures are likely to fragment into clusters of lower - mass stars . we anticipate that preventing fragmentation of massive starless cores likely involves magnetic fields being strong enough such that the core mass is approximately equal to a magnetic critical mass and substructures are magnetically subcritical .",
    "krumholz & mckee ( 2008 ) have argued fragmentation is prevented by radiative heating from surrounding low - mass protostars , which requires them to have high accretion rates and thus for the clump to have a high value of @xmath18 in order to form massive stars .",
    "there is no such constraint if magnetic fields prevent fragmentation .",
    "mt03 modeled massive cores as singular polytropic spheres , with a power law density distribution of @xmath19 .",
    "there were few observational constraints on this density distribution , so mt03 assumed cores were part of a self - similar hierarchy of structure also shared by their surrounding clumps , where observations suggested @xmath20 ( e.g. van der tak et al .",
    "2000 ; beuther et al . 2002 ; mueller et al .",
    "the parameters of a fiducial massive core make it clear why it is difficult to measure the structure observationally . for a @xmath21 core embedded near the center of a clump with mean @xmath22 ,",
    "the radius is @xmath23  pc . at typical distances , @xmath24  kpc",
    ", this radial size corresponds to @xmath25 .    until recently , measurements of mass surface densities of @xmath26 ( equivalent to @xmath27 or @xmath28  mag )",
    "were based mostly on mm dust continuum measurements , which require knowing the dust emissivity , dust temperature and dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "in particular , the dust emissivity and temperature may be expected to vary along the line of sight through a dense cloud . for total power observations with single dish telescopes ,",
    "resolutions have been limited to @xmath29 , e.g. the diffraction limit of a 30  m telescope at 1.2  mm .",
    "rathborne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) carried out a study of this emission from 38  galactic infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) ( these types of clouds are described in more detail below ) .",
    "the above considerations show that we do not expect their results to be able to resolve the scale of individual massive cores in high pressure environments , but are better suited to studying the properties of clumps that might form whole star clusters .",
    "higher angular resolution has been achieved with interferometric observations , but these have been possible only towards relatively limited samples of objects , many of which are already in the process of forming a star ( e.g. bontemps et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the advent of space - based , mir , high - photometric - accuracy , imaging surveys of the galactic plane has opened up a new way to probe high mass surface density structures .",
    "indeed , these cold , high @xmath1 structures were first identified as `` infrared dark clouds '' from analysis of _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; prault et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ midcourse space experiment _",
    "( _ msx _ ; egan et al .",
    "1998 ) imaging data . with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , more precise and higher angular resolution data became available . this led butler & tan ( 2009 , hereafter bt09 or paper i ) to attempt to develop mir extinction ( mirex ) mapping as a precision technique for probing high mass surface density regions .",
    "bt09 adopted the ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) thin ice mantle coagulated ( for @xmath30  yr at densities of @xmath31 or equivalently for @xmath32  yr at densities of @xmath33 ) dust model for their fiducial analysis and a gas - to-(refractory component)-dust mass ratio of 156 ( slightly higher than the value of 141 estimated by draine ( 2011 ) from depletion studies ) . with these values the opacity per unit gas mass in the irac band 4 at @xmath34 of a source with a spectrum typical of galactic diffuse mir emission is @xmath35 .",
    "the fiducial value adopted by bt09 and in this paper is @xmath36 so that @xmath37 from the variety of dust models considered by bt09 , we expect @xmath38 uncertainties in the absolute value of @xmath39 . within a particular irdc , we can expect some systematic variation in @xmath40 due to different degrees of ice mantle growth , but these should be at most @xmath41 ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , and probably much less after averaging over conditions on a line of sight through the cloud .    apart from the choice of mir opacity , there are two main sources of uncertainty involved in mir extinction mapping .",
    "first , the intensity of the mir emission behind the cloud is assumed to be smooth and must be estimated by extrapolation from nearby regions that are assumed to be extinction free .",
    "bt09 estimated that the extrapolation could lead to flux uncertainties of about 10% , corresponding to errors in @xmath42 , given fiducial dust models .",
    "this is a minimum @xmath1 , below which mir extinction mapping becomes unreliable .",
    "these problems of background estimation can be reduced by choosing irdcs that are in regions of the galactic plane where the observed surrounding emission is relatively constant and smooth around the cloud .",
    "one systematic bias that we expect to be present is caused by the fact that there will typically be some cloud material in the `` envelope '' region around the irdc where extinction was assumed to be zero . from studies of co emission around irdcs ( hernandez & tan 2011 ; hernandez et al .",
    "2011 ) we estimate that this envelope typically has @xmath43 .",
    "this is an additional reason why mir extinction mapping becomes unreliable at low values of @xmath1 .",
    "this problem can be addressed by combining mir and nir extinction mapping techniques ( kainulainen et al .",
    "2011 ; kainulainen & tan , in prep . ) the second major source of uncertainty is caused by foreground mir emission along our line of sight to the irdc .",
    "neglecting this causes us to underestimate @xmath44 and thus @xmath1 .",
    "the effect can be minimized by choosing irdcs that are relatively nearby , as was done by bt09 .",
    "bt09 also tried to estimate the expected amount of foreground emission assuming it comes from a smoothly distributed population of small dust grains heated by massive stars that follow an exponential distribution in the galaxy . for a cloud at a distance of @xmath45  kpc at a galactic longitude of @xmath46",
    ", we estimate that 27% of the observed galactic diffuse emission is from material in front of the cloud . for a part of the cloud that has @xmath1 estimated to be @xmath47 in the absence of a foreground correction , applying this correction raises @xmath1 by about a factor of two .",
    "if this foreground correction is not applied then the largest values of @xmath1 that can be derived are only @xmath48 .",
    "this model - dependent estimate of the foreground is quite uncertain and one of the main reasons that bt09 concentrated on nearby irdcs .",
    "poor understanding of the foreground emission is likely to limit the reliability of the mass surface densities and masses of irdcs derived for large samples of objects ( e.g. simon et al .",
    "2006 ; peretto & fuller 2009 ) , especially for the more distant objects .",
    "local heating of small dust grains that then produce mir foreground emission can not be accounted for in the bt09 model of foreground estimation and this can affect even nearby irdcs .",
    "however , choosing relatively quiescent irdcs can help minimize this particular source of uncertainty .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to introduce a new , improved method to measure the intensity of the foreground emission .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ s : method ] we introduce the method of saturation - based mir extinction mapping . in  [ s : results ] we present the results of applying this method to study the structure of 42 massive starless and early - stage core / clumps located in 10 irdcs . in  [ s : discussion ] we discuss the implications of these results for massive star and star cluster formation theories .",
    "the mirex mapping technique requires knowing the intensity of radiation directed towards the observer at a location just behind the cloud of interest , @xmath49 , and just in front of the cloud , @xmath50 .",
    "then for negligible emission in the cloud and a simplified 1d geometry , @xmath51 where the optical depth @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total opacity at frequency @xmath54 per unit gas mass and @xmath1 is the gas mass surface density .",
    "we can not see @xmath49 directly , so it must be estimated by interpolation from surrounding regions .",
    "bt09 tried two main ways to do this using median filters .",
    "the large - scale median filter ( lmf ) method used a square filter of size 13  that was much larger than the irdcs of interest so that the clouds did not significantly depress the estimated median intensity .",
    "this has the advantage of not assuming any prior knowledge about the irdc , but the disadvantage of a coarse angular resolution of background intensity fluctuations . for studying specific irdcs that can be defined as occupying a certain region of the sky , e.g. an ellipse",
    ", we thus introduced the small - scale median filter ( smf ) method . here the size of the filter is set to be one - third of the major axis of the irdc ellipse ( defined by simon et al .",
    "2006 ) , but it is only applied for background estimation outside of the irdc ellipse . inside the ellipse we estimate the background by interpolating from the surrounding background model .",
    "bt09 estimated that the uncertainties in background estimation due to this interpolation were at a level of @xmath55 , which corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "however , because of foreground emission towards the irdc , we actually observe ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) @xmath57 and towards the irdc surroundings , where we are trying to estimate @xmath49 , we actually observe @xmath58 the primary uncertainty in the mirex mapping method of bt09 for larger values of @xmath1 is the estimate of the level of the foreground contribution to the intensity , @xmath59 . in order to increase the method s sensitivity to higher values of mass surface density , we now describe a new , empirical method to estimate this contribution .",
    "if a core has a high enough mass surface density , then it will block essentially all the background emission .",
    "the observed minimum intensity in the cloud will then be approximately equal to the foreground emission and the angular distribution of this intensity may appear to flatten or `` saturate '' .",
    "it is difficult to be certain if an individual dense core is saturated ( as is sometimes assumed if the foreground is simply estimated from the darkest pixel , e.g. ragan et al .",
    "however , we propose that if the minimum intensity is observed to `` be the same '' in two or more `` independent '' cores ( i.e. spatially resolved peaks in @xmath1 ) in the same cloud , then this is very likely due to saturation . in practice ,",
    "by `` be the same '' we adopt the condition to be within @xmath60 of each other , where @xmath61 is the uncertainty in the glimpse 8  @xmath62 intensities of 0.6  mjy  sr@xmath63 ( reach et al .",
    "by `` independent '' we adopt an angular separation of at least 8 i.e. much larger than the @xmath64 fwhm of the spitzer irac @xmath65 psf .",
    "the algorithm for this method is as follows ( see also figure  [ fig : schematic ] ) :    \\1 ) define a region of the sky as the `` irdc '' . following bt09 , we use the ellipses from the catalog of simon et al .",

    "\\3 ) search for all pixels in the irdc with @xmath68 .",
    "if there are pixels meeting this criteria that are independent ( to be conservative we adopt @xmath69 away from the irdc minimum ) , then the irdc is defined to be saturated , all the above pixels are labeled as `` saturated pixels '' , and the following steps are carried out .",
    "\\4 ) the mean value of @xmath66 of the saturated pixels is evaluated , @xmath70 .",
    "we set the foreground intensity ( which includes all sources of emission : galactic , zodiacal and instrumental , battersby et al .",
    "2010 ) to be @xmath71 .",
    "this subtraction is motivated to have @xmath72 and thus give every pixel a finite value of @xmath44 and thus @xmath1 .",
    "if all the `` saturated pixels '' , defined above , really did have negligible values of @xmath50 and had a distribution of intensities that was relatively uniform in the above range , then @xmath73 and our method would be underestimating @xmath59 by @xmath74  mjy / sr .",
    "in fact , we do find for the @xmath75 `` saturated pixels '' in the 10 irdcs of our sample , a mean value of @xmath76  mjy / sr .",
    "thus , we are likely to be underestimating @xmath59 ( overestimating @xmath50 ) by an amount @xmath77  mjy / sr .",
    "this leads to a value of @xmath1 where our measured values are significantly affected by saturation : @xmath78 where @xmath79 so @xmath80 , that is set by @xmath81  mjy / sr . for a typical irdc with @xmath82  mjy / sr , @xmath83  mjy / sr so that @xmath84  mjy / sr , then @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "for a region of such a cloud with a true value of @xmath87 so that @xmath88  mjy / sr , if we have underestimated @xmath59 by @xmath89  mjy / sr , then we would infer @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , for a true @xmath91 , we would infer @xmath92 .",
    "the values of @xmath1(sat ) calculated with @xmath93  mjy / sr for the 10 irdcs in our sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "they range from @xmath1(sat)=0.33 to 0.52@xmath94 as one progresses along the galactic plane towards @xmath95 , where the background is brightest .",
    "an additional uncertainty results from our use of a single effective value of @xmath36 averaged over the _ spitzer _",
    "irac @xmath96 band , weighting by the filter response function , the spectrum of the galactic background and the dust opacity model ( bt09 ) . since these functions vary over this wavelength range ( see fig .  1 of bt09 )",
    ", at large optical depths the actual transmitted intensity will be greater than that predicted , being more dominated by the region of the spectrum with the lowest opacity .",
    "the net effect is an underestimation of the true mass surface density , given the observed ratio of transmitted to incident intensities .",
    "we have investigated the size of this effect by integrating the transfer equation  ( [ eq : radtrans ] ) over the above weighting functions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : satcheck ] ) . for our fiducial dust model ( the moderately coagulated thin ice mantle model of oh94 ) , which has a relatively flat mir opacity law , the effect is small : just a few percent effect up to value of @xmath97 , rising to about a 10% effect by @xmath98 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , fig .",
    "[ fig : satcheck ] also shows the results for the draine ( 2003 ) @xmath99 dust model , more appropriate for the diffuse ism , which has bare grains and stronger variation of opacity across this wavelength range .",
    "now the effect leads to an underestimation of @xmath1 by up to several tens of percent for @xmath100 .",
    "other dust models we have considered , such as the draine ( 2003 ) @xmath101 model , have somewhat smaller underestimation factors .    a further additional systematic uncertainty results from the fact that the foreground intensity will vary across the irdc , especially due to local radiation sources",
    ". the accuracy of the @xmath1 values will be higher in regions closer to the locations of saturated cores , where @xmath59 has been estimated and in irdcs with minimal local heating sources .",
    "following the above algorithm , we find that all 10 irdcs of the bt09 sample exhibit the effects of saturation . in hindsight , this is not too surprising since these clouds were selected to have relatively high contrast against the background .",
    "the @xmath1 maps of the clouds are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : irdc1 ] and [ fig : irdc2 ] .",
    "the properties of these clouds are listed in table 1 , where we also compare their properties to those derived with the smf method of bt09 with the analytic model of foreground estimation . using the saturation - based estimate of foreground emission",
    ", we find @xmath102 and thus @xmath103 has increased in all the clouds .",
    "thus the highest values of @xmath1 that we infer have risen from @xmath104 in bt09 to @xmath105 in this paper .",
    "the mean values , @xmath106 rise by smaller factors , so that the total cloud masses rise by on average a factor of 2.0 . a comparison of the global properties of these irdc with the predictions of theoretical models of the interstellar medium will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the cores we are considering are a subset of those originally identified by rathborne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on their mm dust continuum emission , observed with the iram-30 m telescope at 11  fwhm angular resolution .",
    "bt09 selected 43 cores from the rathborne et al .",
    "sample , excluding those with significant @xmath107 emission and those with low - contrast against the mir background ( i.e. with @xmath108 ) . here",
    ", we have excluded one of the bt09 cores , e4 , because its glimpse image suffers from a diagonal boundary artifact where the intensity of the diffuse emission changes abruptly .",
    "bt09 treated the cores as circular with radii equal to half the reported fwhm diameter of gaussian fits that rathborne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) fitted to their mm continuum images .",
    "these circles were centered at the coordinates estimated by rathborne et al . as discussed in  [ s : results_irdcs ] , we expect our derived values of @xmath1 to be higher ( and more accurate ) than those of bt09 . comparing the core masses of bt09 with those derived here for the same regions , we find they have typically increased by a factor of about 2.2 .    in this paper , we now redefine the core center to be the center of the highest @xmath1 pixel inside the previous core boundary .",
    "if there are two or more adjacent saturated pixels at the core center , then their average position is used to define the center . in fact , 17 of the 42 cores exhibit saturation .",
    "occasionally , after inspecting the @xmath107 glimpse and @xmath109 mipsgal images , we note the presence of mir sources near ( @xmath110 ) the core center .",
    "this occurs in 9 of the 42 cores ( b2 , c6 , c8 , d5 , d6 , d8 , e2 , e3 , i1 ) . in order to focus on massive starless and early - stage cores",
    ", we shift the center to a new , nearby ( @xmath111 ) @xmath1 maximum to avoid any major sources of mir emission within a radius of @xmath112 of the new center .",
    "in several cases ( c4 , d4 , f2 , j1 ) , the @xmath1 map inside the rathborne et al . core boundary does not exhibit a well - defined high @xmath1 peak . in these cases",
    "we select a new core center as close as possible to the rathborne et al .",
    "core : normally this is within a few arcseconds of the boundary , but for f2 it is about 10  outside .",
    "figure [ fig : corea1]a shows the @xmath1 map of core a1 , extracted from the larger image of irdc a , shown in fig .  [ fig : irdc1]a .",
    "pixels suffering from saturation are marked with small white squares .",
    "the core center is marked with a cross .",
    "similar images of all 42 cores are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cores1 ] to [ fig : cores7 ] .",
    "we note that 5 of the irdcs ( b , e , g , h , j ) only have one core that exhibits saturation .",
    "this is possible because the condition to determine if an irdc is saturated is based on independent positions ( separated by at least 8) having the same foreground intensity ( to within @xmath60 ) , rather than requiring 2 cores to meet this condition .",
    "the 42 cores we have selected for analysis are not meant to be a complete census of all the dense regions in these irdcs .",
    "for example , irdc j only has one core selected .",
    "the core @xmath1 maps exhibit complex structure .",
    "it is not easy to define the boundary of a core from its surrounding clump , especially when one recalls we are viewing a 3d structure in projection .",
    "@xmath113(1 - 0 ) data exist for these irdcs via the galactic ring survey ( jackson et al .",
    "2006 ) , but with poor angular resolution ( @xmath114 ) . also , in the cores we expect co to be highly depleted from the gas phase due to freeze - out onto dust grain surfaces .",
    "widespread co depletion has been observed in irdc h by comparing our @xmath1 map with @xmath115 emission observed with the iram-30 m telescope ( hernandez et al .",

    "thus , given the lack of high angular resolution molecular line data for all the cores , here we present a uniform analysis of core structure , based only on the extinction maps .    for simplicity ,",
    "we first make radial profiles of mean total mass surface density , which we refer to as @xmath13 since it includes contribution from the clump ( see below ) , considering a series of annuli extending from the core center with width equal to 1 pixel , i.e. 1.2  .",

    "we extend the radial profiles out to a maximum angular scale equal to that reported by rathborne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on mm dust emission , i.e. a radius equal to one fwhm of their fitted gaussian profile . as we will see , this is generally larger than the scale over which the core can be considered to be a single monolithic object .    for core a1 , figure",

    "before considering a more detailed analysis of the radial structure , it is instructive to first consider the properties of these core / clump objects at a scale where the total mass enclosed is @xmath122 . if all this mass were in a core , then such a core has the potential to form a @xmath123 star , given expected star formation efficiencies of @xmath124 due to protostellar outflows ( tan & mckee , in prep . ) .",
    "note that there is of course no guarantee that all our sources will collapse in this way and on statistical grounds one would not expect them to : most are likely to undergo fragmentation to form lower - mass stars . for core a1 , @xmath121 is enclosed within @xmath125  pc , so at this scale @xmath126 .",

    "thus next we model the cores with a similar power law density structure , @xmath141 but now when comparing to the observed @xmath1 maps we account for the mass surface density of the surrounding clump medium , @xmath142 .",
    "we estimate @xmath143 using the observed value in the annular region from @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the desire to sample a region of the clump that has a scale comparable to the core in both size and mass from a thin , 1.2wide annulus just outside @xmath144 , which generally leads to larger estimated values of @xmath143 . however , we consider that this thin - shell annulus does not sample a large enough region and mass of the clump that , via self - gravity , would be responsible for setting core s surrounding pressure ( see discussion in  [",
    "s : intro ] ) . ] .",

    "if there were , then in these cases we would expect to truncate the power law at the jeans scale in the core . for core a1 , @xmath160 , about 30% times larger than @xmath161 .",

    "however , the relative values of @xmath170 should still give a measure of the best - fitting model .",
    "we place some additional constraints on the fitting .",
    "first , we do not allow the best - fit core to extend beyond neighboring core centers ( from our sample of 42 cores ) .",
    "second , to prevent independent discrete structures that are not part of our core sample from influencing the fitting , we check for a @xmath171 rise in the @xmath172 profile by comparing the annulus before any rise begins to the following local maximum .",
    "if this occurs , we ignore fits beyond the pre - rise annulus , and search inward for a local maximum in @xmath173 and define that to be the best - fit radius ( for example , this occurs in core a3 ) .",
    "third , if more than @xmath174 of an annulus is composed of mir emission pixels , we do not extend the fit any further . in these cases , a prior unaffected annulus with a local maximum in @xmath173 is chosen as the best - fit radius ( this circumstance only arises in core e3 ) . as a result of the above constraints , it is possible that the global minimum of @xmath173 will not be chosen as the `` best - fit '' .",
    "the results for @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 are shown for core a1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : corea1]b .",

    "the mean / median / dispersion values of @xmath196 and @xmath197 are however very similar to those derived at the @xmath122 scale , which suggests that the assumption by mckee & tan ( 2002 ) and mt03 of a self - similar hierarchy of structure from the clumps to core scales is a reasonable one .",

    "[ fig : corea1]a , on these larger scales the assumption of single monolithic and azimuthally symmetric structure becomes less valid .",
    "carrying out the bonnor - ebert analysis for all 42 cores , we find the fits are generally worse than for the power law models .",
    "the best - fitting bonnor - ebert radii are typically larger than those of the power law core models . for these reasons",
    ", we do not consider the bonnor - ebert models further in our discussion .",
    "we have presented a new method to accurately probe mass surface densities in the range @xmath207 to @xmath208 on arcsecond scales in quiescent , infrared dark clouds , some of which are likely to be the sites of future star formation .",
    "the method uses the small - scale median filter method of background interpolation from regions around a defined irdc ( bt09 ) and then estimates the level of foreground emission by seeing if there are _ independent , nearby , saturated cores _ within the irdc .",
    "if so , the foreground level is set equal to that observed towards these saturated regions .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 measurements derived from this mirex mapping depend on the assumed mir dust opacity per unit total mass , but do not depend on the dust temperature , which is a distinct advantage over measurements based on sub - mm / mm dust continuum emission .    focusing on 42 core / clumps within 10 irdcs",
    ", we have tried various methods of characterizing their azimuthally - averaged structure .",
    "our preferred method , following the model of mckee & tan ( 2002 , 2003 ) , involves fitting power law cores surrounded by a clump envelope , which is assumed to have a constant value of @xmath1 that can be estimated from the surrounding region .",
    "we have fitted these models as a function of radius from the core center , deriving an overall best - fit , but also presenting the full results of this radial characterization .",
    "the typical value of the volume density power law index that best describes the cores is @xmath209 .",
    "this is close to the fiducal value of 1.5 adopted by mckee & tan ( 2002 , 2003 ) , who based their choice on previous measurements on the larger , @xmath210parsec , scales of gas clumps .",
    "we find this power law index does not appear to vary significantly with scale ( i.e. between the @xmath121 enclosed mass scale and the best - fit power law plus clump scale ) , nor with other core or clump properties , suggesting the presence of a self - similar hierarchy of structure .    on the scale at which the total projected enclosed mass is @xmath121 , the derived cores have about 50% of this mass . if massive star formation is to occur , then this is the material that has a high probability of being incorporated into the massive star .",
    "these cores have typical radii of @xmath211  pc , masses of @xmath123 , mean mass surface densities of @xmath212 and surrounding clump mass surface densities of similar values . if one regards our method of clump envelope subtraction to be an overestimate , then one can consider the typical properties of the clumps on these scales as being representative of the gas that will form massive stars , i.e. , with @xmath4 and @xmath213 .",
    "the above values of @xmath13 are lower by factors of @xmath214 than the fiducial value of @xmath215 considered by mckee & tan ( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "note , their theoretical model is general and does not require a particular value of @xmath13 , so this difference does not require any physical explanation .",
    "however , krumholz & mckee ( 2008 ) have proposed massive star formation requires @xmath216 , based on a model in which fragmentation of massive cores is prevented by radiative heating from surrounding lower - mass protostars .",
    "the high value of @xmath13 is required so that the lower - mass protostars accrete at high enough rates that they are luminous enough to sufficiently heat the massive core .",
    "since massive star formation occurs relatively rarely , it may be that it occurs preferentially in cores with higher values of @xmath217 and @xmath13 than we have observed for the average of our sample , which we note does show significant dispersion .",
    "however , we consider this unlikely given that we have selected the highest @xmath1 regions from 10  irdcs that show some of the highest contrast against the galactic mir background ( selected from the larger sample of 38  irdcs studied by rathborne et al . 2006 ) .",
    "saturation limits our @xmath1 maps to values of @xmath218 and this may be affecting our ability to find the highest @xmath1 cores .",
    "however , we are excluding the saturated regions when deriving core and clump density profiles and most cores do not exhibit extensively saturated centers .",
    "we expect our choice of mir opacity per unit gas mass may be uncertain by @xmath219 ( see  1 ) , so this by itself is unlikely to explain the relatively low values of @xmath1 that we are deriving compared to the krumholz & mckee ( 2008 ) prediction .",
    "another possibility , is that these cores and clumps will evolve to higher values of @xmath1 before massive star formation occurs .",
    "indeed , the fact that these are ir dark objects suggests that they can not yet be experiencing much radiative heating . however , there is observational evidence for star formation activity in some of these cores .",
    "for example , y. wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) observed water maser emission located 4.31  from the center of core c1 .",
    "k. wang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have reported protostellar outflows from core c2 .    to better compare our irdc core / clump sample with more evolved systems , in figure  [ fig : compare1 ] we show the 42 core / clumps on the @xmath1 versus @xmath220 diagram ( following tan 2007 ) . here , @xmath1 is measured from the total observed mass inside a given radial distance from the core / clump center . in figure  [ fig : compare2 ] we compare these profiles to the properties of the 31 star - forming clumps whose ir and sub - mm dust continuum emission was observed and modeled by mueller et al .",
    "note that these properties depend on the ( 1d ) modeled temperature structure , dust emissivity ( they used the same ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) dust model that we have adopted for our mirex maps ) and gas - to - dust ratio ( we have scaled mueller et al.s masses by a factor 1.56 to be consistent with our adopted gas - to - dust ratio ) .",
    "the irdc cores / clumps overlap only with the lower-@xmath1 range of the star - forming core / clump sample , perhaps indicating there is a ( physically plausible ) evolutionary growth in core / clump density as star formation proceeds .",
    "however , note that many ( indeed most ) star - forming cores and clumps have @xmath221 .",
    "alternatively , the lack of starless high @xmath1 core / clumps may be due to the somewhat smaller volume of the galaxy that we have probed with our nearby irdc sample , compared to the mueller et al . star - forming core / clump sample .",
    "mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found density power law indices of @xmath222 , slightly steeper than our derived values for irdc cores of @xmath209 , but significantly steeper than our value for clumps of @xmath223 .",
    "again , this latter difference may indicate an evolution in cloud properties as star formation proceeds .    considering the above results",
    ", we suggest that the initial conditions of local massive star formation in the galaxy may be better characterized with values of @xmath224 rather than @xmath215 , which would imply smaller accretion rates and longer formation times that the fiducial values of mt03 .",
    "the accretion rate becomes @xmath225 for a core with @xmath226 and a star formation efficiency of 50% , where @xmath227 is the instantaneous protostellar mass and @xmath228 is the final protostellar mass .",
    "the star formation timescale becomes @xmath229    in this case of massive star formation at relatively low values of @xmath1 , we expect fragmentation of the cores is prevented by magnetic fields , i.e. if the core mass is equal to the magnetic critical mass ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath232 are the major and minor axes of the core , @xmath233 is the mean field strength in the core , and @xmath234 is the mean number density of h nuclei .",
    "thus for a core with @xmath235 and @xmath236 , typical of our sample , the condition @xmath237 requires a field strength @xmath238 if cores have some significant magnetic support , then we expect @xmath239 , perhaps @xmath240 , so that the required field strength in eq.([bfield ] ) is then @xmath241 .",
    "such field strengths are similar to those observed in regions of active massive star formation ( e.g. crutcher 2005 ) . indeed ,",
    "crutcher ( 2005 ) noted the observed mass to flux ratios scattered about the critical value .",
    "numerical simulations of the collapse of marginally magnetically critical ( rather than super critical , e.g. wang et al . 2010 ; hennebelle et al .",
    "2011 ) cores are required to investigate this scenario for forming massive stars , and , more generally , for explaining the high - mass tail of the initial mass function ( kunz & mouschovias 2009 ) .",

    "<S> we then characterize the structure of 42 massive starless and early - stage cores and their surrounding clumps , selected from 10 infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , measuring @xmath3 from the core / clump centers . </S>",
    "<S> we first assess the properties of the core / clump at a scale where the total enclosed mass as projected on the sky is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we find these objects have a mean radius of @xmath5  pc , mean @xmath6 and , if fit by a power law density profile @xmath7 , a mean value of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume a core is embedded in each clump and subtract the surrounding clump envelope to derive the core properties , we find a mean core density power law index of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we repeat this analysis as a function of radius and derive the best - fitting power law plus uniform clump envelope model for each of the 42 core / clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the cores have typical masses of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and are embedded in clumps with comparable mass surface densities . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider bonnor - ebert density models , but these do not fit the observed @xmath1 profiles as well as power laws . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude massive starless cores exist and are well - described by singular polytropic spheres . </S>",
    "<S> their relatively low values of @xmath1 and the fact that they are ir dark may imply that their fragmentation is inhibited by magnetic fields rather than radiative heating . comparing to massive star - forming cores and clumps , there is tentative evidence for an evolution towards higher densities and steeper density profiles as star formation proceeds . </S>"
