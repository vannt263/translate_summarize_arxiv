    "a remarkable example of gauge theory in condensed matter physics is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the latter is invariant towards both global @xmath6 rotations of the order parameter field @xmath7 and local gauge transformations ( rotations ) of the same field and the vector potential @xmath8 of the magnetic induction @xmath9 .",
    "these two properties of gauge invariance define the global and local @xmath10(1 ) symmetries of the gl theory . in both cases",
    "the gauge group is a one - dimensional abelian continuous group , @xmath10(1 ) .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of these global and local symmetries below the phase transition point allows for the appearance of the superconducting phases : the uniform meissner phase and , under certain circumstances , the mixed ( abrikosov vortex  @xcite ) phase . while the meissner phase [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 is a mere product of the breaking of the global @xmath10(1 ) symmetry , the vortex phase [ @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where the equilibrium field configurations of both the order parameter field @xmath7 and magnetic induction @xmath15 are spatially nonuniform , is a result of the spontaneous breaking of local @xmath10(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the local gauge is important also for the description of the magnetic field penetration in both meissner and vortex phases .",
    "this penetration is described by an additional characteristic length , the london penetration length  @xcite , which is different from zero only when the symmetry is broken , i.e. , in the ordered phases , where the equilibrium value of @xmath16 is different from zero .",
    "the local @xmath10(1 ) symmetry is present when the superconductor is in external magnetic field , or , when this field is equal to zero but magnetic fluctuations exist and give sense of the vector potential @xmath8 as purely fluctuating field .",
    "the fluctuations of the relevant fields , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in usual superconductors are small and can be neglected .",
    "this means that the gl functional can be investigated in the lowest order mean field ( mf ) approximation ( alias , `` tree approximation ''  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the usual way of treatment of the gl free energy , in particular , the investigation of the gl equations  @xcite . within the tree approximation ,",
    "the phase transition from normal to superconducting state in zero magnetic field is of second order  @xcite . for a long time",
    "this phase transition has been considered as one of the best examples of second order phase transitions , which has an excellent description within mf .",
    "but in 1974 halperin , lubensky and ma ( hlm )  @xcite showed that the magnetic fluctuations change the order of the superconducting phase transition in a zero external magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) , i.e. , the order of the phase transition from normal - to - uniform ( meissner ) superconducting state at @xmath18 ( see , also ref .",
    "since then this fluctuation change of the order of normal - to - superconducting phase transition ( _ hlm effect _ ) has been under debate . after 1974 an overwhelming amount of theoretical research on this topic has been performed but up to now there is no complete consensus about the order of this phase transition . in this review we shall consider some aspects of this problem but we shall not be able to discuss or mention all relevant contributions . however , it is important to emphasize that the investigation of the properties of the superconducting phase transition is important for other areas of physics , too .",
    "here we shall briefly enumerate and discuss several examples .      in elementary particle physics the gauge invariant theory similar to the gl theory of superconductivity",
    "is called abelian higgs model  @xcite . the same global @xmath10(1 ) and local @xmath10(1 ) gauge symmetries are present but the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of symmetry occurs only for imaginary mass of the higgs ( @xmath19 ) field , which is the analog of the field @xmath16 describing the cooper pair in a superconductor . in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking this model would describe an ordinary electrodynamics of charged scalars , but the situation becomes more interesting when the mentioned mass is imaginary and the breaking of symmetry occurs .",
    "now the symmetry breaking phenomena receive other names and another physical interpretation .",
    "the breaking of both global and local gauge symmetries ensures a mechanism of transformation of the two initial scalar fields  analogs of the components @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the complex field @xmath22 , and two massless photon fields  analogs of the two independent components @xmath23 of the vector potential @xmath24 in a superconductor , to four massive particle fields : the so - called higgs boson , which is analog of the spontaneous order @xmath25 in a superconductor , and three massive vector field components , i.e. a massive three dimensional vector field .",
    "the mass of this new vector field is proportional to the electric charge @xmath26 and magnitude @xmath27 of the higgs field and , as a matter of fact , this is exactly the way , in which the london penetration length in a superconductor depends on the electron charge @xmath28 and the modulus @xmath27 of the superconducting order parameter @xmath16 .",
    "thus the spontaneous breaking of the local gauge symmetry leads to the formation of massive particles without spoiling the gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "this is called `` the higgs mechanism '' .",
    "the latter plays a fundamental role in the unified theory of electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that there is something quite common between the phenomena of spontaneous breaking of the continuous symmetries in superconductivity theory and in quantum field theory .",
    "the superconducting phase @xmath29 is the exact analog of the higgs boson in the abelian - higgs model , whereas the appearance of a massive vector field has its analog in the finite london penetration length , mentioned above .",
    "of course , there is no obstacles in interpreting the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory as phase transitions by taking the higgs mode mass as tuning parameter .",
    "the phase transition will occur at zero mass of the higgs boson .",
    "a similar phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of both global @xmath10(1 ) and local gauge symmetries is possible also within the scalar electrodynamics due to mass insertions from the radiation corrections , as shown in ref .",
    "the radiation corrections , analog of the magnetic fluctuations in a superconductor , generate an imaginary mass to the initially massless scalar field in this theory and the latter becomes very like the abelian - higgs model . here",
    "the symmetry breaking leads to the appearance of a massive scalar and vector fields describing neutral scalar meson and vector meson , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the radiation corrections to the lagrangian of the massless scalar electrodynamics  @xcite resembles very much , in particular , in their mathematical form at @xmath30 , the magnetic fluctuation corrections to the gl free energy of 4d superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the interrelationships between the superconductivity theory and the gauge theories of elementary particles has been comprehensively discussed in ref .",
    "note also the interrelationship between the gl functional of superconductivity and the @xmath31 confinement model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and extensions to non - abelian theories  @xcite .",
    "the gauge theories , mentioned so far , and their extensions have a wide application in the description of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "another interesting gauge theory is that of the nematic - to - smectic _ a _ phase transition in liquid crystals . according to the kobayashi - mcmillan - de gennes theory  @xcite the smectic-_a _",
    "order is described by two order parameters : the nematic director vector and the complex scalar describing the center of masses of the long molecules .",
    "when a description , quite analogous to that of superconductors , is introduced , as suggested by de gennes  @xcite , the director vector is substituted with a gauge vector field , which is quite similar to the vector potential @xmath32 in the gl functional .",
    "apart from some specific features intended to take into account the liquid crystal anisotropy , the effective free energy of the smectic a looks very like the gl free energy of superconductors ( see , also , refs .",
    "another gauge theory in condensed matter physics that has some ( but not very close ) similarity with the gl free energy of superconductors is the chern - simons - ginzburg - landau ( csgl ) effective functional of the quantum hall liquid state , in particular , in the description of the phase transitions between the plateaus in the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "let us mention also the liquid metallic hydrogen , where the problem of the superconducting - to - superfluid phase transition  @xcite is also related to the topics , discussed in this review .",
    "now we shall focus on the fluctuation effects on the properties of the normal - to - superconducting phase transition in zero external magnetic field , which is the subject of the present review and in particular cases we shall refer to related topics in other natural systems .",
    "we shall consider in more details the hlm effect in 2d and quasi-2d superconductors with a special emphasis on the problem of the theoretical predictions reliability .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we shall use two theoretical methods .    in sec .",
    "ii we use the mf like approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite where the spatial fluctuations of superconducting order parameter @xmath16 are neglected , and the magnetic fluctuations are taken into consideration .",
    "this treatment was justified for well established type i superconductors , where the london penetration length @xmath33 is much smaller than the coherence ( correlation ) length @xmath34 . due to the neglecting of spatial fluctuations of @xmath16",
    ", the results of such mf treatment should be valid outside the ginzburg critical region  @xcite .",
    "a weakly first order phase transition occurs as a result of new small @xmath35-term , which appears in the effective free energy of 3d superconductors within the framework of the mf like approximation  @xcite . but",
    "this hlm effect was found to be very small and experimentally unobservable even for well established type i bulk ( 3d- ) superconductors , such as al , where the gl number @xmath36 .",
    "it has been recently shown  @xcite that the hlm effect is much more strong in quasi-2d superconductors than in bulk ( 3d ) samples . moreover , as shown in this series of papers , the effect appears by a term of type @xmath37 in the effective free energy , and essentially depends on the thickness @xmath38 of quasi-2d superconducting films .",
    "these circumstances provide a real opportunity for an experimental verification of the effect  a topic of discussion throughout the present review , and in particular , in sec .",
    "we must emphasize that mf results are not valid for thermodynamic states in the ginzburg critical region @xmath39 around the equilibrium phase transition point @xmath40 . in certain classes of high - temperature superconductors",
    "the ginzburg region exceeds @xmath41k whereas in usual low - temperature superconductors it is very narrow , @xmath42  k , and the respective critical states are experimentally unaccessible ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "if the metastability states , which go along with the weakly first order phase transition predicted by mf , extend over temperature intervals larger than the size of the ginzburg region , one may conclude that the mf prediction of the hlm effect is reliable . in sec .",
    "ii we justify the mf analysis reliability for element superconductors as al , w , in .",
    "we will show that the condition for enough wideness of metastability regions is quite strong and , perhaps , irrelevant in experiments .",
    "we will also demonstrate that the magnitude of the critical magnetic field is crucial for the observability of the hlm effect in thin superconducting films ( see also the discussion in sec .",
    "ii.9 ) .    in sec .",
    "iii we review some results for the hlm effect obtained with the help of the renormalization group ( rg ) method  @xcite .",
    "the latter allows simultaneous treatment of both superconducting and magnetic fluctuations in the asymptotically close vicinity of the phase transition point .",
    "the lack of fixed point of the one - loop rg equations for conventional superconductors in zero external magnetic field was interpreted as a signal for a fluctuation - driven first order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this result shows that the local gauge magnetic fluctuations are relevant also in the ginzburg region of strong @xmath16-fluctuations and under certain circumstances they can change the order of the phase transition to a weakly first order , as is outside the critical region .",
    "the rg investigations of the superconducting phase transition order in zero magnetic field has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "while the latter review emphasizes the investigation of the hlm effect in high orders of the loop expansion  @xcite , here we lay stress on rg results for the effects of anisotropy , quenched disorder and extended symmetries of the higgs @xmath16-field on the phase transition properties .",
    "the rg study of unconventional superconductors will also be discussed . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall consider mainly the phase transition to the superconducting state but results for other systems and related topics will also be mentioned in brief ; see sec .",

    "( [ eq3 ] )  -  ( [ eq4 ] ) can be used for uniform @xmath56 when @xmath70 - fluctuations are neglected . in the prevailing part of our study",

    "we neglect the irregular part @xmath78 and set @xmath79 , then @xmath9 contains only a fluctuation part @xmath80 that describes the diamagnetic variations of @xmath81 around the zero value @xmath82 due to fluctuations @xmath83 of the ordering field @xmath7 above @xmath84 and below @xmath85 the normal - to - superconducting transition at @xmath40 .",
    "note , that the non - fluctuation part @xmath86 $ ] corresponds to the regular part @xmath87 of @xmath9 in nonmagnetic superconductors @xmath88 in zero external magnetic field @xmath89 .",

    ". this interaction can be of type @xmath92 and @xmath93 and generates all effects discussed in the paper .",
    "we accept periodic boundary conditions for the superconductor surface .",
    "this means to ignore the surface energy including the additional energy due to the magnetic field penetration in the surface layer of thickness equal to the london penetration depth @xmath94 ; @xmath95 is the `` zero - temperature '' value of @xmath33 .",
    "this approximation is adequate for superconductors of thickness @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the lattice constant and @xmath98 .",
    "as we suppose the external magnetic field to be zero @xmath99 or very small in real experiments , the requirement @xmath100 can be ignored and we have the simple condition @xmath101 .    in microscopic models of periodic structures the periodic boundary conditions confine the wave vectors @xmath102 in the first brillouin zone @xmath103 $ ] and the expansion of their values beyond this zone can be made either by neglecting the periodicity of the crystal structure or on the basis of the assumption that large wave numbers @xmath104 have a negligible contribution to the calculated quantities .",
    "the last argument is widely accepted in the phase transition theory , where the long - wavelength limit @xmath105 can be used . in particular , this argument is valid in the continuum limit @xmath106 . therefore , for both crystal and nonperiodic structures we can use the cutoff @xmath107 and afterwards extend this cutoff to infinity , provided the main contributions in the summations over @xmath108 come from the relatively small wavenumbers @xmath109 .",
    "this is in fact a quasimacroscopic description based on the gl functional  ( 1 ) , which means that the microscopic phenomena are excluded from our consideration .",

    "for the same reason @xmath128 is complex number .",
    "the functional ( 1 ) is invariant under global @xmath10(1 ) rotations , defined by @xmath129 , where the angle @xmath130 does not depend on the spatial vector @xmath131 , and under the local @xmath10(1 ) gauge transformations @xmath132 $ ] , @xmath133 .",
    "according to the discussion in sec .",
    "i , we have to investigate the spontaneous breaking of these symmetries , that is , the ordered phases and the phase transitions in the superconductor .",
    "the hlm effect , on which we are going to focus the attention , is one of the results of the local @xmath10(1 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "while the effect of the superconducting fluctuations @xmath134 on the phase transition properties is very weak , as in usual superconductors , and is restricted in a negligibly small vicinity @xmath135 of temperature @xmath40 , we will assume that @xmath136 , i.e. , @xmath137 ; from now on we will denote @xmath138 by @xmath16 .",
    "so we apply the mean - field approximation with respect to the order parameter @xmath139 . within this approximation",
    "we will take into account the @xmath140-fluctuations for @xmath141 , i.e. , @xmath142 .",

    "the partition function @xmath147 corresponds to an effective free energy @xmath148 of the @xmath0-dimensional system : @xmath149 the magnetic fluctuations will be completely taken into account , if only we are able to solve exactly the integral  ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the exact solution can be done for a uniform order parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the uniform value of @xmath16 is different from the mean - field value of @xmath16 , because the uniform fluctuations of @xmath7 always exist , so we should choose one of these two possibilities  @xcite .",
    "the problem of this choice arises after calculating the integral  ( [ eq8 ] ) at the next stage of consideration when the effective free energy @xmath148 is analyzed and the properties of the superconducting phase @xmath150 are investigated . the effective free energy is a particular case of the effective thermodynamic potential in the phase transition theory  @xcite and we must treat the uniform @xmath16 in the way prescribed in the field theory of phase transitions .",
    "it will become obvious from the next discussion that we will use a loop - like expansion , which can be exactly summed up to give a logarithmic dependence on @xmath27 .    due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global @xmath10(1 ) continuous symmetry of the ground state @xmath151 , the effective free energies discussed in this section depend on the modulus @xmath27 of the complex number @xmath152 but not on the phase angle @xmath153 , which remains arbitrary .",
    "that is why we will consider the modulus @xmath27 as an `` effective order parameter '' as the angle @xmath153 does not play any role in the phenomena investigated in this section .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 remains undetermined up to the stage when we define the equilibrium order parameter @xmath154 by the equation of state @xmath155 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this equation gives the equilibrium value @xmath156 of @xmath16 and the difference @xmath157 - @xmath158 can be treated as the uniform ( zero dimensional ) fluctuation of the field @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath131-dependent fluctuations @xmath159 have been neglected because of the uniformity of @xmath16 .",
    "the solution @xmath156 will be stable towards the uniform fluctuation @xmath160 , provided the same solution @xmath161 corresponds to a stable ( normal or superconducting ) phase ; the phase angle @xmath162 remains unspecified .",
    "we begin our investigation by setting @xmath16 uniform but at some stage we will also ignore the uniform fluctuation @xmath163 and deal only with the equilibrium value @xmath156 of @xmath16 .",
    "the equilibrium value will be calculated after taking into account magnetic fluctuations , so it will be different from the usual result @xmath164  @xcite where both magnetic and superconducting fluctuations are ignored .",
    "this simplest approximation for the equilibrium value of @xmath16 is obtained from the gl free energy  ( 1 ) , provided @xmath165 and the gradient term is neglected .",
    "hereafter we will keep the symbol @xmath154 for the equilibrium order parameter in the more general case when the magnetic fluctuations are not neglected and will denote the same quantity for @xmath166 by @xmath167 .",
    "the above described approximation neglects the saddle point solutions of gl equations , where @xmath168 is @xmath131-dependent .",
    "therefore , the vortex state that is stable in type ii superconductors can not be achieved .",
    "this is consistent with setting the external magnetic field to zero , so the vortex state can not occur in any type superconductor .",
    "these arguments can be easily verified with the help of gl equations  @xcite for zero external magnetic field ; the only nonzero solution for @xmath16 in this case is given by @xmath169 although the magnetic fluctuations @xmath170 are properly considered .",

    "the metastability temperature interval is relatively larger for smaller values of the gl number @xmath438 , but in order to ensure large values of some measurable thermodynamic quantities as , for example , the latent heat @xmath451 and the specific heat capacity @xmath459 we must choose a material with large critical field @xmath460 . the experimental verification of the order parameter jump can be made by transport experiments . as we see from figs .  2 - 4 and table 2 , this quantity has maximal values for w , where the parameter @xmath438 is very small . having in mind also the large metastability regions in this material , one may conclude that w is a good candidate for a testing the hlm effect by transport experiments ( measurements of the superconducting currents ) , provided some specific disadvantages of this material ( quite low @xmath40 , etc . ) from the experimental point of view do not contradict to this our conclusion .",

    "in further papers the same authors and co - workers confirm  @xcite our results , published in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discussed in this section .",
    "another paper has been intended to the treatment of gauge effects in superconductors with the help of a gaussian effective functional  @xcite , which gives results quite near to mean - field ones , and is wrong within the present discussion .",
    "the rg methods are intended to investigation the strong fluctuation interactions in the critical region of second order phase transitions and multi - critical phenomena  @xcite . in studies of complex systems with several orderings or with influence of additional gauge fields , as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , usually the @xmath463space rg methods are used because of their wider applicability .",
    "the methods differ from each other in specific technical details but all of them lead to the same predictions about the phase transition properties .",
    "the common feature is that the mentioned methods are based on the so - called loop expansion  @xcite .",
    "the rg equations are , in fact , infinite asymptotic series , which are truncated at one- , two- , or , in rare cases , higher orders in the loop expansion .",
    "the total infinite series can be summed only in case of trivial ( usually exactly soluble ) models and in some very exceptional cases as , for example , the rg series for interacting real bosons in the quantum limit @xmath464  @xcite .    for the simple @xmath465theory",
    "the rg series can be derived and analyzed to high orders in the loop expansion whereas for more complex models this can be practically done within the one- and two - loop approximations .",
    "as the rg series are asymptotic , normally , the one- and two - loop orders give all important features of the specific system of interest : ( i ) the presence of stable fixed points ( fp ) of the rg equations and the associated with them types of critical behavior , and ( ii ) the lack of stable fps and related conclusions about the lack of standard critical or multi - critical behavior .",
    "the higher orders of the theory are more relevant to investigations of the asymptotic properties of the loop series than for obtaining of qualitatively new critical behavior , or , other new qualitative characteristics of the system .",

    "the lack of stable fp is an indication for a lack of standard second order phase transition .",
    "but usually , additional ( non - rg ) arguments are needed to determine the actual order of the phase transition . in the present case ,",
    "the lack of stable fp could be a result of the same mechanism that produces a fluctuation - driven weakly first order phase transition in mf approximation ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "as rg takes into account both fluctuations of @xmath16 and @xmath32 , one can conclude that the result for the weakly - first order phase transition in zero external magnetic field is valid for both type i and ii superconductors .",
    "of course , the size of the effect ( the size of jumps of energy , latent heat , order parameter ) will depend on the specific substance .",
    "this path of investigations has been further developed in the paper  @xcite , and several problems opened in the short ref .",

    "@xcite , where both 2d and 3d superconductors are considered , the hlm effect has been confirmed in one - loop order ( annealed disorder  @xcite ) as well as the availability of second order phase transition for large_n _ has been proven in another variant of the hartree limit ( @xmath477 ) .",
    "next , the effect has been confirmed in a rg investigation of the equation of state below the phase transition point @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "these investigations show that the effect may occur under quite restricted conditions for the vertex parameters @xmath478 and @xmath431 of the functional ( 1 ) , in particular , the effective charge @xmath479 exceeds some value . a strong restriction on the hlm effect , but in an opposite direction - a requirement for a sufficiently small effective electric charge @xmath479 , has been found also by a monte carlo ( mc ) study  @xcite of a lattice version of the model ( 1 ) .",
    "another mc study  @xcite concludes that at fixed effective charge ( @xmath480 ) the hlm effect strongly depends on the gl parameter @xmath481 : it is well established for @xmath355 , becomes very weak for @xmath482 and vanishes for large @xmath438 . on the basis of this picture",
    "a proposal is made  @xcite for the existence of a tricritical point at some `` tricritical '' value of @xmath438 .",
    "as @xmath438 is related with the charge @xmath478 , this proposal seems to be in a conformity with other investigations .",
    "note , that the first prediction for change of the phase transition order with the variation of @xmath438 and for the possibility of  tricritical point  to appear at some value of @xmath438 , has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of duality arguments  @xcite and analytical calculations ; see further development of this approach in refs .",
    "a further mc study  @xcite of type ii superconductors indicates that these systems undergo a second order phase transition of universality class 3d _ xy _ rather than a weakly first order phase transition .",
    "the two - loop rg studies  @xcite show that the account of higher orders of the loop expansion allows a lowering of the critical value @xmath483 but the rg equations still have no real fp at @xmath484 and @xmath472 ( conventional 3d superconductors ) , except for a treatment by pad analysis  @xcite ( see , also , the review  @xcite ) . in @xmath485 dimensions ,",

    "the specific feature of this approach is that the disorder is associated with the vector gauge field @xmath8 and can be used to describe superconductors in random , uncorrelated , or , which is the same , short - range ( @xmath146- ) correlated magnetic fields rather than usual ones . in high energy physics",
    "this approach makes contact with gauge fields where a higgs field is coupled to a random color field .",
    "it is natural to expect , as has been proven  @xcite , that the annealed gauge model will bring a fluctuation - driven first order phase transition at usual symmetry indices and a second order phase transition in the hartree limit ( @xmath491 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the phase transition in case of quenched impurities has been predicted to be of second order in a calculation to one - loop order , in contradiction to the conclusion for a lack of stable nontrivial fp of the rg equations within the same one - loop order  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is clear from the argument that the lack of stable fp may result without any change of the hamiltonian structure , whereas the conclusion for a second order of the transition in ref .",
    "@xcite has been made , perhaps , incorrectly , based on the argument of the absence of @xmath492-term for @xmath291 and of the absence of @xmath37-term for @xmath290 .",
    "more usual case of quenched disorder in abelian - higgs models has been considered in refs .",
    "this is the case when the parameter @xmath493 in ( 1 ) has a random part , which obeys a gaussian distribution .",
    "this disorder is of type random impurities , or , what is the same ,  random critical temperature  @xcite . in case of the so - called  uncorrelated  , or , ( @xmath146- )",

    "the situation for long range random correlations is more complicated and here we will advice the reader to follow the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", the annealed disorder leaves the phase transition properties almost identical to those in the pure abelian - higgs model ( 1 ) whereas the quenched disorder gives a lower critical values of the symmetry index @xmath469 , below which the weakly first order phase transition ( hlm effect ) exists .",
    "thus one may conclude that the quenched disorder acts in a direction ofsmearing  the fluctuation - driven first order phase transition , i.e. the hlm effect seems to be much weaker in such systems .",
    "the first theoretical study of the hlm effect on the properties of the nematic - smectic @xmath502 phase transition in liquid crystals has been performed in refs .",
    "the main result of these investigations is the confirmation of the hlm effect in a close vicinity of this liquid crystal phase transition . perhaps , because of the liquid crystal anisotropy , which explicitly enters in the propagator of the gauge field  @xcite , here the critical value @xmath503 of the symmetry index _ n _ , below which the weakly first order transition occurs , is lower than in pure superconductors @xmath504 but it is still quite above the real value @xmath472 .",
    "thus the rg predictions in refs .",
