    "historically , capillarity problems attracted attention because of their applications in physics , for instance in the study of wetting phenomena @xcite , energy minimizing drops and their adhesion properties @xcite , as well as because of their connections with minimal surfaces , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",

    "although there are results in the literature describing the static and dynamic behaviours of droplets @xcite , not too much seems to be known concerning their mean curvature motion .",
    "various results have been obtained for mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces with dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite and zero - neumann boundary condition @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to recall that , when the contact angle is constant , the evolution is related to the so - called mean curvature flow of surface clusters , also called space partitions ( networks , in the plane ) : in two dimensions local well - posedness has been shown in @xcite , and authors of @xcite derived global existence of the motion of grain boundaries close to an equilibrium configuration .",
    "see also @xcite for related results . in higher space dimensions",
    "short time existence for symmetric partitions of space into three phases with graph - type interfaces has been derived in @xcite .",

    "short time existence describes the motion only up to the first singularity time . in order to continue the flow through singularities",
    "one needs a notion of weak solution .",
    "concerning the case without boundary , there are various notions of generalized solutions , such as brakke s varifold - solution @xcite , the viscosity solution ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the almgren - taylor - wang @xcite and luckhaus - sturzenhecker @xcite solution , the minimal barrier solution ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; see also @xcite for other different approaches .    in the present paper",
