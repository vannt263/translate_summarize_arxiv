    "<S> a recent updated version of the lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics is reviewed , in which the momentum dependence of symmetry potential and the effective mass splitting of proton and neutron in nuclear medium are included in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) elastic cross sections are evaluated with the scaling approach according to the effective mass and their influence on collective flows in heavy - ion collisions are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic cross sections , in particular for the process of the channel n@xmath0nn , are parameterized in accordance with the available experimental data . it is found that the in - medium cross sections play a significant role on isospin emissions and result in a flat distribution for transverse flows and elliptic flows of free nucleons comparing with the in - vacuum ones . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity distribution of the difference between neutron and proton transverse flows is sensitive to the stiffness of nuclear symmetry energy as a promising observable , which can not be influenced by the in - medium effect and collision centrality . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the elliptic flow of free energetic nucleons in the case of the mass splitting of @xmath1 is also related to the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pion flows weakly depend on the symmetry energy and the mass splitting .    </S>",
