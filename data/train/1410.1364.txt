    "instruments flown on balloon - borne and earth - orbiting satellites experience radiation from a wide range of particles with a galactic , solar , magnetospheric or atmospheric origin @xcite .",
    "the neutron component is mainly produced in cosmic ray induced showers in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the production energies for neutrons range from @xmath00.1 mev to @xmath010 s of gev . after production",
    "the neutrons are thermalised due to scattering interactions with atmospheric nuclei , resulting in an energy spectrum ranging from ev energies up to 10 s of gev .",
    "the non - thermal component of this neutron spectrum is an important source of background for experiments making use of detection materials with low atomic numbers , e.g. plastic scintillators .",
    "examples include x - ray polarimeters operating on balloon experiments , see for example @xcite,@xcite , in earth orbiting satellites @xcite , or balloon - borne compton telescopes @xcite .",
    "a second source of measurement background , found in a wider range of experiments , stems from neutron - induced activation of both active and passive materials in the detector @xcite .",
    "reducing the neutron - induced background through active shielding is inefficient due to the non - ionizing behaviour of neutrons , while passive shielding from neutrons results in a significant mass increase of the payload . as a result",
    "an irreducible and variable background resulting from neutrons is often unavoidable . during the design phase of the instrument an understanding of the incoming neutron flux",
    "is therefore needed to optimise the signal to background of the experiment .",
    "the spectral shape and the energy integrated flux of atmospheric neutrons varies strongly with altitude .",
    "the energy integrated flux has additional dependencies on the magnetic latitude and solar activity . for earth orbiting satellites and long duration balloon experiments the latitude ,",
    "solar activity and altitude may not be constant during the mission , resulting in a variable neutron - induced background rate .",
    "an understanding of how the neutron flux and spectral shape changes throughout the mission is therefore important .",
    "the neutron flux is largest and most influenced by solar activity in the polar regions , where long duration stratospheric balloon flights are conducted @xcite .",
    "recently published studies have verified that the atmospheric neutron environment can be simulated accurately using different monte carlo packages , see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the monte carlo based packages planetocosmics @xcite and a combination of geant4 @xcite and mcnp @xcite are used respectively in @xcite and @xcite to simulate the neutron flux dependent cosmogenic nuclei production rates .",
    "the neutron production rates are simulated for a more general purpose using geant4 @xcite , phits @xcite and a combination of corsika @xcite , mcnp @xcite and mcnpx @xcite respectively in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular the work presented in @xcite provides a look - up table for neutron spectra at particular altitudes , all cut - off rigidities and all solar activities , which are shown to match spectra as measured on ground and on high altitude flights . in @xcite analytical functions",
    "are furthermore provided describing the neutron energy spectra over a wide energy range for altitudes below @xmath1 .",
    "also in @xcite the results are shown to be in good agreement with spectra measured on ground and at flight altitudes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a relatively simple model which provides the spectrum of the non - thermal neutron component , for all altitudes exceeding @xmath2 , which can easily be implemented in , for example , geant4 based simulations of balloon - borne and earth - orbiting instruments .",
    "such a model can , for example , be used to study the effect of variations in position and solar activity on the neutron flux impinging on an astrophysics experiment . for this purpose",
    "a monte carlo data based set of equations describing the atmospheric neutron flux in the energy range of @xmath3 to @xmath4 for altitudes exceeding @xmath2 , all magnetic latitudes and all solar activities is presented .",
    "the directional dependency of the neutron flux on altitude and energy is of additional importance , especially for balloon - borne experiments .",
    "the direction of momentum is therefore included in the model .",
    "section 2 provides a brief overview of the atmospheric neutron environment .",
    "this is followed by a description of the performed monte carlo simulations in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the results of these simulations and the resulting parametrised model and comparisons with results from other models and measurement data .",
    "the energy spectrum is divided into an upward and downward moving component in section 5 .",
    "finally section 6 discusses the neutron environment specifically for high latitude balloon - borne instruments using a comparison with data from a purpose - built neutron detector .",
    "the majority of atmospheric neutrons are produced in hadronic air showers induced by cosmic ray protons or helium nuclei @xcite .",
    "a second source is electromagnetic air showers induced either by cosmic gamma rays or electrons .",
    "the hadronic component of electromagnetic showers in which neutrons are produced is , however , small .",
    "atmospheric neutrons can also be produced by radioactivity in the earth .",
    "due to the high atmospheric density at low altitudes , which results in a relatively short mean free path for these neutrons , the contribution from the earth is only relevant in the lower part of the troposphere .",
    "only production through hadronic air showers is therefore considered here .    within hadronic air showers the highest energy neutrons",
    "are produced by charge - exchange interactions between cosmic ray nuclei and atmospheric nuclei @xcite .",
    "the resulting neutrons will carry approximately the momentum of the incoming protons , and will therefore preferentially move downwards in the atmosphere .",
    "the cross section for this process is not relevant at sub - gev energies , as a result neutrons produced through this mechanism typically have kinetic energies exceeding @xmath4 .    in hadronic air showers the majority of neutrons",
    "are produced in the sub - gev region through head - on collisions of cosmic rays with atmospheric nucleons . during the collision , a nucleon within the atmospheric nucleus gains momentum and forms an intranuclear cascade @xcite . in this cascade different particles",
    "are created , the energy of which , due to the pauli exclusion principle , must exceed the highest occupied energy level in the nucleus . as a result , the intranuclear cascade results in neutrons with energies ranging from 10 s to 100 s of mev . due to the high energies involved ,",
    "the majority of the momenta of the produced neutrons are directed towards the earth s surface .",
    "the intranuclear cascade is followed by the emission of particles from the excited remnant nucleus . in this process , often referred to as evaporation , the nucleus moves to its ground state energy by emitting hadrons and photons .",
    "the emission of hadrons , including neutrons , continues until the excitation level drops below 10 s to 100 s of kev , after which the remaining energy is lost through photon emission @xcite .",
    "the neutrons produced through evaporation have typical energies around @xmath5 .",
    "the emission from the nucleus proceeds isotropically within the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "the resulting neutron emission is therefore expected to be more isotropic than those coming from the two previously described processes .",
    "after production , neutrons lose energy by scattering off atmospheric nuclei . the energy loss and cross section increase with the decreasing mass of the atmospheric nucleus the neutron interacts with .",
    "the process of energy loss , referred to as thermalisation , continues until the energy of the neutron is equal to that of the average energy of the atmospheric nuclei surrounding it .",
    "the momentum vector changes at each scattering interaction . as a result ,",
    "the direction of the neutrons becomes more isotropic during thermalisation .",
    "the density gradient of the atmosphere furthermore has an influence on the momentum vector after many scatterings . as a result of this gradient the majority of the scattered neutrons",
    "are expected to move upwards in the upper stratosphere .     and a magnetic latitude of @xmath6 .",
    "the data points were taken from @xcite.,width=480 ]    a typical differential neutron energy spectrum multiplied by the neutron energy , as measured at an altitude of @xmath7 and a magnetic latitude of @xmath6 , is shown in figure [ typical ] . by multiplying the spectrum with the energy , the evaporation and intranuclear cascade production energy regions become clearly visible at the respective energies of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    the amplitude of the spectrum is not only expected to vary with altitude , but also with magnetic latitude and solar activity .",
    "the earth s magnetic field shields the equator from all charged cosmic rays with a rigidity below @xmath015 gv , whereas in polar regions the cut - off is below 1 gv . as a result , the neutron flux is highest at the magnetic poles .",
    "the solar magnetic field , frozen in the solar wind , further shields the earth from cosmic rays .",
    "this effect can be expressed using the force - field approximation @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the local interstellar spectrum ( lis ) by solar activity is approximated by a potential term @xmath10 .",
    "typical values of @xmath10 , for solar maximum and solar minimum periods , are respectively @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the exact value of @xmath10 depends on the model used for the lis @xcite . for the work presented here ,",
    "the proton lis from @xcite was used .",
    "furthermore both the solar activity and the earth s magnetic field have the largest effect on the lowest energy charged cosmic rays .",
    "the dependencies from these two magnetic fields are therefore coupled , meaning that the effects from solar activity are most pronounced at the magnetic poles . due to the relatively small dependency of the proton - air cross section on energy ( for protons with energies exceeding @xmath4 ) the shape of the differential neutron energy spectrum does not vary significantly with magnetic latitude and solar activity .",
    "the spectral shape in the sub - gev region can therefore be assumed to only vary with altitude .",
    "this can be seen in , for example , @xcite where measured spectra are presented for different magnetic latitudes and nearly identical altitudes .",
    "in order to simulate the atmospheric neutron environment the planetocosmics simulation package @xcite , which incorporated geant4.9.5.p02 @xcite for particle interactions , was used .",
    "the qgsp_bic_hp @xcite physics list , which uses the binary cascade model to handle protons and neutrons with energies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the g4ndl4.0 data set @xcite , to handle scattering interactions of neutrons with energies below @xmath13 , was used .",
    "neutron capture reactions and neutron decay are furthermore taken into account in the simulations .",
    "the simulations presented here made use of a spherical model of the earth ( consisting of @xmath15 ) with a radius of @xmath16 .",
    "the atmosphere was described using the nrlmsise00 model @xcite for @xmath17 latitude and longitude and was set to extend up to @xmath18 .",
    "the earth s magnetic field was described using the igrf model , for the reference date of january 1st 2000 @xcite , for the internal field and the tsy2001 model @xcite for both the outer magnetic field and the magnetopause .",
    "the incoming charged cosmic ray flux comprised only protons and helium nuclei .",
    "the fraction consisting of heavier ions , responsible for @xmath19 of the charged cosmic rays , was accounted for by scaling up the proton and alpha spectra .",
    "this can potentially lead to an underestimation of the neutron flux .    cosmic ray protons and alpha particles",
    "were generated isotropically from a geocentric spherical shell with a radius of @xmath20 .",

    "solar modulation effects on the incoming cosmic ray spectra were taken into account by dividing the incoming proton and alpha spectra into separate energy ranges .",
    "the incoming cosmic ray spectrum was split up into energy ranges : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . within",
    "these ranges the energy of the incoming cosmic rays was taken to be mono - energetic using the mean energy of the range .",
    "the last energy range , between @xmath44 , was simulated as as a power law with index @xmath45 .",
    "simulations were performed for these individual energy ranges and the resulting spectra were summed using normalisation factors based on cosmic ray spectra , as measured at the top of the atmosphere during different solar activities . using this method the same simulation data could be used to recreate the neutron environment during different solar activities .",
    "the spectra measured by the pamela experiment during december 2009 @xcite were used to simulate the neutron environment for a solar minimum ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the neutron environment during a period with high solar activity ( @xmath47 ) was simulated using the proton and helium spectra measured by bess during summer 2002 @xcite .",
    "an example of a typical neutron energy spectrum , resulting from the simulations , is shown in figure [ 60_64 ] .",
    "below @xmath48 the spectrum is relatively hard and dominated by thermalised neutrons and low energy neutrons produced in the evaporation process . above the mean production energy for the evaporation process , @xmath49",
    ", the flux can be seen to decrease more rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "a second kink in the spectrum can be seen around @xmath50 at the start of the region where the intranuclear cascade becomes the dominant production process . from this point , at @xmath50 , to the mean production of the intranuclear cascade , found at @xmath51 , the slope is less steep . above @xmath52",
    "the neutron flux can be seen to drop off sharply as only charge exchange remains as a production process .",
    "based on this shape of the spectrum the simulated neutron differential energy spectra were fitted with 4 power laws of the form @xmath53 , where the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 will be respectively referred to as the normalisation and slope from here on .",

    "was found to depend both on altitude and on the used evaporation model , defined the lower energy limit .",
    "the upper limit of 1 gev was chosen because of low statistics above this energy and a significant dependency of the spectral shape on magnetic latitude for energies exceeding @xmath4 .",
    "these fits were performed to all the spectra resulting from the simulations for altitudes above @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this lower altitude limit is based on limited statistics and the effect of the earth s surface composition on the neutron flux at low altitudes .",

    "the pressure where the exponential decay starts , which coincides with the altitude where the maximum flux is found , is dictated by the parameter @xmath82 .",
