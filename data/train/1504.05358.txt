    "with the mobile data traffic explosion , the small cell network has come to the fore to offload over - utilized macro cell traffic .",
    "however , a small cell base station ( bs ) frequently serves a limited number of users due to its small coverage area @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , the mobility of users even make the time spent in small cell area relatively short .",
    "this results in under - utilization of small cell resources @xcite , motivating us to balance traffic between macro and small cells .    as a remedy for this ,",
    "we suggest to enable small cell bss to charge mobile devices wirelessly , given strong desire of mobile users to charge their devices @xcite . seeking for charging depleted batteries",
    "even makes users move to a nearby place providing power outlets @xcite .",
    "therefore , a wireless power transfer ( wpt ) in small cell bss can act as an incentive to yield the spatial attraction ( sa ) of users in macro cells toward the vicinity of small cell bss . throughout this paper",
    ", we call this network a spatial attraction cellular network ( san ) and its attraction amount is determined by the charging power .    the physical displacement from macro to small cells can be utilized for the improvement in macro - to - small cell",
    "_ load balancing_. from the small cell users perspective who were already in the small cell coverage ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , this attraction also leads to the improvement in _",
    "spectral efficiency_. this is because the attraction toward their associated bss not only increases their received powers of the desired signals but also coincidentally decreases interference .    in an san , these load balanging and spectral efficiency improvements vary with charging power , but their corresponding behaviors are non - trivial . from the load balanging perspective , increasing charging power for instance may incur too much associations at small cell bss .",
    "to mitigate such an issue , it requires an optimal charging power that balances the associations between macro and small cell bss . from the spectral efficiency perspective , on the contrary , high charging power increases the sa users distances from the associated small cell bss , at which the charged powers are still satisfactory in that distance ( compare ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 ) . as a result , increasing charging power decreases spectral efficiency improvement . in this paper",
    "we thus provide the san rate maximizing charging power that jointly optimize the load balanging and spectral efficiency improvements",
    ".    -10pt    * feasibility of san *  san implementation hinges on whether sa is viable in practice .",
    "although mobile device proliferation is relentless , improving battery capacity has still been a major technical bottleneck @xcite .",
    "it makes users more prone to be in danger of battery depletion , leading to a strong battery charging motivation in reality @xcite .",
    "such a motivation results in sa toward charging places , for example , when determining where to go for coffee @xcite or even when charging is the sole reason for movements @xcite .",
    "another key enabler is to implement wpt capable small cells . by means of the advanced signal processing technologies such as an adaptive beamforming",
    ", microwave wpt has a potential to provide battery charging for most of small cell coverages while guaranteeing user safety @xcite .",
    "when utilizing a beamforming antenna having an aperture of @xmath0 m in radius , for instance , it theoretically yields charging at the distance of @xmath1 meters with the charging amount of @xmath2 watt when the transmit power is @xmath3 watt @xcite .    * related works *  wpt aided cellular networks have recently attracted attention , accompanied by rapid advancement in wpt technologies @xcite .",
    "its advantage in network capacity perspective has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the network capacity enhancement comes from allowing more communicating users in that wpt mitigates battery depletion . along with such improvement",
    ", we also capture the network capacity increment via increasing spectral efficiency owing to sa .",
    "the sa also provides improvement via macro - to - small cell load balancing without degrading spectral efficiency .",
    "it is unlike preceding schemes such as cell range expansion ( cre ) @xcite that balance the load in return for the spectral efficiency decrement . in detail ,",
    "offloaded users in cre are associated with small bss who give lower signal power than the originally associated macro bss . than the originally associated bss turn into dominant interferers ,",
    "whose powers are even higher than the recived signal powers , leading to the decrement in spectral efficiency .    * contributions *  this study examines the ramifications of wpt in downlink small cells in terms of maximizing rate - coverage , the proability of a typical user achieving data rate greater than a threshold .",
    "the main contributions are listed below .    *",
    "we propose an san that spatially attracts users to small cell bss by the aid of battery charging wpt and thereby elevates the rate coverage of the network .",
    "we use a stochastic geometric approach to derive its rate coverage and demonstrate that significant improvements are feasible only with short sa distance , e.g. 125 % rate coverage when maximum sa distance is only @xmath4 m ( see propositions 1 and 2 as well as fig . 3 in section iii ) .",
    "* an optimal charging power is derived in a closed form in an asymptotic case where user density is much higher than that of bss such as an urban area , providing a design guideline of san ( see corollary 1 in section iii ) . * to analyze san rate coverate , we consider data usage pattern dependent on user s residual energy .",
