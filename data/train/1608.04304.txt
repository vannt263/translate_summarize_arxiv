    "a familiar theme in statistical mechanics is that particles interacting by simple dynamical rules can lead to complex emergent behaviour  familiar examples include the rich phenomenology of fluid dynamics and turbulence which appear generically when atoms or molecules interact by momentum - conserving collisions , or the wide range of thermodynamic phases that are available for spherical ( isotropically - interacting ) particles . even in much simpler model systems such as exclusion processes or zero - range processes in one dimension",
    ", unexpected phenomena continue to surprise physicists and mathematicians , including condensation  @xcite and unusual fluctuation phenomena  @xcite .    here , we investigate a very simple model with unusual condensation behavior .",
    "we consider @xmath0 particles that diffuse in a one - dimensional periodic system of size @xmath1 .",
    "the particles are coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 and interact via attractive forces from their nearest neighbours , which leads to the formation of clusters of particles .",
    "we focus on a _ hydrodynamic limit _ of large system size @xmath1 , in which the particle density @xmath3 is fixed , but the interaction strength increases in the limit .",
    "we find that the particles self - organise into a large number of clusters .",
    "the number of particles in each cluster diverges in the limit ; at the same time , each cluster becomes concentrated on a single point .",
    "the relation to condensation is that the large gaps between clusters correspond to the kinds of condensate that appear in mass transport models  @xcite , following a mapping described in  @xcite .",
    "the unusual feature of the model considered here is that the system forms many large clusters or , equivalently , many condensates .",
    "systems with multiple condensates have been investigated before  @xcite , but this effect is much less studied than systems with a single condensate , and the mechanism of condensation in our case differs from  @xcite .",
    "there are also similarities between this work and the traffic flow model of  @xcite , where each cluster considered here would correspond to a traffic jam .",
    "however , the system considered here is at equilibrium , so the clusters have diffusive ( not ballistic ) motion .",
    "as well as offering a new twist on condensation , this work is also motivated by connections between this model system and a recent mathematical study  @xcite where it was found that the dynamics of the particle density in a similar model should be described by a stochastic partial differential equation ( pde ) with a stochastic term that does not vanish in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "usually , one expects to recover ( almost surely ) deterministic behaviour in the hydrodynamic limit : for example , the deterministic diffusion equation describes the spreading of the density of a large number of random walkers .",
    "moreoever , the stochastic pde found in  @xcite is closely related to the dean equation  @xcite , which describes ( in this case ) the diffusive motion of a finite number of non - interacting particles .",
    "this result offers the possibility that the clusters that form in our model might themselves act as free particles that diffuse through the system .",
    "however , the arguments of  @xcite do not provide a simple physical picture of the behaviour of the underlying particle model . by exploring its behaviour in more detail",
    ", we find that the emergence of clusters is consistent with the existence of a finite stochastic element to the dynamics even in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "however , these clusters do not diffuse as free particles , but are instead rather strongly interacting , leading to a scale - invariant distribution of clusters within the system .",
    "we argue that an understanding of the hydrodynamic limit of this model requires an understanding of the dynamics of the clusters that form in the system  this work establishes a foundation for future work in that area .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : static ] we derive some basic results for its static ( equilibrium ) properties , including the existence of an instability towards cluster formation at a finite temperature @xmath4 , and its behaviour in the thermodynamic limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] , we consider the limit in which multiple macroscopic clusters appear and we analyse the ( non - trvial ) structure of this state . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications of these results and their connection to previous work .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 particles that move in a one dimensional system of size @xmath1 , with periodic boundaries .",
    "the position of particle @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "let the distance between particle @xmath5 and the nearest particle to its right be @xmath7 .",
    "each particle interacts only with its nearest left and right neighbours so the energy of the system can be written in the form @xmath8 where we introduced the vector @xmath9 , from which the gap sizes @xmath10 can be calculated .",
    "we focus on the specific case @xmath11 with @xmath12 , so that particles feel attractive forces from their neighbours . in this case",
    ", the energy can take arbitrarily large negative values when one or more gaps are very small . to avoid theoretical difficulties associated with this effect ,",
    "it is sometimes convenient to regularise the energy , for which we consider two possibilities : we can either take @xmath13 for some small constant @xmath14 , or we give each particle a hard core of size @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the behaviour as @xmath17 : we believe that all the results that we present here are valid in that limit .",
    "we consider this system to be coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 so that , given sufficiently long time , we expect the system to equilibrate . in that case , the probability ( or probability density ) of finding the system in configuration @xmath18 is given by a boltzmann distribution , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a normalisation constant ( partition function ) .",
    "this formula assumes that the distribution is normalisable , which is certainly true for any @xmath21 but may fail for @xmath22 : we return to this question below .",
    "we consider two dynamical rules for the evolution of the model in time . in the first ,",
    "the particles evolve according to a langevin equation as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a friction constant ( which acts only to set the units of time ) , @xmath25 is a gaussian distributed white noise with zero mean and @xmath26 .",
    "this choice is simple from a theoretical point of view and is consistent with  @xcite , but the model is difficult from a numerical perspective because of the large values of @xmath27 that appear when particles approach one another . in the absence of any interparticle forces ( @xmath28 ) , the single particle diffusion constant is @xmath29",
    ".    the second choice , which is more convenient numerically , uses a monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics to evolve the system according to a markov chain .",
    "the method depends on a parameter @xmath30 , which is the maximum displacement of a single particle in a single mc move . in each",
    "mc move , a particle @xmath5 is chosen at random , and a displacement @xmath31 is chosen uniformly from @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the particle is moved from @xmath33 to @xmath34 and the change in energy associated with this move is calculated .",
    "this move is accepted with a probability given by the metropolis formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the change in energy associated with the move .",
    "if the move is not accepted then the particle is returned to its original position @xmath33 .",
    "after each attempted move , the time is incremented by @xmath37 so that in the absence of interparticle forces , the diffusion constant for the mc dynamics matches that of the langevin equation ( [ equ : lang ] ) .",

    "particles are initially distributed at random in the system but as time progresses , clusters of particles are observed to form.,width=302 ]    note that within the mc method , the ordering of the particles within the system may change , since particles are free to `` overtake '' each other .",
    "also , the system respects detailed balance with respect to the equilibrium distribution ( [ equ : y2 ] ) so , for large times , the system should converge to that distribution .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath41 ( assuming now that @xmath21 ) , this dynamical mc method converges to the solution of the langevin equation ( [ equ : lang ] ) .",
    "however , we note that the results presented here are far from the limit @xmath41 , in particular , this limit may require @xmath42 while our numerical results have @xmath43 .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasise that the steady state distribution of the system is given by ( [ equ : boltz ] ) , independent of @xmath30 ( as long as the distribution ( [ equ : boltz ] ) is normalisable ) .",

    "are distributed at random , but one clearly sees that they self - organise into clusters .",
    "of course this result is expected since particles can reduce their energy by approaching each other .",
    "the questions that we address in the following relate to this cluster formation .",
    "in order to investigate cluster formation , it is useful to consider the distribution ( probability density ) for the gap sizes @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the model with @xmath22 , in which case ( [ equ : boltz ] ) leads to @xmath45 where @xmath46 ; also @xmath47 is the ( dimensionless ) inverse temperature , the function @xmath48 is a dirac delta , and @xmath49 is the partition function for this representation of the system .",
    "distributions of this form are familiar from zero - range processes and from mass transport models  @xcite .",
    "one sees from ( [ equ : y2 ] ) that this probability density diverges as @xmath50 , and that the distribution will not be normalisable for @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) is a special temperature for this model , as we now discuss .",

    "the resulting integral is independent of @xmath62 so ( at least for @xmath63 ) it can be absorbed into the normalisation constant , yielding @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a normalisation constant . hence the rescaled gap length @xmath66 follows a beta distribution",
    ". it will be useful in the following to recall the definitions of three special functions @xmath67 which are the gamma function ( @xmath68 ) , the digamma function ( @xmath69 ) and the beta function ( @xmath70 ) . using these results ,",
    "normalisation of @xmath71 means that for @xmath63 ( high temperature ) we have @xmath72 .    for @xmath73 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath71 is not normalisable , due to divergence at small @xmath74 . in this regime ,",
    "the regularisation parameter @xmath14 is essential : including it cuts off the divergence , but the result is that the distribution becomes dominated by very small gaps with sizes of order @xmath14 . on the other hand , for @xmath75",
    "( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , as @xmath17 , the likelihood of observing such a small gap tends to zero , so the regularisation has no significant effect : this is the regime on which we focus here .",
    "we also calculate the mean energy per particle which ( in units of @xmath76 ) is @xmath77 , where the angle brackets denote averages in the equilibrium state of the system .",
    "writing @xmath78 and using properties of the beta function yields the energy per particle @xmath79 as @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 , so the energy becomes large and negative in this limit , again signalling that the system is unstable and small gaps are predominating .    finally , it is useful to consider the average fraction of the system that is taken up by gaps with sizes between @xmath74 and @xmath82 , which is @xmath83 , with @xmath84 compared with @xmath71 , the main feature of this distribution is that while there may be very many gaps with small @xmath74 , these take up only a small fraction of the system . for @xmath85 ,",
    "this means that @xmath86 tends to zero as @xmath87 , in contrast to @xmath71 which diverges .",
    "if one picks a random point in the system then the size of the gap containing this point is distributed as @xmath88 , and the mean of this distribution is easily verified to be @xmath89 ( note that @xmath90 independent of the arrangement of the particles , so one always has @xmath91 , but the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are sensitive to the structure of the system . in the following we sometimes refer to @xmath93 as",

    "( b )  time evolution of the mean gap size @xmath93 , with equilbrium values shown as solid horizontal lines .",
    "( c )  time evolution of the average energy per gap @xmath98 .",
    "this quantity is sensitive to the gap size distribution at small @xmath74  for the lower temperature , this quantity has not fully converged even for the largest times considered , since the mc dynamics used are not efficient for sampling very small gaps.,width=566 ]    figure  [ fig : finiten ] shows results obtained with the mc dynamics , and compared with the theoretical predictions of this section . for these calculations we work at unit density @xmath99 with @xmath40 ( fixing",
    "the density simply fixes the unit of length since the interaction potential @xmath100 has no characteristic length scale ) . within the numerical calculations , we regularise using a very small value of @xmath14 , of the order of the machine precision : the results do not depend on the precise value of @xmath14 and they agree with the predictions for the limit @xmath17 .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that the limit @xmath17 is regular for the dynamics as well as for the equilibrium properties , as long as @xmath63 ( that is , @xmath75 ) .",
    "the gap size distribution @xmath86 agrees well with the theoretical predictions . for this distribution ,",
    "the most apparent effect of the attractive forces between particles is to enhance the probability of _ large gaps _ ",
    "this is due to the formation of clusters of particles , with large gaps between them .",
    "starting from a random initial condition , fig .",
    "[ fig : finiten ] also shows the convergence to equilibrium of the mean gap size @xmath93 and the mean energy per particle , as a function of time .",
    "the agreement of the equilibrium values with theory is again good although we note that convergence to equilibrium can be slow for large systems and lower temperatures , particularly for the mean energy .",
    "the reason is that when particles are close to each other , their energies are low and mc moves that increase the energy are unlikely to be accepted  also , the probability of proposing a move into a state where the particles are extremely close is small , so these states are rather hard to access .",
    "this effect is particularly apparent for the mean energy since that quantity is dominated by the smallest gaps in the system , in contrast to the mean gap @xmath93 , which is dominated by large gaps .",
    "convergence to equilibrium could presumably be improved by using different mc moves ( either with smaller @xmath30 , or a non - trivial distribution of mc move sizes , or mc moves that move clusters of particles collectively  @xcite ) .",
    "so far we considered results for systems with finite numbers of particles . here",
    ", we briefly discuss the thermodynamic limit in which the temperature @xmath2 is fixed , and @xmath103 with fixed @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to consider the distribution of a single gap which from ( [ equ : p1y - finite ] ) can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a normalisation constant . using the standard result @xmath106 with @xmath63 and @xmath107",
    "we obtain a gamma distribution : @xmath108 with @xmath109^{1-\\beta}$ ] . for @xmath110 ( non - interacting particles )",
    ", we recover a simple exponential distribution with mean @xmath111 , as expected . for @xmath112",
    ", small gaps are favoured due to the factor @xmath113 . at the same time",
    "the interaction also enhances the statistical weight of _ large _ gaps , via the decaying exponential term in ( [ equ : p1inf ] )  this ensures that the mean gap size remains constant at @xmath111 , as required .",
    "we also have @xmath114 from which we see ( as expected ) that a randomly chosen point in the system is almost surely contained in a gap of size of order @xmath115 , which remains constant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also the mean energy per site ( [ equ : enn ] ) converges to @xmath116 where we used @xmath117 as @xmath118 .",
    "we have explained that @xmath52 corresponds to a special temperature for the model , in that the boltzmann distribution is not normalised at lower temperatures ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "it is useful to consider briefly the limit @xmath120 , in a finite system . from ( [ equ : yg ] ) , one sees that on choosing a random point , the mean size of the gap containing that point is @xmath121 as @xmath120 .",
    "since all gaps must be smaller than @xmath1 , this means that as @xmath120 the whole of the system becomes dominated by a single gap , with all the particles located in a single cluster ( and separated by much smaller gaps ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath122+o(1-\\beta)^2 $ ] , from which one sees that the @xmath123 small gaps have an average size of roughly @xmath124 as the limit is approached .",
    "this situation , where a single gap occupies almost all of the system , corresponds to a particular kind of condensation phenomenon , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we also note that a similar singularity appears in the trap model of glassy dynamics proposed by bouchaud  @xcite , for which the partition function is not normalisable for low temperatures : in that case there is an associated stochastic dynamics that is well defined for all @xmath2 but the system that never equilibrates for @xmath125 , leading to aging behaviour . in section  [ sec : multi ] below , we investigate the behaviour of our model for @xmath126 .",
    "however , before embarking on that analysis , we connect the results obtained thus far to previous work on condensation processes .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , particle hopping models of the type considered here are related to mass transport models . to see this",
    ", we use the regularisation in which particles can not approach each other more closely then @xmath14 , and consider the mc time evolution given above with @xmath127 . in this case particles",
    "may not overtake each other , so we can order their positions so that @xmath128 ( modulo periodic boundaries )",

    "the original model corresponds to a dynamical evolution for the masses @xmath7 : if particle @xmath5 in the original model moves to the right by a distance @xmath130 , this corresponds to a transfer of mass @xmath130 in the lattice model , from site @xmath131 to site @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the rate for such events depends on the mass transfer @xmath130 and on the orignal masses @xmath132 .",
    "this corresponds to a particular chipping kernel for the mass transport  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of _ condensation _ in this mass transport model happens in the thermodynamic limit @xmath133 at fixed @xmath134 : condensation means that a finite fraction of the total mass becomes concentrated on a single site @xmath5 .",
    "in the particle model , this corresponds a situation where one of the gaps between particles takes up a finite fraction of the system .",
    "a large body of previous work  @xcite has considered distributions of the form ( [ equ : y2 ] ) , but with some regularisation at small @xmath7 so that the power law @xmath113 might be replaced ( for example ) by @xmath135 . in this case",
    ", condensation is generally expected for @xmath136  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit of the particle model",
    ", this means that a single large gap would occupies a finite fraction of the system , with other gaps having typical sizes of order @xmath115 .",
    "we note that this _ condensation _ is not generally the same as cluster formation in the model considered here .",
    "condensation corresponds to a single large gap taking up a finite fraction of the system  it is a feature associated with a very large gap . here",
    ", cluster formation will be associated with a large number of particles concentrating at a single point ",
    "it is associated with many very small gaps .",
    "a corollary of these small gaps is that some larger gaps must also form ( since the mean gap size is fixed ) . in the model considered here ,",
    "these large gaps take up a finite fraction of the system , as in condensation , but cluster formation need not be linked to this effect .",
    "moreover , the origin of the condensation behaviour considered here is different from the classical case  @xcite , due the singular behaviour of ( [ equ : y2 ] ) for small @xmath7 . as a result ,",
    "the clustering instability considered here is already present for @xmath119 ( but only if the regularisation parameter @xmath17 ) , while the condensation instability sets in only for @xmath136 ( and occurs even if @xmath21 ) .",
    "the instability considered here also has a condensate that contains _ all _ of the mass in the system , reminiscent of inclusion processes  @xcite .",

    ", we consider a kind of hydrodynamic limit . to motivate this ,",
    "fix the density @xmath3 and increase the system size @xmath1 , but imagine observing the system on a length scale @xmath137 that is also increasing .",
    "the usual expectation is that as we observe the system on these large scales , a description in terms of individual particles can be replaced by a description in terms of a smooth density profile , as happens ( for example ) when the motion of a fluid is described by the navier - stokes equation .",
    "mathematically , the limit of large observation scale @xmath138 can be investigated by rescaling particle positions from @xmath139 into the unit interval @xmath140 , defining @xmath141 , and observing this rescaled system on a length scale @xmath142 . taking this limit at a fixed density , the _",
    "mean _ spacing between particles in the rescaled system is @xmath143 , which tends to zero  @xcite .",
    "assuming that _ all _ particle spacings tend to zero in this way , the system can be defined in terms of a smooth density profile : in an observation window of size @xmath144 one expects of order @xmath145 particles , which diverges in the hydrodynamic limit . in this case , one expects a law of large numbers to apply , so that even if the particle positions are random , the fraction of particles in any such region will converge ( almost surely ) to a deterministic value of order unity .    to make this argument precise , define the empirical density @xmath146 where we recall that the @xmath147 are the positions of the particles , rescaled into the unit interval .",
    "since the empirical density is a sum of dirac delta functions , we clearly can not expect pointwise convergence to any smooth density profile .",
    "instead , we consider a weaker form of convergence : the empirical density @xmath148 converges to a smooth density profile @xmath149 if for any sufficiently well - behaved test function @xmath150 , one has ( almost surely ) that @xmath151 .",
    "for example , in the model considered here at equilibrium for @xmath63 , the statement is true for with @xmath152 , independent of @xmath153 .",
    "a more interesting setting for the same question would be : if the system is prepared away from equilibrium with a density profile @xmath149 that is not constant , how does this smooth density evolve with time ? for @xmath63 , we expect some kind of ( deterministic ) diffusion equation , perhaps with a density - dependent diffusion constant .",
    "however , in this section , we concentrate on a different situation  @xcite , in which the empirical measure does not converge to any kind of smooth profile , even as @xmath154 .      to achieve this , we modify ( increase ) the interaction strength as we increase the number of particles , by taking @xmath155 for some constant @xmath156 , so that @xmath157 .",
    "we have @xmath80 as @xmath154 , and since @xmath52 is the limit of stability of the model , one may expect to see non - trivial behaviour in this limit .",
    "a similar construction was used to define interacting particle systems with multiple condensates  @xcite , and in models with discontinuous condensation  @xcite .",
    "now consider an equilibrium configuration of the model , and a random point within the system .",

    "the key point is that this limiting probability density exists for all @xmath162 , is independent of @xmath1 , and is normalised to unity .",
    "recall that @xmath158 is the size of a gap between two particles , scaled by the system size .",
    "hence ( [ equ : phat - y ] ) means that a randomly chosen point in an equilibrium configuration lies ( almost surely ) in a gap whose size is comparable with the system size .",
    "this is not at all the case in the conventional thermodynamic limit , in which almost all gaps are comparable with the inverse density @xmath163 . in that case",
    "all of the scaled gaps @xmath164 tend almost surely to zero as we take @xmath154 , so the limiting probability density @xmath165 would be concentrated entirely at @xmath166 .",

    "( a ) increasing @xmath0 at constant @xmath190 : as the number of particles increases then the local density is self - averaging and @xmath191 converges to a flat profile , as expected for a diffusive system at equilibrium .",
    "( that is , the density satisfies a law of large numbers within each bin . )",
    "( b ) increasing @xmath0 and varying @xmath192 according to ( [ equ : beta - scaling ] ) with @xmath173 does not lead to a smooth density profile : multiple clusters of particles persist even as @xmath154 because the particle correlations are so strong there is no law of large numbers within each bin .",
    "( for @xmath193 and @xmath173 , the limitations of our numerical method mean that the system may not be completely converged to equilibrium , but the data are sufficient illustrate the qualitative behaviour.),width=566 ]    the resulting situation is illustrated numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] , where we represent the density @xmath148 by histograms , for various different configurations .",
    "taking @xmath154 at fixed @xmath190 , the results are consistent with convergence to a smooth profile : there are sufficiently many particles in each region of space that a law of large numbers applies so the local ( smoothed ) density @xmath194 as @xmath154 .",
    "however , if we fix @xmath178 in ( [ equ : beta - scaling ] ) and take the limit @xmath154 , the results indicate that there is no convergence to a smooth density profile .",
    "the emergence of several ( or many ) clusters in this model raises several interesting questions . in the remainder of this work ,",
    "we investigate how many of these clusters there are and how they are distributed in space .",
    "other possible questions , such as the dynamics of these clusters  @xcite , are beyond the scope of this work , but we discuss them briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "from ( [ equ : phat - y ] ) , one sees that on choosing a random point in the system , the average size of the gap containing this point is @xmath195 . from this result",
    ", one might suppose that there are typically @xmath178 clusters within the system , separated by gaps of this typical size .",
    "in fact the situation is rather more complicated .    to see this ,",
    "suppose that we choose two random points in the system .",
    "for a finite system with @xmath0 particles and interaction parameter @xmath192 , we have a joint probability density for the two gap sizes @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the distribution ( [ equ : pg ] ) for a system of size @xmath1 containing @xmath0 particles .",
    "the first term in ( [ equ : p2yyp ] ) accounts for the case where both points are in the same gap , while the second is the case where they are in different gaps .",
    "( if the first point to be chosen is in a gap of size @xmath198 , the probabilities of these two outcomes are @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively . ) in the case where the two points are in different gaps , we have used the fact that gaps are independent , so once the first gap is fixed , the distribution of the second gap is obtained by considering an equivalent system with size @xmath201 , and with one fewer particle .",
    "if we now take the hydrodynamic limit according to ( [ equ : beta - scaling ] ) , we define @xmath202 and obtain @xmath203 where the step function @xmath204 in the second term enforces that the sum of the two gaps must be less than the system size . note that this distribution is symmetric in @xmath205 ( as it should be ) .    from the second term in ( [ equ : p2yyp - inf ] )",
    "we see when the two points are located in different gaps , then _",
    "both _ of these gaps almost surely have sizes comparable with the whole system .",
    "if we condition on this case , we can consider the distribution of second gap @xmath206 , given a particular value of the first gap @xmath158 . rescaling the size of the second gap as @xmath207 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath208 is exactly the original @xmath209 .",
    "( this fact is true only in the hydrodynamic limit @xmath154 because it relies on the fact that replacing @xmath123 by @xmath0 in the last term of ( [ equ : p2yyp ] ) has no effect on the limiting behaviour . )",
    "analysing the joint distribution of three or more gaps is a straightforward extension of the same procedure .",
    "the conclusion is that if we remove a single large gap from the system , the distribution of the remaining large gaps in the remainder of the system is the same ( up to rescaling ) as the distribution of all the gaps within the whole system .",
    "hence we conclude that there are in fact infinitely many large gaps , and hence _ infinitely many _ clusters in the system , arranged in a hierarchical structure .",
    "each cluster should concentrate on a single point .",
    "the origin @xmath210 has been placed at the centre of a cluster and the periodic image of this cluster is shown at @xmath211 by an unfilled triangle .",
    "( b ) if we ignore the last gap ( which has size @xmath212 ) and zoom in on the remainder of the system , the distribution of clusters within this subsystem is statistically identical ( as @xmath154 ) to their distribution in the full system.,width=377 ]    a sketch of this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clust - sketch ] , illustrating how the system includes gaps of all sizes , arranged in a fractal ( self - similar ) structure .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasise that since the number of particles in the system has already been taken to infinity , typical gaps between particles are vanishingly small on the scale shown here .",
    "so while the number of the clusters in the system is infinite , each cluster contains a very large ( presumably infinite ) number of particles .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath213 , this hierarchical structure simplifies : the distribution @xmath209 concentrates at @xmath214 so the system is dominated by a single large gap ( with all the particles concentrated in a single large cluster ) .",
    "this recovers the case that was discussed informally in sec .",
    "[ sec : beta1 ] .",
    "we have defined a model of interacting particles on the real line , which has an instability at temperature @xmath215 .",
    "below this temperature , particles attract each other so strongly that the gaps between adjacent particles tend to zero , and the system is unstable to collapse at a single point .",
    "however , the system is well - behaved for @xmath216 : particles attract each other and assemble into clusters .",
    "all clusters are finite in the thermodynamic limit , and the system has a hydrodynamic limit in which the macroscopic density is smooth .",
    "we have shown that if we take a hydrodynamic limit in which @xmath217 from above as the number of particles tends to infinity , this system has a well - defined equilibrium state in which density profiles are not at all smooth : instead particle self - organise into clusters that are arranged in a self - similar hierarchical structure .    the limiting process that we took in order to arrive at this situation was somewhat unusual , but similar methods have been used in zero - range processes  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of this model further accentuates the rich phenomenology that is accessible even in deceptively simple interacting particle systems .",
    "it also raises several interesting new questions .",
    "our model was inspired by  @xcite , in which a similar model was proposed , with the same invariant measure ( compare the first equation in section 2 of that paper with our eq .",
    "[ equ : y2 ] , and note that @xmath192 in that work corresponds to our @xmath218 , up to corrections of order @xmath219 ) .",
    "the results of that work indicate that this model has an underlying ( abstract ) geometrical structure related to the wasserstein metric  this is a metric in the space of density profiles @xmath148 , with connections to diffusive processes : see  @xcite for a physical discussion and  @xcite for a more mathematical presentation . from the results presented here ,",
    "the precise connection between this geometrical structure and our model is not clear to us : we expect that the motion of the clusters that form in the system should be described by a stochastic process in this abstract space , but this requires further investigation .",
    "independent of those questions , it would also be very interesting to characterise the motion of the clusters of particles that form in this system , when the hydrodynamic limit is taken .",
    "in particular , we expect the clusters to move diffusively  @xcite , and they should presumably undergo fusion and fission processes when they encounter one another . certainly , the langevin dynamics ( [ equ : lang ] ) imply that the centre of mass of a cluster of mass @xmath0 moves with a diffusion constant of order @xmath219 , but other processes in the system may also be relevant ( for example exchange of particles between clusters , which can even lead to cluster evaporation ) . also , the mc dynamics defined here are different in general from ( [ equ : lang ] ) , given that we take @xmath154 and @xmath220 at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "further numerical or analytical results for these processes would be valuable , either for this system or for other systems where multiple clusters ( or condensates ) appear in large systems  @xcite .",
    "we hope to revisit these questions in a later work .",
