    "transport properties of devices based on two - dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum hall regime are determined by uncompensated currents that are carried by the edges of the sample.@xcite the edge states have a very large coherence length @xcite and they can be used for construction of electron interferometers.@xcite each of the edges carry the current in a single direction only and the backscattering @xcite at high magnetic field requires electron transfer from one edge to the other across the bulk of the sample .",
    "the interedge tunneling paths can be opened at constrictions ( quantum point contacts qpcs ) which are intentionally introduced to the channel .",
    "a pair of qpcs with an internal cavity @xcite form a setup which is referred to as quantum hall,@xcite electronic fabry - prot @xcite or aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer.@xcite the latter reference is due to the periodicity of conductance ( @xmath0 ) in external magnetic field for the currents following the edges of the cavity .",
    "a similar interference mechanism and periodic @xmath0 behavior is found for an antidot introduced between the edges of the sample@xcite with electron currents encircling the antidot .    at low magnetic field",
    "the electron currents passing through a quantum point contact can be mapped@xcite by the scanning gate microscopy @xcite which measures conductance as functions of the position of the atomic force microscope tip moving above the sample .",
    "the charged tip is capacitively coupled to the electron gas and modifies the local potential landscape .",
    "in particular a clear semi - classical magnetic focusing @xcite of electron currents at a field of a fraction of tesla was observed .",
    "the magnetic fields of the order of mt lift the interference pattern of @xmath0 maps of qpc that appear according to the weak localization mechanism.@xcite at higher magnetic fields , within the quantum hall regime the currents evade a direct mapping bypassing any potential perturbations introduced by the tip .",

    "was demonstrated by the scanning gate microscopy .",
    "simulations of the coherent transport in similar conditions are the purpose of the present work . to the best of our knowledge",
    "we provide the first wave function description of the scanning gate microscopy mapping of the coherent flow across the electron interferometer .",
    "the qhi is modeled as an antidot with a fixed potential .",
    "we discuss formation of current loops around the qhi which is reentrant in function of the magnetic field .",

    "the early experiments @xcite on electron interferometers in the integer quantum hall regime detected the aharonov - bohm periodicity with period @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the flux quantum and @xmath4 is the area encircled by the currents .",
    "subsequent studies @xcite reported fractional periodicity with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of edge modes fully transmitted across the sample .",
    "the fractional periodicity of ab conductance oscillations in electron interferometers are explained as due to the electron - electron interaction.@xcite the interaction effects leading to fractional periodicity are outside the range of mean field description@xcite which reproduces the @xmath2 period .",
    "the present calculation neglects the electron - electron interaction and in consequence the integer periodicity is found for any @xmath6 .",
