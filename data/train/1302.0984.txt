    "they have been found to appear robustly in various applications @xcite and have been investigated by several groups of researchers as a way to model and understand a number of types of collective neural dynamics . in particular , the networks seem to be able to model a diverse range of systems , from ( deterministic or random ) sequence generation via `` winnerless competition '' @xcite and finite - state computation @xcite , to aspects of neural function @xcite and , for example , binocular rivalry @xcite .",

    "more precisely , we consider a ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath4 with smooth @xmath5 that defines a flow on @xmath6 .",
    "we say an closed invariant set @xmath7 is a _ heteroclinic network _ for this flow if it is a union of a finite set of equilibria and connecting orbits between these equilibria , such that the invariant set is chain transitive ( i.e. it is a depth one heteroclinic network in the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "the set @xmath8 is a _ robust heteroclinic network _",
    "if ( subject to specified constraints such as symmetries and smoothness ) there is an open set of perturbations of @xmath9 that have a nearby heteroclinic network that is homeomorphic to the original .",
    "we say a heteroclinic network is a _ heteroclinic attractor _ if it is an attractor in some sense - this could mean , for example , asymptotic stability or milnor attraction . in the presence of additive noise",
    ", we expect trajectories starting close to such a _ noisy heteroclinic attractor _ to remain close to the network for long periods of time .    until now , two of the main barriers to using heteroclinic networks to model specific neural processes are firstly , that coupled systems can possess quite complicated robust heteroclinic networks , and secondly , it can be highly nontrivial to determine whether a given coupled cell system has a heteroclinic network .",
    "even when one can find a heteroclinic network , it may have very high complexity for only a moderate number of coupled cells .",
    "for example , heteroclinic networks with the structure of `` odd graphs '' @xcite can be found in systems of @xmath10 oscillators , and heteroclinic ratchets can be found in less symmetric coupled systems @xcite . up to",
    "now there seems to be no way to easily design a coupled dynamical system that realises a _ given _ directed network as a robust heteroclinic attractor ; the closest approaches we are aware of are @xcite .",
    "the last of these specifically considers the design of heteroclinic networks using small numbers of coupled cells by a process of `` inflation '' of cells in a smaller network but it is not clear how to use this to design an arbitrary heteroclinic network .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to give two explicit methods for design of coupled cell systems that realise a given directed graph as a heteroclinic network . in doing so ,",
    "we suggest possible robust ways to embed a finite - state discrete state computational system into a system of autonomous coupled dynamical systems .",
    "the method in section  [ sec : simplex ] ( which we call the simplex realisation ) realises any graph ( that is one- and two - cycle free ) as a heteroclinic network for a cubic polynomial vector field on a simplex .",
    "the method in section  [ sec : cylinder ] ( which we call the cylinder realisation ) realises any graph that is one - cycle free based around a vector field on a line coupled to a number of `` transition modes '' .",
    "we do this by constructing a `` coupled cell system '' that in both cases is `` all - to - all '' coupled with a small number of cell types , but where the coupling is inhomogeneous .",

    "the dashed lines indicate that the nature of coupling between the @xmath13 is of a different nature to that between that @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",

    "[ sec : stats ] we consider long - term statistics of the behaviour near the network under the influence of noise fluctuations .",
    "we see that the transition behaviour between vertices is in certain cases well - modelled as a markov process with transition depending only on the current vertex .",
    "the presence of `` lift - off '' @xcite of trajectories can lead to short - term memory  i.e .",
    "cases where the transition probability depends not only on the current vertex but also on the past few vertices visited ; we lose the markov property .",
    "this is observed in numerical simulations and discussed in section  [ sec : statsnumerics ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : discuss ] finishes with a discussion of issues around the proposed methods of realization of heteroclinic cycles , and we give general thoughts on how these constructions may be related to applications .",

    "it is well known that a realisation may be robust if the form of @xmath9 is constrained  see for example @xcite .",

    "the coupling structures are sketched in figure  [ fig : schem_design ] .",
    "the first method is a cubic vector field similar to that of @xcite where the vertices of the graph are embedded as vertices of an @xmath2-simplex ( note that an @xmath35-simplex has @xmath36 vertices)we call this the `` simplex realisation '' .",

    ". we will be interested in the long time ( asymptotic ) behaviour of the system in the presence of noise and inhomogeneities , where the heteroclinic network will not be an exact solution but it gives a clear framework in which one can discuss the dynamics of nearby solutions .",
    "the first construction proceeds as follows .",

    "this means we assume that any transients associated with the initial condition will have decayed and that the initial condition is distributed according to a stationary invariant probability distribution on the space of initial conditions @xmath198 for the noise - perturbed system , and the noise path @xmath199 is `` typical '' .",

    "the transition probabilities will be affected ( to a greater or lesser extent ) by the eigenvalues at the equilibria and by the noise level . in the following section , we outline the influence of these parameters .",
    "finally , using the simplex realisation of the decision graph , section  [ sec : statsnumerics ] gives some numerical examples with and without memory .",
    "analysis of the dynamics of trajectories near heteroclinic cycles and networks is often done via construction of poincar maps to approximate the flow ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the return maps are an ensemble of maps where each is a composition of two types of map : local maps past neighbourhoods of the equilibria and global map that connect the neighbourhoods .",
    "the local maps are constructed assuming no resonances and then linearising the flow near the equilibria while the global maps are truncated taylor expansions of the maps near the connecting orbits .",
    "the lowest order truncations of these maps then approximate the flow close to the heteroclinic network .",
    "the detailed construction of such maps for the networks ( even in the noise - free case ) is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , in later sections we apply previous results regarding the dynamics of trajectories near heteroclinic networks in the presence of noise , so we find it useful to define the appropriate poincar sections here .",
    "poincar sections are often defined to be surfaces a distance @xmath231 from an equilibrium , where @xmath231 is some small constant , meaning they are spheres .",
    "however , in order to apply results of stone , armbruster and others  @xcite we define poincar sections as unions of codimension one surfaces as follows .",
    "we give explicit definitions of poincar sections for the simplex realisation ; for the cylinder realisation they can be defined similarly .",

    "the more interesting case is when the equilibrium has two expanding directions , as in the example shown schematically in figure  [ fig : psects ] . here",
    ", at the equilibrium @xmath239 , the trajectory makes a ` choice ' as to whether to next visit @xmath240 or @xmath176 .",
    "we give here an outline of how to compute the probabilities of the trajectory making each choice ; that is , the transition probabilities .",
    "the extension of these calculations to equilibria with three or more expanding directions is straightforward .",
    "armbruster et .",
    "al  @xcite compute the transition probabilities for an equilibrium with two expanding directions , under the assumption that the incoming distribution of coordinates of a trajectory is approximately gaussian and centered at zero .",
    "for the schematic example in figure  [ fig : psects ] , we show this distribution of incoming trajectories , in terms of the @xmath247 and @xmath248 coordinates on @xmath249 , on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : h2 in ] .",
    "the proportion of trajectories which we expect to visit @xmath176 is given by the proportion of the measure in the ` noise ellipse ' which intersects the cusp .",
    "the computation of this area was given in  @xcite .",
    "the results depend on constants which come from the global part of the flow and are in general unknown .",
    "however , a scaling can be found in the limit of low noise .",
    "it was shown that if an equilibrium @xmath76 has expanding directions @xmath62 and @xmath250 , with expanding eigenvalues @xmath251 , then in the limit of low noise , ( i.e.  as @xmath83 ) the transition probability from @xmath76 to @xmath252 scales as @xmath253      for some applications , it may be desirable for a network to have memory effects , i.e. where the transition probabilities depend on the recent history of the trajectory taken through the network .",
    "it is possible to create memory effects in a noisy heteroclinic network that has `` lift - off '' , an effect noted by stone , armbruster and kirk  @xcite that appears for attracting heteroclinic ( but not homoclinic ) networks with low amplitude additive noise .",
    "lift - off is a property of the distribution of the coordinates of a trajectory as it enters a neighborhood of an equilibrium such that the probability distribution of coordinates of trajectories in a poincar section becomes multi - modal and is a mechanism by which the transition probabilities can gain memory .",
    "we demonstrate the idea of lift - off in figure  [ fig : h2 in ] , which shows the poincar section @xmath254 for the schematic in figure  [ fig : psects ] , and a representation of the distribution of the coordinates of the incoming trajectories . if no lift - off occurs , then the distribution of coordinates is approximately gaussian and centered at zero , as shown on the left . if lift - off occurs , then the distribution of a particular coordinate is no longer gaussian and may include several peaks , as shown on the right .",
    "the transition probabilities can be thought of as intersections of the distribution of incoming trajectories with the set of points that progress to a given equilibrium at the next epoch . as lift - off changes this area of intersection and",
    "depends on the previously epochs , lift - off can affect transition probabilities and make them depend on memory .",
    "the occurrence of lift - off depends on the eigenvalues of the equilibria , and hence can be controlled .",
    "note that a sufficient condition for lift - off _ not _ to occur is that all contracting eigenvalues are greater than all expanding eigenvalues .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that if the network contains a heteroclinic connection @xmath255 , then there is the possibility of creating lift - off in the @xmath47 direction as the trajectory exits a neighbourhood of the equilibrium @xmath59 . if this lift - off can be maintained until the trajectory next approaches an equilibrium with an unstable manifold which connects to @xmath76 , the probability of visiting @xmath76 will be higher than if the lift - off had not occurred",
    ".    stone and armburster  @xcite compute conditions on the eigenvalues for lift - off to occur .",
    "they show that , if there exists a connection @xmath255 , lift - off will occur at @xmath59 ( that is , in the distribution of coordinates of trajectories leaving a neighbourhood of @xmath59 ) in the @xmath47 direction if @xmath256 where @xmath242 is the expanding direction at @xmath59 .",
    "that is , if this condition is satisfied , then the distribution of the @xmath47 coordinate , as the trajectory exits a neighbourhood of @xmath59 , is not centered about zero but instead is centered about a point whose distance from the connection scales as @xmath257 in the low noise limit @xmath83 . since the distribution of the noise is symmetric about zero , the lift - off has equal probability of occurring in either the positive or negative direction .",
    "this means that the distribution becomes multimodal . since the global flow only scales the distribution of coordinates by an amount that is order one in @xmath229 , the incoming distribution to the next equilibrium will scale similarly .    it is straightforward to extend the calculations of  @xcite to a sequence of heteroclinic connections between equilibria @xmath258 .",
    "that is , we already have conditions that the distribution of the @xmath47 coordinate as it exits a neighbourhood of @xmath59 is not centered about zero , and we can extend the computations to give conditions that the distribution of the @xmath47 coordinate as the trajectory exits a neighbourhood of @xmath259 is similarly not centered about zero .",
    "these calculations are a simple extension of those given in  @xcite , and it can be shown that @xmath260 implies that the distribution of the @xmath47 coordinate as the trajectory exits a neighbourhood of @xmath259 is centered about a point whose distance from the connection scales as @xmath261 in low noise limit @xmath83 . again , since the global flow only scales coordinates by an order one amount , the incoming distribution of the @xmath47 coordinate at equilibrium @xmath252 will then also not be centered at zero . thus , if condition   on the eigenvalues is satisfied , and @xmath252 has an unstable manifold ( of dimension two or more ) which includes the direction towards @xmath76 , then the proportion of trajectories which go towards @xmath76 will be higher than if lift - off had not occurred",
    "note that lift - off occurs only if the contracting eigenvalues are small enough , that is , if there is not enough contraction in the @xmath47 direction at @xmath259 to ` squash ' the lift - off .",
    "further extension of these calculations will give conditions on lift - off being maintained over longer sequences of equilibria , and hence the possibility of longer term memory .",
    "however , as lift - off requires sufficiently small contracting eigenvalues `` on average '' , and stability of the network requires sufficiently large contracting eigenvalues , we conjecture that any memory effects present must appear of a sequence of epochs that is smaller than the longest cycle within the network .",
    "in this section , we numerically investigate the properties described in section  [ sec : stats ] for the decision graph realised using the simplex realisation of section  [ sec : decision ] .",
    "note that whilst it is comparatively easy to check for the presence of memory in solution trajectories , checking for the _ absence _ of memory is difficult .",
    "that is , although we can perform statistical tests to show that a trajectory may be zeroth order rather than first order markov , checking for the absence of all long - term memory effects is hard . whilst we expect that such long term memory ( i.e. over sequences of more than two equilibria ) is possible , it seems unlikely to occur in the absence of short term memory except in special cases .",
    "a detailed study of long - term memory is beyond the scope of this paper and so in the following sections we discuss only the presence or absence of short - term memory .",
    "first , we consider a particular case where we predict that the network is memoryless , that is , there is no lift - off , and so the incoming distributions of all coordinates at each equilibria are gaussians centered at zero .",
    "we confirm the scaling given in section  [ sec : trans_prob ] for the transition probabilities in the decision graph by performing numerical integrations at various noise levels .",
    "we use parameters @xmath262 and integrate for noise levels @xmath263 . for each noise level",
    "we integrate until the number of passes the trajectory makes through @xmath175 is @xmath264 .    at each noise level",
    ", we measure the number of visits the trajectory makes to the equilibria @xmath176 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 , as a proportion of the number of visits to @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath176 respectively . in terms of the definitions given in section  [ sec : stats ] , these are approximations of @xmath267 respectively , using approximations ( [ eq : approxprob ] ) and @xmath268 with standard errors .",
    "these proportions are plotted against the noise level in figure  [ fig : props_noise ] on log - log axes .",
    "best fit linear regressions for each of these lines have slopes 0.072 , 0.074 and 0.073 respectively ; note that the expected slope for all three is @xmath269 .",
    "this means that in the low noise limit @xmath83 we predict that almost all itineraries follow the cycle @xmath270 corresponding to simply selecting the most unstable expanding direction at each equilibrium .",
    "note that without knowing details about the global part of the flow , it is not possible to predict the precise transition probabilities for particular noise levels and eigenvalues , the best we can do is get the scaling for low noise .",
    "however , if a particular transition probability is desired , a little experimentation and alteration of noise levels can achieve this .",
    "we now demonstrate an example of how lift - off as described in section  [ sec : liftoff ] can create memory in a network .",
    "we use the decision graph with the simplex realisation as an example , and induce lift - off in the @xmath247 direction at @xmath271 .",
    "we give two examples : in the first the lift - off is maintained until the trajectory reaches @xmath239 . in this example , we expect that trajectories which visit @xmath271 will then have a larger probability of visiting @xmath240 on the next circuit of the network than they would have done had they previously visited @xmath265 , @xmath272 or @xmath266 . in the second example",
    ", we exhibit parameters such that the lift - off is not maintained at @xmath239 , and consequently there are no memory effects .",
    "the particular structure of the decision graph can be used to simplify our analysis .",
    "note that the sequence of equilibria visited ( that is , the sequence @xmath273 ) can be deduced by only recording which of the equilibria @xmath271 , @xmath265 , @xmath272 and @xmath266 was visited by the trajectory on each ` loop ' around the network , and we therefore focus just on transitions between this subset of equilibria .",
    "specifically , we consider the sub - itinerary @xmath274 of ( [ eq : itinerary ] ) that consist of visits to @xmath275 by choosing the minimal strictly increasing set of indices @xmath276 such that @xmath277 observe that from the structure of the decision graph in figure  [ fig : decisiongraph ] we expect that @xmath278 on most occasions , and note also that we can have one - cycles ( non - trivial transitions from @xmath148 straight back to @xmath148 ) in this induced graph .",
    "using the corresponding definitions for proportions of visits and transition probabilities between this subset of equilibria we define for any sequence of @xmath279 : @xmath280 analogously to ( [ eq : approxprob ] ) we can compute this from a typical trajectory as @xmath281 and so define the probability @xmath282 of the first epoch being close to @xmath283 : @xmath284 assuming @xmath285 , we define the transition probability between vertices @xmath220 and @xmath221 by : @xmath286    we perform numerical integrations using the heun method ( with timestep @xmath287 ) for the cases with and without memory , and observe the effects in two ways .",
    "first , we compute the observed number of transitions between this subset of equilibria to estimate the matrix of probabilities @xmath288 for @xmath289 .",
    "a @xmath290-squared test is used to determine whether or not the probabilities of visiting each of the equilibria are independent of the previous state of the trajectory .",
    "we also directly observe the distribution of coordinates as trajectories enter and leave neighbourhoods of equilibria . from the results in section  [ sec : liftoff ] , we know that lift - off at @xmath271 in the @xmath247 direction occurs if @xmath291 . this lift - off will still exist after the trajectory when the trajectory enters a neighbourhood of @xmath239 if @xmath292 .",
    "we first perform an experiment where both conditions are satisfied , and then an experiment where only the first condition is satisfied .",
    "we choose parameters so that @xmath293 and integrate the equations for the decision graph simplex realisation , with noise @xmath294 , and for total time @xmath295 , giving a sequence of @xmath296 epochs and so @xmath297 cycles .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath298 for all @xmath148 , @xmath57 except for @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 for all @xmath148 , @xmath57 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 .    for a randomly chosen initial condition and noise path",
    ", the following matrix is the observed number of transitions between equilibria @xmath271 , @xmath265 , @xmath272 and @xmath266 in the reduced system : @xmath306 which gives an approximation to the matrix @xmath288 : @xmath307 where standard errors are of order @xmath308 , i.e. @xmath309 .",
    "hence , if a trajectory visits @xmath271 , it is more likely to go via @xmath240 ( and hence to @xmath271 or @xmath265 rather than @xmath272 or @xmath266 ) on its next circuit around the network .",
    "a @xmath290-squared test confirms this by rejection the null hypothesis that the transition probabilities are independent of the previous equilibrium visited .",
    "figure  [ fig : x4_liftoff ] demonstrates the lift - off by showing distributions of the @xmath310 and @xmath247 coordinates as the trajectory passes from equilibria @xmath271 to @xmath175 .",
    "we plot the coordinates as the trajectory crosses appropriate poincar sections : @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 , using @xmath208 . on @xmath311",
    ", @xmath247 is of order @xmath231 , and the coordinate of interest is @xmath310 .",
    "figure  [ fig : x4_liftoff](a ) shows this to clearly be approximately gaussian centered at zero .",
    "figures  [ fig : x4_liftoff](b ) to ( d ) show distributions of the @xmath247 coordinate on @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 . in each of these three cases ,",
    "the distribution is clearly not gaussian , but instead is approximately the sum of two gaussians shifted to the right and left of zero .",
    "this demonstrates the lift - off of the trajectory both in the positive and negative directions , on different loops around the network .",
    "the conditional distributions in figure  [ fig : all_scatter ] clearly show the memory effect via a scatter plot of the @xmath247 and @xmath248 coordinates of the trajectory on @xmath314 , conditional on the previously visited cycle .",
    "the conditional distribution peaks are clearly different as only those that went past @xmath265 at the last cycle display lift - off .",
    "+      we now explore a second example with same parameters as in section  [ sec : ex_mem ] , except that @xmath315 , so @xmath316 this means we expect to see lift - off in the @xmath247 direction at @xmath271 , but after the trajectory has passed @xmath175 this lift - off will be ` squashed ' and hence the distribution of the @xmath247 coordinate as the trajectory enters a neighbourhood of @xmath239 will be gaussian again . thus the network will have no memory .",
    "again , we integrate for time @xmath295 , which gives a sequence of @xmath317 cycles .    for an example run , the observed number of transitions between equilibria @xmath271 , @xmath265 , @xmath272 , and @xmath266 is : @xmath318 which gives the following approximation to @xmath319 : @xmath320 with standard errors of order @xmath309 . in this case",
    "the @xmath290-squared test does not reject the null hypothesis of independence for this transition matrix .",
    "figure  [ fig : x4_noliftoff ] shows the distribution of the @xmath247 coordinate ( for those trajectories which pass through @xmath271 ) on @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "it can clearly be seen that there is lift - off in the @xmath247 direction before @xmath175 , but on exiting , the distribution has returned to being approximately gaussian with zero mean ; this is shown as a scatter plot in figure  [ fig : all_scatter_no_lo ] where , in contrast to the case in figure  [ fig : all_scatter ] , the distributions do not appear to depend on previous epochs and so the system is memoryless .",
    "we have shown that , in principle , any finite directed graph can be realised as an embedded attracting robust heteroclinic network for a coupled cell system .",
    "in fact the method should work even if the network is not connected ( respectively , if the components are not strongly connected ) - in these cases the resulting network will be disconnected ( respectively , the asymptotic dynamics will be contained within a subnetwork ) .",
    "there are clearly issues at vertices of high degree for outgoing edges - there must be nontrivial dynamics such as additional saddle points involved in separating trajectories that go to different edges .",
    "we have not been able to prove all we would like to concerning the dynamics of the constructed networks ; in particular we have not been able to characterize the larger embedding network @xmath82 for either simplex or cylinder realisations .",
    "nonetheless , our numerical examples suggest that the dynamics is robust enough to be useful as a method for designing dynamical systems with specific graph attractors in phase space",
    ".    the noisy networks will be qualitatively robust to perturbations of parameters up to the point where the network undergoes one of a number of possible bifurcations . as suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures 14 and 15 ) , one bifurcation that will destroy the heteroclinic network and replace it with an excitable network is when one of the vertices becomes locally stable via a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "at such a pitchfork bifurcation , new saddles will be created whose stable manifolds give excitability thresholds - the connections no longer form a chain recurrent set .",
    "another bifurcation will be a resonance that causes the network to lose stability and results in bifurcation of periodic or other attractors from the network . unlike the heteroclinic networks considered in @xcite we do not expect the networks we consider to appear in primary bifurcations from a trivial state - the symmetries we require for robustness do not act transitively on the set of cells .",
    "we do not expect it will be possible to remove the constraint of no 1-cycles that is required by both constructions , except by lifting any graph with 1-cycles to a larger graph that has no 1-cycles . because of the constraints of transversality , it is not possible for a dissipative system to have a robust homoclinic cycle to a hyperbolic equilibrium , even if the perturbations are constrained to leave certain subspaces invariant .",
    "this is because , within the smallest invariant subspace that contains the connection , there will be a transverse intersection that will be broken by small perturbations .      for a given typical trajectory",
    "we define @xmath321 to be the probability that the trajectory is near @xmath76 , that is : @xmath322 to be the cardinality of @xmath321 , i.e. the number of times a trajectory visits the equilibria @xmath76 .",
    "this can be used to define the _ mean residence time _ of the trajectory close to the vertex @xmath76 : @xmath323 in this paper we do not examine properties of @xmath324 except to remark that this is a very interesting and nontrivial question @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the mean passage time of a trajectory past an equilibrium ( that is , the length of time during which the trajectory remains in a neighbourhood of an equilibrium ) for a heteroclinic cycle in the limit of low noise @xmath83 is @xmath325 where @xmath326 is the largest expanding eigenvalue for equilibrium @xmath76 and @xmath231 is the neighbourhood size . for a heteroclinic network in the presence of noise ,",
    "the passage time will be similar , though if there are several expanding eigenvalues , it is possible that the transition time may depend on the exit route , in this way the mean residence times may in fact encode the perturbations of the system to inputs with non - zero mean @xcite .",
    "the constructions presented here should give flexible tools for designing coupled cell systems that realise finite - state computational systems .",
    "they suggest new ways to adapt coupled cell systems systems to `` learn '' networks , by modifying parameters @xcite . an interesting question is whether either of the constructions can adapted to explain neural computations that proceed on a dynamical basis .",
    "simple network models of coupled neurons @xcite can give rise to various structures of heteroclinic network in phase space and we believe the constructions here can be used to extend this to more realistic decision making systems .    in applications , it may also be desirable to have control over the statistical properties of how a trajectory moves around the heteroclinic network",
    ". we may also want to control the occurrence of memory effects in the network where transition probabilities depend on the recent history of the route taken around the network ; the methods in section  [ sec : stats ] offers a route for doing this .",
    "there are many further questions that one could ask about the resulting designed networks - these include , for example : can one design a network that has not only the given network structure , but also a specified set of average residence times and/or transition probabilities ( with or without `` memory '' ) ?",
    "this is likely to be an interesting and challenging problem where inclusion of anisotropic noise may be important @xcite .",
    "other questions concern the limits on memory effects within such systems and behaviour of the system at larger noise levels .",
    "finally , we should comment that the realisation methods here are not very efficient in terms of the dimension of the system - the phase space dimension scales linearly with the number of vertices ( resp .",
    "edges ) for the simplex ( resp .",
    "cylinder ) realisations .",
    "this could be a barrier to using these results as a paradigm for neural computation where the encoding may be very dense .",
    "by contrast , the number of vertices for `` odd graph '' networks is very efficient - using only @xmath327 globally coupled phase oscillators we can find heteroclinic networks with @xmath328 vertices @xcite .",
    "however , as previously highlighted , the latter networks are not easily adaptable to computation because of their complex topology and large number of symmetries .",
    "hence it is interesting challenge to find a way to robustly realise a noisy heteroclinic attractor in a `` minimal '' dimension network .",
