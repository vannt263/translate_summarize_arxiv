    "neutrino experiments have provided a convincing evidence that neutrinos oscillate among different flavors .",
    "the experimental data collected over more than a decade imply that at least two neutrinos have nonzero mass and that there is mixing in the lepton sector , in analogy to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing in the quark sector .",
    "yet neutrinos have surprised us since their properties are quite different from those of charged fermions .",
    "table 1 reports our present knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters obtained by the analysis of the global @xmath0 oscillation data .",
    "@xcite although neutrino oscillation experiments are not sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass scale , direct kinematical searches and cosmological bounds set @xmath1  ev . thus neutrinos are at least six orders of magnitude lighter than the other fermions in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "their mass hierarchies among generations also turn out to be different from those of charged leptons and quarks . in particular",
    ", there is a mild neutrino hierarchy @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , for the charged - lepton masses , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the quark mass relations @xmath5 are verified .",
    "the mixing pattern in the lepton sector also looks quite distinct from its analogue in the quark sector .",
    "indeed , while the ckm matrix exhibits a small mixing pattern , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) lepton mixing matrix has two large mixing angles : the solar @xmath6 and atmospheric @xmath7 . the third angle @xmath8 is mainly constrained by the reactor data to be small , @xmath9 and , from the combined global data",
    ", there is a hint for a nonzero @xmath8 .",
    "recent data from t2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite experiments also indicate a relatively large value for @xmath8 . at 90% c.l . , the t2k data are consistent with @xmath10 for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy in the absence of dirac cp violation .",
    "the minos collaboration reports the best - fit values @xmath11 .",
    "if these results are confirmed , they will have strong impact on neutrino physics and , particularly , will open the window for the possibility of detecting leptonic cp violation .",
    "another puzzling aspect of neutrinos is their nature . in the sm neutrinos",
    "are strictly massless .",
    "this is so because no right - handed ( rh ) neutrino fields are introduced , thus preventing a dirac mass term for them .",
    "no majorana mass term of the form @xmath12 can be either generated since such term would violate @xmath13 , which is an exact symmetry in the sm , conserved at the quantum level .",
    "if rh neutrino fields are added to the sm particle content , neutrinos could then be either dirac or majorana particles .",
    "yet , theoretically , the latter appear to be more natural .",
    "indeed , a dirac neutrino mass would require extremely small yukawa couplings @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , a majorana mass term can be interpreted as the lowest - order effective operator beyond the sm , namely , the dimension - five weinberg operator @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath17 stands for the lepton doublet , and @xmath18 is a mass scale associated to some new physics .",
    "@xcite then , after electroweak symmetry breaking , neutrinos would acquire a majorana mass @xmath19 , which can be easily suppressed if the scale @xmath18 is much higher than the electroweak scale @xmath20 , without the need of unnaturally small yukawa couplings .",
    "this approach is commonly referred to as the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "the seesaw is a simple and attractive mechanism for the realization of the weinberg operator in gauge theories . in this framework ,",
    "the effective operator is induced by the exchange of mediator particles with a mass scale @xmath18 .",
    "depending on the su(2 ) representation of the mediators , several seesaw realizations are conceivable for neutrino mass generation .",
    "the most common are the type - i ( singlet rh neutrinos ) , type - ii ( triplet scalars ) and type - iii ( triplet fermions ) seesaw mechanisms . such representations are commonly present in grand unified theories .",
    "for instance , rh neutrinos nicely fit into the * 16 * spinorial representation of so(10 ) .    introducing in the sm right - handed neutrinos @xmath21 with heavy masses",
    "@xmath22 is one of the simplest possibilities to generate light neutrino masses . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the case of three rh neutrinos , i.e. one for each fermion generation .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the @xmath27 dirac - neutrino yukawa coupling matrix and @xmath28 is the @xmath27 symmetric rh neutrino mass matrix . integrating out the heavy majorana fields in eq .  , and",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the effective neutrino mass matrix is given by the seesaw relation @xmath29 therefore , for sufficiently large majorana masses @xmath22 , the required light neutrino masses @xmath30 can be naturally reproduced . in the basis where the charged - lepton yukawa couplings are diagonal",
    ", the matrix @xmath31 is diagonalized by the @xmath27 unitary pmns leptonic mixing matrix @xmath32 , @xmath33    light neutrino masses can be generated from other high - scale seesaw mechanisms in a similar manner .",
    "as a bonus , seesaw models also give the possibility of implementing leptogenesis ,  @xcite i.e. the generation of a lepton asymmetry in early universe due to the out - of - equilibrium and cp - violating decays of the seesaw mediators .",
    "this asymmetry will be subsequently converted into a baryon asymmetry , thus offering a dynamical explanation for the absence of any primordial antimatter in the observable universe .      the neutrino oscillation data in table  1 hint at certain symmetry properties in the leptonic mixing .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the @xmath34 mass eigenstate is quite equally mixed with all three flavors @xmath35 ( trimaximal mixing ) , whereas @xmath36 is almost equally mixed with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( bimaximal mixing ) and contains a very small @xmath39 component .",
    "this peculiar flavor structure has led many authors to look for underlying flavor symmetries compatible with the data .",
    "@xcite discrete groups such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 have been widely used in several proposals .",
    "@xcite in this context , the permutation group @xmath40 has been quite popular since it is particularly suitable to reproduce the tribimaximal mixing  @xcite @xmath49 which is consistent at @xmath50 level with the experimental data .",
    "an attractive feature of mass - independent mixing schemes such as @xmath51 is that they lead to a predictive neutrino mass matrix , which contains just a few parameters that can be directly related to low - energy neutrino observables ( e.g. the neutrino mass - squared differences , the absolute neutrino mass scale , and the effective mass parameter in neutrinoless double beta decays ) .",
    "it is nevertheless fair to say that constructing neutrino mass models based on flavor symmetries is not an easy task .",
    "additional discrete and/or continuous symmetries are typically required to guarantee the correct vacuum alignment and mass hierarchies , thus making these models quite intricate .    in the light of the recent t2k results , models that lead to tribimaximal mixing",
    "appear to be disfavored . in general , deviations from @xmath52 in these models can not bring @xmath8 into agreement with data without spoiling the predictions for the solar and atmospheric mixing angles .",
    "several alternative solutions have been recently put forward to explain a relatively large value of @xmath8 in the framework of discrete flavor symmetries .",
    "@xcite    it is also remarkable that the imposition of certain flavor symmetries in the lepton sector of the theory may lead to severe constraints on the leptonic cp asymmetries relevant for leptogenesis in the framework of seesaw models . in particular , in type - i and type - iii seesaw flavor models that lead to an exact mass - independent leptonic mixing the leptogenesis cp asymmetries are zero in leading order .",
    "@xcite by contrast , in a type - ii seesaw framework the leptonic cp asymmetries are in general nonzero and leptogenesis is viable .",
    "no primordial antimatter is found in our observable universe . from the analysis of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) seven - year data combined with baryon acoustic oscillations",
    "it is inferred that  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the number densities of baryons , antibaryons and photons , respectively .",
    "remarkably , this result is also consistent with the one obtained from the concordance of the light elements and big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the explanation of such a tiny but nonzero number poses a challenge to both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "wmap measurements have also made it clear that the current state of the universe is very close to a critical density and that the primordial density perturbations that seeded large - scale structure formation are nearly scale invariant and gaussian , which is consistent with the inflationary paradigm . since",
    "any primordial asymmetry would have been exponentially wiped out during the inflationary period , one then expects the baryon asymmetry to be generated by some dynamical mechanism after inflation .",
    "the necessary ingredients for such a dynamical recipe have been formulated long ago by sakharov : b - violation , c and cp - violation , and departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xcite    it is noteworthy that the sm contains the three sakharov ingredients . yet",
    "not all of them are available in a sufficient amount .",
    "baryon number is violated by the electroweak sphaleron processes , which are fast and unsuppressed in early universe .",
    "the c symmetry is maximally violated by the weak interactions , and cp is violated by the ckm phase , but not enough to generate the required asymmetry @xmath56 .",
    "finally , at the electroweak phase transition departure from thermal equilibrium takes place .",
    "however , a successful baryogenesis requires a strongly first order phase transition , which can only occur if the higgs mass is less than 60  gev , i.e. in a mass range that is already excluded by the experimental electroweak data .",
    "thus the explanation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry requires new physics beyond the sm .      among the viable dynamical scenarios to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry , leptogenesis is undoubtedly one of the simplest , most attractive and well - motivated mechanisms .",
    "@xcite new heavy particles are introduced in the theory in such a way that the interactions relevant for leptogenesis are simultaneously responsible for the seesaw neutrino masses .",
    "the three sakharov conditions are naturally fulfilled in this framework : ( i ) the seesaw mechanism requires lepton number violation and nonperturbative @xmath57-violating sphaleron processes will partially reprocess the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry ; ( ii ) neutrino complex yukawa couplings provide the necessary source of cp violation ; ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium is accomplished by the out - of - equilibrium decays of the new heavy particles at temperatures above the electroweak scale .    as an illustrative example ,",
    "let us consider again the case of the sm extended with three rh neutrinos .",
    "the relevant interactions are described by the type - i seesaw lagrangian of eq .  .",
    "working in the mass eigenbasis of the charged leptons @xmath58 , and in the mass eigenbasis @xmath59 of the rh neutrinos @xmath21 , the cp asymmetry @xmath60 in the lepton flavor @xmath61 produced in the @xmath59 decays is given by @xmath62}\\nonumber \\\\           & = \\frac{1}{8\\pi\\mathbf{h}_{ii}^{\\nu}}\\sum_{j \\neq i } \\bigl\\ { \\text{im}\\left[\\mathbf{y}^{\\nu\\ast}_{\\alpha i } \\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{ij } \\mathbf{y}^\\nu_{\\alpha j}\\right]\\,\\bigl(f(x )           + g(x)\\bigr ) + \\text{im}\\left[\\mathbf{y}^{\\nu\\ast}_{\\alpha i}\\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{ji } \\mathbf{y}^\\nu_{\\alpha j}\\right ] g^\\prime(x)\\bigr\\ } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , \\ ,    g(x ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}\\,(1-x)}{(x-1)^2+\\gamma_{n_j}^2/m_i^2}=g^\\prime(x)\\sqrt{x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath66 is the total tree - level decay rate of @xmath59 . the cp asymmetry @xmath60 is obtained from the interference of the tree - level and one - loop diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . summing over the lepton flavors ,",
    "one obtains the unflavored asymmetry @xmath67 \\,\\bigl(f(x ) + g(x)\\bigr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the universe reheats to a thermal bath composed of particles with gauge interactions after inflation , the final baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath56 can be estimated as the product of three suppression factors : ( the leptonic cp asymmetry @xmath68 in @xmath59-decays ) @xmath69 ( an efficiency factor @xmath70 due to washout processes in scattering , decays and inverse decays ) @xmath69 ( a reduction factor due to chemical equilibrium , charge conservation and the redistribution of the asymmetry among different particle species ) .",
    "in particular , the final efficiency factor @xmath70 is computed by solving numerically the relevant boltzmann equations , which describe the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the processes responsible for leptogenesis .",
    "simple analytical estimates can be obtained in some specific regimes .",
    "@xcite    traditionally , the unflavored regime has been considered , assuming also a heavy majorana neutrino mass hierarchy @xmath71 ( the so - called @xmath72-dominated scenario ) . in this oversimplified setup",
    ", one can show that the cp asymmetry has an upper bound , @xmath73 . to reproduce the observed value given in eq .",
    ", two constraints must then be satisfied : a lower bound on @xmath74 and the reheating temperature @xmath75 independent of the initial conditions , @xmath76  gev , and an upper bound on the light neutrino mass scale , @xmath77  ev .  @xcite another notable feature of the unflavored asymmetry is that it does not depend directly on the parameters of the pmns mixing matrix @xmath32 .",
    "this raises the question of whether there is a direct link between leptogenesis and low - energy neutrino observables .",
    "as it turns out , any link can only be established in a model - dependent way , and imposing certain conditions on the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite    going beyond the simple @xmath72-dominated approximation , it is possible to relax the bounds on @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath78 , i.e. when the rh neutrinos are quasi - degenerate in mass , the flavored @xmath60 and unflavored @xmath68 asymmetries are resonantly enhanced by the self - energy corrections depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , @xmath79\\ , \\text{im}\\left[\\mathbf{y}^{\\nu\\ast}_{\\alpha i }   \\mathbf{y}^\\nu_{\\alpha j}\\right]}{\\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{ii}\\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{jj } } , \\quad \\epsilon_{i } \\simeq -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{j \\neq i } \\frac{\\text{im}\\left[(\\mathbf{h}_{ij}^{\\nu})^2\\right ] } { \\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{ii}\\mathbf{h}^\\nu_{jj}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although theoretically challenging , it is possible to construct models in which the heavy majorana neutrino mass splitting is naturally as small as the decay width at the leptogenesis scale . in the radiative resonant leptogenesis scenario ,",
    "the required splitting can be generated by renormalization group running effects , assuming that the heavy majorana neutrinos are exactly degenerate at the gut scale .  @xcite    recently , it has also been emphasized that lepton flavor effects can play a significant role in leptogenesis .",
    "@xcite when the interactions mediated by the charged lepton yukawa couplings are in thermal equilibrium , the flavored leptonic asymmetries and the boltzmann equations for individual flavor asymmetries must be taken into account . since interactions involving the @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) yukawa couplings are in equilibrium for @xmath82  gev , the corresponding lepton doublets are distinguishable mass eigenstates below these temperatures and should be properly introduced into the dynamics . in the flavored regime ,",
    "the arguments leading to the upper bound on @xmath68 do not apply , and the leptogenesis efficiency factors can be larger than in the unflavored case . furthermore , the parameters in the mixing matrix @xmath32 directly affect the final baryon asymmetry so that it becomes possible to have successful leptogenesis just from low - energy leptonic cp violation.@xcite",
    "the possibility of linking neutrino physics to the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry obviously raises the question about the testability of the seesaw and leptogenesis mechanisms . since heavy states and/or very small yukawa couplings",
    "are typically present , achieving this goal is not straightforward .",
    "there is however a hope that colliders such as the lhc will shed some light on the majorana nature of neutrinos and , in some cases , probe the seesaw as well .",
    "smoking gun signatures would be the detection of neutrinoless double beta decay and the production of same - sign lepton pairs at colliders .",
    "@xcite testing leptogenesis seems more difficult , and the success of this task will depend on the energy scale at which leptogenesis takes place and the type of seesaw related to it .",
    "@xcite in any case , the upcoming years are expected to be another exciting golden era for neutrino physics , and future experiments may provide important clues to some of the still unanswered questions .",
