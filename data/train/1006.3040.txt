    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) has achieved substantial success at predicting short wavelength statistical properties of spectra , eigenfunctions , scattering matrices , impedance matrices , and conductance of wave - chaotic systems @xcite . by wave - chaotic systems , we mean that the behavior of the wave system in the small wavelength limit is described by ray orbit trajectories that are chaotic @xcite . in practice",
    ", the experimental applicability of rmt requires consideration of nonuniversal effects .",
    "for example , in the particular case of scattering , the scattering properties of an open system depend on the coupling between the field within the scattering region and the asymptotic incoming and outgoing waves connecting the exterior to the scatterer .",
    "for this problem , researchers have developed methods to incorporate nonuniversal coupling and port - specific effects into the analysis of short wavelength scattering data for systems whose closed classical counterparts are ray - chaotic @xcite .",
    "previous comparisons of experimental data to rmt have often employed ensembles of realizations of the system to compile statistics . to create such ensembles ,",
    "researchers have typically varied the geometrical configuration of the scattering region and/or taken measurements at several different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "these variations aim to create a set of systems in which none of the nonuniversal system details are reproduced from one realization to another , except for the effects of the port details .",
    "thus , by suitably accounting for the port details , it was hoped that only universal rmt properties remained in the ensemble data .",
    "however , there can be problems in practice .",
    "for example , in the case of geometrical configuration variation , researchers typically move perturbing objects inside a ray - chaotic enclosure with fixed shape and size @xcite , or move one wall of that enclosure @xcite , to create an ensemble of systems with varying details .",
    "the problem is that certain walls or other scattering objects of the enclosure remain fixed throughout the ensemble .",
    "therefore , there may exist relevant ray trajectories that remain unchanged in many or all realizations of the ensemble .",
    "we term such ray trajectories that leave a port and soon return to it ( or another port ) before ergodically sampling the enclosure `` short ray trajectories '' .",
    "a similar problem arises for wavelength variation in which a band of wavelengths is used . within a wavelength range , if a ray trajectory length is too short , then the variation of the phase accumulated by a wave following that trajectory may not be large enough to be considered random .",
    "in such a case the effects of specific ( hence , nonuniversal ) short ray trajectories will survive the ensemble averaging processes described above .",
    "these problems will make systematic , nonuniversal contributions to the ensemble data , and thus consideration of short ray trajectories arises naturally in the semiclassical approach to quantum scattering theory @xcite .",
    "such short - ray - trajectory contributions have been noted before in microwave billiards @xcite or for quantum transport in chaotic cavities @xcite and have either constrained or frustrated previous tests of rmt predictions .    by a `` short ray trajectory '' we mean one",
    "whose length is not much longer than several times the characteristic size of the scattering region , and which enters the scattering region from a port , bounces ( perhaps several times ) within the scattering region , and then returns to a port .",
    "a `` port '' is the region in which there is a connection from the scatterer to the outside world . for illustrative purposes , in what follows we consider systems with either one or two ports ; as discussed elsewhere ,",
    "generalization of our results to more ports is straightforward @xcite .",
    "note that the short ray trajectories we refer to are different from periodic orbits @xcite , which are closed classical trajectories ; short ray trajectories , as defined here , are only important for open systems .",
    "although our explicit considerations in this paper are for billiard systems ( i.e. , scattering regions that are homogeneous with perfectly reflecting walls ) , presumably these effects may also be present with continuous potentials and are not limited to billiards .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the previous treatments to explicitly include additional nonuniversal effects due to short ray trajectories .",
    "previous work has examined short ray trajectories in cases where the system and the ports can be treated in the semiclassical approximation @xcite or considered the effect on eigenfunction correlations due to short ray trajectories associated with nearby walls @xcite .",
    "the effects of short ray trajectories on wave scattering properties of chaotic systems have been explicitly calculated before in the case of quantum graphs @xcite and for two dimensional billiards @xcite .",
    "moreover , microwave billiard experimental work has extracted a measure of the microwave power that is emitted at a certain point in the billiard and returns to the same point after following all possible classical trajectories of a given length @xcite .",
    "the poisson kernel approach can also be generalized to include short ray trajectories @xcite through measurement of a ( statistical ) optical s - matrix .",
    "none of this prior work developed a general first - principles deterministic approach to experimentally analyzing the effect of short ray trajectories , as we do here .",
    "this paper expands on a brief report of our preliminary results @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite demonstrated the effect of short trajectories in a one - port wave - chaotic cavity , and we generalize the short - trajectory correction to a two - port system in this paper .",
    "therefore , this generalized correction can be applied to multiple port cases by similar procedures .",
    "other new ingredients include detailed examination of the effect of individual short ray trajectories , and extension to the statistics of other wave scattering properties .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we summarize a theoretical approach for removing short ray trajectories from single - realization data and ensemble - averaged data of any wave properties of a wave scattering system . a detailed derivation of the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] is given elsewhere @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we describe experiments testing the theoretical approach , and we compare the experimental results and the theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "these comparisons show that compensation for the effects of short ray trajectories improves the agreement between rmt - based predictions and measured statistical properties of ensemble - averaged data and single - realization data .",
    "while much of our discussion above has emphasized the goal of uncovering rmt statistics , we also wish to emphasize that many of our results are also of interest independent of that goal .",
    "in particular , the key step in our approach for uncovering rmt statistics is that of obtaining a short - trajectory - based prediction for the average impedance over frequency and/or configurations ( secs .",
    "[ subsec : empty_cavity ] and [ subsec : ensemble ] ) , and we note that this quantity is both experimentally accessible and of interest in its own right . as another example , in sec .",
    "[ subsec : wall_cases ] we consider the modification of the free - space radiation impedance arising in configurations when there are only a few possible short ray trajectories , and this situation applies directly to many cases where , although reflecting objects are present , there is also substantial coupling to the outside .",
    "in this paper we consider for concreteness an effectively two dimensional microwave cavity ( described in sec . [ sec : experiment ] ) as the scattering system , and this cavity is connected to the outside world via one or two single - mode transmission lines terminated by antennas inside the scattering region , acting as ports .",
    "the results and techniques should carry over to other physically different wave systems ( e.g. , quantum waves , acoustic waves , etc . ) of higher dimension and an arbitrary number of ports @xcite .",
    "ray trajectories within the cavity are chaotic due to the shape of the cavity .",
    "previously most researchers focused on the scattering matrix @xmath0 @xcite , which specifies the linear relationship between reflected and incident wave amplitudes in the channels .",
    "we focus on an equivalent quantity , the impedance @xmath1 , because nonuniversal contributions manifest themselves in @xmath2 as simple additive corrections @xcite . here",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath3 gives the characteristic impedance of the scattering channels , and is measured at chosen reference planes on the transmission lines as the ratio of the ( complex ) transmission line voltage @xmath4 to current @xmath5 ( time variation @xmath6 is assumed ) .",
    "impedance is a meaningful concept for all scattering wave systems . in linear electromagnetic systems , it is defined via the phasor generalization of ohm s law as @xmath7 , and in the case of @xmath8 channels connected to the scatterer , @xmath2 is an @xmath9 matrix .",
    "a quantum - mechanical quantity corresponding to the impedance is the reaction matrix , which is often denoted in the literature as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in what follows our discussion will use language appropriate to the electromagnetic context and scattering from a microwave cavity excited by small antennas fed by transmission lines ( the setting for our experiments ) .",
    "our goal is to describe the universal rmt aspects of measurement of this impedance matrix ( alternatively of the scattering matrix ) .",
    "however , raw measurement of the impedance have nonuniversal properties because the waves are coupled to the cavity through the specific geometry of the junction between the transmission lines and the cavity . in prior work",
    ", the nonuniversal coupling effects were parameterized in terms of corrections to the impedance @xmath2 .",
    "the `` perfectly coupled '' normalized impedance @xmath11 removes nonuniversal features due to the ports @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radiation impedance , embodying the nonuniversal port properties .",
    "@xmath14 is the real part of @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the imaginary part . by ``",
    "perfectly coupled ''",
    "we mean that waves impinging on the cavity are fully transmitted to the cavity with no prompt reflection .",
    "note that these quantities are @xmath9 matrices for a system with @xmath8 ports .",
    "@xmath15 is the impedance measured at the previously mentioned reference planes on the transmission lines when the cavity walls are removed , so that the outgoing waves launched at the ports never return to these ports .",

    "note for the two - port experiment , we compute the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath166 , and @xmath168 is the phase of the eigenvalues .",
    "rmt predicts that @xmath168 should have a uniform distribution from 0 to @xmath171 independent of loss @xcite , as verified in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "[ fig : s_statistics ] illustrates the benefits of using short - trajectory - corrected data to examine the statistical properties of the scattering matrix .",
    "an ensemble of data is created by averaging 100 realizations of the cavity with the two perturbers present , between 6 and 18 ghz , encompassing about 1070 closed - cavity modes .",
    "theoretical short trajectory corrections are weighted by the survival probability ( @xmath53 ) which are calculated from the known locations of the perturbers .",
    "[ fig : s_statistics](a ) shows a representative probability distribution ( @xmath172 ) of the phase of eigenvalues of the normalized scattering matrix .",
    "the data for the normalized scattering matrix are formed by taking the measured impedance from each of the 100 realizations and normalizing with the radiation impedances @xmath15 or the theoretical impedance with short - trajectory correction @xmath173 , and these pdfs are computed from the data in a 500 mhz frequency range ( @xmath174 ghz ) . in this frequency range , it is clear that the distribution normalized with short trajectories is significantly closer to a uniform distribution than the one normalized without short trajectories .    to quantify this improvement , it is convenient to look at the average root - mean - square ( rms ) error with respect to the uniform distribution for the two types of normalization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s_statistics](b ) ) . here",
    "the rms error is defined as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the number of elements in the @xmath177 bin in the 10 bins histogram of @xmath172 , and @xmath178 is the mean of @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , when a distribution is more uniform , its rms error is smaller .",
    "the average rms error of each frequency window is averaged over the spectral range from 6 to 18 ghz , and fig .",
    "[ fig : s_statistics](b ) shows the average rms error versus the frequency window sizes from 10 mhz to 1.0 ghz .",
    "this figure shows that the distributions of data are systematically more uniform as more short trajectories are taken into account in the normalization for a given window size .",
    "the average rms error of the data normalized without short trajectories ( the radiation impedance only ( green circles ) ) has the largest error .",
    "when we include more short trajectories from the maximum lengths @xmath169 cm ( red triangles ) up to @xmath95 cm ( blue squares ) , the average rms errors decrease .",
    "the improvement is obvious after including short trajectories with @xmath169 cm , and it saturates for trajectories with @xmath179 cm . for comparison , we also add a curve ( pink stars ) for the data normalized by the measured ensemble averaged impedance @xmath149 ( the red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ensemble_impedance ] ) , and it is the most uniform case . it is observed that the improvement of statistical properties with short - trajectory corrections is more significant when the frequency window size is smaller .",
    "a theory for the nonuniversal effects of coupling and short ray trajectories on scattering wave - chaotic systems has been tested experimentally on a two - dimensional , wave - chaotic , electromagnetic cavity with one or two transmission line channels connecting to the outside .",
    "in particular , the theoretical predictions match the measured data in the cases of a frequency ensemble in a single realization and the configuration ensemble in the ensemble of 100 realizations . by removing nonuniversal effects from measured data , we can reveal underlying universally fluctuating quantities in the scattering and impedance matrices",
    ". these results should be useful in many fields where similar wave phenomena are of interest , such as nuclear scattering , atomic physics , quantum transport in condensed matter systems , electromagnetics , acoustics , geophysics , etc .",
