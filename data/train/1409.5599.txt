    "quantum systems may behave classically or quasiclassically under a variety of circumstances and , in this regard , the transition from quantum to classical mechanics still poses intriguing problems that attract considerable attention .",
    "of particular interest are systems that display both classical and quantum periodic motions , with generally different , incommensurable periods , for in this case the interesting question arises as to how the classical periodicity emerges from the quantum one in the appropriate limit . for instance , a particle of mass @xmath0 and energy @xmath1 in an infinite square - well potential of width @xmath2 initially oscillate with a classical period @xmath3 .",
    "the classical oscillations gradually damp out as the wave packet representing the particle spreads more or less uniformly across the well .",
    "quantum mechanically , the wave function regains exactly its initial form with a _ revival _ period @xmath4 , after which the classical oscillations resume with period @xmath5 again . at times that are rational fractions of @xmath6 ,",
    "the wave packet temporarily splits into a number of scaled copies called fractional revivals @xcite . in the same vein",
    ", an object of mass @xmath0 released from a height @xmath7 and subjected only to gravity , bounces up and down against an impenetrable flat surface with a classical period ( in suitable units ) @xmath8 , while the wave function of the corresponding quantum bouncer _",
    "almost _ returns to its initial shape after a revival time @xmath9 .",
    "after a revival has taken place , a new cycle of quasiclassical behavior and revivals commences again .",
    "the fact that in this case the revivals are only approximate does not make a difference .",
    "revivals and fractional revivals received a great deal of attention over the last decades .",
    "theoretical progress and experimental observations were made in atoms and molecules , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "recently , revivals have been theoretically investigated in low dimensional systems @xcite and have been related to quantum phase transitions @xcite .    identifying the occurrence of wave packet revivals",
    "usually makes use of the autocorrelation function @xmath10 , which is the overlap between the initial and the time - evolving wave packet . within this approach",
    ", the occurrence of revivals and fractional revivals corresponds to , respectively , the return of @xmath11 to its initial value of unity and the appearance of relative maxima in @xmath11 .",
    "another method to study revival phenomena consists in monitoring the time evolution of the expectation values of some quantities @xcite , and an approach based on a finite difference eigenvalue method has been put forward that allows to predict the revival times directly @xcite . recently , information entropy approaches were proposed @xcite based on the shannon and rnyi entropies , complementary to the conventional ones .",
    "this technique was shown to be superior to analyses based on both the standard variance uncertainty product @xcite and the autocorrelation function , inasmuch as it overcomes the difficulty that wave packets reform themselves at locations that do not coincide with their original ones .",
    "a complementary informational measure is the fisher information @xcite which has attracted substantial interest in physics , in particular in atomic and molecular physics ( see for example @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we show that the analysis of the wave packet dynamics can be carried out using a new tool , namely , the _ nonclassicality _ @xmath12 , defined in terms of the fisher information as we now discuss .",
    "hall @xcite has recently introduced a measure of nonclassicality , @xmath12 , in terms of the probability densities in position and momentum spaces , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . to be concrete , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the classical fisher informations associated with the probability densities @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . in the next section",
    "we shall show that the time evolution of a wave packet exhibiting revivals and fractional revivals is initially characterized by a classical behavior with a low @xmath12 value , followed by a wave packet spreading with a higher value of @xmath12 . in the long time evolution , for times near @xmath6 , the wave packet ( approximately ) restores its initial form , exhibiting classical periodicity again accompanied by a decrease in @xmath12 . in the case of fractional revivals at @xmath21 , several minipackets emerge whereupon a decrease in @xmath12 is expected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we shall consider the fisher information as it applies to revival phenomena .",
    "in particular , we show the role of the fisher information as a measure of nonclassicality in the dynamics of two model systems that exhibit fractional revivals : the so - called quantum ` bouncer ' , that is a quantum particle bouncing against a hard surface under the influence of gravity and the infinite square - well .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks will be given in the last section .",
    "the fisher information of single particle systems is defined as a functional of the density function in conjugate spaces by eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) and it has been shown to be a measure of nonclassicality @xcite . following hall @xcite and mosna et al .",
    "@xcite , the fisher information in position space can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the momentum operator and @xmath24 is a ( state - dependent ) classical momentum operator defined by @xmath25 hence , it is natural to separate the momentum operator in a classical ( @xmath24 ) and nonclassical ( @xmath26 ) contribution with @xmath27 .",
    "the definition of the classical momentum observable is supported by the facts that @xmath28 satisfies the classical continuity equation and that the expectation values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are equal for all wave functions @xmath29 @xcite . the conjugate equality that relates the momentum",
    "fisher information and the nonclassicality of the position operator can be obtained analogously , @xmath30 finally , hall introduced a measure of joint nonclassicality @xmath12 for a quantum state as @xmath31 it follows that @xmath32 for gaussian distributions .",
    "for instance , the evolution of gaussian wave packets in a harmonic oscillator follows a periodic motion in accordance with classical expectations @xcite , and @xmath32 for all times . for mixed states",

    "consider an object of mass @xmath0 bouncing against a hard surface subjected only to the influence of the gravitational force directed downward along the @xmath34 axis , that is , a particle in a potential @xmath35 , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 otherwise .",
    "gravitational quantum bouncers have been recently realized using neutrons @xcite and atomic clouds @xcite .",
    "their revival behavior has been discussed in @xcite and an entropy - based approach was presented in @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent wave function for a localized quantum wave packet is expanded as a one - dimensional superposition of energy eigenstates as @xmath38 the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a characteristic gravitational length , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , ai@xmath43 is the airy function , @xmath44 denotes its zeros , and @xmath45 is the @xmath46 normalization factor .",

    "the temporal evolution of the wave packet in momentum - space was obtained numerically by the fast fourier transform method .",
    "we have computed the temporal evolution of the autocorrelation function and the nonclassicality @xmath12 for the initial conditions @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath53 . figure [ f4 ] displays the early time evolution of both quantities and the location of the main fractional revivals .",
    "the top panel shows how the autocorrelation function initially follows the first classical periods of motion .",
    "the nonclassicality , @xmath12 , describes precisely this same behavior , with peaks at the wave packet s collapses and minima at the multiples of the classical period . in the long time limit , the wave packet eventually spreads out and collapses , only to reform at multiples of the revival time . in between , fractional",
    "revivals take place .",
    "all this is reflected in the maxima and relative maxima of @xmath62 as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "the alternative description in terms of @xmath12 is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . the slightly nonclassical behavior or , equivalently , the quasiclassical behavior that takes place at full and fractional revivals",
    "is described by , respectively , the minima and the relative minima of @xmath12 .",
    "finally , notice that the occurrence of fractional revivals at , for instance , @xmath63 or @xmath64 is clearly better indicated by @xmath12 than by @xmath62 .",
    "the one - dimensional infinite square - well potential confines a particle of mass @xmath0 to a box of width @xmath2 and is described by @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "the normalized eigenstates and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by , @xmath68 the classical period and the revival time can be computed as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "note that due to the fact that in this particular case the quantized energy levels are exactly quadratic in @xmath71 , there is no super - revival ( or higher - order effects in the evolution ) , nor does the revival period depend on the mean energy level @xmath56",
    ". the occurrence of revivals and fractional revivals can now be illustrated by simply taking @xmath72 in the expansion ( [ evolutionx ] ) , which immediately entails @xmath73 , with @xmath74 an integer @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of the infinite square - well is periodic with period @xmath6 , and this period is an exact revival time too .",
    "it is also easy to see by direct substitution in ( [ evolutionx ] ) that @xmath75 , so at time @xmath76 a copy of the initial state reforms itself , reflected around the center of the well @xcite",
    ".    we shall consider initial gaussian wave packets centered at a position @xmath77 , with a momentum @xmath50 and a variance @xmath49 , @xmath78 assuming that the integration region can be extended to the whole real axis due to the exponential functional form of ( [ paqueteinicial ] ) @xcite , the expansion coefficients can be approximated with high accuracy by the analytic expression @xmath79 }   \\sin\\left [ \\frac{n\\pi}{l } \\left(x_0+\\frac{ib^2p_0}{\\hbar } \\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . to calculate the corresponding time dependent , momentum wave function",
    "we use the fourier transform of the equation ( [ paqueteinicial ] ) , and the momentum - space normalized eigenstates @xmath83.\\ ] ] the initial wave packet in momentum space is then given by the fourier transform of the equation ( [ paqueteinicial ] ) , which leads again to a gaussian expression , @xmath84 without loss of generality , we shall henceforth take @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for the initial wave packet .",
    "we have computed the measure of nonclassicality @xmath12 and the autocorrelation function for an initial wave packet with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ suma400 ] .    at early times",
    ", the gaussian wave packet evolves quasiclassically but in a few periods the quantum and classical wave packet trajectories start moving apart , the classical component of the wave function being defined as @xmath89 @xcite . for long time scales , a large amplitude modulation with a set of relative minima is superimposed on the quasiperiodic oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ suma400 ] ) . in this long - time regime ,",
    "the wave packet initially spreads and delocalizes while undergoing a sequence of fractional revivals with the creation of correlated sets of sub - packets located along the classical orbit , each of them similar to the initial one so that the nonclassicality reaches a relative minimum , the most important fractional revivals are denoted by vertical dashed - lines .",
    "notice that at one half of the revival period there is an absolute minimum which corresponds to a single rejected copy of the initial wave function .",
    "to summarize , we have shown how the measure of nonclassicality @xmath12 accounts for the regeneration of initially well localized wave packets during their time evolution .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 shows the spreading ( high nonclassicality values ) and the resuming of the classical periodic motion ( low nonclassicality values ) of wave packets in two example cases , namely , the quantum bouncer and the infinite square - well .",
    "this approach overcome the generic difficulty that the autocorrelation function misses to detect some fractional revivals because the mini - packets emerge at arbitrary positions that do not coincide with the original one .",
    "this appears to be a common advantage of all the entropy - based approaches .",
