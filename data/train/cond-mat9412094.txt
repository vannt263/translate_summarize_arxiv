    "in a seminal paper , haldane showed that integer spin chains display a gap in the spectrum , where as half - integer spin chains are gapless  @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed both by experiments  @xcite and numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "currently , the best estimates of the gap for the isotropic @xmath0 chain are @xmath7 , using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite , and @xmath8 using exact diagonalization  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical structure factor has also been determined in great detail , by numerical studies of finite systems  @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental effort has in recent years focused on ni(c@xmath5h@xmath9n@xmath5)@xmath5no@xmath5(clo@xmath10 ) ( nenp ) which show clear evidence of the haldane gap  @xcite .",
    "nenp has not been observed to undergo a three - dimensional ordering at any accessible temperature as opposed to csnicl@xmath11 which yielded the first experimental confirmation of the haldane gap  @xcite .",
    "nenp has a fairly large single ion anisotropy estimated to be @xmath12  @xcite where as csnicl@xmath11 is almost isotropic .",
    "recently , experiments have been performed on y@xmath5banio@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this charge - transfer insulator has long one - dimensional chains of ni atoms at the center of compressed corner sharing oxygen octahedra .",
    "thus , along the chains , the ni@xmath13 ions , with @xmath0 , are separated by nonmagnetic o@xmath14 ions .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange interaction between the ni@xmath13 ions is then mediated through the oxygen sites .",
    "y@xmath5banio@xmath6 has a fairly large exchange coupling of @xmath15=285k  @xcite-322k  @xcite , estimated from high temperature susceptibility measurements . from inelastic neutron scattering experiments on powders",
    "@xcite it is known that the inter chain coupling is small , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the compound is highly one - dimensional and no three - dimensional ordering has been seen . in powder",
    "averaged inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite two gaps have been observed ; for fluctuations parallel to the chain , @xmath17 , and for fluctuations perpendicular to the chain , @xmath18 .",
    "this is in good agreement with single crystal measurements of @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the two gaps are explained in terms of a single ion anisotropy @xmath20  @xcite , a value close to what is found for nenp .",
    "the one - dimensional haldane gap systems are by now fairly well understood .",
    "however , the important effect of impurities on these systems have only recently been considered .",
    "y@xmath5banio@xmath6 offers several possibilities for doping and is thus well suited for such studies .",
    "non - magnetic zn@xmath13 ions can be substituted for ni@xmath13 , thus effectively severing the ni chains .",
    "experiments have been performed on zn doped samples , y@xmath5bani@xmath21zn@xmath22o@xmath6  @xcite , confirming the picture of chain cutting , with a possibility for an _ increase _ in the gap with doping  @xcite due to the fact that the average length of the chain segments is small enough for finite - size effects to be observable .",
    "severing of the chains is predicted to have rather dramatic effects on the low energy excitations .",
    "it can be shown that the af heisenberg model is fairly well approximated by a valence bond solid ( vbs ) model  @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the valence bonds by the introduction of impurities should produce free @xmath3 spins at the sites next to the impurity .",
    "the effect of such free @xmath3 at the chain - ends has been observed in electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) experiments on nenp by doping with cu  @xcite , thereby introducing a @xmath3 at the impurity site , and by doping with non - magnetic zn , cd and hg  @xcite .",
    "these findings have recently been contrasted by specific heat measurements  @xcite on y@xmath5bani@xmath21zn@xmath22o@xmath6 which show a schottky anomaly consistent with free @xmath0 .    another possibility for doping exists in y@xmath5banio@xmath6 .",
    "carriers , in the form of holes , can be added to the system by replacing the _ off - chain _",
    "y@xmath23 with ca@xmath13 . ditusa et .",
    "al  @xcite show , from polarized x - ray absorption spectra , that the added holes are localized on the oxygen _ between _ the ni atoms .",
    "the addition of a hole on the oxygen sites could effectively turn these into @xmath3 spins , if strongly localized .",
    "ca doping should then have significant effects on the spectrum .",
    "powder averaged inelastic neutron scattering have been performed on y@xmath24ca@xmath22banio@xmath6  @xcite showing that ca doping produces states in the haldane gap . from analysis of the spectral weight per impurity , ditusa et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the magnetic disturbance caused by the ca doping introduces either a triplet or a quartet of subgap bound states .    in order to address the experimental results on doped @xmath0 spin chains",
    "we therefore consider the simple model hamiltonian @xmath25 here the single ion anisotropy is neglected for simplicity , and * s * represents @xmath0 spins .",
    "the impurity hamiltonian @xmath26 is taken to be either a perturbed bond @xmath27 or a @xmath3 impurity , in which case we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath3 impurity spin .",
    "schematically the two kinds of impurities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chains]a ,  [ fig : chains]b , respectively . for the carrier doped compounds",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) may not be a good description and a hubbard like model may be more appropriate .",
    "however , in themselves the hamiltonians , eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) , deserves attention and they should form a good starting point also for the carrier doped compounds if the carriers are strongly localized .    our approach is to study the low - lying excitations in these systems by comparing large - scale numerical results , obtained using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , to perturbative results , valid at strong or large coupling , based on effective @xmath3 chain - end excitations generated by broken valence bonds . in section  [ sec : methods ] we discuss the numerical approach .",
    "section  [ sec : bonds ] addresses the effects of a single perturbed bond at the center of a chain , while we in section  [ shalf ] present our results for a @xmath3 impurity .",
    "the bulk of our results concerns antiferromagnetically coupled impurities , however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ferro.coupling ] we briefly discuss scenarios for ferromagnetically coupled impurities .",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method proposed by white  @xcite . for a detailed discussion of the dmrg method",
    "we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "in all our runs we truncate each half - space to @xmath30 states , and we work in a subspace defined by the total z - component of the magnetization , @xmath31 , and by the parity with respect to reflection around the central bond , or central spin , for even and odd length chains , respectively . for the dmrg method",
    "we therefore denote the different states by @xmath32 .",
    "note that , this is the z - component of the spin and _ not _ the total spin of the state .",
    "the idea behind the dmrg method revolves around the notion of a subsystem , in this case half of the chain , that is strongly coupled to the universe , here the complete chain . as usual in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the subsystem is then best described by its density matrix , whose eigenvalues give the probability for the subsystem to be in a given eigenstate ( of the subsystem density matrix ) , under the constraint that the universe ( the complete chain ) is in a given pure state .",
    "here we mean , by pure state , an eigenstate of the hamiltonian for the complete system .",
    "it is now clear that if we start to effectively decouple the subsystem from the universe , by changing the relevant coupling at the center of the chain , the standard dmrg method , where the system is split in half at the impurity site , will become progressively inaccurate .",
    "this can be seen in the limit where the coupling to the universe , i. e. the central bond in the chain , is zero , in which case the eigenstates of the density matrix and the hamiltonian for the subsystem are the same and the dmrg method reduces to standard real space renormalization which is not comparable to the strongly coupled dmrg in precision . we therefore expect to have problems whenever the perturbations that we consider at the center of the chain behave in a way that effectively breaks the system in two . however , as we shall see , this still leaves a workable region where we can obtain useful results .",
    "we assume that these difficulties could be overcome by considering more complicated dmrg schemes where the system is not split at the impurity site .",
    "however , most other schemes will reduce the symmetry of the problem and we therefore prefer to work with the standard method .",
    "in the case where the ni based @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets are doped by impurities that form divalent non - magnetic ions , such as zn , cd , and hg , we expect the impurities to effectively cut the ni chains . in the valence bond picture  @xcite",
    "this leads to free @xmath3 at the neighboring sites . in this section",
    "we consider the more general case where the central bond in an open chain is different from the rest of the chain , although still antiferromagnetic .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : himpa ] ) . for the experiments performed with non - magnetic impurities",
    "the relevant situation is that of an extremely weak bond .",
    "this can be seen in the experiments of glarum et al .",
    "@xcite who interpret their results in terms of _ free _ @xmath3 chain - end spins .",
    "if the bond at the center of the chain is weak enough we can view the problem as two weakly coupled open chains of half the length . at the end of an open @xmath0 chain",
    "we expect to find an effective @xmath3 excitation , this we shall refer to as a chain - end spin .",
    "thus , for sufficiently long chains , the low - lying excitations can be described by an effective hamiltonian of two weakly coupled chain - end spins .",
    "this should be valid once the coupling of the chain - end spins across the impurity bond is larger than the coupling _ along _ the chain segment .",
    "the latter is known to decrease exponential with the length of the chain segment  @xcite , and should thus quickly become negligible .",
    "experimentally this is the relevant situation for nenp , since it is difficult to obtain high zn doping levels  @xcite , and the average chain segment is therefore likely to be long .",
    "y@xmath5banio@xmath6 offer the possibility of higher doping levels .",
    "if we denote by @xmath33 the projection onto the @xmath3 subspace , we can write @xmath34 . we need to determine @xmath35 .",
    "fortunately , an estimate can easily be obtained by looking at the expectation value one of the spins at the _ end _ of a _",
    "free _ chain .",
    "if we by @xmath36 denote the state that has both the chain - end spins polarized in the  up \"- state we find @xmath37 previous work  @xcite have established that @xmath38 at the end of a free chain , and thus @xmath39 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a @xmath3 spin .",
    "we then immediately see that the low energy spectrum will be given by a ground - state singlet and a higher lying triplet , the splitting between the two given by @xmath42 this corresponds to a bound state in the haldane gap , @xmath43 . for the isotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg model that we are studying here we have @xmath44 in the absence of any impurities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapj.1 ] we show the energy gap between the two lowest lying states for a chain that has a weak bond of @xmath45 in the middle of an otherwise isotropic chain .",
    "since we have two essentially free @xmath3 chain - end spins at each end of the open chain , the ground - state becomes four - fold degenerate . for finite chain lengths we expect these two chain - end spins to combine into a ground - state singlet , @xmath46 , with an exponentially low - lying triplet , @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit the triplet and the singlet become degenerate .",
    "thus , if we want to calculate the spectrum caused by the impurity we need to look at higher excited states . the resulting gap , which remain finite in the thermodynamic limit , can be calculated between the @xmath48 and @xmath47 states , where we for computational convenience take the @xmath47 state to represent the ground - state since they become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapj.1 ] , the gap converges quickly to a value of @xmath49 . with @xmath50",
    "we find that eq .",
    "( [ eq : deweak ] ) gives @xmath51 in excellent agreement .",
    "the good agreement between the perturbative results and the dmrg results lends further support to the picture of effective @xmath3 chain - end spins .",
    "the dmrg method is convenient for studying correlations in real - space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : szj.1 ] we show the expectation value of the z - component of the spin along a 100 site chain for @xmath50 . in the @xmath48 state",
    "we have effectively polarized all four @xmath3 chain - end spins at sites 1 , 50 , 51 , and 100 in the  up \" direction . in order to focus attention on the effects of the impurity",
    "we have subtracted off @xmath52 . in the @xmath47 state",
    "the chain - end spins at site 50 , 51 are combined into a singlet , by subtracting off @xmath52 we therefore cancel out the effect of the chain - end spins at site 1 and 100 .",
    "one sees that the two chain - end spins surrounding the perturbed bond have effectively formed a localized state .    using the dmrg method we can now map out the energy of this bound state as a function of the weak coupling , @xmath2 . due to the problems mentioned in section  [ sec : methods ] it is not possible to treat values of @xmath2 below @xmath53 within the standard dmrg",
    "however , since the impurity state is localized , the convergence to the thermodynamic limit is very fast as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapj.1 ] .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weakgap ] .",
    "the filled squares are the numerical results , the solid line the haldane gap for the isotropic chain , @xmath54 , and the dashed line indicates the result from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deweak ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : weakgap ] it is seen that only for @xmath55 does a bound state below the isotropic haldane gap exist .",
    "around @xmath56 the bound state seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : szj.1 ] delocalizes and spreads out over the entire chain .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : szj.7 ] where we plot @xmath57 as a function of chain index @xmath58 for a 100 site chain with @xmath56 .",
    "clearly this state is not localized and it resembles what one finds for the isotropic chain  @xcite . we therefore conclude that it is necessary to weaken the central bond below a critical value @xmath59 in order to create a bound state .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the opposite limit where the central bond is very strong , @xmath60 . for the antiferromagnetic coupling that we consider here",
    ", the two neighboring spins will be contracted into a singlet . in the limit @xmath61",
    "the chain will be severed as was the case for a weak bond .",
    "we now want to derive an effective hamiltonian valid for @xmath60 . as a starting point",
    "it is convenient to consider the case where we only have four spins described by the hamiltonian : @xmath62 we do perturbation theory in @xmath63 .",
    "note that when @xmath64 there is a degneracy since the spins , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be in arbitrary states .",
    "this is lifted in second order perturbation theory in @xmath67 .",
    "the result of second order perturbation theory can be expressed in terms of an effective hamiltonian acting on the low - energy subspace , in which @xmath68 and @xmath69 are projected onto the singlet state : @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 projects onto the singlet ground - state of @xmath73 , with energy @xmath74 .",

    "( [ eq : heff.strong ] ) .",
    "as was the case for a weak bond we find a critical coupling , @xmath94 , but now with an approximate value of @xmath95 above which no bound state occurs .",
    "the picture of a quenched singlet in the middle of the chain weakly coupled to two chain - end spins on either side , can be substantiated by calculating the expectation value of the z - component of the spin along the chain .",

    "[ fig : szj.1 ] . at the point where the bound state disappear",
    "we again find that the expectation value @xmath57 spreads out over the entire chain .",
    "we may think of a magnon as behaving , in many respects , like an ordinary particle of mass @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the spin - wave velocity .",
    "thus it may , at first , seem surprising that no bound state exists for a weak perturbation of the coupling , @xmath103 since there is a well - known theorem of one - dimensional quantum mechanics which states that an attractive potential always produces a bound state , no matter how weak it is  @xcite .",
    "our result is not surprising if one looks in a bit more detail at the mapping of the spin problem into an effective one - particle quantum mechanics problem .",
    "we represent the spin operators at long length - scales in terms of the non - linear @xmath104 ( nl@xmath104 ) model field , @xmath105 ( obeying the constraint @xmath106 ) and the associated canonical momentum , @xmath107 , as : @xmath108 the hamiltonian density becomes : @xmath109 acting on the vacuum , @xmath105 creates the triplet of single - magnon states .",
    "a local perturbation in the exchange couplings leads to additional local terms in the field theory hamiltonian density of the form : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are some short - range functions . note that we _ do not _ get simply @xmath113 , since this term is trivial due to the constraint , @xmath114 .",

    "this gives the dispersion relation : @xmath117 ( we have shifted the wave - vector by @xmath118 . )",
    "we may easily treat the additional impurity term , @xmath119 .",
    "this gives the schrdinger equation : @xmath120 ' = me\\psi .\\ ] ] we obtain this equation for each of the three magnon polarizations .",
    "note that this _ does not _ correspond to a standard potential scattering term .",
    "we could obtain a potential scattering term from a term in the nl@xmath104 model hamiltonian of the form @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "however , these terms break the @xmath123 symmetry and therefore ca nt appear in the heisenberg model .",
    "the latter term corresponds to a local magnetic field .",
    "the former could arise if we have a crystal field term in addition to the heisenberg exchange .",
    "the peculiar derivative potential term does not necessarily lead to a bound state if it is weak . to demonstrate this we consider the case of a step function : @xmath124 solutions to the schrdinger equation will have discontinuous @xmath125 at @xmath126 . defining @xmath127 to be the limit of @xmath128 as @xmath129 from above or below respectively and similarly for @xmath130",

    "the binding energy is determined by : @xmath142 this has a solution for all @xmath140 . as @xmath143 , we get : @xmath144    this provides a counter - example to the statement that there is always a bound state for a weak derivative potential term . on the other hand , there is a rigorous proof of the fact ( see , for example ref . ) for an ordinary potential term .",
    "this argument is admittedly quite incomplete since we havent analyzed the other , @xmath145 term , nor dealt carefully with the passage from the nl@xmath104 model to the free model .",

    "our findings in this section are in disagreement with a recent schwinger - boson calculation  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of @xmath3 impurities in a @xmath0 af heisenberg chain . experimentally two scenarios have been studied .",

    "@xcite argue that the holes become localized on the o sites between the ni ions .",
    "here the situation is different since the introduced @xmath3 impurity does _ not _ take the place of a @xmath0 , instead , it is placed _ between _ two ni ions .",
    "thus , the superexchange between the two ni ions is broken and presumably replaced by a _ direct _ exchange to the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , which is likely to be large compared to @xmath67 .",
