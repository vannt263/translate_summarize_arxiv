    "the @xmath0pictoris  disk is an evolved replenished circumstellar disk around a main sequence star , and appears to be a planetary ( or cometary ) disk ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "in addition to the dust disk , gas has been probed through absorption lines on the star line of sight ( lagrange et al .",
    "1998 ) . the observations of this gas component historically gave the most unexpected and important results with the detection of what appears to be the first extra - solar comets ever observed ( ferlet et al .",
    "1987 , vidal - madjar et al . 1998 ) . however , non - radial motions are still unknown because observations are limited to the gaseous absorption lines on the star line of sight . here",
    "we present the results of exploratory hst observations aimed to observe the emission lines of ions in the disk with the spectrograph slit off the star .",
    "[ data ]    the observations were made on february 9 , 1996 with the hst / ghrs using the ssa slit ( 0.22@xmath60.22 ) and echelle spectroscopy at an expected resolution of 80  000 to get the highest chance of detection of lines with _ a priori _ unknown width .",
    "after a peak - up on the star @xmath0pictorisand the acquisition of reference spectra , the telescope was shifted to the south - west part of the @xmath0pictoris  disk at a position angle of 31.5 degrees to a distance of 0.5 and 1.5  from the star . the log of the observations is summarized in table  [ log ] .",
    "the candidate lines are those from ions for which strong absorptions have been seen in the stable component due to the gas disk and in the variable components due to the infalling comets . on this basis",
    ", we expected the strongest fluorescence .",
    ".log of the observations performed on feb .",
    "9@xmath7 1996 .",
    "@xmath8 is the distance from @xmath0pictoris [ cols=\"^,^,^ , < , < , < \" , ]      [ si spectrum at 0.5 ]    the spectra observed on the disk present the same general shape as the spectra on the star but with a lower intensity level .",
    "indeed , any spectrum of the disk obtained off the star ( @xmath9 ) is an addition of a `` noise '' component and a spectrum carrying information from the disk at the pointed position .",
    "the `` noise '' is the spectrum of the starlight scattered by the telescope ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the star spectrum ) plus a background level ( @xmath12 ) due to the fact that the background determined by the hst pipeline can be slightly miscalculated .",
    "the part of the spectrum due to the disk ( @xmath13 ) is the starlight scattered by the dust and the possible emission lines due to gaseous fluorescence .",
    "we thus consider that the additional noisy component ( @xmath14 ) is a linear combination of the stellar spectra ( @xmath11 ) obtained at the same wavelength a few orbits before : @xmath15 to put forward the potential presence of a component different from the dominant starlight scattered by the telescope , we divide the observed spectra by the stellar spectra . the presence of a disk contribution at a wavelength @xmath16 will be detected if the ratio @xmath17 is statistically significantly different from 1 .",
    "the main problem is thus the determination of @xmath18 and @xmath12 , and their errorbars within a confidence level . assuming that the disk spectra ( dust scattered light plus gas emission lines ) have a negligible contribution to the observed spectra ( @xmath19 )",
    ", we can determine @xmath18 and @xmath12 by a @xmath20 minimization of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the weight of each measurement at @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure gives not only the best determination of @xmath18 and @xmath12 but also intervals of confidence for these constants .",
    "spectra in the  wavelength range were obtained less than 10 minutes apart with the same instrument setting .",
    "the star and the disk spectra can be easily superimposed as shown in fig .",
    "[ plot_feii ] .",
    "an excess of flux clearly appears in the blue _ and _ the red part of the two strongest  lines at rest wavelength 2374.461    and 2382.765   .",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath12 are determined as described in sect  [ method ] , we get @xmath24 and @xmath25  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath3 . with these parameters , a plot of the ratio of the disk to the star spectra reveals an excess emission at 2@xmath26 level ( fig .  [ ratio_feii ] ) .",
    "the flux from the disk can be evaluated by the difference between the two spectra ( @xmath27 ) , and is @xmath28  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath3  between 50 and 150 kms@xmath3  in the red part of the lines and around @xmath2950  kms@xmath3  in the blue part ( fig .",
    "[ vel_feii ] ) .",
    "this emission is about 1    wide and stronger in the red part of the lines .",
    "the detection of apparent excess emission in the two  lines can be explained in different ways .",
    "we propose that this can be a real detection of the emission through the scattering of the starlight by the  ions in very high velocity motions .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "however other possibilities must be evaluated .",
    "first , this feature obviously can not be simply due to a possible miscalculation ( underestimate ) of @xmath12 , the background correction .",
    "indeed , by underestimating @xmath12 , we could find false emission - like features at wavelength where the flux is low .",
    "but , one should increase the estimate of @xmath12 above its 4@xmath26 upper limit ( @xmath30  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath3 ) to explain the detected emission feature only by this effect .",
    "in addition , the emission is detected in both  lines , in particular in the  line at 2374.461    where the level is far above the zero level , and for which an error on the estimate of @xmath12 has almost no effect on the result .",
    "in fact , @xmath12 is well - determined by the very bottom of the strongest  lines where the level is clearly less than @xmath31  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath3  ( fig .",
    "[ plot_feii ] ) .",
    "however , apparent emissions due to the addition of the statistical noise and a bad estimate of the background level might be possible .",
    "but , although not excluded , it is very unlikely that this coincidence can contribute to give apparent emissions in the two sides of the two strongest  lines .",
    "the most important alternative to emission by  is a time variation of the @xmath0pictoris  spectrum between the observations of the template ( the star ) and the disk spectra .",
    "if the absorption component in the  lines had significantly decreased during the acquisition of the data , then the result is an apparent excess of emission in the second spectrum obtained with the slit off the star .",
    "although the time between both spectra has been minimized , this possibility can not be excluded without new observations , for example on the other side of the disk where the emission should be stronger in the blue .",
    "if this detection is really due to emission by  ions , the lines width must be explained through the dynamics of these  ions in the disk .",
    "the  ions must be ejected from the @xmath0pictoris  system by the radiation pressure which is stronger than the gravitation by a factor @xmath32 ( lagrange et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "after ejection , they rapidly reach a constant asymptotic velocity @xmath33 . if they are ejected from a body on a circular orbit , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the radius of the orbit of the parent body .",
    "if they are ejected from a comet on a parabolic orbit , the final velocity is @xmath36 . in this simple scheme , the observed final velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ vel_feii ] ) corresponds to a production at about 1.5  au from the star , or similarly to the absence of gas drag beyond that distance .",
    "the emission lines are stronger in the red than in the blue .",
    "this is similar to the asymmetry already observed in the cometary absorption lines which are mainly redshifted ( beust et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this last asymmetry is well - explained by the evaporation of comets with a small range of longitude of periastron ( beust et al .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed asymmetry in the emission lines could be an extended shape for the dragging torus of gas needed to support the radiation pressure on the  and  ions observed at zero radial velocity in the stable gaseous disk ( lagrange et al .",
    "1998 , beust et al . 1998 ) . for both explanations ,",
    "it is clear that the observed south - west branch of the disk must be the `` red side '' of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "this provides an observational test : the north - east branch must present a larger emission in the blue lines .",
    "the total brightness of  emission lines can be evaluated to be : @xmath37 in @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the solid angle covered by the spectrograph slit .",
    "the ssa slit ( 0.22x0.22 ) gives @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is the distance to @xmath0pictoris  ( @xmath42  pc@xmath43 cm ) .",
    "@xmath44 is the frequency integral of the cross section .",
    "@xmath45 is the brightness per unit of frequency of @xmath0pictoris  seen from the earth at the relevant wavelength .",
    "@xmath46 is the density of the observed ion at a distance @xmath8 from the central star .",
    "@xmath47 is the differential length along the line of sight .",
    "we can define a weighted integral equivalent to the column density by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the impact parameter of the line of sight ( @xmath50  au ) . for the  2382   line ,",
    "@xmath51  @xmath52  s@xmath3 and the observed emission is @xmath53 finally , we have @xmath54 @xmath55 this value is consistent with the  column density ( @xmath56  @xmath2 ) and the hypothesis that  should be gathered in the dragging torus around 1  au and that they have an @xmath57 distribution beyond this torus ( lagrange et al .",
    "1998 ) . to evaluate the  volume density , @xmath58 , at @xmath49",
    ", we can define the dimensionless quantity @xmath59 by @xmath60 then , @xmath61 if we make the assumption that @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , ... , @xmath66 , _",
    "et cetera_. @xmath67 would correspond to gas expelled by radiation pressure . for reasonable value of @xmath68 , within a factor of 2 , @xmath69 . as a final result ,",
    "we get @xmath70    the calculation has been done with the hypothesis of an optically thin line .",
    "we also assume that the filling factor in the vertical direction is  1 , thus the obtained density @xmath58 is in fact a lower limit . the other  line at 2374    has an oscillator strength 10  times smaller but the stellar flux is larger at this wavelength ( @xmath71  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath3  @xmath3 ) .",
    "it gives about the same value of density within a factor of  2 .",
    "the corresponding  production rate can be roughly estimated by the flux of material ( @xmath72  km  s@xmath3 ) through the area observed at 10  au with high @xmath73  au : @xmath74  kg  s@xmath3 . with solar abundances , this corresponds to the total disruption of about 10  asteroids per year with a radius of 30  km .",
    "to confirm the tentative detection presented in this paper , new observations are really needed .",
    "the first obvious method will be to observe the other ( north - east ) side of the disk which should present the same feature except blueshifted instead of redshifted .",
    "we can also observe other lines which should present the same characteristics .",
    "the  lines at 2600    and  lines at 2800    are well - suited candidates .",
    "the  line at 2050    with an intermediate @xmath75 is also an interesting target ( lagrange et al .",
    "stis , with long - slit capability is technically better suited to this observation .",
    "hst observations planned to detect the emission lines of ions in the @xmath0pictoris  disk with the spectrograph slit placed off the star gave a marginal detection of possible emission lines from  ions at 0.5  from @xmath0pictoris .",
    "this would suggest an  density of @xmath76@xmath5 at 10  au .    if real , this indicates a large production rate of gas and dust equivalent to the total disruption of 10 bodies of 30 kilometers in radius per year .",
    "this corresponds to a production rate of about @xmath77m@xmath78 per year .",
