    "with the development of advanced experimental technology , more and more particle diffusion process in a complex system are revealed to follow anonymous diffusion instead of the traditional gaussian statistics .",

    "in particular , subdiffusion process ( @xmath1 ) has been a focal point in both physics and mathematics by virtue of its internal nature of connection with fractional differential equations ( fdes ) .",
    "this class of process has either infinite mean of waiting time or diverging jump length variance ( lvy flights ) . as a result ,",
    "continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , rather than brownian motion , seems to be more competitive to model the anonymous sub - diffusion of particles in a complex system and this fact has been adopted in many applications such as underground environment problem @xcite , fluid flow @xcite , and turbulence and chaos @xcite . regarding to probability density function , the ctrw with diverging mean of waiting time results in a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) of fractional derivative in time whereas lvy flights leads to a fpe of spatial fractional derivative @xcite .",

    ", the petrov - galerkin method has a remarkable edge over the galerkin method on the choice of test space to enhance computational efficiency while preserving its convergence order .",
    "a general framework of the petrov - galerkin method for second type integral equation has been established in @xcite . by a careful selection of these two spaces ,",
    "karniadakis et al @xcite obtained an explicit expression of their approximation ( without solving a linear system ) for certain riemann - liouville fdes . for substantial fdes , our work seems to be the first attempt by this method .",

    "compared to the extensive numerical methods developed for standard fde , the effort on developing numerical schemes for substantial fde is limited accounting for its relatively new appearance in the field . as far as we know , numerical methods for substantial fde are prominently finite difference methods ( fdm ) , see @xcite for first order accuracy fdm and particle tracking methods . in @xcite , a comparison study of numerical solutions of three fractional partial differential equations falling in the class of lvy models with substantial fractional derivative",

    "\\(4 ) to the best of our knowledge , this work is the first attempt to solve a substantial fde on a semi - infinite domain without a domain truncation so far .",
    "we point out that for standard riemann - liouville fde , petrov - galerkin methods and a spectral collocation method have been proposed in @xcite",
