    "transport of particles driven by external forces across modulated potential surfaces , and the associated ability to sort mixtures of particles according to some feature sensitive to this modulation , has attracted considerable recent interest  @xcite .",
    "the surface modulation may be periodic or random , and it may consist of traps , obstacles , or a combination of both .",
    "typical sorting parameters include particle size , particle index of refraction , and particle mass .",
    "the underlying mechanism in all cases relies on the fact that while the particles attempt to follow the external force , the traps or obstacles induce systematic deviations in the trajectories so that there is a non - zero average angle between the trajectory and the external force .",
    "if this non - zero angle depends on some characteristic of the particle such as size , then particles that differ in this characteristic emerge at different angles and can therefore be sorted in a very effective way .",
    "there are a number of experimental demonstrations of these capabilities  @xcite , and there are also fairly extensive numerical simulations of various model formulations  @xcite that are quite successful in explaining the experimental phenomena .",
    "these simulations to some extent clarify the roles of a number of physical variables such as , for example , the direction of the external force , surface geometry , and ambient temperature , that affect the experimental outcomes . on the other hand ,",
    "analytic results are relatively rare  @xcite , and yet it is undoubtedly useful to have predictive analytic formulas , especially with a view to optimizing the sorting mechanism . in this paper",
    "we take a step in this direction , deriving approximate results that are shown to reproduce some of the important earlier numerical results .",
    "while our results are limited to certain parameter regimes , we believe that they may prove useful in designing experimental sorting potentials and in identifying likely regions of parameter space for more detailed numerical study .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the model and define the quantities to be calculated , specifically , the angle between the average velocity of the particles and the external force . in our discussions",
    "we include periodic potentials as well as random potentials . in sec .",
    "[ approximate ] ( accompanied by an appendix ) we present approximate equations for the average velocity valid for sufficiently strong forces and/or high temperatures , and discuss how these approximations might be continued to further orders than those retained here . in sec .",

    "the long - time limit of this velocity is denoted by @xmath11 , and is decomposed into cartesian components as @xmath12 the angle brackets denote averaging over the thermal noise . if the potential @xmath0 is random , then we also perform an average over realizations of the potential , denoting such an ensemble average by an overbar : @xmath13 . to calculate the average velocity for a periodic potential",

    "should be replaced by its average over the disorder : @xmath23 , @xmath24 etc . ) .",
    "we will explore the behavior of this angle through that of each component @xmath22 and @xmath25 of the average velocity , and examine the accuracy of our approximations in capturing these behaviors .",
    "to avoid overly complicated formulas , we adopt the convention throughout the remainder of this paper ( except in the appendix ) that the notation @xmath26 ( or its components @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) stands for the averaged quantity @xmath11 ( or , respectively , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",

    "averages of all other quantities will be denoted explicitly using angle brackets and overbars as appropriate .",
    "the experimentally interesting regimes involve an external force of magnitude sufficiently larger than the well depth ( @xmath35 ) so that particles do not easily become trapped .",
    "if a particle did become trapped , it would have to be extracted by a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation to continue moving across the surface .",
    "the particles of interest in a sorting context are those that do not become trapped during the course of the experiment . on the other hand , if the force is too large , it simply drags the particles along , the features of the potential become essentially invisible , and particle separation , which relies on the effect of the potential on the particle trajectories , does not occur . at the same time",
    ", the temperature of the system should not be so high as to obliterate the features of the potential .",
    "a temperature that is too high would again lead to an uninteresting situation in that particle separation would again not be observed .",
    "the regime of interest is thus that of an external force that is large but not too large , and a temperature that is as low as possible in theory and in practice .      in the appendix",
    "we show how a systematic large force and/or high temperature approximation may be obtained .",
    "the first - order approximation leads to the average velocity vector @xmath36 where for periodic potentials the function @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the fourier transform of the potential @xmath41 as defined in eq .",

    "the equation of motion is @xmath42 we call the forcing @xmath43 instead of @xmath7 because for the simplest separable potential in two dimensions we will be able to identify the average speed @xmath44 with the components of the two - dimensional velocity via the relations @xmath45 and @xmath46 , thus providing a way to determine the deflection angle in a two - dimensional case via a one - dimensional calculation .",
    "the result is @xmath47 a number of points are noteworthy .",
    "firstly , a simple sinusoidal potential has minima ( which we think of as traps ) as well as maxima ( which we think of as barriers ) relative to a flat landscape  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we observe that the net effect of the potential in one dimension is to slow down the particles .",
    "thirdly , when the associations @xmath45 and @xmath46 are appropriate , we can immediately see that the deflection @xmath48 is associated with the fact that the  slowing down \" is different for each component for most angles @xmath49 .",
    "the technique yielding the approximate formula ( [ formula ] ) in the case of a periodic potential may readily be extended to random potentials , as simulated numerically in  @xcite , for instance .",
    "indeed , the method of deriving eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) was originally developed for the calculation of particle concentrations when advected by potentials which are random in space  @xcite and also in time  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of sorting on random potentials can thus be examined using analytic approximations .      the appropriate kernel in formula ( [ formula ] ) for a random potential is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the `` energy spectrum '' of the potential .",
    "the energy spectrum is defined as the fourier transform of the ( disorder - averaged ) correlation function of the potential @xmath52 .",
    "the disorder is assumed to be homogeneous , so that the correlation function depends only on the difference vector @xmath53 ; recall that the overbar denotes averaging over the ensemble of random potentials .",

    "we conclude that for isotropic random potentials the deflection angle is zero .",
    "this means that sorting by deflection angle is not possible in isotropic random potentials .",
    "it is useful to explore the behavior and magnitude of the second and higher order approximations for the velocity .",

    "here we simply point out that for @xmath69 the full infinite series sums to the known exact solution  @xcite @xmath70 .    in the case of a one - dimensional random potential ,",

    "we end this section by repeating our earlier assertion that the perturbation theory becomes more accurate with increasing temperature .",
    "in fact , the series expansion developed in the appendix is a perturbation series about the limit of infinite forcing , and non - zero temperature acts to regularize this series at finite forcing .",
    "the accuracy of truncations of the series thus improves with increasing force and with increasing temperature .",
    "although the sorting capability of the system decreases with increasing temperature ( and with increasing force ) , it is useful to display some higher temperature results explicitly .",

    "in summary , we have derived approximate analytic or quadrature forms for the average velocity of particles moving in a periodic potential or random potential .",
    "the average velocity in general deviates from that of the applied constant external force , the deviation depending on some particle characteristic such as size .",
    "this can then be used to sort particles that differ in this characteristic . a systematic perturbation series valid for large external forces and/or high temperatures",

    "the results are not nearly as good when the force lies near one of the crystal axes , because the truncated perturbation series can then lead to unphysical negative velocity components .",
