    "cellular population models have been investigated intensively since the 1960 s ( see , for example , trucco @xcite , nooney @xcite , rubinow @xcite and rubinow and lebowitz @xcite ) and still interest a lot of researchers .",
    "this interest is greatly motivated , on one hand , by the medical applications and , on the other hand , by the biological phenomena ( such as oscillations , bifurcations , traveling waves or chaos ) observed in these models and , generally speaking , in the living world ( mackey and glass @xcite , mackey and milton @xcite ) .",
    "hematopoiesis is the process by which primitive stem cells proliferate and differentiate to produce mature blood cells .",
    "it is driven by highly coordinated patterns of gene expression under the influence of growth factors and hormones .",
    "the regulation of hematopoiesis is about the formation of blood cell elements in the body .",
    "white and red blood cells and platelets are produced in the bone marrow from where they enter the blood stream .",
    "the principal factor stimulating red blood cell production is the hormone produced in the kidney , called erythropoietin . about @xmath2 of the erythropoietin",
    "is secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells when blood is unable to deliver sufficient oxygen .",
    "when the level of oxygen in the blood decreases this leads to a release of a substance , which in turn causes an increase in the release of the blood elements from the marrow .",
    "there is a feedback from the blood to the bone marrow .",
    "abnormalities in the feedback are considered as major suspects in causing periodic hematological diseases , such as auto - immune hemolytic anemia ( blair _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and mahaffy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , cyclical neutropenia ( haurie _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( fowler and mackey @xcite and pujo - menjouet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , etc .",
    "cell biologists classified stem cells as proliferating cells and resting cells ( also called @xmath3-cells ) ( see mackey @xcite ) .",
    "proliferating cells are committed to undergo mitosis a certain time after their entrance into the proliferating phase .",
    "mackey supposed that this time of cytokinesis is constant , that is , it is the same for all cells .",
    "most of committed stem cells are in the proliferating phase .",
    "the @xmath3-phase , whose existence is known due to the works of burns and tannock @xcite , is a quiescent stage in the cellular development .",
    "however , it is usually believed that 95% of pluripotent stem cells are in the resting phase .",
    "resting cells can exit randomly to either entry into the proliferating phase or be irremediably lost .",
    "proliferating cells can also be lost by apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) .",
    "the model of mackey @xcite has been numerically studied by mackey and rey @xcite and crabb _ et al .",
    "computer simulations showed that there exist strange behaviors of the stem cell population , such as oscillations and bifurcations .",
    "recently , pujo - menjouet and mackey @xcite proved the existence of a hopf bifurcation which causes periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia and showed the great dependence of the model on the parameters .    in this paper , based on the model of mackey @xcite , we propose a more general model of hematopoiesis .",
    "we take into account the fact that a cell cycle has two phases , that is , stem cells in process are either in a resting phase or actively proliferating .",
    "however , we do not suppose that all cells divide at the same age , because this hypothesis is not biologically reasonable .",
    "for example , it is believed that pluripotent stem cells divide faster than committed stem cells , which are more mature cells .",
    "there are strong evidences ( see bradford _",
    "@xcite ) that indicate that the age of cytokinesis @xmath4 is distributed on an interval @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we shall assume that @xmath4 is distributed with a density @xmath7 supported on an interval @xmath8 $ ] , with @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting model is a system of two differential equations with distributed delay .",
    "a simpler model , dealing with the pluripotent stem cell population behavior , has been studied by adimy _",
    "_ @xcite .    some results about stability of differential equations with distributed delay can be mentioned . in @xcite ,",
    "boese studied the stability of a differential equation with gamma - distributed delay .",
    "gamma distributions have the property to simplify the nature of the delay and this situation is close to the one with discrete delay .",
    "anderson @xcite showed stability results linked to the different moments ( especially the expectation and the variance ) of the distribution .",
    "kuang @xcite also obtained general stability results for systems of delay differential equations .",
    "more recently , sufficient conditions for the stability of delay differential equations with distributed delay have been obtained by bernard _",
    "they used some properties of the distribution to prove these results .",
    "however , in all these works , the authors focused on sufficient conditions for the stability , there is no necessary condition in these studies , and these results are not applicable directly to the model considered in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sectionpresentation ] , we present the model and establish boundedness properties of the solutions . in section [ sectionstability ] , we study the asymptotic stability of the equilibria .",
    "we give conditions for the trivial equilibrium to be globally asymptotically stable in section [ sectiontrivialequilibrium ] and investigate the stability of the nontrivial equilibrium in section [ sectionotherequilibrium ] . in section [ sectionhopfbifurcation ] , we show that a local hopf bifurcation occurs in our model . in section [ sectiondiscussion ] , numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that our results can be used to explain the long period oscillations observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia .",
    "denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the population densities of resting an proliferating cells , respectively , which have spent a time @xmath12 in their phase at time @xmath13 .",
    "resting cells can either be lost randomly at a rate @xmath14 , which takes into account the cellular differentiation , or entry into the proliferating phase at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "proliferating cells can be lost by apoptosis ( a programmed cell death ) at a rate @xmath16 and , at mitosis , cells with age @xmath17 divide in two daughter cells ( which immediately enter the @xmath3-phase ) with a rate @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 if @xmath21 with @xmath22 moreover , it is assumed to be piecewisely continuous such that @xmath23 .",
    "the later assumption describes the fact that cells which did not die have to divide before they reach the maximal age @xmath24 .",
    "the nature of the trigger signal for introduction in the proliferating phase is not clear .",
    "however , the work of sachs @xcite shows that we can reasonably think that it strongly depends on the entire resting cell population , that is @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the function @xmath15 is supposed to be continuous and positive . furthermore , from a reasonable biological point of view , we assume that @xmath15 is decreasing with @xmath27 .",
    "this describes the fact that the rate of re - entry into the proliferating compartment is a decreasing function of the @xmath3-phase population .",
    "usually , it is believed that the function @xmath15 is a monotone decreasing hill function ( see mackey @xcite ) , given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the maximal rate of re - entry in the proliferating phase , @xmath33 is the number of resting cells at which @xmath15 has its maximum rate of change with respect to the resting phase population , and @xmath34 describes the sensitivity of the reintroduction rate with changes in the population .",
    "the above parameters values are usually chosen ( see mackey @xcite ) to be @xmath35 although an usual value of @xmath33 is @xmath36 cells / kg , it can be normalized without loss of generality when one makes a qualitative analysis of the population .",
    "then @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy the system of partial differential equations @xmath37 with @xmath38.\\ ] ] the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 give the population densities of cells which have spent a time @xmath17 in the resting and proliferating phase , respectively , at time @xmath41 ; that is the initial populations of cells with age @xmath17 in each phase .",
    "the boundary conditions of system ( [ n])([p ] ) , which describe the cellular flux between the two phases , are given by @xmath42 moreover , we suppose that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the total population density of proliferating cells at time @xmath46 ; then @xmath47 thus , integrating ( [ n ] ) and ( [ p ] ) with respect to the age variable , we obtain @xmath48 we define a function @xmath49 by @xmath50 set @xmath51 one can check that @xmath7 is a density function , supported on @xmath52 $ ] , and @xmath7 represents the density of division of proliferating cells . in particularly , @xmath53 .    using the method of characteristics to determine @xmath11 , we deduce , from ( [ eqx])([eqy ] ) , that the process of hematopoiesis is described by the following system : @xmath54    one can give a direct biological explanation of system ( [ restingphase ] ) .    in the equation for the resting cells @xmath55 , the first term in the right - hand side accounts for @xmath3-cell loss due to either the mortality and cellular differentiation ( @xmath56 ) or introduction in the proliferating phase ( @xmath15 ) . the second term represents a cellular gain due to the movement of proliferating cells one generation earlier .",
    "it requires some explanations .",
    "first , we recall that all cells divide according to the density @xmath7 , supported on @xmath8 $ ]",
    ". we shall call , in the following , new proliferating cells , the resting cells introduced in the proliferating phase at the considered time @xmath46 . when @xmath57 , no new proliferating cell is mature enough to divide , because cells can not divide before they have spent a time @xmath58 in the proliferating phase .",
    "therefore , the cellular gain can only proceed from cells initially in the proliferating phase .",
    "when @xmath59 $ ] , the cellular increase is obtained by division of new proliferating cells and by division of the initial population . finally , when @xmath60 , all initial proliferating cells have divided or died , and the cellular gain is obtained by division of new proliferating cells introduced one generation earlier .",
    "the factor @xmath61 always accounts for the division of each cell into two daughter cells at mitosis .",
    "the term @xmath62 , with @xmath63 $ ] , describes the attenuation of the population , in the proliferating phase , due to apoptosis .    in the equation for the proliferating cells @xmath64 the first term in the right - hand side accounts for cellular loss by apoptosis and the second term is for cellular entry from the @xmath3-phase .",
    "the last term accounts for the flux of proliferating cells to the resting compartment .",
    "we set @xmath65 .",
    "then , initially , the populations in the two phases are given by @xmath66 at this point , one can make a remark .",
    "since resting cells are introduced in the proliferating phase with a rate @xmath15 , then @xmath67 , which represents the population of cells introduced at time @xmath41 in the cycle , must satisfy @xmath68 taking into account the inevitable loss of proliferating cells by apoptosis and by division , we suppose that @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 this simply describes that @xmath71 satisfies ( [ p ] ) ( see webb @xcite , page 8) . with ( [ gamma ] ) and integrating by parts , the initial conditions of system ( [ restingphase ] ) become @xmath72 when @xmath73 , we have @xmath74    assume that the function @xmath75 is lipschitz continuous . it is immediate to show by steps that , for all @xmath76 , the system ( [ restingphase ] ) under condition ( [ initialconditions ] ) has a unique nonnegative continuous solution @xmath77 defined on @xmath78 .",
    "one can notice that problem ( [ restingphase ] ) reduces to a system of two delay differential equations , with initial conditions solutions of a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "on @xmath79 $ ] , the first equation for @xmath55 in system ( [ restingphase ] ) reduces to the ordinary differential equation @xmath80 and , on @xmath52 $ ] , the second equation reduces to the following nonautonomous delay differential equation @xmath81,\\\\ \\varphi(t)&=&\\widetilde{\\varphi}(t ) , & t\\in[0,\\underline{\\tau } ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the unique solution of ( [ phitildeproblem ] ) for the initial condition @xmath83 .    by the same way",
    ", the solution @xmath45 of the second equation in ( [ restingphase ] ) , denoted by @xmath84 , is given in terms of the unique solution @xmath82 of ( [ phitildeproblem ] ) , associated with @xmath83 , and the unique solution @xmath85 of ( [ phiproblem ] ) , for @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "then , the system ( [ restingphase ] ) can be written as an autonomous system of delay differential equations , for @xmath60 ,    [ problem ] @xmath86 & & \\displaystyle\\frac{dy}{dt}=-\\gamma y(t)+\\beta(x(t))x(t ) -\\displaystyle\\int_{\\underline{\\tau}}^{\\overline{\\tau } } e^{-\\gamma\\tau}f(\\tau)\\beta(x(t-\\tau ) ) x(t-\\tau ) d\\tau,\\label{equationy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with , for @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 the solutions of ( [ equationy ] ) are given explicitly by @xmath89 one can notice that @xmath45 does not depend anymore on the initial population @xmath69 after one generation , that is when @xmath60 .",
    "this can be explained as follows : cells initially in the proliferating phase have divided or died after one generation ; hence , new cells in the proliferating phase can only come from resting cells @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , one may have already noticed that the solutions of ( [ equationx ] ) do not depend on the solutions of ( [ equationy ] ) whereas the converse is not true .",
    "the expression of @xmath45 in ( [ y ] ) gives more precise information on the influence of the behavior of @xmath55 on the stability of the solutions @xmath45 .",

    "among the wide range of diseases affecting blood cells , periodic hematological diseases ( haurie _ et al_. @xcite ) are of main importance because of their intrinsic nature .",
    "these diseases are characterized by significant oscillations in the number of circulating cells , with periods ranging from weeks ( 1921 days for cyclical neutropenia @xcite ) to months ( 30 to 100 days for chronic myelogenous leukemia @xcite ) and amplitudes varying from normal to low levels or normal to high levels , depending on the cells types @xcite .",
    "because of their dynamic character , periodic hematological diseases offer an opportunity to understand some of the regulating processes involved in the production of hematopoietic cells , which are still not well - understood .",
    "some periodic hematological diseases involve only one type of blood cells , for example , red blood cells in periodic auto - immune hemolytic anemia ( blair _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) or platelets in cyclical thrombocytopenia ( santillan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in these cases ,",
    "periods of the oscillations are usually between two and four times the bone marrow production delay",

    "a destabilization of the pluripotential stem cell population ( from which all of the mature blood cells types are derived ) seems to be at the origin of these diseases .",
    "we focus , in particularly , on chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) , a cancer of the white cells , resulting from the malignant transformation of a single pluripotential stem cell in the bone marrow ( pujo - menjouet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . as described in morley _",
    "@xcite , oscillations can be observed in patients with cml , with the same period for white cells , red blood cells and platelets .",
    "this is called periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia ( pcml ) . the period of the oscillations in pcml ranges from 30 to 100 days ( haurie _ et al_. @xcite , fortin and mackey @xcite ) , depending on patients .",
    "the difference between these periods and the average pluripotential cell cycle duration ( between 1 to 4 days , as observed in mouses , see mackey @xcite ) is still not well - understood .    recently , to understand the dynamics of periodic chronic myelogenous leukemia , pujo - menjouet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a model for the regulation of stem cell dynamics and investigated the influence of parameters in this stem cell model on the oscillations period when the model becomes unstable and starts to oscillate . in this paper , taking into account the fact that a cell cycle has two phases , that is , stem cells in process are either in a resting phase or actively proliferating , and assuming that cells divide at different ages , we proposed a system of differential equations with distributed delay to model the dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells . by constructing a lyapunov functional , we gave conditions for the trivial equilibrium to be globally asymptotically stable .",
    "local stability and hopf bifurcation of the nontrivial equilibrium were studied , the existence of a hopf bifurcation leading to the appearance of periodic solutions in this model , with a period around 30 days at the bifurcation .",

    "[ figoscillations1 ] , solutions oscillate around the equilibrium values with periods around 45 days .",

    "experimental data from patients with pcml suggest that the shape of oscillations is of a relaxation oscillator type @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fowler and mackey @xcite showed that a model for hematopoiesis with a discrete delay may also exhibit relaxation oscillations .",
