    "the gas in these clumps can be significantly affected by the feedback from newly formed stars , thus blurring our understanding of cluster formation . to explore the initial conditions and details of cluster formation , it is then necessary to study molecular clouds in the early stages of evolution at high - angular resolution ( e.g. , higuchi et al .",
    "high - mass stars are usually deeply embedded in their parent cloud , obscuring their early formative stages .",
    "their formation timescales of @xmath3 10@xmath13  yr are short , and they form in distant clusters and associations ( e.g. , mckee @xmath9 ostriker 2007 ; zinnecker @xmath9 yorke 2007 ) .",
    "these factors also contribute to our poor understanding of their formation processes .",
    "high angular resolution observations are indispensable in the efforts to unveil the mystery of high - mass star formation .",
    "millimeter and sub - millimeter interferometric observations have contributed largely to the current knowledge of high - mass star formation .",

    "the dust continuum emission is overlaid in black contours . from figure [ fig2](b ) , we identified two bipolar outflows , one aligned in the northeast - southwest direction ( outflow-1 , r1-b1 in figure [ fig2](b ) ) , and the other aligned in the northwest - southeast direction ( outflow-2 , r2-b2 in figure [ fig2](b ) ) . the velocity ranges were selected to separate distinct features of both outflows lobes .",
    "these outflows appear at considerably smaller angular scales than the wide - angle bipolar outflow detected with apex and their position angles are different .",
    "we found another red - shifted component associated with the s1 h@xmath5o maser cluster to the south of the continuum peak .",
    "for s1 , @xcite suggested the existence of a yso candidate associated with this component from their vla observations .",
    "this yso may have a different systemic velocity from that of the central continuum source , thus the @xmath0co(32 ) component appeared to be dominantly red - shifted with reference to the systemic velocity of the central object .",

    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows the velocity integrated intensity map of the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission ( color and contours ) .",
    "the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission from the central region is strong and well correlated with the dust continuum emission . at fainter levels , the ch@xmath1oh(76 )",
    "emission appears as weak filaments elongated to the northeast , southeast , northwest , and southwest , forming an hourglass structure . in order to investigate the detailed velocity structure of the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission ,",
    "we produced first and second moment maps ( figures [ fig3](b ) and [ fig3](c ) , respectively ) .",
    "in the first moment map , we see towards the central region a similar velocity gradient as is seen in so@xmath5 , which might be keplerian rotation @xcite . in the second moment map ,",
    "the region associated with dust continuum emission exhibits a large velocity dispersion of @xmath310  km  s@xmath25 .",
    "ch@xmath1oh is predominantly formed on grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "although small ch@xmath1oh abundances can be found in cold , quiescent environments @xcite , ch@xmath1oh is largely released into the gas phase by processes related to active star - formation : heating from protostars or sputtering of the grain mantles produced by the interaction of molecular outflows and the ambient gas ( e.g. , sakai et al .",
    "2013 ; yanagida et al .",
    "2014 ) . to compare the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission with that of the outflows ,",
    "we show the second moment map of ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission overlaid with the velocity integrated maps of the blue - shifted and red - shifted @xmath0co(32 ) emission in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we find that the northeast and southwest walls of the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) hourglass structure are located at the edge of the northeast and southwest lobes of outflow-1 , respectively , suggesting a relationship .",
    "we also find that the red - shifted component of outflow-2 , r1 is associated with the ring - like wall located southeast of the central source . in addition , there is a good correlation between the spatial distribution of the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission and the ch@xmath1oh maser spots . from all these results ,",
    "we conclude that the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission traces zones of post shocked gas produced by the interaction of multiple outflows with the ambient gas within the iras16547@xmath24247 region .",
    "h@xmath5o masers @xcite and class i ch@xmath1oh maser clusters @xcite have been detected towards the iras16547@xmath24247 region ( see figures [ fig2](a ) and [ fig4 ] ) . in high - mass star - forming regions , h@xmath5o masers",
    "are predominantly located within a few milliarcseconds from the central driving sources , tracing gas motions in the vicinity of the protostar @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "class i ch@xmath1oh maser clusters are usually excited at the shocked interface between a high - velocity jet , or outflow , and the ambient gas cloud .",
    "the g1 and g2 h@xmath5o masers detected by @xcite are located within the continuum peak and close to the centers of the two bipolar outflows ( see figure [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) ) , suggesting that they could mark the position of the driving sources of the outflows .",
    "higher angular resolution observations are required to identify the driving sources and make a more precise relation with g1 and g2 .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath5o masers located at the position of s1 are most likely excited by a different yso , thus adding to the multiplicity of the protostars in the region .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] indicates the spatial distribution of the four class i ch@xmath1oh maser clusters , @xcite present within the field of the alma observations .",
    "there are four class i ch@xmath1oh maser clusters in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the clusters located northeast and southwest of the central source roughly aligns with outflow-1 , while the maser cluster seen towards the northwest aligns with the blue - shifted lobe of outflow-2 , b2 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig4 ] indicate the directions of the outflows estimated by using the position of ch@xmath1oh maser clusters .",
    "the northern cluster coincides with the location of the the jet knots of @xcite , and may have been excited by the shock influence of the jet . a schematic diagram to visualize the star formation activities in the region based on previous observations and our alma results",
    "is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .      in an attempt to explain the observed morphology of the shocks traced by the ch@xmath1oh(76 ) emission , we discuss two possible scenarios that may be responsible for the hourglass structure seen in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the first of the plausible scenarios is the precession of the biconical jet reported by @xcite(see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the interaction of the high - velocity precessing jet with the dense ambient medium results in strong shocks , which will trace a larger biconical structure ( as seen in the morphology of the narrow - angle ch@xmath1oh(76 ) wall ) . assuming that the opening angle of the observed narrow - angle ch@xmath1oh(76 ) wall is the angle subtended by the minor axis at a distance of one - half the major axis",
    ", we derived the opening angle of the narrow - angle ch@xmath1oh(76 ) wall to be @xmath345  @xmath30 .",
    "the jet has an opening angle of 15@xmath30 , implying that the jet will need to precess through 30@xmath30 to create the observed narrow - angle ch@xmath1oh(76 ) wall .",
    "@xcite assumed that the jet seems to be precessing linearly with time , and derived a precession rate , @xmath43 , of 0@xmath30.08  yr@xmath25 ( @xmath43=@xmath44@xmath45 , with @xmath44@xmath32@xmath30.3  arcsec@xmath25 and a jet velocity , @xmath45 , of @xmath3490  km  s@xmath25 as in rodrguez et al .",
    "2008 ) . assuming that these rates of the n1 and s1 represent the precession rate of the entire jet",
    ", we estimated that it would take the collimated precessing jet about @xmath3  380  yr to produce the observed morphology .",
    "the second scenario is that of multiple , or at least two , driving sources powering intersecting outflows .",
    "@xcite showed two outflow lobes , which may be suggestive of a single driving source .",
    "but @xmath0co(32 ) at high - angular resolution with alma shows two outflows ; one aligned in northwest - southeast direction , and the other one aligned in the northeast - southwest direction ( figures [ fig2](b ) and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this points to the multiplicity of the protostars driving outflows in the region .",
    "this agrees with the distribution of the class i ch@xmath1oh masers of @xcite , which also suggest the presence of more than one outflow source in the region .",
    "the complexity of the outflow structures could be explained by interaction of the outflowing materials from different driving sources .",
