    "quantum information theory has progressed considerably over the last decade : today we understand much better the information transmission properties of quantum channels , and entanglement has turned from an oddity first into a valuable effect and then into a quantifiable resource , as shown by the many well  motivated entanglement measures that have been put forward .",
    "almost all of them are operationally grounded as some optimal performance parameter , and can be written as solutions to various high  dimensional or even asymptotic optimisation problems .",
    "all of these capacities and entanglement measures raise the natural problem of _ additvity _ under tensor products , i.e. the question , if the independent supply of two specimens of the resource has as its performance the sum of the performances of the individual objects ( be they channels or states ) .",
    "for some of the current measures of entanglement additivity has been disproved by counterexamples ( for the so  called _ relative entropy of entanglement _ in  @xcite ) , for others , like the distillable entanglement  @xcite it is claimed improbable  @xcite . for some , however , additivity is still widely conjectured , most notably for a bound on the distillable entanglement by rains  @xcite , and for the _ entanglement of formation _  @xcite .",
    "the literature on the subject is vast and increasing rapidly , and in the present paper we will only make a small contribution .",
    "we shall be concerned with the entanglement of formation , and with the aforementioned classical capacity of quantum channels , pointing out a connection between the two that also relates their additivity problems .",
    "we outline briefly the content of the rest of the paper : in sections  [ sec : hcap ] and  [ sec : entf ] the classical capacity of a channel and the entanglement of formation of a state are reviewed . in section  [ sec : stine ] a simple observation on the stinespring dilation of a completely positive map provides the link between the two quantities , which is exploited in a number of examples in section  [ sec : examples ] ; group symmetry is introduced in section  [ sec : symmetry ] , adding another example , and to supply formulas valid for a class of channels which includes examples discussed in section  [ sec : stine ] as special cases . and in section  [ sec : gap ] some of these results",
    "are used to demonstrate a gap between entanglement cost and distillable entanglement .    in section  [ sec : superadd ] we discuss _ superadditivity _ of entanglement of formation as a ( conjectured ) property which would unify the additivity questions considered here : it implies additivity of entanglement of formation , of channel capacity , and of channel capacity with a linear cost constraint .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our observations and related works .",
    "we consider block coding of classical information via the quantum channel @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hilbert spaces . if the encoding is restricted to _",
    "product states _ it is known  @xcite that the capacity is given by @xmath5 where the _ holevo mutual information _ of an ensemble @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the von neumann entropy of a state . for finite dimensional @xmath4 the @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap ] ) is indeed a @xmath10 , attained for an ensemble of at most @xmath11 states .",
    "it is conjectured that for a product of channels making use of entangled input states does not help to increase the capacity : @xmath12 ( the question is implicit in  @xcite and the above references , and made explicit in  @xcite , where it was speculated that the answer may be negative . )",
    "this would imply that @xmath13 is the classical capacity of @xmath0 .",
    "observe that here the inequality `` @xmath14 '' follows immediately from the fact that the right hand side can be achived using product states . without additivity ,",
    "the general formula for this capacity reads @xmath15 despite much recent activity on the question  @xcite , and even proofs of the additivity conjecture in some cases  @xcite , it is still a wide open problem .",
    "let @xmath1 be a state on @xmath16 .",
    "the _ entanglement of formation _ of @xmath1 is defined as @xmath17 where the _ ( entropy of ) entanglement _ for a pure state @xmath18 on @xmath16 is defined as @xmath19 if the rank of @xmath1 is finite the @xmath20 is in fact a @xmath21 , achieved for an ensemble of at most @xmath22 elements .",
    "this quantity was proposed in  @xcite as a measure of how costly in terms of entanglement the creation of @xmath1 is .",
    "it is conjectured ( but only in a few cases proved : the only published examples are in  @xcite ) that @xmath23 is an additive function with respect to tensor products : @xmath24 observe that , as in the case of the holevo capacity , `` @xmath25 '' follows easily from the fact that the right hand side is achieved by product state ensembles . if this would turn out to be true , the _ entanglement cost _ @xmath26 of @xmath1 , i.e. the asymptotic rate of epr pairs to approximately create @xmath27 copies of @xmath1 is given by @xmath28 : in  @xcite it was proved rigorously that @xmath29    note that the function @xmath23 has the property of being a _ convex roof _ : @xmath30 the cases in which @xmath23 is known are arbitrary states of @xmath31systems  @xcite , isotropic states in arbitrary dimension  @xcite , werner and oo  symmetric states  @xcite , and some other highly symmetric states  @xcite .",
    "due to a theorem of stinespring  @xcite the completely positive and trace preserving map @xmath0 can be presented as the composition of an isometric embedding of @xmath3 into a bipartite system with a partial trace : @xmath32 see  @xcite for a discussion on how to construct this from the so  called kraus ( operator sum ) representation  @xcite , @xmath33 with @xmath34 , of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall use this construction later on in the examples  [ expl : general : depol ] and  [ expl : d - dim : depol ] .    by embedding into larger spaces we can present @xmath35 as restriction of a unitary , which often we silently assume done . denote @xmath36 , the image subspace of @xmath35 .",
    "then we can say that @xmath0 is equivalent to the partial trace channel , with inputs restricted to states on @xmath37 .",
    "this entails :    [ thm : hcap : entf ] @xmath38    very simple : choosing an input ensemble for @xmath0 amounts by our above observation to choosing an ensemble @xmath39 on @xmath37 . denoting @xmath40 , the average output state of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap ] ) is just @xmath41 , while the indivual output states are the @xmath42 .",
    "hence the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap ] ) , the average of output entropies , has as its infimum @xmath28 when we vary over ensembles with fixed @xmath1 .",
    "note that if we choose the dimension of @xmath43 large enough , every channel from @xmath3 to @xmath4 corresponds to a subspace of @xmath16 ( though not uniquely ) and vice versa .",
    "[ rem : connes : etal ] the quantity @xmath44 in the optimisation problem in theorem  [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] equals the _ entropy of the subalgebra @xmath45 in @xmath46 _ , as defined by connes , narnhofer and thirring  @xcite : this was observed by benatti , narnhofer and uhlmann  @xcite .",
    "this has interesting consequences : for each subspace @xmath37 of the tensor product there is a convex set @xmath47 of states @xmath1 supported on it which maximise eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) .",
    "the reason for convexity is again very simple : let @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath49 by concavity ( convexity ) of @xmath50 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence the aim function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) is concave , which implies that the set of @xmath1 for which it is at least @xmath51 is a convex set , for any real @xmath51 .",
    "observe that by this argument both @xmath52 and @xmath28 are constants for @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , one can show ( see the discussion below , in this section ) that even all @xmath41 , @xmath53 , are identical .    for such states",
    "the additivity of @xmath23 is implied by the additivity of @xmath54 for the corresponding channels : indeed , assume that for two channels @xmath0 , @xmath55 that optimal input states in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) are @xmath53 , @xmath56 , respectively , with reduced states @xmath57 and @xmath58 . then , assuming additivity we get @xmath59 hence @xmath60 which by our earlier remarks implies additivity .",
    "thus we have proved    [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] if for any two channels @xmath0 and @xmath55 , each with a stinespring dilation chosen as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : embedding ] ) , @xmath61 , then @xmath62 @xmath63    most interesting is the case when we know @xmath64 , because then we can conclude @xmath65 , thus determining the entanglement cost of @xmath1 ( see section  [ sec : entf ] ) .",
    "for example , king  @xcite proved this for unital qubit ",
    "channels , shor  @xcite for entanglement  breaking channels , and king  @xcite for arbitrary depolarising channels , giving rise to a host of states for which we thus know that the entanglement cost equals @xmath23 .",
    "examples are discussed in section  [ sec : examples ] below and the following two sections .",
    "it is natural to consider ways to implement an implication of additivity going the other way than theorem  [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] : from entanglement of formation to holevo capacity .    indeed , in another look at eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) , let us focus on the other quantity of interest in the optimisation : this is the von neumann entropy of the output state .",
    "in general , while there can be many ensembles maximising eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap ] ) ( let us assume for the moment that the output space is finite dimensional ) , and in fact many averages @xmath66 ( the set @xmath47 of optimal input states introduced above ) , the average output state of such an optimal ensemble , @xmath67 , is _ unique _ : the reason is the strict concavity of the von neumann entropy , so if we had two ensembles with different output states , mixing the ensembles would strictly increase the holevo mutual information .",
    "let us denote this optimal output state @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that the additivity conjecture eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : add ] ) implies that @xmath69 but the reverse seems not obvious .",
    "still , eq .  ( [ eq : omega : mult ] ) might be a reasonable first step towards proving additivity of @xmath13 in general .",
    "unfortunately , even assuming additivity of the entanglement of formation , we have not been able to derive additivity of the channel capacity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega : mult ] ) .    however , let us assume that for the product channel @xmath70 an optimal _ input _ state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) is a product ( due to the non  uniqueness of optimal input states there might also be entangled ones ! ) , @xmath71 , say .",
    "then clearly , @xmath72 implies @xmath73 , in a reversal of the argument from the proof of theorem  [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] .",
    "looking at eq .  ( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) , and trying to find a unifying reason why both of the above discussed additivity conjectures should hold , we are led to speculate that @xmath23 might not only be additive with respect to tensor products ( eq .  ( [ eq : entf : add ] ) ) , but have even a superadditivity property for arbitrary states on a composition of two bipartite systems :    let @xmath1 be a state on @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then superadditivity means that @xmath77 where all entanglements of formation are understood with respect to the @xmath78@xmath79partition of the respective system .",
    "( this relation was apparently first considered in  @xcite , and called _ strong superadditivity _ there .",
    "we call it just `` superadditivity '' here in simple analogy to , e.g. , subadditivity of the von neumann entropy . )",
    "note that this implies additivity of @xmath23 when applied to @xmath80 since we remarked in section  [ sec : entf ] that the other inequality is trivial .",
    "note on the other hand that it also implies additivity of @xmath13 , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : alt ] ) in section  [ sec : stine ] : by replacing a supposedly optimal @xmath1 on @xmath81 ( for two channels @xmath0 and @xmath55 , and corresponding stinespring dilations which give rise to the subspaces @xmath37 and @xmath82 in respective bipartite systems ) by the tensor product of its marginals , we can only increase the entropy ( subadditivity ) , and only decrease the entanglement of formation ( superadditivity ) .    as an extension ,",
    "let us show that it even implies an additivity formula for the classical capacity under _ linear cost constraints _ ( see  @xcite ) : in this problem , there is given a selfadjoint operator @xmath83 on the input system , and a real number @xmath84 , additional to the channel @xmath0 .",
    "as signal states we allow only such states @xmath85 on @xmath86 for which @xmath87 , with @xmath88 ( i.e. , their average cost is asymptotically bounded by @xmath84 )",
    ". then it can be shown  @xcite that the capacity @xmath89 in the thus constrained system _ and using product states _ is given by a maximisation as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap ] ) , only that the ensembles @xmath39 are restricted by @xmath90 .",
    "( the same treatment applies if there are several linear cost inequalties of this kind .",
    "it is only for simplicity of notation that we stick to the case of a single one . ) because of the linearity of this condition in the states this yields a formula for @xmath89 very similar to theorem  [ thm : hcap : entf ] : @xmath91 by the general arguments given in previous sections we can conclude that this function is concave in @xmath84 .",
    "the question of course is again , if entangled inputs help to increase the capacity , or if @xmath92 we shall show that this indeed follows from the superadditivity , by showing the following : for channels @xmath0 , @xmath55 , cost operators @xmath83 , @xmath93 , and cost threshold @xmath94 : @xmath95 ( then , by induction and using the concavity , the equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : cost : add ] ) follows . )    indeed , `` @xmath14 '' is obvious by choosing , for @xmath96 , optimal states @xmath1 , @xmath97 in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcap : cost : alt ] ) , and considering @xmath71 . in the other direction , assume any optimal @xmath98 for the product system , with marginal states @xmath1 and @xmath97 : by definition , @xmath99 so also the product @xmath71 is admissible , and since there exist @xmath84 , @xmath100 summing to @xmath94 such that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , the claim follows in exactly the same way as for the unconstrained capacity .    we have thus proved :    [ thm : superstrong ] superadditivity of @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : entf : superadd ] ) , implies additivity of entanglement of formation , of the holevo capacity and of the holevo capacity with cost constraint under tensor products .",
    "@xmath63    observe the strong intuitive appeal of the superadditivity property : it says that by measuring the entanglement via @xmath23 , a system can only appear less entangled if judged by looking at its subsystems individually .",
    "note that this is almost trivially true ( by definition ) for the _ distillable entanglement _ , while wrong for the _ relative entropy of entanglement _",
    "@xcite , because this would make it an additive quantity , which we know it is nt  @xcite .",
    "the superadditivity also bears semblance to a distributional property of the so  called _ tangle _  @xcite .",
    "superadditivity is thus a very strong property .",
    "if there is one `` nice '' underlying mathematical structure to the additivity of @xmath23 , it should indeed be this .",
    "note that it is true if one of the marginal states , say @xmath103 , is separable : because then its @xmath23 is @xmath104 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : entf : superadd ] ) simply expresses the monotonicity of @xmath23 under local operations ( in this case : partial traces ) .",
    "this was previously noted in  @xcite .",
    "observe that it is sufficient to prove superadditivity for a _ pure _ state @xmath105 , as then we can apply it to an optimal decomposition of @xmath1 , together with the convex roof property , eq .",
    "( [ eq : entf : convroof ] ) .",
    "this was apparently considered by benatti and narnhofer  @xcite , who even conjectured `` good decompositions '' of the reduced states @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this latter conjecture however was refuted by vollbrecht and werner  @xcite who constructed a counterexample .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is limited positive evidence in favour of superadditivity : in  @xcite , eq .",
    "( 16 ) , it is actually proved if the partial trace in one of the subsystems is entanglement  breaking .",
    "we observed ( following  @xcite ) that it is trivially true if one of the reduced states is separable .",
    "some of our examples yield more cases of superadditivity .",
    "e.g.  in example  [ expl : d - dim : depol ] we constructed the subspaces @xmath108 : for every pure state @xmath109 , with reduced density operators @xmath110 we get ( using the additivity of the minimal output entropy proved in  @xcite ) @xmath111 the second line by the insight of example  [ expl : d - dim : depol ] that all states supported on @xmath112 have the same entanglement of formation .",
    "similarly , our other examples yield certain pure states for which we obtain superadditivity .",
    "it seems to us that this question most elegantly sums up the two most prominent additivity question in quantum information theory , and we would like to pose it as a challenge : either to prove superadditivity ( thus proving additivity of @xmath23 and of @xmath54 ) , or to find a counterexample .",
    "in this and the following two sections we want to demonstrate how theorem  [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] can be used to construct nontrivial states for which we can compute the entanglement cost , to reproduce some known results of this sort , and even exhibit `` irreversibility of entanglement '' .",
    "[ expl : general : depol ] consider the generalised depolarising channels of qubits : @xmath113 with @xmath114 , the familiar pauli matrices @xmath115 and a probability distribution @xmath116 . for these channels additivity of the capacity under tensor product with an arbitrary channel",
    "was proved in  @xcite .",
    "note that up to unitary transformations on input and output system each unital qubit channel has this form , by the classification of qubit maps of king and ruskai  @xcite , and fujiwara and algoet  @xcite . by this result",
    "we also can assume that @xmath117    it is easy to see that for such a channel the capacity is given by @xmath118 , with the _ minimal output entropy _ achieved at the eigenstates @xmath119 of @xmath120 : @xmath121 .",
    "an optimal ensemble is the uniform distribution on these states .",
    "it is easy to construct a stinespring dilation for this map , by an isometry @xmath122 , in block form : @xmath123 and the corresponding subspace @xmath124 is spanned by @xmath125 the optimal input state corresponds to the equal mixture @xmath126 of these two pure states .    from these observations , together with theorem  [ thm : cc :",

    "this implies that _ any _ convex combination of these states is a formation  optimal decomposition ( this argument was also used in  @xcite to extend the domain of states with known entanglement of formation ) .",

    "( [ eq : king : ruskai ] ) .",
    "the partial transpose @xmath230 of the optimal state @xmath126 decomposes into a direct sum of two @xmath231matrices , which turn out to have the same characteristic equation @xmath232 since @xmath233 has only one negative root @xmath234 and @xmath235 is decreasing in a neighbourhood of it , @xmath236 is equivalent to @xmath237 using @xmath238 .",
    "that is , if @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 satisfy this inequality , there is a gap between the entanglement cost of @xmath126 , and its distillable entanglement ; figure  [ fig:1 ] shows a plot of the region of these @xmath243 . by continuity , also for a mixture of @xmath133 and @xmath244 which is sufficiently close to @xmath126 , we observe a similar gap .",

    "if @xmath250 and @xmath251 , @xmath252 , we can even prove for _ all _ true mixtures @xmath253 of @xmath133 and @xmath244 , that @xmath254 holds : by eq .",

    ".    the convexity of trace norm and the observation @xmath259 leads , for @xmath260 ( which we may assume by symmetry ) , to @xmath261 and consequently we have @xmath262 .    this fact is also proven by noting that the negativity is _ strictly _ convex for mixings of @xmath133 and @xmath244 , i.e. @xmath263 if @xmath264 .",

    "this additivity can be extended to even more states , though it is not clear how far this would get us , even taking the general additivity conjecture for granted .",
    "it is obvious that we only probed the scope of the method , and it is clear that other examples of the same sort can be constructed , adding to the list of states for which the entanglement cost is known .",
    "each channel for which additivity of its capacity is established will add to this list .",

    "the attempt to link the two additivity conjectures considered here led us to consider the superadditivity of entanglement of formation as a relation which integrates them neatly .",
    "we were even able to exhibit a few cases where it is known to hold , providing modest evidence in favour of it .",
    "* since completion of this work , * subsequent research has further clarified the picture presented here : ruskai ( quant - ph/0303141 ) showed that not all bipartite states can be associated with a channel such as to make use of theorem  [ thm : cc : implies : ee ] to prove additivity .",
    "audenaert and braunstein ( quant - ph/0303045 ) have re  expressed the superadditivity of entanglement of formation using tools from convex analysis , and showed that the multiplicativity conjecture for maximal output @xmath222norms  @xcite , for @xmath222 close to @xmath78 , of filtering operations implies superadditivity .",
