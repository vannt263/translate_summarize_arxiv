    "the fit was carried out in the mass interval @xmath92  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the resonant hypothesis for @xmath71 and @xmath4 waves with a mass - independent production phase gives a @xmath93dof=1.14 for 28 degrees of freedom .",
    "the non - resonant hypothesis ( no phase variation for the @xmath4 wave ) gives @xmath93dof=3.02 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ averag_npw]c that a single resonant phase for the @xmath88 ( dotted line ) with a constant ( non - resonant ) @xmath4 wave is not satisfactory .    the contrast between the @xmath94 phase variation and the @xmath71 phase variation with mass ( fig .",
    "[ averag_npw]c , solid line ) shows clearly that the observed phase variation is consistent with interference between two resonant waves .",
    "it s worth pointing out that the mass dependence of the @xmath94 relative phase would be nearly flat if each wave were resonant with very similar masses and widths .",
    "the @xmath4 resonant parameters from the fit with the average solutions and the average error matrix @xcite are : @xmath95  mev / c@xmath83 and @xmath96  mev / c@xmath83 .",
    "the second method was similar to the first except that instead of fitting the average solutions , a large number @xmath97 of randomly chosen combinations of ambiguous solutions in each mass bin were used as input to the mass - dependent fit .",
    "the obtained distributions of the mass and width of the @xmath4 resonance for those fits with acceptable values of @xmath98 ( that is , those with @xmath99 ) were then fitted by a gaussian .",

    "our analysis shows that this spread due to the different ambiguous solutions dominates the systematic error .",
    "the third method used was to carry out a mass - dependent partial wave analysis ( mdpwa ) @xcite . in this procedure ,",
    "an extended maximum likelihood function is generalized to include not only the angular distribution , but also the @xmath104 mass distribution for each wave .",
    "this analysis is free from the problem of ambiguous solutions but it is necessary to parameterize the mass dependence of every partial wave ( including the unpws ) and all relative phases .",
    "we use the same parametrization for the @xmath71 and @xmath4 waves as in the first two methods .",
    "the mass dependence of the unpw waves were chosen to be polynomials of second order with constant phases except for the @xmath66 wave .",
    "the @xmath66 wave was fitted with a bw function using the @xmath105 resonance parameters .",
    "the mdpwa results for the @xmath4 wave are @xmath106  mev / c@xmath83 and @xmath107  mev / c@xmath83 , consistent with the results of methods 1 and 2 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a pure @xmath71 wave can artificially induce a @xmath4 wave due to the effects of finite acceptance and resolution .",
    "this  leakage \" leads to a @xmath4 wave that mimics the @xmath71 intensity and phase . in our case",
    ", the @xmath4 intensity would therefore have an intensity with the shape of the @xmath88 and a @xmath94 phase difference which does nt depend on mass .",
    "these features allowed us to include in the mdpwa fit a leakage term with these features .",
    "we observed that the leakage contribution to the @xmath4 wave from the @xmath71 wave is negligible .",
    "evidence for a resonance interpretation for the @xmath4 wave is primarily the behavior of the @xmath94 relative phase ( fig .",
    "[ averag_npw]c ) . since the @xmath71 phase variation is well known because of the @xmath88 production , it is clear that the @xmath4 phase can not be constant ( see dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ averag_npw]c ) and it is well - described by a bw phase variation .    the ratio of the @xmath4 and @xmath71 intensities in the range @xmath108  gev is equal to @xmath109 . this ratio is larger than that for the @xmath14 system , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mass of the neutral exotic @xmath19 state , decaying into @xmath20 , observed here ( @xmath110  mev / c@xmath111 ) is lower than the mass observed in the crystal barrel experiment @xcite ( @xmath112  mev / c@xmath111 ) by about 100  mev although the results are barely consistent within errors .",
    "the width measured here ( @xmath113  mev / c@xmath83 ) is also consistent with that from the crystal barrel measurement ( @xmath114  mev / c@xmath83 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that our result is similar to those obtained from the low-@xmath30 fits in ref .",
    "they obtained @xmath115  mev / c@xmath111 and @xmath116  mev / c@xmath83 in one analysis , and @xmath117  mev / c@xmath111 and @xmath118  mev / c@xmath83 in a fit to the experimental moments .",
    "no systematic errors were given for either method .",
    "the lower mass found in our analysis may be a consequence of interference between the resonant state and background in the @xmath20 system , some of which may be from rescattering between the @xmath36 and the @xmath119 .",
    "it is also possible that two or more resonant @xmath19 states may be present in the @xmath9 decay channel in the mass interval mass between 1200 and 1400  mev as might be expected if the exotic state is a four quark state .",
    "the mass for the @xmath120 is some 100 mev below the negatively charged @xmath121 measured by crystal barrel @xcite and bnl - e852 @xcite .",
    "of course , this does not constitute compelling evidence for more than one exotic state in this mass region . however , if we _",
    "assume _ that there are two @xmath122 states at 1280 and at 1380 mev respectively , then one expects the lower - mass state to have a substantial branching ratio into @xmath123 ( the reaction @xmath124 is mediated by @xmath125 exchange ) , whereas the higher - mass state would couple to the @xmath126 channel or perhaps to the @xmath127 channel ( the reaction @xmath128 is produced in part by the exchange of the pomeron ) .",
    "mass dependent fits of the @xmath71 and @xmath4 amplitudes and their relative phase using three different methods ( described above ) all lead to the conclusion that the @xmath4 wave is well - described by a resonance hypothesis and is inconsistent with having a constant phase .",
    "the resonance parameters for the observed @xmath72 are given by @xmath110  mev / c@xmath111 and @xmath129  mev / c@xmath83 . here",
    "the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
