    "periodic dielectric optical structures , known as photonic crystals ( pc ) , have been focus of intense research over the last four decades since yablonovitch @xcite and john @xcite investigated their capabilities to profoundly modify the local density of electromagnetic states ( ldos ) ; these works have served as inspiration to develop a detailed optical theory of pcs @xcite . in particular , pc slabs , which are practical two - dimensional pcs embedded in semiconductor dielectric membranes ,",
    "have become an excellent candidate for on - chip integration given their flexibility to tailor the confinement and propagation of light , aided by continuously improving fabrication techniques @xcite . a wide range of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) phenomena",
    "have been observed in pc slabs using quantum dots ( qds ) , in both weak and strong coupling regime @xcite , as have resonant interactions between several quantum emitters within pc slabs @xcite , with promising functionalities in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "rich optical non - linear phenomena have also been experimentally and theoretically addressed in these systems @xcite .    with regards to waveguide geometries , pc slab waveguides ( pcws )",
    "have attracted much attention as a platform for single photon generation @xcite , optical buffering @xcite , and for enhancing non - linear optical processes in the slow - light regime @xcite however , pcws are known to be extremely sensitive to fabrication disorder @xcite , which becomes relevant for practical applications @xcite .",
    "interestingly , structural disorder in pcs can also induce coherent scattering of light @xcite , giving rise to the formation of random cavities where the field can be strongly localized , leading to the quasi-1d anderson localization regime @xcite .",
    "currently , the anderson localization phenomenon have been intensively studied in pcws with potential applications on cavity - qed @xcite and lasing @xcite , especially near the photonic band - edge frequency region , where the density of photonic states ( dos ) become very sensitive to structural disorder @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the role of intentional or deliberate disorder has also been addressed in the literature @xcite with promising results for forming high-@xmath0 cavity modes @xcite ( where @xmath0 is the quality factor ) and transverse localization below the diffraction limit @xcite .    despite the relevance of the various model studies on disordered pcws , many of the numerically exact theoretical calculations are carried out by using two - dimensional models @xcite or even one - dimensional ones @xcite .",
    "this is manly due to the high computational cost required to solve large photonic structures in three - dimensional calculations , e.g. , 3d - fdtd calculations , and the statistical nature of the anderson phenomenon , where several realizations of the disordered system must be calculated to obtain accurate results .",
    "thus , the numerically easier ( faster ) two- and one - dimensional approaches allow one to carry out statistical analysis with moderate computational effort .",
    "nevertheless , these approaches are limited , and they can not quantify the out - of - plane losses , coming from coupling to modes above the slab light line , and the actual electric field value throughout the photonic structure can also be quite different .",
    "these two important quantities and the frequency spectrum of the system determine the quality factor , mode volume and purcell enhancement ( pe ) statistics , which , from our knowledge , have not been rigorously studied in three - dimensional models for large scale disordered pcws .",
    "yet , they are critically important in understanding the properties of such modes , especially for assessing how such modes couple to single quantum emitters such as qds .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present a fully three - dimensional bloch mode expansion method and a green function formalism to explicitly calculate the quality factor , mode volume and pe distributions of a disordered w1 pcw ; fabrication ( intrinsic ) and two models of intentional ( extrinsic ) disorder are considered in our calculations , including variations in hole radii as well as position .",
    "we find that the cavity - mode quality factor statistics is in general well described by log - normal distributions , as well as the pe statistics for moderate quantities of intentional disorder .",
    "the latter is a consequence of the dominant behaviour of @xmath0 over the pe given the small variation range of the mode volumes in comparison to the variation range of the quality factors .",
    "in particular , we show that the intensity of the emission enhancement is slightly larger in the @xmath1 projected direction ( waveguide direction ) than in the @xmath2 projected one ( perpendicular to the waveguide direction within the pc plane ) , which is due to the larger value of the @xmath3-polarized electric field component peak in comparison to the corresponding @xmath4 component .",
    "a decreasing exponential dependence of the mean quality factors and mean pe on the square root of the extrinsic disorder parameter is found , as well as for the standard deviation of the corresponding statistical distributions .",
    "finally , using our three - dimensional model , we also compute the probability of strong coupling between state - of - art qds and to the anderson - localized modes , and find the optimal spatial regions to maximize coupling of these quantum emitters in the pcw .",
    "a decreasing exponential dependence of the strong coupling probability on the squared extrinsic disorder parameter is seen , and such probability is found to be more robust against hole - position disorder than hole - size disorder .",
    "our theoretical results are of particular relevance to complement recent experimental works on probing the statistical properties of anderson localization @xcite , statistical measurements of purcell enhancements @xcite and cavity - qed @xcite .",

    "this approach is expected to be a good approximation when the real part of the eigenvalue is much larger than its imaginary part ( low - loss regime ) .",
    "the complex frequencies of the system are then approximately defined as @xmath27 , where the quality factor of the disordered photonic eigenmode is computed by @xmath28 .",
    "while such cavity modes are formally quasinormal modes @xcite , for high @xmath0 resonators , the effective mode volume defined earlier is expected to be an excellent approximation for the typical spatial domains we use @xcite .",

[ fig : purcell ] ) .",
    "we also note that the differences on the strong coupling probabilities for different values of @xmath113 at the same @xmath54 , decreases when @xmath54 increases , which is due to the dominant effect of @xmath128 ( low @xmath129 ) for large disorder .",

    "the latter is not however a great limitation given the state - of - art precision on quantum dot positioning ( around @xmath131  nm ) in modern nano - fabrication techniques @xcite ; and the resonant condition can be achieved by using the quantum confined stark effect @xcite in temperature - dependent measurements @xcite . in the insets of fig .",

    "we find that the mean effective mode volume of the anderson modes decreases with increasing small disorder degrees and increases with increasing large disorder degrees , displaying a lower bound as it was recently predicted for the localization length using two - dimensional calculations .",
    "such a behavior is seen to be more accentuated when disorder in the hole sizes is considered . by studying the functional dependence of the mean and standard deviation of the quality factor distributions on @xmath55 and @xmath51 , we have found that these statistical parameters decrease exponentially on the square root of the intentional disorder parameter .",

    "the mean values of the purcell enhancements found in this work , as a function of the extrinsic disorder parameter , represent upper bounds to the corresponding values that could be experimentally measured in the present system , for which lower bounds have already been addressed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the studied disorder regime , the statistics of the purcell enhancement is mainly determined by the quality factor distributions , which is verified by the same exponential dependence of the enhancement on the square root of the intentional disorder parameter . as a consequence of the @xmath0 dominant behaviour on the purcell enhancement",
    ", we have found that the purcell enhancement statistics is also well described by log - normal distributions .",
