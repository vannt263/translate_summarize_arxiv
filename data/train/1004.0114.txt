    "the value of @xmath2 preferred by current global analyses of ckm data is about 15% smaller than the one extracted from inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "though not very significant , the discrepancy has prompted a reexamination of the sources of theoretical uncertainty in the inclusive determination @xcite .",
    "weak annihilation ( wa ) contributions are generally considered an important source of uncertainty in the operator product expansion ( ope ) that describes the inclusive @xmath1 decays @xcite , and affect especially the high @xmath3 and lepton endpoint analyses .",
    "they appear in the ope as @xmath4 corrections involving the matrix elements of dimension-6 four - quark operators , and affect both the total @xmath5 decay rate and the charged lepton energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "early estimates of the relevant matrix elements were derived in the framework of qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "they were also computed on the lattice in the static heavy quark limit @xcite and with propagating heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized @xcite that the light flavour component of the wa operators can differ from the light valence quark of the @xmath1-meson leading to the so - called non - valence wa contributions which are extremely difficult to study non - perturbatively . in addition , contrary to valence wa contributions , the latter can not be constrained by comparing charged and neutral @xmath1 meson semileptonic decay rates and a common prejudice that the former should dominate may be unfounded .",
    "it was also noted in ref.@xcite that the wa matrix elements that enter @xmath5 decay can be constrained via the semileptonic decays of @xmath0 and @xmath6 mesons , using heavy quark symmetry .",
    "several authors have attempted to extract information on wa contributions from the measured total semileptonic rates of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , most recently in @xcite .",
    "for instance , one may attribute the observed differences in @xmath8 and @xmath6 semileptonic widths @xcite @xmath9 to the valence spectator quark wa contributions in @xmath6 decays , since they are cabibbo suppressed in the @xmath10 case and completely absent in @xmath11 decays .",
    "however , additional contributions to this difference arise from @xmath12 breaking in the matrix elements of all dimension 5 and 6 operators , that contribute significantly to the total rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , the slow convergence of the @xmath13 expansion , the generally large perturbative corrections to the semileptonic charm width , and the strong dependence on the charm mass may obscure the determination of the non - valence wa component from the widths .    our strategy in this paper is to consider also the moments of the lepton energy spectra in the ope and compare them with recent experimental results from cleo  @xcite . not only are the moments free of the strong dependence on the charm quark mass and its associated uncertainty , but their perturbative and non - perturbative corrections tend to cancel as well . moreover , since wa is expected to dominate the spectrum endpoint , leptonic moments might be more sensitive to wa contributions than the total rate .",
    "a study of moments in @xmath0 semileptonic decays is also instrumental for a critical reassessment of the ope in charm decays many years after @xcite , in view of the recent experimental results and of the successful application to @xmath1 semileptonic decays .    in the next section",
    ", we present the experimental results on the leptonic spectra and compute from them the first leptonic moments .",
    "the ope calculation of the moments is presented in section iii , while we derive and discuss our results in section iv .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "recently the cleo collaboration has measured the electron spectra of inclusive semileptonic @xmath8 and also @xmath6 decays with a lower cut on the electron momentum in the lab frame of @xmath14 gev @xcite .",
    "they extract the total decay rates by extrapolating the spectra over the remaining phase - space , using a theoretically modeled sum over known exclusive modes .",
    "unfortunately , they do not provide higher leptonic energy moments .     normalized charm semileptonic decay spectra @xcite , extrapolated to @xmath15 and boosted to the reference frame of the decaying particle . ]",
    "cleo give the electron energy spectra in the laboratory frame .",
    "since the decaying @xmath7 mesons are pair - produced with center - of - mass energy @xmath16 gev , they are boosted in this frame with @xmath17 , respectively . in the case of @xmath6 mesons ,",
    "the situation is more complicated since roughly half of them are produced in the primary vertex at @xmath18 gev associated with @xmath19 mesons ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the other half then comes from radiative and hadronic @xmath21 decays .",
    "we extract the moments without cuts by first extrapolating the measured spectra towards @xmath15 .",
    "we use a procedure similar to the one employed by cleo themselves , but instead of using a sum over exclusive modes with model form factors , we use the theoretical form of the spectrum in the @xmath22 region , where the ope is expected to provide a satisfactory description . in particular , for @xmath23 the spectrum must die at least like @xmath24 . thus we fit the first four measured bins to @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . in the case of @xmath6 , due to the larger statistical uncertainties , we set @xmath27 and fit only to the first two measured bins . in the fits we take the reported systematic errors to be fully correlated between different bins . using the fitted formulas we have computed the rates and obtained the following branching fractions @xmath28 fully compatible with",
    "cleo reported results .",
    "we then compute in the lab frame the first two leptonic energy moments normalized to the total rate , again assuming the systematic errors to be fully correlated among different bins and obtain @xmath29 the dependence of these values upon our extrapolation ansatz is expected to be smaller than the corresponding effect in the total rate , since the contribution of the @xmath30 region to the @xmath31-th ( unnormalized ) moment is @xmath32 suppressed compared to its contribution to the total rate .",
    "thanks to the correlations between numerators and denominators , the total errors in ( [ eq : lab ] ) are significantly smaller than in ( [ eq : br ] ) .    in order to compare these values to theoretical predictions in the @xmath0 meson frame one",
    "still needs to take into account the boost factors .",
    "the energy of the final state electron in the lab frame is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electron energy in the @xmath0 meson frame and @xmath35 is the angle between the momentum of the electron and the one of the @xmath0 meson in the lab frame . we thus obtain that @xmath36 with @xmath37 for cleo s @xmath8 mesons , respectively .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath38 of @xmath6 s which come from the primary vertex , @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining @xmath40 receive an additional boost in an arbitrary direction since they originate from @xmath19 decays @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) or @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . in view of the precision in ( [ eq : lab ] ) , the effect of this additional boost is always negligible .",
    "the directional averaging for the second electron energy moment @xmath45 results in @xmath46 which again can be readily computed for all cases .",
    "the extrapolated rest - frame spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "our results for the moments in the @xmath0 mesons rest frame are @xmath47 here we have also listed the variances ( @xmath48 ) of the spectra . within the stated uncertainties there is no sign of a difference between the moments of @xmath6 and @xmath49 .",
    "this is at odds with what one would naively expect from eq.([eq : cleo - c ] ) .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , the concurring contribution of su(3 ) violation in the matrix elements of higher dimensional operators might provide a partial explanation .",
    "one can estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath12 breaking corrections by comparing the hyperfine splitting of @xmath7 and @xmath6 mesons , @xmath50 ( which is related to the ope parameter @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 we see that even isospin violation between @xmath8 mesons is manifest , at the expected @xmath53 level . on the other hand @xmath12 violation",
    "is sizable and of the order @xmath54 .",
    "lattice qcd studies of @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite suggest that even 20% violation can be expected in certain quantities . since the @xmath57 and @xmath58 contributions to the total semileptonic rate can be as large as @xmath59 of the leading order estimate ( depending on the charm quark scheme and scale ) , and since one can expect @xmath12 violation of similar size in the matrix elements of the relevant power suppressed operators , an @xmath60 @xmath12 breaking in the widths is not unlikely . in order to reliably extract possible",
    "wa contributions from the measured total semileptonic rates of @xmath0 and @xmath6 mesons @xcite , one would therefore need to estimate the size of @xmath12 violation in all these matrix elements . in the case of normalized moments , on the other hand , some of the leading power corrections cancel out and one might be more directly sensitive to wa contributions .",
    "the perturbative corrections to moments of some kinematic distributions in semileptonic @xmath61 decays are now known through @xmath62 @xcite . in the case of semileptonic",
    "charm decays , however , only the @xmath63 @xcite and @xmath64 corrections are readily available using @xcite . for what concerns the power corrections , explicit expressions for the leptonic spectrum at @xmath65 can be found in the last paper of @xcite , while we have computed the @xmath66 contributions from the form factors given in @xcite .",
    "we neglect @xmath67 corrections @xcite and @xmath68 corrections , for which only the @xmath69 contribution to the rate is known .",
    "we calculate the semileptonic rate and the total moments from the lepton energy spectra in terms of @xmath70 , where @xmath34 is the electron energy in the @xmath0 meson inertial frame . for simplicity ,",

    "@xmath76 is the wa contribution to the @xmath31-moment : as we will explain in a moment , it is related to the matrix elements of four - quark operators .",
    "in addition , there are also cabibbo suppressed contributions , which can be included in the analysis by using the above formula in the limit @xmath77 and by replacing @xmath78 with @xmath79 and similarly @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "they contribute to the total rate at the level of 5% , but their effect is highly suppressed in the normalized moments , with the possible exception of wa contributions .",
    "the tree - level spectrum in charm semileptonic decays is softer than in the analogous @xmath61 decays and peaks at @xmath82 , a feature qualitatively evident already in fig .  1 .",
    "the lowest order expressions for the rate and the first two moments read @xmath83/5\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ f_0^{(2 ) } & = [ -r^6 + 8r^5 - 30r^4 + 80r^3 - 35r^2 - 60r^2\\log r - 24 r + 2]/5\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the associated @xmath63 corrections are known in closed form only for the total rate .",
    "we employ accurate numerical interpolations valid in the range @xmath84 in the pole mass scheme @xmath85 similarly , while there is an analytic result for @xmath86 as an expansion in @xmath87 @xcite , we employ only the blm approximation @xcite in the form of numerical interpolations in the pole mass scheme : @xmath88   \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(1)}_{2}(r ) & = \\beta_0   [ 6.15 \\sqrt r - 0.35 r \\log r - 2.24]\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ f^{(2)}_{2}(r ) & = \\beta_0   [ 4.99 \\sqrt r + 0.11 r \\log r - 1.64]\\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the qcd beta function @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the number of light flavors .",
    "the above expressions can be translated to any other scheme ( and associated ir scale ) using the condition that the decay rate be scheme ( and scale ) independent at each perturbative order together with the known scale dependence of the heavy quark mass and power suppressed non - perturbative parameters . for the leading power corrections",
    "we get @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath94 renormalization scale associated to the mixing of the darwin and wa operators , an @xmath95 effect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath93 dependence cancels against the implicit scale dependence of @xmath96 .",
    "a change of @xmath93 therefore shifts part of the darwin operator contribution into the wa contribution , with important consequences for the error analysis .",
    "we find that for values of @xmath93 below 1gev the size of the @xmath97 coefficient in the width is comparable to that of other power corrections .",
    "wa contributions can be identified with the matrix elements of the dimension-6 four quark operators @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the heavy quark .",
    "the matrix elements that enter the charm meson decay rates are defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 parameterize the deviation from the factorization approximation : @xmath102 vanishes in the limit of factorization . as it was recognized long ago",
    "@xcite , wa is localized at the endpoint of the lepton energy spectrum , and can be approximately expressed by a delta function at the partonic endpoint . in this case , we would expect @xmath103 , for all @xmath31 , up to small @xmath104 effects .",
    "in fact , gluon bremsstrahlung and hadronization effects are expected to smear the wa contribution over a region of electron energy around the partonic threshold @xmath105 corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "the size and shape of the smearing may affect the various integrals @xmath107 differently and can not be predicted , although we expect a small perturbative tail to emerge away from the endpoint . clearly , smearing towards smaller",
    "@xmath34 tends to suppress the wa contributions to higher lepton energy moments , in which case we expect @xmath108 .",
    "we also know that the wa contributions involve a @xmath12 flavor singlet in the final state , and may be confined below the two - pion or @xmath109 thresholds which , for @xmath0 decays and @xmath110gev , correspond to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . for @xmath6",
    "decays the allowed region is slightly larger .",
    "indeed , the wa distributions spread over a region of electron energies of @xmath113 . in fig .",
    "2 we show four possible forms of the wa distribution as a function of @xmath114 , assuming only positivity and the presence of a tail towards lower @xmath114 .",
    "two of the forms displayed stop at the @xmath109 threshold , the other two extend to the two - pion threshold .",
    "the endpoint behavior of wa can also be parameterized in terms of matrix elements of local four - quark operators of higher and higher dimension @xcite , which determine the wa distribution . at leading order in the heavy quark expansion ,",
    "however , the parameters @xmath115 , i.e.  the total moments of the wa distribution , are all determined by the dimension six term , and therefore they are all equal to @xmath116 .",
    "the smearing is therefore a power and @xmath117-suppressed effect in @xmath115 , but it may be phenomenologically important despite the formal suppression",
    ".    we will be primarily interested in a determination of the leading matrix element , @xmath116 , i.e.  the zeroth moment of the wa distribution , from @xmath115 : the non - negligible smearing of wa may lead to a model - dependent dilution . in order to quantify this effect on the parameters @xmath118 , we have considered a number of distributions like those in fig .  2 .",
    "in general the dilution is a moderate effect : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and of course for wa distributions localized to the right of the partonic endpoint , @xmath121 .",
    "however , distributions characterized by a longer tail will lead to a stronger dilution , which may also be enhanced in the normalized moments . in the next section , when we try to extract information on the wa from the leptonic moments , we will carefully take this effect into account .",
    "different distributions of wa as a function of @xmath26 , for @xmath110gev .",
    "the distributions extend to @xmath122 corresponding to the @xmath109 threshold , or to @xmath123 , corresponding to the @xmath124 threshold for @xmath8 . ]",
    "the wa contributions to the decays of charmed mesons involving different spectator quarks can be parametrically decomposed as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the cabibbo angle . in the isospin limit",
    ", the number of independent contributions is reduced by the identification @xmath127 . any difference in the moments between the @xmath11 and",
    "the @xmath10 can only be due to isospin violation or cabibbo suppressed contributions .",
    "since the data do not show any significant difference in the rates or the moments of @xmath11 and @xmath10 in what follows we will neglect such cabibbo suppressed effects .",
    "we are then left with just two distinct contributions , which can be identified with the valence and non - valence wa terms involving the @xmath128 quark .",
    "the first one , @xmath129 , only contributes to the @xmath6 decays , while the second one , @xmath130 , contributes equally to @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays . in the flavor @xmath12 limit",
    ", the two contributions correspond to the sum of isotriplet and isosinglet , and to the isosinglet contribution , respectively .",

    "@xcite reports a very precise value in the @xmath94 scheme which is consistent with @xcite .",
    "however , any scheme translation would increase the error significantly . in the end",
    ", we do not expect an improvement even in the case of the width .",
    "in addition , we assume that the large uncertainty on @xmath154 as extracted from the @xmath1 fit dominates over the perturbative and non - perturbative corrections to its value . in the case of @xmath51 , on the other hand , we use a conservative approach with the central value of @xcite and a large error @xmath160gev@xmath161 . for the strange quark",

    "we have also repeated our analysis using the 1s scheme for the charm mass @xcite and @xmath172 for the other ope parameters .",
    "the apparent convergence of the perturbative expansion improves for the rate and variance , but the estimates and errors of the wa contributions are very similar .",

    "we regard this as sufficiently conservative .",
    "we can also extract @xmath181 from @xmath182 : in the absence of wa smearing they both give the same result , @xmath183 , while the worst dilution scenario gives @xmath184 , which is compatible with the value extracted from the ratio of widths .",
    "we can also look for indications of wa dilution by extracting @xmath185 from a combined fit to the moments and the total rates ( recall that @xmath186 are linear combinations of @xmath185 ) .",

    "this may be viewed as a mild indication that there is no significant wa dilution , or possibly that the dilution is similar in the three cases . indeed , assuming vanishing wa at @xmath133gev all the moments can be reproduced by @xmath191gev@xmath179 .",

    "the non - valence contribution , on the other hand , has a tiny error and should be compared with @xmath210 that we extract from the widths only , see eq .",
    "the difference is presumably due to various sources : @xmath211 the charm mass that we employ is higher than that employed in @xcite : we start with the result of the global fit @xcite , which is in excellent agreement with other @xmath141 determinations like charmonium sum rules , and evolve it to lower @xmath170 ; @xmath212 our ope parameters ( taken from @xcite and then evolved to lower @xmath170 ) are different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which may lead to sizable differences in charm but not in bottom decays ; @xmath213 the method of @xcite implies the use of @xmath214 , and might underestimate the perturbative corrections .",
    "the discrepancy between the two determinations provides indeed additional motivation for using the moments to constrain wa , as they are less sensitive to power and perturbative corrections . in any case",
    ", we find remarkable that our determination from the moments is compatible with that from the widths and relatively stable wrt changes in the definition of the charm mass or in @xmath170 .",
    "notice also that despite the larger value of @xmath215 they find , the authors of @xcite end up with an estimate for the wa effects in the @xmath204 rate which is very similar to ours , once the enhancement related to eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) is taken into account .",
    "this is because our large uncertainty almost covers the discrepancy in the central values .",
    "we have performed an analysis of inclusive semileptonic @xmath0 decays using the heavy quark expansion .",
    "in addition to the total widths , we have used the cleo data on the lepton energy spectra to compute the first few moments .",
    "the latter are quite sensitive probes of possible weak annihilation contributions , both in its isosinglet and isotriplet components , and determine very precisely a linear combination of the expectation values of the darwin and wa operators .",
    "we have shown that the extraction of wa from the moments depends to the way wa is distributed in the lepton energy spectrum and we have taken this effect into account in our error estimates .",
    "our analysis of cleo data shows no evidence for weak annihilation , i.e.  the ope describes well the experimental results even in the absence of wa .",
    "there is a mild indication of non - zero valence wa in the ratio of the @xmath6 and @xmath11 widths , but it does not seem to be supported by the ratio of the lepton moments in @xmath6 and @xmath11 decays .",
    "a possible explanation involves sizable @xmath12 breaking in the matrix elements of the power suppressed operators and/or a wa contribution which is broadly distributed over the leptonic spectrum .",
    "we derive an upper limit on both valence and non - valence wa components , which allows us to put a bound of 2% on their relevance in the @xmath192 decay rate and even less for the isotriplet component .",
    "we look forward to the individual measurements of the @xmath216 and @xmath217 charmless inclusive semileptonic decays , which could test our conclusions regarding the suppression of valence wa in these decays .",
    "finally we note that the hadronic mass and @xmath3 moments in inclusive semileptonic decays of heavy quarks are quite sensitive to non - perturbative contributions , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "their measurement at cleo - c or at the recently started besiii experiment  @xcite might help us disentangle the various non - perturbative effects .",
