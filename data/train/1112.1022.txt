    "processes of central exclusive production ( cep ) became recently a very active field of research ( ref .",
    "although the attention is paid mainly to high-@xmath9 processes that can be used for new physics searches ( exclusive higgs , @xmath10 interactions , etc . ) , measurements of low-@xmath9 signals are also very important as they can help to constrain models of the backgrounds for the former ones .",

    "the @xmath15 reaction is a natural background for exclusive production of resonances decaying into @xmath14 channel , such as : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the mass spectrum of the exclusive @xmath18 system at the cern intersecting storage rings ( isr ) was measured at @xmath19 gev @xcite and at @xmath20 gev @xcite ( this is the highest energy at which normalized experimental data exist ) .",
    "recently there was interest in central exclusive production of heavy resonance states ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) where the qcd mechanism is similar to the exclusive production of the higgs boson .",
    "we recall that the cdf measurement of @xmath21 cep @xcite is based on the detection of the decay @xmath22 with @xmath23 channel . at the tevatron",
    "the experimental invariant mass resolution @xmath24 does not allow a separation of the different @xmath25 states .",
    "therefore , although the cross section for exclusive @xmath6 production obtained within the @xmath8-factorization @xcite should be the largest among @xmath26 states , the higher spin @xmath27 and @xmath28 states could give similar contributions to the observed @xmath29 decay channel , because of their much higher branching fractions @xcite .",
    "the observation of @xmath6 cep via two - body decay channels is of special interest for studying the dynamics of heavy quarkonia production .",

    "recently we have analyzed a possibility to measure @xmath6 via its decay to the @xmath31 channel .",
    "the branching fraction to this channel is relatively larger for scalar meson than for the tensor meson @xcite ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and even absent for the axial meson .",

    "our results show that the @xmath42-rescattering leads rather to an enhancement of the cross section compared to the calculation without @xmath42-rescattering .",
    "the camel - like shape of the rapidity distribution is due to the interference of different components in the amplitude . while the pomeron - pomeron exchanges peak at midrapidity the pomeron - reggeon ( reggeon - pomeron ) exchanges peak at backward ( forward )",
