    "ever since the discovery of black hole ( bh ) evaporation @xcite it has been evident that quantum processes involving a bh can exhibit quite unusual properties . in particular , it is not clear whether such a basic property of the @xmath0-matrix as unitarity can be preserved if bhs are present in intermediate states . at the present level of understanding of quantum general relativity",
    "it seems quite impossible to give a satisfactory description of such processes in the framework of full four - dimensional theory .",
    "therefore , the study of simplified models is so important , among which spherically reduced einstein gravity ( srg ) is the physically most relevant one . some important information can be collected already at the classical limit . due to the progress in computer simulations",
    "the understanding of spherically symmetric collapse of classical matter towards a bh has reached a remarkable level @xcite .",
    "that collapse is governed by a critical threshold which even allows a simplified discussion in terms of self - similar solutions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has already been conjectured @xcite that for ( in @xmath1 ) minimally coupled matter ( i.e.  not properly restricted to its s - wave part ) this critical behaviour is absent , i.e.  a bh is produced by an arbitrarily small amount of matter .",
    "one approach to obtain the quantum version of such processes is the use of dirac quantization for suitably defined operators which describe the collapse of matter .",
    "a very popular model in this context is the study of thin spherical shells . using the kucha decomposition @xcite , especially for null ( lightlike ) shells important",
    "progress has been made recently @xcite .",
    "we should also mention some earlier papers @xcite where the problem of physical states in dilaton gravity without matter was addressed .",
    "although certain aspects of the correspondence between physical states and bhs could be clarified , the application of these results to the quantum @xmath0 matrix for matter fields was not possible in the framework of the reduced phase space formalism .    from the point of view of usual quantum field theory",
    "the path integral approach seems the most natural one .",
    "there ( properly defined ) s - matrix elements directly determine the `` physical observables '' , which in the dirac approach are  in the opinion of the present authors  not so easily to be extracted from the `` dirac observables '' . during the last years",
    "the path integral quantization of general 2d gravity theories , including srg coupled to matter , has shown considerable progress @xcite .",
    "based upon the ( global and local ) dynamical equivalence of ( torsionless ) dilaton theories with first order 2d gravity in cartan variables ( with nonvanishing torsion ) it turned out that the 2d geometry can be integrated much more easily , if a specific gauge , the `` light - cone '' gauge for the cartan variables @xcite is chosen .",
    "the 2d metric corresponding to this gauge coincides with the eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) metric which has the advantage of avoiding coordinate singularities at an eventual horizon . as shown in @xcite the explicit one loop contributions in the generating functional",
    "originate from the gaussian integral of the scalars and from the `` back reaction '' due to the scalars through the covariant measure .",
    "our present work concentrates on the classical part of this functional , i.e.  on the zero loop order ( tree approximation ) in terms of the scalar matter fields .",
    "clearly here features similar to the ones in classical collapse can be expected , although those `` macroscopic '' effects could well be modified at the `` microscopic '' level , when we refer in the latter case , say , to the scattering of individual scalar quanta in 2d gravity theory .",
    "as will be shown , these effects are indeed present , emerging naturally _ without any further ad hoc assumptions _ from the 2d quantum gravity formalism .    in order to make this evident we shortly review the main arguments of the latter in section 2 , generalizing it to the case of massive scalars .",
    "the classical vertex of scalar fields is extracted in section 3 .",
    "the problems arising for the scattering amplitude from our restriction to minimally coupled massless and massive scalars are discussed in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the total action @xmath2 consists of a geometric part which is most conveniently written in first order form involving cartan variables @xmath3 \\quad , \\\\ { \\label}{lfirstb } { \\cal{v}}&=&x^+x^-u(x ) + v(x ) \\quad \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the torsion two form ,",

    "our conventions are determined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",

    "for the quantum theory  as well as for the much simplified treatment of the exact classical solutions to ( [ lfirst ] ) or ( [ lbegin ] )  the use of the eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) gauge @xmath27 has been found to be useful .",

    "note that integration over @xmath51 from ( [ a3 ] ) produces another factor @xmath52 so that the total faddeev - popov determinant is one  a result consistent with experience from yang - mills fields in temporal gauges like ( [ gauge - fix ] ) .",

    "homogeneous modes always appear when we invert the operator @xmath55 .",
    "such modes @xmath56 must be included in @xmath46 where they completely describe the ( eventual ) classical background @xcite .",

    "both contributions to the total matrix element can be integrated completely yielding distributions .",
    "some details of the calculation are described in appendix a.    for `` incoming '' momenta @xmath228 with energies @xmath249 and outgoing ones @xmath229 with @xmath250 , taking into account symmetries and ensuing factors we obtain from ( [ 63 ] ) @xmath251   { \\label}{68 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath252 where the sum extends over @xmath253 each taking the values @xmath254 . with the abbreviations @xmath255 ) @xmath256 the quantity @xmath257 is given by @xmath258 the logarithms of complex arguments are defined as usual , i.e. : @xmath259    the final result for the second contribution ( [ 61 ] ) inserted in ( [ 63 ] ) has a similar structure : @xmath260 { \\label}{72 } \\\\ v & : = & v^{(1)}+v^{(2 ) } { \\label}{73 } \\\\",

    "both terms also share the energy conservation factor .",
    "therefore , only a probability per unit of time with factor @xmath267 is a well defined quantity .",
    "the situation with respect to momenta is different because of the nonlocality of the vertex .",
    "thus we encounter a situation similar to scattering at a fixed external `` potential '' in ordinary quantum mechanics ( or , equivalently , in @xmath268 dimensional qft ) .",
    "it should be noted that in the infrared limit both amplitudes are proportional to @xmath269 and hence vanish for the massless case in agreement with the previous discussion . for large energies . ]",
    "the amplitudes decrease rapidly : @xmath270",
    "two dimensional path integral quantum gravity can now be based upon a well - defined formalism which  in a very specific gauge  allows to separate the exact , almost trivial , quantum integral of the geometric variables from the loop - wise effects of the scalars . in our present work we considered the classical , tree - approximation , limit for minimally interacting scalar fields @xmath0 , starting from the path integral formalism .",
    "this implies the appearance of effective ( classical ) @xmath94-vertices of scalar fields ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "those vertices are highly nontrivial , because they yield  through the natural appearance of classical background phenomena  mathematical structures which allow the interpretation that an intermediate `` virtual '' bh is involved .",
    "we have studied this for the geometric action as derived by spherically reducing einstein gravity .",
    "the scalar matter field was assumed to be coupled minimally at the @xmath272 level .",
    "we also concentrated upon the simplest nontrivial vertex @xmath125 with four scalar fields .",
    "for the massless case we found that the resulting nonlocal matrix element for unrestricted left- and right - moving scalar fields diverges as @xmath273 at that point in space - time which can be identified with the `` location '' of a singularity .",
    "however , imposing a suitable boundary condition upon @xmath0 completely eliminates the scalar excitation moving towards the singularity , whereas the ones moving away decouple from the theory : the manifold has been `` plugged '' at the place where an eventual bh may have been formed .",
    "we believe that this result at the particle level shows a qualitative relation to a conjecture for macroscopic bh formation : there for minimally coupled scalars a bh forms without any threshold @xcite .",
    "the divergence of a probability amplitude or , alternatively , an amplitude which is finite only for a wave packet , properly rescaled to tend to zero width at @xmath274 , seems to imply the same phenomenon .    as an example for a system where",
    "finite amplitudes for minimally coupled scalars can be obtained we also studied massive scalars , where the necessary boundary condition no longer prevents bh effects . both , the vertex from the massless case , and another new one , induced by the mass - term , yield finite results which can be even represented by ( complicated ) sums of directions ( plus or minus ) of momenta in terms of ( simple ) functions and distributions .",
    "overall energy conservation holds in the process @xmath164 .",
    "momenta are not conserved , in general . here",
    "we note parallels to recent work of p. hjek @xcite on massless , but non - minimally coupled thin spherical shells .",
    "he found no residual bh for a collapsing shell with dirac quantization .",
    "also in that work the phenomenon has been observed which we have called `` virtual bh '' , consisting in a certain sense of a black and a white hole .",
    "the next task @xcite is to take into account also the proper nonminimal coupling of scalars at the @xmath69 level .",
    "superficially no essential basic changes for the vertices may be expected : on the one hand , the measure of the integral will change as @xmath275 , because @xmath276 will become a radial variable . on the other hand the scalar field",
    "will be reduced to the one describing @xmath152-waves in @xmath277 , i.e.  @xmath278 .",
    "but e.g.  the threshold effect known for macroscopic studies @xcite should show up . in that case",
    "a detailed comparison with dirac quantization as treated in @xcite will be possible .",
    "our formalism is general enough so that any other 2d gravity theory , produced e.g.  by spherical reduction of generalized einstein gravities in @xmath279 , can be covered as well .",
    "of course , also the study of higher loop orders in the scalar fields , based upon the one - loop determinant ( polyakov type action ) in the path integral , as well as of higher loops involving the vertices discussed here , together with propagators of the scalars , remains a wide field of possible further applications .",
    "the authors thank their colleagues at the institute for theoretical physics of the vienna university of technology for many discussions .",
    "this paper has been supported by project p-12815-tph of the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) .",
    "one of the authors ( d.v . ) has been supported in part by the alexander von humboldt foundation and by rfbr , grant 97 - 01 - 01186 .",
    "the explicit computation of the scattering amplitude @xmath246 in ( [ 68 ] ) and @xmath280 in ( [ 72 ] ) for minkowski modes in the initial and final state is most conveniently based upon suitable fourier transforms of the rational factors in @xmath281 and @xmath282 in ( [ 60 ] ) and ( [ 61 ] ) . from the identity",

    "furthermore in ( [ 68 ] ) it is useful to replace the factor @xmath293 by a third derivative with respect to @xmath294 .",
    "then the generic integral @xmath295 remains which after three differentiations with respect to @xmath296 in @xmath297 becomes a contribution of integrals with one logarithm multiplied by a factor with two or three poles .",
