    "the x - ray source cyg  x-1  was discovered by a rocket flight in 1964 ( @xcite ) . in march 1971 the sudden appearance of an accurately locateable radio source coinciding with a change in the luminosity of the x - ray source led to its identification with the o9.7  iab supergiant hde  226868 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this star is known as part of a single lined spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 5.6 days at a distance of about 2.5kpc .",
    "the x - ray emission of cyg  x-1 is produced by the accretion of material from the supergiant primary onto the compact object . according to , the most probable masses of the binary partners are 18m@xmath1 for the primary and 10m@xmath1 for the compact object , which is one of the most firmly established black hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "the accretion process is believed to be fueled by a focused stellar wind from hde  226868 ( @xcite ) .    during most of the time cyg",
    "x-1 is emitting a non - thermal or hard state spectrum ( for the soft state , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which can be described by a power - law with a photon - index @xmath21.5 - 1.7 , modified by an exponential cutoff with a folding energy of about 150kev and reprocessing features .",
    "this spectral form can be interpreted as being due to an accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the short - term variability of the x - ray emission has been studied in order to gain better insight into the physical processes at work near the compact object .",
    "cyg  x-1  was the first source for which x - ray variability on timescales @xmath31s was detected ( @xcite ) . for a long time",
    "this variability was suspected to be a special black hole signature , but today we know that x - ray binaries containing a neutron star instead of a black hole can display similar behavior ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the efforts in trying to identify a bhc by its irregular short - term variability are continuing ( @xcite ) .",
    "until now , no special process could be determined that describes all the properties of the observed short - term variability .",
    "we define `` variability on short timescales '' as variability faster than a few 100s , with emphasis on timescales @xmath31s .",
    "these rapid fluctuations are usually described in terms of shot noise models .",
    "it has become clear , however , that in the framework of applying conventional shot noise models , complex shot profiles or distributions of shot durations and amplitudes have to be assumed to explain the observations ( @xcite ) . shot noise processes exhibit a fixed dynamical behavior in the sense that if the shots are given , no new dynamical information is produced during the run of the poisson distributed point process . only by the summation of individual shots",
    "the temporal correlations in the time series of the process are generated ( sect .",
    "[ kapitel2.3 ] ) .",
    "we use the alternative method of applying linear state space models ( lssms ) which are based on stochastic processes ( i.e. autoregressive ( ar ) processes , @xcite ) to describe the time series variability . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the process are produced using a different approach : each value of the time series refers to earlier values , with their temporal correlation being determined by the dynamical parameters of the system ( sect .",
    "[ kapitel3.1 ] ) .    the time series of a standard shot noise ( exponential decay with one relaxation timescale ) and an ar process of first order might look very similar , although the underlying processes differ .",
    "the similarity in the time domain leads to shot noise and ar processes both exhibiting an exponentially decaying autocorrelation function ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the similarity of the time series , however , the theoretical frequency spectra are different ( cf .  eq .  [ pshn ] and [ plss ] ) . whereas shot noise profiles with varying relaxation timescales have to be added to approximate the observed periodogram ( @xcite ) , only one dynamical ar parameter is needed to reproduce its properties ( sect .",
    "[ kapitel3.3 ] and  [ kapitel4.1 ] ) .",
    "we have studied the high time resolution exosat me lightcurves of cyg  x-1 . the data are presented in sect .",
    "[ kapitel2.1 ] .",
    "a commonly used method to analyze x - ray variability is to work in the frequency domain by fitting theoretical power spectra to the periodogram of a lightcurve : the periodogram of cyg  x-1  and the power spectra of the usually applied shot noise models are reviewed in sect .",
    "[ kapitel2.2 ] and [ kapitel2.3 ] , respectively .",
    "our analysis of the lightcurves with lssms , however , is not based on fitting the periodogram but on an alternative procedure working in the time domain .",
    "[ kapitel3 ] deals with the theory of the lssm analysis .",
    "our results are presented in sect .",
    "[ kapitel4 ] , and in sect .",
    "[ kapitel5 ] a possible explanation for the derived relaxation timescale is discussed combining the temporal lssm results and simulations of comptonized radiation using an accretion disk corona model for cyg  x-1 .",
    "the exosat raw data have been stored on _ final observation tapes _ ( fots ) and are now available at the _ heasarc _ archive .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the fot observations of cyg  x-1  that we have analyzed with linear state space models .",
    "we have chosen the me datastreams provided by the primary timing telemetry modes htr3 und her6 .",
    "these observations only contain events registered in the argon counters ( 120kev ) .",
    "the lightcurves are given as countrates normalized to one half of the detector array ( i.e.  four argon counters ) .",
    "using the _ interactive analysis _ ( ia ) software , we extracted lightcurves corrected for dead - time effects and collimator efficiency ( for an overview of the ia see @xcite ) . for the purpose of this paper",
    "an explicit background subtraction is not necessary since the lssm is implicitly modeling the measurement process ( see sect .",
    "[ kapitel3.2 ] , eq .",
    "[ lssm2 ] ) .    .exosat me observations that have been analyzed with lssms . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath4 number of the observation following the notation of table  [ tab1 ] ; @xmath5 average over the mean countrates of the 100 lightcurve segments and its standard deviation ( [ counts / sec / half ] ) .",
    "since the observations provide consistent results , all 900 values for @xmath0 can be combined , in order to arrive at a distribution with better statistics ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "note , that this non - gaussian distribution , resulting from the maximum likelihood estimation of @xmath0 , can not be described analytically ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , simulations have shown that the distribution of @xmath0 is contaminated by bad fit results at its `` high @xmath0 end '' due to numerical effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 can be expected to overestimate the `` true '' relaxation timescale of cyg  x-1 , whereas the most probable value @xmath7 should be a better estimator .",
    "we have shown that the short - term variability of the exosat me lightcurves of cyg  x-1  can be well described by a linear state space model of first order , i.e.  the dynamics of the system can be modeled as an autoregressive process with one temporal parameter  the relaxation timescale @xmath0 .",
    "we find @xmath0 to be ( 0.19@xmath80.03)s for the me energy - range .",
    "the relaxator is not found to be correlated either with time nor with the luminosity of the source , indicating that the physical process producing the emitted radiation is very stable and suggesting that the short - term variability is independent of the mass accretion rate of the system .",
    "the lssm analysis in the time domain allows us to estimate the fraction of the countrate that is due to observation - noise . when analyzing the periodogram in the frequency domain this white noise component",
    "can only be represented by a constant whose extraction is not trivial ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the problem of spectral leakage that has to be delt with in the frequency domain , is circumvented by fitting in the time domain . for these reasons our lssm analysis delivers results with higher statistical significance than corresponding frequency domain fits ( @xcite ) .",
    "these lssm[1 ] results allow a much simpler description of hard state short - term variability than multi - timescale shot noise models .",
    "although a detailed quantitative comparison is beyond the scope of this paper , the reproduction of the periodogram by the lssm[1 ] ( compared to its approximation by adding shot - profiles with different timescales , corrected for observation - noise and binning ) as well as the greater sensitivity of the lssm fitting procedure ( compared to frequency domain fits , which are usually used to evaluate shot noise models ) suggest that lssm[1]s are better suited to describe the nature of the observed variability .",
    "the lssms can model the different realizations of a stochastic relaxator @xmath0 , whereas shot noise models are generally restricted by the definition of special shot forms . shot noise lightcurves therefore might be regarded as a subclass of lssm lightcurves in the sense that a superposition of exponentially decaying shots can be interpreted as _",
    "one _ possible realization of an intrinsic ar[1 ] process .",
    "the inspection of the measured lightcurves of cyg  x-1 implies that the source of the derived ar[1 ] process is indeed the stochastic superposition of individual shot events , corresponding to the basic idea of shot noise .",
    "we note that on larger timescales this kind of variability is also present in the x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for such a temporal behavior , however , is not yet understood .",
    "recently , the discussion concerning accretion physics has begun to concentrate on the consideration of timing and spectral properties of the x - ray emission as two aspects of the same model ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the spectrum of both , agn and the hard state of galactic black hole candidates , is usually explained by inverse comptonization , where soft x - ray photons , provided by a cold accretion disk , are upscattered by inverse compton collisions in a hot plasma to produce the observed high energy power - law .    in this context",
    "it can be assumed that the observed x - ray temporal behavior is the result of the processing of short shots of seed photons within the accretion disk corona ( @xcite ) . the initial photon pulse is hardened and temporally broadened while diffusing through the corona . as harder photons in the emerging spectrum have , on average , undergone more scattering events , they have stayed in the corona for a longer time than softer photons and the emerging pulse is comparatively broader ( observed in agn by @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , variability structures in high energy lightcurves exhibit a characteristic time - lag with respect to those in low energy lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "frequency - dependent time - lags have e.g.  been observed in _ ginga _ and rxte observations of cyg  x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the question to what extent these lags are produced in a hot corona or wether they are intrinsic properties of the cold disk is still unresolved ( @xcite ) .",
    ", however , show that the frequency - dependent time - lags of cyg  x-1 can be qualitatively reproduced using a simple propagation model ( but they also point out that the longest observed time - lags ( @xmath90.1sec ) can probably not be explained by comptonization ) .",
    "another challenge for combined spectral and temporal theories is given by modelling the coherence of variability structures in different energy bands which is observed to be near unity over a large frequency range in cyg  x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional support for the time - dependent comptonization model comes from the joint spectral and temporal analysis of agn , which have similar properties to those of cyg  x-1 . for a sample of agn observations we were able to show that a linear correlation between the photon index @xmath10 and the lssm[1 ] timescale @xmath0 exists , in the sense that harder spectra have a longer variability timescale ( @xcite ) . by comparing the observed @xmath10-@xmath0 relation with monte carlo simulations of time - dependent comptonization models ,",
    "it is possible to scale the model geometry ( @xcite ) . for the hard - state galactic black hole candidates a similar study",
    "can not be performed since not enough objects are known . what can be done , however ,",
    "is to check whether our best - fit lssm models for cyg  x-1 could , at least roughly , be explained with a time - dependent comptonization model .    we have computed shot profiles for several possible accretion geometries using a linear monte carlo code .",
    "the detailed results of these simulations will be discussed elsewhere . since shot noise can be regarded as a special representation of an ar[1 ] process ( see sect .",
    "[ kapitel5.1 ] ) , we can use the computed shots to generate lightcurves based on these profiles , including an additional white noise component .",
    "in analogy to our treatment of the distribution of @xmath0 seen in the observations , we derive a most probable value for @xmath0 from the simulated lightcurve samples , @xmath11 .",
    "we find @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the radius of the corona .",
    "the profile of a compton - shot only depends on the relative size of the system , parameterized by the light travel time through one radius of the spherical corona , @xmath14 . by identifying @xmath11 with the measured value of @xmath150.19s ,",
    "it is therefore possible to express the measured @xmath0 in terms of the coronal radius .",
    "our simulations give a first estimate of 320640 schwarzschild radii for the coronal radius ( assuming a mass of 10@xmath16 for the black hole ) .",
    "other authors estimate the size of the comptonization cloud in the hard state to be @xmath9100 schwarzschild radii ( @xcite , adafs ) or @xmath923 schwarzschild radii ( @xcite , from minimal time - lags ) .",
    "these values are only in rough agreement and a better understanding of the relation between spectral and temporal properties is needed to arrive at a consistent picture .",
    "we plan a more detailed study of the compton - shot profiles as well as lssm analyses of rxte data to further constrain the accretion geometry of cyg  x-1 .",
