    "very recently , alexopoulos and leontsinis @xcite observed that in standard databases of distances to 702 galaxies the first digits are a reasonably good fit to benford s law ; see figure [ fig1](a ) .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to show how a benford distribution of galaxy distances follows from hubble s law and certain mathematical properties of benford s law .",
    "the new galaxy - distance law derived here , which is robust with respect to change of scale and base , to additive and multiplicative computational or observational errors , and to small variability of the hubble constant in both time and space , predicts that conformity to benford s law will improve as more data on distances to galaxies becomes available .",
    "conversely , with the logical derivation of the new galaxy - distance law presented here , the recent empirical observations may be viewed as independent evidence of the validity of hubble s law .    ]",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote any distant past base time and the present time , respectively , where time is given in ( earth ) years ( for example , @xmath200:00:00 hours gmt , 1 january 2015 , and @xmath3 ) .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the _ actual distance _ in light years from earth to a generic galaxy at time @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 denote the _ observed distance _ in light years to the galaxy at time @xmath7 . here  distance \" means the standard _",
    "proper distance _",
    "( as opposed to the _ co - moving distance _ ) .",
    "since current measurements are obtained using data from light emitted by the galaxy , the observed distance is the actual distance at the time that light was emitted ; in other words , the observed distance satisfies the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the speed of light ( assumed to be finite and constant ) , and @xmath10 is the time it took for the observed data to arrive .",
    "hubble s law in physical cosmology is the observation that distant galaxies are receding from any observation point , such as earth , at a rate that is proportional to their distance away . in terms of the above notation , the idealized hubble s law ( e.g. , see @xcite )",
    "simply states that @xmath11 assuming @xmath12 is constant ( hubble s constant ) , the solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath13 together , equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) imply @xmath14 looking backward in time , this implies that the actual distance at the base time @xmath0 in terms of the observed distance at the present time @xmath1 satisfies @xmath15",
    "benford s law is the well - known logarithmic statistical distribution of significant ( decimal ) digits , dating back to newcomb @xcite , and popularized by benford @xcite ; the online database @xcite contains over 800 references to this law . to state it formally ,",
    "let @xmath16 denote the decimal _ significand _ ( sometimes called _ coefficient _ in floating - point arithmetic ) of the positive number @xmath17 ; e.g. , @xmath18 .    with this terminology ,",
    "a _ random variable _",
    "@xmath19 _ is benford _ if @xmath20 and _ a sequence _ @xmath21 of real numbers _ is benford _ if @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the decimal logarithm of @xmath7 , and @xmath24 denotes the number of elements in the set a.    the obvious relation between these two concepts that will be used below is this : @xmath25 the most familiar form of benford s law is the special case of first significant digits , namely @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the first significant digit of @xmath17 ; e.g. , @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for example , if a dataset ( random variable or sequence ) is benford , then exactly @xmath31 have first significant digit 1 , and exactly @xmath32 have first significant digit 9 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one of the key properties of benford s law is the fact that it is _ scale - invariant _ , and that it is the only scale - invariant distribution on significant digits ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.8 ) . in terms of random variables , @xmath33 and , in terms of sequences ,",
    "@xmath34 another property of benford sequences that will play an essential role below is related to the well - known fact that if @xmath35 is not a rational power of 10 , then the sequence @xmath36 is benford ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.3 ) ) , which follows easily from the uniform distribution characterization of benford s law and weyl s theorem about irrational rotations on the circle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following generalization of this fact is a crucial part of the argument below ; no explicit reference to it is known to the authors , but it is an easy corollary of ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.3 ) by taking @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 note that the rate of convergence of the sequence in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) to benford depends on both the polynomial @xmath40 and the base @xmath35 .    _",
    "_ none of the familiar classical probability distributions or random variables are benford , including normal , uniform , exponential , beta , binomial , and gamma distributions .",
    "similarly , there is no known `` easy '' explanation of benford s law , and in the context of this note , there is no known easy explanation of why distances to galaxies or stars should be benford . in particular , the all - too - common assumption that `` benford s law applies approximately to any physical quantity that is distributed reasonably smoothly over many orders of magnitude '' is simply wrong .",
    "this can readily be seen by considering a quantity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 has a normal ( gaussian ) distribution with mean 6 and variance 1 .",
    "then @xmath19 is distributed smoothly over many orders of magnitude , but is far from benford , since the first digit of @xmath19 ( which is the same as the first digit of @xmath42 ) is 1 with probability less than @xmath43 . for more details on this large - spread fallacy ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this article is to derive the following law for the distribution of significant digits of distances to galaxies , based on hubble s law and the mathematical properties of benford s law stated above .",
    "when the value of a variable , such as galaxy distance , is not known _ a priori _ , then a neutral assumption the simplest and oldest so - called _ non - informative prior _ in statistics is to consider all values in its range equally likely .    to state a discrete version of the galaxy - distance law concisely ,",
    "say that a _ finite lattice _ is a collection of regularly - spaced real numbers @xmath44 ; for example , the set of numbers @xmath45 @xmath46 is a lattice of 4001 points spaced 0.1 apart starting at 100.0 ( i.e. , here @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . in the framework of this paper , both the starting point @xmath50 and the spacing @xmath51",
    "are completely arbitrary fixed positive numbers , and only the number of points @xmath52 varies .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is now easy to state .    *",
    "galaxy - distance law * : _ if the * observed distance * to a galaxy at any given time is equally likely to be any of the values in a finite lattice , then the * actual distance * at that time approaches a benford distribution as the number of points increases . _    _ moreover , if the distribution of the significant digits of distances is benford at any time in the region where hubble s law holds , then it is benford at all times in that region . _    to derive this law , fix a generic galaxy and assume that @xmath53 , the observed distance to that galaxy at the present time , is equally likely to be any of the values @xmath44 for some @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and integer @xmath56 .",
    "suppose that the observed distance at time @xmath1 is @xmath57 for some @xmath58 ; i.e. , @xmath59 . by equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , it follows that @xmath60 , the actual distance to the galaxy at the base time @xmath0 , satisfies @xmath61 it may be assumed without loss of generality that @xmath35 is not a rational power of 10 .",
    "( this follows since the lebesgue measure of the set of rational powers of 10 is a null set , that is , has probability zero under any absolutely continuous probability distribution .",
    "alternatively , change @xmath51 by an arbitrarily small amount , if necessary , so that @xmath62 is irrational ; since the hubble constant @xmath12 is not known exactly , this is not an issue . )    by claim ( [ eq8 ] ) , with @xmath63 , the sequence @xmath64 is benford , so by the scale - invariance relation for sequences ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath65 is also a benford sequence . by claim ( [ eq6 ] ) and equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , this implies that if @xmath53 is equally likely to be any of the values @xmath66 , then the actual distance @xmath60 at the base time is a benford random variable in the limit as @xmath67 . by equation ( [ eq3 ] ) and the scale - invariance relation for random variables ( [ neweq7 ] )",
    ", this implies that the actual distance @xmath4 is benford at all times @xmath68 , which completes the argument .",
    "thus , the above galaxy - distance law predicts that as more data on distances to galaxies become available , the distribution of the significant digits of that data will become even closer to the benford distribution .    to relate this law to the empirical data on first digits of distances to galaxies described above , it follows from the glivenko - cantelli theorem , the fundamental theorem of statistics , that a large random sample of galaxy distances will have an approximately benford distribution , which is exactly what alexopoulos and leontsinis observed ( @xcite ; see figure [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the fact that this data is a somewhat less - than - stellar fit to the exact logarithmic distribution of benford s law may follow from the relatively small data set ( 702 ) of galaxy distances available , and/or from truncation of a benford sequence whose rate of convergence to benford is unknown ( see the remark following claim ( [ eq8 ] ) ) .    _ note _ : the above model for galaxy distances was predicated on a snapshot of time ( present time ) where the galaxy distance data is available ( to humans ) .",
    "if , instead , galaxy distances are determined at random times over an astronomically large time period ( by definition unavailable to humans ) , it again follows from hubble s law that the resulting galaxy distance data will also approach benford s law , simply because every non - zero exponential function is benford ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.5(iii ) ) .",
    "hubble s law is generally applied only to intergalactic distances , i.e. , distances of the order of magnitude of megaparsecs or gigaparsecs , which are calculated using completely different methods ( such as redshift techniques ) than those methods ( e.g. , parallax ) used to calculate star distances . however",
    ", hubble s law presumably also has a very tiny effect in the much shorter kiloparsec ranges at which star distances are measured , and the above argument applied _ mutatis mutandis _ to the resulting internal expansion of our own galaxy implies that the significant digits of the distances to stars should also approach the benford distribution .",
    "* star - distance law * : _ if the * observed distance * to a star at any given time is equally likely to be any of the values in a finite lattice , then the * actual distance * at that time approaches a benford distribution as the number of points increases .",
    "_    in fact , the distances to stars listed in the 2011 hyg database @xcite is an even better fit to benford s law ( see figure [ fig1](b ) ) than the distances to galaxies , perhaps since the sample size ( 115,256 ) is so much larger .",
    "thus , the empirical evidence that star distances are close to benford s law discovered in @xcite may be viewed as indirect evidence that galaxies are also expanding at a hubble - like exponential rate internally , perhaps with a different constant that reflects the gravitational forces involved .",
    "the benford distribution is remarkably robust , which perhaps helps explain its widespread ubiquity in empirical data ( see @xcite ) . with regard to the galaxy- and star - distance laws above ,",
    "several different aspects of this robustness are relevant .    *",
    "( i ) * since the benford distribution ( on significant digits ) is scale - invariant ( see ( [ neweq7 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) ) , the identical galaxy- and star - distance laws hold regardless of what length units are employed exactly the same logarithmic proportions occur with distances given in inches or furlongs as occur with light years .",
    "similarly , since the benford distribution is the _ unique _ distribution of significant digits that is scale - invariant ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.8 ) , it follows that if there is any universal statistical distribution at all of the significant digits of galaxy distances , by hubble s law it must be benford .    *",
    "( ii ) * since the benford distribution is base - invariant as well ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.5 ) , the analogous galaxy- and star - distance laws also hold with respect to all non - decimal integer bases as well .    *",
    "( iii ) * the hypothesis that the possible observed distances are all equally likely can also be relaxed considerably .",
    "if the likelihoods of observed distances are decreasing with the distance @xmath17 , say proportional to @xmath69 , or are increasing proportional to @xmath70 , then the actual star distances will again be exactly benford .",
    "the likelihood probabilities may even be oscillating , as might be the case when passing through successive clusters of galaxies and intergalactic regions .",
    "for example , if the first thousand distance points in the lattice are equally likely but with low probability , the second thousand are also equally likely but with higher probability , and so on alternating in this fashion , then the distribution of actual galaxy distances will again be exactly benford .",
    "these three assertions all require proof ; the decreasing case is straightforward using ( [ eq8 ] ) since every benford sequence is also `` logarithmic benford '' @xcite , and the increasing and oscillating cases follow by analogous but longer arguments , and are beyond the scope of this article .    *",
    "( iv ) * the same galaxy- and star - distance laws hold if there are limited ( random or deterministic ) additive errors in the calculations , since the resulting sequence with errors is also _ exactly _ benford .",
    "this is clear from the following observation about benford sequences , an immediate corollary of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.7(i ) ) :    * if @xmath71 is benford and @xmath72 , then @xmath73 is benford for all @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is any arbitrary positive number .    * ( v ) * both laws are also unaltered by independent random multiplicative errors , since the benford distribution is an attracting distribution in that if @xmath19 and @xmath42 are independent positive random variables , and either @xmath19 or @xmath42 is benford , then their product @xmath76 is also benford ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 6.3 ) ) .",
    "thus    * if @xmath19 is benford and @xmath77 is any independent error with @xmath78 , then @xmath79 is also benford .    * ( vi ) * a key part of the above argument involved solution of the differential equation ( [ eq2 ] ) under the assumption that hubble s constant @xmath12 is in fact constant .",
    "benford s law , however , is also robust in this respect the solution of every differential equation sufficiently close to equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , e.g. , one where @xmath12 may vary slightly depending on time or space , is also exactly benford ; this can be seen using ( * ? ? ? * thm . 5.3 and cor .",
    "6.5 , respectively ) .",
    "* ( vii ) * the above argument is also robust with respect to the _ magnitudes _ of the speed of light and hubble s constant ; in fact , hubble s constant could even be negative and the universe contracting .",
    "using hubble s law and mathematical properties of benford s law , this article derives a galaxy - distance law which predicts a logarithmic distribution of the significant digits of the distances to galaxies , thereby lending theoretical support to recent empirical findings .",
    "the stated galaxy - distance law is robust with respect to change of scale or base , to possible variability of hubble s constant , and to additive and multiplicative errors in computations .",
    "thus , with the logical derivation of the galaxy - distance law given here , the observations of alexopoulos and leontsinis may be viewed as new independent empirical evidence of the validity of hubble s law .",
    "similarly , with the analogous logical derivation of the above star - distance law , the close fit of star distances to benford s law found in @xcite may be viewed as new empirical evidence that galaxies are also expanding internally at an exponential rate .",
    "we are grateful to erika rogers for bringing the article @xcite to our attention , to theodoros alexopoulos and stefanos leontsinis at cern for providing us with their original data , and to frederic rasio for very helpful comments ."
