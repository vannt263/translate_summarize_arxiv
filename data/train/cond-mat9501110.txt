    "when a thin superconductor is placed in a perpendicular magnetic field there are large demagnetizing fields which produce an enhanced response to the applied field . for instance , the induced magnetic moment in the perpendicular geometry for a sample with thickness @xmath4 and a width @xmath6 is @xmath7 , while in for a longitudinal magnetic field it is only @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these demagnetizing fields are important not only for static properties , but also for dynamic properties , such as the response of the sample to an applied time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "surprisingly , there has been little theoretical work on this subject until recently .",
    "brandt has devised an efficient numerical method for calculating the linear or nonlinear response of superconducting strips @xcite or disks @xcite in time - dependent magnetic fields .",
    "his studies have unveiled a number of interesting properties of the sheet current and magnetic moment in these geometries , including dynamic scaling properties of the current density at the sample edges at high frequencies or short times .",
    "the present paper is an analytic treatment of the linear electrodynamics of thin superconducting strips and disks in perpendicular magnetic fields , and as such is complementary to brandt s numerical work .",
    "many of the features of the linear response which were extracted numerically by brandt emerge naturally from this analysis ; the analytic results obtained here agree quite well with brandt s numerical results .",
    "the calculational technique employed here is the _ method of matched asymptotic expansions _",
    "@xcite , a technique originally devised to treat boundary layer problems in fluid mechanics @xcite , and used recently to study several interesting problems in nonequilibrium and inhomogeneous superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the idea is to split the problem into two pieces ; an `` outer problem '' in the middle of the strip ( which is straightforward to solve ) , and an `` inner problem '' near each of the two edges of the strip ( which requires a bit more ingenuity ) .",
    "the solutions are then matched together , and a `` uniform '' solution , valid across the entire strip , is constructed .",
    "the time dependence of the applied field is treated using laplace transforms , which provides a unified framework for treating the transient response after the applied field is suddenly switched on , as well as the steady - state ac response .",
    "it should be noted that there is an allusion to such a matching procedure for the same problem in a paper by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite ; these authors simply quote a result for the behavior of the current near the edge of a strip in a perpendicular field .",
    "the present work goes well beyond that of larkin and ovchinnikov , by explicitly constructing the inner , outer , and uniform solutions , and using these solutions to study the _",
    "nonequilibrium response_. it also appears that the result quoted by larkin and ovchinnikov is incorrect in detail ( see appendix b ) .",
