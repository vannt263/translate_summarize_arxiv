    "isoscalar monopole excitation in nuclei provides important information on its underlying structure . in the collective liquid drop model ,",

    "the isgmr is observed as a single peak in the @xmath9 inelastic scattering cross sections at small angles , and its excitation energy follows an empirical formula @xmath10  mev , which is directly related to the compressibility of nuclear matter .",

    "it is interesting to study what happens for the isgmr in lighter nuclei .",
    "when the nuclear masses decrease from medium nuclei to light nuclei , the surface - energy correction becomes more important and the excitation energy of isgmr should become lower compared with the empirical formula , indicating a lower nuclear compressibility  @xcite . a lot of theoretical work has been so far devoted to the study of isgmr in light nuclei , for example , within the rpa framework  @xcite and others  @xcite .",

    "it is found that a lot of states in @xmath0o up to @xmath260  mev have a weak coupling structure of @xmath9+@xmath23c , i.e.  loosely bound @xmath9+@xmath23c cluster structure . in particular the @xmath262 [ @xmath263 state",

    "these successes in the @xmath9+@xmath23c ocm mean that  1 )  the weak coupling picture  @xcite is realized in @xmath0o , and the @xmath249 ( @xmath251 ) state of the @xmath243 configuration in shell model picture can be interpreted as the @xmath9 ( @xmath23c ) cluster , and 2 )  the reason why the energy of the @xmath243 configurations is lower that of the @xmath42 one is considered to be the @xmath9-cluster correlation for the @xmath249 state . although the @xmath9-cluster structures for the @xmath43 and @xmath46 states are much different from what brown and green thought  @xcite , one should mention that their conjecture , the energy of the @xmath243 configurations being lower that of the @xmath42 one , is remarkable , because it has played an important role in the progress of our understanding the structure of @xmath0o .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec:4a_ocm ] , the fine structures observed in the experimental monopole strength function in the low energy region up to @xmath2 mev can be rather well reproduced within the @xmath4 ocm framework .",

    "this result means that the @xmath9 clustering degree of freedom is inevitable to reconcile the low - energy behavior of the monopole strength function in @xmath0o with experiment . on the contrary ,",
    "the rpa calculations look likely to reproduce approximately the three bump structures in the experimental monopole strength function in the higher energy region of @xmath5  mev , although some normalization and energy - shifting procedures for the calculated strength function is needed to fit the experimental data ( see sec .",
    "[ introduction ] ) .",
    "here we should remind that the ground state of @xmath0o is described dominantly by a doubly closed shell structure , @xmath137 , in the @xmath4 ocm calculation as well as the rpa , qrpa , and rrpa calculations . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec:4a_ocm ] , the doubly closed shell model wave function is mathematically equivalent to a single @xmath9-cluster wave function .",
    "this result means that the ground - state wave function originally has an @xmath9-clustering degree of freedom together with the single - particle degree of freedom . in other words ,",
    "the ground - state wave function of @xmath0o has a duality of @xmath9-clustering character and mean - field - type character .    from these facts",
    ", one can notice that there exist two types of the isoscalar monopole excitation of @xmath0o , i.e.  the monopole excitations to cluster states are dominant in the lower energy part ( @xmath6 mev ) of the monopole strength function , whereas the monopole excitation of the one - particle one - hole ( @xmath7 ) type contributes to the higher energy region ( @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "this also is in line with the first @xmath39 excited state of the @xmath9-particle which is situated at @xmath265  mev .",
    "thus , one can expect that the reproduction of the experimental isoscalar monopole strength function of @xmath0o in the full energy region up to @xmath266  mev will definitely fail , if one does not take into account simultaneously the @xmath9-cluster - type four - body correlations as well as the @xmath7- and @xmath42-type correlations in the structure study of @xmath0o . in order to tackle the issue ,",
    "a structure calculation is desirable to be performed in which one uses a huge model space covering fully the @xmath9-type correlations together with the @xmath7- and @xmath42-type correlations    we here report on a trial calculation using the @xmath9+@xmath23c cluster basis and collective basis for studying the isoscalar monopole strength of @xmath0o  @xcite . in the latter respect the symplectic group sp(6,@xmath82 )  @xcite as the collective basis was used . since the generators of the sp(6,@xmath82 ) group contain the monopole and quadrupole operators with respect to the nucleon coordinates and conjugate momenta , the group is expected to reproduce the ewsr for the operators .",
    "although there is no effective @xmath19 interactions which is suited for cluster - sp(6,@xmath82 ) mixed basis calculation , they took a phenomenological treatment , since their main purpose was to investigate the effect of the sp(6,@xmath82 ) group to the cluster states  @xcite .",
    "they obtained the following two results :  first comes that the effect of the sp(6,@xmath82 ) basis to the cluster states in the low energy region is not very large .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath43 and @xmath46 states ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) are the cluster states which are reproduced by the @xmath9+@xmath23c model .",
    "the second result is that there are three states in the higher energy region ( @xmath267 mev ) which correspond to the three peaks of the monopole excitation function and share about @xmath165 of the ewsr , although the excitation energies of the three states are higher by about @xmath268 mev .",
    "these results support our finding that the isoscalar monopole excitations in light nuclei , as mentioned above , are dominated by two features :  @xmath9-cluster states at low energies and shell model states at higher energies .",
    "an analysis with a mixed @xmath4 cluster and symplectic group basis may be useful for this study .",
    "we have investigated the monopole strength function in the low energy region up to @xmath2 mev within the framework of @xmath4 ocm , which has succeeded in reproducing all the six @xmath39 states observed up to @xmath2 mev and in giving good agreement with all of the available data such as the decay widths , monopole transition strengths , and r.m.s .",
    "radius of the ground state .",
    "it was found that the fine structures at the low energy region up to @xmath2 mev in the experimental monopole strength function obtained by the @xmath0o@xmath3 experiment is rather satisfactorily reproduced within the @xmath4 ocm framework . on the contrary , mean - field calculations have encountered difficulties to reproduce the fine structures of the monopole strength function at the low energy region as well as the monopole matrix elements for the @xmath262 ( @xmath30  mev ) , @xmath269 ( @xmath207  mev ) , and @xmath270 ( @xmath271  mev ) states obtained in the @xmath0o@xmath45 experiment .",
    "these results mean that the @xmath9 clustering degree of freedom is inevitably necessary to reconcile the monopole strength ( amounting to about @xmath272 of the ewsr ) in the low energy region with experiment . on the other hand , the @xmath4 cluster model has difficulties to reproduce the gross three bump structures of the monopole strength function at the higher energy region of @xmath5  mev .",
    "the gross bump structures look likely to be qualitatively reproduced by the mean - field - theory calculations such as rrpa , rpa , and qrpa , although the energy positions of the three bumps and the absolute values of the strength functions quantitatively deviate from the experimental data . in general",
    "one can expect the interplay between clustering degrees of freedom and mean - field degrees of freedom . since the interplay affects the monopole strength function",
    ", there is a possibility that the isoscalar monopole strength at the higher energy region of @xmath273 , in particular at its lower energy part , contains the influence by clustering degrees of freedom .",
    "the fact that no mean - field - theory calculations have satisfactorily reproduced the isoscalar monopole strength function even at the higher energy region ( @xmath5  mev ) demonstrates the need to investigate the interplay between clustering and mean - field degrees of freedom in the isoscalar monopole strength function .    from the above results ,",
    "one concludes that there exist two features of the isoscalar monopole excitations of @xmath0o , i.e.  the monopole excitation to cluster states dominates the low energy region ( @xmath6  mev ) , sharing about @xmath272 of the ewsr , while that to the @xmath7-type states looks likely to be predominant at the higher energy region .",
    "we indicated that the existence of these two types of the monopole excitations stems from the fact that the ground state of @xmath0o with the dominant doubly closed shell configuration @xmath137 that is the dominant su(3 ) @xmath274 symmetry has in fact a dual feature inasmuch as it can equivalently be described by a cluster wave function of the @xmath9-type as can be shown with the bayman - bohr theorem .",
    "when the monopole operator activates @xmath9-type degrees of freedom in the ground state , @xmath9-cluster states are excited , while in the case of the monopole operator acting on the @xmath7-type degree of freedom in the ground state , collective states of the @xmath7-type are populated .",
    "thus , one will fail to reproduce the experimental isoscalar monopole strength function of @xmath0o up to @xmath275  mev if the @xmath9-cluster - type four - body correlations as well as the @xmath7- and @xmath42-type correlations are not simultaneously taken into account in the structure study of @xmath0o .",
    "the existence of two features of isoscalar monopole excitation which originates from the dual nature of the ground state seems to be general in light nuclei , and the case of @xmath0o discussed in the present paper is typical .",
    "this is due to the nuclear su(3 ) symmetry which is well verified in the ground state of light nuclei .",
    "according to the bayman - bohr theorem , an su(3 ) wave function is mathematically equivalent to a cluster - model wave function .",
    "thus the ground state which has a dominant su(3 ) symmetry is considered to have the dual nature similar to the case of @xmath0o , which generates the two features in the isoscalar monopole excitation .",
    "however , this feature will be vanishing with increasing mass number , and , eventually only the @xmath7-type collective motions are strongly excited , maybe , in the mass region beyond the @xmath276-shell nuclei .",
    "the reason for this is that the quality of the nuclear su(3 ) symmetry in the ground state of light nuclei is gradually disappearing because of the stronger effect from the spin - orbit forces in heavier nuclei .",
    "this means that the dual nature of the ground state is also corroding with increasing mass number .",
    "it is an intriguing subject to study theoretically and experimentally how these two features are changing with the mass number .",
    "thus , it is strongly hoped that systematic experiments of analyzing the existence of these two features of monopole excitations will be performed in near future .",

    "<S> isoscalar monopole strength function in @xmath0o up to @xmath1 mev is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the fine structures at the low energy region up to @xmath2 mev in the experimental monopole strength function obtained by the @xmath0o@xmath3 reaction can be rather satisfactorily reproduced within the framework of the @xmath4 cluster model , while the gross three bump structures observed at the higher energy region ( @xmath5 mev ) look likely to be approximately reconciled by the mean - field calculations such as rpa and qrpa . in this paper , it is emphasized that two different types of monopole excitations exist in @xmath0o ;  one is the monopole excitation to cluster states which is dominant in the lower energy part ( @xmath6 mev ) , and the other is the monopole excitation of the mean - field type such as one - particle one - hole ( @xmath7 ) which is attributed mainly to the higher energy part ( @xmath8 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that this character of the monopole excitations originates from the fact that the ground state of @xmath0o with the dominant doubly closed shell structure has a duality of the mean - field - type as well as @xmath9-clustering character . </S>",
    "<S> this dual nature of the ground state seems to be a common feature in light nuclei . </S>",
