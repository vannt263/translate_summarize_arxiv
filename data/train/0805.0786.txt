    "the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , by which particles are created and annihilated due to accelerating boundaries that disturb the quantum vacuum , has been extensively studied since the quantization by moore @xcite , in the early 1970s , of the radiation field in a cavity with moving , perfectly reflecting boundaries . * *  * * the problem of the electromagnetic field quantization in a time - dependent dielectric medium inside the cavity was solved two decades later by dodonov and co - workers @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , both the nonuniform motion of the boundaries @xcite and the sudden change of the refractive index of the dielectric @xcite produce similar effects , resulting in particle creation from the quantum vacuum .",
    "the quantum statistical properties of the created photon , expected to exhibit nonclassical features , has also been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a nonthermal distribution and squeezing were predicted .",
    "a decade ago , eberlein @xcite , following the reasoning by schwinger @xcite , conjectured , that the sonoluminescence phenomenon results from particle creation due to moving boundaries between media of different polarizability , attracting even more attention to the dce .",
    "as pointed out by p. knight @xcite , the proof of eberlein s conjecture would require a demonstration that the created photon pairs emerging from the  dce have the nonclassical statistics expected from a purely quantum effect .",
    "this observation points up the importance of the quantum optical view of the dce , especially regarding the computation of the quantum statistical properties of the created photons .",
    "the thermal effects on the creation of particles under the influence of time - dependent boundaries has also been investigated , either by taking into account a formal model for the reservoir @xcite or simply by assuming a closed system to be initially at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "regarding the relevance of thermal effects for the experimental verification of the dce , it is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that finite temperatures can enhance the number of particle creation  by several orders of magnitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the formal reservoir is modeled by assuming that one of the cavity boundaries is a fixed leaky mirror while the other boundary moves , as sketched in fig .",
    "the reservoir thus comprehends a discrete space of eigenfrequencies generated by an additional boundary fixed far away from the leaky mirror . such a model for a lossy cavity",
    "was first adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , envisaging , however , a static dissipative cavity .",
    "it is worth noting that l. parker @xcite , addressing the problem of particle creation in expanding universes in the late 1960s , observed that the initial presence of bosons tends to increase the number of bosons created by the expansion mechanism  similarly to the result reported in ref .",
    "@xcite  while the situation is reversed for fermions .",
    "the problem of the expanding universe bears great similarity to the dce and considerable efforts have been devoted to this subject @xcite .",
    "the formulation , by law @xcite , of an effective hamiltonian for the dce , enabling the dynamical description of the cavity field in the schrdinger picture , also represents a significant contribution . through this hamiltonian , which exhibits the essential features of the physical process",
    ", it becomes possible to know the explicit form of the field state and to describe , in a simplified form , the characteristic resonances which are also relevant to the experimental verification of the dce .",
    "regarding a cavity with moving boundaries , the quadratic structure of the effective hamiltonian incorporates the instantaneous modes of the cavity , parametrically amplified and coupled to each other due to the moving boundaries . generalizing law@xmath0s procedure , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors derive an effective hamiltonian for the dce in a more realistic leaky ( 3 + 1)-dimensional cavity , the reservoir being modeled as mentioned above .    in the present manuscript , reasoning by analogy with the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain a dissipative counterpart of the effective hamiltonian * *  * * introduced in ref . @xcite . from this hamiltonian ,",
    "we compute a general expression for the average number of created particles which  differently from the expression derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , holding only for the parametric resonance condition  applies to any the law of motion for the boundary .",
    "together with the effective hamiltonian , our expression for the number of photon creation enables us to draw the whole scenario of the emerging resonances .",
    "moreover , we provide a comprehensive analysis of the decoherence mechanisms within the nonideal dce , along the lines discussed below .",
    "more recently , the study of decoherence within the dce has produced some interesting results @xcite , linking two topics that attract much attention nowadays from theoretical @xcite and experimental physics @xcite .",
    "as far as decoherence is concerned , it is well established that any process inducing quantum fluctuations in the evolution of a quantum system leads to the decoherence of its superposition states @xcite . as a typical case ,",
    "the inevitable dissipative mechanisms accompanying the injection  of noise from the reservoir into the system drags its pure state into a statistical mixture . in this particular situation ,",
    "such noise injection comes entirely from the large number of degrees of freedom modeling a multimode reservoir .",
    "when a few degrees of freedom are coupled to the system of interest , poincar recurrence takes place instead of the decoherence process @xcite .    focusing on a radiation mode inside a nonideal cavity with stationary mirrors",
    ", it is the photon absorption by the mirrors ( or the photon leakage in an open cavity ) that triggers the decoherence dynamics @xcite .",
    "the technological search for higher - quality cavities is of no less interest than the theoretical efforts to provide mechanisms to bypass decoherence in a quantum information processor @xcite .",
    "although the protocols proposed to control or circumvent decoherence go far beyond the requirements for conditions that weaken the system - reservoir coupling @xcite , again , the practical efforts aimed at achieving quantum information processing  such as the miniaturization of physical ingredients like laser beams and microcavities  are no less challenging .",
    "similarly to photon absorption in a nonideal cavity , photon creation and scattering at moving cavity boundaries is also a source of fluctuation injection into the mode of interest .",
    "in fact , as mentioned above , all the cavity modes are coupled together due to the moving boundaries @xcite by processes leading to photon creation and scattering .",
    "consequently , all the instantaneous cavity modes are subjected to injection of noise from the remaining instantaneous modes acting as a reservoir .",
    "therefore , in a situation where a superposition state is prepared in a particular mode of a nonideal cavity with moving boundaries , two distinct sources of decoherence take place : the reservoir itself and the mechanism of amplification and multimode coupling induced by the moving boundary .",
    "a detailed analysis of the decoherence process under both sources of noise injection can reveal interesting features of both the dce and decoherence .",
    "a particular case of decoherence of a superposition state prepared in a selected mode of an ideal cavity with oscillating boundaries has already been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors focus on the resonance condition , where the oscillatory frequency of the boundaries is an integer multiple of the fundamental mode eigenfrequency . under this condition",
    " which maximizes the photon creation number @xcite  and in the absence of a reservoir , the decoherence time of a superposition of coherent states prepared in the fundamental mode is estimated by considering the coupling of this mode only with its first - excited neighbor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is demonstrated that the dce induces the decoherence of a superposition state of a massive mirror in a harmonic potential , within a time scale which depends on the energy of the state components , thus obeying the correspondence principle .    in the present study , similarly to our analysis of the average particle creation number",
    ", we also approach the problem of decoherence from a general scenario where a superposition state is prepared in a selected mode of a nonideal cavity with a mirror undergoing an arbitrary motion .",
    "we take into account the coupling of the selected instantaneous mode with all the remaining cavity modes and not only with its nearest neighbors , even under the resonance condition .",
    "as depicted below , our analysis is again based on the effective dissipative hamiltonian derived by analogy with the approaches in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observe that the linear entropy associated with a superposition state prepared in a selected mode exhibits resonances similar to those which take place in the average number of particle creation .",
    "such resonances of the linear entropy reveal that the purity loss of the prepared superposition occurs in appreciable rates only for specific values of the detuning between the oscillatory frequency of the boundary and the fundamental mode of the static cavity .",
    "the decoherence time of the prepared state associated with these resonances is computed analytically .",
    "interestingly , out of the resonances , the purity loss or the decoherence process can be disregarded within the nonideal dce .",
    "as discussed above , an effective hamiltonian for the quantized field in a cavity with a moving boundary was presented by law @xcite .",
    "this exhibits the essential features of the dce and enables the dynamic description of the field modes in the schrdinger picture .",
    "law assumed a dielectric medium in the cavity , with a permittivity that varied in time and space , which we shall disregard**. * * however , following the reasoning in @xcite , we also consider a dissipative potential @xmath1 to model a dispersive mirror of the cavity @xcite .",
    "thus , our starting lagrangian density for a massless and neutral scalar radiation field @xmath2 acted upon by a dissipative force , is given by ( @xmath3)@xmath4 ^{2}-\\left [   \\partial_{x}\\phi(x , t)\\right ]   ^{2}-\\gamma\\delta(x)\\phi ^{2}(x , t)\\right\\ }   \\text { , } \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the boundary conditions @xmath5   = 0 $ ] , with @xmath6 representing an arbitrary law of motion of the mirror , must be satisfied . expanding the whole radiation field @xmath2",
