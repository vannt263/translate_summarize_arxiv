    "another source of systematic uncertainty is in the factor @xmath80 .",
    "we compared three methods of determining this factor : a study of inclusive electron scattering rates ; fits to the low electron - pion missing mass spectra ; and the value that gives the best agreement for @xmath19 between the fully exclusive topology and the topology where the recoil nucleon is not detected .",
    "this last technique relies on the fact that the fully exclusive topology has much less nuclear background . from these comparisons ,",

    "it is also possible for assumptions made in the dilution factor fitting , such as the lack of @xmath7 dependence , to result in point - to - point systematic uncertainties .",

    "[ fig : www5 ] that the cut on electron - pion missing mass is not 100% effective at removing multi - pion production , for the topology with one missing nucleon . since the contamination is larger for @xmath96 than for @xmath97 , we divided the data into two distinct sets , based on the above criteria , and compared both @xmath19 and @xmath18 asymmetries .",
    "we obtained @xmath94/d.f.=0.98 ( @xmath94/d.f.=1.02 ) for agreement of the two @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) data sets , indicating that the admixture of some multi - pion events into the single pion samples does not affect the final asymmetry results significantly .    adding the above sources of uncertainty in quadrature , we obtain overall normalization uncertainty of 3% for @xmath19 and 5% for @xmath18 .",
