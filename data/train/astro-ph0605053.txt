    "ultraviolet ( uv ) transitions of metallic ions , particularly those involving the ground or low - lying states , are important probes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , providing direct information about the abundances and kinematics of gas clouds along the lines - of - sight toward bright stars .",
    "the advent of space - borne telescopes equipped with high - resolution uv spectrographs , such as the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) , focused attention on the ( im)precision of most uv resonance laboratory wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "typical laboratory wavelength uncertainties were @xmath62m  @xcite while the resolving powers of the astronomical spectrographs were as high as @xmath7 ( 25m  at 1250 ) .",
    "thus , the analysis technique and physical information recoverable from the astronomical spectra were often compromised ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the same uv transitions are observed in the optical region in the study of highly redshifted absorption - lines arising in galaxies and the intergalactic medium along the sight - lines to distant quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "the era of 810-m class ground - based telescopes with stable high - resolution spectrographs ( e.g.  keck / hires , vlt / uves , subaru / hds ) has seen a dramatic improvement in the quality and quantity of spectra covering a multitude of metal - line transitions , particularly in studies of damped lyman-@xmath8 systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while it is clearly important for these general galactic and extragalactic applications to have accurate and precise laboratory wavelengths , recent developments in the study of cosmological variations in the fundamental constants has demanded an order of magnitude improvement in the laboratory wavelengths of several ionized metallic transitions .",
    "the universality and constancy of the laws of nature rely on the space - time invariance of fundamental constants , such as the fine - structure constant , @xmath0 .",
    "tests of the constancy of @xmath8 therefore probe deviations from the standard model of particle physics .",
    "qso absorption lines are a particularly attractive probe , constraining @xmath8-variation over large spatial and temporal scales .",
    "initial studies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) focused on comparison of the fine - structure splitting in alkali - doublets ( ads ) of , for example , siiv , in qso and laboratory spectra but , as demonstrated by @xcite , the dominant error in these studies arose from laboratory wavelength uncertainties .    considerable recent interest has focused on the many - multiplet ( mm ) method introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mm method is a generalisation of the ad method , constraining changes in @xmath8 by utilising many observed transitions from different multiplets and different ions associated with each qso absorption system .",
    "it holds many important advantages over the ad method , including an effective order - of - magnitude precision gain stemming from the large differences in the sensitivity of light ( e.g.  mg , si , al ) and heavy ( e.g.  fe , zn , cr ) ions to varying @xmath8 . the mm method , applied to keck / hires qso absorption spectra , has yielded very surprising results , with the first tentative evidence for a varying @xmath8 by @xcite becoming stronger with successively larger samples ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these results have proven robust to many astrophysical and instrumental systematic errors @xcite , more recent studies of much smaller samples of vlt / uves spectra suggest null results @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the keck / hires and vlt / uves results is yet to be resolved .",
    "the precision in the relative change in @xmath8 achieved by the above mm analyses is @xmath9 which corresponds to a velocity precision of @xmath10 , or @xmath11  at 2500   a typical rest - frame wavelength for the transitions used in mm analyses .",
    "this is an order of magnitude more precise than most lines in @xcite .",
    "significant recent effort has therefore been invested into improving the laboratory wavelengths of transitions which can be used in mm analyses .",
    "high precision laboratory measurements of uv lines from mgi , mgii , crii , znii and niii have previously been reported by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have remeasured these lines ( except the niii lines , which are beyond the range of the lund fourier transform spectrometer ) for confirmation .",
    "we have also included another set of lines from mgi , tiii , mnii and feii , which are all visible in qso absorption spectra . in total",
    "we present high precision laboratory wavelength measurements of 23 uv lines from seven ionic species .",
    "the uncertainty in the laboratory wavelengths depends both on the measurement precision and the wavenumber calibration . to reduce the uncertainty in relative wavelengths , the spectra of all ionic species were produced in the same hollow cathode light source , using a composite cathode",
    "this made it possible for the different spectra to be recorded simultaneously and the relative wavelengths are thus less dependent on the calibration uncertainty .",
    "due to a combination of range in relative line intensities , a line blend , and detector and instrument response at different wavelengths , it was necessary to acquire three different spectra for this analysis .",
    "the wavelengths for all lines , apart from one weak feii line , are determined with the required uncertainty of @xmath12  or better . for strong symmetric lines measured in the same recording the relative uncertainties",
    "are estimated to be @xmath13  or better .",
    "confidence in this level of uncertainty was ensured by investigations of calibration effects as well as isotope structure and hyperfine structure of the lines .",
    "spectra of mgi , mgii , tiii , crii , mnii , feii and znii were produced in a water cooled hollow cathode discharge lamp ( hcl ) .",
    "the composite cathode used was made of pure fe with small pieces of mg , ti , cr , mn and zn placed in it .",
    "the cathode had an inner diameter of 7.0 mm and a length of 50 mm .",
    "a mixture of ne and ar was used as carrier gas .",
    "ne generally produces higher signal - to - noise ratios while ar is used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the mixture of about 1/3ne and 2/3ar gave a stable light source with good signal - to - noise ratios ( snr@xmath14100 ) for most lines used in this study .",
    "the light source was run with a current between 0.6 and 0.7a and a pressure between 0.9 and 1.0torr .",
    "the main excitation mechanism in the hollow cathode is electron collisions , but charge transfer with the carrier gas ions may in certain cases contribute to the production and excitation of singly ionized atoms @xcite .",
    "spectra were also recorded with a pure fe cathode since the feii @xmath152586  line was blended with a mnii line in the spectrum from the composite cathode . the mnii transition in question is not one of interest in qso absorption - line work ",
    "it is between two excited states rather than between the ground ( or very low - lying ) state and an excited state .",
    "the wavenumbers were measured with the lund ft500 uv fourier transform ( ft ) spectrometer , which is optimized in the wavelength range of 20007000 .",
    "spectra of two overlapping wavenumber regions were acquired with different photomultiplier detectors , one between 20000 and 40000@xmath3 and another between 25000 and 50000@xmath3 .",
    "it was not possible to include all lines of interest in one recording because of the limitations in wavenumber range for the photomultipliers and the ft spectrometer .",
    "the tiii lines are lower in wavenumber than the rest of the lines and were therefore measured in a separate spectral acquisition .",
    "this recording also included the arii calibration lines .",
    "the resolution of the measurements was 0.06@xmath3 for the measured spectrum between 25000 and 50000@xmath3 and 0.05@xmath3 between 20000 and 40000@xmath3 .",
    "this was sufficient to completely resolve the single lines .",
    "twenty scans were co - added to achieve good signal - to - noise ratios ( snr@xmath16 ) for most of the lines in this study .",
    "the noise in spectra observed with ft spectrometry , using the type of light source and detectors stated above , is predominantly photon noise .",
    "white noise in the interferogram is transformed into the spectral region as white noise , with a constant level throughout the spectrum .",
    "all spectral lines seen by the detector contribute to this noise level .",
    "it is therefore a disadvantage to record lines outside the region of interest . in order to band limit the spectra , reducing the noise , solar - blind photomultipliers ( hamamatsu r166 )",
    "were used for the uv region .",
    "these have a long - wavelength cut - off at about 3000 . for the lower wavenumber region , uv to visible , a wider range photomultiplier ( 1p28 )",
    "the two types of photomultipliers overlap in wavenumber regions , giving a small region for transfer of calibration between them ( see section  [ calibration ] ) .",
    "the light source was placed close to the aperture of the spectrometer and focused with a lens .",
    "this was to increase the signal - to - noise ratio for lines close to 2000 , where air absorbs most light . to minimize turbulence and to further reduce the absorption from air the spectrometer was evacuated to a pressure of about 0.015 torr .    to ensure",
    "the lines are unaffected by self - absorption the quantity of each metal inserted in the cathode had to be varied and tested through a large number of recorded spectra .",
    "this was especially the case for the znii doublet . with just a trace of zn",
    "the lines were strong but unaffected by self - absorption .",
    "for the mgi lines the procedure was similar , but the strong @xmath152852  line and the much weaker @xmath152026  line had to be measured in different recordings .",
    "the weak @xmath152026  line had to be measured with more mg in the cathode , which gave a clearly self - reversed profile for the strong @xmath152852  line .",
    "the @xmath152852  line was therefore measured in the same recording as the tiii lines .",
    "the lamp conditions and spectrometer resolution for the three recordings are listed in table  [ exptable ] .",
    "to further investigate the effects of possible self - absorption and pressure shifts of the lines , recordings were also made with different currents and pressures in the light source .",
    "the effects were considered negligible and are discussed in sections  [ calibration ] ,  [ mnhyperfine ] and  [ isotope ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath17zapadlik , i. , johansson , s. and litzn , u. , private communication 2006 . published in the compilation by @xcite [ resultstable ]    for the many - multiplet method it is the relative shifts of the lines that is most important .",
    "the present investigation therefore includes lines from different species measured in the same recordings , which reduces the uncertainties of the relative wavenumbers .",
    "previous ft spectrometry measurements of the crii , znii @xcite , mgii lines and the mgi @xmath152852  line @xcite have been made for the same reason as this investigation ( these are included in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite measured the lines at two different laboratories ( imperial college , london , and lund ) to ensure a minimization of systematic errors . at lund",
    "a composite cathode was used , similar to the present investigation , to reduce the relative uncertainties .",
    "the published values for cr and zn were , however , weighted means of the icl and lu results .",
    "one significant difference between the previous lund - icl and the present investigations is the calibration .",
    "the previous wavenumbers have been calibrated directly or indirectly with arii lines from @xcite .",
    "there is a systematic difference between these wavenumbers compared to the @xcite wavenumbers used for calibration in this work , see section  [ calibration ] . in fig .",
    "[ comparisonfig ] the difference between the wavenumbers from this work and the previous published wavenumbers are plotted showing an offset of about 0.003@xmath3 stemming from the difference in the calibration lines used .",
    "included in the plot are wavenumbers of mgi , mgii , crii , znii @xcite and feii @xcite lines , which all are measured using fourier transform spectrometers .",
    "the difference between the whaling and norln arii calibration lines have been discussed by @xcite , where a correction is recommended for the previously published feii lines in @xcite .",
    "the previous wavenumbers are recommended to be increased by @xmath18 parts in @xmath19 .",
    "for the 5 feii lines studied in this investigation the correction would imply that the wavenumbers from @xcite should be increased with about @xmath20 @xmath3 .",
    "this confirms that the offset in fig .",
    "[ comparisonfig ] is mainly stemming from the difference in the sets of calibration lines .",
    "recently also ft spectrometry measurements of the wavelengths for the mnii lines have been published , together with hyperfine constants for the levels included , by @xcite .",
    "also these wavenumbers were calibrated with arii lines from @xcite and should therefore be lower , by 0.003 @xmath3 , than the wavenumbers measured in this investigation .",
    "the estimated uncertainties are however larger than for symmetric lines , both for our measurements and for those of blackwell - whitehead , due to the hyperfine structure .",
    "the measurements agree , within the uncertainties , when the calibration difference is taken into account .",
    "the previous values for tiii are unpublished ft spectrometry measurements by zapadlik et al .",

    "the error bars represent the stated uncertainties of the previous values.,width=317 ]      the absolute wavenumber uncertainty contains two main factors : the uncertainty of the calibration and the uncertainty of the determination of the line position .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath21 of the line position @xmath22 of a fitted line profile can be written as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the signal - to - noise ratio for the line , @xmath25 is the resolution interval and @xmath26 is the fwhm of the line .",
    "the number of points across the width of the line is given by @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is a numerical constant depending on the shape of the line . for a pure gaussian profile",
    "the value is @xmath29 and for a pure lorentzian profile the value is @xmath30 @xcite .    the uncertainty from the calibration is derived from the uncertainties stated by @xcite , from the uncertainties of the line positions of the calibration lines and from the standard deviation of the calibration factors .    for the mnii lines",
    "the cog is given and the uncertainty is estimated by calculating the standard deviation of 20 different measurements of the cog ( in one recording ) of each line , adding the standard deviation given by making the same measurements in different recordings ( with different lamp conditions ) and finally including the uncertainty of the calibration .",
    "this resulted in a total uncertainty of @xmath31@xmath3 for the three mnii lines .",
    "the difference in wavenumbers between two lines measured in the same recording follows from eq .",
    "[ correq ] and can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the calibration factor for the recorded spectrum . by applying the law of propagation of uncertainty ,",

    "[ unceq ] , and @xmath37 is the uncertainty of the calibration factor for the observed spectrum , see table  [ exptable ] .",
    "this means that for symmetric lines with high signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath14250 ) the relative wavenumbers ( for lines within the same spectral recording ) are determined with an uncertainty of @xmath5@xmath3 , or better .",
    "the uncertainty is smallest for lines which are close in wavenumber , due to the linear correction , and then depends mostly on the line fitting .",
    "constraints on possible cosmological variations in the fine - structure constant rely crucially on comparison with accurate laboratory standards . here",
    "we have measured 23 transitions , with particular emphasis on _ relative _ wavelength precision , which are central to many - multiplet ( mm ) analyses of qso absorption spectra .",
    "the precision is improved by measuring the lines simultaneously from a composite light source .",
    "the lines are calibrated against new secondary standard lines of arii , produced in the same light source .",
    "the estimated absolute uncertainty is 0.1m  for 15 lines , 0.2m  for 7 lines and 0.3m  for one line .",
    "it should be pointed out that the mnii lines are severely broadened due to unresolved hyperfine structure , and that their wavelengths represent centre - of - gravity values .",
    "the relative wavenumbers for strong , symmetric lines in the same spectral recording are determined with an uncertainty of 0.03m  at 2500 .",
    "this is the first time the 5 transitions of tiii and the mgi @xmath152026 and feii @xmath152260 transitions have been measured with sufficient precision for use in the mm method .",
    "the remaining 16 transitions of mgi , mgii , crii , mnii , feii and znii have been measured to as high precision before using a different set of calibration lines . _",
    "the importance of repeated laboratory measurements can not be emphasised enough given the role they play in fundamental physics experiments at cosmological distances and look - back times_.    due to the newly adopted wavenumbers for a set of ar ii calibration lines the absolute wavenumbers of the majority of the lines have been shifted by about 0.003@xmath3 ( about 0.1 - 0.2m ) compared to previous values ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the wavelengths which have been measured to as high a precision before agree with the present wavelengths to within the uncertainties , when this calibration difference is taken into account .",
    "this leads to a greater confidence in these wavelengths , while the high relative precision in this work reduces the potential for systematic effects in the mm method .",
