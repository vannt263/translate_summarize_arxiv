    "consider a sample of independent copies @xmath2 of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a real - valued random variable and @xmath1 is a square - integrable random function defined on the unit interval .",

    "we consider two cases : ( a ) @xmath4 is directly observed ; and ( b ) @xmath4 is not observed and is estimated as a residual of a parametric model for functional covariates and scalar responses .",
    "there has been substantial recent work on the theoretical study of the functional data analysis .",
    "the monographs of ramsay and silverman ( 2002 , 2005 ) and ferraty ( 2011 ) provide a comprehensive landscape of the importance of the statistical methods for functional data .",
    "estimation and prediction with functional covariates received substantial attention in the literature : for example by ferraty and vieu ( 2006 ) , cai and hall ( 2006 ) , hall and horowitz ( 2007 ) , crambes , kneip and sarda ( 2008 ) , yao and mller ( 2010 ) and the references therein .",
    "the goodness - of - fit problem we address seems to be much less explored .",
    "there is a large literature on model checks like ( [ hh0 ] ) against nonparametric alternatives when @xmath1 takes values in a finite - dimension space , see for instance hrdle and mammen ( 1993 ) , stute ( 1997 ) , horowitz and spokoiny ( 2001 ) , guerre and lavergne ( 2005 ) . in the case of functional covariate @xmath1 ,",
    "much little work was accomplished for testing against general types of alternatives . to our best knowledge , the only contribution considering the problem of testing @xmath7 against nonparametric alternatives in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) is the recent paper of delsol , ferraty and vieu ( 2011 ) who extend the idea of hrdle and mammen ( 1993 ) to the functional covariate case .",
    "however , their results are derived under some strong assumptions , like for instance the assumptions on the rates of convergence of the so - called small ball probabilities and the law of the covariate @xmath1 that are supposed to be known .",
    "it is not clear how the test of delsol , ferraty and vieu ( 2011 ) could be easily applied in practice , for instance for testing the goodness - of - fit of the functional linear model .",
    "some more substantial work was done for testing for no effect in a functional linear model , see cardot , ferraty , mas and sarda ( 2003 ) , cardot , goia and sarda ( 2007 ) , or for testing the functional linear model against quadratic alternatives , see horvth and reeder ( 2011 ) . by construction ,",
    "such procedures are not able to detect general departures from the null hypothesis .",
    "the test we introduce herein is based on a dimension reduction idea used by lavergne and patilea ( 2008 ) in a finite dimension setup .",
    "our test is able to detect _ nonparametric _ alternatives , including the polynomial ones .",
    "the variable @xmath4 could be heteroscedastic and we do not require the conditional variance of @xmath4 given @xmath1 to be known .",
    "we do no require the law of the covariate @xmath1 to be given or to be of a certain type , like for instance gaussian .",
    "the test could be implemented quite easily and performs well in simulations and real data applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section1 ]",
    "we introduce the main notation and we derive a fundamental lemma for our approach .",
    "this lemma shows that checking condition ( [ hh0 ] ) is equivalent to checking the nullity of the conditional expectation of @xmath4 given a sufficiently rich set of projections of @xmath1 on elements of norm 1 from finite - dimension subspaces of @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "next , the idea is to search in finite - dimension subspaces of @xmath0 $ ] a least favorable element of norm 1 and to check the nullity of the conditional expectation of @xmath4 given the scalar product between @xmath1 and the selected least favorable direction . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the test statistic for testing of no - effect of @xmath1 on @xmath4 when @xmath4 is observed .",
    "our statistic is a quadratic form , based on _ univariate _ kernel smoothing , that behaves like a standard normal random variable under @xmath7 .",
    "we prove that , under mild integrability or boundedness assumptions , the induced test is consistent against _ any _ type of fixed alternatives and against sequences of directional alternatives approaching the null hypothesis at a suitable rate .",
    "the allowed rates are almost the same as those obtained in parametric model checks based on kernel smoothing with _ univariate _ covariate , see for instance guerre and lavergne ( 2005 ) or lavergne and patilea ( 2008 ) . in section [ sec44 ]",
    "we apply our projection - based approach for nonparametric checks of the functional regression models .",
    "we will focus on the linear functional model , although , at the expense of longer arguments , the methodology we propose also adapts to other models , like for instance the generalized functional linear models introduced by mller and stadtmller ( 2005 ) . in the functional regression case the variable @xmath4 is the unobserved error term of the regression model and hence the test statistic is based on the estimated residuals .",
    "we still obtain standard normal critical values and consistency against nonparametric alternatives , fixed or approaching the null hypothesis . however , more restrictive conditions on the bandwidths are required due to the estimation of the slope of the functional linear model .",
    "this induces restrictions on the rate the directional alternatives may approach the null hypothesis .",
    "more difficult the estimation of the slope parameter is , slower the rate the directional alternative approach the null hypothesis should be . for estimating the slope parameter in the functional linear regression model we will focus on the standard approach based on functional principal component analysis . in section [ cesar_is_the_best ]",
    "an empirical study is reported .",
    "first , a wild bootstrap procedure is proposed as a means to approximate the critical values of the test statistic .",
    "then , the results of a simulation study are briefly explained .",
    "the conclusion is that the test works well in practice . under the null ,",
    "the level is quite well respected and the power is more than acceptable even in the comparison with parametric tests .",
    "the proposed test is consistent under general alternatives .",
    "some advices and comments are provided about the choice of the parameters involved in the new test .",
    "the test is applied to test the goodness - of - fit of the functional linear model and the functional quadratic model for the tecator data set .",

    "<S> this paper studies the problem of nonparametric testing for the effect of a random functional covariate on a real - valued error term . </S>",

    "<S> the error term could be directly observed as a response or _ estimated _ from a functional parametric model , like for instance the functional linear regression . </S>",
    "<S> our test is based on the remark that checking the no - effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking the nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a sufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate . </S>",
    "<S> such projections could be on elements of norm 1 from finite - dimension subspaces of @xmath0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> next , the idea is to search a finite - dimension element of norm 1 that is , in some sense , the least favorable for the null hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it remains to perform a nonparametric check of the nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given the scalar product between the covariate and the selected least favorable direction . </S>",
    "<S> for such finite - dimension search and nonparametric check we use a kernel - based approach . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> our test statistic is a quadratic form based on univariate kernel smoothing and the asymptotic critical values are given by the standard normal law . </S>",
    "<S> the test is able to detect nonparametric alternatives , including the polynomial ones . </S>",
    "<S> the error term could present heteroscedasticity of unknown form . </S>",
    "<S> we do no require the law of the covariate @xmath1 to be known . </S>",
    "<S> the test could be implemented quite easily and performs well in simulations and real data applications . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the performance of our test for checking the functional linear regression model .    </S>",
