    "* three phenomenological parameters * were used @xcite to calculate the additional energy of cnc formation , as compared with the known specific energy of an infinite graphite sheet ( graphene ) .",
    "the energy of any carbon cluster with a curved surface is decomposed into additive terms .",
    "each term is given by some characteristic energy ( the model parameter ) multiplied by a number depending solely on the cluster geometry .",
    "this essential simplification of the calculation is based on natural reasoning .",
    "there are 3 sources bringing at least 3 parameters into the energy ( excepting the `` zero energy '' of an atom belonging to an infinite graphite sheet ; this term is excluded from further expessions ) .",
    "the first additional term comes from dangling bonds .",
    "the corresponding energy parameter , @xmath2 , is the dangling bond energy .",
    "an extra energy due to a change of the degree of a hybridisation of an electron orbit on the curved surface is described using the second parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the last parameter , @xmath4 , is the total energy of twelve pentagonal rings .",
    "this parameter reflects that an electron belonging to the pentagon must have energy different from that in a graphite - like hexagon .",
    "hence , it partly takes into account non - equivalent bonds . note",
    "that this is a topologically determined donation to the total energy of any closed cluster @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the curvature of a surface is a function of a point .",
    "the curvature is constant and equal to @xmath5 for a sphere of radius @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for a tube of the same radius . for the sake of clarity , we consider here only the surface with constant curvature .",
    "one easily obtains the formation energy of an infinite carbon tube .",
    "the specific energy of dangling bonds is negligible since it goes to zero with the tube size going to infinity .",
    "a tube has no pentagon , because a cylinder is topologically equivalent to a plane .",
    "hence , the energy has only one term , the `` curvature energy '' @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the number of atoms and @xmath6 is the dimensionless tube radius .",
    "henceforth , all lengths will be measured in bond lengths ( @xmath9   not supposed to vary according to the model ) .",
    "we compared the tube energy with the relevant results of other computations @xcite .",
    "this gave the first parameter of the model : @xmath10  ev  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "most likely , the energy of a dangling bond in cnc does not differ too much from the value for graphite , and therefore , we took @xmath11  ev .",
    "the total energy associated with the dangling bonds is proportional to the cluster perimeter length ( length of the open boundary of the cnc lattice ) multiplied by the density of dangling bonds along the perimeter , which in turn depends on the local geometry .",
    "one can imagine , for example , a finite tube as a parallelogram , carved from hexagonal graphene , which has its opposite sides glued @xcite .",
    "this parallelogram has a variable number of sites on the open perimeter @xmath12 ( dangling bond density ) , depending on its orientation relative to the lattice vector .",
    "none the less the density varies in a narrow region .",
    "if we take the geometrical factor in @xmath12 to be unity for the `` zigzag '' tube , then it becomes @xmath13 for the `` armchair '' tube ; one can easily calculate @xmath12 for the bond density of a specific tube lying between these extreme examples .",
    "it was shown in our previous papers @xcite , that there occurs * competition * in the formation energy of a finite tube between two terms with @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( the energy associated with dangling bonds can not be neglected for a tube of finite length ) .",
    "the tube energy reads as : @xmath14 .",
    "it is advisable to make the total perimeter @xmath15 shorter in order to diminish the number of dangling bonds .",
    "the radius decrease costs an extra total energy owing to stronger curvature .",
    "we called the cluster having the minimal energy at a certain number of atoms `` an optimal cluster '' .",
    "the optimal cluster is the configuration governed by energy consideration at any fixed @xmath1 .",
    "( the nanotube energetics and the tube formation road from a flat graphene were discussed in details in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , we constructed a phenomenological approach and predicted the optimal cluster shape , based on the energetics of any nanotube without performing a quantum - chemical calculation each time .",
    "the third parameter of the model was determined by fitting the formation energy of a spherical cluster to the experimental value for @xmath16 .",
    "the total energy of a sphere consists of two components @xcite .",
    "the first constant component is the energy of 12 pentagons .",
    "the sphere energy also includes the total curvature energy which is independent of the radius in this case ( because the number of atoms being proportional to squared curvature , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the second component is a correction excluding pentagonal bonds from the total count of curved bonds .",
    "therefore , the energy is as follows : @xmath18 where we introduce a characteristic number @xmath19 .",
    "the number @xmath20 includes the number of bonds belonging to the pentagonal rings in the fullerene ( cf . also @xcite ) and the ( dimensionless ) curvature of the surface times the ( dimensionless ) area of the sphere covered by hexagons .",
    "we took the experimental value of c@xmath21 formation energy from ref.@xcite and fitted our last parameter @xmath22  ev , which takes into account all 12 pentagons of the spheroidal closed cluster .",
    "the sphere energy evidently remains positive ( for the given model parameters @xmath23=0.9 ev and @xmath24 ) for the smallest spherical cluster considered here , @xmath16 .",
    "then , comparing the experimental formation energy of @xmath25 with our calculation , we find that the difference is about 1% and all three parameters are self  consistent .",
    "a sphere has the minimal curvature energy between closed nanoclusters of any definite number of atoms , @xmath26const .",
    "it seems interesting to compare the energies of * closed clusters * with the energy of * an open fragment * having dangling bonds . for an open cnc , the shorter the perimeter ( number of dangling bonds ) , the stronger the curvature .",
    "the decreasing energy of dangling bonds makes favourable a small rolled  up cluster with a shorter perimeter .",
    "the curvature energy demands that the cnc be extended and flat . as a result of the energy competition , the system decreases its total energy via elimination of dangling bonds owing to the fact that the infinitely large sphere is a configuration resulting in the global minimum of the total cnc energy @xcite .",
    "we consider below a sphere ( of area @xmath27 ) with a round hole of angular size @xmath28 varying from 0 to @xmath29 , from the sphere to the round piece of the plane ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this means that we choose a flat cnc with * the minimal perimeter * ( round ) and a closed cnc with * the minimal curvature * ( sphere ) at fixed area or number of atoms .",
    "we name an intermediate cluster `` an open sphere '' .",
    "the curvature energy decreases with the open sphere surface area as @xmath30 .",
    "this can be seen from the expression for the number of atoms in an ideal graphene sphere with a round hole : @xmath31 .",
    "it is also natural to feather out the dependence of the topological energy @xmath32 in the hole size @xmath28 ( actually varying stepwise , each step correspondes to creating a pentagonal defect ) and to substitute a linear dependence . instead of choosing a specific way to create a defect and to place it in the cluster lattice ,",
    "the simplest uniform distribution of pentagons over the open sphere surface is used here @xcite .",
    "this is nearly equivalent to placing pentagons as far apart as possible .",
    "the kinetics of the process @xcite is not touched on in this paper , as well as the pentagon ",
    "pentagon distance optimised elsewhere @xcite .    in terms of the independent variables @xmath6 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath1 and @xmath28 alternatively ) the energy of the open sphere reads as : @xmath33 \\right ) + \\displaystyle",

    "its meaning is discussed just below . the first term in eq.([open ] )",
    "is the energy of an incomplete sphere .",
    "the second is the dangling bond energy .",
    "of course , the accuracy of the model is poorer for small @xmath1 and strong curvature @xcite . as it is seen from figure 2 , the energy of the open sphere with hole size of neither 0 nor @xmath29 has a maximum at fixed number of atoms when @xmath35 .",
    "partial differentiation of eq.([open ] ) with respect to @xmath28 ( at fixed @xmath1 ) gives an analytical expression for the size of the open sphere with the maximal energy .",

    "let us consider a set of cncs with @xmath39 and @xmath40 : the energy of a cluster with @xmath41 grows in moving away from both extremities of this interval and has a maximum at @xmath42 .",
    "that is , going from @xmath38 to @xmath43 ( where the minimum of the energy occurs at fixed @xmath1 ) , we pass through a barrier of height @xmath44 decreasing with @xmath1 and tending to zero at @xmath0 . therefore , as follows from energy consideration solely , planar clusters with @xmath45 can be rolled up without any barrier . below @xmath0 ,",
    "the flat cnc is metastable to the rolling  up .",
    "suppose we have initially some distribution of planar graphite fragments @xmath46 ( which is consistent with the two  step  model of carbon cluster formation proposed in @xcite where nucleation and growth processes were separated ) .",
    "it is energetically favourable to increase the number of atoms , but this process depends on availability of the building material ( carbon atom concentration ) .",
    "one can suppose that in the second step of synthesis the only conformation is possible between different clusters ( even through some exchange of carbons ) .",
    "we consider below that the change in number of atoms is suppressed .",
    "suppose that the most energetically favourable process is rolling  up of a flat cnc into a sphere @xcite .",
    "then clusters with @xmath47 are rolled  up for energetical reason .",
    "at some finite temperature @xmath48 , the probability to roll up a smaller cluster is exponentially small : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the barrier height ( shown in figure 2 ) depending on @xmath1 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is the difference between the energy of the given flat cluster and that of a `` barrier '' cluster with the same number of atoms .    as a result of rolling  up",
    ", the initial size distribution of planar clusters is changed .",
    "we discussed above only a single path of conformation ( rolling  up into the spherical - shell cluster ) .",
    "for this reason we can only speculate about the distribution of the rest of planar clusters .",
    "it has a maximum depending on temperature and characteristic number of atoms in the initial distribution @xmath46 , being determined by the conditions of two distinct synthesis regimes and , therefore , treated as independent .    in summary , we proposed a heuristic model for calculating the energy of a carbon nanocluster formation . within the model",
    ", we use only three phenomenological parameters extracted from computer simulations and experimental data .",
    "the model allows evaluating the formation energies of various cncs and finding the preferable cluster shape .",
    "we compared the formation energies of the most preferable closed cluster ( spherical cluster ) and the most preferable flat fragment ( round piece of graphene ) .",
    "we conclude that for energy reasons rolling  up of a flat fragment is always favourable , since the energy of a closed cluster is the lowest .",
    "we predict that a small enough flat graphite cluster can be metastable with respect to rolling into a shell .",

    "the continual approach approximates well the exact atomic ( discrete ) result if a cnc has ( _ i _ ) small density of pentagonal defects , ( _ ii _ ) small and uniform curvature , and ( _ iii _ ) uniform distribution of dangling bonds along the open perimeter .",
    "the topological gauss - bonnet theorem allows creating a closed polyhedron with 3-coordinated vertices from any number of hexagons and exactly 12 pentagons .",
    "therefore , the energy parameter @xmath24 is named a topological one .",
    "the position of pentagonal defects in the energetically optimal cluster lattice is not known exactly .",
    "the isolated - pentagon - rule works for the closed clusters .",
    "even if we suppose uniform distribution to be valid for an open cluster , a possible reconstruction of the open perimeter is to be considered .",

    "it will have hexagonal angles on each `` tooth '' .",
    "the factor @xmath12 reflects the actual geometry , being 1 for a perfectly smooth perimeter with fixed minimal density of dangling bonds @xmath51 , equal to the `` zigzag '' tube density .    if one extrapolates eqs.([open ] ) and ( [ line ] ) to very small clusters ( @xmath52 ) , at least eq.([22 ] ) fails owing to the fact that all atoms belong to the pentagons and some of the bonds become inequivalent .",
