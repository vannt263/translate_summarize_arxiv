    "a tiling of the plane is a covering of @xmath0 by closed subsets , called tiles , such that the interiors of two distinct tiles are disjoint .",
    "one method of producing tilings is by substitution : a rule which expands each tile by a fixed amount and then breaks each expanded tile into smaller pieces , each of which is an isometric copy of an original tile .",
    "the most famous substitution tiling is the penrose tiling @xcite ; many other substitution tilings have been constructed and can be found online in the tilings encyclopedia @xcite .",
    "the study of substitution tilings is motivated by several disparate fields of mathematics and science .",
    "one thing they all have in common is that tilings are always constructed using a finite set of tiles called _ prototiles _ as their building blocks .",
    "the study of _ aperiodic _ prototile sets  finite prototile sets that can only form nonperiodic tilings  began with logician hao wang @xcite .",
    "he tied them to the decidability of the domino problem , which asks if there is an algorithm that can determine whether any given set of ( square ) prototiles , with specified edge matching rules , can tile the plane .",
    "he conjectured that the problem was decidable , but his conjecture depended upon non - existence of aperiodic prototile sets .",
    "wang s student robert berger @xcite proved the conjecture false by producing an aperiodic prototile set with 20,426 prototiles .",
    "it was the search for small aperiodic prototile sets that led penrose to discover his famous tiles .",
    "research on aperiodic tilings was purely academic until dan shechtman s nobel prize - winning discovery of quasicrystals @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "shechtman s discovery was predicted by alan l. mackay @xcite when he computed the diffraction of a penrose tiling .",
    "its ` impossible ' symmetry was found again in shectman s quasicrystal and it became clear that penrose tilings could be used as a mathematical model .",
    "diffraction patterns of quasicrystals are now modeled by the spectral theory of tiling spaces , in particular the dynamical spectrum of the translation operator ( see @xcite for a beautiful exposition of the most recent advances in this theory ) .",
    "the dynamical spectrum of tilings is best understood in the case of substitution tilings .",
    "an understanding of tiling spaces at this physical level led bellissard to his gap - labelling conjecture @xcite , which connects the spectral gaps of the schrdinger operator associated with a tiling space to the k - theory and cohomology of that space .",
    "bellissard s conjecture was proven independently in @xcite . by the same token ,",
    "tiling spaces provide interesting examples of @xmath1-algebras , and the geometry imposed by tilings makes them excellent candidates for study using connes noncommutative geometry program @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to establish a novel method for producing , from some given substitution tiling , infinitely many new substitution tilings .",
    "the method produces finite sets of prototiles which have fractal boundaries , so we call them _ fractal realizations _ of the original tiling .",
    "the construction depends on a synthesis of combinatorics and geometry in a way that has not previously been capitalized upon in the study of substitution tilings .",
    "moreover , it allows for hands - on experimentation with an infinitude of choices , and for now it is not completely clear the significance of making one choice over another . in @xcite , we gave a somewhat ad - hoc method for making a fractal realization of the pinwheel tiling . in this paper",
    "we show that a similar construction works for every primitive substitution tiling where tiles meet singly edge - to - edge and remove the ad - hoc nature of the construction in @xcite .",
    "one advantage to our method is that it provides access to some of the physical information described above .",
    "for instance , our new substitutions are easily made to _ force the border _ , an essential property for cohomology computations .",
    "when a tiling does not force the border , our method requires less information than the original approach in @xcite and uses the same amount of information , but is geometrically more elegant , than the most efficient known method @xcite .",
    "the real power behind our approach comes from the geometric information encoded in the new substitution , which we capitalize on by constructing spectral triples on the @xmath1-algebra of the original tiling space in @xcite . according to connes noncommutative geometry program @xcite",
    ", the existence of spectral triples implies that fractal realizations are defining a noncommutative riemannian geometry on the @xmath1-algebra of the original tiling space ( viewed as a noncommutative manifold ) .",
    "there are further interesting questions invoked by our fractal substitution tilings .",
    "for example , we give a formula for the fractal dimension of the boundary of the prototiles for any of our fractal tilings .",
    "but what information does the set of all possible fractal dimensions for a given tiling substitution carry ?",
    "the answer to this question seems to rely on a deep connection between the combinatorial graph - theoretic properties of the tiling and the geometric property of fractal dimension .",
    "further questions arise from a combinatorial standpoint ; for example , which substitution tilings admit _ combinatorial dual tilings _ that are also substitution tilings ?",
    "we provide sufficient conditions but have not yet been able to provide a complete characterization .",
    "our method of obtaining fractal substitution tilings is different than those that have appeared in the literature .",
    "for example , fractal tilings arise in the seminal work of kenyon @xcite characterizing the possible expansion factors for substitution tilings . since then fractal tilings have appeared many times , for instance in @xcite .",
    "our construction distinguishes itself from these in a few ways .",
    "the first is that we begin with a known substitution rule and construct an infinite family of substitutions whose tiling spaces are mutually locally derivable . in particular , we are able to construct substitution tilings that are mutually locally derivable to their original but with specified geometric properties that lend themselves more easily to computation .",
    "our construction differs , also , because it is not simply a redrawing of existing tiles but rather a recomposition that creates new tiles .",
    "we can understand , and indeed have some control over , the combinatorics of the new tiles within their tilings .",
    "the main tool in our construction is a _ recurrent pair _",
    "@xmath2 , which is a combinatorial and geometric structure that is compatible with the original substitution .",
    "the best way to illustrate how to construct a recurrent pair is with a simple example .",
    "we begin with a two - dimensional version of the thue - morse substitution rule , which we call the  2dtm \" substitution .",
    "it has two prototiles , labelled @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that are both unit squares .",
    "the substitution expands each prototile by a factor of four and replaces it with the patches shown in figure [ thue - morse - substitution ] .    to construct a recurrent pair @xmath5 ,",
    "we begin by embedding a planar graph @xmath6 into each of the prototiles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as shown on the left of figure [ 2dtm_graph_sub ] .",
    "note that we have chosen @xmath6 so that it has one vertex in the interior of each tile and connects to the interior of each edge .",
    "if @xmath6 were placed in every tile in an infinite tiling of these tiles , it would construct a new tiling that is combinatorially dual to the original .",
    "in general it is natural to start with such a dual graph for several reasons that will be outlined in this paper .",
    "next we construct a new graph @xmath7 on the prototiles by substituting the prototiles , this time without expanding , embedding the initial graph into each sub - tile , then selecting a subgraph @xmath7 that is combinatorially equivalent to the initial graph if we ignore all vertices of degree two . ] in figure [ 2dtm_graph_sub ] , the embedding stage is labelled @xmath8 , and the selection stage is labelled @xmath7 .",
    "we have made a choice of @xmath7 that breaks the inherent symmetry of the 2dtm tilings , but this was not necessary .",
