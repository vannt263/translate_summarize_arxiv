    "the availability of data sets at many energy points with centre of mass ( cms ) energies @xmath1  between 14 and 209 gev allows to separate the hard and soft contributions .",
    "the hard qcd processes , i.e. the radiation of gluons from the quarks produced at the electroweak vertex and subsequent higher order processes are well understood in perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "the production of multi - jet events is clear evidence for the existence of gluons and is successfully described by pqcd .",
    "the soft contributions to hadron production in @xmath0  annihilation are connected with the transition from the partons ( quarks and gluons ) generated by hard processes to the hadrons observed in the experiment .",
    "this transition is referred to as hadronisation and takes place at energy scales of approximately a light hadron mass , i.e. @xmath2  mev , where pqcd calculations are not reliable due to the rapid growth of the strong coupling @xmath3 .",
    "the soft contributions are known to scale like an inverse power of the cms energy ; for most observables the scaling is @xmath4 .",
    "at energy scales @xmath5 perturbative evolution of @xmath6  breaks down completely due to the landau pole at @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore impossible to attempt pqcd calculations of soft processes without further assumptions .    in order to clarify which assumptions",
    "are needed a phenomenological model of hadronisation is considered . the longitudinal phase space model or _ tube model",

    "the change to e.g. the observable thrust @xmath12  due to the production of a soft gluon at angle @xmath13 with transverse momentum @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "this observation is generalised to write the soft or non - perturbative contribution to the mean value of the @xmath12  distribution as follows : @xmath16 the function @xmath17 is the distribution of soft particles in @xmath18 .",
    "the first integral in equation  ( [ equ_tnp ] ) is summarised as @xmath19 independent of the observable and the second as a constant @xmath20 dependent on the observable .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 can only exist when @xmath22 is identified with a non - perturbative strong coupling @xmath23 which is assumed to be finite at low @xmath18  around and below the landau pole .",
    "a more formal approach to the origin of soft contributions is the study of infrared renormalons , i.e. the divergence of asymptotic pqcd predictions due to the integration of low momenta in quark loops in gluon lines  @xcite .",
    "the infrared renormalon divergence of the @xmath24  term in a pqcd prediction is factorial in @xmath25 : @xmath26 . with sterlings formula to replace @xmath27 one finds @xmath28 .",
    "the convergence of the series is optimal for @xmath29 .",
    "based on this relation one finds @xmath30 where the first order relation between @xmath3  and @xmath7  has been used .",

    "the main result for the effects of power corrections on distributions @xmath35 of the event shape observables @xmath12 , @xmath36  and @xmath37  is that the perturbative prediction @xmath38 is shifted  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40  is an observable dependent constant and @xmath41 is universal , i.e. independent of the observable  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath42 contains the @xmath43 scaling and the so - called milan - factor @xmath44 which takes two - loop effects into account . the non - perturbative parameter @xmath45  is explicitly matched with the perturbative strong coupling @xmath3 . for the event shape observables",

    "the dependence on the hadronisation model is reduced compared to traditional analyses relying on monte carlo models of hadronisation , because in the monte carlo models the colour factors are fixed  @xcite .    figure  [ fig_colrun ] ( top ) shows the results of simultaneous fits of @xmath50 , @xmath63  and one colour factor where the other colour factors have been kept fixed at their su(3 ) values .",
