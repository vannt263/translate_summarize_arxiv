    "age progression , also called age synthesis  @xcite or face aging  @xcite , is defined as aesthetically rendering a face image with natural aging and rejuvenating effects for an individual face .",
    "it has found application in some domains such as cross - age face analysis  @xcite , authentication systems , finding lost children , and entertainment .",
    "there are two main categories of solutions to the age progression task : prototyping - based age progression  @xcite and modeling - based age progression  @xcite .",
    "prototyping - based age progression transfers the differences between two prototypes ( e.g. , average faces ) of the pre - divided source age group and target age group into the input individual face , of which its age belongs to the source age group .",
    "modeling - based age progression models the facial parameters for the shape / texture synthesis with the actual age ( range ) .    intuitively , the natural aging process of a specific human usually follows the general rules in the aging process of all humans , but this specific process should also contain some personalized facial characteristics , e.g. , mole , birthmark , etc . , which are almost invariant with time .",
    "prototyping - based age progression methods can not well preserve this * personality * of an individual face , since they are based on the _ general _ rules in the human aging process for a relatively large population .",
    "modeling - based age progression methods do not specially consider these personalized details .",
    "moreover , they require dense * long - term * ( e.g. age span exceeds 20 years ) face aging sequences for building the complex models",
    ". however , collecting these dense long - term face aging sequences in the real world is very difficult or even unlikely .",
    "fortunately , we have observed that the short - term ( e.g. age span smaller than 10 years ) face aging sequences are available on the web , such as photos of celebrities of different ages on facebook / twitter .",
    "some available face aging databases  @xcite also contain the dense short - term sequences .",
    "therefore , generating personalized age progression for an individual input by leveraging short - term face aging sequences is more feasible .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an age progression method which automatically renders aging faces in a personalized way on a set of age - group specific dictionaries , as shown in figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "primarily , based on the aging-(in)variant patterns in the face aging process , an individual face can be decomposed into an aging layer and a personalized layer .",
    "the former shows the general aging characteristics ( e.g. , wrinkles ) , while the latter shows some personalized facial characteristics ( e.g. , mole ) . for different human age groups ( e.g. , 11 - 15 , 16 - 20 , ... ) ,",
    "we design corresponding aging dictionaries to characterize the human aging patterns , where the dictionary bases with the same index yet from different aging dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern ( e.g. , they are linked by a dotted line in figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the aging layer of the aging face can be represented by a linear combination of these patterns with a sparse coefficient ( e.g. , @xmath0 $ ] ) , where the redundancy between the aging layer and the input face can be defined as the personalized layer , which is invariant in the aging process .",
    "the motivation for the sparsity is to use fewer dictionary bases for reconstruction such that the reconstructed aging layer of face can be shaper and less blurred .",
    "finally , we render the aging face in the future age range for the individual input by synthesizing the represented aging layer in this age range and the personalized layer .",
    "to learn a set of aging dictionaries , we use the more practical short - term face aging pairs as the training set instead of the possibly unavailable long - term face aging sequences .",
    "based on the aging relationships between a face aging pair of the same person covering two neighboring age groups , we assume that the sparse representation of a younger - age face w.r.t .",
    "the younger - aging dictionary can represent its older - age face w.r.t . the older - aging dictionary , excluding the personalized layer .",
    "the distribution of face aging pairs is shown in the upper part of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we can see that : ( 1 )  each age group has its own aging dictionary , and every two neighboring age groups are linked by the collected dense short - term face aging pairs ; ( 2 )  one particular may appear in two different neighboring - group face pairs , which makes all the age groups linked together ; ( 3 )  the personalized details ( the personalized layer ) contain the personalized facial characteristics .",
    "these three properties are able to guarantee that all aging dictionaries can be simultaneously trained well by a personality - aware coupled reconstruction loss on the short - term face aging pairs .",
    "our main contributions in this paper are two - fold : ( 1 )  we propose a personalized age progression method to render aging faces , which can preserve the personalized facial characteristics ; ( 2 )  since it is challenging or even impossible to collect intra - person face sequences of all age groups , the proposed method only requires the available short - term face aging pairs to learn all aging dictionary bases of human aging , which is more feasible .",
    "extensive experiments well validate the advantage of our proposed solution over other state - of - the - arts w.r.t .",
    "personalized aging progression , as well as the performance gain for cross - age face verification by synthesizing aging faces .",
    "age progression has been comprehensively reviewed in literature  @xcite . as one of the early studies , burt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite focused on creating average faces for different ages and transferring the facial differences between the average faces into the input face .",
    "this method gave an insight into the age progression task .",
    "thereafter , some prototyping - based aging methods  @xcite were proposed with different degrees of improvements . in particular ,",
    "the paper  @xcite leveraged the difference between the warped average faces ( instead of the original average faces ) based on the flow from average face to input face .",
    "a drawback of these methods is that the aging speed for each human is synchronous and no personalized characteristic is saved , which leads to similar aging results of many faces to each other .",
    "although some researchers target at individual - specific face aging  @xcite , lack of personality for aging faces is still a challenging problem .",
    "modeling - based age progression which considers shape and texture synthesis simultaneously is another popular idea  @xcite .",
    "there have been quite a quantity of modeling - based age progression methods proposed , including active appearance model  @xcite , craniofacial growth model  @xcite , and - or graph model  @xcite , statistical model  @xcite and implicit function  @xcite , etc .",
    "generally , to model large appearance changes over a long - term face aging sequence , modeling - based age progression requires sufficient training data .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite attempted to learn long - term aging patterns from available short - term aging databases by a proposed concatenational graph evolution aging model .",
    "the framework of the proposed personalized age progression is plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the offline phase is described as follows .",
    "first , we collect the dense short - term aging pairs of the same persons from the web and also from available databases .",
    "second , for each age group , we design a corresponding aging dictionary to represent its aging characteristics .",
    "third , all aging dictionaries are simultaneously trained by a personality - aware coupled dictionary learning model on the collected database . in the online phase , for an input face ,",
    "we first construct the aging face in the nearest neighboring age group by the corresponding aging dictionary with an implicitly common coefficient , as well as a personalized layer .",
    "after that , taking this new aging face as the input of aging synthesis in the next age group , we repeat this process until all aging faces have been rendered .",
    "more details will be described in section  [ aps ] .",
    "we divide the human aging process into @xmath1 age groups ( each group spans less than 10 years ) in this paper .",

    "* we adopt three strategies to comprehensively evaluate the proposed age progression .",
    "first , we qualitatively evaluate the proposed method on the fgnet database  @xcite , which is a publicly available database and has been widely used for evaluating face aging methods .",
    "this database contains 1,002 images of 82 persons , and the age range spans from 0 to 69 : about 64% of the images are from children ( with ages @xmath119 18 ) , and around 36% are from adults ( with ages @xmath120 18 ) .",
    "we show the age progression for every photo in the fgnet dataset , and do qualitative comparison with the corresponding ground truth ( available older photo ) for each person . for reference",
    ", we also reproduce some aging results of other representative methods .",
    "second , we conduct user study to test the aging faces of our method compared with the prior works which reported their best aging results .",
    "our method uses the same inputs as in these prior works .",
    "third , cross - age face recognition  @xcite and cross - age face verification  @xcite are challenging in extreme facial analysis scenarios due to the age gap .",
    "a straightforward way for cross - age facial analysis is to use the aging synthesis to normalize the age gap .",
    "specifically , we can render all the faces to their aging faces within the same age range , and then employ the existing algorithms to conduct face verification .",
    "inspired by this , we can also use the face verification algorithm to prove that the pair of aging face and ground truth face ( without age gap ) is more similar than the original face pair with age gap .",
    "we take each photo in fgnet as the input of our age progression .",
    "to well illustrate the performance of the proposed age progression , we compare our results with the released results in an online fun demo : face transformer demo ( ft demo ) , and also with those by a state - of - the - art age progression method : illumination - aware age progression ( iaap )  @xcite .",
    "by leveraging thousands of web photos across age groups , the authors of iaap presented a prototyping - based age progression method for automatic age progression of a single photo .",
    "ft demo requires manual location of facial features , while iaap uses the common aging characteristics of average faces for the age progression of all input faces .",
    "some aging examples are given in figure  [ fig4 ] , covering from baby / childhood / teenager ( input ) to adult / agedness ( output ) , as well as from adult ( input ) to agedness ( output ) . by comparing with ground truth",
    ", we can see that the aging results of our method look more like the ground truth faces than the aging results of other two methods .",
    "in particular , our method can generate personalized aging faces for different individual inputs . in terms of texture change ,",
    "the aging face of ours in figure  [ fig4](a ) has white mustache that is closer to ground truth ; in shape change , the aging faces of ours in figure  [ fig4](b)(e)(f ) have more approximate facial outline to the ground truth ; in aging speed , the faces of ft demo and iaap in figure  [ fig4](c ) are aging more slowly , while one of ft demo in figure  [ fig4](d ) is faster . overall , the age speed of iaap is slower than ground truth since iaap is based on smoothed average faces , which maybe loses some facial textual details , such as freckle , nevus , aging spots , etc .",
    "ft demo performs the worst , especially in shape change .",
    "our aging results in figure  [ fig4 ] are more similar to the ground truth , which means our method can produce much more personalized results .",
    "some prior works on age progression have posted their best face aging results with inputs of different ages , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are 246 aging results with 72 inputs in total . our age progression for each input",
    "is implemented to generate the aging results with the same ages ( ranges ) of the posted results .",
    "we conduct user study to compare our aging results with the published aging results . to avoid bias as much as possible",
    ", we invite 50 adult participants covering a wide age range and from all walks of life . they are asked to observe each comparison group including an input face , and two aging results ( named  a \" and  b \" ) in a random order , and tell which aging face is better in terms of _ personality _ and _ reliability_. _ reliability _ means the aging face should be natural and authentic in the synthetic age , while _ personality _ means the aging faces for different inputs should be identity - preserved and diverse . all users are asked to give the comparison of two aging faces using four schemes :  a is better \" ,  b is better \" ,  comparable `` , and ' ' neither is accepted \" , respectively . we convert the results into ratings to quantify the results .",
    "there are 50 ratings for each comparison , 246 comparison groups , and then 12,300 ratings in total .",
    "the voting results are as follows : 45.35% for ours better ; 36.45% for prior works better ; and 18.20% for  comparable \" ; @xmath121 for  neither is accepted \" .",
    "the voting results demonstrate that our method is superior to prior works .",
    "we also show some comparison groups for voting in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "overall , for the input face of a person in any age range , our method and these prior works can generate an authentic and reliable aging face of any older - age range .",
    "this is consistent with the gained relatively - high voting support . in particular , for different inputs , our rendered aging faces have more personalized aging characteristics , which further improves the appealing visual sense .",
    "for example in figure [ fig5 ] , the aging faces of ours in the same age range in the @xmath122st and the @xmath123nd group of the @xmath122st row have different aging speeds : the former is obviously slower than the latter ; the aging faces of prior works with different inputs in the @xmath122st and @xmath123nd groups of the @xmath124rd column are similar , while our aging results are more diverse for different individual inputs .          to validate the improved performance of cross - age face verification with the help of the proposed age progression , we prepare the intra - person pairs and inter - person pairs with cross ages on the fgnet database . by removing undetected face photos and face pairs with age span no more than 20 years , we select 1,832 pairs ( 916 intra - person pairs and 916 inter - person pairs ) , called  original pairs \" . among the 1,832 pairs , we render the younger face in each pair to the aging face with the same age of the older face by our age progression method . replacing each younger face with the corresponding aging face , we newly construct 1,832 pairs of aging face and older face , called  our synthetic pairs \" . for fair comparison",
    ", we further define  our synthetic pairs - slowromancap1@ \" as using the given tag labels of fgnet , while  our synthetic pairs - slowromancap2@ \" is using the estimated gender and age from a facial trait recognition system  @xcite . to evaluate the performance of our age progression",
    ", we also prepare the  iaap synthetic pairs - slowromancap1@ \" and  iaap synthetic pairs - slowromancap2@ \" by the state - of - the - art age progression method in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig6a ] plots the pair setting .",
    "the detailed implementation of face verification is given as follows .",
    "first , we formulate a face verification model with deep convolutional neural networks ( deep convnets ) , which is based on the deepid2 algorithm  @xcite .",
    "since we focus on the age progression in this paper , please refer to  @xcite for more details of face verification with deep convnets .",
    "second , we train our face verification model on the lfw database  @xcite , which is designed for face verification .",
    "third , we test the face verification on original pairs , iaap synthetic pairs and our synthetic pairs , respectively .    the false acceptance rate - false rejection rate ( far - frr ) curves and the equal error rates ( eer ) on original pairs and synthetic pairs are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "we can see that the face verification on our synthetic pairs achieves lower err than on original pairs and iaap synthetic pairs .",
    "this illustrates that the aging faces by our method can effectively mitigate the effect of age gap in cross - age face verification .",
    "the results also validate that , for an given input face , our method can render a personalized and authentic aging face closer to the ground truth than the iaap method .",
    "since the estimated age for an individual is more consistent with human aging tendency , our / iaap synthetic pairs - slowromancap2@ outperforms our / iaap synthetic pairs - slowromancap1@.",
    "in this paper , we proposed a personalized age progression method . basically , we design multiple aging dictionaries for different age groups , in which the aging bases from different dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern across different age groups , and a linear combination of these patterns expresses a particular aging process . moreover ,",
    "we define the aging layer and the personalized layer for an individual to capture the aging characteristics and the personalized characteristics , respectively . we simultaneously train all aging dictionaries on the collected short - term aging database .",
    "specifically , in two arbitrary neighboring age groups , the younger- and older - age face pairs of the same persons are used to train coupled aging dictionaries with the common sparse coefficients , excluding the specific personalized layer . for an input face",

    "<S> in this paper , we aim to automatically render aging faces in a personalized way . </S>",
    "<S> basically , a set of age - group specific dictionaries are learned , where the dictionary bases corresponding to the same index yet from different dictionaries form a particular aging process pattern cross different age groups , and a linear combination of these patterns expresses a particular personalized aging process . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , two factors are taken into consideration in the dictionary learning process . </S>",
    "<S> first , beyond the aging dictionaries , each subject may have extra personalized facial characteristics , e.g. mole , which are invariant in the aging process . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is challenging or even impossible to collect faces of all age groups for a particular subject , yet much easier and more practical to get face pairs from neighboring age groups . </S>",
    "<S> thus a personality - aware coupled reconstruction loss is utilized to learn the dictionaries based on face pairs from neighboring age groups . </S>",
    "<S> extensive experiments well demonstrate the advantages of our proposed solution over other state - of - the - arts in term of personalized aging progression , as well as the performance gain for cross - age face verification by synthesizing aging faces . </S>"
