    "the negative electron affinity ( nea ) state of activated ( 100 ) gaas has been widely studied and used for a variety of applications . while the qualitative features of the electron photoemission are known ,",
    "a full quantitative understanding is lacking @xcite .",
    "the co - adsorption of cs and o ( or f ) on an atomically clean surface of @xmath0-type gaas is known to result in a significant lowering of the gaas electron affinity as well as a shift of the surface fermi level deep into the band gap with a formation of the band bending region ( bbr ) near the surface .",
    "the band - bending is an important contribution to the lowering of the electron affinity .",
    "the emitted electron energy distribution depends on the density of states , the doping level and the electron kinetics in the bbr , leading to differing interpretations of the electron energy distribution ( edc ) curves @xcite .",
    "while the activated surface develops a surface barrier for the electrons , the structure and transparency of the barrier is not well understood .",
    "information on the properties of the nea surface is obtained with photoemission studies at high power excitation @xcite . when the photocathode is excited with high densities of light near the band gap",
    ", the total photoemitted charge is not proportional to the light intensity .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed using bulk gaas @xcite , and can be described as a surface charge limit ( scl ) .",
    "several experimental studies have been made on strained gaas@xcite , superlattice structures @xcite , and thin unstrained gaas @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the scl was attributed to the photovoltage building up in the band bending region .",
    "the photoelectrons captured in the bbr produce an opposing field that flattens the bands and reduces nea , which can be described as the effect of the surface photovoltage ( spv ) .",
    "it was determined that spv formation and its relaxation is mainly controlled by the restoring current of the holes @xcite and is very sensitive to the transparency of the barrier for the holes formed by the bbr @xcite .",
    "the value of the surface photovoltage at several temperatures for a ( 100 ) gaas surface has been measured in studies of core - level photoemission spectra under synchrotron radiation excitation @xcite and in studies of the edc at high excitation levels @xcite .    the problem of the scl is important for operation of polarized electron photocathodes at the stanford linear collider ( slc)@xcite and even more so for the next generation linear colliders such as the next linear collider ( nlc)@xcite .",
    "the present nlc design requires a train of 95 microbunches spaced 2.8 ns apart .",
    "each microbunch is required to have @xmath5 electrons with a peak current of 4.5 a , totaling @xmath6 electrons in a 266 ns train .",
    "the required total charge is two orders of magnitude higher than the slc case .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on the first detailed experimental studies and theoretical analysis for a set of 100 nm - thick gaas samples with various levels of uniform doping . for thin - layer cathodes",
    "the time of electron extraction from the active layer to the bbr is much smaller than the bulk lifetime and the diffusion time , eliminating the influence of the recombination effects in the layer .",
    "the optical properties of unstrained gaas are fairly well known , allowing reliable estimation of the surface escape probability from the experimental data . using long - pulse excitation and pump - probe measurements , the kinetics of photovoltage buildup and electron emission are investigated .",
    "fig . 1 shows schematically the gaas band structure near the surface activated by cs(o / f ) deposition and the electron potential near the surface . when the cathode is illuminated with a pulsed laser with photon energy slightly above the band gap energy , the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band are rapidly thermalized and captured in the bbr potential well from which they tunnel into vacuum through the surface barrier . for a thin unstrained gaas layer ( @xmath7 ,   @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the optical absorption coefficient",
    ", @xmath10 is the active layer thickness , @xmath11 is the diffusion length ) all the electrons optically excited in the gaas layer near the absorption edge are captured in the bbr region forming the flow of the electrons to the surface , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the light excitation intensity and @xmath14 is the surface optical reflection coefficient . a part of this flow is emitted into vacuum , while the rest contributes to the surface recombination current , so that the quantum yield y is@xcite : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the surface escape probability .",
    "the value of @xmath16 depends on the details of the competition between electron recombination in the bbr and emission into vacuum through the surface barrier .",
    "to estimate local values of @xmath16 on the activated surface we use the results of near band gap low - intensity measurements of the quantum yield for a small excitation spot . taking @xmath17 cm , @xmath18=0.68 and @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath21 for a typical quantum yield of a thin gaas layer of @xmath22 = 0.5% .",
    "thus , even at the low - intensity excitation only @xmath23th of the electron flow to the surface is photoemitted into vacuum , and the majority recombines in the band bending region .",
    "the quantum yield from nea surfaces increases with bias field at the gaas surface @xcite .",
    "this effect is attributed traditionally to the image - force lowering of the surface barrier by the applied field ( see fig .",
    "this barrier lowering , @xmath24 , can be evaluated from a simple electrostatic consideration : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the free electron charge , @xmath27 is the external electric field , and @xmath28 is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor . the quantity @xmath29 is seen to be proportional to the square root of the bias field .",
    "more commonly , this effect is studied for surfaces having positive electron affinity or schottky barriers , where the image force modifies the thermionic emission current .",
    "the emission current is then an exponential function of the barrier height , so that @xmath30 grows linearly with the square root of applied bias field . for nea photocathodes , both linear@xcite and logarithmic@xcite dependences of @xmath22 on the square root of the bias field",
    "have been observed . in appendix a an expression for the surface escape probability @xmath16 is derived . for the conditions of this experiment the dependence of @xmath16 on the nea value @xmath31 is shown to be linear . from these considerations",
    "it follows that the relative variation of the yield with the bias field f is given by : @xmath32      under intense optical excitation the electron flow to the surface starts to compensate the positive charge of the donor - like states that provide band bending at the surface .",
    "this results in a flattening of the energy bands and a lifting of the bottom of the conduction band at the surface ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "one can assume that the properties of the resulting effective surface barrier in the several monolayer - thick activation layer are not influenced by this relatively small shift .",
    "one can further assume that the electron diffusion to the band bending region does not change since it remains faster than the surface processes .",
    "the change in quantum yield can then be evaluated if one replaces the nea value @xmath31 by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the up - shifting of the conduction band due to the photovoltage .",
    "taking into account the bias field effect , we obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the nea value recalculated for a given bias field , @xmath24 is the potential barrier lowering resulting from an external bias field , and @xmath37 is the quantum yield for non charge - limited photoemission .      when the excited electrons are captured in the bbr , the majority of electrons recombine at the surface with the holes coming from the valence band . there are several mechanisms for electron recombination ( starting from the recombination in the band bending region itself ) . however , for activated gaas surfaces the electron capture by surface localized states appears to be the fastest process since the electrons drift in the strong electric field to these capture centers , which have an attractive coulomb potential",
    ". therefore the recombination rate of these electrons is limited by the excess hole current to the surface , @xmath38 . in the stationary state where the excitation time is much longer than the surface process time",
    ", the spv value can be evaluated from the balance of the surface current densities , @xmath39 .",
    "there are two major mechanisms providing the recombination hole current to the surface through the band bending region : thermionic emission and tunneling through the barrier .",
    "the photovoltage dependence of the hole current at low temperatures tracks with the tunneling contribution , while at higher temperatures the hole current increases due to the thermal shift of the hole energy distribution , which assists hole tunneling through the barrier . in the equilibrium state with no illumination ,",
    "the excess hole current equals zero at the equilibrium band bending .",
    "therefore , the resulting excess current @xmath40 can be expressed as@xcite : @xmath41 , \\label{eq : jhou}\\ ] ] where the energy @xmath42 for the band bending region is given by : @xmath43^{1/2}= 18.57\\times\\left[\\frac{n_a}{m_h\\epsilon_s}\\right]^{1/2 } { \\rm mev } , \\label{eq : eoo}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the hole mass , and @xmath45 is the acceptor concentration in the unit of 10@xmath2 @xmath3 . for the case of thermally assisted tunneling in metal - semiconductor junctions , @xmath46 can be expressed as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath49 is the effective richardson constant , @xmath49 = 9.6 a k@xmath50 cm@xmath50 , for tunneling by light holes .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eoo ] ) that for gaas and a typical doping level of 5@xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath3 , the value of @xmath52 can vary from 17 mev to 40 mev depending on the relative contribution of the light and heavy holes into the hole current . however , the light hole contribution to @xmath40 is dominant due to the mass dependence of the @xmath46 factor .",
    "the above expression for @xmath46 is in the context of a schottky barrier model with a metallic layer and thus may be different for cesiated nea gaas surfaces .",
    "the samples for the present experiment were grown by the quantum epitaxial devices corporation @xcite using molecular - beam - epitaxy ( mbe ) . the substrate material was ( 100 ) _",
    "n_-type ( si doped to 1@xmath110@xmath2@xmath3 ) gaas .",
    "since heavy _",
    "p_-type doping is necessary to achieve a nea surface , a 0.1-@xmath53m - thick _ p_-type gaas ( be doped to 5@xmath110@xmath2@xmath3 ) layer was first grown on the substrate , followed by a 1-@xmath53m - thick _ p_-type ( be doped to 5@xmath110@xmath2@xmath3 ) al@xmath54ga@xmath55as buffer layer .",
    "the 0.1-@xmath53m - thick _ p_-type gaas active layer was then grown on this buffer .",
    "four samples were grown with uniform doping concentrations of 5@xmath110@xmath2@xmath3 , 1@xmath110@xmath4@xmath3 , 2@xmath110@xmath4@xmath3 , and 5@xmath110@xmath4@xmath3 in the active layer respectively .",
    "the al@xmath54ga@xmath55as intermediate layer serves as a potential barrier to isolate the active gaas layer from the substrate gaas . in order to preserve an atomically clean surface",
    "the samples were anodized to form an oxide layer of about 50    on the gaas surface@xcite .",
    "the oxide layer was later removed as described below .",
    "the relevant sample parameters are tabulated in table i.    the experiments were performed at the gun test laboratory at slac @xcite . the apparatus , which is a replica of the first few meters of the slac injector beamline , consists of a 22.5 mm diameter photocathode diode gun with a load - lock system for cathode loading / removal , and an electron beamline terminating into a faraday cup .",
    "prior to installation in the system , the sample was degreased in a boiling solution of trichloroethane . after the protective oxide layer",
    "was removed in ammonium hydroxide , the sample was rinsed in distilled water and methanol .",
    "the load - lock system was essential for loading the samples into and removing them from the gun under vacuum .",
    "this system avoided the cathode contamination that normally accompanies the bake of the gun system , resulting in reproducible cathode activations and high quantum yield .",
    "the cathode activation to obtain an nea surface consisted of heat cleaning to 600 @xmath56c for 1 hour , followed by application of cesium until the photoyield peaked , and then cesium and nitrogen - trifluoride codeposition until the photoyield was again maximized .",
    "two different excitation sources were used for the two types of measurements .",
    "the first type of measurement used a flash - lamp pumped ti : sapphire laser ( flash - ti ) producing a long laser pulse adjustable from 150 - 350 ns at 120 hz with energy up to 130 @xmath53j .",
    "this excitation mode was used to directly study the time evolution of the photovoltage and the dependence of the photovoltage on the laser intensity .",
    "the second type of measurement used two pulsed ti : sapphire lasers pumped by a single frequency - doubled nd : yag laser ( yag - ti ) in a pump - pulse / probe - pulse combination . in this excitation mode",
    "the pump - pulse was an intense short pulse inducing a photovoltage in the photocathode followed by a short high intensity probe - pulse , but not in the intensity regime to produce a photovoltage effect .",
    "the two yag - ti lasers each produced a 2 ns pulse at 60 hz with a pump laser energy of up to 100 @xmath53j . in these measurements , the time separation between the pump and probe laser pulses was varied .",
    "this technique allowed an independent measurement of the photovoltage parameters .",
    "all laser wavelengths were 850 nm , and the spot size was set to about 20 mm so as to fill the exposed area of the cathode .",
    "an optically isolated nanoammeter , a beam position monitor ( bpm ) , a ceramic gap monitor , and a fast faraday cup were used for beam intensity measurements .",
    "the cathode was biased at @xmath57 kv and maintained at a temperature of 0 @xmath58 2@xmath56 c. the vacuum in the gun was maintained at about 1x10@xmath59 torr by means of ion and nonevaporative getter pumping .",
    "two low - power cw diode lasers of 833 nm and 850 nm were used for the low power quantum yield measurements . for an individual sample , the quantum yield typically varied by a factor of two over the surface , but in some cases as high as a factor five .",
    "these variations were presumably caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of cesium on the surface .",
    "similar variations were reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "the quantum yield values averaged over the surface for the individual samples are shown in table 1 .",

    "2 shows the experimentally observed variation of the quantum yield with the bias field for sample 1a , sample 3 , and two other photocathodes not used for the present experiment .",
    "these two additional samples were zinc - doped strained gaas and carbon - doped 1 @xmath53 m thick gaas .",
