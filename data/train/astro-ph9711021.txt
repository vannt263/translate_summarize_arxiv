    "the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae stars @xmath0 is an indicator of distance and age in the galaxy . in particular",
    "it is a key parameter for determining the age of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) which should place a lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "however , the values of @xmath0 reported so far defies a consensus and splits into faint and bright values .    the faint value of @xmath0=0.700.75 at the characteristic halo metallicity [ fe / h]=1.6 , which gives a shorter distance scale or larger age of clusters , is derived from halo rr lyraes in the fields by the statistical parallax method ( hawley et al .",
    "1986 ; barnes & hawley 1986 ; strugnell , reid , & murray 1986 ; layden et al .  1996 ) and by the baade - wesselink analysis ( liu & janes 1990a ; jones et al .",
    "1992 ) . on the other hand , the bright value of @xmath4=0.44 at [ fe / h]=1.9 , which gives a longer distance scale or smaller age , is derived from rr lyraes in the gcs of the lmc , assuming a distance modulus to the lmc to be 18.5 ( walker 1992 ) .",
    "sandage s pulsation theory ( sandage 1993 ) and rr lyraes in the metal - poor gcs of m5 and m92 ( storm , carney , & latham 1994 ) also support the bright value , but this is not the case for rr lyares in m4 ( liu & janes 1990b ) .    such a dichotomy in current estimates of @xmath13(rr ) is the dominant source of uncertainty in the age determination of gcs .",
    "the faint @xmath0 raises a well - known problem such that the age of gcs exceeds the age of the universe if the hubble constant is adopted as @xmath14km@xmath15s@xmath16mpc@xmath17 , and this is the central argument in favor of nonzero cosmological constant ( bolte & hogan 1995 ) .",
    "however , a possibility of swaying back to the bright @xmath4 has recently been discussed since the preference of its bright value was inferred from the hipparcos measurements of parallaxes of cepheids ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) and subdwarfs ( reid 1997 ) .",
    "the astrometric observations of field rr lyraes have been available to us as a part of the hipparcos programme assigned to the proposers in 1982 .",
    "this paper is therefore the first report in the main journal on the _ direct _ determination of @xmath0 from statistical treatments of hipparcos proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes of rr lyraes ( cf . ,",
    "tsujimoto , miyamoto , & yoshii 1997 ; fernley et al .",
    "the derived results from the proper motions in  2 and from the parallaxes in  3 have confirmed the faint @xmath0 , thus suggesting that the so - called age discrepancy would not be resolved or alleviated yet .",
    "the hipparcos proper motion system is inertial , on a global sense , within the error @xmath7 0.25 mas / yr and the mean error @xmath18 of the hipparcos proper motions [ @xmath19 , @xmath20 for the rr lyraes considered here is [ @xmath73 mas / yr , @xmath72 mas / yr ] .",
    "thus , the previous proper motions are remarkably improved by the hipparcos mission .",
    "the most essential part of improvements of the previous proper motions [ @xmath21 , @xmath22 may be described by the rotation vector of the previous proper motion system with respect to the hipparcos system .",

    "introducing a model that predicts the spatial motion of each star at each position in the galaxy , we estimate the model parameters by the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the present model includes a reflex solar motion with respect to the galactic center and an ellipsoidal velocity distribution for rr lyraes , but neglects the differential galactic rotation . assuming that the velocity residuals , the observed velocity minus the velocity expected from the model , follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean , we have the logarithmic likelihood @xmath36 of the aggregate of all the residuals :    @xmath37    where is the covariance tensor given by the expectation = @xmath2@xmath3 .",

    "the results are shown in table 1 .",

    "in general , a linear relation between @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] has been assumed .",
    "the slope of @xmath0[fe / h ] relation has a strong influence on the inferred age differences among the globular clusters , which give a measure of the dynamical timescale for halo formation .",
    "the baade - wesselink results give the values of @xmath4 over the range of [ fe / h]= 2.2 to 0 , which are fitted by the relation : @xmath0 = ( 1.02@xmath70.03)+(0.16@xmath70.03)[fe / h ] ( jones et al .",
    "1992 ) or @xmath0 = ( 1.04@xmath70.10)+(0.21@xmath70.05)[fe / h ] ( skillen et al .  1992 ) . however , the controversial situation holds also for determining the slope of @xmath0[fe / h ] relation .",

    "the relative error @xmath56 for 173 hipparcos rr lyraes with the standard error @xmath57 of hipparcos parallaxes @xmath58 distributes such that each number of stars with @xmath56 less than 1 and larger than 1 is 51 and 65 , respectively .",
    "the remaining 57 stars have even negative parallaxes .",
    "thus , almost all of the parallaxes are measured with very large error , except one case ( hip95497=rr lyr ) with @xmath56 = 0.135 . in figure 1 hipparcos parallaxes @xmath58",

    "the filled and open circles in the figure indicate the parallaxes with @xmath56 smaller than 1 and others , respectively .",
    "it is noticed that the individual deviation of hipparcos parallaxes from the photometric ones is extremely large , but hipparcos parallaxes including low quality and negative ones as a whole agree with the photometric ones .",
    "the statistical properties of hipparcos parallaxes of their errors have been investigated extensively by arenou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who have shown that hipparcos parallaxes are free from any global zero - point error up to @xmath64 mas and their errors are normally distributed with zero mean .",
    "this means that hipparcos parallaxes including even the negative ones for any ensemble of stars are statistically well - behaved .",
    "this is the case for the ensemble of rr lyraes as well , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "these statistical regularities of hipparcos parallaxes suggest a relevant technique for estimating statistically the absolute magnitude @xmath0 of rr lyraes to be applicable to the ensemble of rr lyrae parallaxes , even though each individual parallax measured is largely erroneous , giving negative one as well . here",
    "we attempt to derive @xmath0 directly from hipparcos parallaxes , relying upon two statistical methods to find the unbiased estimate .",
    "\\a ) lutz - kelker correction    lutz & kelker ( 1973 ) have shown that only when the relative error @xmath65 is smaller than 0.175 , an unbiased estimate of the absolute magnitude can be retrieved from the measured parallaxes @xmath66 .",
    "we have only one case of hip95497 with @xmath67 , to which lutz - kelker correction is applicable .",
    "the uncorrected absolute magnitude of this star is @xmath13(rr ) = @xmath68 , which is derived formally from the measured parallax . on the basis of hanson s ( 1979 )",
    "formulation to estimate the correction , we have the calibrated absolute magnitude range @xmath4 = ( 0.620.72)@xmath5 for hip95497 ( [ fe / h]=1.37 ) , corresponding to the assumed spatial density of rr lyraes @xmath69=const . and @xmath70 as the lower and upper bounds , respectively .",
    "if we assume @xmath54=0.20 in eq.[4 ] , the above range of @xmath0 for hip95497 corresponds to @xmath0 = ( 0.580.68)@xmath5 at [ fe / h]=1.6 .",
    "\\b ) maximum likelihood calibration    in order to retrieve statistically an unbiased estimate of the absolute magnitude together with its intrinsic dispersion for a single luminosity class of magnitude limited stars from their measured parallaxes with errors , smith ( 1987,88 ) has proposed a maximum likelihood principle for correcting simultaneously the malmquist bias and the lutz - kelker bias , allowing full use of low accuracy and negative parallaxes .    in line with the above principle we attempt to find the best esimate of the absolute magnitude @xmath0 and of the intrinsic magnitude dispersion @xmath44 for 125 hipparcos rr lyraes in the metallicity range 2.49@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath60.07 .",
    "we use here the numerical algorithm developed by ratunatunga & casertano ( 1991 ) . maximizing the likelihood function given by the product of the probabilities @xmath71 of",
    "all the rr lyraes considered , we obtain the best estimate of @xmath44 , @xmath62 and @xmath54 in eq.[4 ] , where we adopt @xmath63 = 1.60 , taking into account the fact that the present distribution of rr lyraes shows a peak at [ fe / h]@xmath101.6 . setting the allowable range of the measured parallaxes as [ @xmath72,@xmath73=[@xmath74,@xmath75 , and assuming the number density of rr lyraes in space to be constant , we find the @xmath0-[fe / h ] relation : @xmath76 + 1.60)\\ ] ] with @xmath77 .",
    "it is noticed that although the errors in the parameters estimated are large , the present @xmath0-[fe / h ] relation shows a formal agreement with the preferred relation @xmath78 $ ] proposed by chaboyer , demarque , & sarajedini ( 1996 ) without quoting error estimates .",
    "the insensitivity of the relation given by eq.[5 ] has been checked by putting @xmath44 = 0.10.2 ( layden et al .",
    "1996 ) , [ @xmath72,@xmath73=[0,@xmath75 , and @xmath70 ( reid 1997 ) , respectively .",
    "the large standard errors in eq.[5 ] are owing to the small numbers of degrees of freedom in the present statistics .",
    "to increase the freedom , putting @xmath54=0 in eq.[4 ] , we apply the same method to the 99 halo rr lyraes with @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath3=1.58 , whose absolute magnitude has been determined already on the basis of the statistical parallax method .",
    "then , we find @xmath8=0.65@xmath70.33 and @xmath44=4.1@xmath79 at @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath3=1.58 . this absolute magnitude can be compared with @xmath4=0.59@xmath70.37 at [ fe / h]=1.6 given by eq.[5 ] . the validity of the present statistical analysis has been further checked by inspecting the distribution @xmath80 for the 125 rr lyrae stars .",
    "the median of the distribution is shifted only by 0.08 from the gaussian .",
    "the present derivation of the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae stars is twofold , relying upon hipparcos proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "first , applying the statistical parallax method to hipparcos proper motions of 99 halo rr lyraes , we have found      second , applying the lutz - kelker correction to the most accurate parallax of hip95497 ( rr lyr ) with @xmath56=0.135 and [ fe / h]=1.37 , we have the magnitude range @xmath4=(0.620.72)@xmath5 , which yields      given the slope 0.20 of the @xmath0-[fe / h ] relation .",
    "the lower and upper bounds in eq.[7 ] correspond to the assumed spatial density of rr lyraes @xmath69=const .  and",
    "@xmath70 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , applyng the maximum likelihood algorithm to hipparcos parallaxes including low accuracy and negative ones as well for 125 rr lyraes with 2.49@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath60.07 , we have found the relation ( 5 ) which gives @xmath83}=-1.6 \\ \\ \\ .\\ ] ]        although the trigonometric parallax results have large errors , these results are consistent with the statistical parallax result .",
    "all of the four results suggest the fainter absolute magnitude , @xmath0@xmath100.60.7 at [ fe / h]=1.6 .",
    "note that three estimates from parallaxes eqs.[7]-[9 ] are not completely independent , in regorous sense .",
    "recently , feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) find @xmath0 = 0.25 at [ fe / h]=1.9 , combining the lmc distance modulus of 18.7 determined by hipparcos parallaxes of cepheids with the data of lmc rr lyraes by walker ( 1992 ) . on the other hand , ried ( 1997 )",
    "estimates the distance scale to the globular clusters by subdwarf main - sequence fitting on the bais of hipparcos parallaxes , giving @xmath0=0.15 at [ fe / h]=2.1 .",
    "these bright values of @xmath0 imply much younger age for the oldest globular clusters than the previous estimates ( bolte & hogan 1995 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "however , the direct estimates of @xmath0 in the present study support much fainter value than the indirect estimates obtained by them .",
    "the present results give @xmath85 at [ fe / h]=1.9 , given the slope 0.20 of the @xmath0-[fe / h ] relation .",
    "note that the walker s @xmath0 combined with the lmc distance modulus of 18.37 ( gould 1995 ) derived from the sn 1987a ring distance yields @xmath0=0.57 at [ fe / h]=1.9 , which favors the present results .",
    "our findings imply that the age of the oldest globular clusters in our galaxy still conflicts with the standard cosmological model of a flat , matter - dominated universe with the hubble constant @xmath14km@xmath15s@xmath16mpc@xmath17 estimated from almost all observations ( bolt & hogan 1995 ) .",
    "it appears that the age problem remains still unresolved .",
