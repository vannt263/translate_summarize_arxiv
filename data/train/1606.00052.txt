    "the three most fundamental parameters of a star are its mass , its composition , and its angular momentum .",
    "together , they determine how the star evolves from birth through the pre - main sequence phase to main sequence hydrogen burning , and beyond , and further , whether and how planets form and migrate .",
    "angular momentum evolution is tied during star formation to cloud core fragmentation processes and stellar multiplicity , and during pre - main sequence evolution to star - disk interactions coupled with simple radial contraction and internal structural changes .",
    "main sequence angular momentum evolution is dominated by spin - down due to mass loss and core - envelope coupling efficiencies .",
    "although theoretical guidance addressing these matters for stars from myr to gyr ages has been significant ( see,_e.g .",
    "_ , bouvier et  al .",

    ", we need a thorough understanding of the rotational distribution of stars in the pleiades .",
    "there is ample evidence that angular momentum evolution depends on stellar mass , so obtaining a reliable rotation distribution for stars of a wide range of masses is critically important .",
    "the nasa k2 mission ( howell et  al .  2014 ) , using the repurposed 1-m kepler spacecraft , observed the pleiades cluster nearly continuously for 72 days , enabling us to probe rotation rates to lower masses and to higher precision than ever before .",
    "the pleiades has been extensively studied for decades ( _ e.g. _ , trumpler 1921 , hertzsprung 1947 , johnson & mitchell 1958 ) , and more recent surveys ( _ e.g. _ , lodieu et  al .",

    "none of these latter confusing lcs were found to be periodic .    in two cases , there are pairs of lightcurves that are indistinguishable .",

    "different lc versions can make more of a difference in the derived period than different period - finding algorithms because of the influence of artifacts .",

    "the power spectra indicate unambiguously periodic signals ",
    "the peak is so high that little structure other than the peak can be seen in the power spectrum , and when there is substructure , it is a harmonic of the main signal .",
    "( however , see paper ii for multi - periodic stars . ) for signals like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlefreq ] , the false alarm probability ( fap ) returned by the ls algorithm is 0 ; for @xmath197% of the sample with periods , the fap of the main peak is very small , @xmath10 . for many stars ,",
    "the fap of the second or third peak is _ also _",
    "@xmath10 , which gives rise to the multi - periodic discoveries in paper ii .",
    "the only situations in which we took a star to be periodic when the fap for the peak calculated over the whole lc was not @xmath10 were situations in which , _",
    "e.g. _ , half the lc was corrupted by instrumental effects and thus we took a @xmath2 derived from the unaffected portion ( which then meant that the fap computed for that peak on that portion of the lc was very low ) , or the three stars in sec .",
    "[ sec : litp ] where there is a clear peak at the same location as others found for this star in an independent dataset , even if the formal fap calculated for that peak from the k2 data was high .    for stars of the mass range considered here , the periods that we measure are , by and large , star spot - modulated rotation periods .",
    "spot modulation is the simplest explanation for sinusoidal ( or sinusoidal - like ) variations where there are changes over an entire rotation phase .",
    "to be conservative , we required at least 2 complete cycles of a pattern to call it periodic , thus the maximum period we searched for was 35 d. we do not expect pleiades members to be rotating more slowly than 35d .",
    "indeed , the distribution of periods we found ( see figure  [ fig : phisto ] ) is strongly peaked at @xmath181 day ; only @xmath13% of the periods over all 1020 lcs ( not just members identified in sec .",
    "[ sec : membership ] below ) are longer than 10 d. because the number of rotation periods falls off so strongly , we suspect that few or no legitimate rotation periods of pleiades members are @xmath035d , and our approach is not unduly biasing our derived distribution of rotation periods in the pleiades",
    ". there may be some patterns that are repeated on timescales longer than 35d , but they are not rotation periods ",
    "the shapes of the lcs are much different than the rotation periods in the data .",
    "additionally , by inspection of individual lcs , we deemed some periodic signals with periods shorter than 35 d to not necessarily be rotation periods .",
    "two objects , epic 211082420 ( hii1431 ) and 210822691 ( akii465 ) are eclipsing binaries ( see david et  al .  2015 , 2016 ) . we have removed these periods from our sample because they are not spot - modulated rotation periods ( akii465 is also likely not a member of the pleiades ) .",
    "there are other eclipsing binaries in our data , but for those , there is also a periodic signal from the primary , which we retain here because it is likely to be a rotation rate ; see , for example , 211093684/hii2407 in david et  al .",
    "there are 28 additional objects that have features in their ls periodograms that suggest possible periods @xmath1935 d , but that which we believe are not unambiguously periodic . those stars are listed appendix  [ app : timescales ] for reference and those periods have been removed from subsequent analysis .",

    "[ fig : optcmd ] , about 8% of the sample are not detected as periodic in our data ( see appendix  [ app : ndap ] for example lcs and power spectra ) .",
    "for these stars , one or more of these criteria are met : ( a ) no periodogram peaks with very low fap in the ls output ; ( b ) periodogram peak(s ) change position significantly between lc versions , or the purported periodic signal appears as a peak in the periodograms in only one lc version ; ( c ) phased lc does not look convincing ( _ e.g. _ , a wide distribution of fluxes at most phases ) because the pattern is not well - repeated from cycle to cycle ; ( d ) lc obviously and signficantly affected by instrumental effects ( _ e.g. _ , bimodal distribution of flux values originating from saturated pixels ) ; ( e ) rarely , the repeated pattern is not consistent with spot modulation .",
    "a list of those in the last category appear in appendix  [ app : timescales ] .",
    "some of these not - detected - as - periodic members can be found at nearly every color .",
    "the k2 data are exquisite , and we expect all stars to rotate , and low - mass stars as young as the pleiades should have large starspots .",
    "there are several possible explanations as to why we do not detect these stars to be periodic .",
    "these stars could have periods much longer than 35d , which is very unlikely for the pleiades . despite our best efforts , these stars could actually be non - members ( and thus could have a period much longer than 35 d ; with only 72 d of data , it would be hard to reliably identify a period much longer than 35 d )",
    ". it could be that these stars have periodic variations on timescales @xmath1835 d but at a lower level than we can detect , perhaps from smaller spots / spot groups .",
    "the stars could have a rotation axis that is pole - on , such that there really is little to no variation detectable from our solar system .",
    "alternatively , they could have disorganized spots distributed more or less homogeneously that preclude a reliably periodic signal in the lc . in about half of the cases , however , these lcs are corrupted by instrumental effects in the data reductions we have ; either the stars are too bright themselves for reliable lcs , or nearby bright stars adversely affect the extracted lcs .",
    "there are also several lcs that are just effectively too faint ( poor signal - to - noise ratio , snr ) for viable periods to be extracted from the data reductions we have .",
    "a period might have been detected for many of these not detected as periodic member stars if the saturation level was higher , or the exposures different ( longer for the poor snr , shorter for the saturated ) , or if the star was located elsewhere on the ccd . since we already detect periods in a very large fraction of the members ,",
    "were it not for these non - astrophysical effects , the fraction could be even closer to 1 .",
    "this is different than prior studies of rotation in clusters , and it means that we have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the pleiades .    basic parameters for these stars not detected as periodic are listed in table  [ tab : bigaperiodic ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : pvmk ] shows the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3  for the sample .",

    "there is a region in which there seems to be a disorganized relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3  between @xmath47@xmath3@xmath48 ( 0.2@xmath46 15 d ) .",
    "another important thing to note is that the lower - confidence members still follow the overall trends here ; there is no compelling evidence from this plot per se to move those lower - confidence members into the non - member set .",
    "( in contrast , see appendix  [ app : nm ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pvmknm ] below . )    among the long - period outliers in this plot , there are five stars with periods longer than 12 days , one of which is a lower - confidence member , but four of which are high confidence members .",
    "those long-@xmath2 outliers are curious , since they seem out of place relative to the other members .",
    "these stars are discussed further in paper iii , though we highlight one here .",
    "we have taken epic 210855272/dh668 to have a period of 17.6 d for the reasons discussed in paper ii ; that seems to be the best period .",
    "however , if we take @xmath2=8.9 d ( the other peak that appears in the periodogram ) , then this star would no longer be a long - period outlier ; for its @xmath3 , it would have a @xmath2 more consistent with other stars of its color .",
    "it has h@xmath39 in absorption , but this may be acceptable for @xmath3=3.6 mag . at that color , it has the largest h@xmath39 absorption equivalent width in the pleiades , comparable to a field star at that color .",
    "it has a 60% chance of being a member according to deacon & hambly ( 2004 ) , and a 72% chance of being a member in bouy et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) ; based on that , we have it as a lower - confidence member .    among the blue short - period outliers ,",
    "the stars we identify as pulsators in paper ii have demonstrably shorter periods on average ( and are among the bluest stars ) than the rest of the ensemble , and this matches expectations .",
    "there are other very blue stars that are not quite among the shortest periods .",
    "their lc morphology are more suggestive of rotation than pulsation",
    ". the stars with @xmath490.3 d could also be pulsators ( see paper ii ) .",
    "normal a and f stars should not have spots , though am stars could have spots ( _ e.g. _ , balona et  al.2015 ) .",
    "they could also be unresolved binaries , where the @xmath3corresponds to the primary , but the @xmath2 corresponds to the fainter , lower - mass , spotted secondary .      whether a star is single or is one component of a binary could affect the measured rotation period we detect in the k2 pleiades data .",
    "this might be true because the formation mechanism for single and binary stars might have different dependencies on either the initial angular momentum of the collapsing cloud core or on how much of that angular momentum is retained in the zams descendents of that process .",
    "in addition , being a member of a binary will affect the photometric colors we measure and the signal - to - noise properties of any periodic signature that we measure in the k2 data .",
    "we therefore have searched for the possible influence of binarity on the period distribution that we have measured .",
    "the discussion about the influence of binarity continues in papers ii and iii .",
    "we assembled binary information from the literature ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : membership ] ) from spectroscopy , radial velocities , high spatial resolution imaging , and new robo - ao data ( riddle et  al .  in prep ) .",
    "the advantage of this inhomogenous data set is that we have a chance of identifying all of the binaries , but the disadvantage is that many existing surveys were limited spatially or limited by stellar brightness such that lack of binarity from this collection of data may actually reflect a lack of information rather than anything else .",
    "figure  [ fig : optcmdbinary ] shows where these literature binaries fall in the cmd ; figure  [ fig : pvmk5binary ] shows @xmath2 vs.  @xmath3  with the literature binaries highlighted . in these figures , visual binaries , spectroscopic binaries , binaries from adaptive optics ( ao ) observations , and eclipsing",
    "binaries are indicated separately .",
    "it is clear that most of the literature methods focused on bluer ( brighter ) stars . about 10% of the sample",
    "is tagged binary in the literature .",
    "we can also use the optical cmd assembled here ( fig .",
    "[ fig : optcmd ] ) to more uniformly identify photometric binaries by the stars location in the cmd ( see paper iii for details of this process ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we can identify binaries with uniform sensitivity through the whole viable range of our data .",
    "the disadvantage is that we will miss binaries whose masses are significantly different from each other ( i.e. , causing only small shifts in the cmd ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : optcmdbinary ] shows the cmd , and figure  [ fig : pvmk5binary ] shows @xmath2 vs.  @xmath3 , for photometric binaries selected via this approach ; about 16% of the sample is tagged binary .",
    "the slow sequence has relatively few binaries identified , except for the spectroscopic binaries , and these are nearly all cases where no secondary has been directly detected . in these cases , the secondary is generally much fainter than the primary , and the secondary is therefore unlikely to be significantly affecting the k2 light curves . even in the cases of the visual binaries in the slow sequence , many of the secondaries are much fainter than their primaries , and here too ,",
    "the secondaries are unlikely to have much of an impact on the k2 light curves of these stars . since the primary stars are in the ` right place ' in the @xmath2 vs.  @xmath3  diagram for stars of their @xmath3  ( mass )",
    ", we infer that there is little influence on the primary s rotation rate by the much lower mass secondary for these binaries .",
    "we continue the discussion about the influence of binarity in papers ii and iii .",
    "we calculated the amplitude of the light curves in magnitudes by assembling the distribution of all points in the light curve , taking the log of the 90th percentile flux , subtracting from that the log of the 10th percentile flux , and multiplying by 2.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampldistrib ] plots that amplitude against both @xmath2 and @xmath3  for the periodic light curves .",
    "while the lower amplitude variations are found at all periods , they tend to cluster at bluer colors ; stars bluer than about @xmath3@xmath11.1 ( see paper iii ) have distinctly lower amplitudes .",
    "some of these stars are likely pulsators , which accounts for the lower amplitude .",
    "some are probably unresolved binaries , where the amplitude of the flux variation from the companion ( causing the periodicity ) is lessened by the flux from the primary .",
    "the median of the amplitude distribution ( with or without the @xmath3@xmath181.1 stars ) is 0.030 mag .",
    "the outlier with the very large amplitude is 211010517/ugcsj040234.77 + 230828.4 and it has a large amplitude because of a large - scale trend that is superimposed on the periodic light curve .",
    "we have taken it to be one of the best ( high - quality ) members , but it is just barely in the expected location in the cmd to be placed in the best member subset .    aside from the outliers at the small and large amplitude ends of the distribution , there does not seem to be a trend with color or period .",
    "we have presented the first part of our analysis of the k2 pleiades lightcurves , in the process vastly expanding the number of pleiades members known with periods , particularly at the low mass end . about 92% of the observed pleiades members have at least one measured period , the overwhelming majority of which we believe to be spot - modulated rotation periods . for the @xmath18% of the members without periods ,",
    "non - astrophysical effects often dominate ( saturation , etc . ) , such that periodic signals might have been detectable , all other things being equal .",
    "we now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the pleiades .",
    "the overall relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3   follows the overall trends found in other pleiades studies .",
    "there is a slowly rotating sequence for @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5 ( 2@xmath4611 d ) , and a primarily rapidly rotating population for @xmath3@xmath6 ( 0.1 @xmath46 2 d ) .",
    "there is a region in which there seems to be a disorganized relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3  between @xmath47@xmath3@xmath8 ( 0.2@xmath46 15 d ) .",
    "thanks in no small part to the many low - mass fast rotators , the distribution of periods peaks strongly at @xmath181 day ; only @xmath13% of the periods are longer than 10 d. the typical amplitude of the variation ( between 10 - 90% of the distribution of points ) is @xmath10.03 mag .",
    "some much lower amplitudes can be found at the bluest colors , which could be from pulsation or a consequence of binarity ( where the lower - mass , fainter star is responsible for the spot - modulated rotation period ) .",
    "our periods agree well with the literature periods and literature @xmath21 .",
    "there is no simple way to distinguish binaries from single stars in the @xmath2 vs.  @xmath3  parameter space .",
