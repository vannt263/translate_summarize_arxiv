    "how the measurable traits of organisms , their phenotypes , emerge from the instructions encoded in genomes , counts amongst the most challenging and essential questions to understand organismal evolution and adaptation . at present",
    ", the genotype - phenotype relationship can not be experimentally evaluated in an exhaustive fashion , since research is mostly limited to analyse the effect that specific mutations have in the fitness of organisms .",
    "therefore , most of our knowledge has been derived from simple models that investigate one - level maps , as rna sequences and their folded states , or ensembles of chemical reactions and the molecules they can metabolize .",
    "given our current limitations , it is essential to work with models that are as realistic as possible , but keep computational tractability .",
    "here we introduce ty , a multi - level model that maps genotypes ( formed by a variable number of genes and a polymerase protein ) into phenotypes .",
    "once interactions between proteins in the model and environmental metabolites are defined , phenotypes correspond to those ensembles of genes able to undertake metabolite catalysis . other natural properties such as regulatory networks or proteins with multiple functions naturally emerge in ty , which appears as a powerful tool to explore aspects of the genotype - phenotype map that as yet can not be experimentally addressed .",
    "describing and understanding the intricacies of the genotype - phenotype map counts amongst the most difficult and most essential issues to comprehend organismal complexity and adaptation through natural selection @xcite .",
    "high - throughput data obtained from whole genome sequencing and other -omics techniques currently allow a characterization with unprecedented detail of how genotypic variation affects phenotypes .",
    "the analysis of gene networks has demonstrated that phenotypes can not be understood on the basis of isolated genes @xcite , and that the effects of mutations strongly depend on a genetic background that expresses at different levels before generating a final phenotype @xcite .",
    "while simple point mutations may affect more than one gene @xcite , phenotypes , overall , tend to be extremely robust : populations may sustain a high level of criptic variation that acts at once as a buffering mechanism @xcite and as a reservoir of variability to promote rapid adaptation @xcite .",
    "an essential part of our improved understanding of the concepts , design principles and general mechanisms underlying the appearance of biological function from organismal genomes arises from the use of _ in silico _ tools and models @xcite .",
    "the neutral theory of evolution @xcite posits that most mutations have no , or very little , effect on phenotypes , and are thus ignored by natural selection .",
    "this is an amply supported fact , though the level at which mutations cease to have an effect is a matter of research .",
    "dna is translated into proteins and ribozymes which fold into three - dimensional structures .",
    "these molecules bind to each other and to the genome itself , enhancing or inhibiting the expression of genes hence forming highly complex regulatory networks , and eventually interact with metabolites to produce the metabolic pathways that sustain cellular life @xcite .",
    "redundancy appears at all these levels . besides the well - known redundancy of the genetic code ,",
    "many different aminoacid @xcite in the case of proteins or rna @xcite in the case of ribozymes sequences fold into equivalent three - dimensional structures and exhibit similar interaction sites , thus maintaining their functions .",
    "regulatory and metabolic networks are quite robust to additions , eliminations or substitutions of some of their components as well . for instance , regulatory regions with similar transcriptional output often have little overt sequence similarity , both within and between genomes @xcite .",
    "also , regulatory dna sequences in different _ drosophila _ species exhibiting the same expression patterns are not conserved @xcite . as of robustness of metabolic networks , one - gene knockout experiments with _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ show that around 50% of mutants show a selective disadvantage below 1% relative to the wildtype @xcite .",
    "similar results have been obtained with _",
    "escherichia coli _ @xcite .",
    "the huge number of genomic solutions ushering in the same phenotype leads to the concept of genotype networks , that is ensembles of genotypes that yield the same phenotype and can be mutually accessed through mutations @xcite .",
    "genotype networks often traverse the whole space of genotypes , and are highly interwoven : virtually any phenotype is just a few mutations away from any other .",
    "these networks reflect the robustness of phenotypes against mutations , and their structure is essential to promote adaptability and evolutionary innovation @xcite .",
    "most of our knowledge on the topology of genotype networks relies on information obtained from well - motivated computational models that map genotype onto a simplified phenotype .",
    "classical examples mapping sequence to molecular structure ( which acts as a proxy for phenotype ) are those of rna @xcite or proteins folded through algorithms of variable complexity @xcite .",
    "other models have addressed the map between higher expression levels , as those mimicking gene regulatory networks @xcite or metabolism @xcite .    despite the significant conceptual advances provided by those models ,",
    "there are two crucial elements of the genotype - phenotype map that they disregard : the existence of a hierarchy of expression levels between genotype and phenotype and the bi - directional coupling among the levels .",
    "studies focusing on rna or proteins assume that the molecular function is mostly determined by their spatial structure .",
    "this makes sense for some very specific enzymes @xcite but , in general , these molecules are pieces of complex regulatory or metabolic networks .",
    "further , molecular interactions are not considered ( see @xcite for an exception modelling the quaternary structure of proteins ) , and there is no representation of the molecular context @xcite .",
    "therefore , cases where a protein may act as an enhancer of the expression of a gene by sticking to its promoter , but may become sequestered and thus inactivated in the presence of another protein are impossible to embody in one - molecule models , among many others .    in turn",
    ", models considering higher levels typically disregard the dynamics of underlying sequences .",
    "gene regulatory networks are represented in an effective way through direct interactions among their components , as in boolean regulatory networks . in this case ,",
    "gene states are binary variables which interact ( enhancing or inhibiting the expression of interacting genes ) to determine new states at a subsequent time step @xcite .",
    "boolean networks do not consider how mutations at the genome level propagate to upper levels , and only implement straight changes in the boolean functions .",
    "the situation is similar with metabolic models that use the ensemble of metabolic reactions as genotypes , since the kind of mutations considered can thus only be the elimination or addition of reactives or full reactions @xcite .",
    "the current situation is that we lack a model that captures the essentials of the biology at all levels from genome to metabolisms , but which at the same time is sufficiently simple so as to provide useful answers and insights about the genotype - phenotype mapping . in this paper",
    "we make one such proposal , that we refer to as ty .",
    "ty is a model that contains simplified versions of genes , promoters , proteins , and metabolites , which interact with each other under the laws of a simplified chemistry . besides introducing the model and showing examples of its rich phenomenology",
    ", we identify a number of emerging properties that ty shares with natural systems .",
    "such are the existence of a large number of robust phenotypes , of common metabolic functions ( which arise in the absence of any evolutionary fine - tuning ) , a space - covering map at the sequence - structure level ( as observed in rna and protein folding models ) but a small fraction of metabolically functional genomes .",
    "coupling among different levels restricts the diversity of possible boolean functions , as well as the metabolites that can be broken . in the framework of ty",
    ", mutations can show their effects at different levels before affecting the phenotype , and functional molecules can be co - opted to fulfill different and not previously foreseen functions .",
    "the basic building blocks of ty are toynucleotides ( toyn ) , toyaminoacids ( toya ) , and toysugars ( toys ) .",
    "each block comes in two flavors : hydrophobic ( h ) or polar ( p ) .",
    "random polymers of basic blocks constitute toygenes ( formed by 20 toyn units ) , toyproteins ( chains of 16 toya units ) , and toymetabolites ( sequences of toys units of arbitrary length ) .",
    "these elements of ty are defined on the two - dimensional space ( figure [ fig : elements ] ) .",
    "toygenes are composed of a 4-toyn promoter region followed by a 16-toyn coding region .",
    "there are @xmath0 different promoters and @xmath1 coding regions , leading to @xmath2 toygenes .",
    "an ensemble of toygenes forms a genotype .",
    "if the toygene is expressed , it will produce a chain of 16 toya that represents a protein .",
    "translation follows a straightforward rule : h ( p ) toyn translate into h ( p ) toya .",
    "toyproteins correspond to the minimum energy , maximally compact folded structure of the 16 toya chain arising from a translated gene .",
    "their folded configuration is calculated through the hydrophobic - polar ( hp ) protein lattice model @xcite ( see methods and figure [ fig : folding ] ) .",
    "two toyproteins can bind to each other to form a toydimer , which is the only protein aggregate considered in ty .",
    "the toypolymerase is a special kind of molecule characterized by a specific sequence of 4 toya and an otherwise indetermined structure .",
    "it is always present in the system . in the ty universe ,",
    "only the folding energy and perimeter of a toyprotein matter to characterize its interactions , so folded chains sharing these two features are indistinguishable .",
    "this is a difference with respect to the original hp model , where different inner cores defined different proteins and the composition of the perimeter was not considered as a phenotypic feature .",
    "however , subsequent versions of hp had already included additional traits @xcite .",
    "expression of toygenes occurs through the interaction with the toypolymerase , which can bind to promoters but also to other toyproteins ( including toydimers , see methods and figure [ fig : elements]*a * ) .",
    "when the toypolymerase binds to a promoter , translation is directly activated and the corresponding toygene is expressed .",
    "however , a more stable ( lower energy ) binding of a toyprotein or toydimer to a promoter precludes the binding of the toypolymerase .",
    "this inhibits the expresion of the toygene , except if the toypolymerase binds to a specific site of the toyprotein / toydimer , in which case the toygene can be expressed ( figure [ fig : regulation ] ) .",
    "following the rules of the hp model , h - p and h - h interactions are also used for inter - molecular interactions , and thus to quantify the energy of the bound states toyprotein - toygene , toyprotein - toyprotein , and toyprotein - toymetabolite ( see methods and figure [ fig : elements ] ) .",
    "both the version of the hp model we use and the inter - molecular interactions considered depend on parameters that stand for the decrease in free energy when h - p and h - h bonds are formed : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( with @xmath5 ) , as in @xcite .",
    "the interaction and dynamical rules in ty have been chosen so as to make the model as simple as possible , while retaining the essentials of molecular genetics . following the original hp model ( which disregards lattice proteins with multiple minimal energy folds ) , interactions between ty elements",
    "are univocally defined according to specific disambiguation rules ( see methods ) .",
    "the dynamics of the model proceeds in discrete time steps and variable molecular concentrations are not taken into account .",
    "a step - by - step description of ty dynamics is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : iteration ] .",
    "there is an initial set of molecules which results from the previous time step : toyproteins ( including toydimers and the toypolymerase ) and toymetabolites , either endogenous or provided by the environment .",
    "these molecules first interact between them to form possible complexes ( see methods ) and are then presented to a collection of toygenes that is kept constant along subsequent iterations .",
    "regulation takes place , mediated by a competition for binding the promoters of toygenes , possibly causing their activation and leading to the formation of new proteins .",
    "toyproteins / toydimers not bound to any toymetabolite disappear in this phase .",
    "thus , only the newly expressed toyproteins and the complexes involving toymetabolites in the input set remain .",
    "all these molecules interact yet again ( see methods ) , and here is where catalysis can occur ( see below ) .",
    "free toyproteins / toydimers will form part of the input set for the next time step . however , toyproteins / toydimers bound to toymetabolites disappear in this phase , and only the toymetabolites are kept as input to the next time step .",
    "unbound toymetabolites are returned to the environment .         are toyproteins ( ps ) ( including toydimers ( ds ) ) and toymetabolites , either produced as output at time step @xmath6 or environmentally supplied ( all toymetabolites denoted ms ) .",
    "ps and ds interact with ms to produce complexes p - m and d - m .",
    "next , these complexes , the remaining ps and ds , and the toypolymerase ( pol ) interact with toygenes ( g ) at the regulation phase . the most stable complexes with promoters are formed ( pol - g , p - g and d - g ) , activating or inhibiting toygenes .",
    "p - ms and d - ms do not participate in regulation .",
    "ps and ds not in complexes are eliminated and new ps ( dark grey ) are formed .",
    "these ps interact with all molecules present and form ds , new p - m and d - m complexes , and catalize old d - m complexes . at the end of this phase ,",
    "all ms not bound to ps or ds disappear , and all ps and ds in p - m and d - m complexes unbind and also disappear .",
    "the remaining molecules ( ms just released from complexes , as well as all free ps and ds ) go to the input set of time step @xmath7.,width=566 ]      the minimal interaction rules that define ty dynamics endow toyproteins with a set of possible activities not included _ a priori _ in the rules of the model ( see figure [ fig : regulation ] ) .",
    "for example , since the 4-toyn interacting site of the toypolymerase can not bind to all promoter regions , translation mediated by a toyprotein or toydimer binding might allow the expression of genes that would otherwise never be translated .",
    "these toyproteins thus act as activators .",
    "this process finds a counterpart in toyproteins that bind to promoter regions more stably than the toypolymerase does , and therefore prevent gene expression .",
    "they are acting as inhibitors .",
    "there are two additional functions that could not be foreseen and involve a larger number of molecules .",
    "a toyprotein that forms a toydimer with an inhibitor preventing its binding to the promoter effectively behaves as an activator for the expression of the toygene . however , it interacts neither with the promoter region nor with the toypolymerase , and its activating function only shows up when the inhibitor is present .",
    "this kind of toyproteins thus act as conditional activators . on the other hand",
    ", two toyproteins can bind together to form a toydimer that inhibits the expression of a particular toygene . as the presence of both toyproteins",
    "is needed to perform this function , they behave as conditional inhibitors .",
    "this flexible , context - dependent behavior of toyproteins , permits the construction of toy gene regulatory networks ( toygrn ) .",
    "molecular interactions and dynamical rules in ty can be translated into toygrn that behave as deterministic boolean networks @xcite .",
    "the corresponding boolean variables are the states ( expressed or not expressed ) of toygenes .",
    "these variables are transformed through boolean functions that represent the dynamical rules described , having as input current toygene states and as output their states at the next time step .",
    "boolean functions depend on the toyproteins present in the system and on the functions they perform . through iteration of the boolean map one can characterize the set of attractors of the dynamics and the corresponding basins of attraction .",
    "if the initial set is formed by @xmath8 genes , we should consider @xmath9 different possible vectors of dimension @xmath8 that correspond to the initial states ( i.e. all combinations of genes being expressed ( 1 ) or not expressed ( 0 ) ) .",
    "first , the presence of possible toydimers coming from expressed genes is evaluated , and then their interactions with promoter regions ( in competition or cooperation with the toypolymerase and other toyproteins ) are evaluated .",
    "this yields an updated set of expressed toygenes ( a different state ) to which the previous rules are again applied . in this way",
    ", one can construct a truth table that can be subsequently represented in the form of a directed graph ( indicating which state maps into which other ) and is fully analogous to a deterministic boolean network .",

    "signs ) , and toyprotein 1 inhibits the expression of toygene 2 ( @xmath10 signs ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of toyproteins 1 and 3 leads to toydimer 1 - 3 , and the simultaneous presence of toyproteins 1 and 2 to toydimer 1 - 2 .",
    "both toydimers inhibit the expression of toygene 2 and activate the expression of toygene 3 .",
    "the construction of the boolean functions codified in the truth table is straightforward given the interactions conditional on presence or absence of each toyprotein ( expression or non - expression of each gene ) .",
    "when the truth table is represented as a directed graph ( summarizing the dynamics of the system from all possible initial conditions ) it is seen that there are two attractors for the dynamics : @xmath11 , whose basin of attraction has size 7 , and @xmath12 , whose basin of attraction has size 1 .",
    "( note that the order of toygenes in a genome is irrelevant , and only responds to aesthetic reasons.),width=566 ]      the presence of toymetabolites may modify toygrn by changing the output states of the corresponding boolean network ( figure fig : truthmet ) . according to the dynamical rules of ty",
    ", toymetabolites may interact with toyproteins or toydimers .",
    "any molecule bound to a toymetabolite is no longer available to bind to promoters , and therefore the expression of the toygrn is modified .",
    "toymetabolites that do not bind to any toyprotein or toydimer will not be in the input set for the next time step .",
    "on the other hand , bound toymetabolites will , unless catalysis occurs .",
    "catalysis happens when , once a bound state toymetabolite - toydimer is formed , an additional toyprotein binds to one of the units of the toydimer with an energy lower than that of the initial toydimer . in this case , the latter disassembles in favor of the new toydimer , and in the process the toymetabolite is broken ( see figure fig : metabolism for an illustration of the catalysis process ) .",
    "the two pieces of the toymetabolite will contribute to the input set at the next time step .",
    "an example of how a toygrn might change can be derived from figure [ fig : truth ] : if a toymetabolite able to bind to toydimer 1 - 3 is added to the input set , state @xmath11 is mapped to @xmath13 ( figure fig : truthmet ) .",
    "the behavior just described prompts the identification of metabolically functional genotypes that we term metabolons .",
    "a metabolon in ty is an ensemble of toygenes able to catalyze at least one toymetabolite . in the example above , the three toygenes are a basic metabolon that catalyzes in particular the toymetabolite used as example .",
    "when the toymetabolite is absent , the dynamics is described in figure [ fig : truth ] and eventually converges to the steady state @xmath11",
    "except if the initial state is @xmath12 .",
    "this state is however disturbed under a constant supply of toymetabolites able to bind to toydimer 1 - 3 . in that case , toygenes 1 and 2 are expressed in the next time step .",
    "toyprotein 1 is able to form a toydimer with itself , binding to unit 1 of the toydimer - toymetabolite complex .",
    "this latter interaction ( which forms toydimer 1 - 1 ) is favored over toydimer 1 - 3 and catalysis of the toymetabolite occurs(see figures fig : truthmet and fig : metabolism ) .",
    "if at the next time step the two pieces of toymetabolite are unable to interact with any of the toyproteins in the system , they are eliminated .",
    "the toygrn of this example remains in the new steady state @xmath13 which is also able to catalyze as long as toymetabolites are supplied .",
    "the three toygenes system returns to the former steady state @xmath11 as soon as the external supply stops .",
    "a graphical summary of a metabolon in ty is provided in figure fig : operon .",
    "ty integrates several levels of complexity : genotypes ( sequences of toygenes ) expressing toyproteins ( first level ) that interact among themselves and with promoters generating toygrns ( second level ) , and interactions with the environment ( third level ) trough catalysis of toymetabolites .",
    "genotypes are easily identified as the sequences of hs and ps making up toygenes . in ty , the visible expression of the genotype",
    "is best represented through its interaction with the environment , that is with toymetabolites .",
    "accordingly , the phenotype of a genotype ( a collection of toygenes ) is defined as the ensemble of toymetabolites it can catalyze",
    ". there are @xmath14 different toymetabolites of size 8 , and a genotype can either catalyze ( in which case it is a metabolon ) or not each of them .",
    "the phenotype is formally defined as a vector of dimension @xmath15 whose components take value 1 at those positions corresponding to toymetabolites that can be catalyzed , and value 0 otherwise .",
    "this definition is analogous to others in the literature where metabolic activity is explicitely modelled @xcite .",
    "as it has been defined , there are no mutations of toygenes explicitly considered in the dynamics of ty .",
    "the initial sequences of toygenes remain constant as we study properties of the emerging toygrn and related phenotypes .",
    "this nonetheless , those conditions do not prevent an analysis of the effect of mutations in the phenotype . actually , an interesting product of the multi - level structure of ty is the possibility of determining at which level is the effect of point mutations observed .",
    "point mutations are changes from a p toyn to an h toyn , or _",
    "vice versa _ , in the sequence of a toygene .    a summary of changes caused by point mutations in the metabolon in fig .",
    "[ fig : truth ] can be found in table  1 . those effects are not exclusive , that is , a mutation causing a change in the perimeter of a toyprotein can leave other functions unchanged , or modify boolean functions in different ways which might eventually cause or not a phenotypic change . out of the @xmath16 possible mutations ( @xmath17 affecting the promoters and @xmath18 affecting the coding regions ) , @xmath19 are neutral , @xmath20 are deleterious , and only @xmath21 are beneficial .",

    "computational studies of rna sequences folding into their minimal energy secondary structure have enlightened a large number of dynamical and structural properties with a clear empirical counterpart , such as punctuated equilibria at the molecular level @xcite or increases in robustness with phenotype size @xcite , a feature that is quantitatively shared by all genotype - phenotype maps studied to date @xcite .",
    "boolean networks , despite working with a sharp threshold for gene expression , have witnessed notable success , including faithful reproduction of living cell cycles @xcite .",

    "the possibilities of ty are not exhausted by the cases presented in this work , which constitute a minimal hopefully illustrative sample of the kind of complexity ty might encode for . in devising the model here analyzed , we had to make some choices regarding energy parameters , number of molecules or genes allowed to interact , or disambiguation rules to define functional molecules .",
    "preliminary analyses of equally reasonable alternatives indicate that ty universes defined through similar rules display a phenomenology comparable to the one here presented .",
    "still , a deeper exploration of certain emergent behaviors seems worth pursuing .",
    "first , ty gives clues on the level between genotype and phenotype where the effect of mutations can be seen .",
    "distance between phenotypes is simple to define in ty , and a more systematic analysis might allow as well a quantitative comparison with empirical studies measuring the distribution of fitness effects @xcite . this function is an important object in developing models of phenotypic change that effectively incorporate the molecular details of evolution .",
    "second , even the three - toygenes genomes here studied reveal the emergence of functional abilities not implemented in the basic rules of the model , such as toyproteins behaving as conditional activators .",
    "this observation indicates that a protein can be recruited in appropriate molecular contexts to perform additional functions , that is , it can be co - opted to develop a second useful , but non - adaptive , role @xcite .",
    "the consideration of larger genomes and larger molecular aggregates should certainly usher in new collective abilities , and very often lead to multi - functional toyproteins . in this scenario ,",
    "the effect of single mutations might then arise at multiple levels , likely revealing a pleiotropic structure @xcite in the ty genotype - phenotype map .",
    "the effect of point mutations at different levels and the fraction of neutral or lethal mutations , among others , would be relevant issues to explore .",
    "it will also be interesting to study how different metabolons are fit together in a larger genome , developing more complex metabolic networks than the ones shown in this paper .",
    "third , it would be worth comparing the statistical properties of random boolean networks and other gene regulatory networks with those obtained from ty .",
    "an open and challenging question is how an explicit consideration of genome dynamics modifies or constrains the statistical properties of genotype - phenotype models that discard them .",
    "fourth , for three - toygenes genomes , we have observed a very high dilution of metabolons in comparison to genomes that can not break any of the toymetabolites considered .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with models of gene regulatory networks @xcite and metabolism @xcite that ignore lower levels .",
    "an open question is how this dilution changes as we increase the number of participating toygenes and diversify the set of toymetabolites that should be catalysed . at present , this study is severely limited by the computational time it requires .",
    "finally , it is easy to implement additional mutational mechanisms in ty , such as gene duplication or deletion .",
    "the implications of such a change on the phenotype can not be foreseen without an explicit analysis .",
    "however , we have found two - toygenes metabolons whose function is maintained when a third toygene is added . in this respect , ty might provide complementary insight on the evolutionary effects of gene duplication , including their lethality and their ability to develop new functions @xcite .",
    "the design of models able to shed light on the complex structure of the genotype - phenotype map is actively pursued .",
    "research in the field has led to the identification of a number of generalities , as the broadly varying robustness of genotypes , the unequal distribution of phenotype sizes or the existence of genotype networks that permit the navigability of the space of genotypes and thus adaptation and evolutionary innovation while preserving function .",
    "however , some other issues still represent a challenge , as the effect of mutations in fitness or the precise mechanisms constraining evolution as a result of the bottom - up and top - down coupling among intermediate levels in the genotype - phenotype map .",
    "ty and possible variants thereof might provide a useful framework to explore these and related questions .",
    "the folding of toyproteins exactly follows the folding of hp random polymers first introduced in @xcite .",
    "we consider sequences of length 16 and limit the possible folds to compact @xmath51 structures on a lattice .",
    "there are 38 such structures ignoring symmetries .",
    "the energy of a fold is the sum of all pairwise interaction energies between toyaminoacids that are not contiguous along the sequence .",
    "pairwise interaction energies are @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as in @xcite .",
    "the structure of a toyprotein is its lowest energy fold .",
    "if there is more than one fold with the same minimum energy , we select the one with fewer h toyaminoacids in the perimeter .",
    "if still there is more than one fold fulfilling both conditions , we discard that protein by assuming that it is intrinsically disordered and thus non - functional @xcite . out of @xmath55 possible proteins , @xmath56 do not yield unique folds .",
    "we find @xmath57 different toyproteins with @xmath58 different perimeters .",
    "toyproteins interact through any of their sides with other toyproteins ( to form toydimers ) , with promoters of toygenes , and with toymetabolites . once formed , toydimers can also bind to promoters or toymetabolites through any of their sides ( binding to other toyproteins or toydimers is not permitted ) . in all cases ,",
    "the interaction energy ( @xmath59 ) is the sum of pairwise interactions for all hh , hp and pp pairs formed in the contact .",
    "bonds can be created only if the interaction energy between the two molecules @xmath59 is lower than a threshold energy @xmath60 .",
    "note that a minimum binding energy threshold is necessary to avoid the systematic interaction of any two molecules .",
    "other alternatives might be the addition of terms that represent an energetic cost or the consideration of stochastic interactions , such that those with higher energy would be less probable . if below threshold , the total energy of the resulting complex is the sum of @xmath59 plus the folding energy of all toyproteins involved .",
    "the lower the total energy , the more stable the complex .",
    "when several toyproteins or toydimers can bind to the same molecule , only the most stable complex is formed .",
    "consistently with the assumptions for protein folding , when this rule does not determine univocally the result , no binding is produced .",
    "toypolymerase is a special kind of toyprotein .",
    "it only has one interacting side ( with sequence hphp ) and its folding energy is fixed to value @xmath61 .",
    "toypolymerase binds to promoters or to the right side of a toyprotein / toydimer already bound to a promoter . in either case",
    "the toygene is expressed .",
    "as the length of toymetabolites is usually longer than 4 toyn ( the length of interacting toyproteins sites ) , there might be several positions where the interaction with a toyprotein has the same energy . in those cases",
    "we select the sites that yield the most centered interaction .",
    "if ambiguity persists , no bond is formed .",
    "also , no more than one toyprotein / toydimer is allowed to bind to the same toymetabolite , even if its length would permit it .",
    "toyproteins / toydimers bound to toymetabolites can not bind to promoters .",
    "binding to promoters is decided in sequence . starting with any of them ( the order is irrelevant )",
    ", it is checked whether any of the toyproteins / toydimers available bind to the promoter , and then whether toypolymerase can subsequently bind to the complex and express the accompanying coding region .",
    "if it does , the toygene is marked as active and the toyprotein / toydimer is released .",
    "then a second promoter is chosen and the process repeated , until all promoters have been evaluated .",
    "toygenes are only expressed after all of them have been marked as either active or inactive .",
    "each expressed toygene produces one single toyprotein molecule .",
    "there can be more units of the same toyprotein , but only if multiple copies of the same toygene are present .",
