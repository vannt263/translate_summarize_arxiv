    "in order to calculate physical observables from first principles in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite it is not enough to know its lagrangian .",

    "it is the response of the qcd vacuum which substantially modifies all the qcd green s functions from their free counterparts .",
    "these full ( `` dressed '' ) green s functions are needed for the above - mentioned calculations .",
    "the vacuum of qcd is a very complicated confining medium and its dynamical and topological complexity means that its structure can be organized at various levels : classical and quantum @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "it is mainly non - perturbative ( np ) by origin , character and magnitude , since the corresponding coupling constant is large .",
    "however , the virtual gluon field configurations and excitations of the perturbative ( pt ) origin , character and magnitude , due to asymptotic freedom ( af ) @xcite , are also present there .",
    "one of the main dynamical characteristics of the qcd ground state is the bag constant .",
    "its name comes from the famous bag models for hadrons @xcite , but its present understanding ( and thus modern definition ) not connecting to hadron properties .",
    "it is defined as the difference between the pt and the np vacuum energy densities ( veds ) @xcite .",
    "so , we can symbolically put @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the np but contaminated by the pt contributions ( i.e. , this is a full @xmath2 like the full gluon propagator , see below ) .",
    "at the same time , we can continue as follows : @xmath3 = ved^{pt } - [ ved^{tnp } + ved^{pt } ] = - ved^{tnp } > 0 $ ] , since the ved is always negative .",
    "the bag constant is nothing but the truly np ( tnp ) ved , apart from the sign , by definition , and thus is free of the pt contributions ( contaminations ) .",
    "the symbolic subtraction presented here includes the subtraction at the fundamental gluon level , and two others at the hadronic level , i.e. , when the gluon degrees of freedom should be integrated out ( see section [ sec : tnpved ] below ) . in order to consider it also as a physical characteristic of the qcd ground state ,",
    "the bag constant correctly calculated should satisfy some other necessary requirements such as colorlessness , finiteness , gauge - independence , no imaginary part ( stable vacuum ) , etc .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to formulate a formalism how to calculate correctly the quantum part of the bag constant , using the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite . in particular , to show how the above - mentioned subtractions are to be analytically made . on account of the confining effective charge ,",
    "the bag constant has been numerically evaluated , satisfying all the necessary requirements mentioned above .",
    "using further the trace anomaly relation @xcite , we also develop a general formalism which makes it possible to relate the bag constant to another important np characteristic of the qcd ground state - the gluon condensate @xcite . here , we do not use the weak coupling solution for the corresponding @xmath0 function .",
    "finally we present our numerical result for the bag constant , which is in a good agreement with other phenomenological estimates of the gluon condensate  @xcite .",

    "also it does not depend explicitly on the unphysical ( longitudinal ) part of the full gluon propagator due to the product @xmath27 , which , in its turn , comes from the above - mentioned normalization to zero .",
    "thus it is worth emphasizing that the transversal ( `` physical '' ) degrees of freedom only of gauge bosons contribute to this equation .",
    "note , in the effective potential approach to leading order there is no need for ghost degrees of freedom from the very beginning in order to cancel the longitudinal ( `` unphysical '' ) component of the full gluon propagator .",

( [ eq:5 ] ) and  ( [ eq:6 ] ) .    in the connection with the above - mentioned normalization condition a few remarks are in order .",
    "it does not work for the higher order vacuum loops .",
    "as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , for consistency with them in the pt qcd green s functions , for example in the hartree - fock approximation , the landau gauge should be used . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effective potential has been used to the two - loop order for the investigation of qcd chiral - symmetry breaking just in the landau gauge and in the hartree - fock approximatiion . in the general case ( i.e. , beyond the pt and at any gauge ) , however , the cancelation of unphysical gluon modes should proceed with the help of ghosts as it is described in more detail in appendix a.    the derived expression  ( [ eq:6 ] ) remains rather formal , since it suffers from the two serious problems : the coefficient of the transversal lorentz structure @xmath32 may still depend explicitly on @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , it is divergent at least as the fourth power of the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff , and therefore suffers from different types of the pt contributions .",
    "in order to define the ved free of the above - mentioned pt contributions ( contaminations ) , let us make first the subtraction at the fundamental gluon level , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 correctly describes the pt structure of the full effective charge @xmath32 , including its behavior in the uv limit ( af , @xcite ) , otherwise remaining arbitrary . on the other hand , @xmath35 defined by the above - made subtraction ,",
    "is assumed to reproduce correctly the tnp structure of the full effective charge , including its asymptotic in the deep infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "this underlines the strong intrinsic influence of the ir properties of the theory on its tnp dynamics . evidently , both terms are valid in the whole energy / momentum range , i.e , they are not asymptotics .",
    "let us also emphasize the principle difference between @xmath32 and @xmath35 .",
    "the former is the np quantity `` contaminated '' by the pt contributions , while the latter one being also np , nevertheless , is free of them .",
    "thus the formal separation between the tnp effective charge @xmath35 and its pt counterpart @xmath34 is achieved .",
    "for example , if the full effective charge explicitly depends on the scale responsible for the tnp dynamics in qcd , say @xmath36 - the so - called mass gap ( see section  [ sec : effq ] below ) , then one can define the subtraction as follows : @xmath37 , which is , obviously , equivalent to the decomposition  ( [ eq:7 ] ) . in this way the separation between the tnp effective charge and its pt counterpart becomes exact , but not unique",
    "let us emphasize that the dependence of the full effective charge @xmath38 on @xmath36 can be only regular .",
    "otherwise it is impossible to assign to it the above - mentioned physical meaning , since @xmath36 can be only zero ( the formal pt limit ) or finite , i.e. , it can not be infinitely large . in principle , in some special models of the qcd vacuum , such as the abelian higgs model  @xcite , the np scale is to be identified with the mass of the dual gauge boson .",
    "there is also another serious reason for the subtraction in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "the problem is that the above - mentioned uv asymptotic of the full effective charge may depend on the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath16 explicitly , namely to leading order @xmath39 , where the exponent @xmath40 explicitly depends on the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath16 via the coefficient @xmath41 based on ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath42 is the qcd asymptotic scale parameter . in this connection",
    "let us note that af being a physical phenomenon does not depend on the gauge choice ( it takes place at any gauge ) , while the uv asymptotic of the corresponding green s function may be still gauge - dependent .",
    "this is just explicitly shown above .",
    "evidently , in the decomposition  ( [ eq:7 ] ) just the pt part of the full effective charge will be responsible for this explicit dependence on the gauge choice .",
    "subtracting it , we will be guaranteed that the remaining part will not depend explicitly on the gauge - fixing parameter ( that is why the dependence on @xmath16 is not explicitly shown in @xmath35 ) .",
    "let us note that if there is no exact criterion how to distinguish between the tnp and the pt parts in the full effective charge in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) as described above , then it is possible from the full effective charge to subtract its uv asymptotic only .",
    "however , in this case the separation between the tnp and the pt parts will be neither exact nor unique .",

    "this confirms that our numerical values for the bag constant and hence for the gluon condensate are rather realistic ones .",
    "in summary , we have formulated a general method how to calculate numerically the quantum part of the tnp ym ved ( the ym bag constant , apart from the sign , by definition ) in the covariant gauge qcd from first principles . for this purpose",

    "( [ eq:18 ] ) , since it is exactly and uniquely separated from the pt effective charge . the inp effective charge depends regularly on the mass gap , which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd ground state  @xcite .",
    "the scale - setting schemes have been chosen by the two different ways , leading , nevertheless , to a rather close numerical results for the mass gap and hence for the effective scale .",
    "the calculated bag constant in addition , is : finite , positive , and it has no imaginary part ( stable vacuum ) .",

    "the separation of `` soft versus hard '' gluon momenta is also exact because of the maximization / minimization procedure .",

    "in addition , as mentioned above the integral  ( [ eq:11 ] ) , defining @xmath53 , may be still divergent .",

    "it suffers from various types of unphysical singularities which may appear in its right - hand - side . in order to get a physically meaningful expression",

    "this is to be done with the help of a ghost term by imposing the following condition of cancelation of unwanted terms in the most general form : @xmath157 .",

    "so the tnp gluon contribution to the ved has been determined by subtracting unwanted terms by means of the ghost contribution .",
    "evidently , the subtracted terms are of no importance , while a ghost term plays no explicit role for further consideration .    in qcd",
    "the general role of ghost degrees of freedom is to cancel all the unphysical degrees of freedom of gauge bosons  @xcite , maintaining thus unitarity of the @xmath5-matrix .",

    "this means that nothing should _ explicitly _ depend on them after the above - mentioned cancelation is performed .",
    "one of the main purposes of their introduction is to exclude the longitudinal ( unphysical ) component of the gluon propagator in every order of the pt , thus going beyond it and thus being a general one , indeed .",
    "if there is no need to cancel the longitudinal component of gauge boson propagators , then they should be used to eliminate the unphysical singularities of gauge bosons below the qcd asymptotic scale ( as it was described above ) , or some other ones which may be inevitably present in any solution / ansatz for the full gluon propagator .",
    "if one knows the ghost propagator exactly , then the above - mentioned cancelation of unphysical singularities of gauge bosons should proceed automatically , as usual in the pt calculus ( if , of course , all calculations are correct ) .",
    "for such an exact cancelation of the longitudinal part of the gluon propagator by the free pt ghost propagator in lower order of the pt see , for example ref .",

    "this just has been done above .",
    "thus our subtraction scheme is in agreement with the general interpretation of ghosts to cancel all the unphysical degrees of freedom of gauge bosons  @xcite .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that by no coincidence in all the papers cited above the transversal landau gauge has been chosen by hand from the very beginning .",

    "first of all , we need them in the higher orders of the two - particle irreducible vacuum graphs in the skeleton loop expansion of the effective potential @xcite , since for them the simple normalization of the free pt vacuum to zero does not work .",
    "so the cancelation of unphysical gluon modes should proceed with the help of the ghost degrees of freedom , as it was described in this appendix above .",

    "the whole machinery of all the st identities and the corresponding sd equations is still needed in order to insure the unitarity cancelations even in the landau gauge .",

    "( b.1 ) it follows that    @xmath181    where we used @xmath182 and @xmath183 denotes the above - mentioned plank length @xcite . in this units",
    "the observed ved is    @xmath184    so that the ratio between ( c.6 ) and ( c.7 ) becomes again ( c.5 ) , indeed .",
    "of course , the ratio ( c.5 ) still remains very large , but it is much better than the ratio ( c.4 ) , as emphasized above . other possibility how qcd can be related to the dark energy puzzle has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) .    concluding , the vacuum for which the value ( c.3 ) has been measured should not be mixed with the vacuum of any quantum field gauge theory . for the former one",
    "its energy is always positive ( i.e. , above zero ) , so the vacuum is simply treated as empty space .",
    "the energy of the latter one is always negative ( i.e. , below zero ) , and it is full of any kind of quantum excitations , fluctuations , etc .",
    "however , the qcd bag constant is always positive , finite , gauge - invariant , etc .",
    "( if it has been correctly defined and calculated like in this work ) . that is the primary reason why we can compare our value ( c.2 ) and the estimate ( c.1 ) with ( c.3 ) .",
    "the lamb shift and the casimir effect are probably the two most famous experimental evidences of zero - point energy fluctuations in the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "both effects are rather weak , since the qed vacuum is mainly pt by origin , character and magnitude ( the corresponding fine structure constant is weak ) .",
    "however , even in this case attempts have been already made to exploit the casimir effect in order to `` observe '' the negative energy and related affects @xcite and even to release energy from the vacuum ( see , for example refs . @xcite and references in the above - mentioned reviews @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite by investigating the thermodynamical properties of the quantum vacuum it has been concluded that no energy can be extracted cyclically from the vacuum ( see , however ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us also note that in qed the photon propagator always remains pt even `` dressed '' @xcite .",
    "so formally we can define the bag constant in this theory as @xmath185 , since @xmath186 in the effective potential approach to leading order @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to perform such a calculation , which will give one a correct finite value of the ved in qed , if , or course , the above proposed definition of the qed bag constant makes sense .",
    "but it is beyond the scope of the present investigation , and should be done elsewhere .    since the qcd fine structure constant is strong , the idea to exploit the qcd vacuum in order to extract energy from it seems to be more attractive .",
    "however , before discussing the ways how to extract , it is necessary to discuss which minimum / maximum amount of energy at all can be released in a single cycle . who thinks that it is too early to discuss such kind of topic ( though we do not think so )",
    "may entirely skip this appendix .",
    "the bag constant calculated here is a manifestly gauge - invariant , real and colorless ( color - singlet ) quantity , i.e. , it can be considered as a physical quantity .",
    "in fact , in this paper we have formulated a renormalization program to make the bag constant or , equivalently , the bag pressure finite and satisfying all other necessary requirements ( see section 8 above ) .",
    "the key elements of this program were the necessary subtractions at all levels .",
    "moreover , one of its attractive features , as emphasized above , is that it is the energy density of the purely transversal virtual gluon field configurations which are not only stable ( no imaginary part ) , but are being in the stationary state as well , i.e. , in the state with the minimum of energy ( see fig .",
    "that is why it makes sense to discuss the `` releasing '' of the bag constant from the vacuum , more precisely the bag energy ( b.4 ) .    from the quantum statistical mechanics point of view , the energy is nothing but the pressure multiplied by the volume @xmath187 in the infinite - volume limit @xcite .",
    "so the vacuum energy @xmath188 in terms of the bag constant is and in @xmath189 units it diverges as follows :    @xmath190    since @xmath191 always when the dimensionless uv cutoff @xmath192 goes to infinity . evidently , in deriving eq .",
    "( d.1 ) we use the general relation @xmath193 , which is valid in any units for energy ( see appendix b above ) .",
    "let us imagine now that we can release the finite portion @xmath171 ( b.4 ) from the vacuum in @xmath194 different places ( different `` vacuum energy releasing facilities '' ( verf ) ) .",
    "it can be done by @xmath195 times in each place , where @xmath196 .",
    "then the releasing energy @xmath197 becomes    @xmath198    the ideal case ( which , however , will never be achieved ) is when we could extract a finite portion of the energy an infinite number of times and in an infinite number of places .",
    "so the releasing energy ( d.2 ) might be divergent as follows :    @xmath199    since the sum over @xmath200 diverges quadratically in the @xmath201 limit , and @xmath202 in this case .",
    "the difference between the vacuum energy ( d.1 ) and the releasing energy ( d.3 ) which is nothing but the remaining in the vacuum energy @xmath203 becomes    @xmath204 , \\quad",
    "\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty,\\ ] ]    i.e. , the qcd vacuum is an infinite and permanent reservoir of energy .",
    "the situation is even `` better '' if one takes into account the pt contributions to the vacuum energy ( in this case the convergence becomes of the order @xmath205 in eq .",
    "( d.4 ) , see our preliminary work in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    that s the vacuum energy is badly divergent is not a mathematical problem .",
    "this reflects an universal reality .",
    "vacuum is everywhere and it always exists . quite possible that our universe in general and our real word in particular is only its special type of excitation due to the big bang . as underlined above , the vacuum is an infinite and hence a permanent source of energy . the only problem is how to release the finite portion  the bag energy ( b.4 ) and whether it will be profitable or not by introducing some type of cyclic process .",
    "however , due to huge difference between the two numbers ( b.4 ) and ( b.5 ) such a cyclically profitable process may be realistic .",
    "_ `` perpetuum mobile '' does not exist , but `` perpetuum source '' of energy does exist , and it is the qcd ground state_.",
