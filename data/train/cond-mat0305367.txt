    "since the advent of the theory of superconductivity , developed by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer [ bcs ]  @xcite and their contemporaries , bogoliubov  @xcite and valatin @xcite , countless investigations with these formalisms have been performed in a variety of fields .",
    "this widespread application of the bcs approach is due not only to its power and utility but also because superior approximate or exact solutions are generally not available .",
    "this is especially true in nuclear  @xcite and hadronic structure  @xcite where physical insight has been limited by uncertainties due to approximations .",
    "hence , further assessing the validity of the bcs approximation is an important endeavor with broad attending interest .",
    "in particular , there have been several studies @xcite of the bcs approximation within the hubbard model for which exact solutions , such as those provided by the bethe ansatz  @xcite , are known but only in one dimension .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend these investigations in several new directions : 1 ) assess the bcs approximation for not only the hubbard but also a reduced hubbard - like hamiltonian ; 2 ) in addition to energies and energy gaps also examine propagators and correlation observables ; 3 ) evaluate the bcs accuracy in two dimensions .    in discussing the hubbard model",
    "it is natural to restrict ourselves to a fixed filling because the hamiltonian conserves electron number .",
    "therefore we utilize the canonical bcs formulation with a fixed number of electrons .",
    "this is superior to the grand canonical approach which only constrains the average electron number and also produces a higher ground state energy . a previous pioneering study  @xcite notably detailed the excellent ground state energy agreement between the exact hubbard model and the approximate canonical bcs solution .",
    "however that work also determined , depending upon electron density , that the hubbard and bcs energy gaps do deviate , again in one dimension .",
    "related , an odd filling bcs application  @xcite in one dimension also found somewhat less precise results . because the bcs approximation is conjectured to improve in higher dimension  @xcite , it is important to perform a numerical assessment in two dimensions .    when computing with the bcs ground state many of the terms in the hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath0 , become irrelevant since only components which are either diagonal in momentum space or create and destroy momentum modes in pairs contribute .",
    "truncation to these remnant terms defines the reduced hamiltonian , @xmath1 , which is specified in the next section where the bcs hubbard ground state energy , @xmath2 , is found degenerate with the bcs reduced hamiltonian value . because @xmath0 contains further terms describing additional dynamics we a priori expect @xmath2 to better approximate the exact reduced hamiltonian ground state energy , @xmath3 , than the exact hubbard ground state energy , @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , as we detail below @xmath2 is an order of magnitude closer to @xmath5 than @xmath4 even though the variational treatment is very good for both .",
    "consequently a more complete bcs assessment , especially for systems modeled by @xmath1 , should address other observables which , in contrast to energies , are more sensitive to wavefunction details .",
    "accordingly , we also calculate electron pair propagators , wavefunction inner products and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8-wave correlators which are important for establishing superconductivity .",
    "this paper is divided into four sections . in section",
    "ii the hubbard and reduced hamiltonians are introduced and a new formulation of the canonical bcs method is derived .",
    "this section also details formulas for energy gaps , densities , propagators and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8-wave correlators .",
    "section iii compares and discusses numerical results for a variety of electron level fillings and different number of lattice sites .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "we follow the literature notation , especially refs .   and , and recall the full hubbard hamiltonian in momentum space @xmath9 the reduced hamiltonian retains the non - diagonal ( @xmath10 ) terms with @xmath11 and diagonal ( @xmath12 ) terms @xmath13 in the above equations @xmath14 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with momentum @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 @xmath17 or @xmath18 . in one dimension",
    "the electron kinetic energy is @xmath19 , while in two dimensions , @xmath20 , with hopping rate @xmath21 ( set to @xmath22 in this work ) between nearest neighbors .",
    "the momenta are restricted to multiples of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the linear extent of the system .",
    "the number of sites @xmath25 is @xmath24 in one dimension or @xmath26 in two dimensions .",
    "note that the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hr ] ) can be expressed in terms of a sum over the dummy index @xmath27 yielding @xmath28 , the product of spin up , @xmath29 , and down , @xmath30 , electron number operators for a system having @xmath25 total lattice sites .",
    "since we restrict this discussion to the attractive hubbard model the potential coupling parameter @xmath31 is negative .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian , @xmath1 , has been chosen to only contain elements of @xmath0 which have non - zero expectation values in the bcs state defined in the next section .",
    "we adopt the formulation of ref .   but present an alternate bcs derivation . for a given hamiltonian , the bcs approximation entails using the unnormalized variational wavefunction @xmath32 to minimize the ground state energy .",
    "here @xmath33 are the variational parameters and @xmath34 represents the vacuum state with no electrons .",
    "note that the above hamiltonians conserve particle number , but the state @xmath35 includes a mixture of fock components with different particle number . because we are interested in states with fixed fillings we organize these components by electron number @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 here and below the cryptic summation notation @xmath40",
    "is used to represent the sum over all unordered sets of momentum coordinates , @xmath41 , with the restriction that all of the momenta are different .    for a physical system with @xmath42 electrons the bcs ground state energy , @xmath2 ,",
    "is calculated by minimizing the expectation value @xmath43 @xmath44 i.e. @xmath45 where the minimization is achieved by varying the @xmath33 as detailed below .    before proceeding several points",
    "are in order .",
    "first , in the grand canonical bcs formulation the ground state energy is obtained by minimizing @xmath46 . using eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) one can show that the grand canonical is greater than the minimum canonical energy .",
    "second , combining eqs .",
    "( [ h],[hr],[bcsn ] ) directly yields the degenerate result @xmath47 verifying , as stated above , that the bcs ground state energy is the same for both hamiltonians .",
    "this is also true for the grand canonical bcs energy .",
    "third , the successive operation of @xmath1 on @xmath34 only generates states having electrons paired just like the state @xmath48 with opposite momentum and spin , called cooper pairs . in general , the exact hubbard ground state will contain additional electron correlations between such pairs and the bcs approach assumes these correlations can be ignored .",
    "now , we compute the norm of the fock state @xmath49 and the unnormalized kinetic energy @xmath50 the modified summation index @xmath51 now denotes the sum over all unordered sets of momentum coordinates , @xmath52 , with the stronger restriction that all momenta in the extended set , @xmath53 , are different . for the potential energy",
    "we first calculate @xmath54 then the unnormalized potential energy matrix element is @xmath55 note well that the sum over the set @xmath56 ensures @xmath57 . now define @xmath58 and @xmath59 which both vanish if any two momenta are equal , to express @xmath60 as @xmath61    next , we evaluate the bcs variational equation for a state with @xmath36 electrons @xmath62 by first calculating @xmath63 then we use the product rule for differentiating , @xmath64 to obtain @xmath65 solving for @xmath66 yields @xmath67 with the denominator , @xmath68 equation ( [ gp ] ) is equivalent to eq . ( 34 ) of ref .",
    "( note their equation has a misprint involving a missing @xmath66 ) .    in the case of odd filling , @xmath69",
    ", the variational state has a single specific unpaired , say up , electron with momentum @xmath70 , chosen to minimize the energy :    @xmath71    operating with the hamiltonian on this state shifts the energy by @xmath72 and repeating the above analysis yields @xmath73 where @xmath74 is equivalent to @xmath75 defined on a space with the @xmath70 mode removed .",
    "finally , the odd electron system variational equation reduces to @xmath76 where    @xmath77      using parpack , a parallel implementation of the lanczos algorithm , we exactly calculated the hubbard and reduced hamiltonian ground states as a function of the electron density .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space for a 16 site hubbard model is @xmath78 .",
    "since the hamiltonians conserve momentum and particle number we may restrict to subspaces with fixed momentum and filling .",
    "however , the dimension for half - filling at @xmath79 momentum is still greater than @xmath80 .",
    "there are about 2000 non - zero terms for each state , so the hubbard hamiltonian matrix can not be stored in memory even in a sparse format .",
    "instead , matrix elements were generated at each step in the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the diagonalization took about 3 hours using 30 1.2 ghz athlon processors in parallel .",
    "for even @xmath36 , we restrict to the zero momentum subspace which yields the minimum energy eigenvector . for odd @xmath42 , the momentum with lowest ground state energy is dependent on the coupling @xmath31 . for @xmath81 it is obvious that the lowest energy will have the momentum of the @xmath82th lowest energy mode . for high @xmath31 , with less than half filling",
    ", the lowest energy will have @xmath79 momentum , but for the value @xmath83 used throughout this paper , the momentum is the same as for @xmath81 .",
    "the total momentum of the ground state for odd @xmath42 corresponds to occupation of a specific unpaired momentum mode . for the hubbard model , occupation of this mode",
    "is not fixed by the action of the hamiltonian but , for the reduced model , all relevant basis states have the same unpaired mode . in this regard",
    ", the reduced model ground state is the same as the bcs state which has the single unpaired mode @xmath70 ( eq . [ eq : bcsodd ] ) .      to properly assess any approximation scheme , as well as investigate the robustness of a particular dynamic model , it is important to calculate and compare a variety of observables and theoretical constructs",
    "in addition to the ground state energy , @xmath4 , and energy density , @xmath84 , another important observable is the single particle energy gap , @xmath85 , @xmath86 \\nonumber \\\\          & = & \\frac{1 } { 2 } [ e_{n_e + 1 } - 2e_{n_e } + e_{n_e - 1 } ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the grand canonical formulation , a quasi - particle excitation is produced by the action of @xmath87 , or equivalently , @xmath88 on the state @xmath48  @xcite with excitation energy @xmath89 here",
    "@xmath90 is the bcs gap and @xmath91 is dependent on the momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the minimum excitation is non - zero since @xmath92 , thus accounting for the name `` gap '' . in the canonical bcs formulation @xmath93",
    "is no longer proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 averages the effects of adding and subtracting one electron .",
    "because wavefunctions are more sensitive than energies to approximation schemes , we also address other operator wavefunction overlaps such as propagators and correlators  @xcite . before introducing theses constructs",
    "we first specify the generalized one , @xmath95 , and two , @xmath96 , particle density matrices for any model state @xmath97 with unit norm @xmath98 @xmath99 here the indices @xmath100 represent possible electron lattice sites .",
    "the position operators , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , are related to the momentum operators by @xmath103 @xmath104 between states with the same filling @xmath105 , while @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the one electron propagators for spin up or down , respectively .",
    "next we construct a variety of correlators as the difference between a specific two particle density and the product of one particle densities .",
    "for example , the on site @xmath6-wave correlator , @xmath108 , is @xmath109 which is the correlated electron pair propagator minus the product of two ( independent ) one electron propagators .",
    "the extended @xmath6-wave correlator , @xmath110 , is @xmath111 which involves a sum , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , over the four planar sites adjacent to lattice site @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) with weights @xmath116 given by @xmath117 for @xmath118 or @xmath119 and @xmath120 otherwise .",
    "we also list in table i several other correlators , @xmath121 , with different symmetry weights @xmath122 which are important for investigating superconductivity .",
    "see ref .   for illustrations and further discussion .",
    "correlator & @xmath121 & non - zero @xmath123 terms + @xmath6-wave & @xmath124 & @xmath125 + @xmath126 & @xmath127 & @xmath128 + @xmath129 & @xmath130 & @xmath131 + @xmath8-wave & @xmath132 & @xmath133 + @xmath134 & @xmath135 & @xmath136 +    since our system has translational symmetry , the correlator , @xmath137 , and propagator , @xmath138 , do not depend on @xmath114 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath139    as discussed in ref .  ,",
    "an effective measure of superconductivity is the concept of off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) which can be quantitatively characterized by the correlator or odlro function , @xmath140 .",
    "the criterion for demonstrating superconductivity is that @xmath140 remains finite , positive and does not decrease to zero at large @xmath114 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pos1 ] , [ eq : pos2 ] ) , the propagator can be written in momentum space as @xmath141 where @xmath142 thus @xmath143 and evaluating @xmath140 in momentum space yields @xmath144 in particular for d - wave symmetry @xmath145 the other correlators were calculated similarly .",
    "we first compute for a one dimensional lattice the approximate bcs and exact hubbard and reduced hamiltonians ground state energies as a function of level filling . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e1 ] the hubbard ( boxes ) , @xmath84 , reduced ( circles ) , @xmath146 , and bcs ( crosses ) , @xmath147 , ground state energy densities are compared as a function of electron filling , @xmath42 , for @xmath148 , @xmath149 sites and @xmath150 .",
    "the bcs and exact hubbard data reproduce the data in refs .   and .",
    "as they reported , the agreement is very good , especially for the case of even filling .",
    "the exact reduced data is indistinguishable from the bcs data in the figure . over 99% of the difference between the bcs and the exact hubbard",
    "is due to the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 and only 1% is due to quantum correlations between different bcs pairs which are excluded by the variational wavefunction .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other potential strengths and different number of lattice sites ( not shown ) .    the hubbard ( boxes ) , reduced ( circles ) and bcs ( crosses ) energy gaps , @xmath85 , are compared in fig . [ fig : g1 ] . as with the ground state energy ,",
    "the bcs gap is the same for either the hubbard or reduced hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast to energy density comparisons , the bcs - hubbard difference is more pronounced especially for half - filling , @xmath151 .",
    "the bcs is still a good treatment for the reduced hamiltonian .",
    "having reproduced and extended one dimensional studies , we now address two dimensional systems .",
    "figure 3 depicts the hubbard , reduced and bcs energy densities for a two dimensional lattice having @xmath152 sites .    again",
    "the bcs energies are close to the exact hubbard eigenvalues and indistinguishable from the reduced eigenvalues .",
    "the corresponding energy gap comparisons are displayed in fig .",
    "contrary to conjecture , the difference between the exact and bcs energy gaps remains similar to the one dimensional case .",
    "we further note that the hubbard and reduced energy eigenvalues are generally in reasonably good agreement for all electron densities in both one and two dimensions .",
    "accordingly , it would appear that the reduced hamiltonian incorporates the dominant physical dynamics .",
    "this is fortuitous because @xmath1 can be solved more easily than @xmath0 , whether by the bcs approximation or by diagonalization , which in turn facilitates investigating more complex systems in multi - dimensions .",
    "in general , a variational calculation reproduces the ground state energy much better than other observables .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine the overlap of the bcs and exact model wavefunctions .",
    "figure [ fig : ov1 ] plots the inner product of the exact , one dimensional hubbard eigenvector with the bcs state as a function of electron filling .",
    "notice the significant deviation from unity especially with increasing density .",
    "as before , the bcs and hubbard results have the largest difference for systems near half - filling and odd number of electrons . in two dimensions",
    "the overlap behavior is similar but now the values are significantly higher ( see fig . [",

    "figures [ fig : p1_15 ] and [ fig : p2_15 ] compare the different model single electron propagators again in one and two dimensions , respectively , but now @xmath156 . notice that , just like the model energy comparisons , the hubbard and reduced propagators are more different for odd @xmath42 , but again the bcs accurately reproduces the reduced results .",
    "although lower @xmath42 hubbard - reduced comparisons yield even larger devations ( not shown ) , overall there is no significant difference in agreement between the two propagators in both one and two dimensions .",
    "figures [ fig : s1_16 ] and [ fig : s2_16 ] similarly compare the hubbard , reduced and bcs electron @xmath6-wave correlators , @xmath159 , for @xmath160 in one and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "now there are significant departures between the hubbard and reduced results .",
    "notice that the reduced correlator has a larger magnitude than the hubbard value .",
    "this is consistent with the energy gap comparison , where the reduced gap was larger than the hubbard gap . also , but not shown , lower @xmath42 yields smaller hubbard - reduced correlator differences .",
    "the bcs again very accurately reproduces the reduced correlators .",
    "the hubbard and reduced @xmath6-wave correlators are closer in two dimensions than in one dimension but the limited range of @xmath8 sampled warrants caution in this conclusion . by the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , the hubbard model will not display long range correlations at @xmath161 in one or two dimensions .",
    "however , according to the bethe ansatz@xcite , at least for large @xmath162 , the ground state energy of the one - dimensional system becomes part of a continuous spectrum as the system length increases .",
    "the theorem does not apply at @xmath163 under these circumstances and therefore long distance correlations are possible .",
    "the limited data shown in figures [ fig : s1_16 ] and [ fig : s2_16 ] are inconclusive on the question of long distance order .",
    "conversely , the bcs and reduced odlro functions are flat for increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem does not apply to the reduced hamiltonian , even at @xmath161 , because it has long range interactions . for the ground state of the reduced hamiltonian",
    ", the @xmath6-wave correlator reduces to @xmath164 the second term decreases linearly with @xmath25 for large @xmath165 , but the first term is independent of @xmath165 and approaches a constant as @xmath25 increases . for @xmath166 ,",
    "this constant is @xmath167 .",
    "a precise limit can also be given for the bcs correlator at finite @xmath25 .",
    "resummation of the correlator yields terms independent of @xmath165 , @xmath168 with additional terms decreasing rapidly to @xmath79 with increasing @xmath165 .",
    "the hubbard , reduced and bcs electron @xmath6-wave correlators , @xmath159 , for @xmath169 are compared in figs .",
    "[ fig : s1_15 ] and [ fig : s2_15 ] for one and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "the differences are more dramatic for odd fillings as the hubbard correlator in one dimension falls rapidly to @xmath79 .",
    "the two dimensional hubbard correlator also falls rapidly within the limited range in @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , the bcs and reduced models , with a single specific unpaired electron mode , still exhibit long range correlations .",
    "the @xmath7-wave correlators , @xmath170 , are plotted and compared in figs .",
    "[ fig : p1_16 ] , [ fig : p2_16 ] , [ fig : p1_15 ] and [ fig : p2_15 ] for different fillings and dimensions . both interesting and somewhat surprising",
    "is that the differences between the bcs and reduced correlators are now discernable , especially in 2 dimensions .",
    "since these two model wavefunctions are identical to within 1 part in @xmath171 , this indicates that the @xmath7-wave correlator is a very sensitive wavefunction probe as this correlator s matrix elements are dominated by a very small portion of the state vector .",
    "this result also reflects the small @xmath7-wave correlator magnitude .",
    "none of the models exhibit strong long range order or significant @xmath172 correlations .",
    "finally , the differences between hubbard and reduced @xmath7-wave correlators are dramatic for both one and two dimensions with even or odd filling .    finally , the @xmath8-wave correlators , @xmath132 , were calculated in two dimensions ( figs .",

    "the magnitudes are small for non - zero @xmath8 and the differences between the hubbard and reduced correlators are dramatic .",
    "the differences between the reduced and bcs correlators are again present .",
    "the major thrust of this work has been to further numerically assess the accuracy of the bcs approximation . by applying this approximation to multi - electron systems governed by both the hubbard and a simpler , reduced hamiltonian , each exactly diagonalizable",
    ", it has been documented that the bcs provides an excellent description of ground state energies in both one and two dimensions .",
    "however , the bcs single particle energy gaps are less accurate , in both one and two dimensions , especially near half filling .",
    "this undermines previous assertions that the bcs approximation improves with increasing dimension .",
    "further , propagators , overlaps and correlators have been found to be quite sensitive to both interactions and approximations as the bcs and reduced model predictions are appreciably different than the hubbard results .",
    "the slow decrease of the hubbard and reduced hamiltonian odlro propagators and correlator functions with increasing lattice separation is evidence for superconductivity .",
    "however correlations , and thus the degree of superconductivity , are much stronger in the reduced model . finally , the bcs method extremely accurately reproduces all reduced model observables .    in summary ,",
    "our results challenge the validity of the bcs method as a good , comprehensive approximation to the attractive hubbard model .",
    "while the hubbard and bcs correlators both exhibit long - range order , their variations with distance are quite different .",
    "because agreement between correlators and inner - product overlaps improves to some extent with dimension , perhaps in three dimensions the bcs method may yet be a very accurate alternative to exact hubbard model wavefunctions but further study is necessary .",
    "finally , for physical systems where the interactions embodied in the reduced hamiltonian dominate , the bcs approximation will be a very accurate approximation scheme permitting significantly more ambitious numerical investigations .",
