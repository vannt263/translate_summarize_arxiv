    "<S> this setting , which may be implemented in optics and bose - einstein condensates , aims to extend previous studies , which dealt with single - well nonlinear potentials . in the 1d setting , we find several types of symmetric , asymmetric and antisymmetric states , focusing on scenarios of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the single - well model is extended by including rocking motion of the well , which gives rise to rabi oscillations between the fundamental and dipole modes . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the 2d single - well setting gives rise to stable modes in the form of ordinary dipoles , vortex - antivortex dipoles ( vads ) , and vortex triangles ( vts ) , which may be considered as produced by spontaneous breaking of the axial symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of the dw configuration in 2d reveals diverse types of modes built of components trapped in the two wells , which may be fundamental states and vortices with topological charges @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as vads ( with @xmath2 ) and vts ( with @xmath3 ) . </S>"
