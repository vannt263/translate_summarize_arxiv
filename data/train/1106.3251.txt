    "the transient high mass x - ray binary pulsar gx 304 - 1 ( 4u 1258 - 61 ) was discovered in a balloon observation in 1967 .",

    "x - ray pulsations with a period of @xmath0272 s were detected from _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "pulsations were detected up to about 10 kev and the pulse profile was characterised by a single broad peak along with a weak second peak .",
    "the spectrum of gx 304 - 1 was found to be relatively hard with a photon index ( @xmath1 ) of 1.5 @xmath2 0.2 .",
    "an important feature of this source is the presence of strong flares with a duration of @xmath0100 s @xcite .",

    "m_@xmath3 = 15 shell star with strong double peaked h@xmath4 emission and spectral type b2 vne @xcite . the mean x - ray luminosity of gx 304 - 1 was measured to be @xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 at d=2@xmath21 kpc .",
    "the source was thus added to a list of low - luminosity slowly - pulsating x - ray sources associated with be stars @xcite . the remarkably large , blue shifted o@xmath7 @xmath8 7773 absorption feature in the counterpart of gx 304 - 1 confirms its identification as a shell star , a subclass of be stars @xcite , for which a considerable amount of ejected mass forms an equatorially expanding shell around the star .",
    "long term behaviour of this source , studied using data obtained from the _ vela _ satellite revealed a 132.5 day periodicity . in the absence of any other periodicity in this source ,",
    "the 132.5 day feature was interpreted as the orbital period of the neutron star , in an eccentric orbit with the be star companion . in the year 1986 , _ exosat _ observations were made , during the time an outburst was expected from this source . the flux measured in the low ( 0.03 - 2.4 kev ) and medium ( 2 - 6 kev ) energy range were both 3 @xmath9 10@xmath10 erg cm @xmath11 s@xmath6 only .",
    "this was a factor of 25 below the quiescent flux level reported before 1980 using other satellites , and it was concluded that the source was in an `` off state '' . follow up studies of the low x - ray activity of this source with optical observations attributed the decreased activity to a drastic change in the shell structure of the companion star .",
    "long term optical spectroscopic and photometric studies carried out in the 1980s indicated that the optical companion is in an inactive state having apparently lost part of its envelope @xcite .",

    "pulse profiles of x - ray pulsars help us in understanding the pulsar geometry and beaming patterns .",
    "most of the accretion powered x - ray pulsars exhibit strong intensity and energy dependence of pulse profiles and studies related to this provide insight regarding the relative contributions from the matter along the accretion column as well as from the scattering atmospheres formed surrounding the column .",
    "aperiodic variabilities like quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are seen in several transient as well as persistent high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) pulsars that are thought to arise due to the inhomogeneities in the inner accretion disk@xmath12 mainly the region where the accretion disk interacts with the pulsar magnetosphere .",

    "be / x - ray binaries are observed to be transient sources in x - rays exhibiting recurrent outbursts which imply episodic accretion of material during the course of its evolution .",

    "while there is no straightforward interpretation of pulse profile changes with time and energy , we find that near the end of the decay of the outburst , the pulse profile has a single broad peak and less energy dependence .",
    "in contrast , during the peak and first half of the decay of the outburst , the pulse profile is complex , with greater level of complexity at lower energy .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectroscopy indicates that the strong energy dependence of the pulse profile can be due to a combination of pulse phase dependence in the underlying continuum emission and pulse phase locked partial covering .",
    "the energy spectra of most accreting x - ray pulsars can be well described by a simple model consisting of an absorbed power - law with a high - energy cut - off ( around 10@xmath1220 kev in most cases ) and a gaussian component for the iron line fluorescence emission .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of gx 304 - 1 does not give an acceptable fit with this simple model .",
    "instead it requires a partial covering model which fits the source spectrum quite well . in this case , a part of the emission from the source is blocked from the observers line - of - sight by material in the accretion column that is spinning with the neutron star .",
    "the ratio of the pulse phase averaged spectrum obtained on different days of the outburst with the same during the peak of the outburst ( left panel of figure 9 ) shows a significant spectral evolution . as the outburst decayed , the spectrum became softer up to about 15 kev and there was a possible hardening of the spectrum above 15 kev .",
    "the spectral parameters measured from these spectra ( right panel of figure 9 ) show a corresponding gradual increase in the spectral index .",
    "emergence of a hard component above 15 kev during the decay of the outburst shows a corresponding increase in the covering fraction and the column density of the partial covering component .",
    "becker and wolff ( 2007 ) computed the expected x - ray spectrum of accretion powered high magnetic field pulsars from bulk and thermal comptonization of seed photons in the accretion column .",
    "the pulse phase averaged and accretion column height integrated x - ray spectrum that emerges from such sources have a power - law shape with a high energy cut - off as is seen in gx 304 - 1 .",
    "the computed x - ray spectrum has a low energy turn - over also ( becker & wolff 2005 ) , which in empirical spectral modeling is often ascribed to an absorption column density .",
    "rxte_-pca data presented here does not include this energy band below 3 kev . with decreasing x - ray luminosity",
    ", the x - ray spectrum may also show a softening , as is seen in gx 304 - 1 .",
    "however , these effects have not yet been quantified and so a direct comparison with the measured spectra can not be made .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectral analysis shows a strong variation in the partial covering parameters over phase , supporting the scenario .",
    "similar properties have been seen in a few other hmxbs like 1a 1118 - 61 @xcite and gro j1008 - 67 @xcite . in these sources ,",
    "a large increase in the column density of the partial covering component is compatible with a scenario in which the accretion stream from the inner accretion disk to the pulsar is narrow and phase locked , causing a partial absorption of the emitting region in certain pulse phases . while the scenario presented here for gx 304 - 1 and elsewhere for 1a 1118 - 61 and gro j1008 - 57",
    "are entirely consistent , a rather high value of n@xmath62 is found in certain pulse phases . it can not be ruled out that the observed spectral variation and pulse phase dependence can also be modeled with multiple hard x - ray emission components with independent pulse phase dependencies , provided consistent with the pulsar emission models ( becker & wolff 2007 ) .",
    "we have carried out an extensive timing and spectral analysis of _",
    "rxte_-pca observations of the transient x - ray pulsar gx 304 - 1 during an outburst in 2010 .",
    "the key results obtained are    * detection of qpos , along with a harmonic which is rare in x - ray pulsars .",
    "the magnetic field estimated using the qpo frequency and the x - ray luminosity is comparable to the one estimated from the cyclotron absorption feature in this source .",
    "* the pulse profile varied from a complex shape during the outburst to a simple profile near the end of the outburst . during the bright state ,",
    "the pulse profile had a complex energy dependence , with multiple peaks in the low energy band and a single peak with an absorption dip in the high energy band .",
    "this indicates the presence of a source spectrum with multiple , pulse phase dependent components . *",
    "the x - ray spectrum softened as the outburst decayed , and showed presence of strong partial covering absorption on some days .",
    "* pulse phase resolved spectroscopy , carried out on some observations showed large absorption column density in some pulse phases , which can be caused by absorption in narrow , phase locked accretion streams .",
