    "the obscuring torus around active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is the key ingredient to unifying different types of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of matter in the torus was considered to be clumpy in early theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "this implies that the classification of agn is a probability of direct view of agn @xcite .",
    "the dust in the torus absorbs the radiation from the central agn and re - radiates it in the infrared .",
    "while the simplified smooth model of torus was studied from early on , many detailed infrared observations point to clumpy distributions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .    the clumpy nature of the torus is also supported by x - ray absorption variations on timescales from days to years .",
    "different from dust emission in the infrared , obscuration of x - ray photons can be produced by dust - free gas within the sublimation radius .",
    "an extreme example is ngc 1365 , which shows an occultation of the central agn within 2 days , indicating that the obscuring clouds are located at similar distances to those of the broad line region ( blr , * ? ? ?",
    ". statistical study of eclipse events in the _ rxte _ ( rossi x - ray timing explorer ) archive data by @xcite showed that most of the clouds are located in the outer portion of the blr .",
    "recent hard x - ray monitoring of ngc 1068 by ( nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ) reveals flux variations above 20 kev , which imply a transition of the column density from @xmath8@xmath9 to @xmath10@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a continuous distribution of clouds from the blr to the parsec - scale torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray spectra of type ii agn with column densities larger than @xmath11@xmath9 are particularly suitable for the study of the torus , since their intrinsic continua are heavily obscured in the soft x - ray band .",
    "this is especially true for compton - thick agn ( with column densities @xmath12@xmath9 ) , the intrinsic continua of which are heavily suppressed below 10 kev , and the observed spectra are dominated by reflection emission from the torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a characteristic feature of the reflection spectrum is the prominent fe k@xmath13 emission line at 6.4 kev , which generally has an equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath14 kev for compton - thick agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath19 ( in units of 10@xmath20@xmath9 ) is the quoted column density of torus in recent literature . for ngc 2992",
    ", the fe @xmath0line of the heg spectrum has an ew @xmath21kev , which can be fitted with the scattered spectrum of the mytorus model with a column density @xmath22@xmath9 ( xu et al . in prep ) .",
    "a general feature of a clumpy torus is that soft x - ray photons , reflected from the back - side of the torus , are not significantly reduced due to their passage through the front free - of - obscuration regions between clumps @xcite .",
    "as shown by recent simulations , a clumpy torus provides significantly more soft x - ray photons than a smooth one when viewed edge - on , and the softer the photons , the larger the differences @xcite .",
    "the reflection spectrum can therefore be used to probe the matter distribution of the torus .",
    "for example , @xcite found that a multiple - component reflector is needed to fit the spectra of ngc 1068 .",
    "@xcite found that the spectra of ngc 424 , ngc 1320 , and ic 2560 are better fitted with a `` face - on '' component of mytorus model @xcite , which was suggested to mimic the leakage of soft x - ray photons from a clumpy torus @xcite .",
    "as the soft x - ray spectra of agn are generally contaminated by other components , such as emission from photo - ionized gas , it is hard to measure the pure reflected continuum in the soft x - ray band . instead",
    ", the non - fe fluorescent lines ( e.g. si @xmath0line at 1.74 kev ) emitted by the torus can be measured unambiguously , since they are unique line features that can not be confused with other components .",
    "because the fraction of leaked photons depends on energy , the flux ratios of the fe k@xmath13 line to non - fe @xmath0lines would be a good probe of the matter distribution of the torus .",
    "the non - fe fluorescent lines are generally weak , due to their small yields and relatively low abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , they are still observable , especially for compton - thick agn when the intrinsic continua are heavily suppressed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter we compile a sample of type ii agn , observed with high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) , to study their non - fe fluorescent lines , focusing on the si @xmath0line at 1.74 kev , which is generally the strongest of the non - fe fluorescent lines .",
    "we compare the measured flux ratios of @xmath1with simulation results of clump tori by @xcite .",
    "the fe k@xmath13/ni @xmath0ratio has been investigated previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "note that the errors quoted are for the 90% confidence level .",
    "the hetgs provides high resolution x - ray spectra for point - like sources @xcite .",
    "it consists of a high energy grating ( heg ) with a spectral resolution of 0.012   ( full width half maximum , fwhm ) and a medium energy grating ( meg ) with a resolution of 0.023  .",
    "the effective area of meg is about 3 times larger than that of heg around 1.74 kev , and drops quickly above 6 kev .",
    "we searched the hetgs archive for type ii agn having sufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to allow a reliable measurement of the si @xmath0line .",
    "we found a total of eight agn , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "the si @xmath0line is also detected in cen a , but its dust lane complicates the estimation of the real flux of the si @xmath0line and is therefore not included .",
    "although classified as seyfert 1.5 , 3c 445 has an x - ray spectrum similar to type ii agn ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been included in the list .",
    "the first five sources listed in table 1 are generally regarded as compton - thick agn , while the others are less obscured .",
    "many of the selected sources have already been studied in the literature for their fe @xmath0line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use the data downloaded from transmission grating data archive and catalog ( tgcat , * ? ? ?",
    "all the spectra are extracted from a region with a 2 arcsec half - width in the cross - dispersion direction , and the @xmath23 order data are combined together .",
    "the foreground galactic absorption column density is @xmath24@xmath9 and @xmath25@xmath9 for circinus and mrk 3 , respectively , and is negligible ( @xmath26@xmath9 ) for other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the si @xmath0line ( at 1.74 kev ) is adjacent to the  @xmath18line at 1.745 kev .",
    "for circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , their heg data are deep enough to resolve the peaks of these two lines , thus allowing the two lines to be measured simultaneously .",
    "in particular , the line width of the si @xmath0line can be measured with a spectral resolution 4 times better than that at 6.4 kev where the fe @xmath0line resides .",
    "measurements of the si @xmath0line of circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 were presented in @xcite .",
    "si @xmath0line widths are @xmath27 times smaller than those measured for the fe @xmath0line , indicating that the line - emitting regions are outside the dust sublimation radius .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details and for convenience , we have listed the relevant results in table 1 .",
    "for all the other sources , the heg data are not deep enough to allow a deblending of the si @xmath0line and the  @xmath18line .",
    "the heg spectra of these sources are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the si @xmath0line and the  @xmath18line are blended with each other .",
    "we fit the data with a model comprising one gaussian line plus a power - law continuum . to improve the s / n ratio ,",
    "the heg and meg data are fitted simultaneously .",
    "the fitting region is between 1.4 and 2.3 kev and neglecting the other main emission features .",
    "the fitted results are plotted in fig . 1 and listed in table 1 .",
    "we see that the one line model is sufficient to fit the data .",
    "if we replace the power - law continuum with a thermal continuum , the fitted intensities of si @xmath0line are generally consistent with those of the power - law model , with differences smaller than 2% .",
    "the contribution of the  @xmath18line can be estimated based on the fluxes of the  @xmath28line at 1.472 kev , which are also listed in table 1 .",
    "for circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , the fluxes of the  @xmath18line can be measured @xcite and the  ly@xmath29/  @xmath28ratios ( corrected for galactic absorption ) are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively . for photo - ionized plasmas , the emissivity ratio between  ly@xmath29 and  @xmath28is around @xmath33 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the measurement , the  ly@xmath29/  @xmath28ratios of circinus and ngc 1068 are consistent with photo - ionization models .",
    "for mrk 3 , the ratio is larger than the predictions of photo - ionization models .",
    "it is likely that the  ly@xmath29 line is over - estimated due to blending with the si @xmath0line @xcite . assuming a ratio of  ly@xmath29/  @xmath28of 0.2 , the contribution of the  @xmath18line to the measured fluxes of si @xmath0line is about 20% for all sources .",
    "the fluxes of the fe @xmath0line are measured using only the heg data .",
    "we also adopt the model of one gaussian line plus a power - law continuum .",
    "the fitting region is between 5 and 6.8 kev , and the measured fluxes are listed in table 1 . for reference , the ews of the samples measured from the fitted models are also included .",
    "the measured ews are generally larger than 0.3 kev , indicating the reflection - dominated nature of the x - ray spectra of the sample . from the measured fluxes of the si @xmath0and fe @xmath0line",

    "we see that they span a range between @xmath2 .",
    "the circinus galaxy has the largest @xmath1ratio around 60 , while the ratios of ngc 1068 , ngc 3393 , and ngc 2992 are as small as @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite simulated the reflection spectrum of a torus with clumpy distributions .",
    "the boundaries of the torus are defined by an inner radius of 0.1 pc , an outer radius of 2 pc , and a half - opening angle of 60@xmath35 .",
    "this corresponds to a covering factor of 0.5 for a smooth torus .",

    ", the @xmath1ratio follows the same trend , but with a smaller value when viewed edge - on .",
    "the more clumpy the torus , the smaller the ratio .",

    "the absorption becomes so severe that even no si @xmath0photons appeared on some sight - lines .",
    "nevertheless , the differences between the clumpy and smooth torus are similar to those for @xmath40@xmath9 .",
    "the torus of @xmath41@xmath9 is optically thick for fe @xmath0photons , and the absorption of fe @xmath0photons leads to a smaller @xmath1ratio when viewed edge - on compared with the @xmath40@xmath9 case .",

    "the viewing angle is assigned with an arbitrary value larger than the half - opening angle of the simulated geometry .",
    "for the type ii agn studied here , to obscure the central agn , the viewing angle must be larger than the half - opening angle of the torus .",
    "for compton - thick sources , the reflection - dominated spectra indicate that they are most likely to be viewed edge - on .",
    "we see that all the measured @xmath1ratios are far smaller than the predictions of the smooth torus with viewing angles larger than the half - opening angle of the torus .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of the tori of the sources is far from being smooth . for the simulated geometry of the clumpy torus ,",
    "only the @xmath1ratio of the circinus galaxy is close to the @xmath5 simulation results . for the other sources , the measured ratios are all below the simulation curve fir @xmath7",
    "x - ray fluorescent lines are unique features of the reflection spectrum of the torus around agn , and can be relatively easily detected for obscured type ii agn .",

    "the @xmath1ratios of the other sources are all below the results of the @xmath7 simulation .",
    "this implies a very clump distribution for the torus .",
    "below we discuss several factors that can affect the simulation results .",
    "a direct factor affecting the simulation results is the abundance pattern .",
    "@xcite adopted the solar abundances from @xcite , and no variable abundances are investigated .",
    "recent studies have reduced the solar fe abundance from @xmath42 ( number relative to h , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this will lead to a similar decrease in the predicted @xmath1ratio if the current abundance pattern is assumed .",
    "similarly , if the abundance ratio of fe / si is changed several times , the @xmath1ratio will also change similarly .    another uncertainty in the results",
    "is the photon index , @xmath44 , which is fixed at 1.8 in @xcite . for optically - thick material ,",
    "the emission of fluorescent lines is proportional to the available number of photons that can ionize the corresponding k - shell electrons .",
    "the relative number of photons at the ionization edge of si and fe will be increased for a large @xmath44 . to test the effect of @xmath44 ,",
    "we re - run the @xmath7 simulation using a @xmath44 of 2.2 .",
    "the results for @xmath40@xmath9 and @xmath8@xmath9 are plotted in fig .",
    "3 as dotted lines .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath41@xmath9 , the @xmath1ratios are reduced by a factor of @xmath45 , just as expected for optically - thick material . for @xmath40@xmath9 ,",
    "the material is not optically - thick for fe k - shell ionization yet , and the reduction in the ratio is less than the prediction for optically - thick material .",
    "another unexplored effect is the half - opening angle ( or covering factor ) , which is fixed to be 60@xmath35 . in principle",
    ", a smaller covering factor will allow more photons to reach the observer , since it means less obscuration by the front - side torus gas .",
    "the effect on soft photons would be more significant due to their larger absorption cross - sections .",
    "thus , smaller @xmath1ratios would be expected for smaller covering factors . to test the effect of covering factor",
    ", we also re - run the @xmath7 simulation by adopting a half - opening angle of 80@xmath35 , the results of which are plotted in fig .",
    "3 as dashed lines . for @xmath40@xmath9",
    ", the @xmath1ratio can be decreased by a factor of 2 for edge - on angles when using a half - opening angle of 80@xmath35 . for @xmath41@xmath9 , the effect of changing the half - opening angle is less significant , due to severe absorption and the isotropic nature of the emission .",
    "we note that the simulated column densities ( 10@xmath20 and 10@xmath38@xmath9 ) are not matched exactly with the observed ones of the torus that were determined from the smooth torus models , which are shown here to be invalid .",
    "it seems that by including all these factors and with a clumpy torus of @xmath46 or smaller , the measured relatively low @xmath1ratios ( @xmath34 ) can be obtained , without resort to abnormally low fe / si abundances .",
    "current simulations of clumpy tori are limited by the crude grid and fixed abundances , geometry , and photon spectrum .",
    "it is clear that a fittable clumpy model , including the effects of @xmath36 , @xmath44 , variable abundances and covering factors , is needed to fully understand the x - ray spectra of obscured agn and to constrain the clumpiness of the torus .",
    "such a model will be presented in a future work .",
    "the simulation of @xcite assumed that both the fe @xmath0and si @xmath0photons are from the same torus , with the si @xmath0photons from a thinner layer due to the larger absorption section at lower energy . in principle , the si @xmath0photons can arise from physically distinct clouds with @xmath47@xmath9 , for which the @xmath1ratio is reduced significantly . for sources with @xmath48@xmath9 and a covering factor @xmath49 ,",
    "the contribution of the si @xmath0photons from distinct clouds with @xmath47@xmath9 is unlikely to be significant , since the intensity of si @xmath0photons increases with column density until saturated for large optical depth . for the extreme case that clouds with @xmath47@xmath9",
    "cover another half sky , the reduction of the @xmath1ratio can not be larger than 50% .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of the origin of si @xmath0photons from distinct clouds could be important for sources with @xmath50@xmath9 .",
    "considering the contamination by the  @xmath18line to the si @xmath0line , the relatively isolated s @xmath0line at 2.3 kev would be a better probe .",
    "however , due to the quick decline of the effective area of heg around 2 kev , we found the s @xmath0line is only detectable in circinus , mrk 3 , and ngc 1068 , and the flux is similar to that of the si @xmath0line .",
    "nevertheless , the effective area around s , ar , and ca @xmath0lines would be improved for the soft x - ray calorimeter on - board astro - h , which would also enable a much larger sample of obscured agn .",
    "the results show that non - fe fluorescent lines are a potentially powerful probe of the clumpiness of the torus around agn .",
