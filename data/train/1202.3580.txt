    "impurities induce a finite scattering between the channels , however , due to the chiral nature of the electron dispersion , back - scattering is reduced .",

    "we point out that similar reasoning can be used for the ip wall configuration , there however , the supersymmetric hierarchy is constructed in @xmath146-space and thus , the @xmath12-integration performed in @xmath69 averages out the characteristic signature of the hierarchy .",
    "we remark that @xmath135 describes essentially a free particle in the pschl - teller potential , which is known to be reflectionless for certain parameters . in the reflectionless case",
    "however , a transmitted wave still acquires a phase which has consequences on a wave packet passing such a potential : it narrows and is ahead in time as compared to a freely moving wave - packet @xcite . for optical systems , these potentials have been realized recently using arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides @xcite .",
    "finally we comment briefly on experimental issues .",
    "a possible realization is to deposit an isolating ferromagnetic film on top of the topological insulator or alternatively , a metallic ferromagnet with a thin insulating barrier . while there is a broad range of tunable magnetic properties in metallic materials",

    "the observation of the predicted oscillations could be realized by placing an additional top - gate on the ferromagnetic insulator which can be used to tune the exchange field @xmath5 .",
    "the oscillations would still be visible if the ratio @xmath147 changes slowly enough .",
    "we have analytically calculated the ballistic dw conductance for in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic domain walls induced into the surface states of a topological insulator . for the in - plane dw , the dw conductance is dominated by the spectrum mismatch imposed by the opposite magnetization directions within the domains . for the out - of - plane dw , we unexpectedly find oscillations in the wall - width dependence with period @xmath49 ( magnetic length ) . in particular ,",
    "integer @xmath141 constitute a family of reflectionless potentials",
    ". we can understand these features using the idea of supersymmetry and find them to be a result of the dispersion of the topological surface states together with the specific tanh dw - profile .",
    "detecting the oscillatory dw resistance could be a unique signature of the chiral dirac surface states .",
