    "energy transport in dielectric crystals at low temperatures is limited by isotope mass disorder and by anharmonicities . for",
    "a crystal coupled to thermal heat baths , in a slab geometry , the total energy transported may in addition depend on how the bath is coupled to the boundaries of the bulk . in this paper",
    "we will ignore anharmonicities but study the two other effects in considerable depth .    based on empirical evidence ,",
    "one generically expects the validity of fourier s law ,  , for a slab in contact with heat reservoirs at different temperatures the average energy current , @xmath0 , should be proportional to @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the slab length .",
    "there have been many attempts to derive fourier s law from microscopic dynamics .",
    "using very reasonable physical assumptions of local equilibrium and the notion of the mean free path traveled by phonons between collisions yields a heuristic derivation of fourier s law .",
    "there is however no fully convincing derivation .",
    "there have also been many computer simulations of the heat flux in the nonequilibrium stationary states of anharmonic crystals kept in contact with thermal reservoirs at different temperatures , and theoretical analysis based on the green - kubo formalism @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest ( but there is no proof despite some claims ) that fourier law is not valid for one and two dimensional systems , even in the presence of anharmonic interactions , unless the system is also subjected to an external substrate pinning potential .",
    "generically it is found that , for a system in contact with heat reservoirs at different fixed temperatures , the heat current density @xmath0 scales anomalously with system length @xmath2 as j ~  , with @xmath3 .",
    "the effective thermal conductivity behaves then as @xmath4 where @xmath5 . for two dimensional systems",
    "there are some analytic studies which suggest @xmath6 .",
    "recent experiments on heat conduction in nanotubes and graphene flakes have reported observations which indicate such divergence of @xmath7 with system size @xcite .    for heat conduction in the ordered harmonic crystal",
    "there are exact results from which one has @xmath8 in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "heat conduction in a disordered harmonic crystal will be affected by anderson localization @xcite and by phonon scattering .",
    "in this paper we report results of heat conduction studies in @xmath9 and @xmath10 disordered harmonic lattices with scalar displacements , connected to heat baths modeled by langevin equations with white noise .",
    "we pay particular attention to the interplay between localization effects , boundary effects , and the role of long wavelength modes .",
    "the steady state heat current is given exactly as an integral over all frequencies of a phonon transmission coefficient .",
    "using this formula and heuristic arguments , based on localization theory and kinetic theory results , we estimate the system size dependence of the current .",
    "the main idea behind our arguments is that the phonon states can be classified as ballistic modes , diffusive modes and localized modes .",
    "the classification refers both to the character of the eigenfunctions as well as to their transmission properties .",
    "ballistic modes are spatially extended and approximately periodic ; their transmission is independent of system size .",
    "diffusive modes are extended but non - periodic and their transmission decays as @xmath1 . for localized modes transmission decays exponentially with @xmath2 . in the context of kinetic theory calculations ,",
    "the ballistic modes are the low frequency modes with phonon mean free path @xmath11 , and their contribution to the current leads to divergence of the thermal conductivity . here",
    "we will carefully examine the effect of boundary conditions on these modes .",
    "numerically we use two different approaches to study the nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "the first is a numerical one which relies on the result that the current can be expressed in terms of a transmission coefficient .",
    "this transmission coefficient can be written in terms of phonon green s functions and we implement efficient numerical schemes to evaluate this . the second approach is through direct nonequilibrium simulations of the langevin equations of motion and finding the steady state current and temperature profiles .",
    "we have also studied properties of the isolated system , , of the disordered lattice without coupling to heat baths and looked at the normal mode frequency spectrum and the wavefunctions .",
    "one measure of the degree of localization of the normal modes of the isolated system is the so - called inverse participation ratio [ ipr , defined in eq .",

    "we have carried out studies of the ipr and linked these with the results from the transmission study .",
    "* phonon localization : * this is closely related to the electron localization problem .",
    "the effect of localization on linear waves in disordered media has been most extensively studied in the context of the schrdinger equation for non - interacting electrons moving in a disordered potential .",
    "looking at the eigenstates and eigenfunctions of the isolated system of a single electron in a disordered potential one finds that , in contrast to the spatially extended bloch states in periodic potentials , there are now many eigenfunctions which are exponentially localized in space .",
    "it was argued by mott and twose @xcite and by borland @xcite , and proven rigorously by goldsheid  @xcite , that in one dimension ( @xmath12 ) all states are exponentially localized . in two dimensions ( @xmath9 ) there is no proof but it is believed that again all states are localized . in three dimensions ( @xmath10 )",
    "there is expected to be a transition from extended to localized states as the energy is moved towards the band edges @xcite .",
    "the transition from extended to localized states , which occurs when the disorder is increased , changes the system from a conductor to an insulator .",
    "the connection between localization and heat transport in a crystal is complicated by the fact that phonons of all frequencies can contribute to energy transmission across the system . in particular account",
    "has to be taken of the fact that low frequency phonon modes are only weakly affected by disorder and always remain extended .",
    "the heat current carried by a mode which is localized on a length scale @xmath13 , decays with system length @xmath2 as @xmath14 .",
    "this @xmath13 depends on the phonon frequency and low frequency modes for which @xmath15 will therefore be carriers of the heat current .",
    "the net current then depends on the nature of these low frequency modes and their scattering due to boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "a renormalization group study of phonon localization in a continuum vector displacement model was carried out by john   @xcite .",
    "they found that much of the predictions of the scaling theory of localization for electrons carry over to the phonon case .",
    "specifically they showed that in one and two dimensions all non - zero frequency phonons are localized with the low frequency localization length diverging as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ( where @xmath18 is some constant ) .",
    "this means that in @xmath12 all modes with @xmath19 are localized while in @xmath9 all modes with @xmath20^{-1/2}$ ] are localized . in @xmath10",
    "the prediction is that there is an @xmath21 independent of @xmath2 above which all modes are localized .",
    "however this study does not make any statements on the system size dependence of the conductivity .",
    "* kinetic theory : * if one considers the low frequency extended phonons , then the effect of disorder is weak and in dimensions @xmath22 one expects that localization effects can be neglected and kinetic theory should be able to provide an accurate description . in this case",
    "one can think of rayleigh scattering of phonons .",
    "this gives an effective mean free path @xmath23 [ see appendix  [ sec : appa ] ] , for dimensions @xmath22 , and a diffusion constant @xmath24 where @xmath25 , the sound velocity , can be taken to be a constant . for a finite system of linear dimension",

    "* simulation results : * there have been only few simulation studies of heat conduction in three dimensional disordered systems and none have been definitive concerning the validity of fourier s law @xcite . in two dimension a diverging thermal conductivity was reported in @xcite .",

    "the precise definitions of the different bcs will be given later .",
    "here we explain the different physical situations they correspond to .",
    "if we model the heat reservoirs themselves by infinite ordered harmonic crystals then langevin type equations for the system @xcite are obtained on eliminating the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "the two different bcs then emerge naturally .",
    "fixed bcs correspond to reservoirs with properties different from the system ( _ e.g. _ different spring constants ) and in this case one finds that effectively the particles at the boundaries ( those coupled to reservoirs ) experience an additional harmonic pinning potential .",
    "free bcs correspond to the case where the reservoir is simply an extension of the system ( without disorder ) and in this case the end particles are unpinned .",
    "free bcs have been studied in the literature in the context of heat conduction in one dimensional chains @xcite and in studies on nanotubes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study lattices with both fixed and free bcs although we think that fixed bcs are more realistic .    in the presence of an external pinning potential low frequency modes",
