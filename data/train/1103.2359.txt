    "in this letter we present accurate new results for the transport coefficients of the anderson model obtained by using the numerical renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "the anderson model has been used extensively to interpret the properties of magnetic impurities in simple metals , certain aspects of heavy fermion behaviour @xcite and the low  temperature transport through a quantum dot @xcite . recently",
    "this model has also become important for an understanding of the properties of correlated electrons on a lattice in high dimensions . the electron self  energy becomes local in infinite dimensions @xcite and the problem reduces to that of an impurity @xcite . in particular the solution of the @xmath4 hubbard model has been shown to reduce to the solution of an anderson impurity model with a hybridization function , @xmath5 , determined by a self  consistency requirement @xcite .",
    "the self  consistency condition is straightforward to handle and the difficult part of the problem has remained the calculation of the dynamics of the underlying impurity problem , and more specifically of the impurity single  particle spectral densities .",
    "this is just the problem which one encounters in attempting to calculate the transport coefficients of the anderson model which depend sensitively on the temperature and frequency dependence of the single  particle spectral densities @xmath6 .",
    "an accurate solution of this problem can therefore provide the solution of the @xmath4 hubbard model .",
    "our main interest , then , is the accurate solution of the anderson model and in particular the calculation of its single",
    " particle spectral densities .",
    "the bethe ansatz has been successful in providing exact results on the thermodynamic properties of several models of magnetic impurities including the n  fold degenerate anderson model @xcite , but the method can not be used to extract dynamic properties .",
    "the latter have been obtained by applying approximate methods . for",
    "@xmath7 perturbation theory in the local coulomb repulsion , u , has been used @xcite whilst for larger n ( typically @xmath8 ) the non  crossing approximation ( nca ) has been applied to calculate the thermodynamic , transport and dynamic properties @xcite .",
    "the former eventually becomes unreliable for large enough values of u ( typically for @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the resonance level width ) and the latter fails to satisfy some exact fermi liquid relations at low energies @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum monte carlo methods in combination with the maximum entropy principle have also been used to extract dynamic properties @xcite .",
    "these have so far been restricted to the symmetric model and to @xmath11 .",
    "they become more inaccurate and time consuming for larger values of u and lower temperatures .",
    "a comprehensive and highly accurate approach to the calculation of dynamic properties of magnetic impurity models has recently been developed , based on an extension of wilson s numerical renormalization group approach , which overcomes many of the limitations and difficulties of the other approximate schemes .",
    "this has led to reliable results valid in all regimes and at both zero @xcite and finite @xcite temperature , and which satisfy all the sum rules and fermi liquid relations of the anderson model @xcite . with such results for the dynamic properties it becomes possible to calculate the transport coefficients of the anderson model over the full temperature range of interest .",
    "we report here results for the resistivity , and thermopower based on these numerical renormalization group calculations .",
    "results for the hall coefficient and thermal conductivity have also been calculated and will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .    our starting point is the non  degenerate ( @xmath7 ) anderson model : @xmath12 this can be re  cast in the form of a linear chain model which may then be iteratively diagonalized .",
    "the lanczos algorithm is applied to @xmath13 with starting vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 so that the conduction electron part of @xmath16 is reduced to a semi ",
    "infinite linear chain with site @xmath17 coupled to the impurity via a hybridization term of strength v @xcite : @xmath18 the parameters @xmath19 reflect the form of the hybridization function @xmath20 . in the present case of the magnetic impurity problem",
    "we are primarily interested in low energies where @xmath5 may be taken to be a slowly varying function of @xmath21 which can be approximated by a constant @xmath10 . in this case , and by replacing the continuum of conduction electron states in @xmath22 by a discrete set @xmath23 , a discrete approximation to @xmath16 can be obtained with parameters @xmath24 @xcite ( the @xmath25 are zero for a half  filled symmetric band ) . for the impurity model corresponding to the @xmath4 hubbard model ,",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath5 is important and leads to a different set of parameters @xmath26 .",
    "the model has to be solved repeatedly in this case to obtain a self ",
    "consistent @xmath5 using the self  consistency requirement in @xcite .    the discretized anderson model with @xmath27 , discussed above , can be iteratively diagonalized to obtain the many  body eigenvalues @xmath28 and eigenstates @xmath29 on successively lower energy scales @xmath30 by following the procedure in @xcite . the procedure starts with diagonalizing the impurity part @xmath31 and then adding the coupling to the local conduction electron state @xmath32 .",
    "after this one adds successive energy shells @xmath33 and diagonalizes the resulting hamiltonian . since the number of states grows like @xmath34 it is in practice only possible to retain the lowest 500 or so states at each stage .",
    "this restricts the reliable range of excitations @xmath21 to be such that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the lower excitations are calculated more reliably in successive iterations , whilst information on the higher excitations is contained in previous iterations .",
    "the eigenvalues are used to calculate the partition function at a decreasing sequence of temperatures @xmath38 and from this one extracts the thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "from the eigenvectors @xmath29 we recursively evaluate the single  particle matrix elements @xmath39 which are required for the nth shell green s function @xmath40 and spectral density @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the partition function for the @xmath45 cluster or energy shell . in evaluating @xmath41 the delta functions",
    "are replaced by gaussians having widths @xmath46 of order @xmath47 appropriate to the cluster size . at @xmath48 the spectral density",
    "is evaluated at excitations @xmath49 using the @xmath45 cluster . at finite temperature @xmath50 , and when @xmath51 becomes of order @xmath52 excited states not contained in the @xmath45 cluster become important . in this case",
    "we use a smaller cluster ( containing information about the higher excited states ) to evaluate the spectral densities at energies @xmath21 such that @xmath53 .",
    "results for the spectral densities @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ figure1 ] and figure  [ figure2 ] for various temperatures .",
    "the friedel sum rule @xmath54 and shiba relation for the dynamic susceptibility @xcite are satisfied to within a few per cent in all parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "the calculation of transport properties is straightforward once accurate results for the temperature and frequency dependence of the spectral densities are obtained .",

    "electron green s function by latexmath:[$\\tau(\\omega , t)^{-1}=2\\pi    charge .",
    "there are two exact fermi liquid relations for the transport coefficients .",
    "the first is for the coefficient of the @xmath3 term in the low temperature resistivity @xcite . for @xmath2 and",
    "in the kondo regime we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 results for the resistivity are shown in figure  [ figure3 ] for @xmath66 and for several values of the local level position ranging from the kondo regime ( @xmath67 ) to the mixed valent regime ( @xmath68 ) and the empty orbital regime ( @xmath69 ) . for high temperatures",
    "@xmath0 , as described elsewhere @xcite , the resistivity is well described by the hamann result @xcite . in the fermi liquid regime",
    "@xmath2 the inset in figure  [ figure3 ] shows the expected @xmath70 behaviour . in the kondo regime the values of the @xmath70 coefficient extracted from a least squares fit in the region @xmath71 are @xmath72 and @xmath73 in going from the symmetric case to @xmath74 .",
    "these values agree to within 8% of the exact result @xmath75 .",
    "quantum monte carlo results for the symmetric case for @xmath76 give the @xmath70 coefficient to within 19% of the exact result @xcite .",
    "the current approach which is not restricted to very low or very high temperatures also gives accurate results for the resistivity in the cross  over region @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 resistivity @xmath78 satisfies @xmath79 in accordance with the friedel sum rule for the single  particle spectral density @xcite .     in the mixed valent regime @xmath80 for several values of the reduced temperature @xmath81 and for @xmath66 . note that @xmath10 is a more appropriate energy scale in this regime than @xmath64 .",

    "the inset is for @xmath100 versus @xmath101 and shows the linear in t fermi liquid behaviour for @xmath2 . ]",
    "( dashed line with diamonds ) and @xmath102 ( solid line ) versus @xmath103 for the various parameter sets ranging from kondo to mixed valent and empty orbital behaviour .",
    "the two curves lie within @xmath104 of each other in all cases , except for the empty orbital case @xmath69 where the error is 10% . ]",
    "a second fermi liquid relation relates the linear coefficient of the thermopower to the local level occupancy , @xmath105 , and the linear coefficient of specific heat , @xmath106 , @xcite @xmath107 this is a much more difficult fermi liquid relation to satisfy , because the local level occupancy @xmath108 is obtained by integrating the single  particle spectral density up to the fermi level , the linear coefficient of specific heat is obtained as a second derivative @xmath109 of the free energy and @xmath110 involves evaluating the transport integrals using the finite t spectral densities @xmath6 .",
    "all these quantities are evaluated using the numerical renormalization group method and the above relation provides a very severe test of the accuracy of the method .",
    "the thermopower is shown in figure  [ figure4 ] for the mixed valent , empty orbital and kondo regimes .",
    "the sign of the thermopower at low temperatures is determined by the sign of @xmath111 and is always positive for the range of parameters considered . at higher temperatures the behaviour of @xmath56 is more complicated",
    "however , in the mixed valent and empty orbital regimes the single resonance always lies above the fermi level ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ) , and from equation ( 7 ) the thermopower is positive at all temperatures . in the kondo regime",
    "a distinctive maximum appears in the thermopower at @xmath112 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the thermopower can become negative and for sufficiently high temperatures positive again .",
    "this bahaviour is associated with the temperature dependence of the satellite peaks at @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the low temperature behaviour of the thermopower ( inset to figure  [ figure4 ] ) shows the expected linear in @xmath115 fermi liquid behaviour and one can use this to extract @xmath116 . by calculating the linear coefficient of specific heat from the free energy and @xmath117 from the spectral densities we can test the fermi liquid relation ( 10 ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ figure5 ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath118 lies within @xmath104 of @xmath102 in nearly all cases .",
    "this agreement is remarkable and shows clearly that the method is capable of giving close to exact results for transport coefficients and finite temperature dynamic properties in addition to the @xmath48 dynamics and the thermodynamics .",
    "we have not made any of the sophisticated corrections @xcite to improve on the thermodynamics and only the even energy shell spectral densities have been utilized , hence there is scope for improvement .",
    "the characteristic peak at @xmath1 in the thermopower in the kondo regime is often referred to as the giant thermopower .",
    "this peak can become very large , although to see this one needs to keep @xmath119 fixed and approach the kondo regime by increasing u. in our calculations @xmath120 was varied to approach the symmetric case for which the thermopower is zero as can be seen by setting @xmath121 in equation ( 10 ) . from equation ( 10 ) it is clear that keeping @xmath119 fixed and increasing u leads to an exponential increase in the thermopower since @xmath122 thus giving a giant thermopower in the kondo limit .",
    "the vanishing of the thermopower for half  filling is an artifact of the simplified model used here which neglects the non  resonant scattering of conduction electrons as discussed in @xcite .",
    "an extension of the present calculations to include non  resonant scattering , leads to enhanced thermopowers for half  filled systems and describes the qualitative behaviour of the thermopower of concentrated kondo compounds @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have presented new results for the thermopower and resistivity of the anderson model over the full temperature range of interest and in several parameter regimes by using the numerical renormalization group approach .",
    "the fermi liquid relation for the linear coefficient of the thermopower is satisfied with remarkable accuracy , as is that for the @xmath70 coefficient of the resistivity . the hall coefficient , thermal conductivity and finite temperature dynamic susceptibilities have also been calculated and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our results are in contrast to nca calculations @xcite which violate fermi liquid relations at low energies , and to perturbation in u calculations which although accurate eventually break down for @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "we are able to treat a much wider range of regimes than the monte carlo approach @xcite which has so far only been applied to the symmetric case where the thermopower is zero and which often builds in the sum rules which constitute independent tests within our approach .",
    "the techniques presented here for extracting the spectral densities of the anderson model provide a new highly accurate approach to the @xmath4 hubbard model .",
