    "the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian has come to some prominence through the work of read and green @xcite who , through a mean - field analysis , exposed a change in the topological properties of the ground - state wavefunction of the hamiltonian as a function of the coupling parameter .",
    "an exact bethe ansatz solution of the hamiltonian was provided in @xcite , and shortly after two detailed analyses were conducted in @xcite .",
    "however their conclusions were different , with @xcite arguing that there are three ground - state phases of the system while @xcite maintained that there are two . in both cases",
    "the author s singled out the _ moore - read _ and _ read - green _ lines of the system , which will be defined later , as displaying some unique properties . in @xcite it was argued that both lines should be identified with quantum phase boundaries , whereas @xcite claimed that only the read - green line represented a quantum phase boundary .",
    "we consider a simplified hamiltonian for two interacting @xmath0 spins , which we present as an analogue of the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian in that it displays both the moore - read and read - green lines in the phase diagram as a result of a duality relation .",
    "we then conduct an analysis of the system using a mean - field approximation and the exact bethe ansatz solution to investigate ground - state properties in the thermodynamic limit , defined here as the limit of infinite spin ( or highest weight ) .",
    "an advantage of dealing with this hamiltonian of two interacting @xmath0 spins is that analytic results are accessible .",
    "we also numerically solve the system to study the ground - state energy gap , fidelity @xcite , and entanglement @xcite , which have been used as indicators of quantum phase transitions in other simple bipartite quantum systems e.g. @xcite .",
    "we find that certain ground - state properties in the thermodynamic limit are ill - defined , due to issues concerning non - commuting limits of the system s coupling parameters and the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we comment on some possible implications for the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian .",

    "we will study the following coupled - spin hamiltonian @xmath6 which acts on the @xmath7-dimensional tensor product space with basis @xmath8 throughout we assume @xmath9 . for given @xmath3 the model has three coupling parameters .",
    "one of these can be fixed by choosing the overall energy scale , e.g. setting @xmath10 , which leaves two independent parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "define @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15=0 $ ] . from the commutation relations ( [ cr ] ) the following equation can be shown to hold @xmath16 & = m q^+ ( b^+)^{m-1 }    ( 1+gm + 2gs^z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if a state @xmath17 has spin @xmath18 ( the eigenvalue of @xmath19 ) the above means that choosing @xmath20 , so @xmath21 , the two states @xmath17 and @xmath22 have the same energy",
    ". we call the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 _ dual _ states . since the state @xmath17 has spin @xmath18",
    "the state @xmath25 has spin @xmath26 .",
    "we identify the following cases :    * the dual of the lowest weight state @xmath27 occurs when @xmath28 leading to @xmath25 having spin @xmath29 .",
    "this is referred to as the moore - read line , on which the ground - state energy is zero . * if @xmath30 then a state is self - dual when @xmath31 .",
    "this is referred to as the read - green line .",
    "note that the above definitions for the moore - read and read - green lines are _ independent _ of the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath11 , analogous to the case of the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian where these lines are independent of the single particle momentum distribution @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) may be viewed as a degenerate , two - level limit of the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian on a restricted hilbert space , which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "our main objective is to investigate ground - state properties of the model in the _ thermodynamic limit _ which we define by a sequence of ordered triples @xmath33 such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 held constant . in terms of these parameters",
    "the moore - read line is given by @xmath36 while the read - green line is @xmath37 .",
    "the initial study by read and green @xcite on the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian was undertaken using a mean - field analysis .",
    "here we start by taking an analogous study for the coupled - spin model .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be approximated by a hamiltonian with linear terms through @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the expectation value of the operator @xmath40 .",
    "the mean - field approximation which linearises the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a lagrange multiplier ( the analogue of the chemical potential ) which is introduced as the mean - field approximation breaks the conservation of @xmath19 , and @xmath43 setting @xmath44 the ground state energy is found to be @xmath45    using the hellmann - feynman theorem we can determine the mean - field expectation values : @xmath46 taking the thermodynamic limit gives @xmath47 also @xmath48 taking the thermodynamic limit and using ( [ gap ] ) gives @xmath49 returning to the energy expression in the limit @xmath50 , and taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ gap],[chempot ] ) , we obtain the intensive energy expression @xmath51 it may be verified that setting @xmath52 in ( [ gap],[chempot ] ) and combining these equations leads to the equation of the moore - read line .",
    "furthermore , setting @xmath52 in ( [ mfnrg ] ) gives @xmath53 in agreement with the result that ground states on the moore - read line are dual to the lowest weight state .",
    "recalling the assumption @xmath54 the mimimum excitation energy ( i.e. the gap ) is @xmath55 which vanishes when @xmath56 .",
    "however turning to ( [ chempot ] ) we see that the limits @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not commute in that equation .",
    "first setting @xmath59 leads to the condition of the read - green line . alternatively first setting @xmath60 yields @xmath61 which shows a discontinuity as @xmath42 passes through zero .",
    "this indicates that while gapless excitations occur in the limit @xmath62 , where they are to be found in the phase diagram will depend on how these two limits are taken ( at least within the mean - field approximation ) .    in the analogous study of read and green @xcite , a similar type of discontinuity",
    "was also observed in a particular number operator expectation value . through this observation",
    "the read - green line was identified with a topological phase transition . for the simplified coupled - spin model we will next conduct an analysis using exact results . in this manner we will highlight some subtle aspects regarding the ground - state properties of the system , which appear to be beyond the scope of a mean - field analysis .",
    "here we set @xmath60 from the outset , and fix the energy scale by letting @xmath10 , in which case the hamiltonian is simply @xmath63 the above hamiltonian is diagonal in the basis ( [ basis ] ) with eigenvalues @xmath64 for each value of @xmath65 we can determine the ground state energy , and the gap , by considering where level crossings occur .",
    "we need to consider several different cases . starting with @xmath66",
    "we have @xmath67 in the thermodynamic limit it is seen that that for @xmath68 a first level crossing occurs at @xmath69 next consider @xmath70 here there is an energy gap @xmath71 in the thermodynamic limit the final level crossing occurs when @xmath72 which requires that @xmath73 .",
    "now we consider the case for @xmath74 : @xmath75 the gap @xmath76 goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit when @xmath77 this requires that @xmath78 in the region bounded by the equations ( [ b1],[b2],[b3 ] ) the level crossings become dense in the thermodynamic limit , giving rise to a gapless phase .",
    "the following relations hold for the gap between the ground and first - excited states in the regions depicted in the phase diagram of fig . 2 : @xmath79    there is clear discrepancy between figs . 1 and 2",
    ", in particular for the predicted gapless regions . in deriving the two phase diagrams we consider behaviours as @xmath80 with @xmath81 , and as @xmath57 , yielding phase boundary lines as functions of the coupling parameter @xmath82 .",
    "so far there are indications that the limiting behaviours do not always commute .",
    "similar issues with non - commuting limits have been observed in the different context of attractive bosons @xcite . in the following three subsections we will appeal to further exact results to gain a better insight into the properties of the system .      in the sector where @xmath83 the hilbert space is two - dimensional and exact results are easily extracted . in matrix form , with respect to the basis",

    "it is found that @xmath90 with the result being invariant with respect to interchanging the order of the limits .",
    "moreover , as @xmath91 the _ only _ solution for @xmath92 when @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 , meaning that gapless excitations _ do not _ occur at the read - green line in this limit @xmath88 .",
    "the behaviour accords with fig .",
    "2 rather than fig . 1 .    next",
    "consider @xmath95 we find @xmath96 this establishes that the non - commutativity of limits is not just an artefact of the mean - field approximation , but is an intrinsic property of the model .",
    "next we will use the duality properties of the model to show that non - analytic behaviour is found on the moore - read line appearing in fig .",
    "our approach is through a study of how the intensive ground - state energy @xmath97 varies with @xmath82 while @xmath98 and @xmath99 are held constant .",
    "first we consider two ground states of the system at different values of the coupling parameter : @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .",
    "we also have @xmath102 .",
    "it is found that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath103 so we hereafter set @xmath104 then @xmath105    the ground state corresponding to @xmath106 is on the moore - read line , and so has energy @xmath107 .",
    "the ground state corresponding to @xmath108 is dual to the ground state of ( [ 2dh ] ) , and so has energy @xmath109}$ ] as given by ( [ 2dnrg ] ) .",
    "we also have @xmath110 now consider in general terms @xmath111 one could alternatively define @xmath112 the definitions will be equivalent if the limits @xmath113 and @xmath91 commute .",
    "if the limits @xmath114 and @xmath91 commute we have @xmath115 where in the last step we use ( [ 2dnrg],[lim ] ) . alternatively @xmath116 so assuming that the limits @xmath50 and @xmath114 commute leads to the partial derivative being discontimuous .",
    "as in the case of the @xmath1 model @xcite , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) admits a bethe ansatz solution .",
    "the energy spectrum is given by @xmath117 where the @xmath118 , are roots of the bethe ansatz equations @xmath119 and the total spin is @xmath120 . for each solution of the bethe ansatz equations",
    "the associated eigenstate is @xmath121 where @xmath122 the validity of this solution can be verfied in a direct manner , using only the commutation relations ( [ cr ] ) .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "following @xcite , we look to solve the bethe ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit under the assumption that in this limit the roots of ( [ bae ] ) are densely distributed on a curve @xmath123 in the complex plane which is invariant under reflections about the real axis . introducing @xmath124 as the density function on @xmath123 for the roots , we divide ( [ bae ] ) by @xmath125 and take the limit @xmath126 to obtain @xmath127 where @xmath128 refers to the cauchy principal value for the integral . to solve the problem",
    "we define an analytic function @xmath129 outside @xmath123 such that @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the limiting values of @xmath129 to the right and left of @xmath123 . we can then rewrite ( [ lim ] ) as @xmath133 where @xmath134 encircles @xmath123 .",
    "next we take the following ansatz : @xmath135 \\label{hy}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 with @xmath137 denoting the end points of the arc @xmath123 . replacing ( [ hy ] ) in ( [ lim2 ] ) and evaluting",
    "the contour integral by residues leads to the conditions @xmath138 these combine to give @xmath139 we may also compute @xmath140    identifying @xmath141 and @xmath142 , eqs .",
    "( [ q],[m ] ) are precisely the mean - field equations ( [ chempot],[gap ] ) respectively .",
    "this would suggest that the mean - field equations should be exact in the thermodynamic limit as they are reproducible from the exact bethe ansatz solution .",
    "however , the above calculations assume that in the thermodynamic limit the roots of the bethe ansatz equations become dense on a curve @xmath123 .",
    "this assumption is not always valid .",
    "suppose that the curve @xmath123 closes such that the end points @xmath143 become real and equal .",
    "( [ q],[m ] ) reduce to @xmath144 if @xmath145 the only solution is @xmath146 , whereas if @xmath147 we obtain the equation of the moore - read line @xmath148 .",
    "but the ground - state roots on the moore - read line are all zero , as the ground state is dual to the lowest weight state . thus taking @xmath50 after @xmath114 leads to a delta function distribution of roots at the origin , while taking @xmath149 after @xmath50 leads to the roots being distributed on a closed curve enclosing the origin .",
    "the non - commutativity of these limits has previously been observed in the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian . in @xcite",
    "this was referred to as a zeroth order transition .",
    "we may identify the moore - read line as the boundary at which mean - field theory breaks down .",
    "in the region immediately beyond the moore - read line we can not assume that the ground - state roots of the bethe ansatz equations are densely distributed on a single curve , in order to produce the mean - field equations from the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "while there have been numerous studies of quantum phase transitions , there still lacks a definitive property which may be used to identify them . in the remaining subsections we study various methods to gain an insight into the nature of possible quantum phase transitions for this system . using numerical diagonalisation of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , below we compute the energy gap , fidelity , and entanglement ( as given by the von neumann entropy ) .",
    "each quantity is plotted as a function of the parameter @xmath150 .",
    "we fix @xmath151 , @xmath10 , and adopt the parameterisation @xmath152 such that @xmath57 as @xmath91 .",
    "we focus on this case as it permits us to compactly cover the regions ii , iii and iv in fig .",
    "2 .      in fig .",
    "[ gap ] we plot the energy gap .",
    "there are two different points of minima corresponding to the boundary lines between region iii and iv , and between region iv and ii , in fig .",
    "[ phasez ] .",
    "it is seen in the inset that as @xmath3 increases the energy gap decreases in region iv of fig .",
    "the results appear more consistent with fig .",
    "2 rather than fig .",
    "1 , as to be expected in view of the results from subsect . 4.2 .",
    "another means to investigate quantum phase transitions is using fidelity @xcite , a concept widely used in quantum information theory .",
    "the fidelity of two states is simply defined as the modulus of the inner product @xmath153 computing this quantity for ground - state vectors associated with hamiltonians differing only by a small change in the coupling parameter , the fidelity may be sensitive to variations of the coupling parameter .",
    "generally a minimum in the fidelity points to a rapid change in the ground - state properties , which may indicate a critical point of the system .    here",
    "we take two coupling values @xmath154 with @xmath155 to compute the fidelity of the ground states associated with @xmath156 , and then consider the behaviour of the fidelity as @xmath82 is varied . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fid ] , for values of the parameter @xmath150 above @xmath157 and values below @xmath158 , the fidelity is close to 1 , but suffers an abrupt change at these two points .",
    "the two points correspond to the boundary lines between regions ii and iv and regions iv and iii for @xmath151 in the phase diagram fig .",
    "[ phasez ] .",
    "also , it can be seen that the minimum of the fidelity is decreasing as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the coupled - spin model is naturally seen as a bipartite system . in this case",
    "we can use the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator to quantify the entanglement of the system @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the total spin @xmath18 is conserved , we can write a general state of the system ( for @xmath159 ) in terms of ( [ basis ] ) by @xmath160 for some complex numbers @xmath161 . the density operator for state ( [ gs ] )",
    "is given by @xmath162 we take the partial trace with respect to the spin sector @xmath163 yields the reduced density operator for the spin sector @xmath164 : @xmath165 the von neumann entropy of entanglement for the state is given by @xmath166=-\\sum_{j =- s}^{m+s}|d_j|^2\\log_2(|d_j|^2 ) .",
    "\\label{entg}\\ ] ] using the formula ( [ entg ] ) we compute the entanglement of the ground state with @xmath151 as function of @xmath150 , as shown in fig .",
    "we can identify two abrupt changes in the entanglement value about the points @xmath167 and @xmath168 in agreement with energy gap and fidelity analysis .",
    "note that the entanglement variation gets sharper as the value of @xmath3 is increased .",
    "the mean - field analysis of the model predicted the ground - state phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 displaying the moore - read line , where the ground - state energy is zero , and read - green line , on which the gap goes to zero as @xmath57 . these lines also appear naturally with regards to the duality described in sect . 2 and are _ independent _ of the variables @xmath32 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is exactly the same phase diagram as that found for the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however starting with a finite - size system , setting @xmath60 , and then taking the thermodynamic limit gave the ground - state phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "4 we turned to the exact bethe ansatz solution for the model and through it found features associated with both phase diagrams . in the limit @xmath88",
    "the gap was minimised at @xmath169 as @xmath57 , in agreement with fig .",
    "2 . upon further analysis",
    "we also saw that the limits @xmath50 and @xmath57 do not always commute , with the derivative of the energy gap being ill - defined in this limit as @xmath170 . on the other hand the moore - read line of fig . 1 was found to exhibit non - analytic behaviour if the limits @xmath50 and @xmath114 were assumed to be commutative . using the exact bethe ansatz solution we argued that the moore - read line signifies the breakdown of the validity of mean - field solution .",
    "finally we numerically studied the gap , fidelity , and entanglement to illustrate that signatures of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "2 were found in these quantities .",
    "the complexity observed here in the simplified coupled - spin model highlights the need for deeper investigations into characterising the phase diagram of the @xmath1-pairing hamiltonian , in a manner which fully takes into account the peculiarities presented by the non - commuting limits .",
    "we expect that this is particularly the case in the so - called _ weak - pairing _ phase , which lies between the moore - read and read - green lines .",
    "it is in this region that the ground - state roots of the bethe ansatz equations can not be uniquely described by a density function , with support on a connected curve @xmath123 , which varies smoothly with @xmath82 . in this region there",
    "are limiting root distributions which have delta function terms at the origin , as a result of the duality , that are not connected to the distribution of the remaining roots .",
