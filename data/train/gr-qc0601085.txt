    "this is usually relevant when curvature , or in physical terms energy densities and tidal forces , becomes large . in cosmology",
    "this is the case close to the big bang , and also in the interior of black holes .",
    "we are thus able to learn about gravity on small scales by looking at the early history of the universe .    starting with general relativity on large scales and evolving backward in time , the universe becomes smaller and smaller and quantum effects eventually become important . that the classical theory by itself can not be sufficient to describe the history in a well - defined way is illustrated by singularity theorems @xcite which also apply in this case : after a finite time of backward evolution the classical universe will collapse into a single point and energy densities diverge . at this point",
    ", the theory breaks down and can not be used to determine what is happening there . quantum gravity , with its different dynamics on small scales ,",
    "is expected to solve this problem .",
    "the quantum description does not only present a modified dynamical behavior on small scales but also a new conceptual setting . rather than dealing with a classical space - time manifold",
    ", we now have evolution equations for the wave function of a universe .",
    "this opens a vast number of problems on various levels from mathematical physics to cosmological observations , and even philosophy .",
    "this review is intended to give an overview and summary of the current status of those problems , in particular in the new framework of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "loop quantum cosmology is based on quantum riemannian geometry , or loop quantum gravity @xcite , which is an attempt at a non - perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity .",
    "this means that no assumptions of small fields or the presence of a classical background metric are made , both of which is expected to be essential close to classical singularities where the gravitational field would diverge and space degenerates .",
    "in contrast to other approaches to quantum cosmology there is a direct link between cosmological models and the full theory @xcite , as we will describe later in sec .",
    "[ s : link ] . with cosmological applications we are thus able to test several possible constructions and draw conclusions for open issues in the full theory .",
    "at the same time , of course , we can learn about physical effects which have to be expected from properties of the quantization and can potentially lead to observable predictions . since the full theory is not completed yet , however , an important issue in this context is the robustness of those applications to choices in the full theory and quantization ambiguities .",
    "the full theory itself is , understandably , extremely complex and thus requires approximation schemes for direct applications .",
    "loop quantum cosmology is based on symmetry reduction , in the simplest case to isotropic geometries @xcite .",
    "this poses the mathematical problem as to how the quantum representation of a model and its composite operators can be derived from that of the full theory , and in which sense this can be regarded as an approximation with suitable correction terms .",
    "research in this direction currently proceeds by studying symmetric models with less symmetries and the relations between them .",
    "this allows to see what role anisotropies and inhomogeneities play in the full theory .    while this work is still in progress",
    ", one can obtain full quantizations of models by using basic features as they can already be derived from the full theory together with constructions of more complicated operators in a way analogous to what one does in the full theory ( see sec .",
    "[ s : analog ] ) . for those complicated operators , the prime example being the hamiltonian constraint which dictates the dynamics of the theory ,",
    "the link between model and the full theory is not always clear - cut .",
    "nevertheless , one can try different versions in the model in explicit ways and see what implications this has , so again the robustness issue arises .",
    "this has already been applied to issues such as the semiclassical limit and general properties of quantum dynamics .",
    "thus , general ideas which are required for this new , background independent quantization scheme , can be tried in a rather simple context in explicit ways to see how those constructions work in practice .    at the same time , there are possible phenomenological consequences in the physical systems being studied , which is the subject of sec .",
    "[ s : effective ] .",
    "in fact , it turned out , rather surprisingly , that already very basic effects such as the discreteness of quantum geometry and other features briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ s : lqg ] , for which a reliable derivation from the full theory is available , have very specific implications in early universe cosmology . while quantitative aspects depend on quantization ambiguities , there is a rich source of qualitative effects which work together in a well - defined and viable picture of the early universe .",
    "in such a way , as illustrated later , a partial view of the full theory and its properties emerges also from a physical , not just mathematical perspective .    with this wide range of problems",
    "being investigated we can keep our eyes open to input from all sides .",
    "there are mathematical consistency conditions in the full theory , some of which are identically satisfied in the simplest models ( such as the isotropic model which has only one hamiltonian constraint and thus a trivial constraint algebra ) .",
    "they are being studied in different , more complicated models and also in the full theory directly",
    ". since the conditions are not easy to satisfy , they put stringent bounds on possible ambiguities . from physical applications , on the other hand , we obtain conceptual and phenomenological constraints which can be complementary to those obtained from consistency checks .",
    "all this contributes to a test and better understanding of the background independent framework and its implications .",
    "other reviews of loop quantum cosmology at different levels can be found in @xcite .",
    "for complementary applications of loop quantum gravity to cosmology see @xcite .",
    "since many reviews of full loop quantum gravity @xcite as well as shorter accounts @xcite are already available , we describe here only those properties which will be essential later on .",
    "nevertheless , this review is mostly self - contained ; our notation is closest to that in @xcite .",
    "a recent bibliography can be found at @xcite .",
    "general relativity in its canonical formulation @xcite describes the geometry of space - time in terms of fields on spatial slices .",
    "geometry on such a spatial slice @xmath0 is encoded in the spatial metric @xmath1 , which presents the configuration variables .",
    "canonical momenta are given in terms of extrinsic curvature @xmath2 which is the derivative of the spatial metric under changing the spatial slice .",
    "those fields are not arbitrary since they are obtained from a solution of einstein s equations by choosing a time coordinate defining the spatial slices , and space - time geometry is generally covariant . in the canonical formalism",
    "this is expressed by the presence of constraints on the fields , the diffeomorphism constraint and the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the diffeomorphism constraint generates deformations of a spatial slice or coordinate changes , and when it is satisfied spatial geometry does not depend on which coordinates we choose on space .",
    "general covariance of space - time geometry also for the time coordinate is then completed by imposing the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this constraint , furthermore , is important for the dynamics of the theory : since there is no absolute time , there is no hamiltonian generating evolution , but only the hamiltonian constraint . when it is satisfied , it encodes correlations between the physical fields of gravity and matter such that evolution in this framework is relational .",
    "the reproduction of a space - time metric in a coordinate dependent way then requires to choose a gauge and to compute the transformation in gauge parameters ( including the coordinates ) generated by the constraints .",
    "it is often useful to describe spatial geometry not by the spatial metric but by a triad @xmath3 which defines three vector fields which are orthogonal to each other and normalized in each point .",
    "this yields all information about spatial geometry , and indeed the inverse metric is obtained from the triad by @xmath4 where we sum over the index @xmath5 counting the triad vector fields .",
    "there are differences , however , between metric and triad formulations .",
    "first , the set of triad vectors can be rotated without changing the metric , which implies an additional gauge freedom with group so(3 ) acting on the index @xmath5 .",
    "invariance of the theory under those rotations is then guaranteed by a gauss constraint in addition to the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints .",
    "the second difference will turn out to be more important later on : we can not only rotate the triad vectors but also reflect them , i.e.   change the orientation of the triad given by @xmath6 . this does not change the metric either , and so could be included in the gauge group as o(3 ) .",
    "however , reflections are not connected to the unit element of o(3 ) and thus are not generated by a constraint .",
    "it then has to be seen whether or not the theory allows to impose invariance under reflections , i.e.  if its solutions are reflection symmetric .",
    "this is not usually an issue in the classical theory since positive and negative orientations on the space of triads are separated by degenerate configurations where the determinant of the metric vanishes .",
    "points on the boundary are usually singularities where the classical evolution breaks down such that we will never connect between both sides . however , since there are expectations that quantum gravity may resolve classical singularities , which indeed are confirmed in loop quantum cosmology , we will have to keep this issue in mind and not restrict to only one orientation from the outset .      to quantize a constrained canonical theory one can use dirac s prescription @xcite and",
    "first represent the classical poisson algebra of a suitable complete set of basic variables on phase space as an operator algebra on a hilbert space , called kinematical .",
    "this ignores the constraints , which can be written as operators on the same hilbert space . at the quantum level",
    "the constraints are then solved by determining their kernel , to be equipped with an inner product so as to define the physical hilbert space .",
    "if zero is in the discrete part of the spectrum of a constraint , as e.g.   for the gauss constraint when the structure group is compact , the kernel is a subspace of the kinematical hilbert space to which the kinematical inner product can be restricted .",
    "if , on the other hand , zero lies in the continuous part of the spectrum , there are no normalizable eigenstates and one has to construct a new physical hilbert space from distributions .",
    "this is the case for the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints .    to perform the first step we need a hilbert space of functionals @xmath7 $ ] of spatial metrics",
    "unfortunately , the space of metrics , or alternatively extrinsic curvature tensors , is mathematically poorly understood and not much is known about suitable inner products . at this point , a new set of variables introduced by ashtekar @xcite becomes essential .",
    "this is a triad formulation , but uses the triad in a densitized form ( i.e.  it is multiplied with an additional factor of a jacobian under coordinate transformations ) .",
    "the densitized triad @xmath8 is then related to the triad by @xmath9 but has the same properties concerning gauge rotations and its orientation ( note the absolute value which is often omitted ) .",
    "the densitized triad is conjugate to extrinsic curvature coefficients @xmath10 : @xmath11 with the gravitational constant @xmath12 .",
    "extrinsic curvature is then replaced by the ashtekar connection @xmath13 with a positive value for @xmath14 , the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xcite .",
    "classically , this number can be changed by a canonical transformation of the fields , but it will play a more important and fundamental role upon quantization .",
    "the ashtekar connection is defined in such a way that it is conjugate to the triad , @xmath15 and obtains its transformation properties as a connection from the spin connection @xmath16}^k+   { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2 } } e_k^ce_a^l\\partial_{[c}e_{b]}^l)\\,.\\ ] ]    spatial geometry is then obtained directly from the densitized triad , which is related to the spatial metric by @xmath17 there is more freedom in a triad since it can be rotated without changing the metric .",
    "the theory is independent of such rotations provided the gauss constraint @xmath18=\\frac{1}{8\\pi\\gamma g}\\int_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{d}^3x \\lambda^id_ae^a_i=   \\frac{1}{8\\pi\\gamma g } \\int_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{d}^3x\\lambda^i(\\partial_ae^a_i+   \\epsilon_{ijk}a^j_ae^a_k)\\approx 0\\ ] ] is satisfied .",
    "independence from any spatial coordinate system or background is implemented by the diffeomorphism constraint ( modulo gauss constraint ) @xmath19=",
    "\\frac{1}{8\\pi\\gamma g}\\int_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{d}^3x   n^af_{ab}^ie_i^b \\approx 0\\ ] ] with the curvature @xmath20 of the ashtekar connection . in this",
    "setting , one can then discuss spatial geometry and its quantization .",
    "space - time geometry , however , is more complicated to deduce since it requires a good knowledge of the dynamics . in a canonical",
    "setting , dynamics is implemented by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath21=\\frac{1}{16\\pi\\gamma g } \\int_{\\sigma } \\mathrm{d}^3x n\\left|\\det     e\\right|^{-1/2 }   \\left(\\epsilon_{ijk}f_{ab}^ie^a_je^b_k -2(1+\\gamma^2 )   k^i_{[a}k^j_{b]}e^a_ie^b_j\\right)\\approx 0\\ ] ] where extrinsic curvature components have to be understood as functions of the ashtekar connection and the densitized triad through the spin connection .",
    "the key new aspect is now that we can choose the space of ashtekar connections as our configuration space whose structure is much better understood than that of a space of metrics .",
    "moreover , the formulation lends itself easily to a background independent quantization . to see this we need to remember that quantizing field theories requires one to smear fields , i.e.  to integrate them over regions in order to obtain a well - defined algebra without @xmath22-functions as in ( [ symp ] ) .",
    "usually this is done by integrating both configuration and momentum variables over three - dimensional regions , which requires an integration measure .",
    "this is no problem in ordinary field theories which are formulated on a background such as minkowski or a curved space .",
    "however , doing this here for gravity in terms of ashtekar variables would immediately spoil any possible background independence since a background would already occur at this very basic step .",
    "there is now a different smearing available which does not require a background metric .",
    "instead of using three - dimensional regions we integrate the connection along one - dimensional curves @xmath23 and exponentiate in a path - ordered manner , resulting in holonomies @xmath24 with tangent vector @xmath25 to the curve @xmath23 and @xmath26 in terms of pauli matrices .",
    "the path ordered exponentiation needs to be done in order to obtain a covariant object from the non - abelian connection .",
    "the prevalence of holonomies or , in their most simple gauge invariant form as wilson loops @xmath27 for closed @xmath23 , is the origin of loop quantum gravity and its name @xcite .",
    "similarly , densitized vector fields can naturally be integrated over 2-dimensional surfaces , resulting in fluxes @xmath28 with the co - normal @xmath29 to the surface .",
    "the poisson algebra of holonomies and fluxes is now well - defined and one can look for representations on a hilbert space .",
    "we also require diffeomorphism invariance , i.e.  there must be a unitary action of the diffeomorphism group on the representation by moving edges and surfaces in space .",
    "this is required since the diffeomorphism constraint has to be imposed later . under this condition",
    ", there is even a unique representation which defines the kinematical hilbert space @xcite .",
    "we can construct the hilbert space in the representation where states are functionals of connections .",
    "this can easily be done by using holonomies as `` creation operators '' starting with a `` ground state '' which does not depend on connections at all .",
    "multiplying with holonomies then generates states which do depend on connections but only along the edges used in the process .",
    "these edges can be collected in a graph appearing as a label of the state .",
    "an independent set of states is given by spin network states @xcite associated with graphs whose edges are labeled by irreducible representations of the gauge group su(2 ) in which to evaluate the edge holonomies , and whose vertices are labeled by matrices specifying how holonomies leaving or entering the vertex are multiplied together . the inner product on this state space is such that these states , with an appropriate definition of independent contraction matrices in vertices , are orthonormal .    spatial geometry can be obtained from fluxes representing the densitized triad .",
    "since these are now momenta , they are represented by derivative operators with respect to values of connections on the flux surface .",
    "states as constructed above depend on the connection only along edges of graphs such that the flux operator is non - zero only if there are intersection points between its surface and the graph in the state it acts on @xcite .",
    "moreover , the contribution from each intersection point can be seen to be analogous to an angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics which has a discrete spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus , when acting on a given state we obtain a finite sum of discrete contributions and thus a discrete spectrum of flux operators .",
    "the spectrum depends on the value of the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter , which can accordingly be fixed using implications of the spectrum such as black hole entropy which gives a value of the order of but smaller than one @xcite .",
    "moreover , since angular momentum operators do not commute , flux operators do not commute in general @xcite .",
    "there is thus no triad representation which is another reason why using a metric formulation and trying to build its quantization with functionals on a metric space is difficult .",
    "there are important basic properties of this representation which we will use later on .",
    "first , as already noted , flux operators have discrete spectra and , secondly , holonomies of connections are well - defined operators .",
    "it is , however , not possible to obtain operators for connection components or their integrations directly but only in the exponentiated form .",
    "these are direct consequences of the background independent quantization and translate to particular properties of more complicated operators .",
    "a connection 1-form @xmath30 can be reconstructed uniquely if all its holonomies are known @xcite .",
    "it is thus sufficient to parameterize the configuration space by matrix elements of @xmath31 for all edges in space .",
    "this defines an algebra of functions on the infinite dimensional space of connections @xmath32 , which are multiplied as @xmath33-valued functions .",
    "moreover , there is a duality operation by complex conjugation , and if the structure group @xmath12 is compact a supremum norm exists since matrix elements of holonomies are then bounded .",
    "thus , matrix elements form an abelian @xmath34-algebra with unit as a subalgebra of all continuous functions on @xmath32 .",
    "any abelian @xmath34-algebra with unit can be represented as the algebra of _ all _ continuous functions on a compact space @xmath35 .",
    "the intuitive idea is that the original space @xmath32 , which has many more continuous functions , is enlarged by adding new points to it .",
    "this increases the number of continuity conditions and thus shrinks the set of continuous functions .",
    "this is done until only matrix elements of holonomies survive when continuity is imposed , and it follows from general results that the enlarged space must be compact for an abelian unital @xmath34-algebra .",
    "we thus obtain a compactification @xmath35 , the space of generalized connections @xcite , which densely contains the space @xmath32 .",
    "there is a natural diffeomorphism invariant measure @xmath36 on @xmath35 , the ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski measure @xcite , which defines the hilbert space @xmath37 of square integrable functions on the space of generalized connections . a dense subset @xmath38 of functions is given by cylindrical functions @xmath39 which depend on the connection through a finite but arbitrary number of holonomies .",
    "they are associated with graphs @xmath40 formed by the edges @xmath41 ,  , @xmath42 .",
    "for functions cylindrical with respect to two identical graphs the inner product can be written as @xmath43 with the haar measure @xmath44 on @xmath12 .",
    "the importance of generalized connections can be seen from the fact that the space @xmath32 of smooth connections is a subset of measure zero in @xmath35 @xcite .    with the dense subset @xmath38 of @xmath45",
    "we obtain the gelfand triple @xmath46 with the dual @xmath47 of linear functionals from @xmath38 to the set of complex numbers .",
    "elements of @xmath47 are distributions , and there is no inner product on the full space .",
    "however , one can define inner products on certain subspaces defined by the physical context . often , those subspaces appear when constraints with continuous spectra are solved following the dirac procedure .",
    "other examples include the definition of semiclassical or , as we will use in sec .",
    "[ s : link ] , symmetric states .      from the basic operators we can construct more complicated ones which , with growing degree of complexity , will be more and more ambiguous for instance from factor ordering choices .",
    "quite simple expressions exist for the area and volume operator @xcite which are constructed solely from fluxes .",
    "thus , they are less ambiguous since no factor ordering issues with holonomies arise .",
    "this is true because the area of a surface and volume of a region can be written classically as functionals of the densitized triad alone , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . at the quantum level",
    ", this implies that , just as fluxes , also area and volume have discrete spectra showing that spatial quantum geometry is discrete .",
    "( for discrete approaches to quantum gravity in general see @xcite . )",
    "all area eigenvalues are known explicitly , but this is not possible even in principle for the volume operator .",
    "nevertheless , some closed formulas and numerical techniques exist @xcite .",
    "the length of a curve , on the other hand , requires the co - triad which is an inverse of the densitized triad and is more problematic . since fluxes have discrete spectra containing zero , they do not have densely defined inverse operators . as we will describe below , it is possible to quantize those expressions but requires one to use holonomies .",
    "thus , here we encounter more ambiguities from factor ordering .",
    "still , one can show that also length operators have discrete spectra @xcite .",
    "inverse densitized triad components also arise when we try to quantize matter hamiltonians such as @xmath50 for a scalar field @xmath51 with momentum @xmath52 and potential @xmath53 ( not to be confused with volume ) .",
    "the inverse determinant again can not be quantized directly by using , e.g. , an inverse of the volume operator which does not exist .",
    "this seems , at first , to be a severe problem not unlike the situation in quantum field theory on a background where matter hamiltonians are divergent . yet",
    ", it turns out that quantum geometry allows one to quantize these expressions in a well - defined manner @xcite .",
    "to do this we notice that the poisson bracket of the volume with connection components , @xmath54 amounts to an inverse of densitized triad components and does allow a well - defined quantization : we can express the connection component through holonomies , use the volume operator and turn the poisson bracket into a commutator . since all operators involved have a dense intersection of their domains of definition , the resulting operator is densely defined and amounts to a quantization of inverse powers of the densitized triad .",
    "this also shows that connection components or holonomies are required in this process , and thus ambiguities can arise even if initially one starts with an expression such as @xmath55 which only depends on the triad .",
    "there are also many different ways to rewrite expressions as above , which all are equivalent classically but result in different quantizations . in classical regimes",
    "this would not be relevant , but can have sizeable effects at small scales .",
    "in fact , this particular aspect , which as a general mechanism is a direct consequence of the background independent quantization with its discrete fluxes , implies characteristic modifications of the classical expressions on small scales . we will discuss this and more detailed examples in the cosmological context in sec .",
    "[ s : effective ] .      similarly to matter hamiltonians one can also quantize the hamiltonian constraint in a well - defined manner @xcite .",
    "again , this requires to rewrite triad components and to make other regularization choices .",
    "thus , there is not just one quantization but a class of different possibilities .",
    "it is more direct to quantize the first part of the constraint containing only the ashtekar curvature .",
    "( this part agrees with the constraint in euclidean signature and barbero  immirzi parameter @xmath56 , and so is sometimes called euclidean part of the constraint . ) triad components and their inverse determinant are again expressed as a poisson bracket using the identity ( [ ident ] ) , and curvature components are obtained through a holonomy around a small loop @xmath57 of coordinate size @xmath58 and with tangent vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 at its base point @xcite : @xmath61 putting this together , an expression for the euclidean part @xmath62 $ ] can then be constructed in the schematic form @xmath63\\propto \\sum_vn(v)\\epsilon^{ijk}\\mathrm{tr}\\left (     h_{\\alpha_{ij}}h_{s_k}\\{h_{s_k}^{-1},v\\}\\right)+o(\\delta)\\ ] ] where one sums over all vertices of a triangulation of space whose tetrahedra are used to define closed curves @xmath64 and transversal edges @xmath65 .",
    "an important property of this construction is that coordinate functions such as @xmath58 disappear from the leading term , such that the coordinate size of the discretization is irrelevant .",
    "nevertheless , there are several choices to be made , such as how a discretization is chosen in relation to a graph the constructed operator is supposed to act on , which in later steps will have to be constrained by studying properties of the quantization .",
    "of particular interest is the holonomy @xmath66 since it creates new edges to a graph , or at least new spin on existing ones .",
    "its precise behavior is expected to have a strong influence on the resulting dynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are factor ordering choices , i.e.  whether triad components appear to the right or left of curvature components .",
    "it turns out that the expression above leads to a well - defined operator only in the first case , which in particular requires an operator non - symmetric in the kinematical inner product .",
    "nevertheless , one can always take that operator and add its adjoint ( which in this full setting does not simply amount to reversing the order of the curvature and triad expressions ) to obtain a symmetric version , such that the choice still exists .",
    "another choice is the representation chosen to take the trace , which for the construction is not required to be the fundamental one @xcite .",
    "the second part of the constraint is more complicated since one has to use the function @xmath67 in @xmath68 .",
    "as also developed in @xcite , extrinsic curvature can be obtained through the already constructed euclidean part via @xmath69 .",
    "the result , however , is rather complicated , and in models one often uses a more direct way exploiting the fact that @xmath70 has a more special form . in this way",
    ", additional commutators in the general construction can be avoided , which usually does not have strong effects . sometimes , however",
    ", these additional commutators can be relevant , which can always be decided by a direct comparison of different constructions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for an anomaly - free quantization the constraint operators have to satisfy an algebra mimicking the classical one .",
    "there are arguments that this is the case for the quantization as described above when each loop @xmath57 contains exactly one vertex of a given graph @xcite , but the issue is still open .",
    "moreover , the operators are quite complicated and it is not easy to see if they have the correct expectation values in appropriately defined semiclassical states .    even if one regards the quantization and semiclassical issues as satisfactory , one has to face several hurdles in evaluating the theory .",
    "there are interpretational issues of the wave function obtained as a solution to the constraints , and also the problem of time or observables emerges @xcite .",
    "there is a wild mixture of conceptual and technical problems at different levels , not the least because the operators are quite complicated .",
    "for instance , as seen in the rewriting procedure above , the volume operator plays an important role even if one is not necessarily interested in the volume of regions .",
    "since this operator is complicated , without an explicitly known spectrum , it translates to complicated matrix elements of the constraints and matter hamiltonians .",
    "loop quantum gravity should thus be considered as a framework rather than a uniquely defined theory , which however has important rigid aspects .",
    "this includes the basic representation of the holonomy - flux algebra and its general consequences .",
    "all this should not come as a surprise since even classical gravity , at this level of generality , is complicated enough .",
    "most solutions and results in general relativity are obtained with approximations or assumptions , one of the most widely used being symmetry reduction .",
    "in fact , this allows access to the most interesting gravitational phenomena such as cosmological expansion , black holes and gravitational waves .",
    "similarly , symmetry reduction is expected to simplify many problems of full quantum gravity by resulting in simpler operators and by isolating conceptual problems such that not all of them need to be considered at once .",

    "both concepts are independent and appear very differently . while the embedding of an edge , including its parameter length , is removed by diffeomorphism invariance , the spin label remains well - defined and is important for ambiguities of operators . in the model , however , the full diffeomorphism invariance is not available such that some information about edges remains in the theory and merges with the spin label .",

    "dynamics is controlled by the hamiltonian constraint , which classically gives the friedmann equation .",

    "in particular models with non - zero intrinsic curvature on their symmetry orbits , such as the closed isotropic model , can then be included in the construction .",
    "one issue to keep in mind is the fact that `` holonomies '' are treated differently in models and the full theory . in the latter case",

    "in such a case , connection components are approximated only when they are small ; if they are not , the corresponding objects such as the hamiltonian constraint receive infinitely many correction terms of higher powers in curvature ( similarly to effective actions ) . the difference between both ways of dealing with holonomies",

    "one can directly use the exponentials @xmath288 in ( [ isohol ] ) , viewed as 3-dimensional holonomies along integral curves , and mimic the full constraint where one follows a loop to get curvature components of the connection @xmath30 .",
    "respecting the symmetry , this can be done in the model with a square loop in two independent directions @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",

    "the constraint equation thus takes the form of a difference equation @xcite @xmath300 for the wave function @xmath298 which can be viewed as an evolution equation in internal time @xmath254 .",

    "all these choices also appear in the full theory such that one can draw conclusions for preferred cases there .    when the symmetry group is not abelian and there is non - zero intrinsic curvature , the construction is more complicated . for non - abelian symmetry groups",
    "integral curves as before do not form a closed loop and one needs a correction term related to intrinsic curvature components @xcite . moreover , the classical regime is not as straightforward to specify since connection components are not necessarily small when there is intrinsic curvature . a general scheme encompassing intrinsic curvature , other symmetric models and the full theory will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : gencons ] .      when replacing @xmath285 by holonomies we have modified the constraint as a function on the classical phase space .",
    "this is necessary since otherwise the function can not be quantized , but is different from the quantization of densities because now the replacements are not equivalent to the original constraint classically .",

    "this situation is different from the full theory , again related to the presence of a partial background @xcite .",
    "there , the parameter length of edges used to construct appropriate loops is irrelevant and thus can shrink to zero . in the model , however ,",
    "changing the edge length with respect to the background does change the operator and the limit does not exist . intuitively , this can be understood as follows : the full constraint operator ( [ fullh ] ) is a vertex sum obtained after introducing a discretization of space used to choose loops @xmath64 .",
    "this classical regularization sums over all tetrahedra in the discretization , whose number diverges in the limit where the discretization size shrinks to zero . in the quantization ,",
    "however , almost all these contributions vanish since a tetrahedron must contain a vertex of a state in order to contribute non - trivially .",
    "the result is independent of the discretization size once it is fine enough , and the limit can thus be taken trivially .    in a homogeneous model ,",
    "on the other hand , contributions from different tetrahedra of the triangulation must be identical owing to homogeneity .",
    "the coordinate size of tetrahedra drops out of the construction in the full background independent quantization , as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ s : ham ] , which is part of the reason for the discretization independence . in a homogeneous configuration",
    "the number of contributions thus increases in the limit , but their size does not change .",
    "this results in an ill - defined limit as we have already seen within the model itself .",
    "the difference between models and the full theory is thus only a consequence of the symmetry and not of different approaches .",
    "this will also become clear later in inhomogeneous models where one obtains a mixture between the two situations .",
    "moreover , in the full theory one has a situation similar to symmetric models if one does not only look at the operator limit when the regularization is removed but also checks the classical limit on semiclassical states . in homogeneous models ,",
    "the expression in terms of holonomies implies corrections to the classical constraint when curvature becomes larger .",
    "this is in analogy to other quantum field theories where effective actions generally have higher curvature terms . in the full theory ,",
    "those correction terms can be seen when one computes expectation values of the hamiltonian constraint in semiclassical states peaked at classical configurations for the connection and triad . when this classical configuration becomes small in volume or large in curvature , correction terms to the classical constraint arise . in this case",
    ", the semiclassical state provides the background with respect to which these corrections appear . in a homogeneous model",

    "[ [ wkb - approximation ] ] wkb approximation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are different procedures to make contact between the difference equation and classical constraints .",

    "dewitt representation becomes ill - defined .",
    "one can evade this by performing the continuum and semiclassical limit together .",
    "this again leads to corrections in terms of @xmath14 as well as @xmath311 which are mainly of the following form @xcite : matter hamiltonians receive corrections through the modified density @xmath195 , and there are similar terms in the gravitational part containing @xmath221 .",
    "these are purely from triad coefficients , and similarly connection components lead to higher order corrections as well as additional contributions summarized in a quantum geometry potential .",
    "a possible interpretation of this potential in analogy to the casimir effect has been put forward in @xcite .",
    "a related procedure to extract semiclassical properties from the difference operator , based on the bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics , has been discussed in @xcite .",

    "an alternative approach makes use of a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite which not only provides a geometrical picture of the classical limit but also a clear - cut procedure for computing effective hamiltonians in analogy to effective actions @xcite .    instead of using linear operators on a hilbert space one can formulate quantum mechanics on an infinite - dimensional phase space",
    "this space is directly obtained from the hilbert space where the inner product defines a metric as well as symplectic form on its linear vector space ( which in this way even becomes khler ) .",
    "this formulation brings quantum mechanics conceptually much closer to classical physics which also facilitates a comparison in a semiclassical analysis .",
    "we thus obtain a quantum phase space with infinitely many degrees of freedom , together with a flow defined by the schrdinger equation .",

    "can be done by coherent states which are preserved by the quantum evolution .",
    "this means that the quantum flow is tangential to the embedding of the classical phase space such that it agrees with the classical flow .",
    "the harmonic oscillator thus does not receive quantum corrections as is well known from effective actions for free field theories .",
    "other systems , however , behave in a more complicated manner where in general states spread .",
    "this means that additional coordinates of the quantum phase space are dynamical and may become excited .",
    "if this is the case , the quantum flow differs from the classical flow and an effective hamiltonian arises with correction terms which can be computed systematically .",
    "this effective hamiltonian is given by the expectation value @xmath315 in approximate coherent states @xcite .",
    "in these calculations one can include higher degrees of freedom along the fibers which , through the effective equations of motion , can be related to higher derivatives or higher curvature in the case of gravity .    for a constrained system , such as gravity",

    "since many dynamical issues in different models appear in a similar fashion , we discuss them in this section with a common background .",
    "the main feature is that dynamics is formulated by a difference equation which by itself , compared to the usual appearance of differential equations , implies new properties of evolution .",
    "depending on the model there are different classes , which even within a given model are subject to quantization choices . yet , since there is a common construction procedure many characteristic features are very general .",
    "classically , curvature encodes the dynamics of geometry and does so in quantum gravity , too . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum geometry is most intuitively understood in eigenstates of geometry , e.g.  a triad representation if it exists , in which curvature is unsharp .",
    "anyway , only solutions to the hamiltonian constraint are relevant which in general are peaked neither on spatial geometry nor on extrinsic curvature .",
    "the role of curvature thus has a different , less direct meaning in quantum gravity .",
    "still , it is instructive to quantize classical expressions for curvature in special situations , such as @xmath399 in isotropy . since the resulting operator is bounded , it has played an influential role on the development of statements regarding the fate of classical singularities",
    ".    however , one has to keep in mind that isotropy is a very special case , as emphasized before , and already anisotropic models shed quite a different light on curvature quantities .",
    "isotropy is special because there is only one classical spatial length scale given by the scale factor @xmath71 , such that intrinsic curvature can only be a negative power such as @xmath399 just for dimensional reasons . that the modification is not obvious by quantization in the model is illustrated by comparing the intrinsic curvature term @xmath219 , which remains unmodified and thus unbounded in the purely isotropic quantization , with the term coming from a matter hamiltonian where the classical divergence of @xmath400 is cut off .    in an anisotropic model",
    "we do have different classical scales and thus dimensionally also terms like @xmath401 are possible .",
    "it is then not automatic that the quantization is bounded even if @xmath402 were to be bounded . as an example for such quantities consider the spatial curvature scalar given by @xmath403 with @xmath404 in ( [ bixpot ] ) through the spin connection components . when quantized and then reduced to isotropy ,",
    "one does obtain a cut - off to the intrinsic curvature term @xmath219 as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ s : homapp ] , but the anisotropic expression remains unbounded on minisuperspace .",
    "the limit to vanishing triad components is direction dependent and the isotropic case picks out a vanishing limit .",
    "however , in general this is not the limit taken by the dynamical trajectories .",
    "similarly , in the full theory one can show that inverse volume operators are not bounded even , in contrast to anisotropic models , on states where the volume eigenvalue vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , this is difficult to interpret since nothing is known about its relevance for dynamics , and even the geometrical role of spin labels , and thus of the configurations considered , is unclear .",
    "it is then quantum dynamics which is necessary to see what properties are relevant and how degenerate configurations are approached .",
    "this should allow one to check if the classical boundary a finite distance away is removed in quantum gravity .",
    "this can only happen if quantum gravity provides candidates for a region beyond the classical singularity , and means to probe how to evolve there .",
    "the most crucial aim is to prevent incompleteness of space - time solutions or their quantum replacements .",
    "even if curvature would be finite , by itself it would not be enough since one could not tell if the singularity persists as incompleteness .",
    "only a demonstration of continuing evolution can ultimately show that singularities are absent .",
    "not all steps in the construction of the full constraint can be taken over immediately to a model since symmetry requirements have to be respected .",
    "it is thus important to have a more general construction scheme which shows how generic different steps are , and whether or not crucial input in a given symmetric situation is needed .",
    "we have already observed one such issue , which is the appearance of holonomies but also simple exponentials of connection components without integration .",
    "this is a consequence of different transformation properties of different connection components in a reduced context .",
    "components along remaining inhomogeneous directions , such as @xmath231 for einstein ",
    "rosen waves , play the role of connection components in the model , giving rise to ordinary holonomies .",
    "other components , such as @xmath370 and @xmath236 in einstein ",
    "rosen waves or all components in homogeneous models , transform as scalars and thus only appear in exponentials without integration . in the overall picture",
    ", we have the full theory with only holonomies , homogeneous models with only exponentials , and inhomogeneous models in between where both holonomies and exponentials appear .",
    "another crucial issue is that of intrinsic curvature encoded in the spin connection . in the full theory",
    ", the spin connection does not have any covariant meaning and in fact can locally be made to vanish . in symmetric models , however , some spin connection components can become covariantly well - defined since not all coordinate transformations are allowed within a model . in isotropic models , for instance , the spin connection is simply given by a constant proportional to the curvature parameter .",
    "of particular importance is the spin connection when one considers semiclassical regimes because intrinsic curvature does not need to become small there in contrast to extrinsic curvature .",
    "since the ashtekar connection mixes the spin connection and extrinsic curvature , its semiclassical properties can be rather complicated in symmetric models .",
    "the full constraint is based on holonomies around closed loops in order to approximate ashtekar curvature components when the loop becomes small in a continuum limit .",
    "for homogeneous directions , however , one can not shrink the loop and instead works with exponentials of the components .",
    "one thus approximates the classical components only when arguments of the exponential are small .",
    "if these arguments were always connection components , one would not obtain the right semiclassical properties because those components can remain large . in models",
    "one thus has to base the construction for homogeneous directions on extrinsic curvature components , i.e.subtract off the spin connection from the ashtekar connection . for inhomogeneous directions , on the other hand ,",
    "this is not possible since one needs a connection in order to define a holonomy .    at first sight",
    "this procedure seems rather ad hoc and even goes half a step back to adm variables since extrinsic curvature components are used .",
    "however , there are several places where this procedure turns out to be necessary for a variety of independent reasons .",
    "we have already seen in sec .",
    "[ s : er ] that inhomogeneous models can lead to a complicated volume operator when one insists on using all ashtekar connection components .",
    "when one allows for extrinsic curvature components in the way just described , on the other hand , the volume operator becomes straightforward .",
    "this appeared after performing a canonical transformation which rests non - trivially on the form of inhomogeneous spin connections and extrinsic curvature tensors .",
    "moreover , in addition to the semiclassical limit used above as justification one also has to discuss local stability of the resulting evolution equation @xcite : since higher order difference equations have additional solutions , one must ensure that they do not become dominant in order not to spoil the continuum limit .",
    "this is satisfied with the above construction , while it is generically violated if one were to use only connection components .",
    "there is thus a common construction scheme available based on holonomies and exponentials . as already discussed , this is responsible for correction terms in a continuum limit , but also gives rise to the constraint equation being a difference equation in a triad representation , whenever it exists . in homogeneous models",
    "the structure of the resulting difference equation is clear , but there are different open possibilities in inhomogeneous models .",
    "this is intimately related to the issue of anomalies , which also appears only in inhomogeneous models .    with a fixed choice",
    ", one has to solve a set of coupled difference equations for a wave function on superspace .",
    "the basic question then always is what kind of initial or boundary value problem has to be used in order to ensure the existence of solutions with suitable properties , e.g.  in a semiclassical regime .",
    "once this is specified one can already discuss the singularity problem since one needs to find out if initial conditions in one semiclassical regime together with boundary conditions away from classical singularities suffice for a unique solution on all of superspace .",
    "a secondary question is how this equation can be interpreted as evolution equation for the wave function in an internal time .",
    "this is not strictly necessary and can be complicated owing to the problem of time in general .",

    "this shows that a resolution of singularities has not only to provide a new region , but also an evolution there uniquely from initial values at one side . )",
    "a wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization would similarly lead to diverging matter hamiltonian operators and the initial value problem for the wave function generically breaks down . in isotropic loop quantum cosmology we have already seen that the matter hamiltonian does not have diverging contributions from inverse metric components even at the classical singularity .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution could break down if highest order coefficients in the difference equation become zero .",
    "this indeed happens with the non - symmetric constraint ( [ diffiso ] ) or ( [ difflrs ] ) , but in these cases can be seen not to lead to any problems : some coefficients can become zero such that the wave function at @xmath405 remains undetermined by initial conditions , but the wave function at the other side of the classical singularity is still determined uniquely . there is no breakdown of evolution , and thus no singularity @xcite . as one can see",
    ", this relies on crucial properties of the loop representation with well - defined inverse metric components and a difference rather than differential equation @xcite .",
    "also the structure of difference equations is important , depending on some choices .",
    "most important is the factor ordering or symmetrization chosen . as just discussed , the ordering used earlier leads to non - singular evolution but with the wave function at the classical singularity itself remaining undetermined . in anisotropic models",
    "one can symmetrize the constraint and obtain a difference equation , such as ( [ difflrssymm ] ) , whose leading order coefficients never vanish .",
    "evolution then never stops and even the wave function at the classical singularity is determined . in the isotropic case , direct symmetrization would lead to a break - down of evolution , which thus provides an example for singular quantum evolution and demonstrates the non - triviality of continuing evolution : the leading order coefficient would then be @xmath406 which vanishes if and only if @xmath407 .",
    "thus , in the backward evolution @xmath408 remains undetermined , just as @xmath409 is undetermined in the non - symmetric ordering .",
    "however , now @xmath408 would be needed to evolve further .",
    "since it is not determined by initial data , one would need to prescribe this value , or else the evolution stops .",
    "there is thus a new region at negative @xmath254 , but evolution does not continue uniquely between the two sides .",
    "in such a case , even though curvature is bounded , the quantum system would be singular .",
    "similar behavior happens in other orderings such as when triads are ordered to the left .",
    "note that also in the full theory one can not order triads to the left since otherwise the constraint would not be densely defined @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the symmetric ordering in isotropic models is special and related to the fact that all directions degenerate .",
    "the breakdown does not happen for a symmetric ordering in anisotropic or even inhomogeneous systems .",
    "one can avert it in isotropic cases by multiplying the constraint with @xmath410 before symmetrizing , so that the additional factor of @xmath411 leads to non - zero coefficients as in ( [ diffisosymm ] ) .",
    "this is the general scheme which also applies in more complicated cases .",
    "the prime example for the general homogeneous behavior is given by the kasner evolution of the bianchi i model . here , the approach to the singularity is not isotropic but given in such a way that two of the three diagonal metric components become zero while the third one diverges .",
    "this would lead to a different picture than described before since the classical singularity then lies at the infinite boundary of metric or co - triad minisuperspace .",
    "also unlike in the isotropic case , densities or curvature potentials are not necessarily bounded in general as functions on minisuperspace , and the classical dynamical approach is important . in densitized triad variables ,",
    "however , we have a situation as before since here all components approach zero , although at different rates . now",
    "the classical singularity is in the interior of minisuperspace and one can study the evolution as before , again right through the classical singularity .",
    "note that densitized triad variables were required for a background independent quantization , and now independently for non - singular evolution .",
    "other homogeneous models are more complicated since for them kasner motion takes place with a potential given by curvature components .",
    "approximate kasner epochs arise when the potential is negligible , intermitted by reflections at the potential walls where the direction of kasner motion in the anisotropy plane changes .",
    "still , since in each kasner epoch the densitized triad components decrease , the classical singularity remains in the interior and is penetrated by the discrete quantum evolution .",
    "one can use this for indications as to the general inhomogeneous behavior by making use of the bkl scenario .",
    "if this can be justified , in each spatial point the evolution of geometry is given by a homogeneous model .",
    "for the quantum formulation this indicates that also here classical singularities are removed .",
    "however , it is by no means clear whether the bkl scenario applies at the quantum level since even classically it is not generally established . if the scenario is not realized ( or if some matter systems can change the local behavior ) , diverging @xmath103 are possible and the behavior would qualitatively be very different .",
    "one thus has to study the inhomogeneous quantum evolution directly as done before for homogeneous cases .    in the 1-dimensional models described here classical singularities arise when @xmath369 becomes zero .",
    "since this is now a field , it depends on the point @xmath216 on the spatial manifold where the slice hits the classical singularity . at each such place",
    ", midisuperspace opens up to a new region not reached by the classical evolution , where the sign of @xmath412 changes and thus the local orientation of the triad .",
    "again , the kinematics automatically provides us with these new regions just as needed , and quantum evolution continues . also , the scheme is realized much more non - trivially , and now even the non - symmetric ordering is not allowed .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath413 for a single edge label does not imply that neighboring volume eigenvalues vanish .",
    "there is thus no obvious decoupling in a non - singular manner , and it shows how less symmetric situations put more stringent restrictions on the allowed dynamics . still , the availability of other possibilities , maybe with leading coefficients which can vanish and result in decoupling , needs to be analyzed .",
    "most importantly , the symmetric version still leads to non - singular evolution even in those inhomogeneous cases which have local gravitational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "there is thus a general scheme for the removal of singularities : in the classical situation one has singular boundaries of superspace which can not be penetrated .",
    "densitized triad variables then lead to new regions , given by a change in the orientation factor @xmath414 which , however , does not help classically since singularities remain as interior boundaries . for the quantum situation one has to look at the constraint equation and see whether or not it uniquely allows to continue a wave function to the other side ( which does not require time parameters even though they may be helpful if available ) .",
    "this usually depends on factor ordering and other choices which arise in the construction of constraint operators and play a role also for the anomaly issue .",
    "one can thus fix ambiguities by selecting a non - singular constraint if possible .",
    "however , the existence of non - singular versions , as realized in a natural fashion in homogeneous models , is a highly non - trivial and by no means automatic property of the theory showing its overall consistency .    in inhomogeneous models",
    "the issue is more complicated .",
    "we thus have a situation where the theory , which so far is well - defined , can be tested by trying to extend results to more general cases .",
    "it should also be noted that different models should not require different quantization choices unless symmetry itself is clearly responsible ( as happens with the orientation factor in the symmetric ordering for an isotropic model , or when non - zero spin connection components receive covariant meaning in models ) , but that there should rather be a common scheme leading to non - singular behavior .",
    "this puts further strong conditions on the construction , and is possible only if one knows how models and the full theory are related .      in isotropic models",
    "the gravitational part of the constraint corresponds to an ordinary difference operator which can be interpreted as generating evolution in internal time .",
    "one thus needs to specify only initial conditions to solve the equation .",
    "the number of conditions is large since , first , the procedure to construct the constraint operator usually results in higher order equations and , second , this equation relates values of a wave function @xmath298 defined on an uncountable set . in general ,",
    "one thus has to choose a function on a real interval unless further conditions are used .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by using observables which can reduce the kinematical framework back to wave functions defined on a countable discrete lattice @xcite .",
    "similar restrictions can come from semiclassical properties or the physical inner product @xcite , all of which has not yet been studied in generality .",
    "the situation in homogeneous models is similar , but now one has several gravitational degrees of freedom only one of which is interpreted as internal time .",
    "one has a partial difference equation for a wave function on a minisuperspace with boundary , and initial as well as boundary conditions are required @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions are imposed only at non - singular parts of mini - superspace such as @xmath405 in lrs models ( [ difflrs ] ) .",
    "they must not be imposed at places of classical singularities , of course , where instead the evolution must continue just as at any regular part .    in inhomogeneous models , then , there are not only many independent kinematical variables but also many difference equations for only one wave function on midisuperspace .",
    "these difference equations are of a similar type as in homogeneous models , but they are coupled in complicated ways . since one has several choices in the general construction of the constraint , there are different possibilities for the way how difference equations arise and are coupled .",
    "not all of them are expected to be consistent , i.e.  in many cases some of the difference equations will not be compatible such that there would be no non - zero solution at all .",
    "this is related to the anomaly issue since the commutation behavior of difference operators is important for properties and the existence of common solutions .",
    "so far , the evolution operator in inhomogeneous models has not been studied in detail , and solutions in this case remain poorly understood .",
    "the difficulty of this issue can be illustrated by the expectations in spherical symmetry where there is only one classical physical degree of freedom .",
    "if this is to be reproduced for semiclassical solutions of the quantum constraint , there must be a subtle elimination of infinitely many kinematical degrees of freedom such that in the end only one physical degree of freedom remains .",
    "thus , from the many parameters needed in general to specify a solution to a set of difference equations , only one can remain when compatibility relations between the coupled difference equations and semiclassicality conditions are taken into account .",
    "how much this cancellation depends on semiclassicality and asymptotic infinity conditions remains to be seen .",
    "some influence is to be expected since classical behavior should have a bearing on the correct reproduction of classical degrees of freedom .",
    "however , it may also turn out that the number of solutions to the quantum constraint is more sensitive to quantum effects .",
    "it is already known from isotropic models that the constraint equation can imply additional conditions for solutions beyond the higher order difference equation , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ s : dynin ] .",
    "this usually arises at the place of classical singularities where the order of the difference equation can change .",
    "since the quantum behavior at classical singularities is important here , the number of solutions can be different from the classically expected freedom , even when combined with possible semiclassical requirements far away from the singularity .",
    "we will now first discuss these requirements in semiclassical regimes , followed by more information on possibly arising additional conditions for solutions .",
    "the high order of difference equations implies that there are in general many independent solutions , most of which are oscillating on small scales , i.e.  when the labels change only slightly .",
    "one possibility to restrict the number of solutions then is to require suppressed or even absent oscillations on small scales @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this seems to be a pre - requisite for semiclassical behavior and has thus been called pre - classicality .",
    "it can be motivated by the fact that a semiclassical solution should not be sensitive to small changes of , e.g. , the volume by amounts of planck size . however , even though the criterion sounds intuitively reasonable , there is so far no justification through more physical arguments involving observables or measurement processes to extract information from wave functions .",
    "the status of pre - classicality as a selection criterion is thus not final .",
    "moreover , pre - classicality is not always consistent in all disjoint classical regimes or with other conditions .",
    "for instance , as discussed in the following section , there can be additional conditions on wave functions arising from the constraint equation at the classical singularity .",
    "such conditions do not arise in classical regimes , but they nevertheless have implications for the behavior of wave functions there through the evolution equation @xcite .",
    "pre - classicality also may not be possible to impose in all disconnected classical regimes . if the evolution equation is locally stable , which is a basic criterion for constructing the constraint , choosing initial values in classical regimes which do not have small - scale oscillations guarantees that oscillations do not build up through evolution in a classical regime @xcite .",
    "however , when the solution is extended through the quantum regime around a classical singularity , oscillations do arise and do not in general decay after a new supposedly classical regime beyond the singularity is entered .",
    "it is thus not obvious that indeed a new semiclassical region forms even if the quantum evolution for the wave function is non - singular . on the other hand",
    ", evolution does continue to large volume and macroscopic regions , which is different from other scenarios such as @xcite where inhomogeneities have been quantized on a background .",
    "a similar issue is the boundedness of solutions , which also is motivated intuitively by referring to the common probability interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite but must be supported by an analysis of physical inner products .",
    "the issue arises in particular in classically forbidden regions where one expects exponentially growing and decaying solutions .",
    "if a classically forbidden region extends to infinite volume , as happens for models of recollapsing universes , the probability interpretation would require that only the exponentially decaying solution is realized .",
    "as before , such a condition at large volume is in general not consistent in all asymptotic regions or with other conditions arising in quantum regimes .",
    "both issues , pre - classicality and boundedness , seem to be reasonable , but their physical significance has to be founded on properties of the physical inner product .",
    "they are rather straightforward to analyze in isotropic models without matter fields , where one is dealing with ordinary difference equations",
    ". however , other cases can be much more complicated such that conclusions drawn from isotropic models alone can be misleading .",
    "moreover , numerical investigations have to be taken with care since in particular for boundedness an exponentially increasing contribution can easily arise from numerical errors and dominate the exact , potentially bounded solution .",
    "one thus needs analytical or at least semi - analytical techniques to deal with these issues . for pre - classicality",
    "one can advantageously use generating function techniques @xcite if the difference equation is of a suitable form , e.g.  has only coefficients with integer powers of the discrete parameter . the generating function @xmath415 for a solution @xmath416 on an equidistant lattice then solves a differential equation equivalent to the difference equation for @xmath416 .",
    "if @xmath417 is known , one can use its pole structure to get hints for the degree of oscillations in @xmath416 .",
    "in particular the behavior around @xmath418 is of interest to rule out alternating behavior where @xmath416 is of the form @xmath419 with @xmath420 for all @xmath421 ( or at least all @xmath421 larger than a certain value ) . at @xmath418",
    "we then have @xmath422 , which is less convergent than the value for a non - alternating solution @xmath423 resulting in @xmath424 .",
    "one can similarly find conditions for the pole structure to guarantee boundedness of @xmath416 , but the power of the method depends on the form of the difference equation .",
    "more general techniques are available for the boundedness issue , and also for alternating behavior , by mapping the difference equation to a continued fraction which can be evaluated analytically or numerically @xcite .",
    "one can then systematically find initial values for solutions which are guaranteed to be bounded .",

    ", there is a new possibility opened up by loop quantum cosmology where the dynamical law and initial conditions can be part of the same entity @xcite .",
    "this is a specialty of difference equations whose order can change locally , in contrast to differential equations .",
    "mathematically , such a difference equation would be called singular since its leading order coefficients can become zero . however , physically we have already seen that the behavior is non - singular since the evolution does not break down .",
    "the difference equation follows from the constraint equation , which is the primary object in canonical quantum gravity . as discussed before , it is usually of high order in classical regimes , where the number of solutions can be restricted , e.g. , by pre - classicality . but this at most brings us to the number of solutions which we have for the wheeler  dewitt equation such that one needs additional conditions as in this approach .",
    "the new aspect now is that this can follow from the constraint equation itself : since the order of the difference equation can become smaller at the classical singularity , there are less solutions than expected from the semiclassical behavior . in the simplest models",
    "this is just enough to result in a unique solution up to norm , as appropriate for a wave function describing a universe . in those cases ,",
    "the dynamical initial conditions are comparable to dewitt s initial condition , albeit in a manner which is well - posed even in some cases where dewitt s condition is not @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the issue is not clear but should be seen as a new option presented by the discrete formulation of loop quantum cosmology . since there can be many conditions to be imposed on wave functions in different regimes , one has to see in each model whether or not suitable non - zero solutions remain at all .",
    "in fact , some first investigations indicate that different requirements taken together can be very restrictive @xcite , which seems to relate well with the non - separability of the kinematical hilbert space @xcite .",
    "so far , only homogeneous models have been investigated in detail , but the mechanism of decoupling is known not to be realized in an identical manner in inhomogeneous models .",
    "inhomogeneous models can add qualitatively new ingredients also to the issue of initial conditions due to the fact that there are many coupled difference equations .",
    "there can then be consistency conditions for solutions to the combined system which can strongly restrict the number of independent solutions .",
    "this may be welcome , e.g.  in spherical symmetry where a single physical parameter remains , but the restriction can easily become too strong even below the classically expected one . since the consistency between difference equations is related to the anomaly issue , there may be an important role played by quantum anomalies .",
    "while classically anomalies should be absent , the quantum situation can be different since it also takes the behavior at the classical singularity into account and is supposed to describe the whole universe .",
    "anomalies can then be precisely what one needs in order to have a unique wave function of a universe even in inhomogeneous cases where initially there is much more freedom .",
    "this does not mean that anomalies are simply ignored or taken lightly since it is difficult to arange having the right balance between many solutions and no non - zero solution at all .",
    "however , quantum cosmology suggests that it is worthwhile to have a less restricted , unconventional view on the anomaly issue .",
    "there is a general construction of a loop representation in the full theory and its models , which is characterized by compactified connection spaces and discrete triad operators .",
    "strong simplifications of some technical and conceptual steps occur in diverse models .",
    "such a general construction allows a view not only on the simplest case , isotropy , but on essentially all representative systems for gravity .",
    "most important is the dynamics , which in the models discussed here can be formulated by a difference equation on superspace .",
    "a general scheme for a unique extension of wave functions through classical singularities is realized , such that the quantum theory is non - singular .",
    "this general argument , which has been verified in many models , is quite powerful since it does not require detailed knowledge of or assumptions about matter .",
    "it is independent of the availability of a global internal time , and so the problem of time does not present an obstacle .",
    "moreover , a complicated discussion of quantum observables can be avoided since once it is known that a wave function can be continued uniquely one can extract relational information at both sides of the classical singularity .",
    "( if observables would distinguish both sides with their opposite oriantations , they would strongly break parity even on large scales in contradiction with classical gravity . ) similarly , information on the physical inner product is not required since there is a general statement for all solutions of the constraint equation .",
    "the uniqueness of an extension through the classical singularity thus remains even if some solutions have to be excluded for the physical hilbert space or factored out if they have zero norm .",
    "this is far from saying that observables or the physical inner product are irrelevant for an understanding of dynamical processes .",
    "such constructions can , fortunately , be avoided for a general statement of non - singular evolution in a wide class of models . for details of the transition and to get information of the precise form of space - time at the other side of classical singularities , however , all those objects are necessary and conceptual problems in their context have to be understood .",
    "so far , the transition has often been visualized by intuitive pictures such as a collapsing universe turning its inside out when orientation is reversed .",

    "the question thus arises what the precise relation between models and the full theory is , or even how and to what extent a model for a given symmetry type can be derived from the full theory .",
    "this is possible for the basic representation : the symmetry and the partial background it provides can be used to define natural subalgebras of the full holonomy / flux algebra by using holonomies and fluxes along symmetry generators and averaging in a suitable manner . since the full representation is unique and cyclic , it induces uniquely a representation of models which is taken directly from the full theory .",

    "one can imagine to construct states which are invariant under a given action of a symmetry group on space by starting with a general state and naively summing over all its possible translates by elements of the symmetry group .",
    "for instance on spin network states , the symmetry group acts by moving the graph underlying the spin network , keeping the labels fixed . since states with different graphs",
    "are orthogonal to each other , the sum over uncountably many different translates can not be normalizable . in simple cases , such as for graphs with a single edge along a symmetry generator",
    ", one can easily make sense of the sum as a distribution .",
    "but this is not clear for arbitrary states , in particular for states whose graphs have vertices , which on the other hand would be needed for sufficient generality .",
    "a further problem is that any such action of a symmetry group is a subgroup of the diffeomorphism group . at least on compact space manifolds where there are no asymptotic conditions for diffeomorphisms in the gauge group",
    ", it then seems that any group averaged diffeomorphism invariant state would already be symmetric with respect to arbitrary symmetries , which is obviously not sensible .",

    "they can also be formulated as constraints added to the theory , but these constraints must be second class for a well defined framework : one obtains a consistent reduced theory , e.g.  with a non - degenerate symplectic structure , only if configuration and momentum variables are required to be symmetric in the same ( or dual ) way .    in the case of gravity in ashtekar variables , the symmetry type determines , along the lines of app .  [",
    "s : invconn ] the form of invariant connections and densitized triads defining the phase space of the reduced model . at the quantum level , however , one can not keep connections and triads on the same footing since a polarization is required .",
    "one usually uses the connection representation in loop quantum gravity such that states are functionals on the space of connections . in a minisuperspace quantization of the classically reduced model states",
    "would then be functionals only of invariant connections for the given symmetry type .",
    "this suggests to define symmetric states in the full theory to be those states whose support contains invariant connections as a dense subset @xcite ( one requires only a dense subset because possible generalized connections must be allowed for ) . as such",
    ", they must necessarily be distributional , as already expected from the naive attempt at construction .",
    "symmetric states thus form a subset of the distributional space @xmath47 . in this manner , only the reduced degrees of freedom are relevant , i.e.  the reduction is complete , and all of them are indeed realized , i.e.  the reduction is not too strong .",
    "moreover , an `` averaging '' map from a non - symmetric state to a symmetric one can easily be defined by restricting the non - symmetric state to the space of invariant connections and requiring it to vanish everywhere else .",

    "appropriately defined subspaces of @xmath47 nevertheless often carry natural inner products which is also the case here .",
    "in fact , since the reduced space of invariant connections can be treated by the same mathematical techniques as the full space , it carries an analog of the full ashtekar ",
    "lewandowski measure and this is indeed induced from the unique representation of the full theory .",
    "the only difference is that in general an invariant connection is not only determined by a reduced connection but also by scalar fields ( see app .",
    "[ s : invconn ] ) . as in the full theory",
    ", this space @xmath427 of reduced connections and scalars is compactified to the space @xmath428 of generalized invariant connections on which the reduced hilbert space is defined .",
    "one thus arrives at the same hilbert space for the subset of symmetric states in @xmath47 as used before for reduced models , e.g.   using the bohr compactification in isotropic models .",
    "the new ingredient now is that these states have meaning in the full theory as distributions , whose evaluation on normalizable states depends on the symmetry type and partial background structure used .    that the symmetric hilbert space obtained in this manner is identical to the reduced loop quantization of sec .",

    "in such a case , the reduction at the quantum level would give rise to more degrees of freedom than a loop quantization of the classically reduced model . as shown in @xcite , however , the set of invariant connections is a closed subset of the full space of connections such that loop quantum cosmology can be interpreted as a minisuperspace quantization .      in the classical reduction ,",
    "symmetry conditions are imposed on both connections and triads , but so far at the level of states only connections have been taken into account .",
    "configuration and momentum variables play different roles in any quantum theory since a polarization is necessary . as we based the construction on the connection representation ,",
    "symmetric triads have to be implemented at the operator level .",
    "( there can not be additional reduction steps at the state level since , as we already observed , states just implement the right number of reduced degrees of freedom . )",
    "classically , the reduction of phase space functions is simply done by pull back to the reduced phase space .",
    "the flow generated by the reduced functions then necessarily stays in the reduced phase space and defines canonical transformations for the model .",
    "an analog statement in the corresponding quantum theory would mean that the reduced state space would be fixed by full operators such that their action ( or dual action on distributions ) could directly be used in the model without further work .",
    "this , however , is not the case with the reduction performed so far .",
    "we have considered only connections in the reduction of states , and also classically a reduction to a subspace @xmath429 where connections are invariant but not triads would be incomplete .",
    "first , this would not define a phase space of its own with a non - degenerate symplectic structure .",
    "more important in this context is the fact that this subspace would not be preserved by the flow of reduced functions .    as an example",
    "( see also @xcite for a different discussion in the spherically symmetric model ) we consider a diagonal homogeneous model , such as bianchi i for simplicity , with connections of the form @xmath430 and look at the flow generated by the full volume @xmath431 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the poisson bracket @xmath432 already used in ( [ ident ] ) . a point on @xmath433 characterized by @xmath434 and an arbitrary triad thus changes infinitesimally by @xmath435 which does not preserve the invariant form : first , on the right hand side we have arbitrary fields @xmath149 such that @xmath436 is not homogeneous .",
    "second , even if we would restrict ourselves to homogeneous @xmath149 , @xmath436 would not be of the original diagonal form .",
    "this is the case only if @xmath437 since only the @xmath438 are canonical variables .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied only if @xmath439 vanishes , which is not the case in general .",
    "this condition is true only if @xmath440 , i.e.  if we restrict the triads to be of diagonal homogeneous form just as the connections .",
    "a reduction of only one part of the canonical variables is thus incomplete and leads to a situation where most phase space functions generate a flow which does not stay in the reduced space .",
    "analogously , the dual action of full operators on symmetric distributional states does not in general map this space to itself .",
    "thus , an arbitrary full operator maps a symmetric state to a non - symmetric one and can not be used to define the reduced operator . in general",
    ", one needs a second reduction step which implements invariant triads at the level of operators by an appropriate projection of its action back to the symmetric space",
    ". this can be quite complicated , and fortunately there are special full operators adapted to the symmetry for which this step is not necessary .    from the above example",
    "it is clear that those operators must be linear in the momenta @xmath8 for otherwise one would have a triad remaining after evaluating the poisson bracket which on @xmath433 would not be symmetric everywhere .",
    "fluxes are linear in the momenta , so we can try @xmath441 where @xmath442 is a surface in the @xmath443-plane at position @xmath444 in the @xmath293-direction . by choosing a surface along symmetry generators @xmath252 and @xmath445 this expression",
    "is adapted to the symmetry , even though it is not fully symmetric yet since the position @xmath446 has to be chosen .",
    "again , we compute the poisson bracket @xmath447 resulting in @xmath448 also here the right hand side is not homogeneous , but we have @xmath449 such that the diagonal form is preserved",
    ". the violation of homogeneity is expected since the flux is not homogeneous .",
    "this can easily be remedied by `` averaging '' the flux in the @xmath293-direction to @xmath450 where @xmath451 is the coordinate length of the @xmath293-direction if it is compact . for any finite @xmath86",
    "the expression is well - defined and can directly be quantized , and the limit can be performed in a well - defined manner at the quantum level of the full theory .",
    "most importantly , the resulting operator preserves the form of symmetric states for the diagonal homogeneous model in its dual action , corresponding to the flux operator of the reduced model as used before . in averaging the full operator",
    "the partial background provided by the group action has been used , which is responsible for the degeneracy between edge length and spin in one reduced flux label .",
    "similarly , one can obtain holonomy operators along the @xmath289-direction which preserve the form of symmetric states after averaging them along the @xmath290 and @xmath293 directions ( in such a way that the edge length is variable in the averaging limit ) .",
    "thus , the dual action of full operators is sufficient to derive all basic operators of the model from the full theory .",
    "the representation of states and basic operators , which was seen to be responsible for most effects in loop quantum cosmology , is thus directly linked to the full theory .",
    "this , then , defines the cosmological sector of loop quantum gravity .      when quantizing a model after a classical reduction there is much freedom even in choosing the basic representation . for instance , in homogeneous models one can use the wheeler  dewitt formulation based on the schrdinger representation of quantum mechanics . in other models",
    "one could choose different smearings , e.g.  treating triad components by holonomies and connection components by fluxes , since transformation properties can change from the reduced point of view ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is thus no analog of the uniqueness theorem of the full theory , and models constructed in this manner would have much inherent freedom even at a basic level . with the link to the full theory , however , properties of the unique representation there are transferred directly to models , resulting in analogous properties such as discrete fluxes and an action only of exponentiated connection components .",
    "this is sufficient for a construction by analogy of composite operators , such as the hamiltonian constraint according to the general scheme .",
    "if the basic representation is taken from the full quantization , one makes sure that many consistency conditions of quantum gravity are already observed .",
    "this can never be guaranteed when classically reduced models are quantized since then many consistency conditions trivialize as a consequence of simplifications in the model .",
    "in particular , background independence requires special properties , as emphasized before .",
    "a symmetric model , however , always incorporates a partial background and within a model alone one can not determine which structures are required for background independence . in loop quantum cosmology , on the other hand , this is realized thanks to the link to the full theory .",
    "even though a model in loop quantum cosmology can also be seen as obtained by a particular minisuperspace quantization , it is distinguished by the fact that its representation is derived by quantizing before performing the reduction .",
    "in general , symmetry conditions take the form of second class constraints since they are imposed for both connections and triads .",
    "it is often said that second class constraints always have to be solved classically before the quantization because of quantum uncertainty relations .",
    "this seems to make impossible the above statement that symmetry conditions can be imposed after quantizing .",
    "it is certainly true that there is no state in a quantum system satisfying all second class constraints of a given reduction . also using distributional states , as required for first class constraints with zero in the continuous spectrum , does not help .",
    "the reduction described above thus does not simply proceed in this way by finding states , normalizable or distributional , in the full quantization .",
    "instead , the reduction is done at the operator algebra level , or alternatively the selection of symmetric states is accompanied by a reduction of operators which at least for basic ones can be performed explicitly . in general terms , one does not look for a sub - representation of the full quantum representation , but for a representation of a suitable subalgebra of operators related to the symmetry .",
    "this gives a well - defined map from the full basic representation to a new basic representation for the model . in this map ,",
    "non - symmetric degrees of freedom are removed irrespective of the uncertainty relations from the full point of view .",
    "since the basic representations of the full theory and the model are related , it is clear that similar ambiguities arise in the construction of composite operators .",
    "some of them are inherited directly , such as the representation label @xmath119 one can choose when connection components are represented through holonomies @xcite .",
    "other ambiguities are reduced in models since many choices can result in the same form or are restricted by adaptations to the symmetry .",
    "this is for instance the case for positions of new vertices created by the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "however , also new ambiguities can arise from degeneracies such as that between spin labels and edge lengths resulting in the parameter @xmath22 in sec .",
    "[ s : isoham ] . also factor",
    "ordering can appear more ambiguously in a model and lead to less unique operators than in the full theory . as a simple example we can consider a system with two degrees of freedom @xmath452 constrained to be equal to each other : @xmath453 , @xmath454 . in the unconstrained plane @xmath455 ,",
    "angular momentum is given by @xmath456 with an unambiguous quantization .",
    "classically , @xmath290 vanishes on the constraint surface @xmath457 , but in the quantum system ambiguities arise : @xmath458 and @xmath459 commute before but not after reduction .",
    "there is thus a factor ordering ambiguity in the reduction which is absent in the unconstrained system . since angular momentum operators formally appear in the volume operator of loop quantum gravity , it is not surprising that models have additional factor ordering ambiguities in their volume operators .",
    "fortunately , they are harmless and result , e.g. , in differences as an isotropic volume spectrum @xmath460 compared to @xmath461 where the second form @xcite is closer to su(2 ) as compared to u(1 ) expressions .      most physical applications in quantum gravity are obtained in mini- or midisuperspace approximations by focusing only on degrees of freedom relevant for a given situation of interest .",
    "other degrees of freedom and their interactions with the remaining ones are ignored so as to simplify the complicated full dynamics .",
    "their role in particular for the evolution , however , is not always clear , and so one should check what happens if they are gradually tuned in .",
    "there are examples , in the spirit of @xcite , where minisuperspace results are markedly different from less symmetric ones . in those analyses , however , already the classical reduction is unstable , or back reaction is important , and thus solutions which start almost symmetric move away rapidly from the symmetric submanifold of the full phase space . the failure of a minisuperspace quantization in those cases can thus already be decided classically and is not a quantum gravity issue .",
    "even a violation of uncertainty relations , which occurs in any reduction at the quantum level , is not automatically dangerous but only if corresponding classical models are unstable .    as for the general approach to a classical singularity ,",
    "the anisotropic behavior and not so much inhomogeneities is considered to be essential .",
    "isotropy can indeed be misleading , but the anisotropic behavior is more characteristic .",
    "in fact , relevant features of full calculations on a single vertex @xcite agree with the anisotropic @xcite , but not the isotropic behavior @xcite . also patching of homogeneous models to form an inhomogeneous space",
    "reproduces some full results even at a quantitative level @xcite .",
    "the main differences and simplifications of models can be traced back to an effective abelianization of the full su(2)-gauge transformations , which is not introduced by hand in this case but a consequence of symmetries .",
    "it is also one of the reasons why geometrical configurations in models are usually easier to interpret than in the full theory .",
    "most importantly , it implies strong conceptual simplifications since it allows a triad representation in which the dynamics can be understood more intuitively than in a connection representation .",
    "explicit results in models have thus been facilitated by this property of basic variables , and therefore a comparison with analogous situations in the full theory is most interesting in this context , and most important as a test of models .",
    "if one is using a quantization of a classically reduced system , it can only be considered a model for full quantum gravity .",
    "relations between different models and the full theory are important in order to specify to what degree such models approximate the full situation , and where additional correction terms by the ignored degrees of freedom have to be taken into account .",
    "this is under systematic investigation in loop quantum cosmology .      by now , many models are available explicitly and can be compared with each other and the full theory .",
    "original investigations were done in isotropic models which in many respects are special , but important aspects of the loop quantization are now known to be realized in all models and sometimes the full theory without contradictions so far .",
    "there is thus a consistent picture of singularity - free dynamical behavior together with candidates for characteristic phenomenology .",
    "there are certainly differences between models , which can be observed already for geometrical spectra such as area or volume .",
    "akin to level splitting in atoms or molecules , spectra become more complicated when symmetry is reduced @xcite . also the behavior of densities or curvatures on arbitrary geometrical configurations",
    "can be different in different models . in isotropic models ,",
    "densities are bounded which is a kinematical statement but in this case important for a singularity free evolution .",
    "it is important here since minisuperspace is just one - dimensional and so dynamical trajectories could not pass regions of unbounded curvature should they exist .",
    "anisotropic models are more characteristic for the approach to classical singularities , and here curvature expressions in general remain unbounded if all of minisuperspace is considered . again ,",
    "this is only kinematical , and here the dynamics tells us that evolution does not proceed along directions of unbounded curvature .",
    "this is similar in inhomogeneous models studied so far .    in the full theory",
    "the situation becomes again more complicated since here densities can be unbounded even on degenerate configurations of vanishing volume eigenvalue @xcite . in this case , however , it is not known what the significance for evolution is , or even the geometrical meaning of the degenerate configurations .    as an analogy one can , as before , take spectroscopy of atoms and level splitting .",
    "essential properties , such as the stability of the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics as opposed to the classical theory , are unchanged if complicated interactions are taken into account .",
    "it is important to take into account , in this context , that stability can and does change if arbitrary interactions would be considered , rather than realistic ones which one already fixed from other observations .",
    "hydrogen then remains stable under those realistic interactions , but its properties would change drastically if any possible interaction term would be considered . similarly , it is not helpful to consider the behavior of densities on arbitrary geometries unless it is known which configurations are important for dynamics or at least their geometrical role is clear .",
    "dynamics in the canonical picture is encoded in the hamiltonian constraint , and including it ( or suitable observables ) in the analysis is analogous , in the picture of atomic spectra , to making use of realistic gravitational interaction terms . in the full theory ,",
    "such an analysis is currently beyond reach , but it has been extensively studied in loop quantum cosmology . since the non - singular behavior of models , whether or not curvature is bounded , is a consequence of basic effects and the representation derived from the full theory , it can be taken as reliable information on the behavior in quantum geometry .",
    "in the context of loop quantum cosmology or loop quantum gravity in general some wider issues arise which have already been touched briefly .",
    "this has to be seen in the general context of what one should expect from quantum theories of gravity for which there are several quite different approaches .",
    "these issues deal with questions about the uniqueness of theories or solutions and what information is accessible in one universe . also",
    "the role of time plays a more general role , and the related question of unitarity or determinism .      _",

    "not surprisingly , the result is often viewed skeptically since it is very different from other well - studied quantum field theories .",
    "usually , intuition in quantum field theory comes either from models which are so special that they are completely integrable , or from perturbative expansions around free field theories .",
    "since no relevant ambiguities arise in this context , ambiguities in other frameworks are usually viewed with suspicion .",
    "a similar treatment is not possible for gravity because a complete formulation as a perturbation series around a free theory is unavailable and would anyway not be suitable in important situations of high curvature .",
    "in fact , reformulations as free theories exist only in special , non - dynamical backgrounds such as minkowski space or planar waves which , if used , immediately introduce a background .",
    "if this is to be avoided in a background independent formulation , it is necessary to deal with the full non - linear theory .",
    "this leads to complicated expressions with factor ordering and other ambiguities which are usually avoided in quantum field theory but not unfamiliar from quantum theory in general .",
    "sometimes it is said that such a theory looses its predictive power or even suggested to stop working on applications of the theory until all ambiguities are eliminated .",
    "this view , of course , demonstrates a misunderstanding of the scientific process where general effects play important roles even if they can be quantified only at later stages .",
    "what is important is to show that qualitative effects are robust enough such that their implications do not crucially depend on one choice among many .",
    "so far , applications of loop quantum gravity and cosmology are in comparative stages where reliable effects can be derived from basic properties and remaining ambiguities preclude sharp quantitative predictions in general ( notable exceptions are fundamental properties , such as the computation of @xmath14 through black hole entropy @xcite ) .",
    "these ambiguities have to be constrained by further theoretical investigations of the overall consistency , or by possible observations",
    ".    ambiguities certainly mean that a theory can not be formulated uniquely , and uniqueness often plays a role in discussions of quantum gravity . in the many approaches",
    "different kinds of uniqueness have been advertised , most importantly the uniqueness of the whole theory , or the uniqueness of a solution appropriate for the one universe we can observe .",
    "both expectations seem reasonable , though immodest .",
    "but they are conceptually very different and even , maybe surprisingly , inconsistent with each other as physical properties : for let us assume that we have a theory from which we know that it has one and only one solution .",
    "provided that there is sufficient computational access to that theory , it is falsifiable by comparing properties of the solution with observations in the universe .",
    "now , our observational access to the universe will always be limited and so , even if the one solution of our theory does agree with observations , we can always find ways to change the theory without being in observational conflict .",
    "the theory thus can not be unique .",
    "changing it in the described situation may only violate other , external conditions which are not observable .",
    "the converse , that a unique theory can not have a unique solution , follows by logically reversing the above argument .",
    "however , one has to be careful about different notions of uniqueness of a theory .",
    "it is clear from the above argument that uniqueness of a theory can be realized only under external , such as mathematical , conditions which always are a matter of taste and depend on existing knowledge .",
    "nevertheless , the statement seems to be supported by current realizations of quantum gravity .",
    "string theory is one example where the supposed uniqueness of the theory is far outweighed by the non - uniqueness of its solutions .",
    "it should also be noted that the uniqueness of a theory is not falsifiable , and therefore not a scientific claim , unless its solutions are sufficiently restricted within the theory .",
    "otherwise , one can always find new solutions if one comes in conflict with observations . a theory itself ,",
    "however , is falsifiable if it implies characteristic effects for its solutions even though it may otherwise be ambiguous .",

    "also    the question of whether an effective action for quantum cosmology    exists and what its form is can be addressed .",
    "matter systems : : :    matter systems provide a rich source of diverse scenarios , but a full    analysis is yet to be done .",
    "this includes adding different kinds of    fluids @xcite , fermions or anisotropy parameters ( shear term ) .",
    "all these developments will certainly also aid and suggest developments in the full theory , and reciprocally be assisted by new ideas realized there . at the other side ,",
    "guidance as well as means for testing can be expected from future observations .",
    "we first fix our notation by describing the additional structure provided by a given action of a symmetry group on a space manifold .",
    "this allows us to review the mathematical classification of principal fiber bundles carrying an action of a symmetry group , and their invariant connections .      to describe a theory of connections we need to fix a principal fiber bundle @xmath463 over the analytic base manifold @xmath0 with compact structure group @xmath12",
    "let @xmath464 be a lie symmetry subgroup of bundle automorphisms acting on the principal fiber bundle @xmath465 . using the bundle projection @xmath466 we get a symmetry operation of @xmath165 on @xmath0 .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that all orbits of @xmath165 are of the same type .",
    "if necessary we will have to decompose the base manifold into several orbit bundles @xmath467 , where @xmath468 is the isotropy subgroup of @xmath165 consisting of elements fixing a point @xmath216 of the orbit bundle @xmath469 ( isotropy subgroups for different points in @xmath469 are not identical but conjugate to each other ) .",
    "this amounts to a special treatment of possible symmetry axes or centers .    by restricting ourselves to one fixed orbit bundle we fix an isotropy subgroup @xmath470 up to conjugacy ,",
    "and we require that the action of @xmath165 on @xmath0 is such that the orbits are given by @xmath471 for all @xmath472",
    ". this will be the case if @xmath165 is compact but also in most other cases of physical interest .",
    "moreover , we will have to assume later on that the coset space @xmath473 is reductive @xcite , i.e.  that @xmath474 can be written as a direct sum @xmath475 with @xmath476 . if @xmath165 is semisimple , @xmath477 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath478 with respect to the cartan  killing metric on @xmath474 .",
    "further examples are provided by freely acting symmetry groups , in which case we have @xmath479 , and semidirect products of the form @xmath480 where @xmath481 .",
    "the latter cases are relevant for homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models .",
    "the base manifold can be decomposed as @xmath482 where @xmath483 is the base manifold of the orbit bundle and can be realized as a submanifold @xmath484 of @xmath0 via a section in this bundle . as already noted in the main text ,",
    "the action of a symmetry group on space introduces a partial background into the model . in particular ,",
    "full diffeomorphism invariance is not preserved but reduced to diffeomorphisms only on the reduced manifold @xmath484 . to see what kind of partial background we have in a model",
    "it is helpful to contrast the mathematical definition of symmetry actions with the physical picture .    to specify an action of a group on a manifold one has to give , for each group element , a map between space points satisfying certain conditions",
    "mathematically , each point is uniquely determined by labels , usually by coordinates in a chosen ( local ) coordinate system .",
    "the group action can then be written down in terms of maps of the coordinate charts , and there are compatibility conditions for maps expressed in different charts to ensure that the ensuing map on the manifold is coordinate independent . if we have active diffeomorphism invariance , however , individual points in space are not well - defined .",
    "this leads to the common view that geometrical observables such as the area of a surface are , for physical purposes , not actually defined by integrating over a submanifold simply in parameter form , but over subsets of space defined by the values of matter fields @xcite .",
    "since matter fields are subject to diffeomorphisms just as the metric , area defined in such a manner is diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "similarly , orbits of the group action are not to be regarded as fixed submanifolds , but as being deformed by diffeomorphisms . fixing a class of orbits filling",
    "the space manifold @xmath0 corresponds to selecting a special coordinate system adapted to the symmetry .",
    "for instance , in a spherically symmetric situation one usually chooses spherical coordinates @xmath485 , where @xmath486 labels the orbits and @xmath226 and @xmath227 are angular coordinates and can be identified with some parameters of the symmetry group so(3 ) . in a euclidean space",
    "the orbits can be embedded as spheres @xmath487 of constant curvature .",
    "applying a diffeomorphism , however , will deform the spheres and they are in general only topological @xmath487 .",
    "physically , the orbits can be specified as level surfaces of matter fields , similar to specifying space points .",
    "this concept allows us to distinguish in a diffeomorphism invariant manner between curves ( such as edges of spin networks ) which are tangential and curves which are transversal to the group orbits .",
    "it is , however , not possible to label single points in a given orbit in such a physical manner , simply because we could not introduce the necessary matter fields without destroying the symmetry .",
    "thus we have to use the action of the symmetry group , which provides us with additional structure , to label the points , e.g.  by using the angular coordinates in the example above .",
    "a similar role is played by the embedding of the reduced manifold @xmath484 into @xmath0 by choosing a section of the orbit bundle , which provides a base point for each orbit ( a north pole in the example of spherical symmetry ) .",
    "this amounts to a partial fixing of the diffeomorphism invariance by allowing only diffeomorphisms which respect the additional structure .",
    "the reduced diffeomorphism constraint will then in general require only invariance with respect to diffeomorphisms of the manifold @xmath484 .    in a reduced model ,",
    "a partial fixing of the diffeomorphism invariance does not cause problems because all fields are constant along the orbits anyway . however , if we study symmetric states as generalized states of the full theory , as in sec .",
    "[ s : link ] , we inevitably have to break partially the diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the distributional evaluation of symmetric states and the dual action of basic operators thus depends on the partial background provided by the symmetry .",
    "fields which are invariant under the action of a symmetry group @xmath165 on space @xmath0 are defined by a set of linear equations for invariant field components .",
    "nevertheless , finding invariant fields in gauge theories is not always straightforward since , in general , fields need to be invariant only up to gauge transformations which depend on the symmetry transformation . an invariant connection , for instance , satisfies the equation @xmath488 with a local gauge transformation @xmath489 for each @xmath490 .",
    "these gauge transformations are not arbitrary since two symmetry transformations @xmath491 and @xmath492 applied one after another have to imply a gauge transformation with @xmath493 related to @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "however , this does not simply amount to a homomorphism property and allowed maps @xmath496 are not easily determined by group theory .",
    "thus , even though for a known map @xmath40 one simply has to solve a system of linear equations for @xmath497 , finding appropriate maps @xmath40 can be difficult . in most cases , the equations would not have any non - vanishing solution at all , which would certainly be insufficient for interesting reduced field theories .    in the earlier physical literature , invariant connections and other fields",
    "have indeed been determined by trial and error @xcite , but the same problem has been solved in the mathematical literature @xcite in impressive generality .",
    "this uses the language of principal fiber bundles which already provides powerful techniques .",
    "moreover , the problem of solving one system of equations for @xmath497 and @xmath489 at the same time is split into two separate problems which allows a more systematic approach .",
    "the first step is to realize that a connection whose local 1-forms @xmath497 on @xmath0 are invariant up to gauge is equivalent to a connection 1-form @xmath498 defined on the full fiber bundle @xmath465 which satisfies the simple invariance conditions @xmath499 for all @xmath490 .",
    "this is indeed simpler to analyze since we now have a set of linear equations for @xmath498 alone .",
    "however , even though hidden in the notation , the map @xmath496 is still present .",
    "the invariance conditions for @xmath498 defined on @xmath465 are well - defined only if we know a lift from the original action of @xmath165 on the base manifold @xmath0 to the full bundle @xmath465 . as with maps @xmath496",
    ", there are several inequivalent choices for the lift which have to be determined .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that this can be done by studying symmetric principal fiber bundles , i.e.  principal fiber bundles carrying the action of a symmetry group , independently of the behavior of connections . in a second step ,",
    "one can then ask what form invariant connections on a given symmetric principal fiber bundle have .",
    "we now discuss the first step of determining lifts of the symmetry action of @xmath165 from @xmath0 to @xmath465 .",
    "given a point @xmath472 , the action of the isotropy subgroup @xmath500 yields a map @xmath501 of the fiber over @xmath216 which commutes with the right action of @xmath12 on the bundle .",

    "<S> quantum gravity is expected to be necessary in order to understand situations where classical general relativity breaks down . in particular in cosmology </S>",
    "<S> one has to deal with initial singularities , i.e.  the fact that the backward evolution of a classical space - time inevitably comes to an end after a finite amount of proper time . </S>",
    "<S> this presents a breakdown of the classical picture and requires an extended theory for a meaningful description . </S>",
    "<S> since small length scales and high curvatures are involved , quantum effects must play a role . </S>",
    "<S> not only the singularity itself but also the surrounding space - time is then modified . </S>",
    "<S> one particular realization is loop quantum cosmology , an application of loop quantum gravity to homogeneous systems , which removes classical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> its implications can be studied at different levels . </S>",
    "<S> main effects are introduced into effective classical equations which allow to avoid interpretational problems of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> they give rise to new kinds of early universe phenomenology with applications to inflation and cyclic models . to resolve classical singularities and to understand the structure of geometry around them , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum description is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> classical evolution is then replaced by a difference equation for a wave function which allows to extend space - time beyond classical singularities . </S>",
    "<S> one main question is how these homogeneous scenarios are related to full loop quantum gravity , which can be dealt with at the level of distributional symmetric states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the new structure of space - time arising in loop quantum gravity and its application to cosmology sheds new light on more general issues such as time .    </S>",
