    "secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide a number of opportunities for probing the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "numerous recent and current experiments aim to detect these effects .",
    "the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( tsz ) ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) , which is the inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons due to hot electrons , creates a spectral distortion in the cmb and is the dominant secondary effect contributing to arcminute - scale anisotropies .",
    "the tsz effect arises from the random thermal motion of the electrons .",
    "if there is a finite velocity of the cluster in the cmb frame there will be an additional doppler term .",
    "this doppler anisotropy is called the kinetic sz ( ksz ) distortion .",
    "the tsz effect serves as a powerful tool for probing accumulations of hot gas ( see carlstrom , holder , & reese 2002 for a review ) .",
    "most of the tsz signal comes from galaxy clusters , which contain the majority of the thermal energy of the universe .",
    "state - of - the - art sz surveys like the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) ( hincks et al .",
    "2009 ) and the south pole telescope ( spt ) ( staniszewski et al .",
    "2009 ) aim to detect large numbers of clusters in blind surveys via their sz signatures .",
    "a number of other astrophysical processes will also create both tsz and ksz distortions .",
    "these include ksz distortions from peculiar velocities during reionization ( mcquinn et al .",
    "2005 , illiev et al .",
    "2006 ) , both thermal and kinetic distortions from supernova - driven galactic winds ( white , hernquist , & springel 2002 ; majumdar , nath , & chiba 2001 ) , thermal effect from black hole - seeded proto - galaxies ( aghanim , balland , & silk 2000 ; de zotti et al .",

    "we consider another generic signal : the tsz distortion from hot gas surrounding active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , natarajan & sigurdsson 1999 ; yamada , sugiyama , & silk 1999 ; lapi , cavaliere , & de zotti 2003 ; platania et al .",

    "the sz effect from these sources provides a new observational tool to study the role of baryonic physics in structure formation .",
    "x - ray evidence of the effect of agn feedback on structure formation at different scales has been shown by several groups ( e.g. , mcnamara et al .  2005 ; voit & donahue 2005 ; sanderson , ponman , & osullivan 2006 ; weinmann et al .",
    "2006 ; schawinski et al .",

    ", study of radio jets has illuminated the morphology and outburst history of agns ( e.g. , birzan et al .",
    "2004 ; dunn , fabian , & taylor 2005 ; dunn & fabian 2006 ) .",
    "although effects of agn feedback have been successfully detected on different scales , the challenge lies in quantifying the amount of feedback energy and its particular effects on structure formation .",
    "adding sz ( thermal from now on ) measurements to x - ray data will provide stronger constraints on feedback effects than x - ray data alone ( e.g. , scannapieco , thacker , & couchman 2008 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2008 ; moodley et al .",
    "but the agn signal is tiny , and direct detection through pointed observations with , for example , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) ( lapi , cavaliere , & de zotti 2003 ; chatterjee & kosowsky 2007 ) will be challenging . in this work",
    "we instead cross - correlate cmb maps with optical quasar catalogs ( chatterjee & kosowsky 2007 , scannapieco , thacker , & couchman 2008 ) to enhance the detectability of the sz signal .",
    "the cross - correlation function and its fourier transform , the cross - power spectrum ( peebles 1980 ) , have been powerful techniques in cosmology to probe small signals .",
    "the cross - correlation of cmb data sets with galaxy surveys has proven useful for measuring secondary anisotropies in the cmb ( e.g. , peiris & spergel 2000 ; refregier , spergel , & herbig 2000 ; fosalba , gaztanaga , & castander 2003 ; afshordi , loh , & strauss 2003 ; padmanabhan et al .",

    "this corresponds to a total of 3145728 pixels with each pixel being 47.2 square arc minutes in area . for each frequency band",
    "we use a weighted average of the maps from the individual differencing assemblies ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "sdss has performed 5 band ( ugriz ) photometry ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) over roughly 10000 square degrees of sky area .",
    "we use the quasar catalog developed by ho et al .",
    "the quasars are selected photometrically .",
    "a quasar candidate catalog of uv - excess objects ( @xmath8 ) with observed g magnitudes fainter than 14.5 , extinction corrected g magnitudes brighter than 21.0 , and u - band error less than 0.5 mag are generated ( ho et al .",

    "the candidate quasar catalog is then matched in color space with the dr3-qso catalog ( richards et al .",

    "three additional maps were used to clean the data set from stellar contamination and mask out regions affected by poor seeing : ( i ) a point spread function map ; ( ii ) a stellar density map ( @xmath9 stars smoothed with a 2-degree fwhm ) ; and ( iii ) a stellar surface density map using red stars with @xmath10 greater than 1.4 .",

    "it covers the sky region that lies north of @xmath19 .",
    "the entire survey area is about 82% of the celestial sphere .",
    "the survey catalog includes about @xmath20 discrete objects with a full width half maximum of @xmath21 and a nearly uniform sensitivity . the error in ra and dec varies from @xmath22 for sources with fluxes above 15 mjy to about @xmath23 for sources at the survey flux limit of 2 mjy ( condon et al .",

    ".data set specifications [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to study the possible impact of foreground emission or absorption , we investigate the change in the cross - correlation amplitude when we change thresholds used for each mask .",
    "table 3 shows the effect on the cross - correlation amplitude of changing the threshold of our dust mask .",
    "the signal in the q and v bands varies significantly with the thresholds of the dust mask ; we note that the cross - correlation amplitude increases in these bands ( that is , it becomes more negative ) when we use more restrictive masks .",
    "the signal in the w band is always consistent with noise .",
    "the fact that the cross - correlation signal does not converge with increasingly stringent dust map masks indicates that the observed signal is due to a combination of sz and dust components .",
    "we speculate that some of the actual sz decrement is filled in by dust emission in regions with higher dust . also since dust",
    "will not be correlated with the quasar positions , the mean dust signal contributions to the qso and lrg sample should be comparable . to check this we examined the trend of the signal with the threshold of the dust mask using the randomized sample for both lrgs and qsos .",
    "the results are shown in table 4.0 .",
    "the values for the lrg and qsos are rougly consistent and also we see the correlation value to be high positive ( compared to the other bands ) in w band .",
    "this likely means that the @xmath1-parameters derived here for the two - component fit including dust are closer to the real actual @xmath1-parameters .",
    "our cross - correlation signals are unchanged when the radio mask threshold is changed from 2 mjy to 4 mjy , so the signal likely has no significant radio contamination .",
    "this is further born out because the signal is unchanged if we increase the coverage of the mask to include all wmap pixels within 20 arcminutes of any radio source .",
    "one of the major possible contributors to the cross - correlation signal is an sz distortion from galaxy clusters associated with the qsos .",
    "a number of authors have previously reported evidence of sz distortion in wmap temperature maps ( e.g ; bennett et al .",
    "2003 ; myers et al .  2004 ;",
    "hernandez - monteagudo et al .",
    "2006 ; spergel et al .  2007 ;",
    "diego & partridge 2010 ) , most likely from unresolved galaxy clusters . to estimate the effect from galaxy clusters , we cross - correlate sdss lrgs , which serve as a tracer of galaxy clusters , with the same filtered wmap maps and the same masks used for the qsos .",
    "errors are also calculated in the same way ; the signal has about the same statistical significance as the qso signal . the cross - correlation spectrum is shown in fig .  3 ; the amplitude and shape of the distortion is very similar to the qso case shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the similarity in the cross - correlation spectrum suggests that both the signals might be coming from the same sz source population .",
    "chatterjee et al .  ( 2008 ) shows that the sz signal from qsos will be dependent on redshift due to the time evolution of quasar feedback .",
    "we perform this test by binning the quasars in two redshift slices ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the results do not show any significant evolution with redshift .",
    "cc +    [ spectrum_fig_lrg ]",
    "the sz effect serves as a viable probe for detecting hot gas in agn environments , though the signal is small .",
    "we have presented a first step toward detecting this signal by cross - correlating optical quasar catalogs with microwave maps . at frequencies lower than the null frequency ,",
    "the sz signal is a decrement which makes it unique among other potential signals at those frequencies .",
    "however , oversubtraction of foregrounds can also lead to decrements .",
    "wright et al .  ( 2009 ) , hinshaw et al .  ( 2007 ) , and chen & wright ( 2008 ) report detection of negative fluxes associated with point sources in the wmap 3-year and 5-year point source catalogs . in the present work",
    "we find a deficit in microwave flux associated with both qso s and lrg s from sdss , which suggests sz , but the fits to the observed spectrum are not sufficiently constraining to establish this conclusion definitively .",
    "any sz signal is likely some combination of the signal associated with gas heated by qso s and hot gas in galaxy clusters .",
    "the observed correlation of flux decrement with the lrgs is similar to that for qsos .",
    "this suggests that the sources of the signals might be similar .",
    "lrgs are tracers of galaxy clusters , and hence the sz effect that we observe could be originating from galaxy clusters associated with qsos .",
    "diego & partridge ( 2010 ) have analyzed wmap data by stacking regions around known x - ray clusters , finding an sz signal from galaxy clusters in the range of 10 to 20 @xmath27k , corresponding to tens of mjy .",
    "the mean fluxes we get are of the order of 1 mjy , while the theoretical mean sz signal from quasars is in the range 10 to 100 @xmath27jy , depending on the mass of the black hole ( chatterjee & kosowsky 2007 ; scannapieco , thacker , & couchman 2008 ) .",
    "our signal is at least an order of magnitude higher than the signal that we expect from quasars and an order of magnitude less than what is expected from massive galaxy clusters .",
    "the median redshift of the quasars in our sample is @xmath28 ; quasars at these redshifts tend to reside in halos with masses around a few @xmath29 ( e.g. , coil et al .",
    "2007 ) and not in cluster mass haloes . however , since the cluster sz signal is so much larger than the qso sz signal , our results can be explained if only a small fraction of qso s reside in galaxy clusters .",
    "if 10% of qsos reside in clusters with @xmath30 to @xmath31 halos , they would provide the observed cross - correlation signal .",
    "we made an estimate of the cluster signal from a typical halo mass for qsos @xmath32 and a typical cluster mass @xmath33 by estimating the angular cross correlation function @xmath34 , which will be equal to bias ( qsos ) x bias ( @xmath30 solar mass halos ) x mean dark matter angular correlation function at @xmath35 . to get an estimate of the sz contribution of the cluster signal we need to integrate the correlation function over the beam size which in jy / sr will be,@xmath36(mean cluster sz decrement)@xmath37(angular number density of clusters ) . assuming a beam size of 20 arcminutes for wmap , @xmath38 ( shen et al .",
    "2009 ) , @xmath39 ( estrada et al .",
    "2009 ) , a cluster density of 10 per square degrees ( carlstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) , the angular correlation function estimate at redshift 1.0 ( abell et al .",
    "2009 ) , and a typical sz signal from a cluster to be @xmath40 we get an estimate of the cross - correlation to be @xmath41 .",
    "this number is roughly comparable to our estimates of the cross - correlation .",
    "however this estimate is slightly lower than our detected signal which might imply that some of the power in the signal could be still related to backgrounds .",
    "an alternate possibility is that the sz signal from quasar feedback is higher ( natarajan & sigurdsson 1999 ) than those obtained from current simulations ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2008 ; scannapieco , thacker & couchman 2008 ) .",
    "higher - resolution cmb maps can distinguish between qso and galaxy cluster sz signals by simply resolving the cluster signals ( to all redshifts ) and removing these pixels from any cross - correlation .",
    "experiments which may improve on the current cross - correlation analysis include the planck satellite , with angular resolution down to a few arcminutes in its higher frequency bands , and the ground - based arcminute resolution experiments like act , spt , and apex .",
    "the sz effect is subdominant at angular scales probed by wmap ( e.g. , komatsu & seljak 2002 ; bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) , which will not be the case at higher resolution .",
    "the mean qso sz amplitude is predicted to be on the order of 1 @xmath27k at 150 ghz for an arcminute size beam ( scannapieco , thacker & couchman 2008 ) , with substantial modeling uncertainty .",
    "data from sdss reveal around 30 photometrically detected quasars per square degree .",
    "400 square degrees of sky coverage can provide cross - correlation with around 10000 qso s .",
    "if a ground - based experiment can attain a noise of 10 @xmath27k per pixel over this sky area , this will give roughly a @xmath42 detection of the qso cross - correlation signal and a clear separation of the cluster and qso sz signals .",
    "planck will have 7-arcminute resolution at 143 ghz ; this implies a mean qso sz decrement of around 40 nk per pixel . the noise per pixel after 14 months",
    "is projected to be around 6 @xmath27k .",
    "with around @xmath43 quasars over the full sky , the signal - to - noise of the cross - correlation will be @xmath44 .",
    "note that both of these estimates are for single frequency bands at the maximum decrement .",
    "planck and act in particular are both mapping at frequencies above the null with higher angular resolution , giving stronger statistical constraints but more difficult systematic errors due to possible confusion between the sz increment and foreground emission .",
    "planck s many frequency bands may allow efficient separation of sz from foreground through spectrum information .",
    "we have demonstrated a statistically significant correlation of a temperature decrement in wmap sky pixels with the number density of both quasars and luminous red galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the inferred qso @xmath1-distortion for a two - component fit including both dust and sz gives @xmath45 .",
    "the signal appears to be partly correlated with local dust emission .",
    "higher signal - to - noise measurements are required to separate the dust and sz contributions , while higher spatial resolution will separate qso and galaxy cluster sz signals .",
    "both prospects are likely in the near term with the planck satellite and dedicated ground - based sz measurements .",
    "we anticipate that sz measurements will soon make a valuable contribution to characterizing the energy feedback from quasars , to complement current data from the x - ray and radio bands .",

    "<S> we perform a cross - correlation analysis of microwave data from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe and photometric quasars from the sloan digital sky survey , testing for sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect from quasars . a statistically significant ( 2.5 @xmath0 ) temperature decrement exists in the 41 ghz microwave band . a two - component fit to the cross - correlation spectrum incorporating both dust emission and sz yields a best - fit @xmath1 parameter of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar cross - correlation analysis with the luminous red galaxy sample from sloan gives a best - fit @xmath1 parameter of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible physical origin of these signals , which is likely a combination of sz effects from quasars and from galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> both the planck surveyor satellite and current ground - based arcminute - resolution microwave experiments will detect this signal with a higher statistical significance . </S>"
