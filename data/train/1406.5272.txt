    "thermoelectric materials , which can directly convert heat into electricity and vice versa , have attracted much interest from the science community due to the current critical energy and environmental issues .",
    "the performance of a thermoelectric material is quantified by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath3 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath4 is the absolute temperature , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "a good thermoelectric material should have large seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity , and/or low thermal conductivity . it is challenging to achieve a high @xmath0 value since optimizing one transport coefficient often leads to another adversely affected , which hinders the wide applications of thermoelectric materials .",
    "it is very important to find methods to solve such problem .",
    "nanostructuring@xcite and band convergence@xcite were suggested to be two promising solutions .",
    "the two- or one - dimensional structures could have much larger @xmath0 values than their bulk counterparts , due to the enhanced power factor ( @xmath7 ) caused by a sharper density of states near the fermi level , or the reduced lattice thermal conductivity caused by the increased phonon scattering . on the other hand",
    ", it was found that the conduction or valence band extrema can be modulated and converged by tuning the doping and composition.@xcite such so called band convergence can significantly enhance the seebeck coefficient without detrimental effects on the electrical conductivity .",
    "if we can choose an appropriate material and apply the two methods in it , good thermoelectric performance can be expected .",
    "recently , the single layer of black phosphorus ( black - p ) , the so called phosphorene , was successfully synthesized.@xcite black - p is an elemental solid which is the most stable form among the phosphorus allotropes under normal condition.@xcite similar to graphite , black - p crystallizes in a layered structure , namely , each phosphorus atom is covalently connected to three neighboring phosphorus atoms to form a puckered layer .",
    "it is a direct - gap semiconductor with a band gap of about 0.33 ev.@xcite when the black - p is exfoliated into few or even single layer , extraordinary optoelectronic and electronic properties emerge.@xcite a much larger direct band gap of about 2 ev was found in monolayer phosphorene.@xcite in particular , the nanostructuring can largely enhance the thermoelectric performance : the @xmath0 value of monolayer phosphorene is much larger than that of bulk black - p.@xcite this implies the nanoscale phosphorene - based material can be a good candidate of the applicable thermoelectric material .",
    "very recently , it was reported that the electronic band structure of phosphorene can be tuned by the in - plane@xcite or out - of - plane strains.@xcite this inspires us to investigate whether the band convergence can be introduced into the system by the method of strain .",
    "if so , the thermoelectric performance should be further optimized .    in this work",
    ", we demonstrate that we can direct the conduction band convergence of phosphorene under a simple tensile strain condition , which will greatly enhance the thermoelectric performance of phosphorene .",
    "the effect of the uniaxial strain on the thermoelectric properties of phosphorene is investigated using the first - principles calculations combined with the semi - classical boltzmann transport theory .",
    "our results show that with a moderate tensile strain , the conduction band extrema of phosphorene can be converged , which results in an increase in the seebeck coefficient . at the same time",
    ", the electrical conductivity at a particular direction is dramatically increased and therefore the largely increased power factor is obtained .",
    "when the zigzag - direction strain is applied , the largest @xmath0 value of 1.65 at 300 k is obtained in the zigzag direction of phosphorene at the critical strain of 5% , conservatively estimated by using the bulk lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "the room temperature @xmath0 value can reach 2.12 in the armchair direction of phosphorene under an 8% armchair - direction strain .",
    "the structural and electronic properties of phosphorene are investigated using the first - principles pseudopotential method as implemented in the abinit code.@xcite the brillouin zones are sampled with a @xmath8 monkhorst - pack @xmath9-mesh . the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to be 800 ev . for the structural relaxation , the exchange - correlation energy is in the form of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite with generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "both the geometries and atomic positions are fully relaxed until the force acting on each atom is less than @xmath10 . in the calculations of the electronic structures ,",
    "the tb - mbj potential@xcite is used , which can reproduce accurate band gaps for many semiconductors .",
    "based on the electronic structure , the electronic transport coefficients are derived by using the semi - classical boltzmann theory within the relaxation time approximation@xcite and doping is treated by the rigid band model.@xcite the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath6 is calculated using the wiedemann - franz law @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lorenz number . in this work , we use the lorenz number of @xmath13.@xcite",
    "figure 1 shows the structure of phosphorene , with the top and side views illustrated in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the dashed line denotes the primitive cell used in our calculation , with the corresponding first brillouin zone inserted in the figure . to confirm the reliability of our method",
    ", we first do the calculation for bulk black - p , which has the experimental results to compare with .",
    "the van der waals interactions between the neighboring layers of bulk black - p are treated by the vdw - dft - d2 functional.@xcite the calculated lattice parameters are @xmath14=3.34  , @xmath15=10.51  and @xmath16=4.43  , which are very close to the experimental values.@xcite the bulk black - p is semiconducting with a direct band gap of 0.34 ev at the @xmath17 point , in good agreement with those reported experimentally.@xcite our calculation confirms that the tb - mbj potential can accurately predict the band gap of our investigated system , which is an important factor in determining the electronic transport properties . in the following , we use the same method to deal with the calculations for phosphorene .",
    "the lattice parameters of phosphorene are calculated to be @xmath18=3.32  and @xmath19=4.63  .",
    "the strain is applied along the zigzag or armchair direction of phosphorene , as indicated in fig .",

    "the dashed rectangle denotes the primitive cell , with the corresponding first brillouin zone inserted . ]",
    "first , we discuss the case when the tensile strain is applied along the zigzag direction .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the band structure of phosphorene under the uniaxial strain along the zigzag direction . when no strain is applied ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) , the phosphorene is a direct - band - gap semiconductor with a gap of 1.80 ev located at the @xmath20 point .",
    "the band gap is much larger than that calculated using dft - pbe method ( 0.92 ev)@xcite but is very close to the value calculated by the @xmath21 method ( 2.0 ev).@xcite the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) of phosphorene is highlighted in the red color .",
    "note that there exist the other three band extrema located at the @xmath20 point and along the @xmath20-@xmath22 and @xmath20-@xmath23 directions , respectively , highlighted in the blue color .",
    "the four band extrema are denoted by the symbols",
    " slowromancap1@ \" ,  slowromancap2@ \" ,  slowromancap3@ \" , and  slowromancap4@ \" respectively .",
    "the applied zigzag - direction strain mainly affects the conduction bands of phosphorene . as increasing the strain , the band extremum ",
    "slowromancap3@ \" is gradually lowered while the band extremum ",
    "slowromancap1@ \" is elevated gradually . as for the band extrema",
    " slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap4@ \" , there exists a critical strain , that is , 5% .",
    "when the strain is smaller than 5% , the band extremum ",
    "slowromancap2@ \" is elevated while ",
    "slowromancap4@ \" is lowered as increasing the value of strain .",
    "the band extrema  slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap4@ \" reach their maximum and minimum respectively at the strain of 5% . when further increasing the strain , the band extremum ",
    "slowromancap2@ \" is however lowered and  slowromancap4@ \" is elevated gradually .",
    "the different behavior of the four band extrema leads to the band convergence at the strain of 5% , which is denoted by the dashed green line in fig .",
    "the convergence of the band extrema will in turn lead to the increase in the seebeck coefficient , which will be discussed later .",
    "moreover , when the strain is smaller than 5% , the cbm of phosphorene locates at the @xmath20 point ( see figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) ) ; when the strain reaches 5% , the band extremum  slowromancap3@ \" becomes energetically lower than band extrema ",
    "slowromancap1@ \" ,  slowromancap2@ \" , and  slowromancap4@ \" , and thus the transition of direct - indirect band gap occurs .",
    "when the doping level in the system is low , the electrical conductivity is dominated by the cbm , so we can expect that at the critical strain of 5% , the electrical transport property will be changed dramatically .",
    "we will come back to this point later .      based on the calculated band structure ,",
    "the electronic transport coefficients of phosphorene can be evaluated by using the semi - classical boltzmann theory and rigid band model . to get reliable results , a very dense @xmath9 mesh up to 840 points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) was used . within this method",
    ", the seebeck coefficient @xmath2 can be calculated independent of the relaxation time @xmath24 ; however , the electrical conductivity @xmath3 can only be calculated with @xmath24 inserted as a parameter , that is , what we obtain is @xmath3/@xmath24 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath24 is determined by the formula @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the carrier mobility and @xmath27 is the band effective mass .",
    "the effective mass tensor @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29^{-1}$ ] .",

    "the dp constant @xmath37 along a certain direction is obtained by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the energy of the band edges ( valence band maximum for the holes and conduction band minimum for the electrons ) and @xmath35 is the applied small strain ( by a step of 0.5% ) .",
    "effective mass @xmath27 and carrier mobility @xmath26 of phosphorene at 300 k along ( a ) the zigzag and ( b ) the armchair directions as a function of the applied strain along the zigzag direction . at the critical strain of 5% , the carrier mobility of band extrema  slowromancap1@ \" ,  slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap4@ \" are also denoted by the red stars . ]",
    "the elastic modulus @xmath31 can be obtained by fitting the curve of energy - strain relationship .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath31 in the zigzag direction is 106.18 n / m .",
    "the value is smaller than that of @xmath40 ( about 120 n / m)@xcite and graphene ( about 335.0 n / m).@xcite the dp constant @xmath37 is obtained by the linear fitting of the energy shift of band edges as a function of the strain .",
    "the calculated @xmath37 is 3.98 ev for electrons .",
    "when the uniaxial zigzag - direction strain is applied , the effective mass @xmath27 as well as the corresponding mobility @xmath26 at 300 k in the zigzag and armchair directions are shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "since the strain mainly modulates the bands above the fermi level , we only focus on the properties of electrons .",
    "we can see that for the zigzag direction ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , there is a sharp drop of the effective mass @xmath27 at the critical strain ( 5% ) , which in turn leads to the dramatically increased carrier mobility , with the values about two orders of magnitude larger than those before the critical strain .",
    "note that here the effective mass and mobility are calculated with respect to the cbm ( highlighted in red color in fig .",
    "however , at the critical strain of 5% , the energy difference of the four conduction band extrema is very small , thus except for the cbm , the other three band extrema will also contribute to the electrical conductivity .",
    "the values of the carrier mobility of band extrema  slowromancap1@ \" ,",
    " slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap4@ \" are denoted by the red stars in the fig .",
    "3 . the larger the size of the star , the more it will contribute to the electrical conductivity . after the critical strain , the greatly enhanced mobility and therefore the electrical conductivity will be very beneficial to the thermoelectric application . the trend of the mobility along the armchair direction ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) is just reversed . however , although there is a sharp drop of the mobility at the critical strain , the mobilities after that point are still considerable , larger than 1000 @xmath41 .",
    "the different behavior of the effective mass and carrier mobility in the two different directions upon the applied zigzag - direction strain will in turn influence their thermoelectric properties , which will be discussed later .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     based on the calculated effective mass @xmath27 and carrier mobility @xmath26 , we are now able to obtain the relaxation time @xmath24 . in table",
    "i , we summarize the relaxation time @xmath24 at 300 k along the two different ( zigzag and armchair ) directions of phosphorene when the uniaxial zigzag - direction strain is applied , with the corresponding effective mass @xmath27 and carrier mobility @xmath26 included .",
    "we can see that before the critical strain of 5% , the relaxation times along the armchair direction are much larger than those along the zigzag direction .",
    "however , they become comparable when the strain reaches 5% .        inserting the calculated relaxation time @xmath24 , we plot in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) the room - temperature electrical conductivity @xmath3 as a function of the carrier concentration @xmath42 along the zigzag and armchair directions , respectively , when the different zigzag - direction strains are applied .",
    "when no strain is applied , the electrical conductivity exhibits obvious anisotropic property , with the value along the armchair direction much larger than that along the zigzag direction .",
    "this anisotropic property is due to the different dispersions of the cbm along the @xmath20-@xmath22 ( zigzag direction in the real space ) and @xmath20-@xmath23 ( armchair direction in the real space ) directions .",
    "the band along the @xmath20-@xmath22 direction is much flatter than that along the @xmath20-@xmath23 direction , which results in the much larger band effective mass and therefore much smaller carrier mobility and electrical conductivity in the zigzag direction . for the transport along the zigzag direction , after the critical strain ( 5% ) , the electrical conductivity @xmath3 is obviously enhanced .",
    "if we notice the band structure of phosphorene under the critical strain ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , we can see that the conduction band minimum ( the red line ) which dominates the electrical conductivity moves from the @xmath20 point to the one along the @xmath20-@xmath23 direction .",
    "the effective mass of that band in the zigzag direction is dramatically decreased ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) and table i ) , which results in the largely increased electrical conductivity .",
    "however , in the strain range of @xmath43 , the electrical conductivity under the strain of 5% is the smallest ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , which is consistent with our explanation above that although the mobility of the cbm is the largest at the 5% strain , the other three band extrema  slowromancap1@ \" ,",
    " slowromancap2@ \" and  slowromancap4@ \" will also contribute to the electrical conductivity , which will more or less decrease @xmath3 at that strain .",
    "the electrical conductivity along the armchair direction is however decreased by the strain due to the increased effective mass and therefore the decreased carrier mobility in this direction , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    figures 4(c ) and ( d ) show the seebeck coefficient @xmath2 at 300 k as a function of the carrier concentration along the zigzag and armchair directions , respectively , under the zigzag - direction strain condition .",
    "for both directions , the absolute values of the seebeck coefficients reach the maxima at the critical strain of 5% , where the band convergence is achieved as indicated in fig .",
    "2(c ) . a high seebeck coefficient is often caused by a high overall density - of - states effective mass @xmath44 . the @xmath44 is related to the band effective mass @xmath27 ( i.e. , the effective mass of a single carrier pocket ) by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of the degenerated band valleys",
    ". a large value of @xmath46 will lead to a large @xmath44 , and therefore a large absolute value of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "when the band extrema of the multiple bands have no or little difference in energy ( i.e. , the bands are converged ) , they are considered to be effectively degenerated and @xmath46 is the increased . here , we obtain the band convergence by applying a uniaxial strain and a significantly increased seebeck coefficient is achieved at the critical strain . it has been reported that the convergence of many valleys in bulk materials could be achieved by tuning the doping and composition.@xcite note here that for the zigzag direction and at the critical strain , not only the seebeck coefficient reach the maximum value , but also the electrical conductivity is greatly increased , which will benefit the power factor of phosphorene .",

    "4(e ) ) , the @xmath47 of phosphorene is greatly enhanced when the strain reaches 5% . at relatively higher carrier concentration ,",
    "the phosphorene under 5% zigzag - direction strain has the largest @xmath47 , due to the largest seebeck coefficient @xmath2 and greatly enhanced electrical conductivity @xmath3 .",
    "however , for the armchair direction , although the phosphorene under 5% strain has the largest seebeck coefficient , the electrical conductivity is greatly decreased , which leads to the decrease of the @xmath47 .",

    "the maximum of the @xmath0 value is 50 times larger than that without strain .",
    "applying strain is shown to be an effective way to tune the band structure of phosphorene and the thermoelectric performance in particular direction can be largely optimized .",

    "however , the number of the converged bands is less than that when the zigzag - direction strain is applied . as a result , the enhancement of the @xmath0 value is not as large as the case when the stain is applied along the zigzag direction .",
