    "the earthquake  a sudden stress relief in earth crust  is believed to take place when and where the stress exceeds certain critical value . at the same time",
    ", it is well known that the rock materials are not continuous in physical sense : they consist of grains or crystals of different sizes separated from each other by cracks of all possible sizes .",
    "the picture is more or less the same from the typical grain sizes up to the external size of the seismic zone .",
    "the situation very much resembles that in developed turbulence , described by kolmogorov @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to deal with a system with well manifested self - similarity properties .",
    "the self - similarity of seismic processes has got a lot of attention in phenomenological studies ( see e.  g. @xcite and references therein ) . a theoretical account for self - similarity of earth crust fracturing",
    "was given by newman and knopoff @xcite and some other authors on the base of renormalization approach .",
    "the dynamical modeling of self - similar velocity weakening friction in bk model was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "their hierarchical bk model accounts for cascade rupture propagation and seems to give a simple explanation to the coulomb friction law so widely observed in nature .",
    "however , their model does not account for nonlinear elasticity which is also significant for earth crust deformations @xcite .",
    "the crux of our paper is the direct account of self - similarity ( and scale - dependence , as it will be shown below ) in the spirit of self - similar elasticity @xcite .",
    "taking self - similarity as a given property of the rock material , we have changed the harmonic springs @xmath0 in bk model @xcite to nonlinear ones possessing self - similarity ( to be explained below ) .",
    "we compare our simulations with that of standard bk model @xcite and found our model to be more realistic in the sense of foreshokes and aftershocks clustering@xcite .",
    "besides that , the nonlinear elasticity , which we have yielded from the self - similarity , leads to the nonlinear stiffness of the form @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the length of relaxed spring .",
    "this nonlinearity is adequate to well known empirical fact of nonlinear stiffness of the crust .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in _ section 2",
    "_ we remind the original bk model and analyze its virtues and shortcomings .",
    "the self - similar stiffness modification of bk model is presented in _ section 3_. _ section 4 _ is devoted to the numerical algorithm used for simulations . in _ section 5",
    "_ we compare our model and the original burridge - knopoff one .",
    "the statistical characteristics  autocorrelation function and the hurst exponent  are also presented here . in _",
    "section 6 _ we give some dynamical analysis of the model , which shows that the bk system behaves like a system of kicked oscillators .",
    "there is no mechanical model capable of simulating all the features of real seismic process .",
    "however , to study the temporal characteristics of earthquake dynamics is sufficient to isolate a few main properties of the process .",
    "the feature isolated and put as a basis for the mechanical model of earthquakes was a conjecture that earthquake faults are retarded by nonlinear friction between blocks of rock material .",
    "such a purely dynamical model obeying the newton laws , without any _ ad hoc _ taken random forces , has been proposed by r.  burridge and l.  knopoff 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "the bk system is a system of @xmath3 blocks of mass @xmath4 rested on a rough surface and connected by harmonic springs of stiffness @xmath5 to each other ; each block is attached by a leaf spring of stiffness @xmath6 to moving upper line , see fig .  1 .",

    "the ratio of the two latter parameters @xmath31 is an important parameter of the system , which accounts for the transition from chaotic to solitary wave regime @xcite .",
    "however , in the discrete spring - block model ( [ bk ] ) there is no dependence on the relaxed spring length @xmath2 .",
    "it seems natural on one hand ",
    "the seismic processes are scale - invariant practically at all scales ,  but on the other hand the model admits the possibility of block overlapping , when simulated numerically .",
    "the latter is completely unphysical .",
    "regardless all the merits of spring - block model evidently it does not adequately describe the elastic properties of rock material .",
    "let us consider a spring of relaxed length @xmath2 .",
    "if we contract or dilate it by @xmath32 , we exhibit a reaction force @xmath33 ; where @xmath34 is its stiffness . however , it is absolutely impossible to contract a spring up to zero length , @xmath35 .",
    "more than that , as any geologist knows , in practice @xmath34 is not the same for large contractions and dilations .",
    "more precisely , the stiffness monotonously decreases when going from contractions to dilations , and then , achieving certain critical value , rock crashes .    the simplest way to describe such behavior is to add cubic and quartic terms to spring potential energy @xmath36    however , since we are going to deal with earthquake processes , we also have to account for such a well manifested property of the crust as self - similarity .",
