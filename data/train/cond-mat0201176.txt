    "the discovery of large thermoelectric power in naco@xmath0o@xmath1  ( ref .  ) has made us conscious of the potential of 3@xmath4 transition - metal oxides as thermoelectric materials . since then , many researchers have begun to search for materials that have still better thermoelectric properties . recently , it is reported that ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o and ca@xmath5co@xmath1o@xmath6 also show large thermoelectric power .",

[ covert_h ] , which is a plot of @xmath80 at 2.0  k as a function of the magnetic field , @xmath80 of sample @xmath25=0.51 shows saturating behavior with the magnetic field of 13.2  t. this means that a large part of @xmath85 of sample @xmath25=0.51 shifts towards higher temperature with the magnetic field of 13.2  t , and the magnitude of @xmath85 becomes smaller at 2.0  k. thus , the extrapolation of the data under 13.2  t to zero temperature as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ covert_h ] would give a rough estimate of @xmath82 value of 11.0 mj / mol k@xmath84 .",
    "using the carrier density estimated from the hall coefficient , this @xmath82 gives the effective mass of the present system as 6.9 times larger than that of a free electron , which is ordinary for a transition metal oxide . on the other hand ,",
    "if we estimate @xmath82 of sample @xmath25=0.0 in the same way , it becomes much larger value .",
    "however , this is clearly invalid because @xmath80 of sample @xmath25=0.0 at low temperatures seems to decrease further by the application of stronger magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ covert_h ] . since the ferromagnetic fluctuation is weak in sample @xmath25=0.0 as compared with that in sample @xmath25=0.51",
    ", @xmath53 is less sensitive to the application of the magnetic field .",
    "we have no idea to determine @xmath82 of sample @xmath25=0.0 at present .",
    "however , considering that the arpes spectra at the fermi level are hardly changed by pb doping ,  @xcite @xmath82 of sample @xmath25=0.0 is probably similar to that of @xmath25=0.51 .",
    "consequently , the effective mass of misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o is not enhanced so much in contrast to the case in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this is consistent with the optical reflectivity measurements.@xcite    from these results of specific - heat measurement , it is strongly suggested that misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o has , apart from their origins , localized spin and itinerant carrier with not so heavy mass . based on this picture",
    ", we will discuss the electronic structure of this system .",
    "first , let us consider the origins of the magnetic moments and conductive carriers . as confirmed by the susceptibility measurement ,",
    "about 30% of the co ions have localized moment of @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "hall - coefficient measurement suggests the existence of much smaller number of holes . observed negative magnetoresistance  ( mr ) and anomalous hall effect  ( ahe )",
    "seem to result from the interaction between these localized spins and conductive carriers . according to the recent x - ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopy measurements in misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o ,",
    "@xcite holes exist mainly in @xmath2 orbitals , which are split from @xmath89 orbitals due to trigonal crystal field .",
    "they claimed that these holes form small polarons due to the strong electron - phonon coupling , which serve as localized moments .",
    "this picture is consistent with our susceptibility measurement because the number of localized spins of @xmath88 deduced from the curie constant is near the total number of holes  ( 33% of the number of co ions ) , which is expected from the chemical formula reported by leligny and co - workers .",
    "@xcite thus , the localized magnetic moment is attributable to this @xmath2 hole",
    ".    then the problem is the origin of small number of conducting carriers .",
    "let us compare two possibilities for this below .",
    "the first one is that the band derived from bi - sr - o layer contributes to the conductivity . in bi - based high-@xmath47 cuprates",
    ", band calculation suggests that bi @xmath90 and o @xmath91 mixed band has dispersion at fermi level , which contributes to the conductivity .",
    "@xcite though the bi - sr - o layer is highly insulating in the real system of bscco superconductors , it is possible that this prediction of band theory is realized in misfit - layered bi - sr - co - o due to the difference of the crystal structure between these systems .",
    "however , if carriers originate from the band derived from bi - sr - o layers , it seems strange that they are strongly coupled to localized spins of co ions as observed in negative mr and ahe . since ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o is a misfit - layered compound , bi - sr - o and coo@xmath0 subcells are very weakly coupled to each other",
    ". also , as we reported previously , the transport property changes continuously with pb doping , while the lattice constants of bi - sr - o subcell changes discontinuously near 10% of pb concentration .",
    "@xcite this fact makes the above scenario unfavorable .",
    "the second candidate , which we think more probable , is that carriers exist in the @xmath92 orbitals , which are the other two orbitals split from the @xmath89 triplet and spread along the in - plane direction .",
    "considering that the number of these carriers is expected to be much smaller , and the mass to be lighter than those of @xmath2 holes , a band diagram would be like that shown in fig .",
    "[ bisrco_band ] . at the fermi level",
    ", there are two different bands .",
    "one is , of course , the @xmath2 band , which is responsible for the localized holes due to the strong electron - phonon coupling and this is the majority band .",
    "the other is the @xmath92 band , which touches the fermi level and this band is expected to provide a small number of holes with relatively small mass .",
    "although we do not have a result of the band calculation for this material , a similar electronic structure has been discussed in many other systems with trigonally distorted @xmath60o@xmath93 octahedra  ( @xmath60 : transition metal ) , such as v@xmath0o@xmath5 , ti@xmath0o@xmath5 ,  @xcite and liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite recently , the band calculation for naco@xmath0o@xmath1 has been reported .",
    "@xcite according to that calculation , the @xmath2 band mainly crosses the fermi level .",
    "in addition , the @xmath92 band hybridized with the @xmath2 band also touches the fermi level to make electron pockets .",
    "the band width of the @xmath2 band is smaller than that of the @xmath94 band . of course",
    ", we can not apply this result directly to the present system , especially because the extent of the splitting between the energy levels of @xmath2 and @xmath92 orbitals are very sensitive to the extent of the distortion of the coo@xmath93 octahedra .  @xcite but it seems to be a good starting point to assume this type of light and heavy holes at least for the qualitative discussions .",
    "based on this model , let us consider other properties in the following .    first , we consider the magnetic property . in our previous paper ,",
    "@xcite we explained the observed magnetism by assuming the canted - antiferromagnetic spin structure .",
    "however , some of the results , such as the absence of the anisotropy in the in - plane magnetization or the positive @xmath54 in spite of the assumed antiferromagnetic ground state , have remained unclear . in this paper",
    ", we performed a detailed analysis of temperature and magnetic - field dependence of the specific heat , and come to the conclusion that a different picture more naturally explains all the data including old ones .",
    "it is the coexistence of spin - glass and ferromagnetism .",
    "considering the small magnitude of the abrupt increase of magnetization in the @xmath63 curve  ( 0.06 @xmath95/co ) ,  @xcite a small amount of ferromagnetic cluster with the easy axis of @xmath96 axis is expected to coexist with the spin - glass background .",
    "the coexistence of the clear cusp and large linear term in the specific - heat measurement ( see fig .  [ hc_pbdep ] ) is consistent with this picture .",
    "the anisotropic temperature and magnetic field dependences of the magnetization are explained as follows : clear cusps with the hysteresis observed in the temperature dependence of @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "[ m_t ] or fig .  3 in ref .  )",
    "are attributable to the spin - glass freezing , while the saturating behavior in @xmath99 is attributable to the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "note that @xmath97 and @xmath98 should be isotropic , since the spin glass is isotropic .",
    "the contribution of the spin glass to @xmath99 is probably smeared due to that of the ferromagnetic component . in the m - h curve  (",
    "see fig .",
    "[ mh](c ) or fig .  5 in ref .  ) , the abrupt increase of @xmath99 with weak magnetic field is due to the ferromagnetic component , while the gradual increase at high magnetic field region is due to the alignment of glassy spins by the magnetic field .",
    "the origin of the ferromagnetism is expected to be the double - exchange  ( de ) interaction between localized spins of @xmath2 holes via conducting @xmath92 holes .",
    "this is consistent with the result that the @xmath47 increases with the pb concentration , namely , the enhancement of metallic behavior .",
    "there are , however , still some open questions such as the origin of the spin glass . probably , the randomness due to the dilution of the number of spins and/or misfit - layered structure is essential , but we need to clarify the origin of the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "further study is necessary for this problem and we leave here by summarizing the magnetic property of misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o system in fig .",
    "[ t_c ] , where the data in our previous paper are also included .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath47 and @xmath54 increase with the pb concentration .",
    "although it is difficult to say at which temperature the short - range order starts to develop , we can say , at least , that it starts to develop at higher temperature when the pb concentration is increased .",
    "next , we consider the magnetotransport properties .",
    "the origin of the negative mr is expected to be the de interaction between localized spins of @xmath2 holes via conducting @xmath92 holes .",
    "it is well known that temperature dependent mr induced by the de interaction can be scaled to a universal curve as a function of the magnetization ,  @xcite namely , @xmath100 where @xmath53 is a constant that measures the effective coupling between the itinerant electrons and local spins .",
    "this scaling behavior is observed in perovskite manganites  @xcite and cobalt oxide .",
    "@xcite to check this scaling law , the magnitude of the in - plane negative mr of sample @xmath25=0.51 is plotted as a function of the squared magnetization at various temperatures well above @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ mr_scale ] . both mr and magnetization",
    "are measured under the magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath46 plane .",
    "the scaling holds good at wide range of temperature above @xmath47 .",
    "this result also supports that the de picture is suitable for the present system .",
    "the ahe in this system is basically understood by the scattering of @xmath92 holes by localized spins of @xmath2 holes .",
    "however , the large magnitude and the temperature dependence of @xmath101 are still open questions .",
    "the large magnitude is probably related to the magnetic disorder as in the granular thin films .",
    "@xcite as for the temperature dependence also , we point out a possibility that the presence of spin disorder plays an essential role . recently ,",
    "ahe due to quantal phases in the hopping conduction regime is proposed  @xcite and discussed in la@xmath102sr@xmath103mn@xmath0o@xmath104.@xcite in such theories , the background spin structure of the system plays an essential role for the behavior of the ahe . in the present system , carrier feels the background spin structure through hund coupling .",
    "since spins are disordered and have no periodicity , the quantal phase gained by the carrier is expected to have net contribution to the ahe without being canceled .",
    "this additional contribution may explain the observed increase of @xmath101 down to the lowest temperature in sample @xmath25=0.44 .",
    "finally , we will briefly comment on the thermoelectric power . as is suggested by the reflectivity  @xcite and specific - heat measurements , the mass of carriers in misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o is not enhanced so much , which is in sharp contrast to the case of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "thus , at least in misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o , mass enhancement does not play an essential role for the large thermoelectric power .",
    "the imbalance of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom between low - spin co@xmath105 and co@xmath57 may play an essential role as is theoretically proposed by koshibae and co - workers .",
    "@xcite however , since the carrier density is found to be much lower than that of naco@xmath0o@xmath1  ( @xmath106",
    "@xmath42 ) , the origin of large thermoelectric power in this system may be different from that of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "further study , such as photoemission spectroscopy measurement in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 and ca@xmath5co@xmath1o@xmath6 and comparison with each other is highly desired for the elucidation of the physical property of this system .",
    "we have investigated the transport property , magnetic property , and specific heat in misfit - layered ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o system .",
    "overall magnetism and magnetotransport properties of this system seem to be governed by the disordered nature of the spin system .",
    "the spin structure below @xmath47 is found to be understood more naturally by the coexistence of spin glass and ferromagnetism rather than the canted - antiferromagnetism .",
    "susceptibility measurement confirms the existence of nearly 30% of co@xmath57 among co ions , while the hall coefficient suggests much smaller number of conductive carriers .",
    "they are closely coupled to each other , as is manifested in the magnetotransport phenomenon such as the negative mr and ahe .",
    "specific - heat measurement suggests that the effective mass of the present system is not enhanced so much , which is in sharp contrast to the case of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 and is consistent with the reflectivity measurement reported previously .",
    "we proposed a two - band model to explain these experimental results consistently .",
    "the localized spins and itinerant holes are attributed to different bands : the former originates from @xmath2 orbitals , while the latter does from @xmath92 orbitals .",
    "recently , search for the superconductivity in the related co oxides has been reported .",
    "@xcite though superconductivity has not been observed even under high pressure , it seems of great interest to explore other materials with the same type of triangular lattice , including non - co oxides , and investigate their transport , magnetic and thermal properties .",
    "the authors would like to thank m. takagi , t. tsubone , h. seki , r. shindo , and s. tanaka for their collaboration at the early stage of this work and s. ono and y. ando for their technical advice on transport measurements .",
    "they would also like to thank a. asamitsu , s. hebert , t. kimura , a. maignan , k. miyano , t. mizokawa , n. nagaosa , m. nohara , b. raveau , h. takagi , i. terasaki , and y. tokura for enlightening discussions .",
    "some of the measurements were performed at the cryogenic center of the university of tokyo .",

    ", this assumption is not well justified , because the valence of co is between + 3 and + 4 and the oxygen content would be between + 8 and + 9 .",
    "however , this uncertainty hardly affects the estimated value of @xmath56 because atomic weight of an oxygen is small compared to the total molecular weight .",
    "it is worth while to refer to the possibility of itinerant magnetism .",
    "it is well known that @xmath82 is enhanced by spin fluctuation and @xmath53 is suppressed by the application of the magnetic field as is observed , e.g. , in an itinerant ferromagnet sc@xmath5in.@xcite large @xmath80 at zero field and its suppression by magnetic field of ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o is qualitatively similar to that of sc@xmath5 in .",
    "if the present system can be understood as an itinerant magnet , it may be meaningless to separate electronic and magnetic components of specific heat .",
