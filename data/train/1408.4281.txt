    "the frenet - serret formalism championed by synge for timelike world lines @xcite is a powerful tool for studying the motion of nonzero rest mass test particles in a given gravitational field .",
    "this approach depends only on the geometrical ( i.e. , intrinsic ) properties of the timelike world line of the test particle , independent of any particular coordinate system or observer . in particular it has proven to be very useful in understanding the properties of timelike circular orbits in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and of fermi - walker transport along them , and helps visualize the geometry of this family of orbits .",
    "castagnino @xcite ( under the influence of cattaneo and ferrarese in rome ) extended the frenet - serret approach to null trajectories starting from the original work of cartan @xcite for null curves in a complex 3-dimensional manifold , including the closely associated fermi - walker transport .",
    "his work was soon followed up by bonnor @xcite , who studied null curves in minkowski spacetime using this machinery , and synge @xcite , who returned the discussion to a general spacetime and related the frenet - serret frame to the successive derivatives of the tangent vector to the null curve , and then returned to the topic much later to interpret the natural parametrization of nongeodesic null world lines in terms of observer 3-space quantities @xcite .",
    "urbantke @xcite later generalized bonnor s work to conformally flat spacetimes .",
    "recently the question of fermi - walker transport along null curves has been revisited for vectors orthogonal to the tangent vector of the curve @xcite . in the present article , these topics are reformulated and clarified using the newman - penrose approach @xcite built specifically to deal with null phenomena , and then applied to null killing trajectories in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes . finally parallel transport along null geodesics in any spacetime is examined using these tools .",
    "we follow the conventions of chandrasekhar @xcite with the spacetime signature @xmath0@xmath1@xmath1@xmath1 .    for any frame @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with dual frame @xmath4 defined along a trajectory in spacetime which is characterized by a constant matrix of inner products , i.e. , constant frame components @xmath5 of the metric",
    ", the connection component matrix - valued 1-form evaluated along the tangent @xmath6 to the trajectory ( with respect to some parameter @xmath7 ) e_a/ d= e_b c^b_a  , c^b_a = ^b_a c x^c must be antisymmetric when index - lowered using the metric @xmath8 i.e. , defines a 2-form or equivalently a 2-vector c^= 12 c_a b w^aw^b  , c^= 12 c^a b e_ae_b  , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicate the totally covariant and totally contravariant forms of a tensor @xmath11 obtained by index shifting with the metric .",
    "this 2-form is therefore the generator of a lorentz transformation of the tangent space , although its matrix representation depends on the choice of metric component matrix @xmath12 .",
    "when the first vector @xmath13 is proportional to the tangent to the trajectory and the tangent is timelike , one can introduce successively 3 spacelike vectors defining the curvature properties of the trajectory which form an orthonormal frame for which the greek index notation @xmath14 is more appropriate to distinguish the timelike frame vector from the rest and @xmath15 leading to the usual frenet - serret scenario employed by synge @xcite for various relativistic calculations and modernized by honig , schucking and vishweshwara @xcite , while if the tangent is spacelike , the orthonormal frame which results has a number of possibilities for where the plus sign in the signature falls , but the situation is analogous unless one runs into a null vector in the process of defining the remaining vectors in the frame ( the derivative of a spacelike unit vector must be orthogonal to that vector , but could be spacelike , timelike or null , unlike the timelike case , where the derivative of a timelike unit vector must be spacelike ) .",
    "when the frame is orthonormal , one can decompose the 2-form @xmath16 into its electric and magnetic parts corresponding to the rates of change of the lorentz boost and rotation of the frame relative to a parallel propagated frame along the trajectory .",
    "the corresponding ( mixed ) tensor @xmath17 will generate this family of lorentz transformations .",
    "when @xmath13 is instead a null vector , one can play a similar game but is then led to a a quasi - orthogonal tetrad @xcite , or in more modern language , a real null frame ( or tetrad for dimension 4 ) @xcite , which is facilitated by the newman - penrose formalism based on the closely associated complex null frame .",
    "such a real or complex null frame has a naturally associated orthonormal frame ( related by a simple constant linear transformation ) which can only undergo lorentz transformations along the curve relative to a parallel transported such frame , the mixed tensor @xmath17 will be the generator of a family of lorentz transformations ( whose frame component matrices are related by the same constant linear transformation to the usual component matrices with respect to the orthonormal frame ) .    in the present article",
    "we construct a frenet - serret - like frame adapted to a null world line with tangent along @xmath18 and use the newman penrose formalism to derive a set of equations for the frame vectors in a form similar to eqs .",
    "( [ fseqs ] ) , introducing new intrinsic quantities which play the same role as the more familiar curvature and torsions , leading to a real null frame .",
    "re - examining the study of null world lines in minkowski spacetime undertaken by bonnor @xcite gives some feeling for what these quantities represent .",
    "we then apply the results to study the motion of massless test particles along special orbits in the kerr spacetime , namely along the two repeated principal null directions of the spacetime and along null circular orbits .",
    "the new feature of null curves that few of us have intuition about is that while 2-dimensional circles ( in @xmath19 ) and pseudocircles ( in @xmath20 ) of best fit in the osculating 2-plane are the obvious candidates for comparing the curvature of spacelike and timelike curves respectively ( constant curvature curves in the tangent space which are orbits of killing vector fields associated with the poincare symmetry of that space ) , with null curves one is forced into at least 3 dimensions ( in @xmath21 ) where there are two classes of comparison null curves of constant curvature in the tangent space : null helices and null cubics , with nonzero and zero torsions respectively . in @xmath20 , null curves must be straight since the null cone is 1-dimensional , but in @xmath21 a null vector has  room to move \" on the null cone and so can change direction , corresponding to acceleration , and leads to a 3-dimensional osculating hyperplane describing the local turning motion in @xmath22 .",
    "although there is a long history of studying the geometry of null curves in lorentzian spacetimes , little of this seems to have entered the more mainstream knowledge base of general relativity .",
    "coupled with the fact that the null rotations which their tangent vectors may undergo relative to parallel transport ( in addition to the usual familiar rotations ) are also less known intuitively , the topic has remained sidelined .",
    "given a single timelike test particle world line with some parametrization @xmath23 and corresponding tangent @xmath24 with squared length @xmath25 , one may reparametrize it by the proper time along the world line @xmath26 .",
    "this parametrization is defined modulo an initial value , i.e. , up to an additive constant .",
    "the spacetime frenet - serret frame with unit tangent ( 4-velocity ) @xmath27 , is then described by the following system of evolution equations @xcite @xmath28 this corresponds to the matrices @xmath29 and ( c^ _ ) =  , ( c^ ) =  . making the obvious decomposition @xmath30 into curvature and torsion parts ( the electric and magnetic parts of the corresponding covariant or contravariant tensors ) , the associated contravariant tensor is the sum of two simple bivectors c_^= e_1e_0 = au  , c_^= ( _ 1 e_1 - _ 2 e_3)e_2  , the first of a timelike and spacelike vector generating a family of boosts in the plane of the two and the second of two spacelike vectors generating a rotation in their plane .",
    "the absolute value of the curvature @xmath31 is the magnitude of the acceleration @xmath32 , while the first and second torsions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the components of the frenet - serret angular velocity vector obtained by taking the spatial dual of the bivector @xmath35 [ omegafs ] _",
    "( fs)=_1 e_3 + _ 2 e_1  , ||_(fs)||=[_1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2]^1/2  .",
    "the latter determines the angular velocity of rotation of the spatial frenet - serret frame @xmath36 and the acceleration determines the rate of change of the boost of this frame relative to a parallel transported frame along @xmath37 according to = _ ( fs)e_i+e_0 ^",

    "all frenet - serret curvature and torsions are constant and the problem of evaluating such a frame has been explicitly solved by iyer and vishveshwara @xcite .",
    "one can then evaluate the parallel transport along the world line using the matrix exponential @xcite .",
    "the invariants of the matrix @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where ( ^*c^ ) = ( 12 ^c _ ) =  .",
    "here invariance means that under lorentz transformations of the tangent space which map the given frenet - serret orthonormal frame to any other such orthonormal frame , this component matrix transforms under a lie algebra adjoint transformation but these invariants do not change and so can be used to classify the orbits of the lie algebra into equivalence classes .",
    "the vanishing or nonvanishing of these two lorentz invariants classifies the type of lorentz transformation they generate @xcite . for nongeodesics ( @xmath41 ) , the vanishing or nonvanishing of the second invariant",
    "@xmath42 is equivalent to the vanishing or nonvanishing of @xmath34 , in which case the generators are called singular / semi - singular or general ( nonsingular ) respectively .",
    "general lorentz generators generate a lorentz 4-screw : a rotation in one spacelike 2-plane and a boost in an orthogonal timelike 2-plane , while semi - singular generators correspond to either a pure rotation or boost alone in a spacelike or timelike 2-plane respectively and singular generators correspond to a null rotation in a timelike 3-plane .",
    "the reciprocal of the curvature @xmath31 defines a radius of curvature @xmath43 . for a spacelike curve with a spacelike first normal , this is associated with an osculating circle of radius @xmath44 in the tangent space whose center is a distance @xmath44 along the first normal @xmath13 . for a timelike curve being considered here , this is instead associated with an osculating pseudocircle ( hyperbola ) in the tangent space whose center is a distance @xmath44 along @xmath45 . for a null curve ,",
    "one is forced into at least a 3-dimensional subspace of the tangent space ( the osculating hyperplane ) where our intuition must be extended by studying the simplest constant curvature null curves in @xmath21 .    the matrix @xmath46 ( correspondingly the tensor @xmath47 ) determines the parallel transport of vectors along the world line when expressed in terms of frame components @xmath48 x^/= x^/+ c^_x^= 0  .",
    "it consists of the sum of two parts @xmath30 , the first associated with the curvature , which is responsible for boosting @xmath49 away from a parallel transported direction , and one associated with the two torsions , which are responsible for the rotation of the plane perpendicular to the plane of the motion determined by @xmath50 .",
    "fermi - walker transport along the world line is obtained from parallel transport by removing the boost piece of the parallel transport to allow the tangent vector to remain tangent to the world line and allow the local rest space of the timelike observer to stay orthogonal to the world line under the new transport .",
    "in other words the new transport should only boost vectors in the plane of the tangent and its derivative ( velocity acceleration plane ) relative to parallel transport to realign the timelike direction with the tangent to the curve and nothing more .",
    "fermi - walker transport of a vector is therefore defined by _ ( fw )",
    "x^/= x^/- c_^_x^= 0  , or x^/= ( a^u_- u^a _ ) x^  .",
    "this transport thus ignores the changing direction of @xmath37 ( it has zero fermi - walker derivative ) and only measures the rotation of the frame in the local rest space of @xmath37 orthogonal to the direction of the motion in spacetime .",
    "one final remark is in order before moving on to the null case .",
    "the first frenet - serret equation for an arclength parametrized curve with everywhere nonvanishing curvature in a riemannian 3-manifold with frenet - serret frame @xmath36 , namely e_1/s = e_2 e_1/= e_2  if   /s =  , suggests an alternative parametrization of the world line by a turning angle parametrization , namely by the angle of rotation of the unit tangent in the osculating plane relative to projected parallel transport ( most familiar in the plane curve scenario in @xmath19 @xcite , and whose integral over a closed plane curve is the analog of the gauss - bonnet theorem in that setting ) . in terms of a general initial parametrization , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 so that @xmath54 is the magnitude of the transverse acceleration if @xmath7 is interpreted as the classical mechanical time , equal to the angular velocity of the unit tangent and unit normal in the osculating plane . from either starting point , in the new parametrization",
    "this makes the coefficient of the unit normal @xmath19 in this serret - frenet equation identically 1 along the curve , apparently first introduced by vessiot @xcite ( according to bonnor @xcite ) who referred to it as the pseudo - arclength , loosely translated .",
    "for an everywhere accelerated timelike world line in a spacetime , the corresponding situation instead leads to a boost angle ( rapidity ) parametrization of the world line .    in the null case , however , without a way to fix the parametrization defining @xmath55 by a normalization condition as can be done in the nonnull case , the curvature defined by @xmath56 acquires two factors of @xmath57 in its transformation , and furthermore the curvature and torsions no longer have a parametrization independent meaning , with the coefficient of @xmath19 transforming like a second derivative modulo projection instead of transforming by one factor of @xmath57 in the nonnull case , where the curvature itself is already invariantly defined by a quotient of the coefficient of @xmath19 in that equation by @xmath58 .",

    "of course if @xmath18 is a geodesic , the construction of the frenet - serret frame breaks down , but then one can simply choose an adapted quasi - orthogonal frame along the world line , characterized only by the torsions . when a single geodesic is part of a family of nongeodesic world lines , it inherits a limiting frenet - serret frame by continuity , when such a limit exists .",
