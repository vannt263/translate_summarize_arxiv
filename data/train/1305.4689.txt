    "quantized vortices are topological defects in a superfluid , possessing quantized circulation of the superfluid around them .",
    "they play an important role in the transport phenomena in the superfluid such as the critical superflow and quantum turbulence  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they are responsible for the superfluid phase transition in two dimensions , where pairing of vortices with opposite circulation occurs below a critical temperature  @xcite . in ultracold atom experiments , quantized vortices and related phenomena have been actively studied  @xcite .",
    "they were first observed in rotating bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and many aspects of their dynamic behavior have been investigated , including line defect deformation  @xcite , instability of multiply charged vortices  @xcite , and vortex dipole dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , thermally activated vortices have been observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose gases  @xcite .    at the core of a quantized vortex",
    ", superfluid density is depleted because of the diverging centrifugal potential .",
    "this distinctive feature is typically used for detecting the quantized vortices . in a trapped bec , however , the spatial extent of the vortex core , which is determined by the healing length of the condensate , is generally smaller than the wavelength of imaging light , and so its _ in situ _ optical detection is experimentally challenging . a conventional method to circumvent this difficulty is releasing the trap to let the condensate freely expand , where the vortex core also expands .",
    "free expansion of a bec containing a quantized vortex was theoretically studied , showing that the vortex core may expand faster than the condensate during the initial stage of the expansion  @xcite , and further faster in the case of an oblate bec  @xcite .    in this paper , we study expansion dynamics of a quasi-2d , _ i.e. _ highly oblate bec containing quantized vortices . because the condensate expands fast along the tight confinement direction at the beginning of the free expansion , the atomic density and consequently the atom - atom interaction effects rapidly reduce in the expanding condensate .",
    "for this sudden quenching of the interactions , the density - depleted vortex core , which is maintained to be small in the trapped condensate by the interactions , will evolve differently from that in three - dimensional hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "we observe that the ring - shaped density ripples develop surrounding the vortex core in a freely expanding quasi-2d condensate and find that their time evolution is quantitatively well described by numerical simulations assuming no interactions .",
    "finally , we investigate the defocus effect in imaging of the vortex core , which is caused by the free fall of the condensate during the expansion time .",

    ", we intentionally displace the optical trap from the center of the plugged magnetic trap by about @xmath9 m in the horizontal direction , and carry out a rapid transfer of the condensate to the optical trap .",
    "the transfer is made by ramping up the optical trap and simultaneously ramping down the magnetic potential for 500  ms . during this transfer",
    ", the optical plug beam is kept on to let the condensate experience an obstacle as it flows into the optical trap . finally , the plug beam is linearly turned off for 400  ms .",
    "free expansion is initiated by suddenly turning off the optical trap , and the column density distribution is measured by taking an absorption image along the @xmath3 axis after an expansion time @xmath10 .    right after being transferred into the optical trap , the condensate showed very complicated and random density modulations in expansion , indicating that it was strongly perturbed in the transfer process  @xcite .",
