    "the driven burgers equation @xmath12 with a force @xmath13 has a much richer structure than the decaying problem with @xmath14 . indeed , by the hopf ( 1950 ) and",
    "cole ( 1951 ) transformation the latter is mapped into the heat equation , while the former goes into a kind of imaginary - time schrdinger equation with a potential @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "actually , the randomly forced burgers equation appears in a number of problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "this includes the kardar , parisi & zhang ( 1986 ) equation for interface dynamics ( see also barabsi & stanley 1995 ) and the problem of directed polymers in random media ( bouchaud , mzard & parisi 1995 ) .    from the point of view of turbulence dynamics , the forced burgers equation can be used in the same spirit as the forced navier  stokes equation , namely to investigate universality with respect to the forcing of various statistical properties . for navier",
    " stokes turbulence , when the force is confined to large spatial scales and the reynolds number is very high , small - scale ( inertial range ) statistical properties are generally conjectured not to depend on the forcing , except through overall numerical factors .",
    "similar conjectures have been made for burgers turbulence with large - scale forcing .",
    "for example , there is little doubt that , because of the presence of shocks , all the structure functions of order @xmath17 have a universal exponent equal to unity ( see , e.g. , bouchaud , mzard & parisi 1995 ; e _ et al_.  1997 ) .",
    "chekhlov & yakhot ( 1995 ) were the first to study the behavior of the probability density function ( pdf ) of velocity increments when the force is a white - noise process in time and has a @xmath18 spectrum , a case leading to anomalous scaling .",
    "when the force is a white - noise process in time but is confined to large scales , the behavior of the pdf @xmath19 of the velocity gradient @xmath20 at large negative values is rather controversial .",
    "if it is generally believed that this pdf follows a power law , @xmath21 the conjectured values of @xmath22 differ markedly .",
    "polyakov ( 1995 ) and boldyrev ( 1997 ) , using a field - theoretical operator product expansion , predict @xmath23 ; e _ et al_.  ( 1997 ) , using a semi - heuristic approach in which nascent shocks ( preshocks ) are key , predict @xmath24 ; gotoh & kraichnan ( 1998 ) , using a fokker  planck equation approach , predict @xmath25 ; more recent work by kraichnan ( 1999 ) favors @xmath24 .",
    "e & vanden eijnden ( 1999 , 2000 ) develop a probabilistic formalism that copes with the delicate problems arising in the limit of vanishing viscosity when shocks are present , prove that @xmath26 and make a good case for @xmath24 .",
    "the question of the correct law for the case of white - noise forcing remains however open ( we shall come back to this in  [ s : conclusion ] ) .",
    "there are simpler situations for which the arguments in favor of @xmath24 , originally developed by e _ et al_.  ( 1997 ) , can be made rigorous , such as one- and multi - dimensional decaying burgers turbulence with smooth random initial conditions ( bec & frisch 2000 ; bec , frisch & villone 2000 ) .",
    "it may be thought that numerical experimentation on the one - dimensional forced burgers equation should be able to easily obtain the correct scaling laws .",
    "this is actually rather difficult if one tries to use standard numerical schemes of the kind also applicable to the navier  stokes equation , such as spectral methods with dissipation explicitly taken into account .",
    "indeed , it has been shown by gotoh & kraichnan ( 1998 ; see also gotoh 1999 ) that , in the presence of a small but finite viscosity , there is a range of large negative values of the gradient for which the pdf @xmath27 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic - tangent internal structure of shocks . as a result ,",
    "the behavior of the pdf at negative values of @xmath20 smaller in absolute value is contaminated and may display power laws somewhat shallower than predicted by the theory in the inviscid limit . see , for example , figure  3 of gotoh & kraichnan ( 1998 ) in which a power - law range with exponent -3 is seen over a little more than one decade of @xmath20-values .",
    "such artefacts will disappear if much higher resolution is used ( gotoh and kraichnan were using between @xmath28 and @xmath29 collocation points ) .",
    "it is , however , much more efficient to use alternative numerical schemes where one works directly with the inviscid limit .",
    "we shall see that such schemes , which were previously used only for the decaying case can be readily extended to the forced case and are particularly well suited for the case of kicked burgers turbulence , in which the force is concentrated at discrete times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : kicked ] introduces the general concept of kicked burgers turbulence and gives an explicit representation of the solution which is a simple generalization of the so - called `` minimum representation '' for the decaying case .",
    "section  [ s : minimizer ] presents the concepts of `` minimizers '' and `` main shocks '' for the case when the dynamics are started at @xmath30 .",
    "section  [ s : numerical ] presents the fast legendre transform numerical scheme for space - periodic kicked burgers turbulence with spatially smooth forcing .",
    "the next two sections are about the case of deterministically kicked burgers turbulence when the kicks are periodic in space and time .",
    "section  [ s : periodic ] presents numerical results on exponential convergence to a periodic solution and shows how this is related to properties of minimizers ( the rigorous results on convergence to a unique periodic solution are derived in the appendix ) .",
    "section  [ s : statistical ] presents the main results about pdf s of velocity derivatives and increments (  [ s : pdf ] ) and about structure functions (  [ s : structure ] ) . section  [ s : conclusion ] presents concluding remarks and some possible extensions to navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "we shall be concerned here with the initial - value problem for the one - dimensional burgers equation ( [ burgers ] ) when the force is concentrated at discrete times : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the dirac distribution and where both the `` impulses '' @xmath2 and the `` kicking times '' @xmath1 are prescribed ( deterministic or random ) .",
    "the kicking times are ordered and form a finite or infinite sequence . in this paper the impulses are always taken smooth and acting only at large scales .",
    "newman & mckane ( 1997 ) have used similar kicking , but confined to small scales , in a context where the forced burgers equation is used for the study of directed polymers .",
    "kraichnan ( 1999 ) has considered a simple model in which there are non - smooth impulses creating directly sawtooth profiles in the velocity .",
    "the precise meaning we ascribe to the burgers equation with this forcing is that at time @xmath1 , the solution @xmath33 changes discontinuously by the amount @xmath2 @xmath34 while , between @xmath35 and @xmath36 the solution evolves according to the unforced burgers equation . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that the earliest kicking time is @xmath37 , provided we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear that any force @xmath13 which is continuously acting in time can be approximated in such a way by choosing the kicking times sufficiently close .",
    "we shall also make use of the formulation in terms of the velocity potential @xmath41 and the force potentials @xmath42 @xmath43 the velocity potential satisfies @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial potential .",
    "as it is well - known , the solution to the _ unforced _ burgers equation with positive viscosity @xmath46 , has an explicit integral representation obtained by hopf ( 1950 ) and cole ( 1951 ) which can be used to investigate the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "we are here exclusively interested in this limit .",
    "generically , shocks appear then after a finite time from smooth initial data .",
    "( the correct solution may also be obtained by solving the inviscid equation with a variational formulation and the condition that , at a shock , the right velocity is less than the left velocity ( lax 1957 ; oleinik 1957 ) . )",
    "use of laplace s method then leads to the following `` minimum representation '' for the potential in the limit of vanishing viscosity ( henceforth always understood ) which relates the solutions at any two times @xmath47 between which no force is applied : @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{maxunforced}\\ ] ] it is known that , when @xmath49 is the initial time , the position @xmath50 which minimizes ( [ maxunforced ] ) is the lagrangian coordinate associated to the eulerian coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "the map @xmath52 is called the lagrangian map . by expanding the quadratic term it is easily shown that the calculation of @xmath53 from @xmath54 is equivalent to a legendre transformation . for details on all these matters ,",
    "see she , aurell & frisch ( 1992 ) and vergassola _",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ) .",

    "note that this representation , which actually goes back to work by oleinik ( 1957 ) on general conservation laws , is just a continuous limit of ( [ maxkicked])-([defa ] ) , obtained by taking @xmath67 and letting @xmath68 .",
    "returning to the case of kicked burgers turbulence , from ( [ maxkicked ] ) , we shall now introduce the concept of `` minimizers '' and `` main shock '' (  [ s : minimizer ] ) .",
    "( [ maxkicked ] ) will also be our starting point for the numerical method (  [ s : numerical ] ) .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we shall assume that _ the force potential and the initial condition are periodic in the space variable .",
    "_ for convenience , the period is taken to be unity in the theory , while @xmath69-periodicity is assumed in numerical studies .      for the case of the kicked burgers equation with an initial condition at @xmath70 a `` minimizing sequence '' associated to @xmath71",
    "is defined as a sequence of @xmath72 s ( @xmath73 ) at which the r.h.s . of ( [ maxkicked ] )",
    "achieves its minimum .",
    "differentiating the action ( [ defa ] ) with respect to the @xmath72 s one gets necessary conditions for such a sequence , which can be written as a sequence of ( euler  lagrange ) maps @xmath74 where @xmath75 these equations must be supplemented by the initial and final conditions : @xmath76 it is easily seen that @xmath77 .",
    "observe that the `` particle velocity '' @xmath78 is the velocity of the fluid particle which arrives at @xmath72 at time @xmath1 and which , of course , has remained unchanged since the last kick ( in lagrangian coordinates ) .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) just expresses that the particle velocity changes by @xmath79 at the the kicking time @xmath1 .",
    "note that ( [ map1])-([map2 ] ) define an area - preserving and ( explicitly ) invertible map .",
    "the presence of a force , deterministic or random , allows a formulation of the burgers equation in the semi - infinite time interval @xmath80-\\infty , t]$ ] without fully specifying the initial condition @xmath81 but only its ( spatial ) mean value @xmath82 .",
    "heuristically , this follows from the observation that , for a force of zero spatial mean value , as assumed here , @xmath83 is a first integral , and hence does not depend on time , while all the other information contained in the initial condition is eventually forgotten .",
    "actually , the construction of the solution in a semi - infinite time interval is done by extending the concept of minimizing sequence to the case of dynamics starting at @xmath30 . for a semi - infinite sequence @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , let us define the action @xmath86 by ( [ defa ] ) with @xmath87 .",
    "such a semi - infinite sequence will be called a `` minimizer '' ( or `` one - sided minimizer '' ) if it minimizes this action with respect to any modification of a finite number of @xmath72 s . specifically , for any other sequence @xmath88 which coincides with @xmath84 except for finitely many @xmath89 s ( i.e.  @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) , we require @xmath92    of course , the euler  lagrange relations ( [ map1])-([map2 ] ) still apply to such minimizers .",
    "hence , if for a given @xmath51 and @xmath56 we know @xmath33 we can recursively construct the minimizer @xmath84 backwards in time by using the inverse of ( [ map1])-([map2 ] ) for all @xmath93 and the final condition  now an initial condition  ( [ mapfin ] ) with @xmath94 .",
    "this is well defined except where @xmath33 has a shock and thus more than one value .",
    "actually , solutions in a semi - infinite time interval are constructed from minimizers and not the other way round .",
    "one way to construct minimizers is to take a sequence of initial conditions at different times @xmath95 . at each such time",
    "some initial condition @xmath81 is given with the only constraint that it have the same prescribed value for @xmath83 .",
    "then , ( finite ) minimizing sequences extending from @xmath96 to @xmath56 are constructed for these different initial conditions .",
    "this sequence of minimizing sequences has limiting points ( sequences themselves ) which are precisely minimizers ( e _ et al_.  2000 ) .",
    "the uniqueness of such minimizers , which would then imply the uniqueness of a solution to burgers equation in the time interval @xmath80-\\infty , t]$ ] , can only be shown by using additional assumptions , for example for the case of time - periodic forcing (  [ s : periodic ] and appendix ) .    if @xmath97 , the sequence @xmath84 minimizes the action @xmath86 in a stronger sense .",
    "consider any sequence @xmath88 such that , for some integer @xmath98 we have @xmath99 , @xmath100 and which differs arbitrarily from @xmath84 for @xmath101 .",
    "( in other words , in a sufficiently remote past the hatted sequence is just shifted by some integer multiple of the spatial period . ) we then have @xmath102 indeed , for @xmath97 , the velocity potential for any initial condition is itself periodic . in this case",
    "a particle can be considered as moving on the circle @xmath103 and its trajectory is a curve on the space - time cylinder .",
    "the @xmath72 s are now defined modulo  1 and can be coded on a representative @xmath104 .",

    "the condition of minimality implies now that @xmath72 and @xmath105 are connected by the shortest possible straight segment .",
    "it follows that @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the distance on the circle between the points @xmath108 , namely @xmath109 .",
    "hence , the action @xmath110 can be rewritten in terms of cyclic variables : @xmath111 .",
    "\\label{actionz}\\ ] ]    we now introduce the concept of `` global minimizers '' ( or `` two - sided minimizers '' ) limiting ourselves to the case @xmath97 for simplicity .",
    "we first observe that any minimizer @xmath112 can be continued for all @xmath113 and hence times @xmath114 by using the system ( [ map1])-([map2 ] ) .",
    "however , this procedure , when extended too far in time , will not usually generate a minimizer associated to time @xmath49 .",
    "nevertheless , for any time @xmath56 there always exist positions @xmath51 such that the corresponding minimizers @xmath115 can be continued to the bilateral sequence @xmath116 while keeping the minimizing property .",
    "such global minimizers correspond to trajectories of fluid particles which , from @xmath117 to @xmath118 , have never been absorbed in a shock .",
    "we then observe that any shock existing at time @xmath56 can be continued for all times @xmath119 : shocks can merge but they can not otherwise disappear .",
    "however , since new shocks can be produced , it is not always possible to trace back an existing shock for arbitrary times @xmath120 .",
    "a shock with this property of having always existed in the past is called a `` main shock '' .    in e _ et al_.  ( 2000 ) it is shown that for the case of random forcing which is @xmath121-periodic in space and white noise in time rather than impulsive , the solution of burgers equation in @xmath80-\\infty , t]$ ] is unique for @xmath97 .",
    "it is also shown that at time @xmath56 , the set of points @xmath122 with more than one minimizer , that is shock locations , is finite and that the main shock and the global minimizer are unique .",
    "the global minimizer forms a hyperbolic trajectory of the euler - lagrange equations and all other minimizers approach the global one , as @xmath123 exponentially fast .",
    "in particular the two minimizers associated to the main shock approach the global minimizer in the remote past but it may be shown that they do so from opposite directions on the circle @xmath103 .",
    "we shall see below in ",
    "[ s : periodic ] that the same picture holds in the case of generic time - periodic kicking .",
    "the numerical method used here solves the kicked burgers equation directly in the inviscid limit .",
    "the basic ideas are very simple : at each kicking time @xmath1 the potential is changed by the amount @xmath42 ; between two successive kicks ( or between the last kick and the output time ) the decaying burgers equation is solved using the minimum representation ( [ maxunforced ] ) ; this procedure is repeated as many times as the number of kicks between the initial time and the output time .",
    "specifically , the space periodic interval , here taken to be @xmath124 , is discretized on a regular grid of @xmath125 collocation points @xmath126 . for each of these positions , ( [ maxunforced ] )",
    "is used to determine the potential at a time @xmath56 in terms of the potential just before the last kicking time @xmath57 , time at which the potential has discontinuously changed by @xmath127 .",
    "hence , we have  : @xmath128 , \\label{maxflt}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the value of the velocity potential at @xmath130 , just before the kick .",
    "we note @xmath131 the minimizing position corresponding to @xmath132 .",
    "this procedure is , in principle , applied recursively , starting from @xmath70 .",
    "the problem is that naive application of ( [ maxflt ] ) yields an algorithm with @xmath133 operations between two successive kicks .",
    "she , aurell & frisch ( 1992 ) observed that the minimizing position @xmath50 is actually a monotonic non - decreasing function of @xmath51 .",
    "this is indeed a simple consequence of the convexity of the parabolic term involved in ( [ maxunforced ] ) .",
    "hence , the determination of the @xmath131 s can be performed using a binary - subdivision search which requires only @xmath134 operations .",
    "this kind of algorithm is known under the name fast legendre transform ( flt ) , since the minimum representation is equivalent to a legendre transform ( hopf 1950 ) .",
    "( an even faster algorithm requiring only @xmath135 operations has been developed by trussov ( 1996 ) . )",
    "we use an adaptation of the method of noullez and vergassola ( 1994 ; see also vergassola _",
    "et al_.  1994 ) who developed an flt algorithm using a binary - subdivision search combined with a reorganization of the search , permitting the use of very low in - core storage .",
    "we first determine the minimizing @xmath136 for the point @xmath137 . as the velocity - potential at the time @xmath138 is periodic , it is easy to show that @xmath136 is within the interval @xmath139 .",
    "the minimizing location corresponding to @xmath140 is then given by periodicity and reads @xmath141 .",
    "the search for all the other minimizing locations @xmath131 can then be restricted to indices @xmath142 such that @xmath143 .",
    "we then compute @xmath144 , corresponding to @xmath145 .",
    "we can then further subdivide the @xmath51-interval by considering @xmath146 and @xmath147 , for which the corresponding @xmath142 s satisfy @xmath148 . at the next stage ,",
    "we compute @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 for which we need @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 as search boundaries .",
    "we repeat this subdivision procedure @xmath157 times to obtain the @xmath125 values of @xmath131 .",
    "the method just described is optimal for non - smooth solutions of the kind considered by vergassola _ et al_.  ( 1994 ) who had initial conditions of brownian type . for the case of smooth solutions considered here ,",
    "a more accurate determination of the solution is required to obtain reliable results on space derivatives of the velocity .",
    "we now describe an improvement of the method allowing to calculate first- and second - order derivatives .",
    "we observe that in ( [ maxflt ] ) , when the discrete location @xmath158 is replaced by an arbitrary real number @xmath50 , the minimum , for a given @xmath132 is , in general , not achieved exactly on the grid at @xmath131 , but at a neighboring location @xmath159 within less than one mesh .",

    "this flt , implemented on a grid of @xmath163 collocation points takes about 1s of cpu on a 100mflops computer . without use of the binary - subdivision search",
    "the cpu time would be several thousands times larger . among the other advantages of flt",
    "is that no viscosity is needed and that the solution can be calculated directly at the required output times without need to obtain it at many intermediate times ( other than the kicking times ) .",
    "from now on we shall consider exclusively the case where the kicking is periodic in both space and time . specifically",
    ", we assume that the force in the burgers equation is given by @xmath164 where @xmath165 , the kicking potential , is a deterministic function of @xmath51 which is periodic and sufficiently smooth ( e.g.  analytic ) and where @xmath166 is the kicking period .",
    "the initial potential @xmath167 is also assumed smooth and periodic .",

    "( in this paper , we limit ourselves to cases presenting at least one new shock between successive kicks . )",
    "the latter potential gives essentially the same results as reported hereafter but has an additional symmetry which we avoided by the choice ( [ defg ] ) .",
    "the number of collocation points chosen for our simulations is generally @xmath172 , with a few simulations done at @xmath173 ( for the study of the relaxation to the periodic regime presented below ) . since our numerical method allows us to go directly to the desired output time ( from the nearest kicking time )",
    "there is no need to specify a numerical time step . however , in order to perform temporal averages , e.g.  when calculating pdf s or structure functions , without missing the most relevant events ( which can be sharply localized in time ) we need sufficiently frequent temporal sampling .",

    ", we just explain the main ideas of the proof and give some additional properties of the unique solution .",
    "one very elementary property of solutions is that , for any initial condition of zero mean value , the solution after at least one kick satisfies @xmath182 .",

    "obviously , the method of forcing by kicks applied at discrete instants of time can also be used for navier  stokes .",
    "one of the things which made this method particularly valuable for the burgers case is the existence of an efficient numerical algorithm to solve the purely decaying burgers equation in the inviscid limit . at the moment",
    "there is nothing comparable for navier  stokes .",
    "note that periodic kicking will not result in a unique time - periodic solution for navier ",
    "stokes since periodicity - breaking bifurcations leading to chaos will unavoidably occur .",
    "the results concerning analyticity of structure functions are likely to be the same for burgers turbulence and isotropic 3-d navier  stokes turbulence ( in the limit of vanishing viscosity ) .",
    "indeed , in the latter case all structure functions of order @xmath5 are generally believed to have scaling properties at small separations with nontrivial ( and certainly noninteger ) exponents . as to the third - order structure function",
    ", our proof of analyticity for analytic - in - space forcing can be extended if one assumes that kolmogorov s four - fifths law is valid ( kolmogorov 1941 ; see also chapter 6 of frisch 1995 ) .",
    "burgers turbulence presents an algebraic tail for the pdf of the velocity gradient but nothing similar is known for navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "this may be telling us something about the possible singularities associated to the navier  stokes and euler equations .",
    "a remarkable feature for the burgers equation is that only preshocks but not mature shocks contribute to the power - law tail .",
    "there is indeed a basic difference between the two types of singularities . for analytic forcing , near a mature shock , the solution is not only piecewise analytic ( i.e.  on each side of the shock ) but uniformly so : the radius of convergence of the taylor series remains finite as one approaches a mature shock .",
    "in contrast , when approaching a cubic root preshock singularity , the radius of convergence goes to zero and gradients become very large .",
    "it is the algebraic behavior of their strength which causes the power - law tail .",
    "if the navier  stokes equation , in the limit of vanishing viscosity , were to develop any singularity of this kind ( accompanied by algebraically large gradients ) it should also display a power - law - tail pdf .",
    "further increases in the quality of experimental and numerical turbulence or convection data are needed to find if such singularities are really ruled out .",
