    "theoretical investigations of systems with strong electron correlations in the magnetic field is of interest in connection with the observation of quantum oscillations in the mixed state of underdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "based on the onsager - lifshitz - kosevich theory for metals @xcite the measured decreased quantum oscillation frequencies were interpreted as a manifestation of small fermi surface pockets @xcite . if one anticipate that the normal state in the field coincides with the zero - field state , this interpretation seems to contradict numerous photoemission experiments . to explain the appearance of these small pockets proposals for various states with broken translational symmetry",
    "were suggested @xcite .",
    "other theories relate the decreased quantum oscillation frequency to superconducting fluctuations @xcite or use phenomenology of the marginal fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "crystals , in which the decreased quantum oscillation frequencies were observed , belong to the underdoped region of the cuprate phase diagram , and , therefore , they are characterized by strong electron correlations . the behavior of models of strong correlations in magnetic fields is poorly known . in this work we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-@xmath1 model of cu - o planes .",
    "the used approach allows us to take proper account of strong electron correlations and to consider large enough clusters in moderate magnetic fields .",
    "an approximation is exploited , in which normal - state holes are characterized by large zero - field fermi surfaces for hole concentrations @xmath5 .",
    "we found that in the range @xmath3 the density of hole states at the fermi level oscillates with the inverse magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the oscillations have components with frequencies differing by an order of magnitude .",
    "the high - frequency components are connected with the large fermi surfaces , while the low - frequency components are related to van hove singularities in the landau subbands , which traverse the fermi level with changing @xmath4 .",
    "these van hove singularities are linked with bending the landau subbands due to strong correlations .",
    "frequencies of slow components are of the same order of magnitude as quantum oscillation frequencies observed in underdoped cuprates .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model supplemented with a mechanism , which smears out high - frequency oscillations , is able to interpret low frequencies of quantum oscillations observed in the experiments .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the perpendicular magnetic field reads @xmath6 where 2d vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 label sites of a square plane lattice , @xmath9 is the projection of the hole spin , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are hole creation and annihilation operators with the empty @xmath12 and singly occupied @xmath13 site states .",
    "these three states form the complete set of hole states for the site * l * in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the hole kinetic energy @xmath14 contains the hopping matrix element @xmath15 and the peierls phase factor @xcite with the vector potential @xmath16 .",
    "the exchange term includes the exchange constant @xmath17 and the spin-@xmath18 operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 of localized spins .",
    "the zeeman term is omitted , since for the considered fields and exchange constants in cuprates it is two orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange term .    in the following consideration",
    "we suppose that only nearest neighbor hopping and exchange constants are nonzero , @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 are four vectors connecting nearest neighbor sites . in the landau gauge @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 component of the site vector @xmath7 and @xmath27 is the unit vector along the @xmath28 axis . hence the exponential in the kinetic term of the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath29    we shall restrict our consideration to the fields satisfying the condition @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are integers with no common factor . in this case",
    "the kinetic term of the hamiltonian defines its translation properties ",
    "@xmath14 is invariant with respect to translations by the lattice period along the @xmath28 axis and by @xmath32 lattice periods along the @xmath26 axis . to retain this symmetry we apply the periodic born - von karman boundary conditions to the sample with @xmath34 sites along the @xmath28 axis and @xmath35 sites along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "the boundary conditions define the set of allowed wave vectors with components @xmath36 and @xmath37 with integer @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ pphase ] ) and ( [ condition ] ) , the momenta @xmath40 coincide with some wave vectors in this net .",
    "this allows us to perform the usual fourier transformation , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and obtain for @xmath14 @xmath43    it is convenient to split the brillouin zone into @xmath32 stripes of the width @xmath44 , which are oriented parallel to the @xmath28 axis .",
    "if we select the lowest stripe with @xmath45 , and denote wave vectors in it as @xmath46 , momenta in the entire brillouin zone can be described as @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 . in these notations",
    "the kinetic energy acquires the form @xmath50 , where the summation over @xmath46 is performed over the selected stripe , @xmath51 and the matrix @xmath52 has the following elements : @xmath53 in this equation the matrix indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined modulo @xmath32 .",
    "the hermitian matrix ( [ hmatr ] ) can be diagonalized by the unitary transformation @xmath56 .",
    "since the kinetic energy defines symmetry properties of the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the operators @xmath57 form a basis for a representation of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian .",
    "besides , in the absence of correlations states created by @xmath58 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian . therefore , green s function constructed from these operators , @xmath59 is an appropriate mean for investigating the influence of strong correlations on hole states . in ( [ green ] ) , the averaging over the grand canonical ensemble and the operator time dependence are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath60 with the chemical potential @xmath61 .    to calculate ( [ green ] ) we use the mori projection operator technique @xcite . in this approach ,",

    "the two - pole approximation provides a satisfactory description of the evolution of this band with doping . for @xmath78",
    "the states near the fermi level originate from this band , which gives grounds to use the same approximation for their description .",

    "the @xmath77 fermi surface is large for @xmath79 , having shape of diamonds with rounded corners , which are centered at @xmath80 . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , at moderate doping the pseudogap and fermi arcs reflect the dispersions of the spin - polaron band with the bandwidth @xmath81 and the spectrally less intensive band with the bandwidth @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this latter band has the mentioned large fermi surface .",
