    "the experimental studies of nuclear response in charge  exchange reactions were extended in the eighties to high excitation energies where a first nucleon resonance the @xmath0-isobar can be excited @xcite .",
    "the detailed studies were done for the ( @xmath1he , t ) charge ",
    "exchange reaction at different projectile energies @xcite and different targets @xcite .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0 excited in a nucleus were found different compared to the case of the reaction on a single nucleon .",
    "the difference was both in the peak position and the width of the resonance excited in a complex nucleus .",
    "the review of the observed phenomena can be found in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the appealing explanation of this phenomenon is related to medium effects , namely , the excitation of a pionic nuclear mode @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite although another explanation has been proposed as well @xcite . in this picture",
    "the @xmath0 in nuclear matter does not exist as separate resonance but forms a collective excitation consisting of pionic , @xmath0 and nucleon degrees of freedom .    at first sight",
    "one should not expect sizeable medium effects for ( @xmath1he , t ) reaction since the reaction takes place at the surface of the target @xcite .",
    "for inelastic reactions , however , the absorption is smaller and one should use absorption factor different from that used for elastic scattering @xcite providing both the medium effects and the magnitude of inelastic cross  section .",
    "another important point is the account of the finite target size in the response function . as it will be shown below different @xmath0-hole multipoles",
    "are peaked at different energies so , part of the observed width can be attributed to this displacement .",
    "besides , on finite nucleus the process of coherent pion production is possible .",
    "the process is absent in infinite nuclear matter and it contributes to the shift of the peak position as well .",
    "here we present the results of the absolute cross  section calculations of the @xmath2c(@xmath1he , t ) reaction at 0@xmath3 and at the kinetic energy of the @xmath1he t@xmath4=2 gev .",
    "in the next section we discuss the model for the reaction amplitude that is a driving force for the nuclear response . in the section  [ resp ]",
    "the pionic response function of a finite nucleus is discussed and the cross ",
    "section is calculated in the section  [ cross ] .",
    "we shall start from the discussion of the models for the elementary charge ",
    "exchange reaction p(p , n)@xmath5 . from the early sixties",
    "it was shown this reaction can be described by ope model @xcite , at least at low momentum transfer .",
    "this analysis has been extended for wide range of the proton energies in @xcite , and has been repeated with some minor modifications in connection to the analysis of p(@xmath1he , t ) @xmath5 reaction in @xcite . as it was shown all existing data in the region of low momentum transfer are well described by ope with the soft monopole @xmath6nn- and @xmath6n@xmath0- form factors    @xmath7    the parameter @xmath8 mev at low proton energy and slightly decreases with the proton energy reflecting increase of the absorption effects at high energy . with these soft form factors ( [ form ] ) the main contribution to the @xmath0-production comes from the direct graph shown in fig.1 .",
    "the exchange contribution is small for the p(p , n)@xmath5 reaction .    in this model",
    "the amplitude is completely longitudinal with respect to the momentum transfer . in the other model used for the description of the @xmath0- production at 800 mev proton energy @xcite the transverse part of the amplitude",
    "was described by @xmath9- exchange and hard form factors with @xmath10 = 1.2 gev and @xmath10 = 1.7 gev were used for @xmath6n@xmath0- and @xmath9n@xmath0- vertexes .",
    "the magnitude of the cross  section and the momentum transfer dependence are reproduced in this model due to cancellation between the direct and the exchange parts of the amplitude .",
    "the cancellation is rather delicate and at higher proton energy it can be broken resulting in wrong momentum transfer dependence @xcite .    at very high energy",
    "the situation is different .",
    "the @xmath6-exchange contribution decreases as @xmath11 , where _ s _ is the center  of mass energy squared , while for the @xmath9-exchange the decrease is slower .",
    "its contribution falls down like @xmath12 for small momentum transfer where @xmath13 is the corresponding regge  trajectory .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic region at high energy one should expect the dominance of the @xmath9-exchange even at forward angles .",
    "below 20 gev the cross ",
    "section for forward scattering follows the @xmath14 law @xcite so , the contribution of @xmath9-exchange at intermediate energies is believed to be small .    for the p@xmath15he ,",
    "t)@xmath16 reaction the situation is similar to the ( p , n ) case .",
    "the @xmath6-exchange with the soft form factors ( [ form ] ) gives reasonable description of the absolute cross  section and the tritium spectrum at forward angle for all existing data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at the kinetic energy of @xmath1he 2 gev , which is close in kinematics to 800 mev ( p , n ) one can get good description using @xmath17- exchanges as well @xcite . it would be very desirable to extend the last analysis to higher @xmath1he energies .",
    "it is convenient to start with the plane waves for both projectile and ejectile in order to obtain an expression for the cross  section that can be easily generalized to the distorted waves . in pwia",
    "the cross ",
    "section is proportional to the matrix element , shown in fig.1 , squared and summed over final nuclear and @xmath0 - states .",
    "@xmath18 for plane waves @xmath19 , it gives for the cross ",
    "section @xmath20 the expression under the sum is just imaginary part of the pionic self  energy in nuclear medium . @xmath21 using the pionic self  energy ( [ self ] ) we obtain the final expression for the cross  section suitable for inclusion of medium effects . @xmath22",
    "the main effect of nuclear medium is the renormalization of the pion propagator by intermediate @xmath0-hole loops giving the major contribution to the pionic self  energy ( [ self ] ) near the @xmath0-resonance . to take it into account one must change in ( [ fsec ] ) the bare pion propagator @xmath23 for the dressed one @xmath24 , where @xmath25 making this change we are going out of the scope of the impulse approximation .",
    "the imaginary part of the bare pion propagator is equal to zero for negative @xmath26 .",
    "using it we obtain @xmath27 with these changes the cross  section ( [ fsec ] ) becomes @xmath28 it is clear from ( [ res ] ) the pion propagator @xmath24 in nuclear medium is just the response function to a virtual pion probe .",
    "the excitation created by a virtual pion is no more pure @xmath0-hole but a superposition of the @xmath0-hole and pionic degrees of freedom , which is usually called the pionic mode .    the unquenched @xmath0-hole self  energy ( [ self ] ) produces too much of attraction giving unreasonably low excitation energy for the pionic mode .",
    "in order to make the description more accurate several effects should be taken into account .",
    "first of all , more correct @xmath6n- scattering amplitude reproducing @xmath29 and @xmath30 partial waves should be used since we are interested in the energies lower than the @xmath0 in vacuum . for this purpose",
    "one should add the born diagrams with a nucleon intermediate state , _",
    "u_-channel @xmath0 diagram and a @xmath31-term arising from the @xmath31-commutator @xcite .",
    "second , the short ",
    "range n@xmath0- correlations must be taken into account .",
    "@xmath32 in nuclear matter the effect of short  range correlations can be accounted in the following way .",
    "let us define the @xmath0-hole response function @xmath33 by @xmath34 then , @xmath35 similar effect should be taken into account for the nucleon ",
    "hole response function as well .",
    "but , in the region of interest in excitation energy its contribution is negligible and will be omitted below .",
    "in contrast , the backward @xmath0-hole loops and the @xmath31-term must be retained since they have their own dependence on the virtual pion mass  @xmath26 that influences the position of the pionic branch in nuclear matter .",
    "finally , the virtual pion can be absorbed in nuclear medium emitting two or more nucleons . in the resonance region",
    "the absorption goes via intermediate @xmath0 and it can be described by a @xmath0-nucleus optical potential . at lower energies",
    "the other mechanisms with different intermediate states contribute to the absorption . to take it into account we use the ericson ",
    "ericson optical potential from pionic atoms @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the nuclear matter density . for pionic atoms @xmath38 .",
    "it was obtained from the fit of the mesoatomic level width and contains all absorption mechanisms including the intermediate @xmath0 . using this value in our case",
    "will give double counting since intermediate @xmath0 is considered explicitly .",
    "thus , @xmath39 should be considered as a free parameter accounting another absorption mechanisms .    with these corrections",
    "the pion self  energy in nuclear matter is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the pion decay constant @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 is the @xmath31-commutator for forward pion scattering .",
    "@xmath44 includes both forward and backward @xmath0-hole loops corrected for short  range correlations .",
    "for a finite nucleus it is convenient to work in the configuration space where the self  energy ( [ full ] ) and the pion propagator become the functions of two distinct variables instead of functions of the distance between coordinate points in nuclear matter . @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 the @xmath47 - vertex in the configuration space is @xmath48 where @xmath49 .      for a spherical nucleus the self  energy ( [ full ] )",

    "this is the advantage of using the simple scalar formfactors  ( [ form ] ) .",

    "@xmath63 is the green function of the radial schrdinger equation for the @xmath0 moving in the mean nuclear optical potential .",
    "it was calculated using two independent solutions of the radial schrdinger equation .",
    "the @xmath0-hole contribution to the pion self ",
    "energy was calculated using the following expression @xmath64 where @xmath65 related to @xmath66 via linear integral equation accounting the short  range correlations ( [ corr ] ) @xmath67",

    "the value of @xmath93 used in calculations is @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "two features of the distortion factor ( [ chi ] ) should be mentioned .",
    "first , the @xmath1het form factor can not be separated from the effects of distortion .",
    "second , since the vertex ( [ dvert ] ) has a gradient coupling and the distortion factor ( [ chi ] ) depends on the transversal coordinates , some transversal components arise in the reaction amplitude even if it was before pure longitudinal amplitude .    the multipole expansion of the distorted vertex ( [ dvert ] ) can be obtained directly by multiplying it on @xmath95 , taking trace over spin matrices , and integrating over angles of the unit radius vector @xmath96 .",

    "the indirect integration has been done in the following way .",
    "the function @xmath101 satisfies the integro  differential equation @xmath102 which was solved numerically using the condition for feynman propagator @xmath103 at positive energy . since @xmath104 has an outgoing wave at infinity it fixes the solution of the equation ( [ gout ] ) .",
    "the cross  section expressed in terms of @xmath101 is @xmath105 in the expression ( [ dsecw ] ) the integration over coordinates goes effectively in a finite range , inside the target nucleus .",
    "the nucleon single  particle potential used for the wave functions of the bound nucleons has been taken in the standard woods  saxon form .",
    "@xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the pion compton wavelength , and @xmath110 is the coulomb potential for protons that was taken as the potential of a uniformly charged sphere .",
    "the parameters of the potential are listed in the table 1 .",
    "the response function ( [ fresp ] ) were found not very sensitive to the parameters of the nucleon potential .",
    "the situation is , however , different for the optical @xmath0  nucleus potential that has been taken in similar woods  saxon form .",
    "@xmath111 where @xmath112 are the spin @xmath113 matrices .",
    "2 shows two triton spectra for the @xmath0h contribution demonstrating sensitivity to the real part of the @xmath0nucleus optical potential . in the absence of the @xmath0nucleus interaction the peak position coincides with the one in the reaction on free proton . the attraction produced by the real part of the potential in the final state increases cross - section and shifts the peak position on 15 - 20 mev down .",
    "the parameters of the optical potential are listed in table 2 .",
    "they were taken mainly from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath114 and the diffuseness @xmath115 were kept the same as for the nucleons .",
    "the main feature of the pionic self  energy near the resonance is its large imaginary part .",
    "it is instructive to study separately the effects of real and imaginary parts of the self ",
    "energy on the triton spectra .",
    "fig.3 shows three spectra where either real or imaginary part of the self  energy were accounted in comparison to the quasifree case .",
    "the real part of the self  energy is attractive and it brings more strength to the @xmath0-hole peak . in analogy with particle ",
    "hole excitations one can say the real part of the pionic self  energy makes the @xmath0-hole peak more collective .",
    "the peak position , however , changes not much . the imaginary part , takes all this collectivity back decreasing cross  section due to incoherent @xmath0 decay so , when both parts are taken into account the cross  section appeared close to its quasifree magnitude as it is shown in fig.3 and fig.4 .    in fig.3 one",
    "can see that the imaginary part of the self  energy produces also some shift in the peak position .",
    "the origin of the shift is , however , different from the shift due to the real part . to understand its origin",
    "let us return to nuclear matter and compare two expressions for the cross - sections with and without renormalization of the pion propagator . without renormalization the cross ",
    "section is proportional to @xmath116 while in the other case it is proportional to @xmath117 for simplicity the real part is omitted in this expression .",
    "the first case corresponds to quasifree mechanism and the peak position is at the same place as in the reaction on a proton . in the second case",
    "the cross - section starts to grow at the same threshold but at the resonance where @xmath118 we have the cross ",
    "section proportional to @xmath119 thus , instead of maximum the cross ",
    "section appeared to be small at this energy .",
    "since the cross  section is growing from threshold one can immediately conclude that the maximum of the cross - section will be below the resonance position .",
    "fig.5 demonstrates this effect for the @xmath120 multipole in the case of finite nucleus .",
    "this effect is not so much pronounced for higher multipoles that determine the magnitude of the cross  section .",
    "the higher multipoles undergo smaller medium effects since they are peaked at nuclear surface where the density is small .",
    "therefore , the overall shift of the peak position is smaller than for @xmath120 .",
    "the imaginary part of the optical @xmath0 - nucleus potential makes this effect stronger as it is shown in fig.6 .",
    "the contribution of separate multipoles to the triton spectrum is shown in the fig.7 .",
    "the contribution of the low multipoles @xmath120 and @xmath121 is almost negligible due to strong absorption of the incoming and outgoing ions .",
    "the main contribution comes from the multipoles between @xmath122 to @xmath123 although higher multipoles , at least up to @xmath124 , have to be cosidered at higher excitation energy .",
    "another feature clearly seen in the fig.7 is rather wide spreading of the different multipole contributions .",
    "the @xmath122 contribution is most sensitive to the medium effects shifting down the transition strength . it has the largest downward shift in the peak position .",
    "the absorption of the @xmath1he and t is smaller for @xmath122 compared to @xmath120 resulting in sizeable contribution to the cross  section .",
    "higher multipoles have smaller medium effects and their peak positions are at more and more high excitation energies .",
    "this produce large displacement width of summed triton spectrum .",
    "fig.8 shows the final triton spectrum toghether with separate contributions of the @xmath0hole excitations and the coherent pion production .",
    "the process of coherent pion production gives sizeable contribution to the inclusive triton spectrum .",
    "the maximum of the cross ",
    "section is at about 240 mev excitation energy and it also contributes to the shift of the inclusive peak .",
    "the coherent pion production is absent in infinite nuclear matter , therefore one should expect decrease of the relative yield of coherent pions for heavier nuclei .",
    "for ( @xmath1he , t ) reaction in the @xmath0-region strong deviations from impulse approximations were demonstrated .",
    "the deviations come from the medium effects of renormalization of the pion propagator in the ope mechanism of the elementary charge ",
    "exchange reaction .",
    "the medium effects change both the peak position and its height .",
    "several effects , besides pion renormalization , contribute to the shift of peak position including @xmath0nucleus optical potential , and coherent pion production .",
    "the possible effects of collectivity in the @xmath0hole excitations are strongly suppressed by incoherent @xmath0 decay .",
    "the effects of virtual pion propagation manifest itself only in the process of coherent pion production .    the finite size of a target nucleus produces together with the medium effects large spreading of the observed peak .",
    "the absorption in initial and final states strongly supresses the lowest multipols of the angular momentum transfer .",
    "the glauber approach to the distortion in initial and final states gives reasonable description both the size of the medium effects and the absolute value of the cross  section .    c. ellegaard et al .",
