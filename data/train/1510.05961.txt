    ", these two papers have not taken into account , in their energy efficiency analysis , the network model based on stochastic geometry . therefore , in this paper , we employ stochastic geometry to analyze the energy efficiency of relay - assisted downlink mmwave cellular networks .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "finally , conclusions and suggestions for future work are provided in section vi .",
    "in this section , we introduce our system model for the relay - assisted downlink mmwave cellular network .",

    "similarly , it is designated as a @xmath6 if @xmath8 is closer to this mu than @xmath7 .",
    "also , rss are associated with the closest bs , denoted by @xmath9 .    as shown in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath7-@xmath5 and @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath6 links work in non - overlapping frequency bands with bandwidths @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "a two - slot synchronous communication protocol is assumed in each cell for the @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath6 link . in the first time slot ,",
    "bss transmit signals to rss , while in the second time slot , rss forward the data ( decoded from the received signal in the first time slot ) to the @xmath6s .",
    "the time duration of both time slots are assumed to be equal . since separate frequency bands are assumed ,",
    "the other - cell interference at @xmath5 is due to the bss that use the same resource block with @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the other - cell interference at rss is from the bss operating at the same frequency with @xmath9 , and interference at @xmath6 is due to the rss using the same frequency with @xmath8 .        in this setting",
    ", we have the following three assumptions regarding the system model of the downlink mmwave cellular network :    * assumption 1 : * antenna arrays at the bss , rss and mus are assumed to perform directional beamforming where the main lobe is directed towards the dominant propagation path while smaller sidelobes direct energy in other directions .",
    "for tractability in the analysis , antenna arrays are approximated by a sectored antenna model , in which the array gains are assumed to be constant @xmath12 for all angles in the main lobe and another smaller constant @xmath13 in the side lobe @xcite .",

    "* assumption 2 : * a bs or rs can either have a line - of - sight ( los ) or non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) link to the mu according to the @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 which is the probability that a link of length @xmath24 is los . using field measurements and stochastic blockage models , @xmath23 can be modeled as @xmath25 where decay rate @xmath26 depends on the building parameter and density @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 can be approximated by a step function . in this approach",
    ", the irregular geometry of the los region is replaced with its equivalent los ball model with radius @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a bs or rs is a los node to the mu if it is inside the ball , otherwise it is a nlos node .",
    "different path loss laws are applied to los and nlos links .",
    "thus , the path - loss exponent on each interfering link can be expressed as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the los and nlos path - loss exponents , respectively .    *",
    "assumption 3 : * serving nodes ( bs or rs ) are assumed to be los to the corresponding receiving nodes ( rs or mu ) , and therefore the path loss exponent in the serving link is always equal to @xmath29 .",
    "in this section , we first express the sinrs at the rss and mus by combining the above three assumptions with the described network model .",
    "then , we derive the coverage probabilities for each link .      _",
    "1)@xmath7-@xmath5 link : _ the sinr in the downlink from the the @xmath7 to the @xmath5 can be written as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the transmit power of @xmath7 , @xmath33 is the effective antenna gain of the link which is assumed to be equal to @xmath14 , @xmath34 is the small - scale fading gain , @xmath29 is the los path - loss exponent of the link , @xmath35 is the transmission distance , @xmath36 is the variance of the additive white gaussian noise component , and @xmath37 is the aggregate other - cell interference at @xmath5 . a similar notation is used for @xmath37 , but note that the effective antenna gain @xmath38 and path loss exponent @xmath39 are different for different interfering links as described in ( [ eq : antennagains ] ) and ( [ eq : pathloss ] ) , respectively .    _",
    "2)@xmath9-@xmath8 and @xmath8-@xmath6 links : _ the sinrs in the downlink from the the @xmath9 to the @xmath8 , and from the @xmath8 to the @xmath6 can be written , respectively , as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 where a notation similarly as described in ( [ eq : sinr_bu ] ) is used with similar parameter definitions .",
    "all links are assumed to be subject to independent nakagami fading ( i.e. , small - scale fading gains have a gamma distribution ) .",
    "parameters of nakagami fading are @xmath42 and @xmath43 for los and nlos links , respectively , and they are assumed to be positive integers for simplicity .      the sinr coverage probability @xmath44 is defined as the probability that the received sinr is larger than a certain threshold @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 . the coverage probability in the single - hop transmission and dual - hop relayed transmission can be formulated as follows : @xmath47 since decode - and - forward relaying strategy is employed by the rss , a @xmath6 is served if the sinrs of both links are larger than the threshold @xmath48 . in other words",
    ", @xmath7-@xmath8-@xmath6 link works if both rs and @xmath6 can decode the received signal successfully .",
    "now , the coverage probability for the @xmath7-@xmath5 link can be calculated as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the probability density function of the distance between an mu and its nearest los bs @xcite , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the laplace transform of @xmath37 evaluated at @xmath53 , and ( [ coverageofbulink1 ] ) is derived noting that @xmath54 is a normalized gamma random variable with parameter @xmath42 and using the similar steps in @xcite . since @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath55 is equal to one inside the ball of radius @xmath27 and zero otherwise , integral in ( [ coverageofbulink1 ] ) is from 0 to @xmath27 .",

    "now , we can compute the laplace transform for the los interfering links with a generic antenna gain @xmath19 using stochastic geometry as follows : @xmath68&= e^{-2\\pi\\lambda_{b}p_{g } \\int_{x_0}^{r_b}(1-\\mathbb{e}_h [ e^{-s p_{bu}g h t^{-\\alpha_l } } ] ) p(t)t dt } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\stackrel{(a)}{= } e^{-2\\pi\\lambda_{b}p_{g } \\int_{x_0}^{r_b } ( 1 - 1/(1+sp_{bu}gt^{-\\alpha_l}/n_l)^{n_l})t dt } , \\label{eq : lt_los}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is again the _ los probability function _ , which is equal to 1 inside the ball and ( a ) is obtained by computing the moment generating function ( mgf ) of the gamma random variable @xmath69 .",

    "the only difference is that in the derivation of the laplace transform @xmath75 is used instead of @xmath76 because at any time only at most @xmath75 bss per square meter are transmitting signals to rss .    for the @xmath77 link ,",
    "sinr coverage probability can be computed similarly as for the other links , but the distance between rs and mu follows a different distribution . since the rss are distributed according to a ppp and mus follows some independent stationary point process in the given circular region around the rs , the distance between the mu and its corresponding rs follows a distribution with pdf @xmath78 for @xmath79 @xcite . also , since only the rss with received sinr larger than a certain threshold can decode and forward the signal to the @xmath6s , the density used in sinr coverage calculation for this link is @xmath80 .",
    "finally , coverage probability for the @xmath77 link is given at the top of the next page in ( [ coverageofrulink ] ) where @xmath81 .",
    "the total power consumption per bs or rs can be modeled as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the efficiency of the power amplifier , and @xmath85 is the static power consumption due to signal processing , battery backup , site cooling etc . , and @xmath86 corresponds to the transmit power @xcite . using this power formulation ,",
    "the average power consumption of bss ( per unit area ) in the cellular network can be expressed as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the static power consumption of a bs , @xmath89 is the efficiency of power amplifiers at the bss , and 1/2 factor is due to the fact that rss are active only in one of the two time slots as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : framestructure ] .",
    "the first term is the average static power consumed regardless of whether the bss are active or inactive , and the second term is the average transmit power consumed at bss transmitting to @xmath5s and rss . note that at most only @xmath90 bss per square meter are transmitting signals to rss .",
    "similarly , the average power consumption of the rss ( per unit area ) in the cellular network is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the static power consumption of an rs , @xmath93 is the efficiency of power amplifiers at the rss , and 1/2 factor is due to the fact that rss are active only in the second time slot . in this scenario ,",
    "only the rss which can decode the signals from bss can successfully forward them to @xmath6s , and therefore the density of the active rss is @xmath80 . as a result ,",
    "( @xmath94 ) rss per square meter are inactive and they consume only static power .",
    "thus , the second term is the sum of average transmit power and average static power consumed at active rss .",
    "energy efficiency can be measured and quantified as the ratio of the area spectral efficiency to the average network power consumption : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the area spectral efficiencies taken over all the bs - mu and bs - rs - mu links , respectively .",
    "the area spectral efficiency ( i.e. , network throughput ) can be defined as the product of the throughput at a given link and density of transmitters ( bss or rss ) , and can be formulated as follows @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 factor is due to half - duplex operation of the rss .      in section [ sec : energy efficiency function ] and the preceding analysis , antenna arrays at the serving nodes ( bs or rs ) and receiving nodes ( rs or mu ) are assumed to be aligned",
    "perfectly and energy efficiency is calculated in the absence of beamsteering errors . however , in practice , it may not be easy to have perfect alignment .",
    "therefore , in this section , we investigate the effect of beamforming alignment errors on the energy efficiency of the network .",
    "we employ an error model similar to that in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath100 be the random absolute beamsteering error of the transmitting node toward the receiving node with zero - mean and bounded absolute error @xmath101 .",
    "due to symmetry in the gain @xmath33 , it is appropriate to consider the absolute beamsteering error .",
    "the pdf of the effective antenna gain @xmath33 with alignment error can be explicitly written as @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the kronecker s delta function , @xmath104 is the cdf of the misalignment error and ( [ eq : pdfofg ] ) follows from the definition of cdf , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "assume that the error @xmath106 is gaussian distributed , and therefore the absolute error @xmath100 follows a half normal distribution with @xmath107 , where @xmath108 denotes the error function and @xmath109 is the standard deviation of the gaussian error @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear that all sinr coverage probability expressions in section [ sec : sinr coverage probability ] depend on the effective antenna gain @xmath33 between the serving and the receiving nodes , and so does the energy efficiency .",
    "thus , sinr coverage probability @xmath44 for a generic link can be calculated by averaging over the distribution of @xmath33 , @xmath110 , as follows : @xmath111 where we define @xmath112 .    applying this averaging to coverage probability expressions in all links , and inserting them to the area spectral efficiency and the average network power consumption formulas ,",
    "we can obtain the modified energy efficiency expressions in the presence of beamsteering errors .",

    "it can be seen that for fixed @xmath17 , energy efficiency improves with increasing main lobe gain @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , for fixed @xmath12 decreasing @xmath17 improves energy efficiency because narrower main lobe beam width means that receiving nodes ( rs or mu ) are less likely to be interfered by the main lobe of other transmitting nodes ( bs or rs ) .",
    "also note that optimal bs density , denoted by @xmath113 , with which the energy efficiency is maximized , decreases slightly with increasing beam width and decreasing gain due to growing impact of interference .     for different antenna patterns ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath17 ) .",

    "we notice that optimal bs density @xmath113 decreases with increasing ball radius , because the number of interfering los bss increases with increasing ball radius , and we have assumed that serving nodes are always los to the receiving nodes . as a result , the maximum energy efficiency is achieved with smaller bs density for higher ball radiuses .",
    "also , energy efficiency improves with increasing los path loss exponent for fixed @xmath27 , while @xmath113 remains almost same for the same @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the performance of mmwave networks , while the bottom subfigure depicts the performance of the @xmath0wave one .",
    "we immediately notice that mmwave networks have much higher energy efficiency than in @xmath0wave networks ( noting the scale differences in the y - axes of the two figures ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the use of omni - directional antennas and assuming all interfering nodes whose distances are less than @xmath117 m are interfering with the los path loss @xmath121 in the @xmath0wave cellular network setup , causing severe interference .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we plot the energy efficiency ( ee ) , area spectral efficiency ( ase ) and average network power consumption ( anpc ) as a function of the bs density @xmath76 for different values of rs density @xmath4 , and investigate the effect of rs density on energy efficiency .",
    "as shown in the middle sub - figure , area spectral efficiency of the network increases only very slightly ( which is difficult to notice in the figure but can be seen with higher resolution ) with the increasing rs density because of the increase in sinr coverage probabilities . at the same time , however , having higher number of rss means more power consumption .",
    "consequently , average power consumption of the network also increases as shown in the bottom sub - figure .",
    "since increase in area spectral efficiency can not compensate for the increase in average network power consumption , energy efficiency degrades with increasing rs density as shown in the top sub - figure .",

    "also , due to this increase in the relative impact of interference , less number of bss is preferred with increasing alignment error to achieve the maximum energy efficiency .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the energy efficiency of relay - assisted downlink mmwave cellular networks by incorporating the distinguishing features of mmwave communication into the energy efficiency analysis .",
    "directional beamforming with sectored antenna model and simplified ball - los models have been considered in the analysis .",
    "bss and rss are assumed to be distributed according to independent ppps , and sinr coverage probabilities are derived using tools from stochastic geometry to characterize the energy efficiency .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that employing directional antennas makes the mmwave cellular networks more energy efficient than @xmath0wave cellular networks . in other words , increasing the main lobe gain and decreasing the main lobe beam width results in improved energy efficiency .",
    "we have also shown that bs density should be lowered to achieve the maximum energy efficiency when the los ball radius is larger . moreover , we have observed that there is a tradeoff between the area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency depending on the rs density .",
