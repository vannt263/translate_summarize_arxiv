    "this is due to the thermal broadening of the electronic distribution around the fermi level in the leads . in experimental results,@xcite",
    "however , the heights of the third , fifth , 10th and 17th peaks increase with temperature , in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "we propose possible mechanisms for this anomalous @xmath85 dependence of the peak heights , considering small anisotropy and anharmonicity of the quantum dot , @xmath86 they cause `` fine structures '' in the shells of energy levels .",
    "the peak positions , discussed above , are little affected by these fine structures when @xmath87 and @xmath88 are sufficiently small.@xcite    to explain the @xmath85 dependence of the third and fifth peaks , we make two assumptions .",
    "( i ) a small anisotropy of the dot ( @xmath89 ) splits two degenerate levels in the second shell by @xmath90 ( @xmath91 k ) .",
    "( ii ) the transmission amplitude , @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) , for the lower level in the second shell is one - quarter of that for the upper level . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) , we present the first to sixth peaks of the linear conductance through a quantum dot as a function of gate voltage .",
    "the third and fifth peaks are smaller in height at @xmath93 ( @xmath94 0.3 k , dotted lines ) than at @xmath95 ( @xmath94 1 k , solid lines ) .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "when @xmath96 , the third electron is almost always transported through the lower level in the second shell , which has a smaller transmission probability to the leads than the upper level . with increasing temperature , the upper level contributes more to the third peak , and consequently the third peak becomes larger .",
    "the situation is the same for the fifth peak.@xcite    when wavefunctions @xmath26 are written by a single slater determinant , we can derive the analytical expression for the conductance .",
    "when a current flows through a single level in the dot ( @xmath73 ) , the conductance is given by @xmath97 with @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100.@xcite in the case of the third peak , two levels @xmath101 take part in the current .",
    "the conductance is expressed by @xmath102 here , the spin degeneracy of each level has been counted.@xcite the @xmath85 dependence of the conductance is characterized by two parameters , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a possible mechanism for the @xmath85 dependence of the 10th peak ( also the 17th peak ) is the `` spin blockade.''@xcite figure [ fig : fig4](b ) shows the 7th to 12th peaks of the linear conductance .",
    "a small anharmonicity is assumed ( @xmath105).@xcite the 10th peak shows the anomalous @xmath85 dependence for the following reason .",
    "the ground state for @xmath106 has the total spin of @xmath107 whereas the ground state for @xmath108 has @xmath65 .",
    "the 10th peak is very small at low temperatures ( dotted line ) since the addition of the 10th electron on the dot is forbidden by the spin selection rule . with an increase in temperature , electrons are transported more smoothly through transition - allowed excited states , and as a result , the height of the peak grows ( solid line ) .",
    "in the coulomb blockade region , the current is suppressed exponentially with decreasing temperature , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) . in this region , however , the higher - order tunneling processes make a significant contribution to the transport of electrons .",
    "these processes involve the simultaneous tunneling of more than one electron and is thus called cotunneling.@xcite there are two kinds of cotunneling processes , elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "the latter process is accompanied by a change of the dot state whereas the former process is not .    to illustrate the cotunneling processes ,",
    "let us consider a simplified situation : one electron occupies one of two energy levels , @xmath109 or @xmath110 , in a quantum dot ( fig .",

    "( [ eq : t11 ] ) and ( [ eq : t12 ] ) stem from two virtual states in which the dot is doubly occupied or unoccupied .",
