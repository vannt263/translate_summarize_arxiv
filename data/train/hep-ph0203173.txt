    "<S> we investigate the newly observed muon @xmath0 anomaly in the framework of a sequential fourth generation model with a heavy fourth neutrino , @xmath1 . we find that @xmath0 can exclude most values of @xmath2 and put a very stringent constraint on the existence of the fourth generation . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain bounds of a @xmath3 leptonic mixing matrix elements , @xmath4 if it really exists .    </S>",
    "<S> = -30 mm    at present , standard model ( sm ) has to face the experimental difficulties which are all relate to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to indicate the presence of new physics just round the corner will be in the leptonic part . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , there are convincing evidences that neutrinos are massive and oscillate in flavor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the experiment e821 @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory disagrees with the sm expectations at more than 2.6@xmath5 level .    defined as @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> the recent measurement of @xmath7 is @xmath8 where the sm prediction is @xmath9 thus , one finds @xmath10 which gives the old @xmath11 deviation . </S>",
    "<S> but the revised difference between experiment and sm is @xmath12 which is now only a @xmath13 deviation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the deviation drops from @xmath11 to @xmath13 , it might seem that the absolute magnitude of the deviation may be a hint of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> there have been a lot of scenarios of new physics proposed to interpret the non - vanishing and positive value of @xmath14 . in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the sequential fourth generation standard model ( sm4 ) to investigate its contributions to @xmath7 .    from the point of phenomenology </S>",
    "<S> , there is a realistic question what are numbers of the fermions generation or weather there are other additional quarks or leptons . the present experiments </S>",
    "<S> tell us there are only three generation fermions with @xmath15 neutrinos which mass are less smaller than @xmath16@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the experiments do nt exclude the existence of other additional generation , such as the fourth generation , with a @xmath17 neutrino , i.e. @xmath18@xcite . many refs . </S>",
    "<S> have studied the sm4 @xcite , which is added an up - like quark @xmath19 , a down - like quark @xmath20 , a lepton @xmath21 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath22 in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of these new fermions are all the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm mixing , see tab.1 ,    .the elementary particle spectrum of sm4 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if there exists a very heavy fourth neutrino @xmath1 , it can contribute to @xmath7 through diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . this is a electroweak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> similar to that of quarks , the corresponding lagragian is @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the ( 2,4 ) element of the four - generation ckm matrix ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath26    reverting back to the diagrams of fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the fourth neutrino contribution to @xmath7 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fine construction constant and @xmath30    we suppose that the 1.6@xmath5 discrepancy of muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath31 , is induced by the fourth sequential neutrino @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . we can use the above equation to get parameter space of @xmath32 and @xmath25 to @xmath2 ( see fig . 2 and 3 ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we can see that @xmath32 is taken negative values except for a very narrow range of @xmath2 which is from 58@xmath34 to 80@xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the sign of @xmath35 is only related to @xmath36 mass . only in this narrow mass range , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 gives positive contribution to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the low bound of @xmath37 we get from @xmath0 is consistent with the present experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the upper bound , @xmath38 , seems to conflict with the current experiments statue which there is no any new physics signals upper to several gevs . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth generation particles seems not to be so light . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , if we consider the unitarity of the matrix @xmath39 and tiny values of its elements , the reasonable value range of @xmath40 will be more narrow .    in summary , we calculate the contribution of the fourth generation to @xmath41 and get an interesting result which we can exclude most values of @xmath2 . considering the new revised deviation of @xmath41 , we give the parameter space of @xmath37 and lepton mixing matrix element @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath41 can constrain on the neutrino mass of the fourth generation : i.e. its mass should be heavier than 58 gev and lighter than 80 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that from the lepton part , the current experiments can impose a stringent constraint on the existence of the fourth generation . </S>"
