    "giant resonances represent a prime example of collective modes in the nucleus .",
    "a smooth mass - number dependence of the resonance parameters is characteristic of all nuclear giant resonances and , as such , a study of them yields information about the non - equilibrium dynamics and the bulk properties of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the oldest and best known giant resonance is the ivgdr owing to the high selectivity for isovector e1 excitation in photo - absorption experiments .",
    "the properties of the ivgdr have been studied extensively using ( @xmath9,xn)-type experiments , particularly in the saclay @xcite and livermore @xcite laboratories .",
    "these sets of experiments are a major source of information with respect to the @xmath9-strength function @xcite above the neutron threshold - an important quantity used in statistical reaction calculations relevant to applications like astrophysical large - scale reaction networks @xcite , reactor design @xcite , or nuclear waste transmutation @xcite .",
    "recently , a new experimental technique for the extraction of electric dipole - strength distributions in nuclei via relativistic coulomb excitation has been developed  @xcite .",
    "it utilises proton inelastic scattering with energies of a few hundred mev at scattering angles close to @xmath10 .",
    "although many experiments focus on establishing the strength below the neutron threshold and its contribution to the dipole polarizability @xcite , such data also provide information on the photo - absorption cross sections in the energy region of the ivgdr .",
    "the chain of stable even - even neodymium isotopes is known to comprise a sudden transition from spherical to deformed ground states for heavier isotopes and thus represents an excellent test case to study the influence of deformation on the properties of the ivgdr .",
    "a ( @xmath9,xn ) experiment at saclay @xcite revealed that the width increases with deformation evolving into a pronounced double - hump structure in the most deformed nuclide @xmath4nd , considered to be a textbook example @xcite of @xmath5-splitting owing to oscillations along the different axes of the quadrupole - deformed ground state . here",
    ", we report new photo - absorption cross sections for @xmath2nd extracted from 200 mev proton scattering experiments with results differing significantly from ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , no double - hump structure is observed in the most deformed @xmath4nd nucleus .",
    "this finding is confirmed in a further measurement of the comparably deformed @xmath3sm nucleus , again in contrast to ( @xmath9,xn ) results @xcite .",
    "this unexpected result may be related to the special structure of these two nuclei which are predicted to lie near the critical point of a shape phase transition from spherical to quadrupole - deformed ground states .",
    "the proton inelastic scattering experiments were performed at the ithemba laboratory for accelerator based sciences ( ithemba labs ) in south africa . the k600 magnetic spectrometer , positioned at 0@xmath1 with the acceptance defined by a circular collimator having an opening angle ,",

    "[ fig : ddcsall-20kev ] it is immediately clear that the width of the ivgdr increases steadily from the nearly spherical @xmath24nd nucleus through the transition region to the more deformed @xmath4nd and @xmath3sm nuclei .    in order to compare to the ( @xmath9,xn ) data of carlos et al .",

    "[ fig:150ndconversion](a ) ( pink line ) was determined through the use of position and width information from a study of the isgqr in the nd isotope chain @xcite with methods analogous to refs .",
    "the strength of the isgqr contribution was estimated from the ratio of gqr strength to gdr strength as provided from distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) calculations assuming 100% exhaustion of the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "a phenomenological background ( blue line ) describes the behaviour of the double - differential cross section at the high excitation energy part of the spectrum where the coulomb excitation contribution to the cross section is negligible .",
    "this component incorporates all unknown multipolarity contributions as well as quasi - free scattering and is approximated by finding the maximum of the cross section between @xmath26 mev and 23 mev and using a width that best describes the spectrum in this region .",

    "the present setup at @xmath8 does not allow for the determination of accurate vertical scattering angles , thus limiting the angular resolution @xcite .",
    "we therefore refrain from extracting absolute photo - absorption cross sections .",
    "the excitation energy dependence of the conversion , however , is not affected .",
    "through the simultaneous measurement of the partial photo - nuclear cross sections @xmath29 and @xmath30 using a monochromatic photon beam total photo - absorption cross sections can be determined in heavy nuclei .",

    "@xcite ( green histograms ) observed a spreading of the ivgdr as the nuclei become softer followed by a splitting of the ivgdr into two distinct dipole modes for @xmath4nd and @xmath3sm , which were interpreted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 components .",

    "the best fit to the experimental data was selected such that the value for the reduced @xmath38 was optimised . in the case of the @xmath12nd isotope ,",

    "although they are already well deformed , their deformation potential is soft in the @xmath40 degree of freedom @xcite .",

    "[ fig : cvslmd - norm ] and table  [ table : gammaparam ] , the most obvious discrepancies are found in the lower excitation - energy ( @xmath32 ) region . when normalised to facilitate a shape comparison between the two data sets , the contributions to the equivalent photo - absorption cross sections in the @xmath32 region are substantially lower than those reported by carlos et al .",
    "recent ( @xmath9,n ) experiments  @xcite also find systematically smaller photo - absorption cross sections in the excitation - energy region between the neutron threshold and @xmath41 mev corroborating the present results .",
    "furthermore , a recent study of the e1 strength in @xmath42sm @xcite with the methods decribed in refs .  @xcite does find a double - hump structure but with a clearly reduced @xmath43 ratio compared to the saclay data @xcite .",
    "these findings are qualitatively consistent with a reanalysis of the saclay method @xcite , which indicates that their ( @xmath9,n ) cross sections are too large and ( @xmath9,2n ) cross sections too small .",
    "in order to investigate the role of @xmath32 and @xmath33 components further , a comparison with rpa calculations particularly suited for modelling the ivgdr is presented .",
    "the calculations are performed within the skyrme separable random phase approximation ( ssrpa ) approach @xcite .",
    "the method is fully self - consistent since both the mean field and residual interaction are derived from the same skyrme functional .",
    "the residual interaction includes all the functional contributions as well as the coulomb direct and exchange terms .",
    "the self - consistent factorisation of the residual interaction crucially reduces the computational effort for deformed nuclei and maintains high accuracy of the calculations @xcite .",

    "the code exploits the 2d grid in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "usually , the axial quadrupole deformation characterised by the parameter @xmath14 is determined by minimisation of the total energy , and @xmath14 values obtained are typically close to experiment @xcite .",
    "nd and sm isotopes in the transitional region , however , show very soft deformation energy surfaces , which gives a large uncertainty to the theoretical ground - state deformations .",
    "we thus adopt the experimental values @xmath44 , 0.20 , 0.29 and 0.31 @xcite for the quadrupole deformation in @xmath45nd and @xmath3sm , respectively .",

    "pairing is treated with delta forces at the bcs level @xcite .",
    "a large two - quasiparticle basis up to @xmath46100 mev is taken into account . the energy - weighted sum rule for isovector e1 strength",
    "is exhausted by @xmath47% .",
    "the ssrpa strength function @xmath48 ( sum over all ssrpa states ) uses a lorentz folding @xmath49 with an averaging parameter @xmath50 kev .        to facilitate a broad structure comparison between the experimental results and the model calculations ,",
    "the ssrpa predictions were smoothed with a large width @xmath51 mev .",

    "[ fig : broadssrpa ] as green ( @xmath52 ) , blue ( @xmath53 ) and red ( total ) lines . when the experimental data are normalised to exhaust the theoretically predicted energy - weighted sum rules ,",
    "good agreement is obtained . for @xmath4nd and @xmath3sm ,",
    "the @xmath52 component overshoots the data ( but lies below the saclay results ) .",
    "it is clear from the above arguments that the assumption of a ground state with a well - defined prolate quadrupole deformation underlying the calculations is questionable for these nuclei .",
    "a measurement of the ( p , p@xmath6 ) reaction at @xmath7 mev and @xmath54 favouring relativistic coulomb excitation in the energy region of the ivgdr has been presented for the even - even @xmath55nd isotopic chain as well as for @xmath3sm .",
    "while the high energy - resolution data show considerable fine structure ( even in the deformed isotopes ) , which carries information on the role of different decay mechanisms of the giant resonances @xcite and level densities @xcite , the present work focuses on a study of the evolution of the ivgdr as a function of deformation .",
    "a general broadening of the ivgdr is observed with increasing deformation and the most deformed @xmath4nd and @xmath3sm nuclei exhibit a prononounced asymmetry , but no double - hump structure owing to @xmath5-splitting evolves in contrast to previous photo - absorption data from saclay @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of the peculiar nature of these two nuclei which lie close to the critical point of a shape phase transition from vibrators to rotators characterised by a soft potential in @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "self - consistent rpa model calculations with the skyrme sly6 force particularly suited to describe the ivgdr provide a fair description of the data consistent with the reduction of cross sections on the low - energy side of the resonance with respect to the saclay data observed in recent experiments @xcite and suggested by a reanalysis @xcite . in view of their general relevance , the present results call for a systematic reinvestigation of photo - absorption data in heavy deformed nuclei .",
