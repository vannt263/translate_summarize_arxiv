    "this paper concerns leibniz  mach  barbour - type @xcite relationalism , which involves the following postulates and implementations .",
    "\\i ) _ temporal relationalism _ is that there is no overall notion of time for the universe as a whole .",
    "this is mathematically implemented at the classical level by considering reparametrization - invariant actions that are free of extraneous time variables [ e.g. newtonian time or general relativity ( gr ) s lapse ] .",
    "such actions are often jacobi - type actions @xcite , whose integrand is the square root of the product of kinetic and potential factors .",
    "reparametrization invariance then guarantees that primary constraints exist @xcite , which for jacobi - type actions have quadratic but not linear dependence in the momenta .",
    "\\ii ) _ configurational relationalism _ is that there is a certain group @xmath4 of transformations that are physically irrelevant , between the physically indiscernible states @xcite .",
    "this can be implemented by considering one s action to be built out of arbitrary @xmath4-frame objects . in the principal examples of this paper , the auxiliary variables associated with @xmath4",
    "then only show up explicitly in the action as corrections to its velocities , and variation with respect to these auxiliaries produces linear secondary constraints that subsequently ensure the physical irrelevance of @xmath4 .",
    "relational particle mechanics ( rpm s ) are examples of relational theories in this sense . in _",
    "euclidean rpm ( erpm ) _",
    "@xcite ( and further studied in @xcite ) @xmath4 is the euclidean group of translations and rotations , so that this is a mechanics in which only relative times , relative angles and relative separations are meaningful . on the other hand , in _ similarity rpm ( srpm ) _",
    "( proposed in @xcite and on distinct foundations in @xcite and further studied in @xcite ) , @xmath4 is the similarity group of translations , rotations and dilations , so that this is a mechanics in which only relative times , relative angles and ratios of relative separations are meaningful .",
    "the more recently proposed srpm turns out to be easier to study . for ,",
    "what turned out to be @xcite a configuration space study for srpm was found to be already present elsewhere in the literature @xcite . furthermore in 1- and 2-@xmath0 ( i term these models with n particles _ n - stop metroland _ and _ n - a - gonland _ respectively , referring to the 3 and 4 particle cases of the latter as _ triangleland _ and _ quadrilateralland _ ) , the srpm configuration spaces are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this gives a second direct way of implementing configurational relationalism as the natural mechanics in the sense of jacobi and of synge ( see e.g. @xcite ) on these geometries . and , via numerous geometrical and methods of mathematical physics techniques being available",
    ", it also permits solution of concrete examples @xcite .",
    "however , the below motivation makes it clear that it is erpm that we want for many purposes ; the present paper concerns setting up the study of this .",
    "the abovementioned srpm study continues to be of value here due to its also occuring as a subproblem within erpm .",
    "my minor motivation for studying rpm s concerns the absolute versus relative motion debate that goes back to newton and leibniz @xcite ( while this is very important topic , we only have a few contributions to make to it in this paper ) .",
    "my major motivation , however , is as follows .",
    "gr is also relational in the above sense , since it can be cast in terms of a jacobi - type action with the spatial 3-diffeomorphisms playing the role of @xmath4 @xcite  this is a variant of its canonical geometrodynamics formulation @xcite .",
    "this furbishes the large number of analogies in secs 4 and 7 , by which rpm s are a useful toy model of ( the canonical geometrodynamics formulation of ) gr in many ways .",
    "for example rpm s have recently been studied as regards building fairly solvable models of quantization approaches @xcite .",
    "rpm s relational features are useful for whole - universe modelling , which is the setting for quantum cosmology and the problem of time in quantum gravity . for both of these motivations , then , working with erpm rather than srpm is preferable due to scale usually being taken to be physically significant in nature .    the notorious _ problem of time _ @xcite occurs because ` time ' takes a different meaning in each of gr and ordinary quantum theory .",
    "this incompatibility underscores a number of problems with trying to replace these two branches with a single framework in situations in which the premises of both apply , namely in black holes and in the very early universe .",
    "one facet of the problem of time appears in attempting canonical quantization of gr in its dynamical guise of ` geometrodynamics ' ( evolving spatial geometries ) .",
    "this gives a gr momentum constraint @xmath7 that is linear in the momenta as well as a hamiltonian constraint @xmath8 that is quadratic but not linear in the momenta .",
    "then elevating @xmath8 to a quantum equation produces a stationary i.e timeless or frozen wave equation  the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath9 ( for @xmath10 the wavefunction of the universe )  in place of ordinary qm s time - dependent one .",
    "see sec 5 ( or @xcite in more detail ) for other facets of the problem of time .",
    "there are various distinct and conceptually - interesting strategies proposed toward understanding the problem of time .",
    "a ) perhaps one is to seek a _ hidden time _ within classical gr by canonical transformation @xcite .",
    "b ) or perhaps gr in general has no time fundamentally , but a time nevertheless _ emerges _ under certain circumstances , e.g. in the _ semiclassical approach _",
    "s regime , in which slow , heavy ` h ' variables provide an approximate timestandard with respect to which the other fast , light ` l ' degrees of freedom evolve @xcite . in gr quantum cosmology , ` h ' is scale ( and homogeneous matter modes ) and ` l ' are inhomogeneities .",
    "c ) or perhaps one should take the universe as a whole to be timeless @xcite and see what can be done , e.g. considering only questions about the universe ` being ' , rather than ` becoming ' , a certain way . e.g. _ records theory _",
    "@xcite concerns whether localized subconfigurations of a single instant contain useable information / correlations , and whether a semblance of dynamics or history thereby arises .",
    "d ) or , perhaps instead it is the histories that are primary : _ histories theory _ @xcite . none of the above strategies has been carried out detail for full gr ; they are usually probed with toy models .",
    "minisuperspace @xcite ( homogeneous gr ) has often been used thus @xcite .",
    "this paper s rpm analogies include various that are rendered trivial in minisuperspace .",
    "an important feature of gr ( and one missed out by minisuperspace models ) is @xmath7 , and this causes substantial complications e.g. in attempted resolutions of the problem of time @xcite .",
    "however , rpm s zero total angular momentum constraint @xmath11 ( arising from variation with respect to the rotational auxiliary ) is a nontrivial analogue of @xmath7 in a number of ways .",
    "another feature of gr that has an analogue for rpm s but not for minisuperspace is the possession of a notion of localization and thus of structure formation .",
    "minisuperspace is , however , closer to gr i ) in having more specific and gr - inherited potentials to rpm s much greater freedom in these : in srpm the potential must be homogeneous of degree 0 ( i.e. a function of pure shape alone ) , while in erpm the potential is completely free .",
    "ii ) in having indefinite kinetic terms to rpm s mechanical and hence positive - definite ones . thus minisuperspace and rpm s are to some extent complementary in their similarities to gr , and thus in their usefulnesses as toy models thereof .",
    "midisuperspace has all of these features but at the price of considerable technical complexity , which obstructs a number of problem of time calculations .",
    "the other foundational quantum cosmology issues that rpm s do or are likely to contribute to ( at least qualitatively ) are as follows .",
    "does structure formation in the universe have a quantum mechanical origin @xcite ? in gr , this requires midisuperspace or at least inhomogeneous perturbations about minisuperspace , and these are hard to study .",
    "there are also a number of difficulties associated with closed system physics @xcite and observables , speculations on initial conditions , the meaning and form of the wavefunction of the universe ( e.g. whether a uniform state is to play an important role @xcite ) and attempting to explain the arrow of time @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for quantum cosmological use of rpm s and @xcite for uses of rpm s in the study of the problem of time .",
    "so far in the rpm toy model program , and mostly still so in the present paper , it is plain rather than oriented shapes that are considered ( i.e. a shape and its mirror image are considered distinct ) .",
    "the main new feature of the present paper is inclusion of scale in the shape - scale split form of the ( already ) reduced formulation , so as to be able to start making contact with the aforementioned quantum cosmological issues , and semiclassical and dilational hidden time approaches to the problem of time .",
    "scalefree 4-stop metroland @xcite and scalefree triangleland @xcite have already been studied . in the context with scale ,",
    "3-stop metroland also becomes meaningful ( it now possesses two degrees of freedom so that it can be solved for one of these in terms of the other , time itself being meaningless in relational whole - universe models ) ; the present paper studies this , scaled 4-stop metroland and scaled triangleland .",
    "each of 4-stop metroland and triangleland differ in some useful features as regards problem of time and quantum cosmology applications .",
    "the advantage of triangleland is that it permits modelling of situations with both scale and a nontrivial constraint .",
    "the advantages of 4-stop metroland are an easier realization of the sphere , and that it can be split into subsystems , each of which is nontrivial ( useful for records theory ) .",
    "quadrilateralland combines all of these advantages but is harder and beyond the scope of this paper ( see @xcite for a start ) ; it also makes good sense to study these advantages and their application to problem of time strategies separately in such regimes with more tractable ( spherical ) mathematics prior to attempting to combine them in an arena with rather less tractable ( @xmath12 ) mathematics .",
    "a long term goal of the rpm program is to use quadrilateralland to investigate how to combine records theory with scale - driven semiclassical approach to the problem of time and to quantum cosmology ( perhaps simultaneously with histories theory ) .",
    "the interest in such a combination ( see e.g. @xcite ) is due to there being a records theory within histories theory , histories decohereing ( ` self - measuring ' ) being one possible way of obtaining a semiclassical regime in the first place , and the elusive question of what decoheres what should be answerable through where information is actually stored , i.e. what and where the records thereby formed are .    in scalefree rpm s , understanding the configuration spaces ( _ shape spaces _ ) @xcite was key to ( and provided an alternative foundation for ) the study @xcite of their classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "thus i likewise begin the present paper on scaled rpm ( sec 2 ) by considering its configuration spaces ( _ relational spaces _ ) . in shape  scale split form , these are the _ cones _ over the corresponding shape spaces .",
    "appropriate mathematical treatment of shape space already existed in the literature in a different context ( work by kendall @xcite toward the statistical theory of shape ) ; the present paper gathers the scaled relational space counterpart with a number of ties to the celestial mechanics and molecular physics literatures . following @xcite ,",
    "i furthermore consider how the shape spaces and relational spaces ( which i jointy term _ relationalspaces _ ) can be tessellated by their physical interpretation .",
    "this is useful for subsequent reading off the physical significance of classical trajectories and qm wavefuctions @xcite .",
    "i also explain how to consider scaled 3- and 4-stop metroland and triangleland in terms of periodic quantities @xmath13 whose squares sum to 1 and a scale variable running from 0 to @xmath14 . while the last two are both @xmath15 and involve three @xmath13 s , they differ significantly in the form and geometrical meaning that their @xmath13 and scale variables take",
    ". in scaled 4-stop metroland",
    "the radial coordinate is the square root of the moment of inertia @xmath16 , the intuitive radius in mass - weighted configuration space , while for scaled triangleland this role is played by the moment of inertia @xmath17 itself .",
    "also , in scaled 4-stop metroland the @xmath13 are the cartesian components of the unit vector , while in scaled triangleland they are normalized dragt - type coordinates @xcite .",
    "the above quantities furthermore are good variables @xcite as regards kinematical quantization @xcite , as well as identifiable as geometrically significant shape quantities .    in sec 3 ,",
    "i consider rpm s in    \\a ) the indirect implementation of configurational relationalism in which the theories were originally conceived .",
    "\\b ) in the _ relationalspace approach _ , i.e. following as the natural mechanics ( in the sense of jacobi and of synge ) constructed on the relationalspace geometry ; this is a direct implementation of configurational relationalism which is available in 1- and 2-@xmath0 .",
    "this approaches the identity of indescernibles directly : indiscernible configurations are never considered multiply .",
    "\\c ) the _ reduction scheme _ involves eliminating a ) s auxiliary variables , and this is found to coincide with b ) , at least at the classical level .",
    "this approaches the identity of indiscernibles via their mathematical identification .",
    "\\d ) i also consider rearranging newtonian mechanics by passing to absolute  relative split generalized coordinates , and compare the somewhat - related b ) , c ) .",
    "finally , i also include some discussion of the physical interpretation of conserved quantities in rpm s . in sec 4 ,",
    "i present 52 analogies between rpm s and gr ( many of which are new to this paper ) .    in sec 5 ,",
    "i account for differences in the form of laplacian between the one i use for rpm s @xcite [ which is quite in line with quantum cosmology @xcite ) and the one which is used in the molecular physics literature ( which follows from scheme d ) ] .",
    "this point is relevant both to the operator ordering problem in quantum gravity and quantum cosmology and as an ` absolute imprint ' contribution at the quantum level to the long - standing absolute versus relative motion debate . in sec",
    "6 , i consider the further issue of whether rpm s configuration spaces have monopole issues , which is a significant preliminary consideration prior to being able to provide a detailed quantum study of scaled rpm s ; this done , i can now present such quantum studies elsewhere @xcite .",
    "corresponding gauge potentials ( of guichardet @xcite and various analogues thereto ) are provided in the appendix .    in sec 7 ,",
    "i fix the aforementioned freedom in potential of rpm s via the mechanics  cosmology analogy , such that rpm s scale dynamics closely parallels that of known simple early universe cosmological models .",
    "this analogy is quite well - known in the case of late - universe dust models @xcite , but i consider it in a wider sense that does not require similarness to the observed later universe but rather just mathematical parallels with simple plausible early universe cosmology models .",
    "this is a significant improvement in selection of potentials for rpm models , earlier ones having been chosen , on grounds of simplicity and/or good behaviour to be constant or multiple harmonic oscillator - like @xcite .",
    "the value of rpm toy models with such parallels is that their accompanying dynamics of small shape changes is , firstly , more tractable than gr quantum cosmology s accompanying dynamics of small inhomogeneities ( e.g. halliwell and hawking s work @xcite ) , while also , secondly , unlike the consideration of small anisotropies in minisuperspace , being a bona fide local structure formation , which is relevant in e.g. semiclassical and records theoretic approaches to the problem of time .",
    "i support this in sec 8 by considering simple classical solutions of the ( approximately ) separated - out scale part : which mechanics models cosmologically - standard models map to ( and vice versa , to a certain extent ) .",
    "i apply this in sec 9 to obtain approximate timestandards for the semiclassical approach to the problem of time .",
    "finally , the present paper s advances and clarifications make qm study possible for scaled 3- and 4-stop metrolands @xcite ( @xcite has an outline for the former ) , and for scaled triangleland @xcite ; these papers will contain e.g. internal time , semiclassical approach , histories and records theory applications @xcite .",
    "a configuration space for n particles in dimension @xmath0 is @xmath18d@xmath19 .",
    "i denote particle position coordinates by    \\{@xmath20 , @xmath17 = 1 to n } and particle masses by @xmath21 .",
    "rendering absolute position irrelevant ( e.g. by passing to any sort of relative coordinates ) leaves one on a configuration space _ relative space _ = @xmath22d@xmath23 ( for n = n  1 ) .",
    "the most obvious relative space coordinates formed from these are some basis set among the @xmath24 , however certain linear combinations of these  _ relative jacobi coordinates _ @xcite  prove to be more advantageous to use .",
    "i denote these by @xmath25 , @xmath26 to n}. these are physically relative separations between _ clusters _ of particles ( see fig 1 for the particular examples of these used in this paper ) , and their main advantage is that in them the kinetic metric is cast in diagonal form , and indeed looks just like for the @xmath27 s but involving one object less and with cluster masses @xmath28 in place of particle masses @xmath21 ( c.f .",
    "sec 3.2 ) .",
    "in fact , i use _ mass - weighted _ relative jacobi coordinates @xmath29 , their squares the partial moments of inertia @xmath30 and ` _ normalized _ ' versions of both of these , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively ( dividing by @xmath33 and @xmath17 respectively , where @xmath17 is the total moment of inertia of the system ) .",
    "moreover , for triangleland or 3-stop metroland , there are 3 permutations of the above , corresponding to following each of the particle clusterings \\{1 , 23 } , \\{2 , 31 } and \\{3 , 12 } respectively ( fig 1b ) .",
    "i use ( a ) as shorthand for \\{a , bc } where a , b , c form a cycle .",
    "on the other hand , quadrilateralland and 4-stop metroland both have both h - shaped and k - shaped jacobi coordinates ( figs 1c and 1d ) .",
    "each coordinate system ` follows one clustering ' , so we need to use various coordinate systems ( and this makes sense from a differential - geometric perspective ) . in 1-@xmath0 , if we take abc to be distinct from cba ( or abcd to be the same as dcba ) , our shapes are unoriented . in 2-@xmath0",
    "the same applies if clockwise readings around the perimeter are taken to be distinct from anticlockwise ones .",
    "if these things are taken to be the same , one is considering oriented shapes .",
    "if absolute scale is also to have no meaning , then one is left on a configuration space @xcite _ preshape space",
    "_ = @xmath34dil ( for dil the dilational group ) ; it is straightforward to see this to be @xmath35 .",
    "if absolute orientation ( in the rotational sense ) is also to have no meaning , then one is left on a configuration space _ relational space _",

    "[ the situation rapidly gets more complicated for increasing numbers of particles in 3-@xmath0 . ]",
    "the above also assumes each shape and its mirror image are considered distinct ( the ` plain ' choice of shapes ) ; if instead one were to identify each shape and its mirror image , one would be considering the ` oriented ' shapes , and one would get quotients of all of the above spaces by @xmath1 . among these ,",
    "the real projective spaces @xmath42 with inversive action } are well - known .",
    "i use an extra @xmath43 to denote the configuration spaces in this case , e.g. @xmath44(n , @xmath0 ) .",
    "next , consider these spaces at the level of riemannian geometry ( which gives a ` distance ' between relative configurations / shapes from the riemannian line element  a useful structure for timeless approaches such as the nave schrdinger interpretation or records theory ) .",

    "the oriented case has the half - range 0 to @xmath68 for @xmath69 , with reflective identification about the equator that makes it a hemisphere with boundary rather than a @xmath70 .",
    "thus the oriented 4-stop metroland and triangleland are mathematically distinct .",
    "the point of this is that , while we have the same mathematics as for the standard situation of a sphere in space , we now have this tractable mathematics alongside a new interpretation that makes this appropriate as a whole - universe toy model ( which is then highly soluble in many different ways ) .",
    "relational space @xmath74 can be viewed as the cone over shape space , @xmath75 . at the topological level , for c(x ) to be a cone over some topological manifold x , , where @xmath76 means that all points of the form ( p @xmath77 x , 0 @xmath78 ) are ` squashed ' or identified to a single point termed the _ cone point _ , and denoted by 0 . at the level of riemannian geometry",

    "another means of formulating the kind of mathematics arising in the relational program is , i.e. the cone over a topological space @xmath86 quotiented by a group @xmath4 ( which may be continuous , discrete or a mixture of both ) .",

    "a partial answer to whether cones are still definable over such is that acharya , atiyah and witten @xcite do talk about cones over weighted projective spaces , which can , at least in some cases , possess orbifold singularities .    finally , by the shape  scale split , shape space is both the entirety of the reduced configuration space for the scalefree theory and the shape part of the shape - scale split of the corresponding scaled theory .",

    "the discrepancy between the ` relational portion ' of newtonian mechanics s laplacian and that of the relationalspace - reduced approaches is due to the general formula for the laplacian ( [ lap ] ) containing @xmath345 which , in the former case , contains extra contributions from the absolute part even within the ` relational portion ' . by this means , if absolute space is assumed , it leaves an imprint on the ` relational portion ' .",
    "the effect of this is very loosely analogous to the issue of newton s bucket @xcite in the absolute versus relative motion debate ( with differences in shape of wavefunctions / probability densities in place of differences in the shape of the surface of the water ) .",
    "also note that the imprint of a 3-@xmath0 absolute space is different from that of a 2-@xmath0 absolute space ; the former is more complicated .",
    "it is in this way that the unusual operator ordering for the 3-body problem in the molecular physics literature ( e.g. @xcite and the much earlier but non - geometrical @xcite ) can be understood .",
    "e.g. from following through the chain of coordinate transformations in splitting 3-@xmath0 space into absolute and relative parts ( rather than eliminating , or never starting with , the absolute part ) , the radial part schrdinger equation comes out as @xmath346 , while purely relational considerations give the sphere with reflexive identification , for which the far more usual @xmath347 arises .",
    "[ in 3-@xmath0 the shape part also differs between the split of newtonian mechanics and the relationalspace approach ; see e.g. @xcite for various coordinatizations of the former s laplacian . ]",
    "note i. the two situations are physically distinct ( a molecule that is a small part of the universe versus a molecule that is a whole - universe model ) .",
    "nevertheless , i would be interested to know whether the form used in molecular physics has detailed experimental confirmation in the former context .",
    "the molecular physics literature does not , as far as i have seen , make a connection between this ordering issue and the absolute versus relative motion ; i mention here that the extent to which aharonov and kaufherr s @xcite work is related both to the situation in molecular physics _ and _ to the above absolute versus relative motion debate issue represents interesting work in progress .",
    "the purely relational operator ordering that i adopt has the added theoretical advantages of having    ( well-)known solutions in a number of cases , and of being in line with a number of authors choice of operator ordering for the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation .",
    "monopole issues are known to affect classical , and in particular , quantum - mechanical , study of a system .",
    "e.g. consider a charged particle in 3-@xmath0 [ for which cartesian coordinates are @xmath348 in cartesian coordinates and ( @xmath136 , @xmath349 , @xmath350 ) in spherical polar coordinates , with corresponding mechanical momentum @xmath351 , @xmath352 is its mass and @xmath353 is its charge ] in the presence of a dirac monopole @xcite of monopole strength @xmath354 , corresponding to field strength f _ = _ gx^/r^3 . [ fist ] if one looks for a vector potential @xmath197 corresponding to this in just the one chart , one finds that it is singular somewhere  the monopole has a dirac string emanating from it in some direction or other .",
    "however , there is no physical content in the direction in which it emanates , and one can avoid having such strings by using more than one chart ( each chart s choice of dirac string lying outside the chart ) .",
    "one such choice is to have an n - chart @xmath355 , and an s - chart @xmath356 , with the vector potential in each of these being given by ^ = g\\{x^1 x^2 - x^2 x^1}/r\\{r + x^3 } , ^ = g\\{x^1 x^2 - x^2 x^1}/r\\{r - x^3 } .",
    "then the classical hamiltonian for the charged particle is built from the canonical momentum combination @xmath357 : = \\ { - e}^2/2 m + v ( ) , with @xmath197 taking the above monopole form , i.e. @xmath358 in the n - chart and @xmath359 in the s - chart .",
    "then the position and the canonical momentum are good hermitian operators , but next in looking to form @xmath273(3 ) objects , @xmath197 s positional dependence complicates the commutation relations ; this necessitates , beyond what is usual in angular momenta , the introduction of an extra term : ^ = \\ { - e } - q / r^3 , q = eg = nc/2 ( the last equality being the dirac quantization condition ) .",
    "next , @xmath360 , and @xmath361 in the n - chart and @xmath362 in the s - chart , so @xmath10 has an exp@xmath363 factor rather than an exp@xmath364 factor , with integer m @xmath365 @xmath366 .",
    "consequently , the azimuthal part of the schrdinger equation then picks up two extra terms : - \\{_}^-1 \\ { _ , _ _ } , _ _",
    "+ \\{_}^-2\\{+ q_}^2 = \\{\\{+ 1 } - q^2 } , and so that ` monopole harmonics ' replace the ordinary spherical harmonics ( @xcite ; e.g. @xcite has a 2-@xmath0 counterpart of closer relevance to the present paper ) .",
    "n.b . however how this working collapses in the case of an uncharged particle : the monopole is then not ` felt ' so one has the mathematically - usual particle hamiltonian , the mathematically - usual form of the @xmath273(3 ) operator , the mathematically - usual schrdinger equation and , for central potentials ( i.e. potentials depending on the radial variable @xmath136 alone ) , the mathematically - usual spherical harmonics .",
    "this difference from @xcite is one reason why @xcite has had to wait for the below resolution .",
    "now , monopole issues involving the triple collision are somewhat well - known to occur in 3-body problem configuration spaces . in the case of rpm",
    "s , is the above an indication of somewhat unusual mathematics arising analogously to in the above dirac monopole considerations ?",
    "i begin by considering this for unoriented scaled triangleland in the newtonian context of this sitting inside absolute space .",
    "firstly , the connection involved in this case is guichardet s @xcite rotational connection ( c.f .",
    "ssec 1 of appendix ) .",
    "this is indeed a nontrivial connection as it has a nontrivial field strength ( [ nontri ] ) . in this case , passing to e.g. @xmath367 coordinates gives precisely the dirac monopole ( [ fist ] ) under the correspondence @xmath367 for @xmath140 , clustering ( 1 ) s d in the role of n and its m in that of s.    next , the hamiltonian is ( for relational space coordinates @xmath368 with corresponding mechanical momenta @xmath369 ) = ^-1 + g^\\{p _ - _ } \\{p _ - _ } /2",
    "[ bigham ] from here , monopole effects would spread into the schrdinger equation and its solutions .",
    "however the key point is that the case of interest in rpm s is the one with _",
    "zero total angular momentum _",
    "@xmath370 , for which , analogously to the special case of an uncharged particle in a dirac monopole field , the hamiltonian ( [ bigham ] ) collapses to a much simpler form , = g^p_p_/2 + v(q^ ) corresponding to ` not feeling ' the monopole .",
    "thus monopole effects do not enter the schrdinger equation and its solutions in this way ( nor does a distinction between mechanical and canonical momentum change the form of the relative rational momentum operator in this case of zero total angular momentum ) .",
    "thus the associated @xmath273(3 ) mathematics is standard , and , in the case of a ` central ' potential energy @xmath371 , the angular part of the schrdinger equation does indeed give the spherical harmonics ( determining this requires additional working due to operator ordering issues , which is provided in the next sec ) .",
    "thus the scalefree rpm study of these in @xcite turns out to be reuseable in the study of the scaled triangle as the shape part of the shape - scale split .",
    "note furthermore that if we choose , rather , oriented shapes ( much more common in the literature due to the bias that the real world is 3-@xmath0 and one can therefore in this setting perform out - of the - plane rotations on a planar system ) , the monopole is not now of dirac - type in 3-@xmath0 space but rather iwai s monopole @xcite in 3-@xmath0 half - space .",
    "the mathematics remains similar to that of the dirac monopole in any given chart and gauge , however now other choices of string are more convenient @xcite ( and the flux is halved due to involving half as much solid angle as before ) . in particular , the hamiltonian remains of the form ( [ bigham ] ) and the above simplification to this and to the subsequent qm for zero total angular momentum continues to apply ( now involving some ` half - sphere harmonics ' rather than whole - sphere ones ) .",
    "for more than three particles , the above simplifying effect of being in a @xmath332 theory ( a useful result e.g. toward developing the quadrilateralland model ) , though i have not as yet considered in these cases whether the @xmath372 coincides with the metric obtained from first principles / from reduction of @xcite - type formulations .",
    "given that we straightforwardly eliminated the translations early on in this paper s treatment , i should next reassure the reader that , if these were left behind , they would not bring about a significant analogous connection to that brought about by the rotations .",
    "this is because , as a further manifestation of the mathematical simpleness of the translations , their analogue of the guichardet connection form has trivial field strength ( ssec 2 of appendix ) .",
    "thus we can be sure that for scaled n - stop metroland ( involving at most translations ) , one does not have monopole effects to worry about .",
    "this protects my treatment of n - stop metroland as ` ordinary euclidean space physics ' , among the coordinate systems for which the ( ( ultra)spherical ) polar coordinates have a particularly lucid scale - shape interpretation .",
    "next , in the case of scalefree theories , can the dilations cause analogous monopole effects ?",
    "i establish in ssec 2 of the appendix that this is not the case because their analogue of the guichardet connection form also has trivial field strength . thus combining this result and the above rotational results , scalefree theories carry no vestiges of the excluded maximal collision through its action as a monopole ( without establishing this , one could have feared e.g. that the shape spaces could contain a bad point of gauge - dependent position arising from the corresponding relationalspace s gauge and chart choice s dirac string casting a ` shadow ' on the shape space at the point intersection in relationalspace between the dirac string and the surrounding shape space , c.f .",
    "[ finally , translations , rotations and dilations do not interfere with each other if treated together in this sense . ]",
    "srpm has a lot of potential freedom ( all potentials homogeneous of degree 0 are allowed ) , while erpm can have any potential at all .",
    "moreover , what is effectively erpm ( the zero total angular momentum portion of newtonian mechanics ) describes much of later - universe physics @xcite .",
    "there is however a gap in that doing _ quantum _ cosmology is nt exactly later - universe physics , albeit kucha has also argued @xcite that halliwell and hawking s perturbative treatment of inhomogeneous gr is likewise only a model of quantum cosmology , quantum fluctuations being far smaller than the classical universe s inhomogeneities . in models with inflation ,",
    "this criticism may at least in part be circumvented .",
    "hitherto , the rpm program has been using ho potentials ( or ho - like ones for srpm , for which ho potentials themselves are disallowed by the homogeneity requirement ) .",
    "these are @xmath373 for 3-stop metroland ,    @xmath374 for 4-stop metroland , and @xmath375 for triangleland in the flat banal representation , which is also accompanied by a @xmath376 term .",
    "these include well shapes about poles ( @xmath377 = 0 case ) @xcite . with scale added , c.f .",
    "@xcite for triangleland : one has an infinite well or an infinite barrier depending on the sign of @xmath182 .",

    "however , it is a main point of this paper to use the analogy between mechanics and cosmology to broaden the range of potentials under consideration and pinpoint ones which parallel classical and quantum cosmology well .",

    "also , @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath384 is the spatial curvature which is without loss of generality normalizable to 1 , 0 or 1 , and @xmath308 is the mass enclosed up to the radius @xmath385 .",
    "on the other hand , conservative mechanics of one particle in 3-@xmath0 and in spherical polar coordinates , has an energy constraint , which , divided by @xmath386 takes the form \\{}^2 = - - .",
    "thus there is an analogy between friedmann _ after solution of raychaudhuri or energy - momentum conservation _ and mechanics . in this ,  @xmath387 plays the same role as curvature ( and can again without loss of generality be set to 1 , 0 or 1 ) .",
    "the shapefree part of @xmath388 ( ` newtonian ' ) potentials are likewise analogous to dust . the shapefree part of @xmath107 ( ` ho ' ) potentials are analogous to the cosmological constant .",

    ", this still has @xmath389 equation of state ( for @xmath390 the pressure ) , but @xmath79 is negative .",

    "moreover , this ` wrong - sign radiation ' term is entirely expected in mechanics ( it is the centrifugal barrier preventing collapse so that one indeed expects a ` bounce ' rather than collapse to singular behaviour like a friedmann model s big bang singularity ) .",
    "this difference in sign can be seen as originating from an important limitation in the mechanics  cosmology analogy : expansion in gr contributes negatively to kinetic energy while it does so positively in mechanics . in this paper , this can be absorbed by reversing all the ( pseudo)potential signs and the sign of the overall energy (  2@xmath182 in place of @xmath384 ) ; note that the shape terms in the rpm kinetic energy are of the same sign as the scale term , while in gr they are of opposite sign ; it is from this that the radiation - like term gets the ` wrong sign ' .",
    "finally , note that one can suppress this term if one s model s relative rational momentum is zero / small / swamped by the following contribution to the potential .",
    "ordinary radiation fluid , whether because one wishes for models paralleling universes for which a such is significant , or so as to cancel / outweigh the wrong - sign radiation term that is _ mechanically _ well - motivated , can be brought about by inclusion of a @xmath391 ( ` conformally invariant ' ) potential term .",
    "this is the conformally invariant potential term @xmath391 , which is quite well - studied in classical and quantum mechanics .",

    "moreover , n.b . that isotropic cosmology itself similarly suppresses small anisotropies and inhomogeneities , so that exact solutions thereof are really approximate solutions for more realistic universes too .      in considering a large number of particles ,",
    "another way in which shape could be at least approximately negligible arises @xcite : through its overall averaging out to produce a highly radial problem ( in a factorization into a cosmology - like scale problem and a shape problem ) . in the case of dust in 3-@xmath0 , the many newtonian gravity potential terms average out to produce the effective dust , and one s equations",

    "it is an interesting question to me whether the averaging out to produce a radial equation and a shape equation occurs for other power - law potentials and their superpositions and whether any of the resulting shape problems are of mathematical form that has been substantially studied before .",
    "i currently give preference to analogue models of realistic cosmologies over models that are well - known from the mechanics / molecular physics literatures , as the virtues of rpm s that i intend to exploit are in their being toy models for whole universe gr , and i argue that using up rpm s freedom of potential to make their scale dynamics approximately match that of realistic gr cosmology models is a useful way to further enhance the analogy . now , instead of such a scale dynamics being coupled to a complicated gr structure formation process , it is coupled to a simpler structure formation process that is finite and tied to well - studied configuration space geometry ( e.g. @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) , which , nevertheless is still of value as regards the investigation of a number of conceptual issues such as the problem of time in quantum gravity .",

    "these two schemes coincide in the 1- and 2-@xmath0 cases investigated in the present paper , as reducing the latter reproduces the former . moreover , there are differences between these coincident schemes and the relational - absolute split of newtonian mechanics ( although these share much useful kinematics , in particular as regards finding useful coordinate systems , e.g. jacobi coordinates and dragt - type coordinates ) .",
    "firstly , rpm s have zero total angular momentum , which within newtonian mechanics is a simpler and qualitatively different case from nonzero total angular momentum .",
    "nonzero total angular momentum newtonian mechanics e.g. gives rise to configuration space monopole defects associated with guichardet - type connections stemming from the rotation group , but these are absent in the zero total angular momentum case in analogy with how uncharged particles do not ` feel ' magnetic monoples .",
    "[ i have also established that translational and dilational analogues of the guichardet connection are trivial and so do not contribute any further defect issues relevant to rpm s . ] secondly , even for the zero total angular momentum case , i point out that there is a difference between the relational part of relational - absolute split mechanics and purely relational mechanics at the level of the quantum - mechanical operator ordering ; the first is that used in the molecular physics literature , while the second is coincident , or closely related to , operator orderings that are fairly commonly used in quantum cosmology [ laplacian ordering , conformal ordering and @xmath323-ordering : @xmath532 .",
    "this is interesting from the perspective of the ` absolute versus relative motion ' debate .",
    "it reflects that there is an ` absolute imprint ' difference between the case in which some particles constituting a molecule within absolute space ( or , implicitly , a much larger universe with local conditions being conducive to having a nice stable reference system as is the case e.g. on earth ) and the case in which the same particles constituting a whole model universe .",
    "n.b . that this difference is present even in the simpler and qualitatively distinct case of zero total angular momentum ( for which , on the one hand , the split of newtonian mechanics simplifies , and , on the other hand , explicit relational models are actually available for comparison . )    unlike in minisuperspace models , scalefree rpm",
    "s have considerable freedom in the form of the potential and scaled rpm s have complete freedom .",
    "i elect to use up this freedom by choosing potentials which closely parallel those for various well - known gr cosmologies ; in particular , i choose to emulate the ` dominant scale dynamics ' part of cosmological models by matching choice of potential , and let this naturally induce what the shape part of the potential is to be .",
    "this parallel is via the mechanics  cosmology analogy as applied to rpm s , which works out differently for each of n - stop metroland and triangleland due to the difference in radial variable between these two cases . for 1-d rpm s and the @xmath6 presentation of 2-d rpm s , the analogy that @xmath395 corresponds to the spatial curvature @xmath384 .",
    "a combination of hooke s coefficients from the ( upside - down ) ho terms , @xmath533 , corresponds to the cosmological constant term @xmath534 . in particular , i identify previous work on ( upside down ) ho ( type ) potentials @xcite as corresponding to the ` milne in anti de sitter ' oscillating cosmological model and de sitter / inflationary type models in the case of zero rational momentum and with extra wrong - sign radiation in the nonzero rational momentum case .",
    "@xmath535  minus the total relative rational momentum  corresponds to a cosmological radiation term , but of the ` wrong sign ' ; @xmath536 is the overall right - or - wrong sign radiation term , @xmath537 being the surviving term from the conformally - invariant potential terms @xmath538 in the case of approximate negligibility of shape terms , and corresponding to the matter term for radiation , @xmath539 .",
    "if this term is large enough , one has overall a right - sign radiation term .",
    "@xmath540  the surviving term from newtonian potential terms @xmath541 in the case of approximate negligibility of shape terms  corresponds to a dust matter term , @xmath542 .    for the spherical presentation of triangleland , however , while @xmath535 and the surviving term from @xmath543 potentials play the same roles again , it is @xmath396 that now plays the role of spatial curvature @xmath384 , and so is conventionally rescaled to be 1 , 0 or 1 ( which rescaling applies implicitly also throughout all the other triangleland  cosmology analogies ) .",
    "the energy @xmath182 now plays the role of @xmath544 for dust , and the surviving term from @xmath545 potentials plays the role of the cosmological constant term @xmath534 .",
    "the problem with @xmath182 and @xmath344 only maps to the newton - coulomb problem ( both attractive and repulsive signs can occur ) ; for zero rational momentum this is a dust and curvature universe while for nonzero rational momentum , it has also a wrong - sign radiation term . adding enough counterbalancing @xmath546 turns this into a right - sign radiation term .",
    "inclusion of radiation terms is desirable as regards modelling simple hot early universes ; ` wrong signs ' here do also occur in some more conventionally exotic scenarios involving ` dark radiation ' @xcite .",
    "inclusion of cosmological constant terms allow for rpm s to e.g. mimic simple inflationary universes ( and simple models of late - universe acceleration ) .",
    "i present the qm of n - stop metroland in @xcite , and that of triangleland in @xcite ; these are supported by the present paper s operator ordering and lack of monopole effect results , as well as considering some of the present paper s new cosmologically - motivated potentials .",
    "i also compare dirac and reduced / relationalspace approaches in @xcite . if sec 10.3 s applications prove to be fruitful for n - stop metroland and triangleland , i will also consider the quadrilateral that unifies the most useful aspects of 4-stop metroland and triangleland ; a brief kinematical study of quadrilateralland will be presented in @xcite .",
    "i also note that c(@xmath547 ) and c(@xmath548 ) are rather less trivial than c(@xmath99 ) and c(@xmath549 ) making the present paper and its extension to these further examples of long - term importance to the rpm program .",
    "for the abovementioned range of potentials and subsequent ( approximate ) classical solutions for the scale part , i consider what the approximate timestandards for the semiclassical approach are",
    ". the further issue of in what regions of configuration space various conditions for the semiclassical approach apply well , i address in @xcite using the tessellation by the physical interpretation method provided in the present paper and in @xcite . the resulting time - dependent schrdinger equation for the light , fast l - part is simplest if one passes to the rectified emergent time as provided in the present paper . solving the resulting time - dependent schrdinger equation ( with further approximations being allowable as rectified emergent time dependent perturbations )",
    "i consider in @xcite ( with a small foretaste in @xcite ) .",
    "solving this coupled to a less approximate h equation ( small qm expectation type perturbations about a hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation ) , which is perhaps to be seen as @xcite ( an extension of ) the well - known hartree ",
    "fock approach to atomic and molecular physics , is a more complicated such scheme that allows for backreaction of the l subsystem on the h one and the approximate timestandard that it provides . throughout the above",
    ", checks against ulteriorly exactly soluble cases documented in @xcite are useful checks of the semiclassical approach s assumptions and approximations ; moreover , such ulterior exact solvability is seldom available in minisuperspace . also , the relative simpleness of the l - dynamics of shape for rpm s is useful in investigating various of the above - outlined features .",
    "thus , rpm s may be viewed as valuable toy models of midisuperspace quantum cosmology models tied to the origin of structure formation in the universe ( e.g. the halliwell  hawking model toward quantum cosmology seeding galaxy formation and cmb inhomogeneities ) .",
    "[ thus rpm s are valuable conceptually and to test whether we should or should not be _ qualitatively _ confident in the assumptions and approximations made in such schemes .",

    "the present paper s ` 52 analogies between rpm s and gr - as - geometrodynamics ' section contains a number of further questions about problem of time and foundations of quantum cosmology including the problem of observables , the issue of uniform states , the origin of the arrow of time and robustness issues as regards neglecting some of a model universe s modes .",
