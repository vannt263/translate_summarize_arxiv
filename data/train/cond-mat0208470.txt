    "one of the classical problems of statistical physics , and physical chemistry , is to find a macroscopic statistical description for the diffusion of a dissolved molecule or ion in a uniform fluid solvent .",
    "the microscopic state of such a system has very many degrees of freedom , possibly even more than an avogadro number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives rise to an equally large number of coupled equations of motion .",
    "it is completely impractical to solve such a large system with rigor .",
    "we must abandon the idea of an exact solution .",
    "we are forced to use a statistical description , where we can only describe the probability of certain events .",
    "we denote the probability of finding a brownian particle at a certain point on space , @xmath0 , and time , @xmath1 , by @xmath2 .",
    "the time - evolution of @xmath3 is governed by a partial differential equation called the fokker - planck equation : @xmath4    the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are referred to as the infinitesimal first and second moments of diffusion . in practice ,",
    "the infinitesimal second moment does sometimes depend on concentration of the solute , @xmath3 , but is usually regarded as constant and is called the `` fick s law constant . '' a typical value ( for a hydrated sodium ion in water ) would be of the order @xmath7 .",
    "the infinitesimal first moment depends on the magnitude of externally imposed forces and on the mobility of the brownian particle which is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electrical charge on the particle , @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity of the solvent and @xmath11 is the effective radius of the particle .",
    "a typical value for the mobility ( of a hydrated sodium ion in water ) would be @xmath12 .",
    "further descriptions and numerical data may be found in books on physical chemistry and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "if we apply an electrical potential , or voltage , of @xmath13 then the infinitesimal first moment is given by @xmath14 the theory behind equations [ eq : mobility ] and [ eq : infinitesimal_first_moment ] is due to stokes and einstein @xcite .",
    "more information about the methods of solution and the applications of the fokker - planck equation can be found in risken @xcite .",
    "when we take into account the functional forms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 then we can rewrite the fokker - planck equation as : @xmath17 this is the form of the fokker - plank equation which we will sample at regular intervals in time and space , to yield finite difference equations .",
    "many partial differential equations , or pdes , including equation [ eq : expanded_fokker_planck ] , can be very difficult to solve analytically .",
    "one well established approach to this problem is to sample possible solutions to a pde at regular intervals , called mesh points @xcite .",
    "the true solution is approximated locally by a collocating polynomial .",
    "the values of the derivatives of the true solution are approximated by the corresponding derivatives of the collocating polynomial .",

    "time , @xmath1 , and position , @xmath0 , are modelled by real numbers , @xmath21 and the corresponding sampled position , @xmath22 , and sampled time , @xmath23 , are modelled by integers @xmath24 .",
    "we sample the space using a simple linear relationship @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sampling length and @xmath27 is the sampling time .    in order to map equation [ eq : expanded_fokker_planck ] into discrete space",
    ", we need to make suitable finite difference approximations to the partial derivatives .",
    "the notation is greatly simplified if we define a family of difference operators : @xmath28 in principle , this is a doubly infinite family of operators but in practice we only use a small finite subset of these operators .",
    "this is determined by our choice of sampling points .",
    "this choice is not unique and is not trivial .",
    "the set of sampling points is called a `` computational molecule @xcite . ''",
    "some choices lead to over - determined sets of equation with no solution . some other choices",
    "lead to under - determined sets of equations with infinitely many solutions .",
    "we chose a computational molecule called `` explicit '' computation with the following sample points : @xmath29 .",
    "we also need to make a choice regarding the form of the local collocating polynomial .",
    "this is not unique and inappropriate choices do not lead to unique solutions .",
    "a polynomial which is quadratic in @xmath0 and linear in @xmath1 is the simplest feasible choice : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the real coefficients of the polynomial .",
    "equations [ eq : sample ] , [ eq : difference ] and [ eq : polynomial ] imply a simple system of linear equations that can be expressed in matrix form : @xmath34 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }       a_1 \\\\       a_2 \\\\       b_1 \\end{array } \\right ] =     \\left [     \\begin{array}{c }         \\delta_{-1,-1 } \\\\",

    "equations [ eq : a_1 ] , [ eq : a_2 ] , [ eq : b_1 ] form a complete and consistent set .",
    "we could not change one without adjusting the others .",
    "we can evaluate the derivatives of equation [ eq : polynomial ] to obtain a complete and consistent set of finite difference approximations for the partial derivatives : @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can apply the same procedure to @xmath5 to obtain @xmath41    equations [ eq : dpdz ] , [ eq : d2pdz2 ] , [ eq : dpdt ] and [ eq : dalphadz ] can be substituted into equation [ eq : expanded_fokker_planck ] to yield the required finite partial difference equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 we can overload the arguments of @xmath46 and write them in terms of the discrete space @xmath20 using the mapping defined in equation [ eq : sample ] . @xmath47 the meaning of the arguments should be clear from the context and from the use of subscript notation , @xmath48 , rather than function notation , @xmath49 .",
    "equation [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] is precisely the form required for parrondo s games .",
    "in the original formulation , the conditional probabilities of winning or losing depend on the state , @xmath22 , of capital but not on any other information about the past history of the games :    *  game a is a toss of a biased coin :   @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an adverse external bias that the game has to `` overcome '' .",
    "this bias , @xmath51 , is typically a small number such as @xmath52 , for example @xcite . *  game b depends on the capital , @xmath22 :   + if @xmath53 : :    ,  then the odds are unfavorable .",
    "@xmath54 if @xmath55 : :    ,  then the odds are favorable .",
    "@xmath56    it is straightforward to simulate a randomized sequence of these games on a computer using a very simple algorithm @xcite .",
    "we can write the requirements for game a in the form of equation [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] .",
    "@xmath57 this implies a constraint that @xmath58 which implies that @xmath59 which defines the relative scales of @xmath26 and @xmath27 so we can give it a special name : @xmath60    the constraints on @xmath61 and @xmath62 imply a value for parrondo s `` @xmath51 '' parameter : @xmath63 which can be related back to an externally imposed electric field , @xmath64 using equations [ eq : mobility ] and [ eq : infinitesimal_first_moment ] : @xmath65 the small bias , @xmath51 , is proportional to the applied external field which justifies parrondo s original intuition .",
    "there is still zero probability of remaining in the same state which implies a constraint that @xmath58 which implies that we still have the same scale , @xmath66 .",
    "if we are in state @xmath22 then we can denote the probability of winning by + @xmath67 .",
    "we can write the difference equations for game b in the form : @xmath68 which , together with equations [ eq : am1 ] , [ eq : a0 ] and [ eq : ap1 ] , gives @xmath69 which implies that @xmath70 this can be combined with equation [ eq : infinitesimal_first_moment ] and then directly integrated to calculate the required voltage profile .",
    "we can approximate the integral with a riemann sum : @xmath71 so we can construct the required voltage profile for the ratchet which means that , given the values of @xmath72 , it is possible to construct a physical brownian ratchet that has a finite difference approximation which is identical with parrondo s games .",
    "we can conclude that parrondo s games are literally a finite element model of a flashing brownian ratchet .",
    "we note that game b , as defined here , is quite general and actually includes game a as a special case .",
    "we would like to think that as long as @xmath73 is preserved then the solution to the finite partial difference equation [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] would converge to the true solution of the partial differential equation [ eq : expanded_fokker_planck ] , as the mesh size , @xmath26 goes to zero .",
    "fortunately , there is a theorem due to obrien , hyman and kaplan @xcite which establishes that the numerical integration of a parabolic pde , in explicit form , will converge to the correct solution as @xmath74 and @xmath75 provided @xmath76 .",
    "similar results may also be found in standard texts on numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "we see that parrondo s choice of diffusion operator , with @xmath66 is at the very edge of the stable region .",
    "there is a possible range of values for @xmath77 .",
    "as @xmath78 we require the time step @xmath75 which means that the number of time steps required to simulate a given time interval , @xmath79 , increases without bound @xmath80 .",
    "it is computationally infeasible to perform simulations with very small values of @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath81 implied in parrondo s games is at the very limit of stability .",
    "in fact , the presence of small roundoff errors in the arithmetic could cause the the discrete simulation to diverge significantly from the continuous solution .",
    "we propose that choosing @xmath82 , in the middle of the feasible range , is most appropriate .",
    "if we consider the case of pure diffusion , with @xmath83 , then equation [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] reduces to @xmath84 and if we choose @xmath82 then this reduces to @xmath85 which is the same as pascal s triangle with every second row removed .",
    "the solution to the case where the initial condition is a kronecker delta function , @xmath86 is easy to calculate : @xmath87 which is a half period , or double frequency , binomial .",
    "we can invoke the laplace and de moivre form of the central limit theorem which establishes a correspondence between binomial ( or bernoulli ) distribution and the gaussian distribution to obtain @xmath88 this expression is only approximate but is true in the limiting case as @xmath89 .    in the case where @xmath90 ; the fokker planck equation [ eq : expanded_fokker_planck ] reduces to a diffusion equation : @xmath91 einstein s solution to the diffusion equation is a gaussian probability density function : @xmath92 where the variance , @xmath93 , is a linear function of time : @xmath94 it is possible to verify that this is a solution by direct substitution : @xmath95 if we sample this solution in equation [ eq : gaussian ] using the mapping in equation [ eq : sample ] then we obtain equation [ eq : laplace_demoivre ] again .",
    "this is an exact result .",
    "we conclude that the choice of @xmath96 is very appropriate for the solution to the diffusion equation .",
    "we suggest that this would also be true for the fokker - planck equation , in the case where @xmath16 is `` small . ''",
    "the appropriate choice of @xmath77 , given arbitrarily large , or rapidly varying , @xmath16 is still an unsolved problem . in general",
    ", we would expect that much smaller values , @xmath97 , would be needed to accommodate more extreme choices of alpha .",
    "we simulated a physically reasonable ratchet with a moderately large modulo value , @xmath98 .",
    "( the value for the original parrondo s games was @xmath99 . ) we used the value of @xmath82 .",
    "the simulation was based on a direct implementation of equation [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] in matlab .",
    "we chose a sampling time of @xmath100 and a sampling distance of @xmath101 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : simulation ] , where we indicate how the expected position of a particle can move within a brownian flashing ratchet during four cycles of the modulating field .",
    "we can see a steady drift of the mean position of the particle in response to the ratchet action .",
    "this simulation includes a total of 500 time samples .",
    "note that the average rate of transport quickly settles down to a steady value , even after only four cycles of the ratchet .",
    "we acknowledge the similar , but independent , work of heath @xcite et al .",
    "the focus of our paper is different . we seek to establish the physical , and mathematical , basis of parrondo s games and to derive a practical numerical technique for simulation .",
    "we conclude that parrondo s games _ are _ a valid finite - element simulation of a flashing brownian ratchet , which justifies parrondo s original intuition . we have established that parrondo s `` @xmath51 '' parameter is a reasonable way to simulate a gradual externally imposed electric field , or voltage gradient .",
    "we have established that parrondo s implied choice of the @xmath77 parameter does lead to a stable simulation but we suggest that the choice of @xmath82 is more appropriate from a mathematical point of view .    finally , we have generalised parrondo s games , in the form of a set of finite difference equations [ eq : integer_partial_difference_equation ] and we have shown that these can be implemented on a computer .",
