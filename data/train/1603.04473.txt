    "the study of complex networks has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "it was found that network models provide a useful description of a large number of processes which involve interacting objects @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the objects are represented by nodes and the interactions are expressed by edges .",
    "pairs of adjacent nodes can affect each other directly . however , the interactions between most pairs of nodes are indirect , mediated by intermediate nodes and edges",
    ".    a pair of nodes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , may be connected by a large number of paths .",
    "the shortest among these paths are of particular importance because they are likely to provide the fastest and strongest interaction .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study the distribution of shortest path lengths ( dspl ) between pairs of nodes in different types of networks",
    ". such distributions , which are also referred to as distance distributions , are expected to depend on the network structure and size .",
    "they are of great importance for the temporal evolution of dynamical processes on networks , such as signal propagation @xcite , navigation @xcite and epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "central measures of the dspl such as the average distance between pairs of nodes , and extremal measures such as the diameter were studied @xcite .",
    "however , apart from a few studies @xcite , the entire dspl has attracted little attention .",
    "recently , an analytical approach was developed for calculating the dspl @xcite in the erds - rnyi ( er ) network , which is the simplest mathematical model of a random network @xcite . using recursion equations , analytical results for the dspl",
    "were obtained in different regimes , including sparse and dense networks of small as well as asymptotically large sizes .",
    "the resulting distributions were found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "er networks are random graphs in which the degrees follow a poisson distribution and there are no degree - degree correlations between connected pairs of nodes .",
    "in fact , er networks can be considered as a maximum entropy ensemble under the constraint that the mean degree is fixed .",
    "moreover , there is a much broader class of networks , named the configuration model , which generates maximum entropy ensembles when the entire degree distribution is constrained @xcite .",
    "the er ensemble is equivalent to a configuration model in which the degree distribution is constrained to be a poisson distribution . for any given degree distribution",
    ", one can produce an ensemble of configuration model networks and perform a statistical analysis of its properties .",
    "therefore , the configuration model provides a general and highly powerful platform for the analysis of networks .",
    "it is the ideal model to use as a null model when one tries to analyze an empirical network of which the degree distribution is known . for a given empirical network ,",
    "one constructs a configuration model network of the same size and the same degree distribution .",
    "properties of interest such as the dspl @xcite , the betweenness centrality @xcite and the abundance of network motifs @xcite are compared between the two networks .",
    "the differences provide a rigorous test of the systematic features of the empirical network vs. the random network .",
    "a theoretical framework for the study of the shell structure in configuration model networks was developed in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "the shell structure around the largest hub in a scale free network was analyzed in ref .",
    "this approach was later extended into a general theory of the shell structure arond a random node in a configuration model network @xcite .",
    "this formulation is based on recursion equations for the number of nodes in each shell and for the degree distributions in the shells . in the special case of the er network , the results of refs .",
    "@xcite for the number of nodes in each shell coincide with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the shell structure around a random node in the configuration model",
    "was recently utilized for the study of epidemic spreading @xcite . in a study of biological networks ,",
    "the dspl in a protein - protein interaction network was analyzed and compared to a corresponding configuration model network @xcite .",
    "it was found that the distances in the configuration model are shorter than in the original empirical network .",
    "this highlights the features of the biological network which tend to increase the distances .",
    "these studies demonstrate the applicability of the configuration model in the analysis of the structure and dynamics in empirical networks .    in this paper we develop a theoretical framework , based on the cavity approach @xcite , for the calculation of the dspl in networks which belong to the configuration model class . using this framework we derive recursion equations for the calculation of the dspl in configuration model networks .",
    "we apply these equations to networks with degenerate , binomial and power - law degree distributions , and show that the results are in good agreement with numerical simulations . using the tail - sum formula we calculate the mean and the variance of the dspl . evaluating the discrete derivative of the tail distribution , we also obtain the mode of the dspl .",
    "these results provide closed form expressions for the central measures and dispersion measures of the dspl in terms of the moments of the degree distribution and the size of the network , illuminating the connection between the two distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "v we present the results obtained from the recursion equations for different network models and compare them to numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "vi we present a summary of the results .",
    "the configuration model is a maximum entropy ensemble of networks under the condition that the degree distribution is imposed @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the case of undirected networks , in which all the edges are bidirectional .",
    "to construct such a network of @xmath2 nodes , one can draw the degrees of all nodes from a desired degree distribution @xmath3 , @xmath4 , producing the degree sequence @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 must be even ) .",

    "the mean degree over the ensemble of networks is @xmath9 , while the average degree for a single instance of the network is @xmath10 .",
    "here we consider networks which do not include isolated nodes , namely @xmath11 .",
    "this does not affect the applicability of the results , since the distribution of shortest path lengths is evaluated only for pairs of nodes which reside on the same cluster , for which the distance is finite . actually , if a network includes isolated nodes",
    ", one can discard them by considering a renormalized degree distribution of the form @xmath12 $ ] , for @xmath13 .    a convenient way to construct a configuration model network",
    "is to prepare the @xmath2 nodes such that each node , @xmath0 , is connected to @xmath5 half edges @xcite .",
    "pairs of half edges from different nodes are then chosen randomly and are connected to each other in order to form the network .",
    "the result is a network with the desired degree sequence but no correlations .",
    "note that towards the end of the construction the process may get stuck .",
    "this may happen in case that the only remaining pairs of half edges are in the same node or in nodes which are already connected to each other .",
    "in such cases one may perform some random reconnections in order to enable completion of the construction .",
    "consider a random pair of nodes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in a network of @xmath2 nodes .",
    "assuming that the two nodes reside on the same connected cluster , they are likely to be connected by a large number of paths . here",
    "we focus on the shortest among these paths ( possibly more than one ) .",
    "more specifically , we derive recursion equations for the length distribution of these shortest paths . to this end",
    "we introduce the indicator function    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the length of the shortest path between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and @xmath16 is an integer .",
    "we also introduce the conditional indicator function    @xmath17    under the condition that the length @xmath15 is larger than @xmath18 , this function indicates whether @xmath15 is also larger than @xmath16 . if it is , the conditional indicator function @xmath19 , otherwise ( namely if @xmath20 ) @xmath21 . in case",
    "the condition @xmath22 is not satisfied , the value of the conditional indicator function is undetermined . in order to extend this definition",
    "we adopt the convention that in case the condition is not satisfied the conditional indicator function takes the value @xmath23 .",
    "we note that all the subsequent results are independent of the value adopted here .",
    "the indicator function @xmath24 can be expressed as a product of the conditional indicator functions in the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to be two different nodes .    in the analysis below",
    "we calculate the mean of the indicator function over an ensemble of networks to obtain the distribution of shortest path lengths @xmath27 . to this end",
    "we define the mean conditional indicator function @xmath28 $ ] , obtained by averaging the conditional indicator function @xmath29 over all suitable choices of the final node , @xmath1 :    @xmath30    the averaging is done only over nodes @xmath1 which reside on the same cluster as node @xmath0 and for which the condition @xmath31 is satisfied .",
    "a path of length @xmath16 from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 can be decomposed into a single edge connecting node @xmath0 and node @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the set of all nodes directly connected to @xmath0 ) , and a shorter path of length @xmath18 connecting @xmath34 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the existence of a path of length @xmath16 between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be ruled out if there is no path of length @xmath18 between any of the nodes @xmath32 , and @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "in the range @xmath195 we find that the mode is of order @xmath98 , namely independent of @xmath2 , which is even shorter than @xmath230 .",
    "this is consistent with the ultrasmall scaling of the mean , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the mode is expected to be smaller than the mean and less sensitive to extreme values .",
    "we presented a theoretical framework for the calculation of the distributions of shortest path lengths between random pairs of nodes in configuration model networks .",
    "this framework , which is based on recursion equations derived using the cavity approach , provides analytical results for the distribution of shortest path lengths .",
    "we used the recursion equations to study a broad class of configuration model networks , with degree distributions that follow the degenerate , binomial and power - law distributions .",
    "the results were shown to be in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "the mean , mode and variance of the distribution of shortest path lengths were also evaluated and expressed in terms of moments of the degree distribution , illuminating the important connection between the two distributions .",
    "the dspl is of great relevance to transport processes on networks such as information flow and epidemic spreading .",
    "for example , an epidemic tends to spread outwards from the node where it was initiated . as time proceeds",
    ", it may reach nodes in shells farther away from the initial node and increases the fraction of infected nodes in the inner shells .",
    "therefore , the number of nodes in each shell and their connectivity affect the rate and efficiency in which the epidemic progresses in the population @xcite .",
    "the approach presented in this paper is aimed at the calculation of the entire distribution of distances between pairs of nodes in configuration model networks . in general",
    ", it does not provide a closed form expression for the dspl but a set of recursion equations which can be evaluated for a given network size and a given degree distribution . as a result , it is difficult to obtain a closed form expression for the mean distance , except for special cases such as the regular graph .",
    "in fact , for the regular graph , our result for the mean distance coincides with the exact result presented in ref . @xcite . regarding the mode of the dspl , we do manage to obtain an analytical expression in the general case .",
    "the mode turns out to be more amenable to analysis than the mean because it can be determined by a local criterion . for degree distributions with a finite second moment , the mean and the mode tend to scale in a similar fashion .",
    "however , in the case of scale free networks , the mean and the mode may scale differently .",
    "this is related to the fact that in scale free networks with @xmath195 , the second moment of the degree distribution , @xmath231 , diverges in the infinite system limit .",
    "the second moment appears in the equations for the mean distance and for the mode , thus calling for a special care in scale free networks .",
    "the mode is less sensitive to extreme values and therefore is expected to be smaller .",
    "we find that for @xmath195 the mode is of order @xmath98 , namely does not scale with the network size . lacking a closed form expression for the mean , we can not provide a conclusive result for the scaling of the mean with the system size .",
