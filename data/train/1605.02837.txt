    "several phenomena have been probed by gate modulated raman spectroscopy in graphene , such as the kohn anomaly ( ka ) effect or the phonon frequency renormalization  @xcite , the quantum interference effect  @xcite , electron - electron interaction  @xcite , and the fano resonance in the raman spectra of graphene  @xcite .",

    "the frequency shift is linearly proportional to @xmath6 .",

    "moreover , since the raman intensity as a function of @xmath0 is not calculated , different dispersion of raman peaks as a function of @xmath0 can not be explained from that theory .    observing the change of raman intensity as a function of @xmath0 reveals the quantum interference effect . when @xmath16 , some raman scattering paths are suppressed due to the pauli exclusion principle . even with the reduced number of scattering paths , the raman intensity surprisingly increases at a particular value of @xmath0 when constructive raman phases among various scattering paths are enhanced .",

    "the calculated raman spectra at @xmath158 and @xmath149 in fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) and ( d ) clearly show that the @xmath10 and @xmath8 bands can not be fit by a single lorentian for each band .",
    "figure  [ fig9](a ) shows the lorentzian fitting results on the second order raman spectra for @xmath153 .",
    "the dotted line is the calculated raman intensity fitted by six lorentzians .",
    "we fit the @xmath8 bands with two lorentzians labelled by @xmath159 ( blue ) and @xmath160 ( red ) which reffer to @xmath8 bands from outer ( @xmath52 in km direction ) and inner ( @xmath52 in @xmath161 direction ) scattering processes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "three lorentzians are needed to fit the @xmath10 band , labelled by @xmath162 ( green ) , @xmath163 ( blue ) , and @xmath164 ( red ) .",
    "finally one lorentzian is used to fit the @xmath20 band .",

    "the calculated results in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b)-(e ) can not fit the experimental value of both the peak position and the linewidth due to the underestimation of the electronic energy dispersion as previously discussed in the @xmath18 dependence of the second - order raman spectra  [ see fig .",
    "[ fig7](d ) ] . but",
    "we can discuss the change of both quantities as a function of @xmath0 , where the ka effect takes place . in figs .",
    "[ fig9](b)-(e ) , both the spectral peak position and the linewidth as a function of @xmath0 are plotted in the same range , comparing the theory and experiments .",
    "reasonable agreements between experiments and theory are achieved .",
    "the three major peaks , i.e. , the @xmath160 , @xmath164 , and @xmath20 bands show `` @xmath165 '' ( `` v '' ) shapes of the raman peak shift ( spectral linewidth ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "these behaviors exist because of the intraband electron - hole excitation renormalization of phonons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . the @xmath163 band in fig .",
    "[ fig9](d ) is relatively dispersionless in @xmath0 because it is located in the shoulder of the @xmath8 band where 2ito @xmath166 exists .",
    "therefore , for these bands , the competition between interband and intraband electron - hole excitations are expected .",
    "the calculated results overestimate the experimental spectral linewidths of all bands , which is related to the choice of @xmath167 in the @xmath26 integration .",
    "we can tackle this issue by reducing the value of @xmath168 by @xmath169 ; however , the computational burden becomes @xmath170 times larger .",
    "in conclusion , we calculated the first- and second - order raman spectra as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the opposite effect of the kohn anomaly that is found experimentally between the first- and the second - order raman spectra occurs because the ka effect on the first - order raman spectra is dominated by the renormalization of phonons by the interband electron - hole excitation , while in the second - order raman spectra , the intraband electron - hole excitation dominates over the ka effect .",
    "we also discussed the quantum interference effect observed in the change of the raman intensity as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "both the first- and the second - order raman spectra exhibit an impact of the quantum interference effect , especially when @xmath171 .",
    "present calculated results found that not only is the resonance condition important , but also the explicit consideration of the electron - phonon matrix elements are essential to determine the @xmath0 dependence of the raman spectral lineshape .",
