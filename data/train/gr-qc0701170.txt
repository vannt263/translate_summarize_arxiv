    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a spaceborne gravitational - wave ( gw ) laser interferometer for the observation of the low - frequency ( @xmath0 0.1 mhz1 hz ) gw sky ( see @xcite and danzmann s contribution in this volume ) .",
    "lisa is an all - sky monitor with the capability of observing a variety of compact - object binary systems , with masses ranging from a fraction to millions of solar masses .",
    "moreover , lisa could discover gws from entirely new classes of sources , such as exotic compact objects and relics from the early universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although much relevant experience has already been gained in the analysis of gw data collected by ground - based detectors , the differences between space - based and ground - based observations present new difficulties and require novel solutions for data analysis .",
    "these differences include the complex lisa response , the confusion noise from galactic and extra - galactic binary populations , and the simultaneous presence of many weak and strong gw signals .",
    "it is important to tackle these new analysis problems early , in order to develop the tools and methods necessary for the maximum science exploitation of such a revolutionary data set .",
    "the lisa international science team ( list ) has embarked on a programme to foster the development and evaluate the technical readiness of data - analysis tools and capabilities for lisa .",
    "this programme goes under the name of mock lisa data challenges ( mldcs ) .",
    "the mldc task force has been charged by the list to formulate challenge problems , develop standard models of the lisa spacecraft and orbits , and of gw sources , provide computing tools ( e.g. , lisa response simulators and source - waveform generators ) , establish criteria for the evaluation of the responses to the challenges , and provide any technical support necessary to the challenge participants .",
    "these challenges are meant to be blind tests , but not really contests ; the greatest scientific benefit stemming from them will come from the quantitative comparison of results , analysis methods and implementations .",
    "the first round of mldcs  @xcite has just been completed .",
    "details on the data sets , techniques developed for the analyses , and results are provided in the companion article in this volume  @xcite , and in the references cited there . in this short paper",
    "we describe the second round of mldcs , which has just been released  @xcite .",
    "the challenge-2 data sets represent a very significant increase in complexity with respect to those distributed for challenge 1 .",
    "more importantly , they contain the full set of key sources that are expected to make up the real lisa data , and therefore provide a realistic testbed for different data - analysis approaches .",
    "since the instrument response , instrument noise , and waveform models adopted so far in the mldcs employ various simplifications , much work will be needed beyond the completion of challenge 2 to fully develop the data - analysis capabilities necessary for the mission , and future rounds of mldcs will address progressively more realistic measurement scenarios and introduce more general gravitational waveforms .",
    "the details of the schedule of mldcs from challenge 3 onwards have not been decided yet , but we expect to release a third round of mldcs in summer 2007 .",
    "the challenge-1 data sets contained single sources , or sets of several ( @xmath1 ) signals well separated in parameter space ; an exception were two data sets containing @xmath2 signals from galactic binaries , concentrated in frequency bands of width 30 @xmath3hz and 3 @xmath3hz .",
    "challenge 1 focused on only two signal classes : galactic stellar - mass binaries and massive  black - hole ( mbh ) binary inspirals .",
    "indeed , the key goal of this first round of challenges was the development and validation of source - specific data - analysis techniques for the sources featured in the lisa mission s minimum science requirements .",
    "challenge 2 has a much more realistic flavour : it includes millions of galactic binaries , as we expect in reality , in addition to multiple massive  black - hole binaries and extreme  mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) .",
    "thus , challenge 2 requires analysts to tackle the _ global analysis _ of many simultaneous and superimposed signals , in the presence of the most complex sources ( emris ) that we expect to observe with lisa .",
    "challenge 2 includes five single - source data sets ( challenge 1.3 ) , dedicated specifically to emris , and two multi - source data sets ( challenge 2.1 and 2.2 ) .",
    "the data sets are all @xmath4 years long : namely , they contain @xmath5 data points sampled at a cadence of 15 s. more specifically , the data sets are as follows :    * _ challenge 1.3 _ consists of five data sets , each containing a gw signal from a single emri with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 ) that yields the highest snr .",
    "] between 40 and 110 ; * _ challenge 2.1 _ contains signals from ( i ) a full population of galactic binary systems ( about 26 million sources ) , including ( ii ) 25 `` verification binaries '' ; * _ challenge 2.2 _ contains signals from ( i ) a full population of galactic binary systems ( about 26 million sources ) , including ( ii ) 25 `` verification binaries '' ; ( iii ) an undisclosed number ( between 4 and 6 ) of mbh binaries with snrs between @xmath8 and @xmath9 and different coalescence times ( not all within the two years of observation ) ; and ( iv ) 5 emris , with snrs between 30 and 100 .",
    "details about the ranges from which the source parameters were drawn randomly are given in table  [ t : mldc2 ] .",
    "figure [ f : c2.2 ] shows a representative challenge-2.2 data set ( not used in the actual challenge ) .",
    "since data sets 2.1 and 2.2 contain signals from millions of galactic binaries , the task force has identified four restricted frequency bands on which analysis should concentrate first , and over which the evaluation of responses will be carried out in much more depth : these windows are 0.2985 mhz @xmath10 0.3015 mhz , 0.9985 mhz @xmath10 1.0015 mhz , 2.9985 mhz @xmath10 3.0015 mhz , and 5.9985 mhz @xmath10 6.0015 mhz .",

    "the training data sets come in two flavors : `` noisy '' and noise - free , the latter containing exactly the same gw signal(s ) as those present in the noisy set .",
    "in addition , to facilitate the development and testing of analysis schemes , training data sets 2.1 and 2.2 will contain the same realization of the galaxy",

    "the task force plans to process the results and provide an initial summary and evaluation of this round within about a month of receiving the results .",
    "we have developed a set of conventions to describe the lisa orbit and response , which constitute the _ pseudo - lisa _ adopted in challenges 1 and 2 .",

    "more complicated paths are required to deal with the real - orbit variations of the armlengths , giving rise to the three tdi `` generations . '' for the initial challenges , we adopt _ tdi 1.5 _ observables @xcite .",

    ", tdi 2.0 would be required to completely cancel laser noise in a flexing lisa array , such as that modelled by the simulators ; however , the increase in complexity between tdi 1.5 and 2.0 complicates the numerical treatment of one - way measurements , but it is negligible for the purpose of the gw response . for the sake of simplicity , challenges 1 and 2 feature data sets of tdi 1.5 observables with no laser noise .",
    "the model of the lisa instrument noise adopted in challenge 2 is identical to that considered for challenge 1 .",
    "it includes contributions from optical noise ( assumed white in phase ) , with one - sided spectral density s_^1/2(f ) = 20 10 ^ -12 ^-1/2 , [ eq : optn ] and from acceleration noise ( assumed white in acceleration , but increasing as @xmath66 below @xmath67 hz ) , with one - sided spectral density s_^1/2(f ) = 3 10 ^ -15 [ 1 + ( 10 ^ -4hz / f)^2]^1/2 ^-2 ^-1/2 .",

    "specifically , synthetic lisa generates independent gaussian deviates ( i.e. , white noise ) in the time domain , and then filters them digitally to obtain the desired spectral shape ; the lisa simulator generates independent gaussian deviates in the frequency domain , multiplies them by @xmath68 , and ffts to the time domain .",
    "in this section we describe the conventions adopted to describe the gravitational waveforms and the assumptions made on the signals to construct the data sets .",
