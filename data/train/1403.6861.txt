    "larger uncertainties of 34% are quoted for the calculated ers fluxes ; but those values are reduced by an analysis of the band - to - band flux ratios , which constrain the sphere temperature .",
    "a minimum error bar arises from the two uncertainties of 2% attributed to @xmath261% in the sphere radii and @xmath261% in the distance to the ejected spheres . if each of the 5 ers ejection events are independent , eg . the 1% radius error is random and not the same for all 5 released spheres , then the error - in - the - mean floor for each band is @xmath27 , which is consistent with the adopted 1.4% in table 3 .",
