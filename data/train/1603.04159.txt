    "matters to be the gravity sources of the black holes form the singularities in the classical theories .",
    "however the quantum gravity effect working among those matters is considered to become stronger as those matters close up to the plank scale , and it is expected that the repulsive force preventing those matters from forming a singularity appears from the quantum gravity effect . as a result",
    "the singularities in the classical black holes can be expected not to present if the quantum gravity effect is taken into account .",
    "those black holes are named _ regular black hole _ or _ non - singular black hole_. currently many stars expected as black holes have been observed , and the regular black holes are considered to be able to correspond to those actual black holes somehow . hence regular black holes would be interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically .    until now the schwarzschild regular black hole and its rotating version have been proposed in refs.@xcite and  @xcite respectively .",
    "the four - dimensional rotating regular black holes with a time - delay  ( a gravitational time dilation )  @xcite has also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the time - delay is an indispensable in the descriptions of any black holes . in classical black holes with singularities , the time - delay naturally appears .",
    "hence we do not need to give attention particularly to the time - delay in classical black holes with singularities .",
    "however in the regular black holes , the time - delay becomes absent for a byproduct in the formalism for the regularization of the singularity , which we explain in appendix.[app : timedelay ] in this paper .",
    "hence we need to give attention to the time - delay in the case of regular black holes .",
    "one of the most important problems in the black hole physics would be the information paradox and the microscopic unveiling of the bekenstein - hawking entropy obtained from the thermodynamic analogy . in those problems",
    "the hawking fluxes play very important role . hence to investigate the hawking fluxes in the regular black holes",
    "would be very interesting .",
    "so far several ways for the computation of the hawking fluxes have been invented  ( @xcite as a review ) , and in 2005 a computation algorithm has newly been invented  @xcite .",
    "it is referred to as _ anomaly cancellation method _ or just _ anomaly cancellation _",
    ", which is an algorithm to determine the hawking fluxes based on a demand that there should be no anomalies in the quantum field theories at the near - horizon region .",
    "the anomaly cancellation method could shed a new light to the microscopic unveiling of the black hole problems . because in the anomaly",
    "cancellation method , a consistency in the microscopic description based on the quantum field theory  ( the invariance under the local transformations at the quantum level ) and hawking fluxes are linked each other .",
    "the algorithm of the anomaly cancellation method is feasible when the field theories can be reduced to an infinite collection of the two - dimensional free massless model at the near - horizon region .",
    "once the field theories are reduced to such an infinite collection of the two - dimensional free model at the near - horizon region , the computation can be performed without any details of the original model .",
    "since many field theories can be reduced to an infinite collection of two - dimensional free massless model at the near - horizon region in various kinds of black holes , the anomaly cancellation method can be considered as applicable in wide range of theories , and we can see that the hawking fluxes are universal phenomena independent of the details of each theory .    hence we in this paper compute the hawking thermal flux and the total flux of energy - momentum tensor from the rotating regular black hole with a time - delay  @xcite based on the anomaly cancellation method  @xcite .",
    "the computation in the case of the regular schwartzshild black holes has already been performed  @xcite . however",
    "the computation involving the rotation and the time - delay has not been performed , and what we compute in this paper is that case .",
    "further , if the black holes are regular black holes , the time - delay should be involved for the reason mentioned above .",
    "so in this study it would be considered that we compute a more realistic hawking fluxes with the three effects :  1 )  the quantum gravity effect regularizing the gravity source of the black holes , 2 )  the rotation of the black hole , and 3 )  the time - delay .",
    "organization of this paper is as follows :   in sec.[chap : rbhtd ] , the metric of rotating regular black hole and three ways to involve the time - delay into it are given .",
    "in sec.[chap : dra ] , taking a general scalar field theory , it is shown that the action of the matter fields can be reduced to an infinite collection of the two - dimensional free model near the horizon in the type ii or iii metrics .",
    "further it is argued that the type i metric in which the dimensional can not be performed would be some problematic metric , and its cause is mentioned . in sec.[the regularization effect ] , the hawking fluxes ( the hawking thermal flux and the total flux of energy - momentum tensor ) are computed based on the anomaly cancellation method .",
    "sec.[summary ] is the summary of this paper . in appendices , the regular black hole with a time - delay we consider in this paper",
    "is briefly reviewed , etc .",
    "we consider the following rotating regular black hole metric ) is obtained  @xcite from the schwarzschild regular black hole  @xcite through the newman - janis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 is the adm mass , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the angular momentum of the black hole , and @xmath8 is the plank length which originates in the quantum gravity effect regularizing the gravity source of the black hole .",
    "it tuns out that @xmath9 is a fifth - order equation .",
    "so we can not get @xmath10 analytically , where @xmath10 are the outer and inner horizon radii .",
    "further , solving @xmath10 numerically is technically hard for the fact that @xmath10 depend on three parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence in this study , expanding @xmath12 in terms of @xmath8 as @xmath13 , and considering @xmath14 , we solve @xmath9 up to its first - order . in that case",
    ", @xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is ignorable now , and @xmath9 is given as a forth - order equation , which we formally write as @xmath18 .",
    "finally the four solutions in @xmath9 up to the first - order expansion of @xmath8 are @xmath19 in @xmath10 , let us note that the first two terms are the typical ones in the classical kerr black holes , and the third term is the corrections coming from the quantum gravity effect .",
    "so it is obvious that @xmath20 are unphysical solutions and @xmath10 are physical solutions .",
    "then , we consider the three rotating regular black holes with a time - delay  @xcite , which can be obtained by the following replacement in the metric of eq.([rrbhtd ] ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 , modifying only the @xmath22 term in the metric .",
    "2 .   @xmath23 , modifying the @xmath22 and @xmath24 terms .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath25 , modifying the @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 terms .",
    "in this paper we refer to these three as the type  i , ii and iii metrics , and    @xmath27    as the factor to involve a time - delay .",
    "@xmath28 is the parameter to control the time - delay , and @xmath29 is some numerical constant associated with the 1-loop correction of the quantum gravity .",
    "@xmath30 corresponds to the situation that the time - delay is small . on the other hand @xmath31 corresponds to the situation that the time - delay is large  ( for the explanation of this , see eq.([ggttalpha ] ) ) .",
    "we plot the @xmath32- , @xmath29- and @xmath5-dependences in the function @xmath33 in fig.[fig_g ] .",
    "since the @xmath29- and the @xmath5-dependences are the same in the expression of @xmath33 , we do not make a plot for the @xmath5-dependence in fig.[fig_g ] .",
    "we can see from fig.[fig_g ] that :    * @xmath33 becomes smaller as @xmath29 or @xmath5 become larger , for a same @xmath34 .",
    "* @xmath33 becomes smaller as @xmath32 becomes smaller , for a same @xmath34 .",

    "now we consider the quantum field theories which will be the ingredient of the hawking fluxes on the background space - times given as the type i , ii and iii metrics . for now , assuming that we have some field theory , let us focus on the scalar field part in the whole action , which we write as @xmath37    we can find that the term @xmath38 is suppressed at the near - horizon region for the fact that @xmath39 vanishes at the horizon .",
    "this suppression can be found by changing the radial coordinate to the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 defined as @xmath41",
    ". hence we disregard @xmath42 at the near - horizon region .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , in the type ii and iii metrics , @xmath54 where @xmath55 in the above computations , for example to reach eq.([kiiaiii ] ) in the type ii metric , we have performed the following computation : @xmath56 where in the above description we have omitted to write the integral and @xmath57 , @xmath58 . from the second to third lines",
    ", we have performed the following computation :  first once rewriting the second term as @xmath59 and then @xmath60 from the forth to fifth lines , from the demand @xmath61 , we have fixed @xmath62 to @xmath63 .    continuing the computation in the type ii or iii metrics , expanding the scalar field by the spherical harmonic oscillator function :  @xmath64 , and using the eigen equation for the angular momentum operator and the inner product : @xmath65 we can find that the models reduce to infinite free massless scalar field theories on the two - dimensional space of @xmath66 as @xmath67 with the effective u(1 ) gauge field and dilaton as @xmath68 where @xmath62 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given in eq.([pq ] ) .    on the other hand , it can be seen that the scalar field in the type i metric can not reduce to the two - dimensional theory at the near - horizon region as can be seen from eq.([ki ] ) .    here",
    "let us consider what the dimensional reduction occurs at the near - horizon region intuitively .",
    "the motions of particles which the field theory represents at the near - horizon region are composed of the longitudinal and transverse directions toward the horizon .",
    "then since the strong attractive gravity force toward the horizon works in the longitudinal direction , the motions in the longitudinal direction would become much larger than the motions in the transverse direction . as a result the motions in the transverse direction become negligible at the near - horizon region .",
    "hence it would be considered that what the dimensional reduction occurs at the near - horizon region would be natural .",
    "( at this time the motions in the longitudinal direction become the ingoing modes only . )",
    "next at the near - horizon region , the motions of particles become mostly a free falling with the speed of light . as a result",
    "the kinetic energy in the particles becomes maximally large .",
    "hence in the motions with a finite mass at the near - horizon region , what the mass term becomes negligible would be natural .",
    "actually the mass term in the model we consider in this study at the near - horizon region is finite , as in eq.([scalar ] ) ) , and modes with mass which becomes comparable with the kinetic term at the near - horizon region are not considered . ] .",
    "lastly , since all the modes uniquely perform mostly a free falling with speed of light as the massless modes at the near - horizon region , it would be considered that the interaction effects among them vanish .",
    "hence what the interaction term vanishes would be natural .",
    "so from the above , it would be considered that what the dimensional reduction occurs is natural , and the type i metric in which the dimensional reduction can not be performed is considered as some problematic metric .",
    "the reason for the feasibility in the dimensional reduction in type ii and iii metrics and the infeasibility in type i metric is as follows :    * in order for the dimensional reduction to occur , we can see that one of the necessary conditions is that the contribution of the angular part in eq.([giiianglep0 ] ) and the term concerning the angle , @xmath71 , in eq.([giiikinp0 ] ) should be canceled each other .",
    "+ this canceling can be possible in the case of the type ii and iii metrics . because @xmath72 and @xmath73 as in eqs.([invmetii ] ) and ( [ invmetiii ] ) . as a result , in eq.([giiianglep0 ] ) the second term of @xmath74 becomes dominant at the near - horizon region where @xmath75 , and can survive , while the first term negligible .",
    "then since @xmath76 can be valid in the case of the type ii and iii metrics , where these @xmath77 and @xmath78 mean the coefficients in eqs.([giiianglep0 ] ) and ( [ giiikinp0 ] ) respectively , the contribution of the angular part in eq.([giiianglep0 ] ) and the term concerning @xmath79 in eq.([giiikinp0 ] ) can be canceled each other in the case of the type ii and iii metrics .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the case of the type i metric , @xmath80 and @xmath81 in terms of the order of @xmath15 as in eq.([invmeti ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the two terms in eq.([giiianglep0 ] ) become comparative each other at the near - horizon region , and can survive at the near - horizon region .",
    "however in the case of the type i metric , these two terms can not be canceled by the term concerning @xmath79 in eq.([giiikinp0 ] ) . *",
    "another one reason which makes the dimensional reduction feasible in the type ii and iii metrics is that the invariant volume @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath82 in the case of the type ii and iii metrics as in eq.([sqrtmg ] ) . as a result",
    "the integral meaning the inner product of @xmath83 in eq.([formulaey ] ) can become feasible in the computation in the case of the type ii and iii metrics .",
    "+ in contrast , from this we can see that the dimensional reduction is infeasible in the case of the type i metric , since the invariant volume is proportional to @xmath84 as in eq.([sqrtmg ] ) in the case of the type i metric .    from this result",
    ", we can suppose that if the background space - time is the type ii or iii metric , the whole field theory action considered in the beginning of this section can also get the dimensional reduction to an infinite two - dimensional free massless action like eq.([2dra ] ) near the horizon .",
    "since the dimensional reduction like eq.([2dra ] ) is indispensable in the anomaly cancellation method , we in this paper consider the type ii and iii metrics in the computation for the hawking fluxes performed in what follows .    here",
    "let us note that we do not need to specify the model of the field theory  ( e.g. how mass and interaction terms are etc ) . because we in this paper consider the situation after the models have reduced to the two dimensional theory . even if whatever the models before the dimensional reduction are .",
    "now that the expressions near the horizon have been obtained as in eq.([2dra ] ) , let us here give the surface gravities in the type ii and iii metrics as @xmath85 we can see that this is consistent with the one in ref.@xcite when @xmath86  ( no rotating case ) and @xmath87  ( no time - delay case ) .",
    "further for the convenience in the actual computation , we also give the components of the christoffel in the background in eq.([2dra ] ) as @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "we in this section compute the u(1 ) gauge current and the energy - momentum tensor in general quantum field theories having reduced to infinite two - dimensional free massless models at the near horizon region in the type ii and iii metrics based on the anomaly cancellation method .",
    "then we finally obtain the hawking thermal flux and the total flux of energy - momentum tensor from the rotating regular black hole with a time - delay .",
    "our computation is carried out in the same fashion with refs.@xcite basically . however in our analysis , @xmath90 and @xmath91 appear in eqs.([region_h ] ) and ( [ region_o ] ) .",
    "those parameters do not appear in refs.@xcite and any other related papers . in using @xmath90 and @xmath91 ,",
    "the meaning of computation does not change .",
    "we use those just to give attention to the applicable limit for what both ingoing and outgoing modes present or only ingoing modes present at the near - horizon region and what the theories can be regarded as an infinite two - dimensional free massless model or not . for more detail , see the explanation under eqs.([region_h ] ) and ( [ region_o ] ) .",
    "what follows are common to the type ii and iii metrics .",
    "so in what follows , we do not specify which computation and result correspond to which type of metrics .",
    "first we set up the radial direction .",
    "it is known that on the horizon the outgoing modes do not present and there is the ingoing modes only .",
    "then as a setting , corresponding to such a situation we divide the radial direction in the exterior of the horizon into two regions using a parameter @xmath90 as @xmath92 corresponding to this , @xmath90 is very small , @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 stands for the maximum @xmath32 in which the quantum field theories can be uniquely assumed to be the two - dimensional model .",
    "namely we assume that the dimensional reduction in sec.[chap : dra ] is possible for @xmath95 .",
    "we refer to the two regions in eqs.([region_h ] ) and ( [ region_o ] ) as the regions @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . here , the left- and right - handed modes in the two - dimensional field theories correspond to the outgoing and ingoing modes respectively .",
    "although now we have divided the radial direction using @xmath90 sharply , the conserved currents are also represented sharply using the step functions as in eqs.([tcu ] ) and ( [ tmu ] ) .",
    "this representation is a typical one in the analysis of the anomaly cancellation method  @xcite .",
    "of course the representation using the step function is not the one naturally derived , but an artificial proposal .",
    "it should be a smooth function in nature .",
    "there are some attempts not using the step function  @xcite  ( this problem is also touched on in chapter.4 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however in that case other unnatural stuffs arise .      corresponding to the regions @xmath97 and @xmath96 , we write the u(1 ) gauge current as @xmath98 where @xmath89 , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath101 is a step function .",
    "thus @xmath102 and @xmath103 stand for the u(1 ) gauge current in the regions @xmath97 and @xmath96 , respectively . since our background space - time is independent of the time as in eq.([2dra ] ) , we let the u(1 ) gauge current have the @xmath32-dependence only :  @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    in the region @xmath97 , the u(1 ) gauge current is conserved as @xmath106 on the other hand , in the region @xmath96 , let us consider the contribution of the left- or right - handed modes distinctively in the conservation equation of the u(1 ) gauge current .",
    "then as the anomalous equation for the chiral transformation in the two - dimensional theories , it can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 , and @xmath109 respectively correspond to the chiral situation where there is only left-/right - handed modes , respectively .",
    "since only the left - handed modes present in the region @xmath96 , we consider the case of the plus sign in eq.([conservation low at h ] ) .",
    "further we can find that @xmath110 in the background in eq.([2dra ] ) .",
    "of eq.([conservation low at h ] ) becomes @xmath111 .",
    "in addition from this , since it ends up in this study that there is no equation to determine the value of @xmath112 , it is possible in this study to assume @xmath113 .    here if we compute the two - dimensional chiral anomaly  @xcite , we can find that eq.([conservation low at h ] ) is given by @xmath114 .",
    "( this is because , briefly saying , in the case of @xmath115 , in the expansion at eq.(4.60 ) in ref.@xcite the first - order term survives instead of the second - order term . as a result the power of @xmath116 in eq.(4.61 ) in ref.@xcite changes to @xmath117 , where this @xmath116 corresponds to the @xmath118 in this study . )",
    "hence there is apparently a discrepancy in the power of @xmath118 .",
    "however our @xmath119 gauge current @xmath103 could be considered to be defined as @xmath120 . here",
    "the usual one is @xmath121 .",
    "the former and latter ones are interpreted as the electric charge density current and the probability density current , respectively .",
    "backing to eq.([conservation low at h ] ) , hence we can write the u(1 ) gauge currents in the regions @xmath122 and @xmath123 as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the integral constants that respectively stand for the values of the u(1 ) gauge currents at @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 in the type ii and iii metrics are given in eq.([metricstype ] ) .",
    "the @xmath32 in the upper bound of the integration is taken less than @xmath130 .",
    "here we do not need to consider the @xmath131-component of the current @xmath132 . because we can show @xmath133 . as a result , @xmath132 is irrelevant in the computation of eq.([dwu ] ) .",
    "now let us consider the effective action @xmath134 given by the two - dimensional model at the near horizon region , in which all the modes in the interior of the horizon and the outside of @xmath130 have been integrated out .",
    "then , the variation of @xmath134 under the u(1 ) gauge transformation can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the u(1 ) gauge transformation parameter , the integration range of @xmath32 is @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is given in eqs.([ttrs1 ] ) and ( [ ttrs2 ] ) .",
    "the above computation leads the anomalous situation if r.h.s .",
    "in eq.([dwu ] ) does not vanish",
    ". the theory should be anomaly - free even near the horizon , and @xmath139 must be zero . here because of the quantum tunneling process , indeed there is the contribution of the the right - handed modes even near the horizon at the quantum level , which cancels the second term in r.h.s .. as a result the first term remains in r.h.s .. the first term should also vanish for the anomaly - free , which can be realized by the following constraint : @xmath140 by this we can consider that now @xmath139 becomes zero and the situation becomes anomaly - free .",
    "we now fix @xmath126 by the boundary condition that the covariant current  @xcite : @xmath141 vanishes at the horizon :  @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively correspond to the left- and right - handed modes , and whose conservation equation is @xmath145 . as a result @xmath126 can be fixed as @xmath146 .    here",
    "there might be a question that , not considering @xmath147 only when we impose the boundary condition , but why all the computation had not performed using the covariant current from the beginning . indeed",
    "if one considers @xmath147 , since the conserved equation can be written in the covariant form , if we had performed our analysis with @xmath147 in eq.([covariant current ] ) ( and eq.([covaanomaly1 ] ) ) , our computation would have been covariant .",
    "of course what the covariant current is used only when the boundary condition is considered is a problem .",
    "but basically this is a typical procedure in the anomaly cancellation method  @xcite  ( this problem is also touched on in chapter.4 in ref.@xcite ) as well as a problem in the representation using step functions in eq.([tcu ] ) ( and ( [ tmu ] ) )  ( also see the last paragraph in sec.[subsec : drd ] ) .",
    "actually there is a study performing only with the covariant current  @xcite .",
    "however in that case there arises other unnatural stuffs .    then substituting the @xmath126 obtained above into @xmath148 in eq.([accj ] )",
    ", we can obtain @xmath148 as @xmath149 where @xmath69 for the type ii and iii metrics are given in eq.([pq ] ) . since @xmath150 in the type iii metric , @xmath148 in the type iii metric has no dependence on the time - delay .",
    "let us notice that @xmath118 appearing in the above expression is not mass but an index in the partial wave expansion in the above of eq.([2dra ] ) .    from the same discussion in the appendix.a in ref.@xcite , we can see that the above @xmath148 can be identified with the hawking thermal flux from the regular rotating black hole with a time - delay . to show this identification we repeat the virtually same description with ref.@xcite in what follows .    in general the thermal fluxes from the rotating black holes can be computed as @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the distribution function of fermions in the rotating black holes with a time - delay : @xmath153 we can see that the result in eq.([28 ] ) is consistent with our result in eq.([c0_am_result ] ) .",
    "our result involves the three effects :    * @xmath33  ( the time - delay ) * @xmath11  ( the angular momentum of the black hole ) * @xmath154  ( the quantum gravity effect regularizing our black hole singularity via @xmath155 as in eq.([rpm ] ) )    we can see that when there is no time - delay  ( @xmath87 ) and no quantum gravity effect  ( @xmath156 ) , our result in eq.([c0_am_result ] ) can agree with the hawking thermal flux from the classical kerr black hole given in eq.(25 ) in ref.@xcite .",

    "then since @xmath169 should be invariant under the general coordinate transformation , we can write the following ward identity : @xmath170 z = 0 .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the energy - momentum tensor @xmath171 and current @xmath172 , from eq.([coordid ] ) we can obtain the following identity : @xmath173 in the above , the last term is the consistent anomaly , and @xmath109 is adopted when there is only the left  ( outgoing)/right  ( ingoing ) -handed modes , respectively .",
    "the second term is also an anomalous term when the situation is chiral , and its value is given in eq.([conservation low at h ] ) .",
    "the first and third terms arise due to the fact that our background gauge and dilaton fields are classical as in eq.([metricstype ] ) . here",
    "we ignore the term @xmath174 in what follows .",
    "we state on this below .    in ref.@xcite and other related papers ,",
    "the term @xmath174 appears when the ward identity is computed as in eq.([anomaly2 ] ) .",
    "but the actual computation in the anomaly cancellation method is performed without the term @xmath174 .",
    "its reason is stated in ref.@xcite as `` since we are considering a static background , the contribution from the dilaton background can be dropped '' .",
    "but it is difficult for me to understand the validity in ignoring the term @xmath174 from this statement . in other related papers",
    "the computation is performed in the same fashion but its reason is also not stated clearly as far as i checked .",
    "however it seems that the dilaton @xmath164 can be absorbed into @xmath168 by rescaling @xmath168 in eq.([2dra ] ) .",
    "then since @xmath168 is the fields to get the path - integral , we could forget dilaton @xmath164 .",
    "therefore we could ignore the term @xmath174 in our computation .    now as well as eq.([tcu ] ) , we write the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath175 then , in the region @xmath97 , the identity of eq.([anomaly2 ] ) leads to @xmath176 hence , @xmath177 where we have used eq.([ttrs1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath178 stands for the value of @xmath179 at @xmath127 . here , for the reason written below eq.([grav anomaly eq in h1 ] ) , we do not consider the components in @xmath180 other than @xmath181 .    on the other hand , in the region @xmath96 , as well as the previous section , only left - handed modes present .",
    "then the identity of eq.([anomaly2 ] ) leads to @xmath182 we can find that @xmath183 , where one of stuffs having been used in obtaining this is @xmath184 which is mentioned under eq.([conservation low at h ] ) . hence let us turn to the case that @xmath185 . in this case , we can find that @xmath186 .",
    "so from eq.([grav anomaly eq in h1 ] ) , @xmath187 where @xmath188 @xmath189 is defined in eq.([surfaceg ] ) and @xmath190 means @xmath191 . from the above , @xmath192 where @xmath193 stands for the value of @xmath179 at @xmath194 .",
    "now we fix @xmath193 . to this purpose , we consider eq.([anomaly2 ] ) given by not the consistent energy - momentum tensor but the covariant energy - momentum tensor  @xcite .",
    "namely , we consider @xmath195 then in the region @xmath123 , for the chiral situation that there are only the left - handed modes , the identity of eq.([cga eq in h1 ] ) leads to @xmath196 for the case that @xmath185 , the above can be written as @xmath197 where @xmath198",
    ". then we can find a relation , we can find a general relation :  @xmath199 . ] : @xmath200 imposing the boundary condition @xmath201 , from eq.([consiscovaanomaly ] ) we can obtain the following result : @xmath202 where we have used  @xmath203 , which can be seen from eq.([consgravanomaly ] ) , @xmath29 means the inverse temperature given in eq.([surfaceg ] ) .",
    "now considering the effective action @xmath134 given by the two - dimensional model , let us consider its variation under the general coordinate transformation , which can be written as @xmath204 where the above is the expression obtained without the contribution of the right - handed modes as well as eq.([dwu ] ) . in the r.h.s .",
    "of the third line , although the first term is breaking the invariance , it can be tolerated for the fact that our background gauge field is classical , as in eq.([2dra ] )  @xcite .",
    "the second and third terms are anomalous , which should vanish , since the original theory is anomaly - free .    then from the demand that the third term should vanish for the anomaly - free , the following constraint is led : @xmath205 using @xmath193 in eq.([a_h ] )",
    ", we can obtain the following @xmath178 : @xmath206 where @xmath62 and @xmath69 for the type ii and iii metrics are given in eq.([pq ] ) . since @xmath150 in the type iii metric , @xmath178 in the type iii metric has no dependence on the time - delay . here",
    "let us notice that @xmath118 appearing in the above expression is not mass but an index in the partial wave expansion in the above of eq.([2dra ] ) .    from the same discussion in the appendix.a of ref.@xcite , we can see that the above @xmath178 can be identified with the total flux of energy - momentum tensor from the regular rotating black hole with a time - delay . to show this identification we repeat the virtually same description in ref.@xcite in what follows .    in general the total fluxes of the energy - momentum tensor can be computed from the rotating black holes as @xmath207 where the distribution function of fermions @xmath152 in the rotating black holes with the time - delay is given in eq.([distfuncfer ] ) .",
    "we can see that eq.([47 ] ) is consistent with our result in eq.([a0_em_result ] ) .    as well as eq.([c0_am_result ] ) , our result involves the three effects :     * @xmath33  ( the time - delay ) * @xmath11  ( the angular momentum of the black hole ) * @xmath154  ( the quantum gravity effect regularizing our black hole singularity via @xmath155 as in eq.([rpm ] ) )    we can see that when there is no time - delay  ( @xmath87 ) and no quantum gravity effect  ( @xmath156 ) , our result in eq.([a0_em_result ] ) can agree with the total flux of energy - momentum tensor from the classical kerr black hole given in eq.(36 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition if @xmath86 and @xmath87 with leaving @xmath154 , our result can agree with the hawking thermal flux of schwartzshild regular black hole given in eq.(4.7 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32- , @xmath29- and @xmath5-dependences in @xmath178 via @xmath33 can be known from fig.[fig_g ] . in what follows",
    ", the same comment with the last paragraph in sec.[subsec : the angular momentum ] will be followed .",
    "we skip to describe it here again .",
    "in this paper the hawking fluxes from the rotating regular black holes with a time - delay described by the type ii and iii metrics has been computed based on the anomaly cancellation method .    as for the type i metric",
    ", it has been turned out that field theories can not be reduced to infinite two - dimensional free massless theories in which the anomaly cancellation method is feasible at the near - horizon region . since occurring of the dimensional reduction would be natural as we have mentioned under eq.([metricstype ] ) , it could be considered that the type i metric would be some problematic metric .",
    "the cause for the feasibility of the dimensional reduction in the type ii and iii metrics and the infeasibility in the type i metric has been mentioned in sec.[chap : dra ] .",
    "the hawking fluxes we have computed in this paper involve three effects as in eqs.([c0_am_result ] ) and ( [ a0_em_result ] ) :    * @xmath33  ( the time - delay ) * @xmath11  ( the angular momentum of the black hole ) * @xmath154  ( the quantum gravity effect regularizing our black hole singularity via @xmath155 as in eq.([rpm ] ) )    by the effects of @xmath33 and @xmath154 , our result could be considered to correspond to a more realistic hawking fluxes",
    ".    what the hawking fluxes can be obtained based on the anomaly cancellation method would be interesting in terms of the relation between a consistency of quantum field theories and black hole thermodynamics . leaving the hawking fluxes ,",
    "the anomaly cancellation method itself could shed new lights in resolving various problems and elucidating new aspects in the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "further , from the computation of the hawking fluxes based on the anomaly cancellation method , we can see the fact that apart from the black holes , quantum tunneling processes could link to quantum anomalies .",
    "of course in the actual analysis there would be several problems as whether the system is the two dimensional or not , and the model can reduce to an infinite free massless model like this study .",
    "however , what there is some relation between quantum tunneling processes and quantum anomalies would be interesting",
    ". we might be able to get some new insight by reconsidering some quantum tunneling processes in terms of quantum anomalies .",
    "the author thanks hiroshi umetsu , lunchakorn tannukij , rakpong saikaew , simone speziale , sujiphat janaun and tommaso de lorenzo for helpful advise and discussion .",
    "the author also thank the institute for fundamental study and naresuan university .",
    "let us first write a four - dimensional non - rotating and no charged spherical black hole metric as @xmath208 where @xmath209 . if it comes to the schwarzschild black hole , @xmath210 , where @xmath5 is the adm mass .",
    "however , if we attempt to get the schwarzschild regular black hole , we require the metric to behave as the de sitter - like in the central region around @xmath211  ( @xmath8 is some plank length order number with the dimension of the length ) without changing the asymptotic behavior from the schwarzschild black hole . to put it concretely",
    ", we require the following behaviors : @xmath212    here let us give an explanation about the above .",
    "the quantum effect of the gravity becomes stronger in the gravity sources of the black holes when these close up to the plank length order number each other , namely @xmath213 , where @xmath214 stands for the extent of the distribution of the gravity sources .",
    "the effect of the quantum gravity would work as the repulsive force .",
    "hence , it is considered that the gravity sources are prevented from further closing up shorter than the plank order length , and the singularities eventually do not appear .",
    "one way to realize such a situation is to consider that the space - time becomes de sitter - like in the region around @xmath211 by considering the repulsive forces as the tendency of the de sitter spaces to extend .",
    "hence the situation is that the quantum gravity is working as some positive cosmological constant .",
    "actually , the second line in eq.([asyregbh ] ) is a solution of the einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant :  @xmath215 , and is the metric of the de sitter space in the so - called static coordinate , in which there is no singularity in eq.([asyregbh ] ) for @xmath216 without changing the asymptotic behavior from the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "then as a simple one satisfying eq.([asyregbh ] ) , the following @xmath217 has been proposed  @xcite , @xmath218 for the above @xmath217 , we can see that the killing horizons can appear when @xmath219 . hence the schwarzschild regular black holes could be considered by the above metric with @xmath220 .",
    "now we change the notation in eq.([fregbhgtt1 ] ) to the one in ref.@xcite as @xmath221 in this changing , only @xmath5 in the denominator of eq.([fregbhgtt1 ] ) is changed to @xmath222 and @xmath223 is also changed to @xmath224 .",
    "but the properties to be required as the metric in the regular black holes are not changed .    applying the newman - janis algorithm  @xcite to this regular schwarzschild black hole metric , a rotating regular",
    "black hole metric has been obtained  @xcite .",
    "however , at that time some problems appear , which we state in what follows . the rotating regular black hole metric we consider in this paper is the one in which such problems are cured .",
    "first , the asymptotic behavior of the newton potential in the schwarzschild regular black hole space - time with the @xmath217 in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) can be written as @xmath225 where @xmath226 with the @xmath217 given in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the schwarzshild and kerr black hole metrics without the regularization , the newton potentials around the asymptotic region with the 1-loop correction of the quantum gravity are given as  @xcite @xmath227 where @xmath228 is some factor of order @xmath117 associated with the 1-loop correction of the quantum gravity .",
    "hence we can find that @xmath229 term lacks in the newton potential of the regular black hole in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) .    here",
    "we can find that there is no classical contribution given by @xmath230 term in both eqs.([fregp ] ) and ( [ fregnewp ] ) .",
    "as for this , we should note that ref.@xcite is taking the harmonic gauge .",
    "if the harmonic gauge is not taken , the @xmath230 term does not appear .",
    "hence indeed the result written in eq.([fregnewp ] ) is the one in ref.@xcite without the harmonic gauge .",
    "so this is why the numerical factor in eq.([fregnewp ] ) is not written specifically no more than being represented as @xmath228 . because in ref.@xcite , it is given as @xmath231 .",
    "but it is a result computed in the harmonic gauge , and the results we are considering now is the ones without the harmonic gauge .",
    "hence since it is expected that the coefficient is changed now , we represent it just as @xmath228 .",
    "the lacking of @xmath229 term is a problem in the schwarzschild regular black hole metric in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) , and there is the same problem in the rotating regular black hole metric obtained from the schwarzschild regular black hole via the newman - janis algorithm .",
    "in addition to the problem of the lacking of @xmath229 term , there is another problem , which is the lack of the time - delay .",
    "we explain it in the next appendix .",
    "these two problems have been firstly pointed out in ref.@xcite . in the next appendix",
    ", we show the schwarzschild regular black hole metric in which these two problems are cured .",
    "we have pointed out the two problems in the preceding appendix , which are the lacks of the @xmath229 term and the time - delay in the schwarzschild regular black hole metric with @xmath217 in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) . in this appendix",
    "we give the rotating regular black hole in which these two problems are cured according to ref.@xcite .",
    "regarding what s the time - delay , a clock in the center of a cloud of dust shows a time shorter than that of a clock put at infinity for the gravitational effect of the black hole geometry . this is",
    "the time - delay , which should always present and is indispensable if it is a black hole geometry  @xcite . to put it concretely , writing the times counted in the clocks put in the asymptotic region and the center of the regular black holes as @xmath232 and @xmath233 respectively",
    ", the time - delay can be written as @xmath234 where the time - delay gets smaller / larger , when r.h.s .",
    "closes to zero / one , respectively .",
    "then we can find that there is no time - delay in the regular black holes with @xmath217 in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) .",
    "this is because the geometries at the center of the regular black holes are flat as can be seen from eq.([asyregbh ] ) , and this is the problem of the lack of the time - delay in the regular black holes . in order to improve this situation , a replacement :  @xmath235 at the stage of the schwarzschild regular black holes has firstly been proposed  @xcite , where @xmath217 is the one in eq.([fregbhgtt2 ] ) and @xmath236 . here",
    "we should note that this @xmath33 is not the @xmath33 we finally use in this paper .    by this",
    ", we can retrieve the time - delay in the regular schwrtzshild black hole .",
    "furthermore , by this we can find that the another problem , the lack of the @xmath229 term , could also be cured .",
    "hence now it looks that the two problems can be cured .",
    "however it turns out that the curvature diverges in the rotating regular black hole metric obtained from this improved schwarzschild regular black hole metric via the newman - janis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , in ref.@xcite , another version of @xmath33 given in eq.([gtd ] ) has been newly proposed with the procedure above eq.([gtd ] ) .",
    "we now show the behavior of @xmath237 obtained from the procedure above eq.([gtd ] ) in the neighborhood of @xmath238 as @xmath239 where now @xmath33 and @xmath217 in the above are the ones in eqs.([gtd ] ) and ( [ rrbhtd ] ) , respectively . considering the above @xmath237 as a @xmath240 in eq.([timedifference ] )",
    ", we can see that the time - delay could be involved in the rotating regular black hole without the divergence of the curvature  @xcite . here",
    "the time - delay gets larger / smaller for smaller / larger @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "further we can see that the @xmath229 term suggested in the 1-loop quantum gravity  @xcite can appear in the newton potential computed from this @xmath237 as @xmath241    hence now we can consider that the rotating regular black hole with a time - delay in which the two problems  ( the lacks of the @xmath229 term in the 1-loop newton potential and the time - delay without the divergence of the curvature ) are cured can be safely obtained by the procedures written above above eq.([gtd ] ) .",
    "in this appendix , we roughly show how the first lines in eqs.([dwu ] ) and ( [ dwg ] ) can be derived .      first taking some fields @xmath242 ,",
    "let s consider its global transformation , @xmath243 where @xmath90 is some infinitesimal constant .",
    "then we consider the variation of the action under this transformation as @xmath244 at this time if the integrand above can be written as a total derivative as        then under the situation that such a global transformation can hold with some function @xmath246 , let us consider a local transformation depending on a infinitesimal transformation parameter @xmath247 .",
    "then the variation of the action can be written as @xmath248 @xmath249 is the conserved current , and we can see that this is the same form with the first line in eq.([dwu ] ) .",
    "now let us consider an action written as @xmath250 , where @xmath251 and @xmath252 mean some matter fields and metrics .",
    "then let us consider the general coordinate transformation , @xmath253 we write the transformation of fields under this general coordinate transformation as @xmath254 then under the transformation in eq.([diiffeocordtrans ] ) , the variation of the action can be written as @xmath255 where @xmath256 the theory should be invariant under the general coordinate transformation in eq.([diiffeocordtrans ] ) .",
    "so we demand @xmath257 . here",
    "@xmath258 should vanish for a normal assumption that @xmath259 satisfies the equations of motion",
    ". therefore eq.([deltas ] ) becomes @xmath260    @xmath261 can be generally written as @xmath262 where from the first line to the second line a partial derivative has been performed with @xmath263 , and in the last line @xmath264 means the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "now @xmath265 .",
    "then @xmath266 since the first term above can be rewritten into @xmath267 , the contribution from the first term becomes zero .",
    "therefore finally @xmath268 this is the same form with the first line in eq.([dwg ] ) .",
