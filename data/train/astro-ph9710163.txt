    "oxygen is the most abundant element in the galaxy after hydrogen and helium .",
    "consequently , it is important to establish the current - epoch o abundance accurately for studies of galactic chemical evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "a considerable effort has recently gone into determining the abundances of oxygen and other elements in nearby b stars since these young stars should most closely reflect the current ism abundance pattern ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies yield a median b - star oxygen abundance ( per 10@xmath9 h atoms ) of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 450 which is about 2/3 of the grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) solar value ( 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 741 @xmath11 130 ) .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the traditional assumptions that the solar abundance reflects that of the ism at the time of the sun s formation 4.6 gyr ago and that the interstellar o abundance should increase slowly over time ( @xcite , timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "a simple interpretation of the conflict between the solar and b star abundances is that it is a manifestation of the abundance scatter in their respective stellar populations .",
    "for example , cunha & lambert ( 1994 ) find a spread of @xmath110.2 dex among the oxygen abundances in their sample of orion association b stars .",
    "also , in a sample of f and g stars of similar age and galactocentric radius to the sun , @xcite find an iron abundance spread of @xmath110.25 dex with the sun among the most metal - rich cases .",
    "such scatter in the stellar abundances is strongly suggestive of localized abundance inhomogeneities in the ism .",
    "yet , as discussed by @xcite , a variety of hydrodynamical processes operating in the galactic disk should keep the gas chemically well - mixed on short time scales . in order to determine the homogeneity of the local interstellar medium at a level capable of distinguishing between a solar and a b star oxygen abundance",
    ", it is necessary to obtain very sensitive observations .",
    "since o i ( 13.618 ev ) and h i ( 13.598 ev ) have nearly the same ionization potentials , o i is the dominant form of gaseous oxygen in diffuse interstellar h i clouds . although the prominent o i @xmath01302 absorption line is typically saturated in diffuse sightlines , the very weak intersystem transition at 1355.598 can yield accurate gas - phase o abundances if measured with sufficient sensitivity .",
    "observations of this line with the _ copernicus _ satellite indicate a mean interstellar gas - phase oxygen abundance that is 40% to 70% of the solar value ( @xcite )",
    ". however , the scatter in these data is too great to rule out a solar abundance of interstellar oxygen especially since some of the o is tied up in dust grains .",
    "this scatter is primarily due to the uncertainties associated with measuring the weak o i @xmath01356 line strengths .    the ability of the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to obtain uv spectra with higher resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios than those acquired with _",

    "s / n ghrs observations of the o i @xmath01356 absorption in the low density sightlines toward the stars @xmath7 ori and @xmath8 ori , @xcite have found a total oxygen abundance ( gas plus grains ) in orion that is consistent with the stellar ( @xcite ) and nebular determinations ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we present new o i @xmath01356 data ; our total ghrs sample includes 13 sightlines toward stars in seven distinctly different galactic directions at distances ranging from 130 to 1500 pc , with most closer than 500 pc .",
    "these sightlines were particularly chosen for their wide range in physical conditions so as to search for evidence of density - dependent depletion variations in the gas - phase oxygen abundance as well as spatial variations .",
    "the ghrs observations of the interstellar o i @xmath01356 absorption line toward the stars @xmath1 cas , @xmath2 per , @xmath3 ori , @xmath2 ori , 15 mon , @xmath4 cma , and @xmath1 ara were obtained in 1995 october and november using the echelle - a grating and the 20 large science aperture . the detailed characteristics and in - flight performance of the ghrs instrument are discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observations of each star consisted of multiple fp - split exposures centered near 1356  .",
    "an fp - split breaks up an exposure into four subexposures taken at slightly different grating positions so as to better characterize and minimize the impact of the ghrs digicon detector s fixed pattern noise on the s / n ratio of the data .",
    "each of these subexposures was sampled two or four times per digicon diode ( depending on the brightness of the star ) at a velocity resolution of 3.5 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the data reduction procedure discussed in detail by @xcite was utilized to maximize the s / n ratio of the o i spectra .",
    "basically , this process involves four steps : ( 1 ) the subexposures comprising each fp - split exposure are merged in diode space so as to create a template of the fixed pattern noise spectrum , ( 2 ) each subexposure is divided by this noise template , ( 3 ) all of the rectified subexposures are aligned in wavelength space using the interstellar lines as a guide , and ( 4 ) the aligned subexposures are summed to produce the net o i spectrum of each star . as illustrated in figure 1 for five of the stars in our echelle sample , the resulting continuum - flattened spectra reveal convincing detections of the interstellar o i @xmath01356 line in all seven sightlines .",
    "the measured s / n ratios of these spectra are all in the 400 to 600 range .",
    "the ghrs spectra of @xmath0 ori and @xmath5 per displayed in figure 1 were obtained in 1994 february using the g160 m grating and the 025 small science aperture .",
    "these spectra were reduced in the same manner as the echelle data and are each characterized by a velocity resolution of 16 km s@xmath13 and a s / n ratio of about 500 .",
    "the measured equivalent widths of the interstellar o i @xmath01356 absorption in these spectra as well as those in the echelle sightlines are listed in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainties in these line strengths reflect the statistical and continuum placement errors summed in quadrature .",

    "1994 ) , @xmath6 per ( @xcite ) , and @xmath5 oph ( @xcite ) .",
    "the o i column densities listed in table 1 were calculated from the @xmath01356 equivalent widths using the zeippen , seaton , & morton ( 1977 ) oscillator strength of @xmath14 . although the quoted uncertainty in this @xmath15-value is 15% , @xcite have empirically verified that it is consistent with the better - determined @xmath15-value appropriate for the o i @xmath01302 transition . in the cases of @xmath1 cas ,",

    "was applied using a gaussian curve - of - growth with respective @xmath17-values of 2.0@xmath18 , 5.0@xmath19 , and 3.0@xmath20 km s@xmath13 .",
    "these @xmath17-values were estimated from ghrs observations of the interstellar mg ii @xmath211239.9,1240.4 doublet toward @xmath5 per , the mg ii and n i @xmath211160,1161 ( @xcite ) doublets toward @xmath0 ori , and the o i @xmath01356 line width toward @xmath1 ara .",
    "the resultant o i column densities for @xmath5 per , @xmath0 ori , and @xmath1 ara are 24% , 4% , and 6% greater than their weak line limits , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16(o i ) values corresponding to the slightly saturated @xmath01356 lines toward @xmath6 per and @xmath5 oph were taken from the detailed analyses of these sightlines by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and savage et al .",
    "the uncertainties in the o i column densities listed in table 1 reflect the estimated errors in the @xmath01356 equivalent width measurements and the saturation corrections ( where applied ) .",
    "these errors do not include the uncertainty in the @xmath01356 @xmath15-value because it would affect all of the column densities in the same way .",
    "in order to put the ghrs oxygen results in perspective , it is instructive to compare and analyze them in concert with the best _ copernicus _ satellite observations of the interstellar o i @xmath01356 line .",
    "table 2 lists the 14 sightlines toward which the equivalent width of this line has been measured at the 4@xmath22 level or better with _ copernicus _",
    "( @xcite , zeippen et al .  1977 ) .",
    "among the four sightlines in common between the ghrs and _ copernicus _ samples , @xmath5 oph yields similar o i line strengths while the @xmath2 per , @xmath0 ori , and @xmath8 ori lines are weaker in the more sensitive ghrs spectra . in deriving the _ copernicus _",
    "o i column densities listed in table 2 , @xmath2 per and @xmath8 ori were assumed to be optically thin while the @xmath0 ori and @xmath5 oph lines were corrected for saturation in the same way as the ghrs data . since the other sightlines in the _ copernicus _ sample have appreciably stronger o i lines , saturation is more of a concern than in the general case of the ghrs sample .",
    "for these sightlines , saturation corrections were applied using a single - component gaussian curve - of - growth and the @xmath17-value estimates listed in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath17-value estimates are based in part on _ copernicus _ observations of interstellar cl i and p ii in these sightlines ( @xcite ) .",
    "the impact of the saturation corrections on @xmath16(o i ) ranges from 12% over the weak - line limit for @xmath3 sco to 68% for @xmath23 oph , and less than 30% for most of the other sightlines .",
    "the quoted errors in the derived o i column densities reflect the uncertainities in these corrections as well as those in the @xmath01356 line strength measurements .    the total hydrogen column densities ( @xmath16(h )",
    "@xmath10 2@xmath16(h@xmath24 ) @xmath25 @xmath16(h i ) ) listed in tables 1 and 2 were determined in the same manner for each sightline in the ghrs and _ copernicus _ samples .",
    "these values reflect the h@xmath24 column densities measured by savage et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and the weighted means of the bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ) and diplas & savage ( 1994 ) @xmath16(h i ) data .",
    "the uncertainties in the resulting oxygen abundances ( per 10@xmath9 h atoms ) in tables 1 and 2 reflect the propagated errors in both @xmath16(o i ) and @xmath16(h )",
    ". taken together , the ghrs sightlines yield a weighted mean interstellar gas - phase oxygen abundance of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 319 @xmath11 14 while the _ copernicus _ data yields 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 361 @xmath11 20 .",
    "although the _ copernicus _ mean is heavily weighted by the accurate value toward @xmath5 oph , both samples are indicative of an interstellar gas - phase o abundance that is appreciably below the solar value of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 741 @xmath11 130 ( grevesse & noels 1993 ) . the key improvement of the ghrs data over the _ copernicus _ data is the greater accuracy of the individual ghrs measurements ( especially of the weaker o i lines ) . in the ghrs data , the largest deviation of o / h from the mean value is 18% compared to a range in the _ copernicus _ data of a factor of 3 .    as reviewed by jenkins ( 1987 ) , the interstellar gas - phase abundances of many elements measured by _ copernicus _ decrease as a function of the mean sightline hydrogen density , @xmath26 @xmath10 @xmath16(h)/@xmath27 , where @xmath27 is the distance to the background star .",
    "these elemental depletions from the gas phase reflect both the growth of dust grains in denser clouds and grain destruction in more diffuse environments . using the stellar distances listed in diplas & savage ( 1994 ) , we have calculated @xmath26 for each of the sightlines in our ghrs and _ copernicus _ samples and plotted them versus the corresponding oxygen abundances in figure 3 .",
    "as might be expected from figure 2 , there is no significant evidence of variations in the gas - phase o abundance as a function of @xmath26 in either sample . although the _ copernicus _ data samples more denser sightlines , the ghrs data pins down the oxygen gas abundance in the most diffuse clouds at a level that is completely consistent with the higher density cases .",
    "the absence of abundance variations as a function of @xmath26 in the ghrs data suggests that there is negligible exchange between gas and dust in these diffuse sightlines and that the total ( gas plus dust ) abundance of oxygen must not vary significantly in the local ism .",
    "a better barometer of diffuse cloud conditions is the fractional abundance of molecular hydrogen , @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) @xmath10 2@xmath16(h@xmath24)/@xmath16(h ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "sightlines separate rather distinctly into groups with low and high @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) values due to the difference between uv transparent and h@xmath24 self - shielding environments . even for weakly depleted elements like ge ( @xcite ) and zn ( @xcite ) , the gas - phase abundances are higher in the low @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) group than in the high group signifying both the presence of dust grains and changes in the elemental dust abundance due to interstellar grain growth and/or destruction .",
    "figure 4 clearly shows that the interstellar gas - phase o abundances measured with ghrs are both well - sampled as a function of @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) and exhibit no dependence on this parameter .",
    "indeed , the mean abundance in the 7 sightlines with log @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) @xmath28 -2.0 ( 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 325 @xmath11 20 ) is essentially the same as that in the 6 sightlines with log @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) @xmath29 -2.0 ( 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 312 @xmath11 19 ) .",
    "thus , any significant reservoir of interstellar oxygen in diffuse clouds other than the atomic gas must be resilient enough to survive in a variety of environments .",
    "under the traditional assumption that the _ cosmic _ elemental abundances reflect those in the solar system , the mean gas - phase abundance of interstellar oxygen measured by ghrs implies an o dust fraction of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 420 .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that an elemental inventory of the likely constituents of interstellar dust yields appreciably less solid - state oxygen than this inferred amount ( @xcite ) . in particular , assuming various mixtures of oxygen - bearing grain compounds such as the silicates pyroxene [ ( mg , fe)sio@xmath30 and olivine [ ( mg , fe)@xmath24sio@xmath31 and oxides like fe@xmath24o@xmath32 , it is difficult to increase the o dust fraction much beyond 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 180 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) simply because the requisite metals are far less abundant than oxygen ( [ o : si : mg : fe]@xmath33 @xmath12 [ 24:1:1:1 ] ) .",
    "if these metals have total ( gas plus dust ) underabundances similar to that derived for oxygen , the implied o dust fraction would be 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 120 instead of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 180 .",
    "it would be hard to hide a significant amount in molecules like co or o@xmath24 in the diffuse sightlines observed by ghrs without leaving any trace of o abundance variations as a function of @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) . for similar reasons ,",
    "the `` missing '' oxygen is unlikely to be locked up in icy grain mantles or ice grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "such carriers would also leave unmistakable signatures like the 3.07 @xmath34 m o - h stretch `` ice '' feature that are not observed in diffuse sightlines ( @xcite ) . thus , unless there is some other resilient form of oxygen in the diffuse ism , it appears clear from our ghrs observations that the _ total _ abundance of interstellar o is about 2/3 of the solar value .",
    "this result is consistent with the conclusions of the previous ghrs oxygen studies ( meyer et al .",
    "1994 , cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) that used subsets of the complete sightline sample presented here .",
    "the possibility that the interstellar oxygen measurements are sampling an overall deficit in local ism elemental abundances has been enhanced by recent ghrs observations of interstellar krypton . based on measurements in ten sightlines , @xcite",
    "find a mean interstellar gas - phase kr abundance that is about 60% of the solar system abundance .",
    "since kr , as a noble gas , should not be depleted much into dust grains , this gas - phase abundance reflects a true interstellar deficit similar to what we find for oxygen .",
    "furthermore , the abundance of krypton , like oxygen , is remarkably homogeneous from sightline to sightline independent of diffuse cloud conditions .",
    "this homogeneity is reflected in figure 5 where we plot the interstellar gas - phase o / kr abundance ratio as a function of @xmath15(h@xmath24 ) for the ghrs sightlines in common between this study and that of @xcite .",
    "the current data are consistent with a picture where the abundances of all of the elements in the local ism are generally about 2/3 of their solar system values ( snow & witt 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the interstellar abundance deficit suggested by the ghrs observations of o and kr fortifies the results of nearby b star measurements of the current epoch abundances of o and other elements ( @xcite ) . as discussed earlier , these studies yield median b - star cno abundances that are also about 2/3 of the solar values .",
    "the implication of this result is that something unusual happened to either the sun or the local ism in the context of standard models of galactic chemical evolution ( @xcite , timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath110.05 dex spread in the interstellar oxygen abundances is appreciably less than the @xmath110.2 dex oxygen spread in orion b stars ( cunha & lambert 1994 ) and the @xmath110.25 dex fe abundance spread in the solar - like star sample of edvardsson et al .",
    "if one believes that these stellar abundance spreads are real and not due to observational error , the question arises as to how to make stars with such large abundance variations out of a very well - mixed ism .",
    "the ghrs data certainly makes it difficult now to explain the solar anomaly simply as the result of a typical ism abundance fluctuation .",
    "there are three models to explain why the ism has a lower oxygen abundance than does the sun .    \\1 . based on isotopic anomalies involving @xmath35al and other elements in meteorites and cosmic rays , the idea that the early solar system was chemically enriched by a local supernova explosion",
    "has long been popular ( @xcite ) . at first glance",
    ", this idea would seem to be a reasonable explanation for the overabundance of oxygen in the sun .",
    "if the solar system originated in a molecular cloud with active ob star formation , a first generation of massive stars could have evolved quickly and enriched the gas in heavy elements such as oxygen which would later be incorporated in the sun .",
    "cunha & lambert ( 1994 ) have found evidence of such a process in the orion ob association where elements such as oxygen , which is produced in abundance by type ii supernovae , exhibit larger abundance spreads in the b stars than do elements like nitrogen . in the context of the edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) study of solar - like stars , if this kind of cloud self - enrichment process were common , it could also explain the stellar fe abundance spread as well as the sun s position near the top .",
    "yet , our ghrs data indicates that the ism abundance inhomogeneities produced by any such process must be quickly damped out .",
    "in particular , our five ghrs orion sightlines yield a spread of only @xmath110.05 dex in their interstellar oxygen gas abundances and a mean value of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 305 @xmath11 24 which is completely consistent with that of the other ghrs sightlines ( 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 325 @xmath11 17 ) . even if this mixing problem can be accommodated through galactic hydrodynamical processes ( roy & kunth 1995 ) , the supernova enrichment hypothesis still faces the challenge of creating similar overabundances for a variety of elements in the sun . for example , in addition to o and kr , the early ghrs results on interstellar nitrogen also yield a 2/3 solar abundance for this element ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) . given the steep relative yield of o to n in type ii supernovae ( @xcite ) as compared to their present - day interstellar abundances , it is difficult to understand how one or more such explosions could have produced similar overabundances of these two elements , let alone others , in the protosolar nebula .    \\2 . as discussed by meyer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and roy & kunth ( 1995 ) , another approach to understanding the underabundance of interstellar oxygen is to invoke a recent infall of metal - poor extragalactic gas in the local milky way . the idea of infall , whether gradual or episodic , has long been recognized as a potentially important component of galactic chemical evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of high - velocity gas in the galactic halo indicate that at least some of these infalling clouds have metallicities as low as 10% solar ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the impact of a @xmath1210@xmath9 m@xmath36 extragalactic cloud with the local milky way some 10@xmath37 years ago could explain the origin and characteristics of the nearby early - type stars and molecular clouds that constitute gould s belt . in terms of the resultant metallicity of the mixed gas , such a collision",
    "could also have diluted the heavy element abundances in the local ism below their solar values .",
    "since this dilution would affect all of the elements in the same way , the similar interstellar underabundances observed for o and kr could easily be explained through an infall model .",
    "conversely , such a model would have serious problems if any element was found not to exhibit this underabundant pattern .",
    "sulfur is a potential candidate to break this pattern since @xcite have measured near - solar interstellar gas - phase s abundances toward three stars with high - quality ghrs data .",
    "however , these abundances are quite uncertain due to the considerable saturation of the s ii @xmath211251,1254,1260 absorption lines and the likely possibility that a significant fraction of the s ii ( which has an ionization potential of 23.3 ev ) originates in h ii regions .",
    "another prediction of the local infall hypothesis would be that the abundances just beyond gould s belt should be closer to the solar values . in terms of the b stars within a kpc or so ,",
    "the data are generally inconclusive on this point with o abundance spreads of about @xmath110.2 dex and no systematic variations found ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in a comprehensive study of b stars over a large range of galactocentric distance ( 6 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath38 18 kpc ) , @xcite find an oxygen abundance gradient of -0.07 @xmath11 0.01 dex kpc@xmath13 that they claim should be representative of the present - day galactic ism .",
    "this large - scale gradient is consistent with that measured for oxygen in h ii regions ( @xcite ) and planetary nebulae ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the small - scale scatter in all of these gradient measures is too large to shed much light on the local infall hypothesis .",
    "@xcite suggest that the sun actually formed in the more metal - rich ism at a galactocentric distance of @xmath39 @xmath10 6.6 @xmath11 0.9 kpc and has migrated over the past 4.6 gyr to its current distance of @xmath39 @xmath10 8.5 kpc .",
    "this scenario is predicated on a very smooth ism metallicity gradient and a process of radial stellar diffusion that would lead to both the sun s enhanced fe metallicity and the observed @xmath110.25 dex spread in the fe abundances of nearby solar - like stars ( edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) . in terms of our ghrs interstellar",
    "o abundances , this idea is attractive because it could explain both the solar oxygen overabundance and how such a well - mixed local ism could co - exist with the much greater metallicity spreads of local stellar populations .",
    "the key challenge for the wielen et al .",
    "scenario is working out the basic mechanism through which the stellar orbits can appreciably migrate radially .",
    "furthermore , based on the @xmath110.2 dex spread of the o abundances in the orion b stars ( cunha & lambert 1994 ) , it is clear that stellar diffusion can not be responsible for every large stellar abundance spread .",
    "all three of these models are subject to future observational tests .",
    "if the abundances of all of the elements in the local ism are 2/3 solar , then the model that the sun was enriched by a local supernova is untenable .",
    "accurate measurements of interstellar abundances at distances greater than 1 kpc will allow us to test models which predict spatial variations of these quantities .",

    "<S> using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ , we have obtained high s / n echelle observations of the weak interstellar o i @xmath01356 absorption toward the stars @xmath1 cas , @xmath2 per , @xmath3 ori , @xmath2 ori , 15 mon , @xmath4 cma , and @xmath1 ara . in combination with previous ghrs measurements in six other sightlines ( @xmath5 per , @xmath6 per , @xmath0 ori , @xmath7 ori , @xmath8 ori , and @xmath5 oph ) , these new observations yield a mean interstellar gas - phase oxygen abundance ( per 10@xmath9 h atoms ) of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 319 @xmath11 14 . </S>",
    "<S> the largest deviation from the mean is less than 18% , and there are no statistically significant variations in the measured o abundances from sightline to sightline and no evidence of density - dependent oxygen depletion from the gas phase . assuming various mixtures of silicates and oxides , the abundance of interstellar oxygen tied up in dust grains </S>",
    "<S> is unlikely to surpass 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath12 180 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ghrs observations imply that the _ total _ abundance of interstellar oxygen ( gas plus grains ) is homogeneous in the vicinity of the sun and about 2/3 of the solar value of 10@xmath9 o / h @xmath10 741 @xmath11 130 . </S>",
    "<S> this oxygen deficit is consistent with that observed in nearby b stars and similar to that recently found for interstellar krypton with ghrs . </S>",
