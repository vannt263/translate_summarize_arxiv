    "<S> _ introduction._the study of two - dimensional lattice models can potentially unveil the nature of exotic materials like unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids . </S>",
    "<S> after their almost simultaneous discovery , high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates @xcite and the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite posed some awkward questions to landau fermi liquid theory . for both systems , the coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong to cause the breakdown of perturbative expansions . in such cases , </S>",
    "<S> the concept of quasiparticles providing a basis for understanding most of condensed - matter phenomena is questionable , and new physics can arise . in cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> the large onsite coulomb repulsion eliminates the double occupancy and changes the statistics of charge carriers , while in the quantum hall phase it leads to the formation of composite fermions . both scenarios manifest deviations from landau fermi liquid behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that many body effects are drastically enhanced in the vicinity of anomalies in the single - particle spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> soon after high - temperature superconductivity was detected in cuprates , it was pointed out that for the optimal doping the fermi level lies in the vicinity of van hove singularities ( vhss ) with divergent density of states ( dos ) , and that in this case the fermi liquid picture can be violated even for a weak interaction , due to singularities of the electron - electron vertex @xcite . the concept of the so - called van hove scenario has been pushed forward to explain a variety of phases associated with the presence of vhss , e.g. , superconductivity , itinerant ferromagnetism , and density waves . if the vhs is near the fermi - level , both antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity can be produced even at small on - site coulomb repulsion , as can be shown from a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite or the parquet approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of exotic ground states is determined by the delicate interplay of these fluctuations , which therefore remain controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold fermi gases in optical lattices @xcite open up completely new opportunities to study exotic states of interacting fermions . today </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental realization of quantum many - body hamiltonians , such as the hubbard model , is a reality and a variety of system parameters such as the hopping , lattice type , and hubbard repulsion can be tuned @xcite . however , despite substantial progress in cooling , the achieved temperatures are still relatively high compared to the effective hopping parameter , so critical temperatures of the low - temperature phases can not be reached . </S>",

    "<S> , we show that a _ precursor _ of a strongly correlated low - temperature instability , possibly chiral superconductivity @xcite , exists at sufficiently high temperatures and that it can be probed in the paramagnetic phase of fermionic cold atoms on a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be understood in terms of _ fermi condensation_.    to clarify this statement , recall that in conventional landau fermi liquid theory @xcite , the free energy is a functional of the quasiparticle distribution function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the particle distribution minimizes this functional , i.e. , @xmath2/\\delta n_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{k}}}}=0 $ ] , which leads to @xmath3,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the dispersion , @xmath5 the chemical potential , and @xmath6 denotes temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this expression reproduces the celebrated fermi distribution @xmath7 . on the other hand </S>",

    "<S> this leads to a restructuring of the distribution function in a certain interval of momenta @xmath11 , where the resulting @xmath1 differs from the fermi distribution , but still minimizes the functional . in the limit @xmath12 , @xmath13 and hence the dispersion </S>",
    "<S> becomes entirely flat in this interval . </S>",
    "<S> in analogy to the bose - einstein condensate , this highly degenerate state has been termed fermi condensation .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea was suggested  @xcite in a purely phenomenological background and remains controversial  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if it exists , a fermi condensate is a new state of matter which is topologically different from both the fermi liquid and the luttinger liquid  @xcite . in the context of the van hove scenario in high - temperature superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi condensation was considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a way to demonstrate that the van hove scenario is not just a scenario at van hove filling and hence for a single point ( an objection from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) ; because of the formation of flat bands , there is a pinning of the fermi energy to the vhs point for a whole range of electron concentrations . </S>",

    "<S> all four interactions are marginal at tree level , but acquire logarithmic corrections from the integration near the vhs , thus justifying the use of logarithmic rg . </S>",

    "<S> one logarithm stems from the dos , whereas the second is inherent to the divergence in the cooper channel for @xmath41 and appears in @xmath42 due to perfect nesting of the fermi surface . for the analysis of the low - energy properties we neglect the logarithmically divergent contributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are parametrically smaller . </S>",
    "<S> restricting the integration region to the patches and placing external momenta at the critical points , we derive one - loop rg equations using momentum - shell integration @xcite with respect to the flow parameter @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that to leading order the solution to a set of rg equations is defined by the relative weight between the peierls and cooper channels only . because of nesting the flow of the coupling constants is strongly modified and the effect of interactions is dramatically enhanced . </S>",

    "<S> the combination of a divergent dos and perfect nesting leads to a rg flow to strong coupling , in agreement with an earlier frg study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the local repulsive coupling can favor the formation of instabilities towards magnetic or superconducting states at relatively high temperatures @xmath48 , e.g. , for the initial values of running couplings @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    even if the interaction strength is weak compared to the fermionic bandwidth @xmath51 .    in order to obtain the renormalized band function we proceed by estimating the second - order correction to the self - energy @xmath52 for @xmath53 near @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> the band function is determined by the pole of the cutoff - independent green s function that can be obtained by solving the corresponding dyson equation , whereas the effects of spectrum renormalization , which describe the flattening , can be absorbed into mass renormalization factors . </S>",
