    "schtzenberger s factorization @xcite has been introduced and plays a central role in the renormalization @xcite of associators , was obtained , in @xcite , with explicit coefficients which are polyztas and regularized polyztas ( see @xcite for the computation of the other associators involving only convergent polyztas as local coordinates , and for three algorithmical process to regularize the divergent polyztas ) . ] which are formal power series in non commutative variables @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of these power series are polynomial at positive integral multi - indices of riemann s zta function @xcite and they satisfy quadratic relations @xcite which can be explained through the lyndon words @xcite .    these quadratic relations can be obtained by identification of the local coordinates , in infinite dimension , on a bridge equation connecting the cauchy and hadamard algebras of the polylogarithmic functions and using the factorizations , by lyndon words , of the non commutative generating series of polylogarithms @xcite and of harmonic sums @xcite .",
    "this bridge equation is mainly a consequence of the double isomorphy between these algebraic structures to respectively the shuffle @xcite and quasi - shuffle ( or stuffle ) @xcite algebras both admitting the lyndon words as a transcendence basis @xcite .    in order to better understand the mechanisms of the shuffle product and to obtain algorithms on quasi - shuffle products ,",

    "we will extend the schtzenberger s factorization by developping the combinatorial hopf algebra of this product in a parallel way with that of the shuffle and in emphasizing the lie elements studied by ree @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will give an effective construction ( implemented in maple @xcite ) of pair of bases in duality ( see propositions [ checksigma ] and [ increasinglyndon ] ) .",
    "this construction uses essentially an adapted version of the eulerian projector and its adjoint @xcite in order to obtain the primitive elements of the @xmath0-stuffle hopf algebra ( see definition [ pi1 ] ) .",
