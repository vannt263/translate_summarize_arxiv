    "our understanding on the low energy strong interaction physics is still unsatisfactory though quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been established as the standard theory of strong interaction for many years .",
    "because of its color confinement non - perturbative properties , we have difficulties to calculate the properties of mesons and baryons directly from qcd .",
    "constituent quark models are developed to explain the mesonic and baryonic spectrum and they are successful in some aspects .",
    "but one of severe problems is that they predict more excited states around 2 gev than what have been observed experimentally . as a result",
    ", a lot of efforts have been devoted to the meson production in pion- , photo- , and electro - induced reactions in order to reduce the uncertainties of extracted parameters of resonances , deepen our knowledge on the structure of the resonances and search for missing resonances .",
    "in the past few years , the double pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions tends to be a fascinating field for studying resonances properties and has been accurately measured at the facilities of celsius@xcite , cosy@xcite , kek@xcite , and pnpi - gatchina@xcite . in the table  [ data ] , we list all the data measured after the year of 2000 . the celsius@xcite and cosy@xcite collaboration measured the differential cross sections of @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels for the beam energies from the threshold to 1.3 gev .",
    "one of the promising findings was that the @xmath3 contribution dominates at the close - to - threshold region , as expected by the valencia model@xcite .",
    "this provided us a good place to explore the properties of @xmath3 whose theoretical interpretation is still under controversial . however the valencia model , though compatible with the old bubble chamber and magnetic spectrometer data@xcite , overestimated the new data at the close - to - threshold energies by several times .",
    "another finding was that the celsius data of @xmath10 invariant mass spectra for the beam energies above 1.0 gev demonstrated a single peak at the low invariant mass while the model gave double hump structure which was inconsistent to the data .",
    "the model also predicted a preferential parallel emission of the two pion - meson , which was contrary to the celsius data .",
    "the third interesting finding was that there was a level - off behavior around the beam energies of 1.0 gev in the energy dependence of the @xmath9 , which was thought to be the result of interference between different contributions .",
    "kek collaboration made another progress and they measured the total cross section of @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels which were important for our understanding on the excitation of @xmath3 .    on the other side , though the role of @xmath3 in nucleon - nucleon collisions was firmly established , its contribution in @xmath7 reactions has never been considered .",
    "jetset@xcite measured the @xmath13 channel in order to search for narrow resonances decaying to @xmath14 but they only included the double-@xmath2 diagram in their monte - carlo simulation .",
    "moreover , it has never been explored whether it was possible to extract the properties of other resonances from antinucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the one - pion exchange ( ope ) models@xcite of more than 45 years ago only considered the double-@xmath2 diagram and the valencia model of more than 10 years ago made a further step by including also the @xmath3 resonance and the @xmath15- and @xmath16-meson exchange . with the new accurate data ,",
    "it is very necessary to perform a more comprehensive analysis including more resonances and matching all the data of ( anti)nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "our full model is demonstrated in ref .",
    ", so herein we only give a brief description to the main features .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the resonances in our model are based on a lorentz covariant orbital - spin ( l - s ) scheme  @xcite . in view of the overall system invariant mass about 2.8 gev for tp = 2.2 gev , we have checked contributions from all the well - established @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances below 1.72 gev .",
    "the coupling constants appearing in relevant resonances are determined by the empirical partial decay width of the resonances taken from particle data group ( pdg ) book@xcite .",
    "our calculated results show that the @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 resonances play the relatively significant role in the considered energies and other resonances give negligible contributions  @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the adjustable parameters are the cut - off values in form factors at vertices and resonances .",
    "we include five types of form factors : those at the meson-(anti)nucleon-(anti)nucleon vertices , those at the meson-@xmath17(@xmath18)-(anti)nucleon vertices , the blatt - weisskopf barrier factors at the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath22 vertex  @xcite , the form factor at the @xmath15-@xmath22-@xmath22 vertex , and the form factor of resonances and nucleon poles .",
    "the @xmath23 channel is very useful to pin down these cut - off values in form factors of the relevant @xmath2 and @xmath18 resonances because it has negligible @xmath17 contribution , and then we could easily determine the cut - off values of @xmath17 resonances in other channels .",
    "if the double-@xmath2 mechanism is dominant at high energies as in the ope model and valencia model , the total cross section of @xmath24 should be a factor of about four larger than that of @xmath23 according to isospin coefficients .",
    "however , the new exclusive measurements indicate an approximately equal value of these two channels , which is consistent to the old bubble - chamber data@xcite . after calculating all the possible contributions , our model got two important conclusions :",
    "our model reduces the relative branching ratio of @xmath25 and assumes a smaller cutoff parameter for the @xmath26 coupling so the relative contribution from the @xmath27 term increases significantly .",
    "our model introduces significant contributions from @xmath28 at energies near threshold and from @xmath20 and @xmath21 at energies above 1.5 gev .",
    "this is more obvious in the @xmath23 channel because the isospin coefficients of these terms are much bigger than those in other channels .    as a result ,",
    "our description of the total cross sections of all isospin channels is considerably improved and our results agree well with the new data of @xmath29 collisions in the close - to - threshold region .",
    "however , we find that it is difficult to interpret the @xmath10 invariant mass spectra for the beam energies above 1.0 gev and the level - off behavior around 1.0 gev in the total cross section of the @xmath9 channel . in fig .",
    "[ pipidis ] , we give the invariant mass spectra and angular distribution of the opening angle for @xmath30 system in the overall center - of - mass system in the @xmath9 channel at the beam energies of 795 mev and 1300 mev . at 795 mev , which is close to the threshold , the @xmath3 is dominant and the given spectra is consistent to the data . at 1300",
    "mev the model fails to describe the data because the @xmath25 , which is significant at high energies , gives a double hump structure in the @xmath30 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "but if the @xmath3 contribution is negligible which is caused by some kind of destructively interference in this energy region , then the double-@xmath2 diagram , which is dominant by @xmath22-meson exchange in our model , describe the data well@xcite .",
    "the situation is similar in the @xmath31 channel .",
    "our model provide essential hints to the abc effect in @xmath32 reaction@xcite . in fig  [ pppipi00 ]",
    "we show the total cross section of @xmath33 channel .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath34 and @xmath25 are significant in all the considered energies . at the close - to - threshold region ,",
    "the nucleon poles are very important .",
    "so it is suggested that the @xmath3 resonance and nucleon poles should be carefully considered before we reach the right conclusion@xcite .",
    "the agreement between our model and the data of @xmath35 collisions is good@xcite .",
    "it should be addressed that the @xmath3 and other resonances should be included in the monte - carlo simulation of the experimental analysis in order to get the correct total cross sections from limited measured phase space , which is overlooked by the previous measurements .",
    "we find that the @xmath36 reaction is useful to determine the model parameters because like the @xmath23 reaction , the @xmath17 contribution is small .",
    "we also point out that other channels in antinucleon - nucleon collisions could serve as a good place for studying baryon resonances .",
    "a lot of precise measurements in nucleon - nucleon collisions are being carried out by celsius and cosy collaborations in order to study @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances . besides ,",
    "the hades collaboration has measured some channels of @xmath29 collisions at the beam energies of 1.25 gev@xcite and their results are expected to come soon , so this will constitute a good test of our model . recently , a cooler storage ring hirfl - csr , which can produce the proton beam with similar beam energy range of cosy , has already been successfully installed at lanzhou . with the scheduled 4@xmath22 hadronic detector for complete measurement of diverse differential cross sections",
    ", it will have a special advantage for studying excited nucleon states through nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "we also suggest that the double pion production in antinucleon - nucleon collisions should be measured at panda ( anti - proton annihilation at darmstadt ) at the gsi facility of antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , which could provide the antiproton beam of kinetic energy ranging from 1 to 15 gev with the luminosity of about @xmath37 .",
    "we address that panda could play an important role in the hadronic physics with a 4@xmath22 solid angle detector with good particle identification for charged particles and photons .",
    "the planned new experiments are anticipated to offer more tools and information to help us understanding the low energy physics better .",
    "useful discussions with c. wilkin , members of celsius and hades collaborations are gratefully acknowledged .",
