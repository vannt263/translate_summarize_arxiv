    "most solar atmospheric features with varying degrees of complexity ( i.e. , active regions , prominences , filaments , loops , etc . ) are thought to be shaped by magnetic fields emerging from the solar interior due to the buoyancy instability @xcite .",

    "in fact , highly twisted flux tubes store magnetic energy that is necessary for the heating and acceleration of the plasma in the erupting structures .",
    "x - ray observations have shown that the majority of the active regions leading to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) have an s - shaped structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the crucial role played by twisted flux tubes in the formation of topologically complex flux ropes and their evolution into solar eruptive phenomena , such as cmes .",
    "simulations of flux emergence from the convective zone into the upper atmosphere showed that untwisted flux tubes suffer convective stresses leading to their fragmentation and impeding their emergence to the upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "it has been found that some degree of twist in rising flux tubes is needed to avoid the conversion of the tube into vortex pairs @xcite .",
    "it has also been reported that the flux reaching the upper atmosphere depends on both the field strength at the bottom of the convective zone ( simulation box ) and the degree of twist of the rising flux tube @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms have been invoked to be at the origin of the twist of rising flux tubes : ( 1 ) helical turbulent motions @xcite ; ( 2 ) coriolis force @xcite ; ( 3 ) differential rotation @xcite ; ( 4 ) helicity generation by the solar dynamo @xcite ; ( 5 ) turbulent diffusion of wrapped poloidal flux into the rising flux tube @xcite .",

    "@xcite studied the topology of the emerging flux tube in a @xmath1-sunspot and found a rather simple structure at the start with increasing topological complexity .",

    "a c - class flare in the active region ar10938 led to the brightening of the magnetic structure showing its fine structure in an unprecedented manner .",
    "the fine structure of the magnetic system is best seen in xrt images at approximately 3:00 ut and with better contrast in euvi - a 171   and 195   data at about 3:30 ut .",
    "it is very unlikely that the observed complex topology is the result of projection effects .",
    "xrt data suggests that the indicated flux rope was present prior to the flare and its appearance is the result of heating processes related to the flare eruption .",
    "this led to emissions in hot spectral lines observed by eis , followed by a cooling phase through x - rays and euv , and ultimately the gradual disappearance of the system .",
    "h@xmath0 and 304   data reveal the presence of dark fibrils aligned along the suggested flux rope .",
    "these structures were present before the appearance of the magnetic thread system .",
    "the x - ray and euv threads suggest a high degree of linking as shown by the formation of a segment of an inverse s - shaped filament in the same location later - on conveying a left - handed helical pattern for the loop system .",
    "we believe that the dark fibrils are part of a filament channel and the indicated flux rope is a segment of the filament .",
    "the latter runs along the neutral line across the active region .",
    "it is well developed north of ar10938 and of filamentary nature elsewhere .",
    "this is supported by the presence of a loop arcade presumably laying above the multi - thread system , which is necessary for the formation of filaments .",
    "304   observations show a dark , denser structure that formed about 8 hours after the brightening of the suggested flux rope .",
    "this evolved further into a wider feature in the following days reflecting the formation of the filament which is also supported by the presence of prominences when the active region was near the solar limb .",
    "the present study should be useful for constraining models of filament formation .",
    "the role of the magnetic field topology , in terms of twist and shear , is a matter of debate concerning the processes of the filament formation .",
    "an important aspect is how and when ( with respect to the eruptive phase of filaments ) the confinement of the magnetic fields occurs .",
    "two types of models are proposed to address these questions .",
    "the first class is flux rope based models which assume a high degree of twist from the start of solar filaments formation @xcite .",
    "the second class considers highly sheared arcades along magnetic inversion lines to be the base of the filament , where the helical structure of magnetic field occurs only during the eruptive phase for the latter type of models @xcite .",
    "although the present work is not meant to discriminate between the two classes of models , it indicates the presence of a flux rope prior to the filament formation .",
    "we believe that it favors the first class .",
    "the processes of the plasma condensation in the loop system leading to the filament formation remain unclear .",
    "it is likely that the flux tube emerged twisted from the convection zone .",
    "photospheric shear motions may also contribute to the twist of the flux tube . however , shear transfer during the flare , which led to the brightening of the thread system , may be more plausible .",
    "the shear within the non - eruptive flaring structure should remain within the system .",
    "the only plausible way for this to happen is to increase the topological complexity of neighboring magnetic structures .",
