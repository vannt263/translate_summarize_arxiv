    "the low - mass scalar mesons have fundamental importance in understanding the theory and phenomenology of low energy qcd . from the experimental point of view , isoscalar @xmath5 and isovector @xmath6 are well established , but the nature and the quark substructure of these scalar mesons , whether they are conventional @xmath7 states @xcite , @xmath8 molecules @xcite , or multiquark exotic @xmath9 states @xcite , have been a subject of controversy . on the other hand , since they are relevant hadronic degrees of freedom , besides the questions of their nature , the roles of scalar mesons in the hadronic processes must be studied .    the radiative decay processes of the type @xmath10 where v and p belong to the lowest multiplets of vector ( v ) and pseudoscalar ( p ) mesons have become a subject of renewed interest because they offer the possibility of investigating the new physics features governing meson physics in the low energy region .",
    "although these rare decays have small branching ratios due to absence of bremsstrahlung radiation , their study offers the possibility of testing the theoretical ideas about the interesting mechanisms of these decays , as well as shedding light on the structure of intermediate states involved in these decays .",
    "particularly interesting are the exchange mechanisms of scalar resonances contributing to these decays .",
    "the radiative decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 were studied using a low energy effective lagrangian approach with gauged wess - zumino terms @xcite , and later by using standard lagrangians obeying su(3)-symmetry @xcite . in both of these calculations",
    "scalar meson intermediate state contributions were neglected and the contributions of intermediate vector mesons were taken into account .",
    "however , it is of interest to study the contribution of @xmath0-intermediate state to these decays as well , and for that a knowledge of @xmath13- and @xmath14-vertexes are needed .    in this work",
    ", we estimate the coupling constant g@xmath15 and g@xmath16 by employing qcd sum rules which provide an efficient method to study hadronic properties and which have been employed to study hadronic observables such as decay constants and form factors in terms of nonperturbative contributions proportional to the quark and gluon condensates @xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach @xcite is a model independent method to study the properties of hadrons through correlation functions of appropriately chosen currents .",
    "we choose the interpolating currents for @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons as @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ; and for @xmath0 meson as @xmath21 @xcite , and we work in the su(2 ) flavour limit m@xmath22 . in the sum rule ,",

    "@xcite we studied the scalar - isoscalar @xmath24 meson by considering the two - point scalar current correlation function . since perturbative and qcd - vacuum condensate contributions to scalar current correlation functions can not distinguish between isoscalar and isovector channels , we follow here the same method and we study the scalar - isovector @xmath0 meson by considering the two - point current correlation function @xmath25 the two - loop expression for the scalar current correlation function @xmath26 in perturbative qcd was calculated @xcite , and for light quark systems in the limit @xmath27 it is given by the expression @xmath28\\right\\}~~.\\ ] ] qcd - vacuum condensate contributions to the scalar current correlation function @xmath29 were obtained by the operator product method @xcite in the same limit @xmath30=0 as @xmath31 let us note that the term @xmath32 is independent of quark mass since it is given as @xmath33 through gell - mann - oakes - renner relation @xcite .",

    "the threshold is choosen below a possible @xmath48 pole and it is varied between s@xmath38=1.6 - 1.7 gev@xmath49 . since the borel parameter has no physical meaning , we look for a range of its values where the sum rule is almost independent of m@xmath49 , we choose the interval of values of borel parameter m@xmath49 as 1.2 - 2.0 gev@xmath49 . the overlap amplitude @xmath43 as a function of m@xmath49 in this interval for different values of s@xmath50 is shown in fig . 1 from which by choosing the middle value m@xmath49=1.6 gev@xmath49 in it is interval of variation",

    ", we consider the double dispersion relation for the vertex function @xmath59 @xmath60 where the possible subtraction terms are neglected since they will not make any contribution after double borel transform . for low values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the spectral function @xmath63 contains a term proportional to double @xmath64-function @xmath65 , corresponding to the transition @xmath66 where v denotes @xmath17 or @xmath58 meson .",
    "we therefore saturate the dispersion relation satisfied by the vertex function @xmath59 by these lowest lying meson states in the vector and the scalar channels , and this way we obtain for the physical part @xmath67 where the contributions from the higher states and the continuum is denoted by dots .",

    "the theoretical part of the sum rule is obtained by calculating the perturbative contribution and the power corrections from operators of different dimensions to the three point correlation function @xmath59 .",
    "for the perturbative contribution we consider the lowest order bare - loop diagrams shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , we consider the power corrections from the operators of different dimensions that are proportional to vacuum condensates @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    ". we do not consider the gluon condensate contribution proportional to @xmath80 since it is estimated to be negligible for light quark systems .",
    "we perform the calculations of the power corrections in the fixed point gauge @xcite .",
    "we work in the limit @xmath27 , and in this limit perturbative bare - loop diagram does not make any contribution . moreover , in this limit only operators of dimensions d=3 and d=5 make contributions that are proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for power corrections are shown fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) .",

    "3 , examination of which indicates that it is quite stable with these reasonable variations of @xmath52 and @xmath101 . we choose the middle value @xmath103 for the borel parameter in its interval of variation and we obtain the coupling constant g@xmath16 as g@xmath104 .",
    "we indicate the error arising from the numerical analysis of the sum rule as well as from the uncertainties in the estimated values of the vacuum condensates . in fig .",

    "the values for the coupling constants g@xmath16 and g@xmath15 that we obtain are in agreement with the expected su(3 ) ratio g@xmath15:g@xmath16=3:1 .    in our analysis",
    ", we use for the overlap amplitudes @xmath106 and @xmath107 the values that we obtain from the experimental electronic decay widths of @xmath17 and @xmath58 mesons . on the other hand",
    ", it may be argued that in a qcd sum rules calculation it is more appropriate to use the values of the overlap amplitudes that are also determined within the framework of qcd sum rules method .",
    "electromagnetic decays of vector mesons using qcd sum rules were studied @xcite , and in their analysis the authors used the values of the overlap amplitudes @xmath108 and @xmath109 that they also determined utilizing qcd sum rules .",
    "if we use instead these values of the overlap amplitudes in our calculation we then obtain the coupling constants g@xmath16 and g@xmath15 as g@xmath110 and g@xmath111 which are consistent with our above results .    in the investigations of the role of @xmath0 meson in hadronic processes ,",
    "the relevant coupling constants of @xmath0 meson are needed . in this work",
    ", we employed qcd sum rules approach to estimate the coupling constants g@xmath16 and g@xmath15 . we feel that the studies of the different coupling constants of @xmath0 meson should be continued . in particular qcd sum rules calculations should be improved by taking into account the high order corrections to the perturbative part of the three point correlation function and also to the two point correlation function employed in the estimation of the overlap amplitude of @xmath0 meson .",
