    "just as explicit solutions of the einstein and hermitian - yang - mills equations exist only on spaces that are either low dimensional , non - compact and/or highly symmetric , so the equations for special lagrangian ( slag ) cycles , also important in physics , have the same properties .",
    "physically there are also similarities in that we have two first order supersymmetric minimal energy equations ( hyms and slag ) implying the more standard second order equations ( yms and minimal volume equations )",
    ".    there are powerful existence results of calabi and yau ( and more recently tian , donaldson and others ) for the einstein equations , and of donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau for the hym equations , so long as we are on a khler ( or projective ) manifold ; this often reduces an infinite dimensional problem in pdes to a finite dimensional problem in linear algebra .",
    "producing many khler - einstein ( e.g. calabi - yau ) manifolds becomes trivial , and dealing with hermitian - yang - mills connections requires only algebraic computations ; in both cases the complicated role of the khler form and/or metric is almost removed .",
    "this can be thought of as possible because of the existence of some infinite dimensional geometry recasting the equations in terms of moment maps and symplectic reduction .",
    "a similar situation for slags would therefore be highly desirable .",
    "in particular it might give a way of studying slags using only lagrangians and symplectic geometry , much as hym connections are studied via stable bundles and algebraic geometry .",
    "this paper explores the mirror symmetry of holomorphic bundles ( on a calabi - yau @xmath1-fold @xmath2 , often referred to here as ` the complex side ' ) and lagrangians ( on the mirror calabi - yau 3-fold @xmath3 , the symplectic side , known as the khler side in the physics literature ) .",
    "many people have worked and are still working on proving some kind of direct correspondence between such objects given an syz torus fibration @xcite ; see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and see @xcite for a review of this and many many more issues in mirror symmetry . here , however , we work purely formally without reference to a particular pair of mirror manifolds , without worrying about what mirror symmetry might rigorously mean , and we will not try to give any explicit correspondence . using mirror symmetry merely as motivation",
    ", we point out some similar structures on both sides of the mirror map . under some conditions ( in some ` large complex structure ' or ` semi - classical ' or somesuch limit ) these structures",
    "might be genuinely dual ; again it does not matter if they are not in general .",
    "for instance , physics @xcite , @xcite predicts that one should consider not the hym equations and slope but some perturbation of them away from the large complex structure limit ; however these equations also come from a moment map and , conjecturally , a stability condition ( for a discussion of such matters see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "so while the slope and phase of lagrangians discussed below might not be exactly mirror to slope of bundles , it should be mirror to something with analogous properties and significance .",
    "loosely , we would like to think of submanifolds in a fixed homology class as mirror to connections on a fixed topological complex bundle ( with chern classes mirror to the homology class ) ; then lagrangians should correspond to holomorphic connections ( i.e. integrable connections ; those with no @xmath4-curvature ) and special lagrangians to those with hym curvature .",
    "these last two conditions should be stability conditions for the group actions of hamiltonian deformations and complex gauge transformations , respectively .",
    "the full picture is much more complicated , involving triangulated categories and so forth , as envisaged some six years ago in the seminal conjecture of kontsevich @xcite ; we can ignore this in only using mirror symmetry as motivation .",
    "it could be noted , however , that the functionals defined below are additive under exact sequences of holomorphic vector bundles and sums of lagrangians , so should extend to the derived category of coherent sheaves and the derived fukaya category of lagrangians respectively",
    ".    first note that while the connections side has a complex structure and a complex gauge group involved , the lagrangian side needs complexifying .",
    "so motivated by kontsevich @xcite and by physics ( e.g. @xcite ) we add in connections on the submanifolds ( which will later reduce to flat connections on lagrangians ) .",
    "the dictionary we are aiming towards , much of which is already standard , is the following in the 3-dimensional case ; all the terms used will be defined in due course .",

    "it is infinitesimally gauge - invariant ( gauge transformations not homotopic to the identity can give periods to @xmath20 ) and its gradient is @xmath21 , with zeros the integrable connections .",
    "that is , after dividing by gauge equivalence ( under which grad@xmath22 is invariant ) , the critical points of @xmath20 form the space of holomorphic bundles of the same topological type . as critical points of a functional , moduli of holomorphic bundles have virtual dimension zero , and one might try to make sense of counting them  a holomorphic casson invariant @xcite .",

    "@xmath25 is a fixed cycle in the same homology class , and we integrate over a 4-chain with boundary @xmath26 ; the functional @xmath27 is invariant under the choice of different , homologous , 4-chains ( picking non - homologous 4-chains can give periods to @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is invariant under deformations of @xmath13 pulled back from hamiltonian deformations of @xmath3 ( deformations generated by vector fields @xmath28 on @xmath3 whose contraction with @xmath24 is exact @xmath29 at each point in time ) as @xmath30 , and its gradient is @xmath31 .",
    "thus its critical points are lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "we would like to think of @xmath27 as mirror to @xmath20 , but to do so we must complexify it .",
    "thus we work on the space @xmath16 of submanifolds @xmath13 of @xmath3 with @xmath32 connections @xmath18 on the trivial bundle @xmath33 on @xmath13 .",
    "notice these submanifolds are not parameterised by a map of a real 3-manifold into @xmath3 ; we are only interested in the image @xmath13 .",
    "_ from now on we shall restrict attention to smooth lagrangian submanifolds . _ formally , we consider the tangent space to @xmath16 at a point @xmath34 to be @xmath35 at least for those @xmath13 with no @xmath36-invariant subspaces of its tangent spaces ( @xmath36 is the complex structure on @xmath3 , and this is reasonable since we are looking for lagrangian submanifolds after all ) .",
    "the first factor is the obvious tangent space to the connections on @xmath13 ; the second gives deformations of @xmath13 via the vector fields produced by contracting with the khler form @xmath24 on @xmath3 .",
    "that is , we use the metric on @xmath3 to map @xmath37 to @xmath38 , then use the isomorphism provided by @xmath24 to get a vector field along @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently , using the metric on @xmath3 , we may think of one - forms on @xmath13 as tangent vectors to @xmath13 , then apply the complex structure @xmath36 on @xmath3 to give @xmath3-vector fields on @xmath13 .",
    "we denote this map from one - forms to normal vector fields by @xmath39 connections on @xmath13 are carried along by the vector field to connections on nearby cycles , and we are identifying the space of @xmath32 connections with @xmath40 .",
    "there is a natural almost complex structure on @xmath16 , acting as    @xmath41 with respect to the splitting ( [ tsp ] ) of the tangent spaces . with respect to this",
    "we claim to have the following holomorphic functional @xmath42 here we have extended @xmath18 to a connection on the trivial bundle on the whole of @xmath3 ( restricting to a fixed connection @xmath43 on @xmath25 , and to @xmath18 on @xmath13 ) and taken its curvature form @xmath44 .",
    "we have again picked a 4-cycle bounding @xmath26 ; because @xmath44 and @xmath24 are closed the resulting functional is independent of different homologous choices of the 4-cycle , and in general well defined up to the addition of some discrete periods .",
    "it is also ( again ) independent of hamiltonian isotopies of @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the @xmath45 term is just the _ real _ chern - simons functional @xmath46 of the connection @xmath18 on @xmath13 , whose critical points are well known to be flat connections .",
    "as pointed out to me by eric zaslow , the real and complex chern - simons functionals already appear in @xcite and @xcite as possible mirror partners ( this is partially justified in @xcite ) , but without the terms in the symplectic form ( and including instanton corrections from holomorphic discs which we are ignoring for our rough analogy ) . asking for a real function to be equal to a complex one",
    "is possible when one restricts attention to a real slice such as the space of _ lagrangian _ submanifolds in @xmath16 ; deforming within this space the imaginary part of @xmath47 remains constant and it reduces to @xmath46 . but allowing the imaginary counterparts to these real deformations the right functional to consider is @xmath47 .",
    "notice also that if @xmath48 is integral , so that we can pick a connection @xmath49 with curvature @xmath50 , then the action functional can be written in the more familiar looking chern - simons form @xmath51 for the ` complexified connection ' @xmath52 ( a @xmath53-connection , instead of a @xmath32-connection . )",
    "this makes more contact with the physics literature and allows one to extend the identification of @xmath46 and @xmath20 in @xcite to non lagrangian sections , giving complex values .",
    "tian has informed me that he and chen have also considered the functional @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "mirror symmetry should relate lagrangians not just to bundles but the whole derived category . for riemann surfaces @xmath55 , for instance , there is a functional in @xcite , @xcite rather like @xmath27 above : @xmath56 is formally holomorphic and has as critical points the _ holomorphic _ curves @xmath57 . similarly for four - manifolds @xmath58 with connections on them the following functional ( formally similar to @xmath47 ) @xmath59 has critical points the holomorphic surfaces with flat connection on them .",
    "alternatively , as @xmath20 is additive under extensions of bundles it does extend to the derived category .",
    "( whether these two approaches are compatible ; i.e. whether or not the functional associated to a curve or surface is the same as @xmath20 applied to a locally free resolution of its structure sheaf , up to a constant , seems to not have been worked out . )",
    "that @xmath47 is holomorphic follows from the computation that the derivative of @xmath47 down @xmath60 ( that only changes the connection @xmath61 ) is @xmath62 , while the derivative down @xmath63 , i.e. down the vector field @xmath64 , is @xmath65 .",
    "the second expression is @xmath66 times the first , so the derivative is complex linear and @xmath67 is holomorphic .",
    "equivalently we are saying that @xmath68 is the 2-form @xmath69 which pairs with the tangent space ( [ tsp ] ) by integration over @xmath13 to give a form of type ( 1,0 ) on ( [ tsp ] ) .",
    "thus critical points of the functional are lagrangian cycles with flat line bundles on them : exactly the basic building blocks of the objects proposed in @xcite to be mirror dual to the holomorphic bundles that are the critical points of @xmath70 .",
    "so this ties in three well known moduli problems of virtual dimension zero ( i.e. with deformation theories whose euler characteristic vanishes ) ",
    "flat bundles on 3-manifolds , holomorphic bundles on calabi - yau 3-folds , and lagrangians ( up to hamiltonian deformation ) in symplectic 6-manifolds .",
    "so as mirror to @xcite one would like to count lagrangians ( up to hamiltonian deformations ) plus flat line bundles on them , and this is what joyce s work @xcite has begun to tackle ( in the rigid case of @xmath13 being a homology sphere ) . mirroring precisely the behaviour of the holomorphic casson invariant this count appears to be independent of deformations of the khler form and to have wall - crossing changes as the complex structure varies .",
    "in fact what joyce is proposing to count is _ special _ lagrangian spheres with flat line bundles on them ( hence the otherwise anomalous dependence on the complex structure ) , while @xcite counts _ stable _ bundles ( i.e. by donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau , modulo the technicalities of polystable and non - locally - free sheaves , we count _ hermitian - yang - mills _ connections ; hence the dependence on the khler form ) .",
    "( tyurin @xcite was perhaps the first to suggest that the holomorphic casson invariant should be related by mirror symmetry to the real casson invariant ( here the @xmath32 casson invariant ) of slag submanifolds . )",
    "the link should be , of course , that we want to consider holomorphic connections on one side , up to complex gauge equivalence , and lagrangians on the other side , up to hamiltonian isotopy , and in both cases we try to do this by picking distinguished representatives of equivalence classes by the usual method of symplectic reduction . bringing in a khler structure on the complex side ,",
    "we get a moment map for the gauge group action , whose zeros give the hym equations .",
    "dually , we would like to bring in the holomorphic 3-form on the symplectic ( khler ) side , and get a complex group to act . so again",
    "complexify by adding flat line bundles : consider the critical points of the functional @xmath67 of the last section , i.e. the space @xmath71 ( _ not _ up to gauge equivalence ) .",
    "in fact consider this space on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath3 of any dimension @xmath72 .",
    "it has tangent space @xmath73 ( @xmath74 denotes closed real one - forms on @xmath13 ) , the first being tangent to the space of flat connections , the second giving normal vector fields ( by contracting with @xmath75 ) preserving the lagrangian condition .",
    "we have an obvious almost complex structure @xmath76    then the real group @xmath77 acts as the lie algebra to the group of gauge transformations on the flat line bundles ( taking @xmath78 and adding to the connection ) whose complexification @xmath79 acts complex linearly : the imaginary part @xmath77 acts by hamiltonian deformations through the normal vector field @xmath80 unfortunately , without using a metric this vector field is only defined up to the addition of tangent vector fields to @xmath13 ; the map ( [ ip ] ) is really a map to @xmath81 which we have lifted to @xmath82 using the metric .",
    "( equivalently we can extend @xmath83 to a first formal neighbourhood of @xmath13 in different ways to get a different vector field . )",
    "how we pick this alters how we carry the flat connection along with @xmath13 , and how the almost complex structure ( [ aha ] ) acts .",
    "for instance suppose we are in the rather artificial case of @xmath13 being transverse to an syz @xmath84-fibration .",
    "then we can carry @xmath13 and the flat connection up the fibres and identify the functions @xmath85 from lagrangian to lagrangian using the projection .",
    "thus the group remains constant as @xmath13 moves ( effectively what we are doing is extending functions from @xmath13 to a neighbourhood of @xmath13 in @xmath3 by pulling up along the syz fibres ) .",
    "this does not work when @xmath13 branches over the base of such a fibration .",
    "one can instead use the metric to define normal vector fields , but then identifying the lie algebra @xmath85 with a fixed @xmath86 for all @xmath13 becomes difficult .",
    "this problem is perhaps not so surprising  the moment the lagrangian has branching over the base of an syz fibration simple explicit correspondences between lagrangians and vector bundles ( such as @xcite ) also break down due to our ignoring important holomorphic disc instanton corrections that appear in the physics .",
    "for instance recent work of fukaya , oh , ohta and ono @xcite , surveyed in @xcite , show these provide the obstructions mirror to those of deformations of holomorphic bundles @xcite  one should not in general consider all ( s)lags ( which are unobstructed ) as mirror to holomorphic bundles , but only those whose floer cohomology ( whose definition involves holomorphic discs ) is well defined .",
    "however , what is clear is the totality of the group action , even if identifying individual elements causes problems , and this is all we really need .",
    "for instance in the @xmath87 ( or @xmath88 ) case one can get the same total group orbit , with a genuine fixed group acting , by hyperkhler rotating a construction due to donaldson @xcite .",
    "the end result is that one considers parametrised lagrangian embeddings @xmath67 from a riemann surface @xmath13 into the @xmath87 such that the pullback of re@xmath9 is a fixed symplectic form on @xmath13 .",
    "then the group of exact symplectomorphisms of @xmath89 provide a symmetry group of the space of maps @xmath67 , which also carries a natural khler structure .",
    "complexified orbits give hamiltonian deformations , and the moment map is @xmath90 .",
    "the connection with our construction is that after fixing a line bundle @xmath91 and connection with curvature @xmath92 , an infinitesimal symplectomorphism @xmath10 induces a flat connection , via parallel transport and pull back , on the bundle @xmath93 .",
    "globally the action is different ( this action has non - zero lie bracket , for instance , and a fixed group ) but the total group orbit and the moment map ( see below ) are the same .    in general",
    "it is clear that the problem of identifying the group for different embeddings of @xmath13 should be resolved by working with the space of maps from a fixed @xmath25 to @xmath3 , and enlarging the group by including diffeomorphisms of @xmath25 , giving a semi - direct product of diff@xmath94 and @xmath32 gauge transformations on @xmath25 .",
    "then the moment map for the diffeomorphism part of the total group would be the lagrangian condition as in @xcite , and the problems we are encountering would come from the fact that the group is a semi - direct product and not a product , so that we can not separate the two out and divide by them separately , as in effect we have been trying to do .",
    "unfortunately , i have not found the correct formulation of the problem , but it is not so important for follows .",
    "so we shall not worry too much about whether the complex structure defined above is integrable , the group is fixed , or the symplectic structure below is closed . in 1 complex dimension it is trivial , in 2 we can use donaldson s picture , and in 3 dimensions we could either try to use an abstract syz fibration to deform and identify lagrangians transverse to it , or take everything in this section as motivation for finding the stability condition for lagrangians of the next section .    fix a homology class of lagrangians and multiply @xmath14 by a unit norm complex number so that @xmath95 .",
    "we induce a symplectic structure on @xmath96 from @xmath36 and the following metric on the tangent space @xmath97 for @xmath98 closed 1-forms .",
    "a computation in local coordinates shows this is symmetric in @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; in fact it can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the isomorphism @xmath103 set up by the induced metric on @xmath13 , @xmath104 , and vol@xmath105 the riemannian volume form on @xmath13 induced by the ricci - flat metric .",
    "thus for lagrangians with @xmath106 , i.e. those for which re@xmath9 restricts to a nowhere vanishing volume form on @xmath13 and so are not too far from being slag ( @xmath107 ) , this gives a non - degenerate metric .",
    "the symplectic form is invariant under the group action , and formally the moment map is indeed @xmath108 in the dual @xmath109 of the lie algebra ( i.e. @xmath72-forms on @xmath13 with integral zero ) .",
    "this follows from the computation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a normal vector field to the lagrangian @xmath13 down which we compute the derivative of the hamiltonian @xmath112 for the infinitesimal action of @xmath83 . here",
    "have extended @xmath83 to a first - order neighbourhood of @xmath113 so that it is constant in the direction of @xmath111 .",
    "then the right hand side of the above equation is the pairing using the symplectic form of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , as required .",
    "infinitesimally we can see the moment map interpretation very easily , and fitting naturally with the mirror bundle point of view .",
    "deformations of holomorphic connections @xmath18 modulo complex gauge equivalence are given by a ker@xmath116/im@xmath116 first cohomology group , related to deformations ker@xmath117ker@xmath118 of the hym equations ( modulo _ unitary _ gauge transformations ) via hodge theory , with the moment map equation providing the @xmath119 slice to the imaginary part of the linearised group action .",
    "similarly , deformations of lagrangians are given by closed 1-forms ker@xmath120 , so that dividing by hamiltonian deformations we get @xmath121 if instead of dividing we impose the _ special _ condition , we get a ker@xmath122 slice @xmath123 to the ( imaginary ) deformations ( real deformations are given by changing the flat @xmath32 connection that can be incorporated into this ) .      to motivate a guess at the correct definition of stability for lagrangians ,",
    "we expand on an example of lawlor and joyce ( @xcite sections 6 and 7 , building on work of @xcite , @xcite ; see also a similar example in @xcite that is studied in @xcite ) , explaining its relevance to mirror symmetry , and giving a simple example in algebraic geometry that mirrors it .",
    "first define the pointwise phase @xmath124 of a submanifold @xmath13 : we may write @xmath125 where vol is the riemannian volume form on @xmath13 induced by yau s ricci - flat metric @xcite on @xmath3 .",

    "while each is monotonic in the other for small phase ( as @xmath169 ) , slope does not see orientation as phase does ; reversing orientation adds @xmath170 to the phase but leaves @xmath168 unchanged .",
    "this is related to the fact that we should really be working with complexes and so forth on the mirror side ( the bundle analogy is too narrow ) and changing orientation has no mirror analogue in terms of only stable bundles ; it corresponds to shifting ( complexes of ) bundles by one place in the derived category .",
    "while slopes of bundles can not go past infinity ( without moving degree in the derived category at least ) , for lagrangians they certainly can , and phase @xmath10 continues monotonically upwards as its slope @xmath171 becomes singular and then negative .",

    "thinking of @xmath232 as rotating through @xmath264 in figure 2 , it is at roughly @xmath265 that the phase inequality ( [ ineq ] ) gets violated , and the @xmath266 rotation of @xmath197 splits as a slag into the union of the @xmath266 rotations of @xmath267 and @xmath268 $ ] : these both have phase approximately zero .",
    "these phenomena are similar to wall - crossing in bundle theory on the complex side  in a real one - parameter family of khler forms , for fixed complex structure , stable holomorphic bundles for @xmath172 can become semistable at @xmath212 and unstable for @xmath174 .",
    "an example that mirrors joyce s is the following .",
    "suppose we have two stable bundles ( or coherent sheaves ) @xmath269 and @xmath270 with @xmath271 this is @xmath272 in the case of bundles and is the mirror @xcite of the one dimensional floer cohomology @xmath273 that is defined by the single intersection point of @xmath196 and @xmath197 ( see section [ ko ] for more details of this , and an explanation of why we are dealing with ext@xmath274 and @xmath275 here ) .",
    "we then form @xmath7 from this extension class @xmath276 take a family of khler forms @xmath277 such that @xmath278 is the same sign as @xmath145 ( here @xmath279rk@xmath280 is the slope of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath277 ) .",

    "@xmath270 is stable , for @xmath145 sufficiently small there are no subsheaves of @xmath270 of slope greater than @xmath286 , so for any stable destabilising subsheaf @xmath44 of @xmath7 , the composition @xmath287 can not be an injection ( unless it is an isomorphism , but ( [ e ] ) does not split .",
    "so @xmath288 , and the quotient @xmath289 has slope @xmath290 by the stability of @xmath44 and instability of @xmath7 .",
    "but @xmath291 injects into @xmath270 , which we know is impossible .    in the 2-dimensional case , by serre duality ext@xmath292ext@xmath293on @xmath87 or @xmath88 , so for @xmath174 we can instead form an extension @xmath294 to give a new bundle @xmath295 which is also stable , and has the same mukai vector @xmath296 compare ( [ + - ] ) . at @xmath212",
    "we take the ( polystable ) bundle @xmath297 this is because the semistable extension ( [ e ] ) no longer admits a hermitian - yang - mills metric , but @xmath298 does .",

    "for instance , taking the product of a single lagrangian curve @xmath196 in @xmath0 with a ( graded ) connect sum @xmath341 in another @xmath0 , we get a lagrangian @xmath342 in @xmath88 which is some kind of extension of the lagrangians @xmath343 and @xmath344 in @xmath88 . supposing that the @xmath204s are mirror to some ( complexes of ) sheaves @xmath281 , and that the connect sum @xmath341 is mirror to an extension represented by an element @xmath345ext@xmath346 .",
    "then by the knneth formula for sheaf cohomology , we see that @xmath342 is indeed mirror to an extension @xmath347 and so this sort of relative connect sum ( which is not @xmath203 on @xmath88 : @xmath343 and @xmath344 do not intersect transversely ) should also be considered .",
    "so we consider lagrangians @xmath348 intersecting _ cleanly _ ( see e.g. @xcite definition 2.1 ) , that is @xmath349 is a smooth submanifold , and @xmath350 .",
    "basic results of weinstein allow us to identify a neighbourhood of @xmath351 with a neighbourhood of the zero section @xmath351 in @xmath352 , where the total space of @xmath353 has its canonical symplectic structure , and @xmath354 is the annihilator , under the symplectic form , of @xmath355 ( to which the symplectic form therefore descends , making @xmath7 a symplectic bundle ) .    choosing a metric on @xmath7 , compatible with its symplectic structure , such that its transverse subbundles @xmath356",
    "are orthogonal , we can now perform the family connect sum of these , over the base @xmath351 , since the local model in @xcite is @xmath357 invariant .",
    "as before we insist that this can be compatibly graded again denote it by @xmath203 ; given a grading on @xmath196 there will be at most one grading on @xmath197 such that this graded relative connect sum exists .",
    "it should be noted that although such a clean intersection could be hamiltonian isotoped to be transverse , the resulting intersection points would not necessarily all be of floer / maslov index one , and so the pointwise graded connect sum could not be formed at every point ; we would end up with an immersed lagrangian . studying which immersed lagrangians",
    "should be included in the fukaya category , and which embedded lagrangians they should be considered equivalent to , is an important part of mirror symmetry and will need to be better understood to refine our conjecture . for instance",
    "forming extensions of bundles which also have nonzero homorphisms between them would appear to be mirror to forming connect sums between graded lagrangians at index one intersection points , leaving the index zero intersection points immersed .",
    "in general one would like to consider two objects of the fukaya category to be equivalent if their floer cohomologies with any other objects are the same .",
    "this would include hamiltonian deformation equivalence , but also more exotic equivalences for immersed lagrangians ( thanks to paul seidel for pointing this out to me ) . a start in understanding",
    "the floer cohomology of immersed lagrangians is @xcite ; in the present paper we are largely ignoring singularities .",
    "take graded lagrangians @xmath358 and @xmath359 , hamiltonian isotoped to intersect cleanly , and such that the graded ( relative ) lagrangian connect sums @xmath360 exist as above .",
    "then a lagrangian @xmath13 of maslov class zero is said to be destabilised by the @xmath204 if it is hamiltonian isotopic to such an @xmath202 , and the phases ( _ real _ numbers , induced by the gradings ) satisfy @xmath361 if @xmath13 is not destabilised by any such @xmath204 then it is called stable .",
    "@xmath362  : :    there is an obvious notion of a flux homomorphism for isotopies of    smooth lagrangians , taking a deformation to an element of    @xmath363 ( and linearising to give the usual    deformation theory of lagrangians ) .",
    "namely , take a deformation    @xmath364 through a vector field    @xmath365 $ ] to the one form    @xmath366    alternatively , the homomorphism takes a loop    @xmath367 , tracing out the 2-cycle    @xmath368)$ ] in @xmath3 under the    isotopy , to the real number    @xmath369}\\omega$ ] .",
    "( see chapter 10 of    @xcite for the analogous map for symplectomorphisms . )",
    "if the isotopy    @xmath370 is hamiltonian , the flux is zero ; the converse is    also easily proved using the methods of ( @xcite theorem 10.12 ) : we    may assume without loss of generality that the 1-form    @xmath371    is identically zero in @xmath37 .",
    "[ to see this , write    the 1-form as @xmath372 , and compose the deformation with    the time one map of the hamiltonian flow with vector field    @xmath373 ;    this does not alter the flux in @xmath363 or    the property of being hamiltonian . ] then let @xmath374 be    the closed 1-form on @xmath13 defined by    @xmath375    and let @xmath376 be the corresponding flow through time    @xmath145 .",
    "then the flow    @xmath377 is the corresponding    _ hamiltonian _ flow from @xmath378 to    @xmath379 ; see @xcite .",
    "+    thus it is not too hard to check if two lagrangians are hamiltonian    deformations of each other , at least through smooth lagrangians , if we    know they are deformations of each other as lagrangians .",
    "this second    condition , however , is harder to test , as the results of @xcite    demonstrate .",
    "@xmath362  : :    as mentioned in the last section , holomorphic discs are crucial in    both mirror symmetry and floer cohomology ; thus one should perhaps    restrict attention in the above definition to those lagrangians whose    floer cohomology is defined @xcite ,  @xmath362  : :    as pointed out to me by conan leung , this definition and the resulting    conjecture below may only be reasonable close to the large complex    structure limit point where the mirror symmetric arguments used to    motivate the conjecture are most valid .    a lagrangian of maslov class zero has a special lagrangian in its hamiltonian deformation class if and only if it is stable , and this slag representative is unique .",
    "again , we have been vague about singularities : which we allow , and what hamiltonian deformation equivalence would mean for them",
    ". we might also want to restrict attention to those lagrangians whose floer cohomology exists @xcite , and whose oh spectral sequence @xmath380 @xcite degenerates ; this will be discussed more in @xcite .",
    "we might also want to restrict to lagrangians whose phase function varies only by a certain bounded amount ; in the example worked out in @xcite this is required .",
    "in @xcite it is shown there that the gradient of the norm - squared @xmath381 of the moment map can be taken to be the mean curvature vector of the lagrangian , so mean curvature flow ( which is hamiltonian for maslov class zero ) should converge to this slag representative if the lagrangian is stable and the phase satisfies certain bounds .",
    "everything works rather simply on @xmath0 ; grayson @xcite , building on work of gage , hamilton and others ( e.g. @xcite ) , has shown that mean curvature flow for curves ( of maslov class zero ) converges to straight lines and so we get the mirror symmetric analogue of atiyah s classification @xcite of sheaves on an elliptic curve ",
    "they are basically all sums of stable sheaves .",
    "the only exceptions are the non - trivial extensions of certain sheaves by themselves ; these correspond to thickenings of the corresponding special lagrangian ( giving fat slags , as they are known in britain , or multiply - wrapped cycles in physics speak ) .",
    "we give an example to demonstrate why one can not form smooth _ unstable _",
    "lagrangians on @xmath0 in figure 3 .",
    "first , giving @xmath196 and @xmath197 the gradings such that their phases are 0 and @xmath382 , we expect @xmath202 to be stable , and indeed we see it is hamiltonian deformation equivalent to the slope @xmath383 slag mirror to the stable extension @xmath7 of @xmath384 by @xmath385 ( where @xmath386 is a basepoint of @xmath0 with corresponding line bundle mirror to the diagonal slag drawn ) .    if one then tries to form an unstable slag @xmath209 , the _ graded _",
    "connect sum does not exist  the phase would become discontinuous . to form @xmath209 we see from the diagram that we have to take the phase of @xmath196 to be @xmath126 , thus reversing its orientation , and in fact forming @xmath387)$ ] . then the stability inequality ( [ ineq ] ) is not violated , and in fact this lagrangian is stable and hamiltonian deformation equivalent to the slag in @xmath0 represented by the vertical edge of the square ( and so drawn with a little artistic license in figure 3 ) . under the mirror map this corresponds to replacing the extension ext@xmath274 class by a hom ( as we have shifted complexes of sheaves by one place ) and taking the cone of this in the derived category ; this is the cokernel @xmath388 of figure 3 .",
    "as pointed out to me by markarian and polishchuk , one can play with lots of pictures of connect sums on tori to recover descriptions of certain moduli of sheaves , their special cycles ( for instance where one connect - sum neck parameter goes to zero ) , and so forth , giving results similar to some of those in @xcite .",
    "this example can be extended to show that we can not form the graded connect sum @xmath202 of any two lagrangians ( via a class in @xmath389 ) if @xmath390 .",
    "namely , replace @xmath196 and @xmath197 by their hamiltonian deformation equivalent slag representatives , which are straight lines of constant phase @xmath391 .",
    "as figure 3 shows , @xmath202 can be compatibly graded about an intersection point if and only if we have the local inequalities @xmath392 thus we require @xmath393 .",
    "( we will explain this kind of phenomenon more generally in @xcite in terms of the grading on floer cohomology . )",
    "each intersection point is floer coclosed since the floer grading is the same as the relative orientation of the lagrangians , mod 2 , and this is the same at each intersection point of the straight lines .",
    "so each possible connect sum of the slags defines a class in @xmath316 , and any other connect sum , defined on hamiltonian deformations of @xmath196 and @xmath197 by a class in @xmath316 , will be hamiltonian deformation equivalent to the appropriate connect sum of the slags , and so satisfy the same phase inequality .",
    "if two smooth lagrangians have the same phase then their representative slags will either be the same or disjoint parallel slags .",
    "either way there are no connect sums ( though as mentioned above to account for the mirror symmetry of bundles one should also include non - trivial thickenings of slags in the fukaya category ) .",
    "thus complex dimension 1 is too simple  in trying to make the phase of one lagrangian become larger than the phase of another , the two must cross , thus reversing their relative orientations and changing the order of the connect sum .",
    "far more complicated phenomena arise in 2 and 3 dimensions , however .",
