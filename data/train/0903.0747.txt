    "one of the main reasons to build the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is the determination of the mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . in the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics and its extensions incorporating supersymmetry ( susy )",
    ", ewsb occurs through the higgs mechanism , which in turn leads to the existence of one or more higgs particles .    within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a realisation of susy with minimal particle content and gauge structure ,",
    "the higgs potential conserves charge & parity ( cp ) at tree level @xcite . beyond the trivial order",
    ", several studies have shown that cp invariance of the higgs potential may in principle be broken by radiative corrections @xcite , as the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets can develop a relative phase @xcite .",
    "this type of cp violation is generally referred to as spontaneous cp violation and it requires a light higgs state as a result of the georgi - pais theorem @xcite , but the possibility of the latter has now essentially been ruled out by experiment @xcite@xcite .",
    "cp violation can also be explicitly induced in the mssm , in much the same way as it is done in the sm , by complex yukawa couplings of the higgs bosons to sfermions .",
    "there are several new parameters in the susy theory , that are absent in the sm , which could well be complex and thus possess cp - violating phases . however , the cp - violating phases associated with the sfermions of the first and , to a lesser extent , second generations are severely constrained by bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , neutron and muon . nonetheless , there have been several suggestions @xcite@xcite to evade these constraints without suppressing the cp - violating phases .    by building on the results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( for the production ) and @xcite@xcite ( for the decay )  see also refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite  we will look here at the lhc phenomenology of the @xmath0 process ( where @xmath1 labels the lightest neutral higgs state of the cp - violating mssm ) , which involves the ( leading ) direct effects of cp violation through couplings of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 corresponding to the three neutral higgs bosons ) to sparticles in the loops as well as the ( sub - leading ) indirect effects through scalar - pseudoscalar mixing yielding the cp - mixed state @xmath3 . ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some preliminary accounts in this respect . ) all sources of cp violation are reviewed in the next section , where we also lay down our nomenclature and conventions . in the following section we present our results ,",
    "then we conclude .",
    "explicit cp violation arises in the higgs sector of the mssm when various related couplings become complex .",
    "one consequence is that the physical higgs bosons are no more cp eigenstates , but a mixture of these @xcite@xcite .",
    "one may then look at the production and decay of the lightest of the physical higgs particles , hereafter labeled @xmath1 .",
    "cp - violating effects in the combined production and decay process enter through complex @xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath6 couplings at production and decay level plus mixing in the propagator ( @xmath5 represents a sfermion ) .",
    "the nature of these couplings are presented in the appendix .",
    "the leading contribution to higgs production in gluon fusion is at the one - loop level .",
    "similarly , higgs decay into a photon pair also occurs at one - loop level .",
    "these loops contain besides sm and charged higgs states also supersymmetric particles ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the case of production while also @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the case of decay ) where the phases of the susy parameters enter . hence cp - conserving and cp - violating effects enter at",
    "_ the same perturbative order _ in the cross section for @xmath11 , so that the latter is an ideal laboratory to pursue studies of the complex ( or otherwise ) nature of the soft susy breaking parameters concerned .",
    "in contrast , notice that cp - violating effects through mixing in the propagator enter only at higher order , through self - energies , as there is already a tree - level cp - conserving contribution to the propagator ( and @xmath12 ) mass is subject to similar loop effects , though @xcite has already shown that the consequent effects are marginal ( see the left - hand side of fig . 4 therein ) ,",
    "so that they are included here but not dwelt upon for long . ] .",
    "the dynamics of cp - violating effects in the production and decay stages are rather similar , given that the same diagrammatic topologies are involved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] ) , in particular , as shown in our previous work @xcite@xcite , we expect a strong impact of a light stop quark in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "the propagator is considered in the following way .",
    "a higgs particle , @xmath3 , produced through gluon fusion , can be converted into another mass eigenstate , @xmath13 , through interaction of fermion or gauge boson loops and their supersymmetric counterparts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the following , when talking about results for the @xmath1 , we consider the production of any of @xmath14 , which , while propagating , converts into @xmath1 . on the one hand , the proper procedure would be to sum over all three higgs bosons , both in production and decay , and then integrate over an appropriate @xmath15 invariant mass bin , the size of which should be determined by the experimental di - photon mass resolution . on the other hand , in the regions of parameter space that we will cover with this study",
    "it is rarely the case that two ( or more ) higgs boson masses are close together ( within the resolution ) , i.e. , degenerate , where truly cp violating effects at one - loop level can be large @xcite .",
    "in fact , in most of the parameter space volume considered , an _ isolated _",
    "@xmath1 resonance can be seen by experiment , resolved at the level of about 2 gev ( which is roughly the di - photon mass resolution in atlas @xcite , while in cms it is somewhat better @xcite ) , so that we can treat the decay of the @xmath1 separately .",
    "however , whenever this is not possible , because @xmath16 gev , we consider all the degenerate higgs particles together , as explained in section 3 .",
    "as intimated , the propagator matrix is obtained from the self - energy of the higgs particles computed at one - loop level , where we used the expressions provided by @xcite , which include off - diagonal absorptive parts .",
    "the matrix inversion required is done numerically using the lapack package @xcite .",
    "all relevant couplings and masses are obtained from cpsuperh version 2 @xcite , which takes into account all applicable experimental constraints including the low energy edms .",
    "the cross section of the full process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] is computed numerically .",
    "the multi - dimensional integration is carried out using the cuhre program under the cuba package @xcite . for our collider analysis",
    "we have used the cteq6 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite@xcite computed at the factorisation / renormalisation scale @xmath17 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the results obtained here can not be simply extracted from existing programs , as these account for cp - violating effects in production and decay separately , hence without interconnecting them through the appropriately mixed ( and off - shell ) propagators . concerning the latter , we are aware that the inclusion of off - shell higgs propagators in the diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : feyn ] introduces gauge - violating effects , though it should be appreciated that these are at most of order @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total width of the higgs state @xmath3 ( @xmath20 ) . for the mass regimes we are interested in here , particularly for the case @xmath21 , such gauge - violating effects are negligible compared to the typical cp - violating ones that we will illustrate in the remainder of the paper",
    "in order to illustrate the typical effects of cp violation in the mssm , we have considered a few sample parameter space points and studied the effect of , in particular , light sparticles in the loops , chiefly , of top squarks .",
    "we fix the following mssm parameters which play only a minor role in cp violation studies for higgs production and decay : + @xmath22 + we consider the case of all the third generation trilinear couplings being unified into one single quantity , @xmath23 .",
    "all the soft masses are taken to be the same at some unification scale , whose representative value adopted here is 1 tev . when considering the light stop case we take a comparatively light value for @xmath24 gev , which corresponds to a stop mass of around 200 gev , otherwise @xmath25 is set to 1 tev .",
    "we could , alternatively , consider small values for @xmath26 to reach light squarks , but the effects would qualitatively be the same .",
    "so , in the following we keep a fixed value of @xmath27 tev . in the higgs scalar - pseudoscalar mixing the product of @xmath28 is relevant rather than @xmath29 or @xmath23 separately .",
    "as argued in our earlier works , the only phase that is relevant is thus the sum of the phases of @xmath29 and @xmath23 . in our analysis",
    "we have kept @xmath30 and studied the effect of cp violation by varying @xmath31 . regarding the absolute values of @xmath29 or @xmath23 , in our numerical analysis , we have varied these parameters between 1 and 1.5 tev .",
    "@xmath32 is instead varied between 100 and 300 gev .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs particle is consequently in the range of 50130 gev .",
    "we then analyse cases with different @xmath33 s .",
    "in particular , low @xmath33 values give very small deviations from the corresponding cp - conserving cases , while large @xmath33 values produce significant differences .",
    "also , we take a representative value of @xmath34 to see the effect of the other parameters . in addition , to illustrate the cases of very large @xmath33 points , we present the analysis with @xmath35 whilst keeping all other parameters constant .    the main aim of this article is to understand the effect of sparticle couplings in the cp - violating mssm . as mentioned earlier , effects of cp violation",
    "enter the process considered and combine in three different ways , viz .",
    "( i ) physical higgs particles are a mixture of the cp eigenstates , ( ii ) through the sparticle - higgs couplings in the production and decay amplitudes , ( iii ) through the higgs mixing in the propagator .",
    "notice though that ( i ) ( and also ( iii ) to some extent ) is a result of ( ii ) , however , in our specific process , ( i)(iii ) all enter giving ( quantitatively and qualitatively ) different effects , so we have listed them separately . as explained in the introduction , effects of ( i ) and ( ii ) in the case of @xmath36 production and @xmath37 decay were already reported on in detail in previous literature , albeit separately , so our intent here is to combine them .",
    "furthermore , we would like to explore the effects due to ( iii ) in our specific process following the general analysis of ref .",

    ", one can appreciate that the cp - conserving case of @xmath42 does not present any @xmath38 point significantly degenerate with either @xmath43 or @xmath44 for the entire range of @xmath45 gev considered , as the mass difference @xmath46 is always larger than 2 gev .",
    "in fact , in all the cases we considered , in the cp - conserving case @xmath1 , which is the lightest of the physical higgs particles , is a pseudoscalar at low @xmath32 values , which turns to a scalar at large @xmath32 values .",

    "[ fig : prop ] shows the typical effects of cp violation on the cross section through the propagator . in order to understand the latter , we analyse the @xmath1 production , propagation and decay process in the following way .",

    ", we plot the contribution due to the diagonal elements in the propagator matrix and the contribution due to the off - diagonal elements separately , along with the total contribution .",
    "the off - diagonal cp - violating terms contribute around 1% near the degenerate mass region ( @xmath52 gev ) and much less when the higgs masses are distinguishably different .",
    "this effect is seen in all the parameter space points considered in fact , therefore , it is a general feature of the process .    in the degenerate region , where two higgs bosons are indistinguishable",
    ", their contributions to the total cross section will have to be added at the amplitude level , and the effect is expected to be distinct from the case of narrow width approximation ( nwa ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bw ] ( left ) we plot the cross section of our process for the two cases in the three situations with @xmath42 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , keeping all other parameters fixed . in this particular case ,",

    "[ fig : bw ] ( right ) we plot the percentage deviation of cross section from its value obtained in the nwa , defined as @xmath56 the deviation is between 10 to 30% for @xmath57 , thereby confirming that a production times decay calculation in nwa , neglecting amplitude level superposition in the degenerate case , would lead here to somewhat incorrect results .",
    "such large difference is not expected to arise from higher order corrections .    in summary , we would like to point out that it was _ a priori _ not obvious what the effect of propagator mixing would have been , how cp - violating effects in production and decay canceled or supported each other and how the proper accounting for the degenerate mass cases would have impacted the final results .",
    "our analysis makes it clear though that , while the propagator mixing does not affect the considered process in a significant way , the other two work in tandem to make the overall effect significant .",
    "while this statement has been illustrated for some sample parameter space points , we have verified that the above conclusions remain the same for parameter regions with large values of @xmath33 , @xmath29 and @xmath23 , where the cp - violating effects are prominent . finally , as fig .",
    "[ fig : bw ] incorporates cp - violating effects due to the change in the higgs couplings with supersymmetric particles , it is clear that it is the latter which accounts for essentially all the differences between the cp - conserving and cp - violating results , throughout . in this connection , it is of particular importance to investigate the effect of the ( dominant ) higgs - stop - stop couplings with varying stop mass , as illustrated in the discussion below .    in fig .",

    "there is appreciable variation of the cross section with @xmath31 . comparing the two cases of light and heavy stops ,",

    "we may note that the couplings @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hisfsf ] ) , as well as other higgs couplings , have complicated relations with various susy parameters , and therefore it is difficult to understand all the features of the cross section in full detail .",
    "nonetheless we have attempted doing so .",
    "we can certainly say that the minimum in the cross section plots ( figs .",
    "48 ) corresponds to the cross - over region in fig .",
    "2 . besides , in all plots presented , the cross section rises ( the more the larger @xmath65 , so long that it is above 145 gev or so ) with @xmath31 except in the right plot of fig . 6 ( similarly to the top - right frame of fig . 11 in @xcite ) and this can be traced back to the shape of the @xmath64 coupling itself .",
    "in fact , we generally recover in the case of the full process @xmath66 the trends already seen in ref .",
    "@xcite for the di - photon decay alone , signifying that cp - violating effects at production level are not offsetting those affecting the decay ( as those induced by propagation are negligible ) , in fact both are at times cooperating to enhance the overall corrections .",
    "also , one can often appreciate sudden variations in the di - photon yield due to indirect width effects .",
    "for example , the small hump observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb20a1mu1.5phimu ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : tb50a1mu1phimu ] for @xmath67 around @xmath68 gev is an indirect effect on the @xmath69 due to a dip in the total width of @xmath1 corresponding to these parameter values .",
    "the dip in the total width itself arises because @xmath1 is purely @xmath70 type around here , and therefore , does not couple to the charged leptons and bottom quarks .",
    "furthermore , it should also be recalled that a common feature to all graphs is that the @xmath1 is mostly cp - mixed for small @xmath65 values but after the cross over around @xmath71 gev it is mostly cp - even ( see fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this also impinging on the shape of the overall cross section . finally , while in many cases the entire allowed range of the cross section can be spanned by simply considering both signs of @xmath29 ( the two cp - conserving limits , @xmath42 and @xmath72 ) , where the results for cp - violating scenarios lie between these two cases , in many of the instances studied , owing to the structure of the cp - violating couplings between squark and higgs states ( which involve two terms with , at times , contrasting signs ) , this is generally not the case when @xmath73 gev and also in some instances when @xmath74 gev ( see , e.g. , the right hand side of fig",
    ".  6 ) .",
    "in addition to the stop mass dependence of the @xmath66 cross section , we have also studied how the latter varies with the masses of the other ( s)particles entering the loops .",
    "however , in line with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite for the case of the @xmath75 decay , we have found that their impact is largely negligible here too , no matter the value of the cp - violating phases .",
    "nonetheless , one last aspect ought to be explored in connection with the @xmath76 dependence : how the value of the latter is itself affected by the cp - violating phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stopmass ] we plot the variation of the lightest stop mass with the phase of @xmath29 for different parameter space points considered in the earlier plots .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 , when @xmath61 tev and @xmath58 tev , the mass @xmath76 lies within @xmath77 of its average value whereas , for @xmath39 tev and @xmath40 tev , it lies within @xmath78 of it . for @xmath35",
    "the spread is even narrower ( @xmath79 ) while for @xmath80 it is larger ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "notice though that these variations are typically smaller than the experimental resolution expected at the lhc in measuring @xmath76 , which are of order 20% or so @xcite .",
    "therefore , an intriguing prospect appears , that the discovery of a light mssm higgs boson ( with mass below 130 gev or so ) at the lhc may eventually enable one to disentangle the cp - violating case from the cp - conserving one , so long that the relevant susy parameters entering @xmath82 are measured in the same process or elsewhere , in particular @xmath38 ( or alternatively @xmath65 , recall our fig . 2 here and/or see ref .",
    "@xcite for the relation between the two ) and @xmath76 .",
    "this is not phenomenologically inconceivable , as , on the one hand , the @xmath15 final state is ideally suited to measure the higgs mass ( or indeed resolve superpositions of higgs states ) given the high di - photon mass resolution , and , on the other hand , this higgs detection mode requires a very high luminosity , unlike the discovery of those sparticles ( and the measurement of their masses and couplings ) that enter the loops , chiefly top squarks .",
    "finally , notice that it is from this point of view that we decided to neglect studying here the impact of both reducible and irreducible backgrounds onto our signal process .",
    "( the former typically include @xmath83  jet and di - jet production , with jets mis - tagged as photons , whereas the latter involve the tree - level @xmath84 and one - loop @xmath85 [ via box diagrams involving quarks and squarks ] subprocesses . ) on the one hand , any cp - violating effect proportional to squark flavour mixing mass terms coming from non - resonant diagrams , such as the gluon - gluon - gamma - gamma box diagram , is expected to be very small owing to the stringent experimental constraints on rare cp and flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "on the other hand , since the background processes including cp - violating effects at higher order do not produce any kinematic structure around the presumed @xmath1 resonance , they can accurately be measured off peak and smoothly interpolated beneath it .",
    "we have shown the conspicuous effects of cp violation onto the lhc cross section for @xmath2 in the mssm , as the overall production and decay rate varies over an order or so of magnitude , depending on the value of @xmath31 ( or , alternatively , @xmath86 ) .",
    "varying the mass of the top squark from about 1 tev to around 250 gev has also a strong quantitative impact on the cross section , possibly changing its dependence on the phases also qualitatively .",
    "in fact , a significant dependence of the overall cross section on @xmath31 when @xmath1 is not a cp - mixed state ( as seen from all the figures presented for large @xmath65 values ) clearly exemplifies the importance of the higgs - stop - stop coupling when cp violation is considered .",
    "altogether then , it is clear that the prime detection channel of a light mssm higgs boson at the lhc is also a prime candidate to prove the existence of explicit cp violation in minimal susy .",
    "in fact , the @xmath31 dependence of our results is strongest when the cross section is away from the minima , typically for @xmath65 larger than 150 gev or so .",
