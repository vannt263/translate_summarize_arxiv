    "<S> the phase transition between the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) and nematic phases , the so - called deconfined criticality , was investigated for the quantum @xmath0-spin model on the spatially anisotropic triangular lattice with the biquadratic interaction by means of the numerical diagonalization method . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated both vbs- and nematic - order parameters , aiming to clarify the nature of this transition from complementary viewpoints . </S>",
    "<S> simulating the clusters with @xmath1 spins , we estimate the correlation - length critical exponent as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated fisher s exponent ( anomalous dimension ) for each order parameter .    </S>",
