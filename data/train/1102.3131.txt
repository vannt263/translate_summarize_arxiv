    "the dynamical structure of the kuiper belt suggests that the outer solar system experienced a phase of planetesimal - driven migration in its early history  @xcite .",
    "pluto and other kuiper belt objects that are trapped in mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with neptune are explained by the outward migration of neptune due to interactions with a more massive primordial planetesimal disk in the outer regions of the solar system  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the so - called the scattered disk of the kuiper belt can also be explained by the outward migration of neptune  @xcite , or by the effects of a high eccentricity phase of ice giant planet evolution during the outward migration of neptune  @xcite .",
    "the basic premise of planetesimal - driven migration is that the giant planets formed in a more compact configuration than we find them today , and that they were surrounded by a massive ( @xmath9 ) disk of unaccreted icy planetesimals that was the progenitor of the currently observed kuiper belt  @xcite .",
    "when planetesimals are preferentially scattered either inward ( toward the sun ) or outward ( away from the sun ) , net orbital angular momentum is transferred between the disk and the large body , causing a drift in the large body s semimajor axis  @xcite . in many simulations of giant planet migration",
    ", icy planetesimals are preferentially scattered inward by each of the three outer giant planets ( saturn , uranus , and neptune ) causing these planets to migrate outward . due to jupiter s large mass , planetesimals that encounter jupiter",
    "are preferentially ejected out of the solar system , leading to a net loss of mass from the solar system and an inward migration of jupiter .",
    "planetesimal - driven giant planet migration has been suggested as a cause of the late heavy bombardment ( lhb )  @xcite , however the link between these two events has yet to be definitively established  @xcite .",
    "such migration would have enhanced the impact flux of both asteroids and comets onto the terrestrial planets in two ways .",
    "first , many of the icy planetesimals scattered by the giant planets would have crossed the orbits of the terrestrial planets .",
    "second , as the giant planets migrated , locations of mean motion and secular resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt , raising the eccentricities of asteroids to planet - crossing values .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the patterns of depletion observed in the asteroid belt are consistent with the effects of sweeping of resonances during the migration of the giant planets .",
    "the jupiter - facing sides of some of the kirkwood gaps ( regions of the asteroid belt that are nearly empty due to strong jovian mean motion resonances ) are depleted relative to the sun - facing sides , as would be expected due to the inward migration of jupiter and the associated inward sweeping of the jovian mean motion resonances .",
    "the region within the inner asteroid belt between semimajor axis range @xmath2@xmath10 also has excess depletion relative to a model asteroid belt that was uniformly populated and then subsequently sculpted by the gravitational perturbations of the planets over @xmath11 , as would be expected due to the outward migration of saturn and the associated inward sweeping of a strong secular resonance , the so - called @xmath0 resonance , as explained below . in our 2009 study , we concluded that the semimajor axis distribution of asteroids in the main belt is consistent with the inward migration of jupiter and outward migration of saturn by amounts proposed in previous studies based on the kuiper belt resonance structure(e.g .",
    ",   * ? ? ?",
    "however , in that study the migration timescale was not strongly constrained , because only the relative depletion of asteroids in nearby semimajor axis bins could be determined , not their overall level of depletion . in the present paper , we explore in more detail the effect that planet migration would have had on the asteroid belt due to asteroid eccentricity excitation by the sweeping of the @xmath0 secular resonance . from the observed eccentricity distribution of main belt asteroids",
    ", we find that it is possible to derive constraints on the secular resonance sweeping timescale , and hence on the migration timescale .",
    "secular resonances play an important role in the evolution of the main asteroid belt .",
    "the inner edge of the belt nearly coincides with the @xmath0 secular resonance which is defined by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the rate of precession of the longitude of pericenter , @xmath14 , of an asteroid and @xmath15 is the sixth eigenfrequency of the solar system planets ( approximately the rate of precession of saturn s longitude of pericenter ) .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance , is important for the delivery of near earth asteroids ( neas ) to the inner solar system  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the location of the @xmath0 resonance actually forms surfaces in @xmath16 space , and @xcite showed that those surfaces approximately define the  inner edge \" of the main asteroid belt .",
    "however , as mentioned above , @xcite found that , with the planets in their present configuration , planetary perturbations over the age of the solar system can not fully account for the detailed orbital distribution of the asteroids in the inner asteroid belt .",
    "the pattern of excess depletion in inner asteroid belt noted by @xcite is consistent with the effect of the inward sweeping of the @xmath0 secular resonance . in general , the direction of motion of the @xmath0 is anticorrelated with that of saturn , so an inward sweeping of the @xmath0 would be produced by an outwardly migrating saturn .",
    "sweeping , or scanning , secular resonances have been analyzed in a number of previous works .",
    "sweeping secular resonances due to the changing quadrupole moment of the sun during solar spin - down have been explored as a possible mechanism for explaining the eccentricity and inclination of mercury  @xcite .",
    "secular resonance sweeping due to the effects of the dissipating solar nebula just after planet formation has also been investigated as a possible mechanism for exciting the orbital eccentricities of mars and of the asteroid belt  @xcite .",
    "the dissipating massive gaseous solar nebula would have altered the secular frequencies of the solar system planets in a time - dependent way , causing locations of secular resonances to possibly sweep across the inner solar system , thereby exciting asteroids into the eccentric and inclined orbits that are observed today .",
    "this mechanism was revisited by @xcite , who incorporated a more sophisticated treatment of the nebular dispersal .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that the excitation ( and clearing ) of the primordial asteroid belt was unlikely due to secular resonance sweeping due to the dispersion of the solar nebula .",
    "the special case of asteroids on initially circular orbits being swept by the @xmath0 and @xmath17 resonances has been investigated by  @xcite . in this paper , we consider the more general case of non - zero initial eccentricities ; our analysis yields qualitatively new results and provides new insights into the dynamical history of the asteroid belt .",
    "this extends the work of @xcite and @xcite in developing analytical treatments of the effects of sweeping secular resonances on asteroid orbits . in doing so",
    ", we have developed an explicit relationship between the migration rate of the giant planets , the initial eccentricity of the asteroid and its initial longitude of perihelion , and the final eccentricity of the asteroid after the passage of the resonance .",
    "we show that for initially non - zero asteroid eccentricity , the sweeping of the @xmath0 resonances can either increase or decrease asteroid eccentricities .",
    "examining the orbits of observed main belt asteroids we find evidence for a double - peaked eccentricity distribution ; this supports the case for a history of @xmath0 sweeping .",
    "quantitative comparison of our analytical theory with the semimajor axis and eccentricity distribution of asteroids yields new constraints on the timescale of planet migration .",
    "we note that although our analysis is carried out in the specific context of the sweeping @xmath0 resonance during the phase of planetesimal - driven migration of jupiter and saturn , the techniques developed here may be extended to other similar problems , for example , the sweeping of the inclination - node @xmath17 resonance in the main asteroid belt , the @xmath18 secular resonance in the kuiper belt , and farther afield , the sweeping of secular resonances in circumstellar or other astrophysical disks .",
    "we adopt a simplified model in which a test particle ( asteroid ) is perturbed only by a single resonance , the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "we use a system of units where the mass is in solar masses , the semimajor axis is in units of au , and the unit of time is @xmath19y . with this choice , the gravitational constant , @xmath20 , is unity .",

    "are constant parameters in the hamiltonian given in equation  ( [ e : reshamiltonian ] ) . however ,",
    "during the epoch of giant planet migration , the planets semimajor axes change secularly with time , so that @xmath29 , @xmath39 and @xmath30 become time - dependent parameters . in the analysis",
    "below , we neglect the time - dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and adopt a simple prescription for the time - dependence of @xmath39 ( see equation  [ e : goft ] below ) .",
    "this approximation is physically motivated : the fractional variation of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for an individual asteroid is small compared to the effects of the  small divisor \" @xmath40 during the @xmath0 resonance sweeping event .",
    "it is useful to make a canonical transformation to new variables @xmath41 defined by the following generating function , @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the new hamiltonian function is @xmath45 , @xmath46 where we have retained @xmath28 to denote the canonical momentum , since @xmath47 .",

    "* ) . then , @xmath56 , and the equations of motion from the hamiltonian of equation  ( [ e : reshamiltonian3 ] ) can be written as : @xmath57 these equations of motion form a system of linear , nonhomogenous differential equations , whose solution is a linear combination of a homogeneous and a particular solution .",
    "the homogeneous solution can be found by inspection , giving : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constant coefficients .",
    "we use the method of variation of parameters to find the particular solution .",
    "accordingly , we replace the constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the homogeneous solution with functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , to seek the particular solution of the form @xmath63 substituting this into the equations of motion we now have : @xmath64 therefore @xmath65 equations  ( [ e : dota ] ) and ( [ e : dotb ] ) do not have a simple closed - form solution , but their solution can be expressed in terms of fresnel integrals  @xcite .",
    "the fresnel integrals are defined as follows : @xmath66 and have the following properties : @xmath67 therefore @xmath68    we denote initial conditions with a subscript @xmath69 , and write the solution to equations  ( [ e : dotxsweep ] ) and ( [ e : dotysweep ] ) as @xmath70+y_i\\sin\\left[\\lambda\\left(t^2-t_i^2\\right)\\right]\\notag\\\\           & \\qquad+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{|\\lambda|}}\\left[\\left(s - s_i\\right)\\cos\\lambda t^2-\\left(c - c_i\\right)\\sin\\lambda t^2\\right]\\label{e : xsoln},\\\\      y(t)&=-x_i\\sin\\left[\\lambda\\left(t^2-t_i^2\\right)\\right]+y_i\\cos\\left[\\lambda\\left(t^2-t_i^2\\right)\\right]\\notag\\\\           & \\qquad-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{|\\lambda|}}\\left[\\left(c - c_i\\right)\\cos\\lambda t^2+\\left(s - s_i\\right)\\sin\\lambda t^2\\right]\\label{e : ysoln}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the asteroid is swept over by the secular resonance at time @xmath54 , we can calculate the changes in @xmath71 by letting @xmath72 and evaluating the coefficients @xmath73 far from resonance passage , i.e. , for @xmath74 , by use of equation  ( [ e : fresnellimits ] ) .",

    "we also note that the magnitude of eccentricity change is inversely related to the speed of planet migration . in linear secular theory ( equation  ( [ e : reshamiltonian ] ) ) , eccentricity and inclination are decoupled , and therefore the effect of the sweeping @xmath0 does not depend on the inclination .",
    "however , as @xcite showed , the location of the @xmath0 does depend on inclination , but the dependence is weak for typical inclinations of main belt objects .",
    "nevertheless , there are populations of main belt asteroids at high inclination ( such as the hungaria and phocaea families ) , and an analysis of secular resonance sweeping that incorporates coupling between eccentricity and inclination would be valuable for understanding the effects of planet migration on these populations ; we leave this to a future investigation .    for small @xmath26",
    ", we can use the approximation @xmath80 .",
    "considering all possible values of @xmath81 , an asteroid with initial eccentricity @xmath82 that is swept by the @xmath0 resonance will have a final eccentricity in the range @xmath83 to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86    equations  ( [ e : jf])([e : deltaedef ] ) have the following implications :    1 .",
    "initially circular orbits become eccentric , with a final eccentricity @xmath87 .",
    "an ensemble of orbits with the same @xmath25 and initial non - zero @xmath26 but uniform random orientations of pericenter are transformed into an ensemble that has eccentricities in the range @xmath83 to @xmath84 ; this range is not uniformly distributed because of the @xmath78 dependence in equation  ( [ e : jf ] ) , rather the distribution peaks at the extreme values ( see fig .",
    "[ f : tpideal ] below ) .",
    "an ensemble of asteroids having an initial distribution of eccentricities which is a single - peaked gaussian ( and random orientations of pericenter ) would be transformed into one with a double - peaked eccentricity distribution .",
    "in light of the above calculations , it is possible to conclude that if the asteroid belt were initially dynamically cold , that is asteroids were on nearly circular orbits prior to secular resonance sweeping , then the asteroids would be nearly uniformly excited to a narrow range of final eccentricities , the value of which would be determined by the rate of resonance sweeping . because asteroids having eccentricities above planet - crossing values would be unlikely to survive to the present day , it follows that an initially cold asteroid belt which is uniformly excited by the @xmath0 sweeping will either lose all its asteroids or none . on the other hand , an initially excited asteroid belt ,",
    "that is a belt with asteroids that had non - zero eccentricities prior to the @xmath0 sweeping , would have asteroids final eccentricities bounded by equation  ( [ e : finalebounds ] ) , allowing for partial depletion and also broadening of its eccentricity distribution . in this section",
    ", we apply our theoretical analysis to the problem of the @xmath0 resonance sweeping through the asteroid belt , and compare the theoretical predictions with the observed eccentricity distribution of asteroids .      in order to apply the theory",
    ", we must find the location of the @xmath0 resonance as a function of the semimajor axes of the giant planets orbits , and also obtain values for the parameter @xmath30 ( equation  [ e : epsdef ] ) , for asteroids with semimajor axis values in the main asteroid belt .",
    "the location of the @xmath0 resonance is defined as the semimajor axis , @xmath88 , where the rate , @xmath29 ( equation  [ e : g0def ] ) , of pericenter precession of a massless particle ( or asteroid ) is equal to the @xmath15 eigenfrequency of the solar system . in the current solar system ,",
    "the @xmath15 frequency is associated with the secular mode with the most power in saturn s eccentricity  pericenter variations . during the epoch of planetesimal - driven planet migration ,",
    "jupiter migrated by only a small amount but saturn likely migrated significantly more  @xcite , so we expect that the variation in location of the @xmath0 secular resonance is most sensitive to saturn s semimajor axis .",
    "we therefore adopt a simple model of planet migration in which jupiter is fixed at @xmath89 and only saturn migrates .",
    "we neglect the effects of the ice giants uranus and neptune , as well as secular effects due to the previously more massive kuiper belt and asteroid belt . with these simplifications ,",
    "the @xmath15 frequency varies with time as saturn migrates , so we parametrize @xmath15 as a function of saturn s semimajor axis .",
    "in contrast with the variation of @xmath15 , there is little variation of the asteroid s apsidal precession rate , @xmath29 , as saturn migrates .",
    "thus , finding @xmath88 is reduced to calculating the dependence of @xmath15 on saturn s semimajor axis .    to calculate @xmath15 as a function of saturn s semimajor axis",

    "the laplace - lagrange secular theory provides the secular frequencies and orbital element variations of the planets .",

    "the laplace - lagrance theory gives frequency values @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which are lower than the more accurate values given by @xcite by @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "@xcite achieved their more accurate solution by incorporating higher order terms in the disturbing function involving @xmath110 , which arise due to jupiter and saturn s proximity to the 5:2 resonance ( the so - called `` great inequality '' ) . by doing an accurate numerical analysis ( described below )",
    ", we found that the effect of the 5:2 resonance is only important over a very narrow range in saturn s semimajor axis .",
    "more significant is the perturbation owing to the 2:1 near - resonance of jupiter and saturn . @xcite",
    "developed corrections to the laplace - lagrange theory to account for the perturbations from @xmath111 resonances in the context of the uranian satellite system .",
    "applying that approach to our problem , we find that the 2:1 near - resonance between jupiter and saturn leads to zeroth order corrections to the elements of the @xmath94 matrix , where @xmath26 is eccentricity and @xmath93 is the order of the resonance . the 5:2 is a third order resonance , so its effect is @xmath112 .",
    "the 2:1 is a first order resonance , so that its effect does not depend on @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the discrepancy between linear theory and numerical analysis ( or the higher order theory of @xcite ) arising from the great inequality would be much less if jupiter and saturn were on more circular orbits , but the effect due to the 2:1 resonance would remain . ] . including these corrections",

    "not surprisingly , we find that the test particles in the full numerical integrations exhibit somewhat more complicated behavior than the perturbative approximation , and equation  ( [ e : finalebounds ] ) somewhat underpredicts the maximum final eccentricity : this may be due to higher order terms in the disturbing function that have been neglected in the perturbative analysis and which become more important at high eccentricity ; effects due to close encounters with jupiter also become important at the high eccentricities .",
    "does the eccentricity distribution of main belt asteroids retain features corresponding to the effects of the @xmath0 resonance sweeping ? to answer this question , we need to know the main belt eccentricity distribution free of observational bias , and also relatively free of the effects of @xmath141 of collisional evolution subsequent to the effects of planetary migration .",

    "thus , both solutions may be consistent with the observations , as post - sweeping dynamical erosion could result in a final eccentricity distribution resembling more closely the observed distribution .",
    "the estimates of saturn s migration rate quoted above depend strongly on the eccentricities of the giant planets during their migration .",

    "the @xmath0 resonance strength coefficient @xmath30 ( equation  [ e : epsdef ] ) is proportional to the amplitude of the @xmath123 mode , which is related to the eccentricities of the giant planets ( namely saturn and jupiter ) . from equation  ( [ e : hkvector ] ) , and the definition @xmath101 , the value of @xmath33 is a linear combination of the eccentricities of the giant planets . because saturn is the planet with the largest amplitude of the @xmath123 mode , from equation  ( [ e : jf ] ) the relationship between the sweep rate and the value of saturn s eccentricity is approximately @xmath180 .",

    "migration rates lower than @xmath1 would be inconsistent with the survival of any asteroids in the inner main belt , as the @xmath0 secular resonance would have excited asteroid eccentricities to planet - crossing values .",
    "this lower limit for the migration rate of saturn assumes that jupiter and saturn had their current orbital eccentricities ; the migration rate limit is inversely proportional to the square of the amplitude of the @xmath15 secular mode ; if jupiter and saturn s eccentricities were @xmath181 their current value ( i.e. , @xmath182 ) during the planet migration epoch , the limit on the migration rate decreases by a factor of @xmath185 .",

    "our analysis of secular resonance sweeping predicts that a single - peaked eccentricity distribution will be transformed into a double - peaked eccentricity by secular resonance sweeping .",

    "each of these solutions has very different implications for the primordial excitation and depletion of the main asteroid belt .",
    "the cold belt solution , with @xmath164 , would lead to little depletion of the asteroid belt during giant planet migration , as the @xmath0 resonance would be unable to raise eccentricities to mars - crossing values .",
    "this implies an initial dynamically quite cold asteroid belt with not more than @xmath188 times the mass of the current main belt ; the latter estimate comes from accounting for dynamical erosion over the age of the solar system  @xcite .",
    "the hot belt solution , with @xmath170 , would lead to loss of asteroids directly due to excitation of eccentricities above planet - crossing values , by about a factor of @xmath188 . in this case , the main asteroid belt was more dynamically excited prior to resonance sweeping than we find it today .",
    "this implies much greater loss of asteroids prior to @xmath0-sweeping , as the peak of the eccentricity distribution would be near the mars - crossing value , and subject to strong dynamical erosion  @xcite .",
    "each of these solutions has different implications for the model that the late heavy bombardment of the inner solar system is linked to the epoch of planetesimal - driven giant planet migration  @xcite .",
    "these implications will be explored in a future paper .",
    "we remind the reader that in order to elucidate the effects of @xmath0 resonance sweeping , we have made a number of simplifying assumptions to arrive at an analytically tractable model .",
    "these simplifications include neglecting the effects of planets other than jupiter and saturn , the effects of sweeping jovian mean motion resonances on asteroids , the effects of a presumed massive kuiper belt during the epoch of planet migration , and the self - gravity and collisional interactions of a previously more massive asteroid belt .",
    "in addition , our analysis was carried out in the planar approximation , thereby neglecting any eccentricity - inclination coupling effects .",
    "these neglected effects can be expected to reduce somewhat the lower limit on saturn s migration speed that we have derived , because in general they would reduce the effectiveness of the @xmath0 in exciting asteroid eccentricities .",
    "perhaps more importantly , giant planet migration would also lead to the sweeping of the main asteroid belt by the @xmath17 inclination secular resonance  @xcite whose effects could be used to infer additional constraints .",
    "recently , @xcite found through numerical simulations with slow rates of planet migration ( e - folding timescales exceeding 5 myr ) that the surviving asteroids in the main belt tend to be clumped around mean motion resonances .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution of survivors is found very different from the observed distribution for asteroids , and also that a large proportion of survivors have inclinations above 20@xmath189 , both inconsistent with the current main asteroid belt ; comparisons made with the unbiased main belt asteroid distributions as described in  @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the effects of the sweeping @xmath17 inclination - longitude of ascending node secular resonance , analogous to the sweeping @xmath0 eccentricity - pericenter secular resonance that we analyzed in the present study .",
    "while the effects of the sweeping @xmath17 resonance are analogous to the @xmath0 , only affecting inclinations instead of eccentricities , a full analysis of the asteroid belt inclinations is beyond the scope of the present work , but will be explored in a future study .",
    "a number of other studies have derived limits on the speed of planetesimal - driven giant planet migration .",
    "@xcite exclude an @xmath190folding migration timescale @xmath191 to @xmath192 confidence based on the lack of a large observed asymmetry in the population of kuiper belt objects in the two libration centers of the 2:1 neptune mean motion resonance . @xcite",
    "exclude @xmath193 based on the observed obliquity of saturn .",
    "the latter lower limit on the migration timescale is slightly incompatible with the lower limit on the rate of saturn s migration of @xmath194 we derive based on the existence of the inner asteroid belt .",
    "one way these can be reconciled is if saturn s orbital eccentricity were a factor @xmath188 smaller than its present value as it migrated from 8.5  au to 9.2  au ; then , some mechanism would need to have increased saturn s eccentricity up to its present value by the time saturn reached its present semimajor axis of @xmath195 .    the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewer and the editor eric feigelson for useful comments . this research was supported in part by nsf grant no .",
