    "understanding the smoothly embedded surfaces in a 4-manifold is intimately related to understanding the smooth structures on a 4-manifold .",
    "this is exhibited in , for example , the following two situations .",
    "first , any @xmath0 can represent by a smoothly embedded surface in @xmath1 , but the minimum genus of such a surface often depends on the particular smooth structure on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "second , understanding surfaces is important , because all smooth structures can be constructed via surgery along smooth structures .",
    "specifically , wall has shown in @xcite that every smooth structure on @xmath1 can be constructed via a series of spherical surgeries in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , iwase has shown that every smooth structure on @xmath1 can be obtained via a series of log transforms on tori , and inanc baykur and the author have given an independent proof in much the same spirit as wall ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , understanding all of the embedded surfaces in a 4-manifold is an intractable problem . not only is it already hard to classify embedded surfaces up to topological isotopy , but even within a given topological isotopy class there can be many distinct smooth embeddings .",
    "fintushel and stern have exhibited infinite families of surfaces which are topologically isotopic but smoothly distinct ( @xcite , see ruberman - kim @xcite for variations of this as well ) . however , to construct every smooth structure on a 4-manifold it _ not _ is necessary to consider surgery on every possible element of this great myriad of surfaces .",
    "very often surgery on one surface results in the same smooth structure as surgery on a different surface .",
    "the motivation for this paper is to partially make sense of this phenomenon by studying surfaces up to the equivalence of concordance .",
    "two surfaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 embedded in a 4-manifold @xmath1 are called concordant if there is an embedded 3-manifold @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "we will prove the following .",
    "let x be a simply connected manifold . then two smoothly ( resp .",
    "locally flat ) embedded surfaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 are smoothly ( resp .",
    "locally flat ) concordant if and only if they have the same genus and are in the same homology class",
    ".    we will apply our study of concordance to two questions , one smooth , and the other topological .",
    "the smooth question we investigate is the following : consider two concordant surfaces .",
    "is the set of manifolds obtained by surgery on one of the surfaces the same as the set of manifolds obtained by surgery on the other ? we define surgery along a surface as the process of removing a neighborhood of the surface and replacing it with something else . as @xmath7 for some 4-manifold @xmath8 and a diffeomorphism @xmath9 . ] in general , surgeries on different surfaces result in different manifolds , but in many cases it depends on the particular type of surgery .",
    "concordance would seem to be a natural context in which to investigate this question : by doing ( surgery@xmath10 ) along a concordance , we get a cobordism between surgery on one surface and surgery on another . for certain kinds of surgery",
    ", this is actually an h - cobordism .",
    "the failure of the h - cobordism prevents our us from concluding that surgeries on concordant surfaces must give diffeomorphic manifolds .    nevertheless , for certain types of concordance",
    ", we can say more .",
    "we call two genus-@xmath11 surfaces _ 0-concordant _ if there is a concordance @xmath12 such that the regular level sets @xmath13 consist of a surface of genus-@xmath11 and a disjoint collection of @xmath14 s",
    ". we will prove that the set of manifolds that arise via surgeries on 0-concordant surfaces are the same .    if ( surgery@xmath10 ) along a 0-concordance in @xmath15 results in a cobordism between simply connected 4-manifolds , then the cobordism is trivial , and the manifolds are diffeomorphic .",
    "the notion of 0-concordance was defined for spheres in paul melvin s thesis , where he shows that 0-concordant 2-knots in @xmath16 have diffeomorphic gluck twists .",
    "our theorem is a generalization of this , and we will further explain how it can be applied in section [ s : applications ] .",
    "the topological question we address is the following : when does the homology class and genus specify a surface up to isotopy ? based on the examples in @xcite , one could conjecture that such simple criteria are never sufficient in the smooth category .",
    "our focus here will be to understand when two surfaces are _ topologically _ isotopic",
    ".    if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are locally flat embedded surfaces surfaces of the same genus and homology class such that @xmath17 , then the two surfaces are topologically isotopic .    this has been known in the case that the @xmath18 are spheres for some time .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the condition that the complement of the surface must be simply connected is somewhat restrictive .",
    "it implies that the homology class of the surfaces must be primitive .",
    "if the homology class is not primitive , then the simplest possible fundamental group is a cyclic group ( whose order is the degree of the homology class ) . in this case",
    "we obtain :    let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be locally flat embedded surfaces of the same genus and homology class in a simply connected 4-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the surfaces are topologically isotopic when    * @xmath19 and @xmath20 or , * @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the genus of @xmath3 is strictly greater than the minimal genus for such a surface in its homology class ( minimal , that is , among surfaces with @xmath23 . )",
    "we prove this in section [ s : isotopy ] , where we will also state a formula from @xcite which specifies the minimal genus .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be smoothly embedded , 0-concordant surfaces in a 4-manifold @xmath1 . if @xmath17 , then @xmath24 is diffeomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "we will also prove counterparts for all of the above theorems in the non - simply connected case , but the conditions will be much greater , so we will defer them until later",
    ".    we will prove theorem [ t : main ] , on which all of our subsequent theorems are based , in section [ s : concordance ] . before that",
    ", this paper contains two technical sections concerning surgery on codimension-2 embeddings .",
    "specifically , section [ s : surgery1 ] will be particularly concerned with keeping track of fundamental groups , and section [ s : surgery2 ] will focus on the case of ambient dehn surgery on 3-manifolds in a 5-manifold ( with special emphasis on the importance of spin structures ) .",
    "we will construct concordances through a series of these kinds of ambient surgeries . with this outline in mind ,",
    "it is possible to skip straight to section [ s : concordance ] , the core of the paper , and refer back to the technical details as necessary .",
    "in some sense the most basic class of surfaces in 4-manifolds are the 2-knots in @xmath16 .",
    "we begin this section by recalling what is known about concordance , isotopy , and surgery involving 2-knots , and follow that up by explaining how the work of this paper generalizes this to surfaces in other simply connected 4-manifolds .    *",
    "concordance : unlike the case for classical knots in @xmath26 , all 2-knots were shown by kervaire to be concordant to the unknot , @xcite .",
    "we give a short proof of this in section [ ss : kerslice ] .",
    "* isotopy : freedman has shown that if @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is topologically the unknot .",

    "it is unknown whether the homotopy type of @xmath31 determines @xmath31 , even for ribbon knots . *",
    "surgery : there are two natural surgeries on a 2-knot .",
    "the first is spherical surgery , where we replace the neighborhood of the knot , @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "concordant spherical surgeries are often distinct : surgery on knots with distinct fundamental group , for example .",
    "the second is gluck twist , which we will concentrate on .",

    "] melvin asks the following :    are all 2-knots in @xmath16 0-concordant to the unknot ?    an affirmative answer to this question would imply that the gluck twist is a useless operation for constructing exotic @xmath16 s .      in this paper `` surgery",
    "'' will mean the process of removing the neighborhood of a surface ( or configuration of surfaces ) , and replacing it with something else .",
    "in addition to spherical modifications and gluck twists , we know of four more types of surface surgeries that have been useful in the study of 4-manifolds .    1 .",

    "fiber sums : take two manifolds @xmath45 and @xmath46 possessing lefschetz fibrations of the same genus , and glue them together along complements of the fiber , @xmath47 .    in general these surgeries change the homotopy type of the manifold , although in certain circumstances , for example if the complement of @xmath41 is simply connected , they will not chance the homeomorphisms type , but only change the diffeomorphism type .",
    "let us give a few examples of concordant surfaces , and spell out explicitly what theorem [ t:0concsurg ] is telling us with respect to some of the surgeries above .",
    "one easy way to construct a new embedded surface from and old one is by connect summing with a 2-knot .",
    "that is , given a surface @xmath48 and a 2-knot @xmath49 , we can form the surface @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",

    "moreover , if @xmath28 is a ribbon 2-knot , or more generally a knot which is 0-concordant to the unknot , then @xmath50 will be 0-concordant to @xmath52 , and hence the surgeries on @xmath52 are equivalent to the surgeries that can be done on @xmath50 by theorem [ t:0concsurg ] . in the case",
    "that @xmath52 is a torus , this means that if @xmath53 is the result of a long transform on @xmath52 , then there is a log transform on @xmath50 that also gives @xmath53 .",
    "however , if the complement of @xmath52 is simply connected , then @xmath52 and @xmath50 are smoothly equivalent to begin with by theorem [ t:0conciso ] .",
    "while it is unknown whether all 2-knots in @xmath16 are 0-concordant to the unknot , we can ask a similar question about surfaces in a general 4-manifold .",
    "are all concordant surfaces actually 0-concordant ?",
    "the answer is no . in @xcite , fintushel and stern construct examples of surfaces which are topologically isotopic ,",
    "have simply connected complement , but are not smoothly equivalent . by theorem [ t : main ]",
    ", they must be ( smoothly ) concordant , but if they were 0-concordant , they would be smoothly equivalent by theorem [ t:0conciso ] . on the other hand ,",
    "this does not mean that non - trivial surgeries on smoothly distinct surfaces always result in non - diffeomorphic manifolds .",
    "let @xmath54 be an embedded submanifold in @xmath1 .",

    "handles are not necessarily attached in from lowest index to highest , although by standard transversaltiy results , we can rearrange their attaching to be thus .",
    "such a handle decomposition is always induced from a morse function which takes its minimum on @xmath62 and its maximum on @xmath63 which moreover has no critical points on a collar of @xmath62 .    very often in this paper",
    "we will need to consider handle decompositions on cobordisms between manifolds with boundary .",
    "these can be thought of as manifolds with corners .",
    "in general it will be simplest to think of such cobordisms as being defined by a handlebody decomposition    @xmath68    where @xmath1 is a manifold with boundary , and the handles are attached to the the interior of @xmath69 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the manifolds representing the two ends of the cobordism ( which may have boundary themselves ) .",
    "the key example from this paper is @xmath72 where @xmath54 is some concordance from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( which will always be a codimension-2 embedding ) .",
    "we can construct such a relative handlebody decomposition on the concordance complement by taking a morse function that has its minimum on @xmath73 , and has no critical points on a collar of @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , if we know something about the embedding of @xmath54 , we can be even more explicit about how such a relative handlebody is constructed .",
    "in particular , the projection @xmath74 induces ( after a small perturbation of @xmath54 ) , a morse function and therefore relative handle structure on @xmath75 .",
    "it is explained in @xcite how such a handle decomposition on @xmath54 induces a dual handle decomposition on @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , every @xmath77-handle in @xmath54 contributes an @xmath78-handle to @xmath76 .",
    "since the fundamental group will be a constant consideration for us , let us explicitly describe what the dual decomposition of @xmath79 looks like when @xmath54 has a 1-handle . for concreteness , let the induced relative handle structure on @xmath80 in @xmath15 consist of a single 1-handle , hence inducing a dual relative handle - structure on @xmath81 as a single 2-handle attached to @xmath82 .",
    "if the 1-handle of @xmath54 is attached to @xmath83 at point @xmath84 and @xmath85 in @xmath86 , then the 2-handle in the dual decomposition is attached along meridians of @xmath84 and @xmath85 that have been band - summed together along the path of the 1-handle .",

    "when @xmath54 has a 1-handle , title=\"fig : \" ]      essentially all of the arguments in this paper also work in the topological category ( except for those dealing with 0-concordance , which are strictly smooth results ) .",
    "in most cases in this paper , the quickest route to this fact is to note that a punctured 4-manifold always possesses a smooth structure ( @xcite ) . therefore we can make smooth arguments in the complement of a point . as an example",

    "a general 0-concordance can be split into two ribbon concordancecs by lemma [ l:0concis2rib ] , so the theorem follows as in the ribbon case once we assume that surgery on both @xmath3 and @xmath4 gives simply connected manifolds .    notice that while we have stated this theorem in terms of embedded surfaces , the same applies to configurations of embedded surfaces .",
