    "finally we remark on the comparison of the above results with existing experimental data . for both singly and fully deuterated nma , biphasic relaxation @xmath129 of the amide",
    "i mode has been reported.@xcite the relaxation times are @xmath130 = 0.45 ps ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 = 4 ps for the singly deuterated nma,@xcite and @xmath130 = 0.38 ps ( @xmath133 ) and @xmath132 = 2.1 ps for the fully deuterated nma.@xcite comparing @xmath134 with our results obtained from the dynamic ver treatment and partial energy minimization , fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] shows excellent agreement between theory and experiment  maybe better as it can be expected from a simple force field modeling of the normal modes of the system .",
    "independent of force field uncertainties , however , is our finding that the ver of the amide i mode in nma consists of two phases ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig : nmad1 ] and [ fig : nmad7 ] ) .",
    "this is because for @xmath57 200 fs the system s spectral density appears continuous due to the frequency - time uncertainty relation , while at longer times the discrete nature of the bath becomes apparent . although it is tempting to speculate that this behavior can explain the experimentally obtained biphasic relaxation of nma , it is at present not clear if the approximations involved in our description allow for this conclusion .",
    "( e.g. , the validity of time - dependent perturbation theory deteriorates at longer times . ) nevertheless , the observation that amide i relaxation in larger peptides occurs in a monoexponential manner@xcite is consistent with the fact that the above described effect is expected to vanish for larger peptides with higher spectral density .",
    "we have outlined a computational approach to describe the energy relaxation of a high - frequency vibrational mode in a fluctuating heterogeneous environment . extending the previous work,@xcite",
    "we have employed second time - dependent perturbation theory , which includes the fluctuations of the parameters in the hamiltonian within the vibrationally adiabatic approximation .",
    "this means that the time - dependent vibrational frequencies along an md trajectory are obtained via a partial geometry optimization of the peptide with fixed solvent water and a subsequent normal mode calculation .",
    "although it requires more computational effort , the partial geometry optimization is necessary , because its omission results in unrealistically high fluctuations of the vibrational frequencies and other quantities ( see fig . [ fig : amidei ] ) .    adopting the amide i ver of nma in heavy water as a test problem",
    ", we have shown that the inclusion of dynamic fluctuations may significantly change the time evolution of the ver probability @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmad1 ] ) .",
    "after @xmath108 200 fs , we observe that the inhomogeneously approximated ver probabilities largely disperse , while the dynamic treatment leads to comparatively similar population decays for various md trajectories .",
    "this is because in the former case we use a constant resonance condition @xmath135 , while the time integration in the dynamic treatment averages over the time - dependent resonance condition .    to characterize the dominant energy flow pathways of the amide i ver of nma , we have introduced path - specific ver decay times and considered the fermi resonance parameter of the relaxation process . in the case of singly deuterated nma , mainly two combinations of bath modes",
    "were found to achieve the vibrational relaxation . in the case of fully deuterated nma , on the other hand",
    ", we have not observed such strongly resonant modes .",
    "instead we found that the subpicosecond decay of the overall ver probability @xmath99 is the result of numerous decay channels with relatively long path - specific decay times . in both cases",
    ", we observed that the ver of the amide i mode in nma consists of two phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nmad1 ] ) .",
    "this is because for @xmath57 200 fs the system s spectral density appears continuous due to the frequency - time uncertainty relation , while at longer times the discrete nature of the bath becomes apparent .",
    "considering our excellent agreement between theory and experiment ( see fig.[fig : exp ] ) , it may be speculated if this behavior can explain the experimentally obtained biphasic relaxation of nma .",
    "two directions for further researches are apparent . on a short time",
    "scale ( here @xmath0 200 fs ) , our results suggest that a single normal mode calculation should be sufficient to describe ver in peptides .",
    "the restriction to ultrashort time scales therefore allows us to employ high - quality _ ab initio _ methods to calculate the vibrational structure of even large molecules.@xcite on a longer time scale ( here @xmath108 500 fs ) , on the other hand , the validity of time - dependent perturbation theory is expected to deteriorate . as a straightforward extension",
    ", the vibrational dynamics may be described by stochastic schrdinger equations @xcite or stochastic liouville equations.@xcite    we thank phuong h. nguyen , sang - min park , tobias brandes , and john e. straub for discussions and helpful comments .",
