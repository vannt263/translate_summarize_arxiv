    "during the last two decades great progress has been made in understanding synchronization of chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , synchrony in dissipative dynamical systems with coexisting attractors remains relatively unexplored and poorly understood to this very day .",
    "this relative lack of activity is hard to reconcile with the fact that multistability has been observed in numerous nonlinear systems in many fields of science , such as laser physics @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , cardiac dynamics @xcite , genetics @xcite , cell signaling @xcite , and ecology @xcite amongst others ; moreover , in situations where synchronization is actually a collective behavior known to play a primary role .",
    "even forms of extreme multistability , i.e. the coexistence of infinitely many attractors in phase space , have been recently observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "many of these results as well as some known coupling mechanisms and dynamical phenomena that seem to be correlated to the emergence of multistability are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of two unidirectionally coupled systems ( master - slave configuration ) of rssler - like @xcite , duffing @xcite and rssler - lorenz @xcite oscillators , as well as hnon maps @xcite have been studied , and some experiments along these lines have been carried out @xcite .",
    "bidirectionally coupled neuronal models @xcite also display very rich synchronous dynamics .",
    "one of the most prominent features of all these examples is the intricate dependence of synchronization on the initial conditions , a distinct feature of multistable systems that is nowhere to be found in monostable systems .",
    "phenomena such as anticipated intermittent phase synchronization , period - doubling synchronization , and intermittent switches between coexisting type - i and on - off intermittencies have been discovered @xcite . on the other hand , even though the existence and stability of multistable synchronous solutions in locally coupled kuramoto models have been studied @xcite , to our knowledge , the issue of under what conditions synchronization of more than two coupled generic ( and possibly chaotic ) multistable oscillators is guaranteed has not been addressed yet .",
    "furthermore , synchronization of multistable systems in the presence of intermittency still remains an unexplored problem .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a methodology for studying the synchronization of multistable oscillators , which we illustrate with the example of a bistable system which has the great advantage of being experimentally implemented in electronic circuits .",
    "first , we demonstrate the high complexity of the basins of attraction of coexisting states in a solitary bistable oscillator , and the increasing complexity when two of such oscillators interact with each other giving rise to intermittency .",
    "second , we investigate the influence of both the initial conditions and the coupling strength on the synchronization of two bidirectionally coupled bistable systems ( with diffusive coupling ) in different coexisting synchronous states , including the existence of intermittency . then , we discuss the master stability function ( msf ) @xcite approach to the study of the stability of a synchronization manifold of @xmath0 coupled multistable systems .",
    "specifically , we obtain the msf for different coexisting chaotic attractors in a dynamical system separately , and then we evaluate how the modification of the coupling parameter allows the system to leave / enter a particular synchronization regime associated with a particular attractor without loss of synchrony in the whole network , even in the presence of intermittency .",
    "finally , we check the robustness of our theoretical predictions with electronic circuits to show the validity of our results for real systems where a certain parameter mismatch always exists .",
    "the main aim of our work is to develop a methodology that adequately predicts synchronizability in ensembles of bidirectionally coupled multistable systems . with this aim",
    ", we choose the piecewise linear rssler oscillator as a paradigmatic example of a bistable system with two coexisting chaotic attractors @xcite . when an unidirectional coupling is introduced , the coupled rssler - like system exhibits very rich dynamics , including such phenomena as intermittency , frequency - shifting and frequency - locking @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , little is known about synchronization scenarios for ensembles of bidirectionally coupled multistable systems , despite the fact that bidirectional coupling itself can lead to the emergence of multiple attractors @xcite .",

    "the parameter values are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for this parameter choice ,",
    "the system is known to be a bistable chaotic system ( i.e. the phase portrait displays two different chaotic attractors ) , as previously reported in @xcite .",
    "unlike most previously studied multistable systems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , this system exhibits multistability in the autonomous evolution , without the need for chaotic driving .",
    "moreover , this system can be implemented in electronic circuits to experimentally assess the validity of the theoretical predictions .    from any arbitrary initial condition within a bounded region in phase space",
    "the system rapidly converges to one of the two chaotic attractors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",

    "two spirals are clearly visible , where initial conditions leading to one or the other attractor seem to be intertwined .",
    "each of these spirals has a fixed point of the system as its focus , as has been previously reported in @xcite . in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) shows .",
    "we have checked that this structure is preserved for another 4 orders of magnitude , with no end in sight for even lower space scales .",
    "indeed , this is not altogether surprising , as basins that are interwoven in a complicated fashion and fractal basins boundaries feature prominently in the phase portraits of many multistable systems ( see @xcite for review of fractal basin boundaries and fractal sets in nonlinear dynamics in general ) .",
    "although the precise characterization of these boundaries is outside the scope of this paper , we would like to stress how difficult it is to control the asymptotic dynamics of just one single oscillator under the presence of noise or uncertainties for initial conditions starting in certain regions of the phase space .",

    "the proposed methodology is of a special interest for a stability analysis of synchronization in multistable systems during intermittency , since any monostable approach to synchronization is bound to fail in that regime , and knowing the coupling strength or the topological modifications required to maintain complete synchronization under any possible attractor dynamics is especially useful in that scenario .",
