    "the problem of measuring and understanding the binding energy of noble gas atoms on metal substrates has always been of considerable interest @xcite . the atomic binding is that energy released when an atom from the vapor sticks to the surface .",
    "several studies have related atomic binding to surface charge distributions@xcite . induced surface electronic dipole moments near the adsorbed atom have been of particular interest . in the work which follows ,",
    "the intimate relationship between binding energy and induced atomic charge will be considered in theoretical detail .",
    "as the atom is lowered onto the surface and becomes adsorbed , the atomic dipole tends to be oriented with the positive side of the dipole pointing away from the metal . in reality",
    ", the negative side of the atomic dipole is better thought to be _ on average _ an electron ( negative ) charge @xmath0 donated to the metal .",
    "this leaves the atom with a positive net mean charge @xmath1 .",
    "the physical situation is pictured in fig.1 below . even in a situation often regarded as physisorption",
    ", one does not expect a noble gas atom to remain in perfect charge neutrality .",
    "when the atom is adsorbed on the substrate , the negative end of the atomic dipole moment neutralizes the positive end of the _ image _ dipole moment .",
    "this leaves a mean net positive charge on the atom and a mean negative electronic charge deposited in the metal . from an experimental viewpoint ,",
    "the positive nature of the mean charge on an adsorbed noble gas atom is equivalent to the donation of a negative charge to the metal .",
    "the physical effect is made manifest @xcite by the diminution of the electronic work function as the first monolayer of atoms is deposited on the metallic substrate surface .",
    "this effect is quite large and is observed for all combinations of gases and metals@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the reduction of the work function is proportional to the amount of adsorbate and for coverage up to a monolayer@xcite .    in secs .",
    "ii and iii the long ranged part of van der waals interaction between a noble gas atom and a metal will be reviewed .",
    "the height of the atom , over and above the metal surface , is considered to be large compared with the atomic size .",
    "the interaction is between a quantum fluctuating dipole and its correlated image .",
    "both the binding energy and the probability of electronic excitation will be computed numerically in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v , non - perturbative expressions for the binding energy and the probability of electronic excitation are derived . in sec .",
    "vi it is shown that the stronger the binding energy the larger the net atomic adsorptive charges .",
    "the physical importance of the adsorptive charge on a noble gas atom is discussed in the concluding sec .",
    "suppose a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 in which @xmath3 represents an unperturbed energy eigenvalue problem , and @xmath4 represents the perturbed energy eigenvalue problem . without loss of generality ,",
    "one may assume ( for the unperturbed ground state wave function ) that @xmath5    two quantities of importance are the exact ground state energy @xmath6 , and the probability that the interaction @xmath7 introduces an excitation in the unperturbed quantum states @xmath8 in lowest order perturbation theory , one then finds the energy shift @xcite @xmath9 the ground state wave function in first order perturbation theory@xcite is given by @xmath10 the first order wave equation can be used to compute the excitation probability @xmath11 to second order in the perturbation potential ; it is @xmath12 let us apply these ideas to the casimir effect , i.e. the attractive force on an atom located at height @xmath13 above a metallic substrate .",
    "the final energy is well known .",
    "however , the excitation probability of the atom will also be calculated .",
    "let the unperturbed problem consist of an isolated atom and an isolated metal @xmath14 with @xmath15 as a double index referring to the atomic state @xmath16 and the metallic substrate state @xmath17 , we may write @xmath18 with an unperturbed energy @xmath19    further , let the interaction between the atom and metal be of the dipole form @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the atomic electric dipole moment operator , and the electric field * e * is produced by the metal .",
    "the second order perturbation interaction energy between the atom and the metal is usually called the casimir effect and is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the atomic bohr frequencies are defined as @xmath25 and the metallic bohr frequencies are defined as @xmath26    for an isotropic atom , one may define a ground state dipole moment quantum noise spectral function @xmath27 similarly , one may define the electric field quantum zero point fluctuations due to the metal @xmath28 one may now compute the casimir energy@xcite @xmath29 in terms of these spectral functions ; i.e. @xmath30 finally , one may find the spectral functions by employing the zero point quantum fluctuation response theorems@xcite .",
    "for example , if the atomic polarization response to an external electric field at complex frequency @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 defines the ground state atomic polarizability @xmath34 for a spherical atom , then the fluctuation response theorem theorem asserts @xmath35 the fluctuation spectral function for the electrostatic field @xmath36 produced by the metal is a bit more subtle .",
    "if an external charge density at complex frequency @xmath31 produces an electrostatic potential according to the rule @xmath37 then the spectral function for zero point electrostatic potential fluctuations @xmath38 @xmath39 obeys the fluctuation response theorem in the form @xmath40 for the problem at hand , suppose that the metal is located in the half - space @xmath41 ; e.g. the substrate surface is the @xmath42 @xmath43-@xmath44 plane",
    ". if both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in the vacuum ( i.e. @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , then the `` method of images '' yields the greens function @xmath49 where @xmath50 has a corresponding `` image '' position @xmath51 and @xmath52 the dielectric response function for the metal @xmath53 determines the conductivity @xmath54 via @xmath55 thus @xmath56 with @xmath57 denoting the position of the atom at a height @xmath13 above the substrate surface , the electric field zero point fluctuations of the electric field at the atom may be computed via @xmath58 @xmath59 the differentiation is tedious but direct .",
    "it yields @xmath60    substituting eqs.(22 ) and ( 34 ) into eq.(20 ) yields the zero - point fluctuation casimir effect potential @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 the casimir form of the van der waals potential between an atom and a conducting surface is well known .",
    "the purpose for reviewing the van der waals result is that now we may also calculate the probability that the atom at a height @xmath13 is in an excited state .    the excited state probability in eq.(5 ) , when evaluated to the lowest order perturbation theory in eq.(8 ) , yields the casimir excited state probability @xmath64 . in the casimir perturbation theory",
    ", the probability for the atom to be in an excited state contains an extra energy denominator .",
    "the final result is in the simple form @xmath65 the parameter @xmath66 is a rough measure of the effective atomic volume ; it is @xmath67 @xmath68    the excited state probability in eq.(37 ) is a new result .",
    "the noble gas atom above the metal , is _ not _ electronically inert .",
    "the atom in the vacuum is in the ground state , as the atom is lowered toward the metal surface , the atomic electronic state becomes excited with probability @xmath69 . for heights @xmath13 such that @xmath70 we have @xmath71 as in eq.(37 ) . numerical results for the probability @xmath64 then follow ( below ) in a similar manner to numerical results for @xmath29 which have been previously computed by other workers .",
    "for the purpose of numerical evaluations of parameters associated with the van der waals interaction , we follow rauber , klein , cole and bruch@xcite ; they choose a single pole approximation for both @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the pole in @xmath72 is parameterized by an atomic frequency @xmath74 , while the pole in @xmath73 is parameterized by a plasma frequency @xmath75 .    in detail , the approximations read @xmath76 along with @xmath77    eqs.(36 ) , ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) and ( 40 ) yield @xmath78 and @xmath79    the values of the atomic parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 have been previously tabulated@xcite . and are listed in table i. the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , ( for several metals ) have also been previously tabulated@xcite and are here listed in table ii . in table iii",
    ", we have computed the values of @xmath84 and @xmath66 .",
    "the probability of atomic excitation in the casimir regime @xmath85 can be calculated in the limit of large @xmath86 .",
    "when the height of the atom obeys @xmath87 , the perturbation theory is reliable .",
    "however , for atoms adsorbed on a submonolayer of film the height @xmath88 is not large .",
    "thus a non - perturbative method is required .",

    "the above considerations are true for atoms above a metal in the perturbative limit @xmath91 .",
    "when the atom is adsorbed on the metal surface , a non - perturbative viewpoint must be invoked@xcite .",
    "for example , consider the ground state matrix element analytic in the upper half complex energy plane @xmath92 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the unperturbed ground state , @xmath95 and the binding energy of the adsorbed atom , @xmath96 is determined by the full electronic ground state @xmath97    one may write eq.(43 ) in the exact form @xmath98 where the self energy part @xmath99 determines the atomic binding energy @xmath100 @xmath101 has a simple pole at the exact ground state energy @xmath102 .",
    "the residue at the pole is the transition probability @xmath103 ; i.e. @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "the exact expression for the self energy part reads @xmath106 where @xmath107 and where @xmath108 projects into the subspace normal to the unperturbed ground state .",
    "for example , from eq.(49 ) and the definition of @xmath109 one finds the mean value @xmath110 given by @xmath111 the details of the mathematical derivation of eqs.(47)-(51 ) are given in the appendix .",
    "suppose that the atom ( located on the metal surface ) starts out in the unperturbed state @xmath94 .",
    "the atom will then decay into its renormalized ground state , giving up its excess binding energy @xmath112 to the bulk electrons in the metal .",
    "the transition rate per unit time to deposit an electronic energy @xmath113 to the metal is given by @xmath114 from eqs.(50 ) and ( 52 ) it follows that @xmath115 thus the binding energy @xmath116 is rigorously determined by eqs.(48 ) and ( 53 ) to be @xmath117 while eqs.(51 ) and ( 53 ) imply @xmath118 where @xmath119    in the perturbative limit , @xmath120 where the casimir values @xmath121 and @xmath122 have been defined , respectively , in eqs.(35 ) and ( 37 ) .",
    "for the non - perturbative limit of atomic adsorption for a finite height @xmath123 , the exact results of eqs.(54 ) , ( 55 ) and ( 56 ) can be employed for making realistic estimates of the effective charge @xmath124 of the atom .",
    "for estimating the effective charge on the adsorbed atom , we note the following : ( i ) eq.(54 ) is an implicit equation for the binding energy @xmath125 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath126 , then @xmath127 , where a constant `` cut - off '' must be placed in the logarithm . ( iii ) we employ the following simple dispersion formula for @xmath128 : over a bandwidth @xmath129 , we consider @xmath130 to be uniform . outside this interval , i.e. for electronic energies above the atomic energy cut - off @xmath131 in table i , we consider @xmath128 to be negligible . under this assumption , the binding energy eq.(54 )",
    "reads @xmath132 if @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , eq.(56 ) reads @xmath134    the probability of excitation @xmath135 determines the effective charge via eqs.(55 ) , ( 58 ) and ( 59 ) @xmath136 a plot of the effective charge versus the binding energy is shown in fig.2 .    in terms of experimental binding energies and mean atomic excitation energies listed table i , the effective charges can be computed numerically from eq.(60 ) .",
    "a dispersion theory has been presented for computing the effective charge per noble gas atom adsorbed on metallic substrates .",
    "the general physical situation , shown in fig.1 , is complimentary to the charge density functional approach for computing atomic binding.@xcite both approaches yield a picture in which there is an atomic dipole moment .",
    "the negative end of the dipole moment is better viewed as the donation of a mean negative electronic charge to the metal below .",
    "the positive end of the atomic dipole moment , is what has been called the net atomic charge @xmath137 .",
    "the advantage to the dispersion method is that it fits smoothly into the power law limit of the well known casimir force . in the density functional approach",
    ", the `` image charges '' are added in `` by hand '' . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge density functional approach is intuitive on a microscopic level .",
    "the evidence for @xmath138 is based on the change in metallic work function due to adding submonolayer adatoms , for thicker films the situation is complex.@xcite the work function can _ increase _ as the film thickness increases for film layers above the monolayer .",
    "this experimental fact has ( thus far ) no simple theoretical explanation .        in this appendix , the details of the mathematical derivation of results in sec .",
    "v will be made explicit .",
