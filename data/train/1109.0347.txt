    "the cms observation of angular and long range rapidity correlations in the hadron spectrum , the so called `` ridge '' in proton - proton collisions@xcite , has triggered a lot of discussions in recent literature @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in particular the approaches of the three last papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite are based on the idea that correlated gluon emission is due to the correlations in impact parameter plane preexisting in the incoming wave function of the target and projectile hadrons . such correlations certainly exist in a hadron wave function , and in the context of high energy evolution can be encoded in the initial conditions for the evolution .",
    "it was also argued in @xcite that the correlations are leading effect in @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to address the question what is the fate of such correlations as the hadron is evolved to high energy . in particular",
    "we ask whether these correlations can be studied by evolving the target / projectile wave functions with jimwlk evolution@xcite ( or the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation , which is its large @xmath0 limit@xcite ) . to this end",
    "we perform simple numerical calculations and supplement them with qualitative analysis based on physics of the jimwlk evolution .",
    "our numerics is performed in the framework of the dipole model approximation to jimwlk evolution , and thus is sensitive only to the leading @xmath0 part of jimwlk , but we believe that , with minor modifications our conclusions are valid for full jimwlk evolution as well .",
    "our conclusions are the following .",
    "we find that the jimwlk evolution leads to exponentially quick disappearance of correlations ( including angular correlations relevant for gluon emission ) with rapidity .",
    "this disappearance is straightforward to understand .",
    "it is the consequence of the fact that jimwlk evolution is valid only for color field modes with transverse momenta smaller than the saturation momentum where one indeed _ does not expect _ correlations to be present . as was discussed in @xcite , we expect correlations to be present only for points in transverse plane within the saturation radius of each other , and therefore for momentum modes greater or equal to the saturation momentum .",
    "the evolution of these modes even in a dense hadronic wave function is not governed by the jimwlk evolution but rather by klwmij evolution@xcite for @xmath2 and by the reggeon field theory ( rft ) including pomeron loops@xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "the failure of jimwlk to properly account for correlations should be understood in the following way .",
    "the evolved wave function of a hadron does indeed contain correlations in impact parameter space , even in the leading order in @xmath1 expansion .",
    "this has been shown analytically and numerically for angular independent correlations within mueller s dipole model@xcite in @xcite , and there is every reason to expect that this is also the case for angle dependent correlations of interest to us .",
    "however jimwlk evolution approximates the scattering amplitude of two dipoles on a hadronic target by contributions where the two dipoles scatter on gluons with vastly different rapidities ( this has been dubbed `` long range multiple scatterings '' in @xcite ) .",
    "since the correlations in the wave functions are between gluons which are close in rapidity to each other , these correlations are simply not included in the jimwlk equation .",
    "while jimwlk approximation does properly account for leading contributions to the scattering amplitude in the saturated regime , it significantly underestimates those for small ( smaller than saturation radius ) dipoles . to account properly for rapidity evolution of the scattering amplitude of small dipoles",
    ", one needs to evolve it with klwmij evolution equation .",
    "the klwmij evolution does indeed include the \" ` short range multiple scattering contribution\"@xcite and should correctly describe correlations in impact parameter plane .",
    "the obvious complication here is , that since we are interested in a dense target ( corresponding to high multiplicity events in the cms data ) , it certainly contains low momentum modes which evolve according to jimwlk .",
    "thus we are faced with the situation where proper treatment of angular correlations at high energy requires us to include both klwmij and jimwlk evolutions within the same framework , and in this sense we have to deal explicitly with the pomeron loop effects .",
    "in fact this necessity is even more acute , since the pomeron loops give leading contributions to the evolution of the modes at @xmath3 , and it is presumably these modes that contribute most to angular correlations .",
    "we thus conclude that future attempts to properly numerically estimate the size of correlations at high energy will require explicit inclusion of the pomeron loop effects .",
    "we note that the notion that it is the pomeron loops that are crucial for correlations at high energy is not new @xcite , here we merely recast this argument in the framework of jimwlk / klwmij evolution .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "2 we recap the arguments of @xcite about angular correlations in gluon emission , recasting them in a somewhat more transparent semiclassical form . in sec .",
    "3 we present results of our numerical calculations of the evolution of angular correlations in the dipole model ( leading @xmath0 jimwlk ) . finally in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the interpretation of these results based on the physical picture of jimwlk / klwmij evolution and flesh out the arguments for necessity of pomeron loops .",
    "in our previous note @xcite we discussed a simple picture of long range rapidity correlations and angular correlations between particles produced in a collision of two high energy dense objects .",
    "this quialitative picture also underlies the calculations of @xcite,@xcite .",
    "long range rapidity correlation is an almost trivial consequence of boost invariance of a projectile wave function at high energy .",
    "consider high energy scattering of a hadronic projectile on a stationary target in the lab frame . in the lab frame ,",
    "the incoming particles are very energetic and they scatter by a very small angle with @xmath4 . thus recoil is negligible and eikonal approximation is applicable at high enough energy .",
    "since the projectile is very energetic , its wave function is approximately boost invariant . in a boost invariant wave function",
    "gluon distribution at rapidity @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the same . these gluons scatter on exactly the same target , and thus whatever happens at @xmath5 also happens at @xmath6 .",
    "if for a particular target field configuration a gluon is likely to be produced at @xmath5 at some impact parameter , a gluon is also likely to be produced at @xmath6 at the same impact parameter , thus leading to long range rapidity correlations .",
    "thus the long range rapidity correlations come practically for free whenever the energy is high enough so that the wave function of the incoming hadron is approximately boost invariant , and there is very little in the actual dynamics of the collision that can affect this feature .    to understand why angular correlations also naturally arise in the context of high energy",
    "let us briefly recap our understanding of the transverse structure of the hadron in the saturation regime .",
    "it is convenient to think of the distribution of the ( color ) electric field configurations in the target .",
    "the target wave function is characterized by the saturation momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the saturation momentum plays a dual role in the hadronic wave function .",
    "first , it measures the typical magnitude of electric field in the wave function .",
    "the scattering amplitude of a dipole on the target is given in terms of simple parton scattering amplitude @xmath8 as @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the vector potential is simply related to the electric field as @xmath10 .",
    "let us for convenience define electric field integrated over the longitudinal extent of the target , @xmath11 .",
    "the dipole scattering amplitude is then given in terms of @xmath12 , and assuming for illustrative purposes that odd powers of @xmath13 average to zero in the hadronic ensemble , we have roughly @xmath14 this is of order unity for @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand it is known that the field components with transverse momenta @xmath16 are suppressed in the wave function@xcite .",
    "this means that the electric fields in the target are correlated on the length scale @xmath17 .",
    "thus the saturation momentum doubles up as the inverse of the correlation length of target color fields .",
    "typical field configurations in the target can thus be thought of having a domain like structure of fig",
    ". 1 .        now consider a projectile parton with charge @xmath18 impinging on one of the domains of the target .",
    "while traversing the target field , the parton acquires transverse momentum @xmath19 a parton at a different rapidity but with the same charge will pick up exactly the same transverse momentum if it scatters on the same `` domain '' .",
    "this of course results in positive angular correlation of produced gluons .",
    "we note in passing that this simple picture also explains the fact noted in @xcite that angular correlations at angle @xmath20 and @xmath21 have equal strength . at high energy particle production",
    "is dominated by gluons .",
    "gluons of course belong to real representation of the gauge group , thus it is equally probable to find an incoming gluon with charge @xmath18 and charge @xmath22 in the projectile wave function at any rapidity .",
    "suppose , for example that a given configuration the color field in the target is in the third direction in color space @xmath23 , while the gluons in the incoming projectile corresponds to the vector potential in the second direction @xmath24 .",
    "one can always write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is positively charged with respect to color charge in the third direction , and @xmath27 is negatively charged .",
    "thus necessarily equal number of gluons in the incoming projectile have opposite sign charges and are kicked in opposite directions while scattering on the target .",
    "this produces equal strength correlations at angles zero and @xmath28 .",
    "this is not the case for quarks which carry fundamental charges , and it is quite clear that taking into account the projectile quarks will lead to stronger positive angular correlation than the negative one .",
    "going beyond the qualitative picture described above , the two gluon inclusive production probability discussed in @xcite is given by@xcite ( see also @xcite )    @xmath29    with @xmath30                         [ s(\\bar x_1)-s(\\bar z)]\\ \\tilde \\rho(\\bar x_1 )         \\ , .",
    "\\label{sigma}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in these formulae @xmath33 is the valence color charge density in the projectile wave function , while @xmath34 is the eikonal scattering matrix determined by the target color fields .",
    "the charge density is normalized such that for a single gluon @xmath35 .",
    "the two gluons here are produced independently of each other , but from exactly the same configuration of color charge sources while scattering on the same target field configuration .",
    "the average in eq.([product ] ) denotes averaging over the projectile and the target wave functions .",
    "the averaging over @xmath36 is understood as averaging over a classical ensemble with a probability distribution function @xmath37 $ ] @xcite @xmath38 \\,o\\ .\\label{average}\\ ] ] and similarly for the target average . after averaging over all target and projectile configurations , the single gluon emission amplitude @xmath39 must be isotropic .",
    "however for any given configuration it is not isotropic and peaked in one particular direction .",
    "this anisotropy produces angular correlation among the emitted gluons as discussed above . to reiterate , for a _ fixed configuration _ of the projectile sources @xmath40 and target fields @xmath41 , the function @xmath42 as a function of momentum has a maximum at some value @xmath43 .",
    "therefore the product in eq.([sigma ] ) is maximal for @xmath44 .",
    "the value of the vector @xmath45 of course differs from one configuration to another , but the fact that momenta @xmath46 and @xmath47 are parallel does not .",
    "therefore after averaging over the ensemble @xmath48 has maximum at relative zero angle between the two momenta ( as we have explained above , there is actually the second degenerate maximum at relative angle @xmath49 ) .",
    "the strength of the maximum of course depends on the detailed nature of the field configurations constituting the two ensembles ( the projectile and the target ) .",
    "thus , angular correlations emerge as a result of target / projectile averaging procedure over isotropic ensembles of anisotropic configurations .",
    "we note that eq.([sigma ] ) holds in the case when one of the colliding objects is dense and another one is dilute@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is most likely not quite the situation encountered in the high multiplicity p - p events at lhc , where the density in the proton wave function is likely still not parametrically large , but is already not perturbatively small .",
    "the main features of our discussion are however born out by the expression eq.([product ] ) and we believe this approximation to be qualitatively correct .",
    "we note that the numerical calculations of @xcite use a further perturbatively expanded version of eq.([sigma ] ) .",
    "the approach to the dense - dense regime has been developed in @xcite and has been used in @xcite .",
    "it is however not clear that in the lhc environment it is quantitatively more reliable than simple expression eq.([sigma ] ) .",
    "when the dense system is produced in the final state , we expect the correlations produced by this mechanism to be washed out by the final state interactions and finally disappear for a very dense final state",
    ". there may be an alternative mechanism of producing angular correlations via radial flow effects@xcite which could be relevant to the ridge structure observed at rhic@xcite , but this is far beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "returning to eq.([product ] ) , we note that angular correlations should be the leading @xmath1 effect @xcite . the leading @xmath0 piece in eq.([product ] ) comes from the configuration where the charge densities in each one of the single gluon production amplitudes are in the color singlet .",
    "the relevant average to calculate is @xmath50                         [ s(\\bar x_1)-s(\\bar z)]\\right\\}{\\rm tr}\\left\\{[s^\\dagger ( x_2)-s^\\dagger ( u ) ]                         [ s(\\bar x_2)-s(\\bar u)]\\right\\}\\rangle_t\\ , .",

    "the approximation which is frequently used in the literature to calculate the averages of this type also invokes factorization @xmath53 strict factorization of the type eq.([fact ] ) is only possible if the statistical ensemble either consists of a single configuration , or the target fields on which the two dipoles scatter are completely independent of each other .",
    "there is of course no reason to expect that in the large @xmath0 limit fluctuations around some leading configurations are suppressed by powers of @xmath1 . likewise , since we are interested in dipoles which scatter within correlation radius of each other , the field configurations should be by definition correlated .",
    "thus the factorization eq.([fact ] ) is not appropriate for study of correlations .",
    "our objective in this note is a pilot study of the evolution in energy of correlations which one can encode in the initial target ensemble . as a framework for the evolution",
    "we take the projectile dipole model , which describes the evolution of @xmath54 in the leading @xmath0 limit .",
    "it is important at this point to avoid confusion and understand clearly which dipole model we are talking about , as there are two distinct approximations to the high energy evolution which are both sometimes called dipole model .    in the first , which we will call target dipole model , one follows the evolution of the target wave function in terms of the density of dipoles ( and their cumulants )",
    "this evolution as formulated in@xcite does not take into account finite density effects in the target wave function and is the large @xmath0 limit of the klwmij evolution@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite studied correlations and fluctuations of dipole density in this approach for a single dipole target and found them to be significant in the leading order in @xmath1 .",
    "another dipole approach , which we will refer to as the projectile dipole model , evolves the projectile wave function according to dipole evolution .",
    "the projectile scattering amplitude is then calculated by approximating the scattering amplitude of each projectile dipole by an eikonal factor .",
    "this approximation can be reformulated as the evolution of the target wave function .",
    "in this form it is a large @xmath0 approximation to the jimwlk evolution of the target wave function , that is , it does indeed take into account nonlinearities in the target evolution .",
    "the two dipole approximations implement very different physics in the target wave function .",
    "our choice of the projectile dipole approximation is motivated by the expectation that high density effects in the target evolution should be important , and also by the fact that it is this approximation ( or jimwlk which includes @xmath1 corrections to it @xcite ) that is used in current numerical studies of ridge@xcite .",
    "we note however that this approximation _ does not _",
    "take into account proper splittings of the target dipoles , as stressed in @xcite . as we show in the next section numerically , and explain qualitatively in sec",
    "4 this deficiency turns out to be crucial in the inability of this approximation to correctly evolve correlations present in the initial ensemble .    the probability distribution of the dipole model @xmath55 $ ] evolves with rapidity according to @xcite @xmath56=   \\frac { \\bar{\\alpha}_s}{2\\,\\pi}\\ , \\int_{x , y , z}\\frac{(x - y)^2}{(x - z)^2\\,(z\\,-\\,y)^2}\\,\\left[\\,s(x,\\,y)\\,-\\ , \\,s(x , z)\\,s(y , z)\\,\\,\\right ] \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta s(x , y ) } w[s]\\ ] ] with @xmath57 - the thooft coupling , which is finite at infinite @xmath0 .",
    "our strategy is to choose an ensemble @xmath58 $ ] of initial configurations @xmath59 , which contains nontrivial angular correlations .",

    "this procedure is similar to the one implemented in @xcite .",
    "however , the focus of @xcite was in fluctuations of the saturation scale and thus all configurations in the initial ensemble in @xcite were chosen to be isotropic . in order to study angular correlations we have to allow the individual members @xmath62 of the initial ensemble to be anisotropic .",
    "the rotational invariance is restored by averaging over the whole ensemble rather than configuration by configuration .    here",
    "we report on our initial results , which mostly aim at qualitative understanding of rapidity dependence of angular correlations within the projectile dipole evolution .",
    "like in most bk studies we do not consider impact parameter dependence .",
    "we view the resulting correlations as correlations at a fixed impact parameter , thus strictly speaking study of correlations in impact parameter plane are beyond our current calculation .",
    "nevertheless we do not expect our results on weakening of correlations with rapidity at a fixed impact parameter to be affected by configuration by configuration fluctuations in the impact parameter plane .    for the sake of simplicity we do not calculate the two gluon production rate eq.([product ] ) but rather examine the simplest observable that can exhibit angular correlations - the correlator of two dipole scattering amplitudes @xmath63 .",

    "these two dipole models are large @xmath0 limits of the jimwlk and klwmij evolutions respectively , and in the rest of this section we will not distinguish between the corresponding evolution and its large @xmath0 limit .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the jimwlk and klwmij evolutions are very different as far as the target wave function is concerned .",
    "klwmij is the normal perturbative evolution of the target wave function .",
    "it is well known that in such evolution the number of gluons grows exponentially fast .",
    "the gluon density , which in this regime satisfies the bfkl equation , depends on the total rapidity as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a number of order one and @xmath95 is the total rapidity by which the target wave function has been boosted from \" ` rest `` .",
    "the exponential dependence is also true for the differential gluon density at any rapidity @xmath116 , namely ( we suppress the momentum dependence in the prefactor for simplicity ) @xmath117 gluons in the wave function which are separated in rapidity by no more than @xmath118 are correlated .",
    "since the gluon density in the wave function exponentially grows with rapidity , any projectile that probes such a wave function effectively feels only the gluons in the last rapidity ' '  bin\". thus such a probe is sensitive to any correlation that exists between the softest gluons in the wave function .",
    "now consider jimwlk evolution .",
    "the rapidity dependence of gluon density generated by the jimwlk evolution is very different . as discussed in @xcite , while the probability to emit an additional gluon in the dilute regime is proportional to the number of gluons in the wave function , in the dense regime this probability approaches a constant .",
    "the amplitude of the emission depends on the color fields in the target @xmath119 , roughly as @xmath120 in the dilute system this is proportional to the chromo - electric field @xmath13 , while in the dense regime , where @xmath121 this is a constant .",
    "the evolution with constant probability of emission generates gluon density which is uniformly distributed in rapidity . this can be thought of as a random walk in color space as in @xcite .",
    "so now one has @xmath122 with @xmath123 a function of transverse momentum , but not of rapidity .",
    "it is still true , like in the klwmij case , that gluons separated by a small rapidity interval are correlated , while the correlation disappears for gluons at very different rapidities .",
    "now , as opposed to klwmij however if one scatters any projectile on such a target , the projectile will sample gluons at all rapidities equally .",
    "thus , for example , if the projectile consists of two dipoles , the two dipoles will most likely scatter on color field components ( gluons ) with very different rapidities . since",
    "such fields are not correlated , the two dipoles will scatter independently and the two dipole scattering amplitude will not exhibit any correlations .",
    "another way of understanding the difference between the nature of jimwlk and klwmij evolutions is the following . in klwmij evolution one starts initially with the target wave function which contains a small number of gluons .",
    "the probability to emit an additional gluon in one step of the evolution is small ( @xmath124 ) , however if a gluon is emitted , the end configuration strongly differs from the initial one , since the number of gluons have changed by a factor of order unity .",
    "such evolution thus generates a very rough ensemble of target field ( gluon ) configurations .",
    "in this ensemble configurations with very different properties are present , albeit with small weight .",
    "such an ensemble must exhibit large fluctuations in a variety of observables .",
    "on the other hand , in jimwlk evolution the probability to emit an extra gluon is large - of order unity .",
    "however emission of an extra gluon produces a new configuration which is hardly distinct from the existing one , since the one extra gluon is produced on the background of @xmath125 gluons which already exist in the wave function .",
    "thus the jimwlk ensemble is very different - it contains many configurations , but all these configurations have very similar properties .",
    "the fluctuations in observables in such an ensemble are very small .",
    "thus we conclude that klwmij evolution must produce ( and preserve ) correlations ( and fluctuations ) between scattering amplitudes of two projectile dipoles .",
    "these are indeed the correlations discussed in @xcite . on the other hand jimwlk evolution",
    "must lead to disappearance of any correlations initially present in the target ensemble , as we have seen in our calculations .",
    "given that the two approximation to high energy evolution lead to such qualitatively different answers for the observable we are interested in , naturally one should ask which one of them , if any should be used in quantitative calculations . naively one might think , that since we are interested in high multiplicity situation , the target is dense and jimwlk evolution is more suitable .",
    "this however is not the case . recall that we expect the correlations to arise due to scattering at close values of impact parameter .",
    "the transverse distances in question should be smaller or of the order of the saturation radius @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the scattering occurs on the components of the target color field with transverse momenta @xmath126 .",
    "however at these momenta the target wave function by definition is still dilute .",
    "even for a dense target jimwlk evolution is not appropriate for all wavelengths . referring to eq.([amplitude1 ] )",
    "we see that the amplitude is independent of the field only when we can neglect the derivative relative to the field @xmath12 in the expression for covariant derivative , in other words only for momenta greater than the saturation momentum .",
    "thus in the dense target , we expect the gluon density to behave roughly as @xmath127 at large momenta @xmath128 the appropriate evolution is klwmij and not jimwlk .    thus to be able to describe fluctuations one needs to be able to evolve the high momentum modes according to klwmij while low momentum modes according to jimwlk .",
    "in fact , the situation is even more complicated .",
    "one expects that the largest contribution to correlations comes from the modes with @xmath129 of order @xmath7 , since in the relative distances of order @xmath93 should dominate the integral over impact parameter . for these modes however , the pomeron merging and splitting ( jimwlk and klwmij contributions ) are of equal importance . in other words ,",
    "this momentum range is sensitive at the leading order to the pomeron loop contributions .",
    "we thus conclude that pomeron loops need to be included for proper treatment of this question .",
