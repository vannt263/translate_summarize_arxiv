    "the availability of quantum - degenerate bosonic atomic systems has recently allowed the extension of atom optics to the nonlinear @xcite and the quantum regimes .",
    "matter - wave four - wave mixing @xcite , coherent matter - wave amplification @xcite and superradiance @xcite , the generation of dark @xcite and bright @xcite atomic solitons and of correlated atomic pairs @xcite have been demonstrated , and so has the matter - wave analog of second - harmonic generation , the creation of a molecular condensate component @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the development of the nonlinear atom optics of fermionic atomic systems is not nearly as far along .",
    "while it has been shown theoretically @xcite that the four - wave mixing of fermionic matter waves is possible in principle , these predictions have not been verified experimentally so far .",
    "still , the recent achievement of temperatures as low as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi temperature , for the fermions @xmath2k and @xmath3li @xcite is encouraging , and it is hoped that first experiments on fermionic nonlinear atom optics will take place in the near future . in addition to the fundamental goal of achieving a bcs phase transition into pairing and superfluidity @xcite , research along these lines is also motivated by recent results that hint at the possibility to lower the phase noise in interferometric measurements below the bosonic standard quantum limit by using instead degenerate fermionic beams @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical discussions of fermionic nonlinear atom optics were presented in refs . @xcite and @xcite , which treated the case of a single ` test ' particle scattering off a periodic density grating formed by a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "they showed that for an appropriately prepared grating , the fermionic system can indeed undergo four - wave mixing .",
    "in contrast to the standard interpretation in terms of `` bosonic amplification '' , which clearly is not applicable to fermions , this effect was interpreted in terms of the constructive quantum interference between different paths leading to the same final state .",
    "one important aspect of the fermionic case is that , in contrast to bosons , considerable care must be taken in combining two matter waves to form a `` grating '' , so that their interaction with a third wave can produce a significant four - wave mixing signal .",
    "consider , as we shall do in this paper , counterpropagating matter waves separated in momentum by @xmath4 . in the case of bosons ,",
    "two obvious possibilities correspond to the states @xmath5    @xmath6^n|0\\rangle , \\ ] ] the @xmath7 being usual bosonic creation operators and @xmath8 the atomic vacuum .",
    "the fist case describes two counterpropagating beams of @xmath9 atoms each and of momenta @xmath10 , while the second state corresponds to a density grating obtained by identically preparing @xmath11 atoms in a coherent superposition of states of momenta @xmath12 .",
    "it is known from the study of atomic diffraction by optical fields that these two states lead to different diffraction patterns , because the first one contains `` which way '' information while the second does nt @xcite .",
    "this difference becomes however insignificant for large gratings .",
    "the situation for fermions is more complicated , since the pauli exclusion principle precludes one from placing more than one atom per state .",
    "one needs instead to consider multimode atomic beams , centered around the mean momenta @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the states @xmath13 and @xmath14 are replaced by @xmath15|0\\rangle\\ ] ] and @xmath16|0\\rangle , \\label{fermi - grating}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are fermionic creation operators for atoms of momenta in the vicinity of @xmath12 , the total number of atoms involved being indicated in the appropriate products . from refs .",
    "@xcite , we know that it is the quantum coherence apparent in matter - wave states of the form @xmath18 that is responsible for fermionic four - wave mixing . in order for the required quantum interference to occur , it is essential that every atom be in a coherent superposition of momentum states centered around @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "so far , our discussion has ignored the time dependence of the grating .",
    "but since the atoms forming a fermionic grating all have slightly different kinetic energies , their free evolution results in a dephasing that is expected to eventually lead to the disappearance of the four - wave mixing signal . although the importance of this dephasing was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , no quantitative discussion of its effect has been presented so far .",
    "the present paper addresses this problem quantitatively by a combined analytical and numerical study of the diffraction of a beam of fermionic atoms off a large fermionic grating .",
    "we fully include the dynamics of the atomic beam , but neglect its back - action on the grating dynamics , considering only its free evolution .",
    "this is the matter - wave analog of the undepleted pump approximation in nonlinear optics .",
    "section ii introduces our model and describes its dynamics in terms of equations of motion for particle - hole operators .",
    "the effect of the grating dynamics is characterized in terms of a dephasing time @xmath21 , whose impact is then illustrated in the simple case of raman - nath diffraction .",
    "the bragg regime is analyzed in section iii using a combination of an analytical discussion of a simple two - mode system and full numerical simulations .",
    "we determine the characteristic time scales governing this process , and conclude that four - wave mixing in degenerate fermi gases should barely be observable .",
    "noting that the dephasing of the grating is in principle reversible , we turn in section iv to a discussion of possible ways to achieve such a reversal , based on analogies with the photon echo techniques of quantum optics . since the physical origin of the dephasing is the difference in kinetic energies for atoms with different momenta , one elegant approach exploits the interaction of the grating with a periodic external potential to achieve a negative effective mass of the atoms .",
    "such methods pave the way for the observation of phenomena that seem out of experimental reach at first glance .",
    "finally , section v is a summary and outlook .",
    "a typical atomic four - wave mixing experiment involves three input wave packets that interact , typically via @xmath22-wave collisions , to produce a fourth packet in a new momentum state .",
    "physically , this can be interpreted as the result of the phase - matched scattering of one of the wave packets off the matter - wave grating produced by the superposition of the other two , as discussed in the introduction .    as is readily apparent from eq .",
    "( [ fermi - grating ] ) , though , a grating formed by @xmath11 fermions occupies @xmath23 momentum states , with @xmath11 states around the momentum @xmath19 and @xmath11 states near @xmath20 in our case . as a result of the free evolution associated with the spread in kinetic energies of these atoms , the density grating undergoes a dephasing , similar to doppler broadening in a thermal vapor .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of this dephasing and to determine to what extent it can be reduced , or even eliminated .",
    "we consider the situation of a spin - polarized fermionic beam diffracted by an atomic grating of spin - polarized fermions that are either of a different species or in a different spin state , see fig .",
    "[ model ] , the beam and grating atoms interacting coherently via elastic @xmath22-wave scattering .",
    "we neglect @xmath24-wave scattering , whose cross - section at zero temperature is orders of magnitude smaller than that of _ s_-wave scattering .",
    "the diffraction of a fermionic atomic beam by a periodic potential was previously treated for the case of free fermions ( or equivalently a one - dimensional bosonic tonks gas ) @xcite and of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "these treatments are restricted to the raman - nath regime , where the kinetic energies of the diffracted atoms are negligible compared to the potential energy of the grating .",
    "the scattering of two fermions by an optical standing wave was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . also worth mentioning in the present context is ref .",
    "@xcite , which investigates the nonlinear mixing of two bosonic and one fermionic wave . in these cases",
    "pauli blocking has a significant effect on the diffraction pattern , but as the gratings are non - fermionic , the dephasing , which is central to our work , is not addressed .",
    "we restrict the quantized description of the system to the dimension along the axis of the grating only , the `` transverse '' direction .",
    "the dynamics of the system in the direction perpendicular to it is treated classically , and parameterized by the time the atoms in the beam interact with the grating .",
    "note that this approximation neglects both the normal reflection and the bragg reflection of the incident beam off the grating @xcite .",
    "this model is described by the second - quantized hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the kinetic energy of a grating ( beam ) atom of mass @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and transverse momentum @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 is the reduced mass , @xmath33 is the @xmath22-wave scattering length characterizing the ultracold collisions between grating and beam atoms , @xmath34 is an effective transverse cross - sectional area , and @xmath35 is the quantization length .",

    "are easily found as @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "a similar equation holds for the grating particle - hole operators , with the substitution @xmath45 .",
    "we consider a beam of @xmath46 atoms propagating toward the grating with some central transverse momentum @xmath47 . as discussed in the introduction the grating is taken to be in a superposition of states of transverse momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the fermi momentum ( in one dimension ) and @xmath52 is the number of atoms forming the grating .",
    "such a grating can be prepared with two - photon bragg pulses of bandwidth larger than the fermi frequency @xmath53 in a two - step process starting from a stationary homogeneous gas , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in that scheme , a @xmath54-pulse imparting a transverse momentum @xmath55 to each atom in the static cloud",
    "is followed by a @xmath56 bragg pulse that creates the desired superposition state .",

    "( [ particleholefullequations ] ) . in this limit ,",
    "the grating simply undergoes a free evolution fully governed by its transverse kinetic energy .    assuming , consistently with the assumption of a large grating , that the expectation value of products of beam and grating particle - hole operators can be factorized as @xmath61 making explicit use of the grating initial condition ( [ initialvalues ] ) , and introducing the slowly varying particle - hole operators @xmath62,\\ ] ] and similarly for the grating , yields then the beam particle - hole heisenberg equations of motion    @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64,\\ ] ] reduces in the continuum limit , @xmath65 , to @xmath66 with @xmath67 . for times larger than the _ dephasing time _",
    "@xmath68 we have that @xmath69 , that is , the diffraction of the beam comes to a stop .",
    "this consequence of the dephasing between different momentum states of the atomic grating resulting from their free evolution , represents an essential difference between fermionic and bosonic four - wave mixing : the free evolution of a bosonic grating optically prepared from a bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature gives rise to a phase factor that can easily be transformed away . for fermions , though , it results in a dephasing and the effective shutting off of its interaction with the atomic beam .",
    "this impact of the dephasing is particularly easy to see in the raman - nath regime of atomic diffraction .",
    "we recall that this is the regime where the kinetic energy of the atoms in the beam is small compared to the potential energy of the density grating .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of a beam of fermions diffracted off a density grating formed by fermionic atoms in the limit of a large grating . an exact description of the system in terms of particle - hole operators is developed . </S>",
    "<S> we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to quantitatively explore the raman - nath and the bragg regimes of diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the limits in diffraction efficiency resulting from the dephasing of the grating due to the distribution of energy states occupied by the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we propose several methods to overcome these limits , including the novel technique of `` atom echoes '' . </S>"
