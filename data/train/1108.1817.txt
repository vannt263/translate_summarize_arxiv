    "the quest for spin - based quantum computation@xcite has led to a revival in the interest of the _ two - impurity kondo model _",
    "( tikm)@xcite , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 here @xmath2 represent two localized spins of magnitude @xmath3 , separated by a distance @xmath4 , and coupled to electronic spin densities @xmath5 via a kondo interaction of amplitude @xmath6 and to each other via an rkky interaction of amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons .",
    "the localized spins may be realized by two spinful quantum dots in a gated two - dimensional electron gas , with the rkky interaction mediated by the conduction electrons in an interjacent large quantum dot , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a microscopic length ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as shown in an experiment by craig _",
    "et al._@xcite , the rkky coupling can be controlled by adjusting the voltage on an external gate . with the two spin states on each dot representing a qubit",
    ", this suggests a means to emulate a _ two - qubit gate_@xcite .",
    "a key issue is how robust the rkky coupling is against competing interactions .",
    "in particular , the lack of inversion symmetry in a quantum well implies the presence of spin - orbit interactions@xcite that may modify the simple isotropic rkky interaction in ( [ 2impk ] ) .",
    "as the isotropy of a spin - spin interaction ( _ alias _ the coupling between qubits ) is a highly desirable feature when designing a two - qubit gate@xcite , one is faced with the problem of engineering an _ isotropic spin - orbit modified rkky interaction_. is this possible ?",
    "this is the question we shall address in the first part of this article .    the model in eq .",
    "( [ 2impk ] ) is also interesting at a more fundamental level as it is known to exhibit a quantum phase transition driven by the competition between the rkky and kondo interactions@xcite .",
    "adding spin - orbit interactions , this leads to a second question : how do these interactions influence the critical behavior of the model ?",
    "in the second part of the paper we show how to arrive at an answer via boundary conformal field theory ( bcft)@xcite . a fine tuned spin - orbit interaction is found to produce an irrelevant perturbation of the fixed point hamiltonian ( in the language of the renormalization group ) , and we shall uncover how this perturbation is encoded in corrections to the block entanglement scaling at criticality .",
    "spin - orbit interactions in a quantum well come in two brands , the _ dresselhaus interaction_@xcite due to breaking of the inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice , @xmath11 and the gate - controllable _ rashba interaction_@xcite coming from the two - dimensional confinement of the electrons , @xmath12 the amplitude ratio @xmath13 depends on the material as well as the design and the gate bias of the particular semiconductor heterostructure which supports the quantum well , with @xmath13 ranging from order unity in a typical gaas / algaas device to @xmath14 for hgte / cdte@xcite . following imamura _",

    "to find out whether there are any finite values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for which spin - rotational invariance may be recovered , it is useful to rotate the coordinate system by an angle @xmath28 around the @xmath29-axis .",
    "the spin - orbit modified rkky interaction then takes the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 , and @xmath32 parameterized by @xmath33 and @xmath4 .",
    "the ising and dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) terms in ( [ rkkyinter ] ) can be traced back to a term in the green s function @xmath34 in ( [ pert ] ) which contains a factor @xmath35 , with @xmath36 a matrix with elements @xmath37 . in the rotated coordinate system",
    "one has that @xmath38 and it follows from ( [ rkkyinter ] ) that the rkky interaction becomes manifestly spin - rotational invariant when @xmath39 .",
    "our result boosts the proposal in ref .",
    "3 that an rkky - coupled double - quantum dot device can be used as a building block of a two - qubit gate , _ also in the realistic case with spin - orbit interactions included_. anisotropic terms in a pulsed spin exchange used in a two - qubit gate are well - known to be a nuisance , as they tend to mix different spin states , implying a slow - down of the switching time@xcite .",
    "while various schemes to get around or reduce this problem have been proposed@xcite , the ideal two - qubit gate is patterned upon an isotropic exchange .",
    "as revealed by our results , this situation should in principle be possible to achieve experimentally in a gaas or inas quantum well where the rashba coupling @xmath26 is of comparable strength to that of @xmath27 and can be fine - tuned by an external gate voltage .",
    "equal strengths of the rashba and dresselhaus interactions have been found to restore also a type of `` hidden '' su(2 ) symmetry in a 2d electron gas , predicted to produce a _ persistent spin helix _ @xmath0 a helical spin density wave of infinite lifetime@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore whether there is a connection between this finding and that of ours for the rkky interaction .",
    "for related work on implications of equal strengths of dresselhaus and rashba couplings , see refs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "the results in the previous section are valid only when the direct kondo interactions in ( [ 2impk ] ) are dominated by the rkky term , i.e. when @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the energy scale ( `` kondo temperature '' ) below which kondo screening sets in@xcite . by tuning the gate",
    "voltages so that @xmath41 becomes larger than @xmath7 one passes into a _",
    "kondo phase _ where the two localized spins are completely screened .",
    "when the electrons that mediate the rkky interaction are separated from those that participate in the kondo screening , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition with a non - fermi liquid quantum critical point@xcite .",
    "the condition of electron separation can be realized in the laboratory by using a setup as in fig .",
    "2 . by proper gating",
    ", the electrons in the central dot are made to mediate an rkky interaction only , with the external leads providing for the possible kondo screening channels.@xcite as shown by affleck _",
    "et al._@xcite , an efficient way to characterize the quantum critical behavior of the system is to use a bcft approach .",
    "its extension to the case with dresselhaus and rashba interactions included in the external leads meets with some technical difficulties , however , connected to the fact that there is now an intertwined sequence of orbital angular modes coupling to the localized spins .",
    "to handle this situation one needs some powerful scheme , with details still to be worked out@xcite .",
    "however , when only _",
    "one _ type of spin - orbit interaction in the external leads is present ( i.e. dresselhaus _ or _ rashba , but as before allowing for both types of interactions to be simultaneously present in the central dot ) , the bcft approach still delivers very effectively . for this case",
    "the individual spin - orbit interactions connect only two angular momentum modes to the kondo coupled s - wave component of the electron fields , thus simplifying matters dramatically@xcite .    in order to apply the bcft machinery it is convenient to first rotate the localized spin on _ one _ of the dots , @xmath42 , followed by the same rotation of the electron spins in the lead connected to this dot , @xmath43 . by a judicious choice of twist angle @xmath44 ( for details ,",
    "9 ) , the full _ spin - orbit modified tikm _ can be cast on the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are parameterized by @xmath48 and @xmath44 , and where , for simplicity , we have chosen @xmath49 . when @xmath50 we recover the ordinary tikm in ( [ 2impk ] ) , and for this case the critical behavior is therefore the same for all twist angles @xmath44 .",
    "the case where there is no twist , but an ising anisotropy , @xmath51 , is a bit different .",
    "now the su(2 ) symmetry of the theory is broken down to u(1 ) .",
    "we know from ref .",
    "6 that anisotropies in the kondo interaction do not change the leading scaling behavior at criticality .",
    "now , whether the symmetry breaking is due to an anisotropy in the kondo exchange , or , as in ( [ sotikm ] ) , in the rkky interaction , is immaterial since the bcft operator content which governs the critical behavior depends only on the overall left - over symmetry .",
    "one may thus be tempted to conclude that the renormalization - group fixed point that governs the critical theory is stable also against an ising anisotropy in the rkky interaction .",
    "however , this line of argument would be too fast : changing the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 by the _",
    "same _ amount is in fact a relevant perturbation , taking the scaling hamiltonian away from the fixed point along an su(2)-invariant direction . given the linearized rg flow around the fixed point , the irrelevant direction is perpendicular to the su(2 ) invariant line , and thus , only by fine - tuning the parameters by letting @xmath52 and @xmath53 will we stay at the fixed point . since the fixed points for",
    "all values of the twist @xmath44 arise from the same hamiltonian and should thus be identified , it follows that the general case with both a twist _ and _ an ising anisotropy is the same as that with no twist . in other words , the tikm fixed point is stable under perturbations of spin - orbit interactions provided that one tunes the parameters judiciously , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "else one flows towards one of the stable fixed points representing the rkky phase and the kondo screened phase , respectively ( see fig .",
    "when considering proposals for quantum information processing using rkky - coupled spins@xcite , it becomes interesting to quantify the entanglement between the two spins as measured by the _",
    "this was done by cho and mckenzie@xcite who also showed that the concurrence vanishes identically at the critical point and thus serves as a marker for the quantum phase transition .",
    "this result remains valid in the presence of spin - orbit interactions@xcite .",
    "another entanglement measure with interesting scaling behavior at a quantum phase transition is the _ block entanglement_@xcite . for a system in a pure state and partitioned into two parts @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the block entanglement is encoded by the _ von neumann entropy _ @xmath56 of the reduced density matrix @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 ) .",
    "the contribution to @xmath59 coming from the impurity spins in the tikm hamiltonian in ( [ 2impk ] ) is given by the _",
    "boundary entropy _",
    "@xmath60 at the nontrivial fixed point @xcite .",
    "since the critical properties of the spin - orbit modified tikm in ( [ sotikm ] ) are controlled by the same fixed point as for the tikm without spin - orbit interactions , it follows that the boundary entropy stays the same . to uncover the presence of the spin - orbit interactions in",
    "( [ dresselhaus ] ) and ( [ rashba ] ) one must study the corrections to @xmath61 implied by the enlarged content of rg - irrelevant operators due to the breaking of su(2 ) @xmath62 u(1 ) when @xmath63 .",
    "a symmetry analysis suggests that the boundary operator corresponding to the irrelevant rg flow in fig .",
    "3 can be identified as a component of the energy - momentum tensor , with scaling dimension @xmath64 . by employing a formalism developed by cardy and calabrese for calculating corrections to the critical von neumann entropy@xcite , recently adapted to the case of _ boundary perturbations_@xcite , we then infer that @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are dimensionless constants , @xmath68 is the _ kondo screening length_,@xcite and where @xmath69 is the length of the block , with @xmath70 being the distance between the dots ( see fig .",
    "higher - order corrections are denoted by @xmath71 . here",
    "the @xmath72 term is produced by the _",
    "leading _ irrelevant boundary operator of dimension @xmath73 , with the second term in the parenthesis contributed precisely by an @xmath64 operator .",
    "it is important to point out that a @xmath74-term appears also for the tikm in ( [ 2impk ] ) with no spin - orbit interactions , due to the fact that the _ full _ energy - momentum tensor is part of _ any _ scaling hamiltonian .",
    "thus , to leading order , the presence of the spin - orbit interactions is revealed only by a change of the amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eq .",
