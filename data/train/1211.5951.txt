    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "these two effects are reflected in eq .  2 in the main text .",
    "the convenience of the bosonization approach is in the fact that the hamiltonian of interacting 1d electrons is quadratic in terms of the boson fields and can be easily diagonalized .",

    "the new plasmon operators @xmath183 have a simple physical meaning : they create and annihilate charge and dipole plasmon excitations with the wave vector @xmath159 .",

    "thus , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , the excitations created by electron tunneling acquire the following phase from zero modes ( restoring physical units and setting @xmath190 ) @xmath191 which explains eq .  5 in the main text .",

    "the similar contribution from the lower arm of the interferometer has been omitted for the sake of simplicity of the argument .",
    "the complication in the next step arises because each electron operator on the right hand side of ( [ eq9 ] ) generates an infinite number of terms , when expanded in the plasmon operators , which can be schematically expressed as following : @xmath195 , where @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the plasmon correlation functions for the sets of wave numbers @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
