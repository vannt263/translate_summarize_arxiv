    "this contribution considers the problem of constructing detectors appropriate for doing short - baseline neutrino physics at the first muon collider complex .",
    "the physics motivations for these detectors are discussed elsewhere in these proceedings@xcite .",
    "since the proposed experiments are short - baseline , the physics being considered is primarily the high - energy physics of neutrino - nucleon deep - inelastic scattering ; however , the final section of the paper considers an oscillation experiment possible with the lowest energy neutrino beam .",
    "the muon collider is expected to use a series of recirculating linacs to accelerate the muons before injection into a collider ring .",
    "any segment along the muon s trajectory that is straight will necessarily create a collimated neutrino beam with an angular divergence of approximately @xmath0 .",
    "the recirculating linacs ( rlas ) will have @xmath1 in which acceleration takes place , and the interaction points in the collider rings will also have @xmath2-@xmath3 m straight sections .",
    "we wrote a simple monte carlo of the muon collider straight sections to predict fluxes , based on the workshop muon accelerator parameters .",
    "we used the @xmath4 beam , and assumed the beam polarization and divergence were zero .",
    "fluxes were predicted far downstream of each straight section in order to allow for shielding .",
    "we considered only a `` dumb '' shield option in which sufficient concrete shielding to range out the muons from the primary muon beam was used .",
    "table [ tab : flux ] gives a table of the distances of a proposed experiment downstream of each straight section in the rlas and collider .",
    ".for each straight section in the rlas and for several different collider scenarios , the maximum muon energy , the required shielding distance , the @xmath5 beam size and the @xmath5 dis events in millions per g/@xmath6/yr are shown .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the fluxes detailed above represent improvements by @xmath7 to @xmath2 orders of magnitude over contemporary high energy neutrino beams  events / kg / yr with a mean energy of @xmath8  gev@xcite ; beams at the cern ps used by nomad and chorus had a mean energy of @xmath9  gev and observed @xmath10  events / kg / yr@xcite . ]",
    ". it would therefore be possible to run an experiment with conventional high - mass sampling target - calorimeters and observe perhaps @xmath11 events per year in previously explored energy regimes .    =    however , sampling calorimeters would have some difficulties in the fmc environment .",
    "high mass sampling calorimeters are only designed for the detection of  or  since  and  events are difficult to separate from neutral current interactions of other neutrino species , especially when the final state lepton has a low fraction of the initial neutrino energy . therefore , unless the muon beam polarity of the fmc were reversible , only neutrinos or anti - neutrinos could be observed in a single detector .",
    "furthermore , high mass , sparsely instrumented detectors are sensitive to pile - up . as per pulse event rates in table  [ tab : backg - pp ] show , this is a particular concern downstream of the high - energy recirculating linacs where the beam is concentrated in time in a relatively small number of turns .",
    "figure  [ fig : nutev - pileup ] shows an extreme illustration of the difficulties of dealing with pile - up in a sample - calorimeter .",
    "assuming these difficulties could somehow be overcome , it is also unclear what the novel physics available from @xmath11 neutrino interactions in dense material would be . in general ,",
    "precision measurements from neutrinos are systematics limited in such detectors@xcite and @xmath12@xcite in the ccfr experiment ] and searches for rare phenomena are background limited .",
    "= 0.5    probably more interesting than the above detector technology would be one where the target is small enough to vary its composition for studies of nuclear effects on nucleon structure or even spin physics in neutrino deep inelastic scattering .",
    "this is possible in a geometry more closely resembling traditional fixed - target experiments : target , followed by spectrometry and calorimetry and muon identification as shown in figure  [ fig : ft - schematic ] .",
    "the problems of tracking , particle - id and calorimetry in such detectors are well - known and will not be discussed here .",
    "such a detector would presumably be able to identify the outgoing lepton in charged - current events , possibly with trds in the downstream tracking providing enhanced identification",
    ". this detector would be able to tag the production of charmed particles by observing high momentum final state leptons , and with a sufficiently fine - grained upstream tracker , charmed final state particles could be tagged _ via _ detached vertices@xcite .",
    "physics goals of an experiment using this detector are described elsewhere in these proceedings@xcite .",
    "the most serious technical difficulties of such detectors is pile - up in the dense calorimetry and muon systems . a typical iron - scintillator sampling calorimeter / muon shield of @xmath13 ( @xmath14  m of steel or @xmath15  kg/@xmath6 )",
    "would observe the per pulse background rates shown in table  [ tab : backg - pp ] .",
    "background rates at the collider are probably manageable , but the background rates at the rlas , particularly rla3 , could be difficult .",
    "=    =    another avenue that becomes possible with the fmc neutrino beams is searching for neutrino oscillations in a modest - sized experiment . figure  [ fig : rla1-qe ] shows the expected energy spectrum of quasi - elastic  events downstream of rla1 . in a water - density 0.05m@xmath16 target",
    ", one would expect to observe approximately @xmath17  million events per year .",
    "this sets the scale for a truly `` table - top '' scale neutrino oscillation experiment .    with a flavor selected beam of  and , the simplest search experimentally appearance is background - laden at these energies and @xmath18 appearance , aside from being heavily suppressed by @xmath19 , requires a more sophisticated detector . ]",
    "is for wrong - sign muon ( @xmath4 ) appearance .",
    "the primary backgrounds would come from mis - identifying the muon charge or from production of charged pions which could decay or be misidentified as muons . by",
    "conclusively identifying @xmath20 charge in a spectrometer , tracking the particle from the point of appearance and observing its decay with a characteristic muon lifetime , these backgrounds could presumably be kept very low . a naive version of a detector designed for this measurement appears in figure  [ fig : table - top - det ] . with proper granuality of tracking and careful optimization of the magnetic field for a broad acceptance in momentum",
    ", even such a small scale detector could reach @xmath21 sensitivity if naive background estimations are correct .",
    "we have presented outlines of detector designs for short - baseline neutrino experiments at the first muon collider complex .",
    "this facility would make available neutrino beams of unprecedented intensity , and we argue that the best way to take advantage of this is to design novel detectors , such as small targets or `` table - top '' neutrino experiments to explore different aspects of neutrino scattering or neutrino oscillations than those studied in the past .",
