    "recently we have seen a good deal of interest in the calculation of hadronic current correlation functions at finite temperature using lattice simulations of qcd [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "the procedure involves the calculation of the correlation function in euclidean space and the application of a generalized laplace transform to obtain the spectral functions .",
    "various temperature - dependent resonant structures are found in the spectral functions .",
    "it is of interest to obtain further understanding of the nature of these resonances using chiral lagrangian models , such as that of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model [ 6 ] , that are successful in reproducing some of the low - energy properties of qcd .",
    "we have made some calculations of spectral functions making use of a generalized nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio model [ 7 ] .",
    "in that work we studied correlators for currents with the quantum numbers of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 mesons . in the present work",
    "we extend our study to the pseudoscalar - isoscalar correlators . in this case",
    "the correlators are calculated in terms of excitations that have the quantum numbers of the @xmath3 mesons .",
    "one of our goals in the present study is to relate the pseudoscalar - isoscalar spectral functions to the properties of the @xmath3 mesons at finite temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the spectrum of the eta mesons is obtained using our generalized njl model which includes a covariant model of confinement [ 8 - 13 ] . at zero temperature",
    "our model provides an excellent fit to the properties of the @xmath3(547 ) , @xmath9(958 ) mesons and their radial excitations [ 12 ] .",
    "( the model gives quite satisfactory results for the decay constants and mixing angles of the @xmath3 and @xmath9 mesons . ) in order to obtain the spectrum of the eta mesons at finite temperature , we make some assumptions which lead to relatively simple calculations . for example",
    ", we use temperature - dependent mass values for the constituent quarks obtained in a mean - field analysis and also introduce a temperature - dependent confining interaction that is motivated by some recent results obtained in lattice simulations of qcd with dynamical quarks . in addition , we have introduced a temperature dependence of the coupling constants of the njl model . our original motivation for introducing that temperature dependence was to model the various physical mechanisms that work against the development of pion condensation [ 14 ] .",
    "however , in the present work we argue that , if the njl model is to be used at high temperatures , such temperature dependence is needed to avoid results that are inconsistent with what is known about qcd thermodynamics . for our studies",
    "we have introduced coupling constants @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the temperature of the confinement - deconfinement transition , which we take to be @xmath2 mev . at that temperature the coupling constants",
    "are reduced by 17% .",
    "the coupling constants are equal to zero beyond @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we see that in this model the short - range interaction is present in the range 0 @xmath12 5.88@xmath1 , while the confining interaction is taken to vanish for @xmath13 .",
    "that feature of the model is also consistent with what is known concerning qcd thermodynamics .    ideally , it would be preferable if we could calculate the temperature - dependent spectrum of the @xmath3 mesons , including the radial excitations , in the imaginary - time matsubara formalism or in the real - time finite - temperature formalism [ 15 , 16 ] .",
    "that is a formidable task which is beyond the scope of the present work , but might be considered at some future time .",
    "( on the whole , there are some unresolved questions concerning the use of the field - theoretic finite - temperature theory in the confined phase of qcd which are not present when considering the deconfined phase . ) in those cases in which our results may be compared to those of the matsubara formalism we find general agreement [ 17 ] .",
    "however , we need to assume for the present work that , with the use of temperature - dependent constituent quark mass values , a temperature - dependent confining interaction and temperature - dependent coupling constants , we have introduced the most important features that influence the @xmath3 spectrum for @xmath4 .",
    "the organization of our work is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the calculation of polarization functions of the njl model at finite temperature . in section iii",
    "we describe the calculation of the pseudoscalar - isoscalar hadronic current correlation functions and present various results of our numerical computations .",
    "since the use of temperature - dependent coupling constants is an unusual feature of our model , we provide some justification for the use of such coupling constants in section iv . in section",
    "v we introduce the lagrangian of our model that is used for our rpa calculations .",
    "we make reference to the rpa equations that were used to calculate the properties of the @xmath3 mesons at @xmath14 in earlier work and describe the motivation for the introduction of a temperature - dependent confining interaction .",
    "we present some results of our numerical calculations and relate the results of our rpa calculations for @xmath4 to the results obtained for the correlation functions for @xmath15 .",
    "finally , section vi contains some further discussion and conclusions .",
    "in an earlier work we carried out a euclidean - space calculation of the up , down , and strange constituent quark masses taking into account the t hooft interaction and our confining interaction [ 18 ] .",
    "the t hooft interaction plays only a minor role , but does provide coupling of the equations for the various constituent masses . if we neglect the confining interaction and the t hooft interaction in the mean field calculation of the constituent masses , we can compensate for their absence by making a modest change in the value of @xmath16 , the coupling constant of the njl model . for the calculations of this work we calculate the quark masses using the formalism presented in the klevansky review [ 19 ] .",
    "( note that our value of @xmath16 is twice the value of @xmath17 used in that review . )",
    "the relevant equation is eq .",

    ", we put @xmath18 and write m(t)=m^0 + 4gn_c_0^dp(1 2e_p),where @xmath19 gev is a cutoff for the momentum integral , @xmath20 and @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] . in our calculations",
