    "it seems that after about eighty years on theories of diffraction from periodic structures everything should have been said and done .",
    "this is even more true since _ moharam _ and _ gaylord _ in a series of papers published a rigorous theory of diffraction ( rigorous coupled wave analysis , rcwa ) , which covers nearly the entire scope of cases that have ever been relevant @xcite .",
    "however , for practical purposes approximate theories are still around , which are used instead . while the optics community has strongly opted for the coupled - wave approach of _ kogelnik _ ( k - vector closure method , kvcm ) @xcite and much less for the one introduced by _",
    "( beta - value method , bvm ) @xcite , the neutron and x - ray communities are using solely the dynamical theory of diffraction ( ddt ) @xcite or _",
    "darwin s _ early variant @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the discussion on diffraction theories for volume gratings might sound outworn , we will show that it is possible to experimentally single out a set of analytic theories which is significantly superior to others .",
    "we identified three problems in the theories when treating the off - bragg regime : the first is , that the kvcm misses to correctly account for energy conservation , the second is that kvcm and bvm only treat the half - space case , i.e. , a single boundary .",
    "thus boundary conditions for a parallel slab are not properly included and yield an ambiguity .",
    "finally , with the ddt , which in principle yields the exact solution to the wave equation , typically an approximation of the dispersion surface for small off - bragg conditions is performed in literature @xcite , which leads to hyperbolic dispersion surfaces and is called hyperbolic approximation in what follows .",
    "it is stated by _",
    "syms and solymar _ that the differences between the amplitudes derived from each of the theories are small @xcite .",
    "however , for geometrically thin gratings with large coupling coefficients as for our samples deviations in the far - off - bragg regime are observable .",
    "the result of this work is that the first order two - wave coupling theory employing the bvm as well as the ddt @xcite fit the experimental data extremely well , provided that we refrain from using the hyperbolic approximation for the latter .",
    "the kvcm fits the experimental data much worse .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with a derivation of the relevant equations for the two - wave coupling theories kvcm and bvm as well as for the modal ddt without the hyperbolic approximation",
    ". then the experiment and the corresponding results are shown together with fits to each of the theories .",
    "we also compare the theories using proper approximations , discuss the implications and end with a conclusion .",
    "in what follows we summarize the different approaches to solve the wave equation for sinusoidal transmission volume gratings and give the results for the diffraction amplitudes with a particular emphasis on the far - off - bragg regime , which is subject to our experiments .",
    "we start with the simplest set of assumptions .",
    "space is divided into three distinct regions : the input region ( free space ) , the grating region ( periodic material ) , and the output region ( free space ) .",
    "a sketch of the geometry is provided in fig .",

    "thus it can be described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean refractive index of the material under investigation , @xmath3 the refractive - index modulation and @xmath4 the spatial frequency of the grating .",
    "the scalar wave equation ( helmholtz equation ) , for the polarization state perpendicular to the plane of incidence ( @xmath5 or h mode polarization ) in such a medium is @xmath6e(x , z)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 with @xmath8 the free space wavelength of light and @xmath9 the normalized electric field amplitude .",
    "it was shown that an exact solution of the wave equation can be obtained by solving an infinite number of coupled linear differential equations of first order under appropriate boundary conditions @xcite ( rcwa ) . in the rigorous treatment of the problem",
    "the coupled wave analysis and the modal approach are completely equivalent , i.e. , lead to identical results @xcite . for thick volume holograms discussed here",
    "only two diffracted beams of considerable field amplitudes exist at the same time , e.g. , the first and zeroth diffraction order @xcite .",
    "in addition , the amplitudes strongly depend on how well the bragg condition , @xmath10 , is fulfilled . here",
    "@xmath11 is the bragg angle and @xmath12 the propagation constant in the material",
    ". a commonly defined off - bragg parameter @xcite is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle of incidence .",
    "our interest is to compare three common diffraction theories with experimental data obtained for a wide range of angles , particularly in the far - off - bragg regime .",
    "in contrast , usually only the very vicinity of the bragg peak is considered and a linearization of @xmath15 is performed ( see also appendix [ app:2 ] ) , a simplification which is not applicable in our case . in what follows",
    "we give the relevant equations for each of the three theories that cover also the far - off - bragg regime .",
    "the basic idea of kogelnik s coupled wave approach is to solve eq .",

    "( [ eq : solansatz ] ) ( slowly varying envelope approximation ) .",
    "this simplifies the system of differential equations to first order on the expense that the boundary conditions are to some extent ambiguous ( we end up with a half - space case instead of a slab , i.e. , the output region is not considered ) . coupling of the waves arises via the bragg condition , which relates the wavevector @xmath18 of the diffracted beam to the wavevector @xmath19 of the forward diffracted - frequently called also transmitted - beam . at this point _",

    "( [ eq : deuchida ] ) to the angular dependence of the diffraction efficiency shown in fig .",

    "the discrepancy to the value determined in the present work originates from three facts : ( i ) here we used experimentally measured values weighted by their standard error of the mean ( no weighting in @xcite ) , ( ii ) the angular range was extended to the far - off - bragg region which has particular influence on the obtained thickness via the phase function through its minima , and ( iii ) the background was thoroughly subtracted . browsing through the literature of evaluating the refractive - index modulation of volume holographic gratings",

    "our experiment and the sample under investigation provide almost ideal conditions , i.e. , the assumptions about the grating taken in the models are fulfilled .",

    "however , when it comes to less perfect gratings , e.g. , taper with an attenuation of the grating modulation along the sample depth @xcite due , for example , to non - neglible linear absorption during recording @xcite , there is no known way to apply the modal approach that leads to the ddt .",
    "in contrast , it has been successfully proven that the problem can even be analytically treated using a coupled wave analysis @xcite .",
    "diffraction by a one dimensional volume holographic grating with a relatively thick film ( about 57 micron ) and high refractive- index modulation ( @xmath3 about @xmath75 ) allows to demonstrate a significant difference between diffraction theories .",
    "for now we conclude , that both coupled wave approaches , kvcm and bvm , and the corresponding differential equations are approximations to the ddt . while the kvcm fails to give the correct phase function for the diffraction efficiency , the bvm differs by a factor @xmath76 in the amplitude .",
