    "these are extensions to the sm which predicts a new symmetry between bosons and fermions .",
    "this theory has several advantages over the sm such as the introduction of a dark matter candidate , a solution to the hierarchy problem and the potential for gut scale unification . in its simplest form",

    "the decays of charged higgs depends on both the model considered and the mass range predicted .",
    "various scenarios have been studied at both d0 and cdf , for non - extended two higgs doublet models , such as the mssm , the charged higgs is expected to couple strongest to the top quark .",
    "therefore analysis studied can be separated in cases where the charged higgs is lighter than the top quark and where it is more massive .      for the case where the mass of the charged higgs is smaller than the mass of the top quark , the production of a charged higgs at the tevatron will be via @xmath6 .",
    "the charged higgs can either decay leptonically , hadronically or to a mixed hadron lepton final state .",
    "this additional decay of the top quark will compete with the sm process @xmath7 .",
    "due to the different decays of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 a search for the charged higgs can be preformed by looking at a difference in the distributions of events between the final states as compared to what is predicted by the standard model .",

    "this is the same final state as the standard model process @xmath17 therefore the rate of single top production at the tevatron compared to that predicted by the sm would be effected and a bump would be expected in the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath16 final state .",

    "all the model independent limits are determined for both and right- and left - handed higgs .",
    "this analysis starts with the identification of muons and hadronic taus are identified . for a reconstructed muon ,",
    "hits in the muon chambers are matched to tracks in the central tracking chambers , these are then required to be isolated in both the calorimeters and the central tracking detectors .",
    "hadronic tau decays are first split into three types based on the energy clusters in the calorimeters and the number of tracks .",
    "type 1 and 2 are 1-prong decays with energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter ( type 1 ) or in both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters ( type 2 ) .",
    "type 3 taus are 3-prong decays with an invariant mass below 1.7 gev and energy deposits in the calorimeters . for each of the different types a neural network , nn ,",
    "is trained using @xmath43 decays as signal and multijet events predicted from data as background , to separate hadronic tau decays from jets .",
    "events are required to have two hadronic taus , @xmath44 , and at least one isolated muon .",

    "the sum of the charges of the highest @xmath28 muon and the two highest @xmath28 taus is required to be @xmath53 , as is expected for signal .",
    "after application of the described cuts , the main backgrounds contributions are from diboson and @xmath43 processes , with smaller contributions arising from @xmath54 , @xmath55+jets , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "for all mc samples geant  @xcite is used to correct for detector effects .",
    "the contribution due to multijet background is determined to be negligible .    to enhance the discrimination of the signal sample over the background the selected events are split into four different samples .",
    "these are based on the number of tau and muons in the final state and the charged correlation between the the two taus . for two samples",
    "it is required that there is exactly two taus and one muon and these are split further depending on whether the charges of the two taus are the same or opposite .",
    "the other two samples require exactly 3 taus and 1 muon or exactly 2 taus and 2 muons .",
    "the invariant mass of the two highest @xmath28 candidates for the two samples with exactly 2 taus and 1 muon are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the four different samples are dominated by different background processes hence splitting improves the sensitivity to the signal .",
