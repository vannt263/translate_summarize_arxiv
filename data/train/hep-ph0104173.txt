    "doubly heavy baryons take the special place among baryons which contain heavy quarks .",
    "the existence of two heavy quarks causes the brightly expressed quark - diquark structure of the @xmath1 baryon , in a wave function which one s the configuration with compact heavy @xmath6-diquark dominates .",
    "regularity in a spectrum of mass of doubly heavy baryons appear in many respects to a similar case of mesons containing one heavy quark @xcite .",
    "production mechanisms for @xmath7-baryons and @xmath8-mesons also have common features . at the first stage compact heavy @xmath6-diquark",
    "is formed , than it fragments in a final @xmath7-baryon , picking up a light quark .",
    "the calculations of production cross sections for doubly heavy baryons in @xmath9- and @xmath10-interactions were made recently as in the model of a hard fragmentation of a heavy quark in doubly heavy diquark @xcite as within the framework of the model of precise calculation of cross section of a gluon ",
    "gluon fusion into doubly heavy diquarks and two heavy antiquarks in the leading order of the perturbation theory of qcd @xcite .",
    "mechanism of production of hadrons containing charmed quarks , based on consideration of hard parton subprocesses with one @xmath3-quark in an initial state , was discussed earlier in papers @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that in the region of a large transferred momentum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is charmed quark mass ) the concept of a charm excitation in a hadron does not contradict parton model and allows to effectively take into account the contribution of the high orders of the perturbative qcd theory to the born approximation . however , there is open problem of the `` double score '' , which is determined by the fact that the part of the born diagrams of birth of two heavy quarks in a gluon - gluon fusion can be interpreted , as the diagrams with charm excitation in one of initial protons .",
    "these diagrams give leading in @xmath13 contribution in the @xmath3-quark perturbative , so - called point - like structure function ( sf ) of a proton .",
    "as to the non - perturbative contribution in @xmath14quark sf of a proton @xcite it does not depend from @xmath15 and becomes very small at @xmath16 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1 shows one of 36 born diagrams , which have order @xmath17 , describing production of the @xmath2-diquark in the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess .",
    "the experience in calculation of heavy quark production cross sections in a gluon - gluon fusion demonstrates that the contribution of the next order of the perturbative qcd in @xmath18 can be comparable with the contribution of the born diagrams . in the case of gluon  gluon production of the two pairs of heavy quarks there will be more than three hundred diagrams with additional gluon in the final state , which have order @xmath19 , and their direct calculation is now considered difficultly feasible .",
    "in this paper the model of @xmath2-diquark production in proton - proton interactions , based on the mechanism of the charm excitation in a proton is considered .",
    "it is supposed , that the @xmath2-diquark is formed during scattering of @xmath3-quarks from colliding protons with radiation of a hard gluon , i.e. in the parton subprocess : @xmath21 the feynman diagrams of the parton subprocess ( 1 ) are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are 4-momenta of the initial @xmath3-quarks , @xmath24 is 4-momentum of the final gluon , @xmath25 is 4-momentum of the diquark , which one is divided equally between the final @xmath3-quarks .",
    "the doubly heavy diquark is considered as bound state of two @xmath3-quarks in the antitriplet colour state and in the vector spin state .",
    "if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are colour indexes of initial quarks , and @xmath28 is colour index of a final diquark , the amplitude of production of the @xmath2-diquark @xmath29 is connected with the amplitude of production of two @xmath3-quarks with 4-momenta @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the diquark mass , @xmath34 is the diquark wave function in zero point , @xmath35 is the colour part of a diquark wave function . considering spin degrees of freedom of @xmath14quarks and @xmath2-diquark ,",
    "we have following conformity between amplitudes of birth of free quarks and a diquark with fixed spin projections ( without colour indexes and common factor @xmath36 ) : @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the wave function of the @xmath2-diquark is antisymmetric on colour index and symmetric on remaining indexes , the production of the scalar @xmath2-diquark is forbidden , i.e. @xmath38 amplitudes adequate to the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 , where the final c - quarks are in the arbitrary spin states , are written out below , without the colour factors and the common factor @xmath36 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath13 is strong coupling constant , @xmath41 .",
    "let s remark , that the amplitudes @xmath42 are received by replacement of the initial quarks momenta @xmath43 in the amplitudes @xmath44 ans are taken with a minus sign , that allows for the antisymmetrization of the initial state of two identical @xmath3-quarks .",
    "the corresponding colour factors are presented by the following expressions : @xmath45 using known property of a completely antisymmetric tensor of the third rank @xmath46 it is easy to find products of the colour factors @xmath47 , which ones are presented in the appendix a. the method of the calculation of a production amplitude of a bound nonrelativistic state of quarks in the fixed spin state is based on a formalism of the projection operator @xcite .",
    "using properties of the charge conjugation matrix @xmath48 , we can link a scattering amplitude of a quark on a quark with a scattering amplitude of an antiquark on a quark , for example : @xmath49 as it may be shown , at @xmath50 one has : @xmath51 \\sim \\hat\\varepsilon ( p , s_z=0)(\\hat p+m_{cc}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52  is polarization 4-vector of a spin-1 particle . after following effective replacements @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , amplitudes @xmath56 , with corresponding colour factors @xmath57 , describe production of the @xmath2-diquark with fixed polarization .",
    "the square of the module of amplitude of @xmath2-diquark production after average on spin and colour degrees of freedom is given by the following expression : @xmath58 where in the amplitudes @xmath56 we have put @xmath59 . the summation on vector diquark polarizations in the square of the amplitude of the process ( 1 )",
    "was done using the standard formula : @xmath60 the calculation of the value @xmath61 have been executed using the package of an analytical calculations feyncalc @xcite .",
    "the answer is shown in the appendix b , as a function of standard mandelstam variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "in the parton model the cross section of a @xmath2-diquark production in @xmath10-interactions is represented as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 is the @xmath3-quark distribution function in a proton at @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the diquark transverse momentum , @xmath70 is the rapidity of the diquark in c.m.f . of colliding protons ,",
    "@xmath71    it is supposed that spin-@xmath72 and spin-@xmath73 @xmath74baryons relative yield is @xmath75 as it is predicted by the simple counting rule for the spin states .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath1-baryons plus @xmath76baryons in our approach is connected with the production cross section of @xmath2-diquark within the framework of a model of a non - perturbative fragmentation as follows : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the phenomenological function of a fragmentation , normalized approximately on unity , as a total probability of transition @xmath2-diquark in final doubly charmed baryon . at @xmath79 the fragmentation function",
    "is selected in the standard form @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath1-baryon mass , @xmath82 is the light quark mass , @xmath83 the is rate - fixing constant .",
    "the fragmentation function for @xmath84 can be determined by the solving the dglap evolution equation @xcite .",
    "following to paper @xcite , at numerical calculations we have used following values of parameters : @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 , @xmath87 gev@xmath88 , @xmath89 gev . for a @xmath14quark distribution function in a proton @xmath90",
    "the parametrization cteq5 @xcite was used . in figures 3 and 4 at @xmath91",
    "tev and @xmath92 tev , accordingly , the curves show results of our calculations of @xmath69-spectra latexmath:[$(|y    the calculations from paper @xcite , adequate to the contribution of the gluon - gluon fusion production of @xmath1-baryons in a born approximation .",
    "thus , our calculations demonstrate , that the observed production cross section of @xmath1-baryons on colliders tevatron and lhc can be approximately 2 times more at the expense of the contribution of the parton subprocess @xmath94 , than it was predicted earlier in the papers @xcite .",
