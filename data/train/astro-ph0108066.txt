    "deep photometric surveys of star - forming regions and young open clusters have revealed a population of young substellar objects extending from the substellar borderline ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) to masses below the deuterium - burning limit ( 0.013@xmath5  or @xmath6 14@xmath7 , where 1@xmath5=1047@xmath7 ) .",
    "recent examples include searches in ic348 ( najita , tiede , & carr @xcite ) , the trapezium ( lucas et al@xmath3 @xcite ; hillenbrand & carpenter @xcite ; luhman et al@xmath3 @xcite ) , and the @xmath2orionis  cluster ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "these discoveries are leading to renewed theoretical work in the formation of substellar objects ( boss @xcite ; reipurth & clarke @xcite ) .",
    "the masses estimated for these objects assume membership in the cluster , and thus known age , distance and metallicity .",
    "this assumption needs to be tested with follow - up observations .",
    "the sequence of faint cluster members provides a homogeneous sample to study the relation between temperature and spectral properties .",
    "the atmospheres of substellar objects are complicated , being difficult to disentangle the effects of gravity , metallicity and temperature .",
    "dust grains are expected to condense and become an important source of opacity that affects the colors and spectra ( allard et al@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "the pleiades substellar sequence has been identified ( e.g. , bouvier et al@xmath3 @xcite ; stauffer et al@xmath3 @xcite ; zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 @xcite ) down to the lowest mass known pleiad , roque25 , with a mass determined at 0.035@xmath5  ( martn et al@xmath3 @xcite ) . the surveys in regions younger than the pleiades are sensitive to lower masses because substellar objects contract and cool quickly with time .",
    "hence , luminosity and mass functions can be extended to lower masses .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath2orionis  cluster ( bjar et al@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "it is a prime location to search for substellar objects because of its young age ( @xmath65myr ) , distance ( @xmath6350pc ) and low reddening . here",
    "we present near - infrared ( nir ) photometry and spectroscopy for a sample of isolated planetary - mass candidate members of the @xmath2orionis  cluster .",
    "the colors of the objects can be explained with models that include the presence of dust grains .",
    "the spectra provide strong evidence that these objects are indeed ultracool cluster members .",
    "zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) reported the discovery of 18 isolated planetary - mass candidate members in the @xmath2orionis  cluster . for two of them ,",
    "namely sori52 and 56 , they presented optical spectroscopy , and for an additional object they presented nir spectroscopy .",
    "we have found that the identification of this object was confused . the nir spectrum shown in fig .  3 of zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 corresponds to sori62 , not sori60 as stated in their table  1 .",
    "sori62 and 60 have indeed very similar magnitudes , spectral types and masses .",
    "hence , the conclusions of zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 remain unchanged .    on 2000 december 16 , we observed with the kecki nir camera nirc ( matthews & soifer @xcite ) .",
    "meteorological conditions were photometric and the seeing ranged from 0.3  to 0.7 , as measured in the nirc images .",
    "we obtained @xmath0-band images of eight planetary - mass candidate members of @xmath2orionis , and grism spectroscopy for four .",
    "the @xmath0-band images consisted of 12 coadds of 10  s each .",
    "the spectra were obtained with 3 coadds of 100  s each using the @xmath8 filter and the grism gr120 .",
    "this configuration provides simultaneous coverage of the @xmath9- and @xmath0-band spectra ( from 1.44 to 2.45@xmath1 m ) with very low dispersion ( 5.9nmpix@xmath10 ) .",
    "one object located 1.6  west and 3.7  north of sori47 , a spectroscopically confirmed cluster member ( zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 @xcite ) , was discovered in nir images obtained with the 2.2-m telescope in calar alto on 2000 february 1621 .",
    "we recovered it in a ccd image of sori47 collected with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al@xmath3 @xcite ) at keckii on 1998 december 21 , and we were able to measure a magnitude of @xmath11=24.2@xmath120.4 .",
    "thus , this is a very red object , with @xmath13=5.2@xmath120.5 .",
    "we call it sorij053814.4024012 .",
    "deep images ( total exposure time 360s in @xmath0-band ) and grism spectroscopy of sorij053814.4024012 were obtained with nirc .",
    "the data were reduced using standard routines for bias - substraction , flat - field correction and sky - substraction within the iraf enviroment .",
    "telluric absorption was removed using the nirc spectrum of the g0 star sao112561 , observed at similar airmass as the program objects .",
    "photometric calibration was made using the 2mass second incremental release point source catalog . in table  1",
    "we provide calibrated @xmath0-band photometry for all the targets .",
    "the @xmath11- and @xmath14-band photometry are taken from zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final smoothed nirc spectra are shown in fig .",
    "our new spectrum of sori47 is very similar to that presented by zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "sori60 and 66 present broad strong absorption features that we identify as water bands .",
    "identification of the co bands beyond 2.2@xmath1 m is rendered difficult by the low spectral resolution and modest s / n ratio of the data .",
    "sori69 also shows water bands , and possibly the methane bandhead at 2.2@xmath1 m .",
    "we do not see , however , any hint of methane in the @xmath9-band .",
    "since the spectrum of sori69 is rather noisy , we do not place high confidence on the detection of methane .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the @xmath0-band flux is depressed with respect to the @xmath9-band in comparison with brighter cluster members .",
    "allard et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) have shown that this is expected when dust grains condense below the photosphere .",
    "barrado y navascus et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) have obtained optical spectra of sori60 and 66 with the very large telescope .",
    "they measured h@xmath15 emission equivalent widths of 25  and 100  in sori60 and 66 , respectively .",
    "they estimated spectral types of l2.0@xmath120.5 for sori60 and l3.5@xmath122.0 for sori66 by comparison with field ultracool dwarfs .",
    "our data indicates that sori66 is slightly cooler than sori60 because the water bands are deeper . using the water index in the @xmath9-band defined by delfosse et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) and calibrated with the spectral types of martn et al@xmath3 ( @xcite )",
    ", we estimate spectral types of l5.5 for sori60 and l6 for sori66 .",
    "we tentatively classify sori69 as a t0 dwarf .",
    "a t0 dwarf shows clear methane absorption in the @xmath0-band ( bandhead at 2.2@xmath1 m , which may also be weakly present in the l5 dwarf denis - p020515 ; burgasser et al@xmath3 @xcite ) but not in the @xmath9-band ( bandhead at 1.6@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the strong methane band at 3.3@xmath1 m has been detected in mid - l dwarfs ( noll et al@xmath3 @xcite ) .    in order to compare our program objects with the trapezium objects observed by lucas et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) , we measured the water index w defined by those authors .",
    "we found w=0.66 for sori47 , and w=0.49 for sori60 and 66 .",
    "our values are within the range of values measured by lucas et al@xmath3 for the coolest trapezium objects , and suggest that the trapezium and @xmath2orionis  objects have similar temperatures .",
    "we do not find , however , the triangular shapes in @xmath9-band spectra reported by lucas et al@xmath3 for some of their objects .",
    "this could be due to the difference in age between the trapezium ( @xmath161myr ) and the @xmath2orionis  cluster ( @xmath65myr ) , which would imply that the members of the later cluster have higher gravities .",
    "the dissimilarities could also be due to some other effects .    the nirc spectrum of the possible very low - mass companion to sori47 is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we do not find strong methane or water bands in sorij053814.4024012 , suggesting that it is not a substellar object .",
    "we discuss this object further in the next section .",
    "all of our targets have very red colors , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , except for one of them , namely sori57 .",
    "this object is probably a field m dwarf .",
    "model atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs need to consider the effects of dust grains for producing such red colors .",
    "allard et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) have computed synthetic colors using two extreme approximations for the treatment of dust .",
    "dusty models assume that dust grains form in the upper atmosphere and remain there , producing a greenhouse effect . on the other hand ,",
    "cond models assume total gravitational condensation of dust grains below the photosphere , and effectively all dust opacity is neglected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show a color - magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones from the models of chabrier et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) for an age of 5myr ( for a detailed discussion of the cluster age and distance see bjar et al@xmath3 @xcite and zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 , in preparation ) . the objects plotted on the figure result from the combination of our photometry with that of bjar et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) and",
    "zapatero osorio et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "likely non - members of the cluster , such as sorij053814.4024012 and sori57 , have been excluded .",
    "three regimes can be distinguished in this figure : _",
    "( i ) _ dust free : for colors bluer than @xmath13=4.4 ( corresponding to surface temperatures @xmath19@xmath202500k , and masses @xmath21@xmath200.02@xmath5 ) atmosphere models without dust grains successfully reproduce the observed photometric sequence . _",
    "( ii ) _ dusty : the mean locus of objects deviates from the dust - free isochrone and intersects the dusty isochrone for @xmath13 colors between 4.4 and 5.0 ( @xmath19@xmath625001900k , @xmath21@xmath60.020.01@xmath5 ) .",
    "this temperature range corresponds to spectral types m9 through l3 ( basri et al@xmath3 @xcite ) , in agreement with our observations of sori45 ( m8.5 , bjar , zapatero osorio , & rebolo @xcite ) and sori62 ( l4 ) .",
    "sori47 is a benchmark object for this regime . _",
    "( iii ) _ settling dust : the dusty isochrone predicts that cooler objects should be redder but the observed locus of objects appears to turn blueward in @xmath13 color at the faintest end of the current study .",
    "the cond models have much bluer colors than the dusty models .",
    "thus , the colors of the faintest cluster members may be turning blue due to gravitational settling of dust grains .",
    "the transition from the red l dwarf colors to the blue t dwarf colors appears to be driven by the gravitational settling of dust grains .",
    "sori66 is a benchmark object for this regime .",
    "the possible presence of methane absorption in the @xmath0-band spectrum of sori69 suggests that it could be an early t dwarf with @xmath19@xmath61500k .",
    "the lack of obvious methane absorption in the @xmath9-band spectrum , and the red @xmath22 color of this object indicate that it is warmer than the t - dwarfs reported by leggett et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the small difference in magnitude and color between sori66 and 69 ( 0.54 mag in @xmath0 ) suggests that the gap between the latest l dwarf ( l6 ) and earliest t dwarf ( t0 ) has been bridged provided the fact that the presence of methane is confirmed in sori69 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we display a color - color diagram .",
    "note that sori66 and 69 are bluer than sori60 , even though they are fainter .",
    "those relatively blue colors are probably due to partial settling of dust grains below the photosphere .",
    "fainter cluster members are expected to have even bluer nir colors .",
    "this should be taken into account in future deep searches .",
    "our nirc images have a scale of 0.15/pix , and a total field of view of 38@xmath2338 .",
    "the fwhm of point sources in the nirc images of sori objects ranged from 2 to 4.5pix in the @xmath0-band .",
    "only one of the possible cluster members appeared more extended than the other sources in the same field .",
    "this object is sorij053814.4024012 , which had a fwhm of 5.4pix ( 0.81 )",
    ". its spectrum does not present water bands .",
    "this objects appears to be an extremely red galaxy ( erg ) .",
    "the nir spectrum of ergs is rather featureless ( cimatti et al@xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "we have searched for candidate companions to the @xmath2orionis  planetary - mass objects in the separation range 0.3  to 10 , corresponding to projected semimajor axis , @xmath24 , between 106au and 3520au at a distance of 352pc . besides sorij053814.4024012 , we find a resolved object at a separation of 6.3  north from sori66 with the following photometry : @xmath0@xmath619.5mag , @xmath22@xmath60.9mag and @xmath13@xmath62.8mag .",
    "no other companion candidates are seen in our nirc images . for the shorter separations , 0.3  to 0.6 , we are only sensitive to companions with nearly - equal mass as the primary , but for the longer separations our 3@xmath2 sensitivity limit is k@xmath619.5 , which translates into a mass of only 0.005@xmath5  in @xmath2orionis .",
    "we note that our sensitivity limit for the images of sori60 and 68 is brighter up to k@xmath618.9mag .",
    "martn et al@xmath3 ( @xcite ) have found a deficiency of binaries with semimajor axis @xmath2527au among pleiades very low - mass members . among field",
    "ultracool dwarfs , all known binaries with l - type primaries have projected separations smaller than 10au ( reid et al@xmath3 @xcite ) . clearly very low - mass binaries tend to be tight .",
    "is this a consequence of dynamical evolution ( wide binaries are loosely bound and can be disrupted ) or formation ( models of substellar object formation via ejection in a multiple system predict a dearth of wide substellar binaries , reipurth & clarke @xcite ) ?",
    "the lack of binaries with @xmath24@xmath25106au among the substellar members in @xmath2orionis  suggests that wide substellar binaries are also rare in a very young cluster , favouring the idea that formation conditions may be more important than dynamical evolution .",
    "our sample is , however , too small to draw strong conclusions about the binary statistics of the @xmath2orionis  substellar members .",
    "studies of future larger substellar samples in @xmath2orionis  and other young associations will be necessary to compare with the binary statistics of the pleiades and other clusters of similar age .",
