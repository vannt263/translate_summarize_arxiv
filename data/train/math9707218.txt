    "this means that there exists a sequence of simplices @xmath352 , where @xmath353 and a sequence of @xmath354 , such that          consider formula ( [ first ] ) .",
    "it means that the simplex @xmath359 can be expressed in terms of @xmath345 using @xmath347 .",
    "let us show that this implies that the simplex @xmath360 can be expressed in terms of @xmath361 using @xmath291 .",
    "indeed , according to the definition , the set @xmath362 contains all the simplices with vertices in some @xmath287 points @xmath363 .",
    "one of these simplices is @xmath359 . for simplicity of notations",
    "let us assume that @xmath364 where @xmath365 means that the point @xmath294 is not a vertex of the simplex .",
    "thus , @xmath366 consists of the following simplices :      to @xmath370 let us associate an element @xmath371 . for this consider @xmath286 points @xmath372 , where @xmath373 is the point of @xmath0 which is the closest to the point the point @xmath336 among all points of @xmath0 lying on the ray @xmath374 .",
    "then @xmath375 is the set of all simplices with the vertices in these @xmath286 points .",
    "thus , @xmath375 consists of the following simplices :          since each simplex @xmath385 , belongs to @xmath345 , each simplex @xmath386 belongs to @xmath361 according to the construction of @xmath361 .",
    "thus , @xmath387 where , as we have already mentioned , the simplex @xmath388 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath291 .",
    "we have proved that @xmath360 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath291 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath390 . let @xmath391 .",
    "this case can only occur if there is a vertex of @xmath256 which lies on some ray @xmath392 where @xmath393 , and which is not the closest point from @xmath0 to the point @xmath336 .",
    "for simplicity of notations let us denote here vertices of the simplices @xmath256 and @xmath349 as follows : @xmath395 @xmath396 we can also assume that in this notation the points @xmath397 and @xmath398 lie on the same ray @xmath399 .",
    "since the points @xmath412 lie on the same ray @xmath413 , all the simplices except @xmath256 and @xmath349 are not @xmath1-dimensional and do not belong to @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the simplex @xmath256 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath404 .",
    "if the simplices @xmath256 and @xmath349 differ by two points , then we consider first a simplex @xmath414 which differs from the simplex @xmath349 only by one point and express it in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath291 .",
    "then by applying the above arguments to the simplices @xmath414 and @xmath256 we can express the simplex @xmath415 in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath291 . by repeating this process we prove that the simplex @xmath256 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 using @xmath291 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath29 constructed by the algorithm is a geometrical basis in @xmath24 ."
