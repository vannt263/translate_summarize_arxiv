    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are attracting an increasing interest as quantum simulator for condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "optical lattices are realized by means of one or more continuous sinusoidal potentials created by exploiting the electric dipole interactions between the atoms and the laser beams @xcite .",
    "depending on the beam geometry one can realize one- , two- , or three - dimensional periodic lattices , with one or more wells per unit cell @xcite ; quasiperiodic structures are also possible ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the tight binding regime , when the lattice intensity is sufficiently high so that the atoms are deeply localized in the lowest vibrational states of the potential wells ( each well being associated to a site of a discrete lattice ) , it is convenient to map the system hamiltonian onto a discrete lattice model ( or _ tight binding model _ ) , representing the usual tool for theoretical calculations .",
    "the paradigms are the hubbard model for fermions @xcite , and the bose - hubbard model for bosons @xcite .",
    "these models are characterized by tunnelling coefficients related to the hopping between neighbouring sites , and interaction strengths which characterize the onsite interaction among the atoms , whose actual values depend on the parameters of the underlying continuous model .",
    "as the mapping between the continuous and discrete versions of the system hamiltonian is achieved by means of an expansion over a basis of localized functions at each potential well @xcite , a precise knowledge of these basis functions is therefore important to connect the actual experimental parameters with the coefficients of the discrete model employed in the theoretical calculations .    for a simple sinusoidal potential ,",
    "the natural basis is provided by the exponentially decaying wannier functions discussed by kohn @xcite .",
    "notably , in this case the expression for the tunnelling coefficient turns out to depend just on the bloch spectrum @xcite , being therefore independent on the basis choice ( this does not hold for the interaction coupling ) .",
    "analytic expressions for both coefficients can be obtained by means of different approximations @xcite .    in the case of two wells per unit cell ,",
    "the kohn - wannier recipe is not sufficient .",
    "for example , for a symmetric double - well the kohn - wannier functions display the same symmetry as the local potential structure @xcite and thus they occupy both wells and can not be associated to a single lattice site . a common approach used in the literature",
    "is that of the so - called atomic orbitals @xcite , that has been recently employed e.g. for the case of a symmetric double - well unit cell of two - dimensional graphene - like optical lattices @xcite .",
    "this method is based on a specific ansatz , according to which tight - binding wannier functions are constructed from linear combinations of wave functions deeply localized in the two potential wells of the unit cell .",
    "a more general approach is the one proposed by marzari and vanderbilt @xcite , where maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) are obtained by minimizing the spread of a set of wannier functions by means of a suitable gauge transformation of the bloch eigenfunctions .",
    "this method coincides with the kohn method for the single band mlwfs of a one - dimensional potential , but it can be extended to more complex situations when _ generalized _ mlwfs for composite bands are needed .",
    "the method is implemented by means of a software package , and is largely employed for computing mlwfs of real condensed matter systems @xcite .    in this article , we consider the case of a one - dimensional periodic potential with a double - well per unit cell @xcite , discussing an alternative method for constructing the low - lying generalized mlwfs based on the minimal spread requirement of marzari _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , specifically suited for double - well potentials . in particular , we consider a composite band formed by the two lowest bloch bands and , differently from @xcite , we design a two - step gauge transformation specific for a composite two band system , that can be solved by integrating a set of ordinary differential equations , with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "this allows to efficiently compute the tunnelling coefficients and the other tight binding coefficients in terms of the parameter of the continuous potential .",
    "we also remark that , though the approach of marzari _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was proposed for degenerate bands , we find that the method works properly in a wider regime , provided that the first band gap does not exceed the distance between the second and third band .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : tb ]",
    "we review the mapping of a many - body hamiltonian onto a tight binding model , discussing in particular the case of a sinusoidal periodic potential with a double well in the unit cell .",
    "then , in section [ sec : mlwfs ] we describe the gauge transformation for constructing the _ generalized _ mlwfs , giving some examples and comparing them with those of the single band approach .",
    "then , in section [ sec : regimes ] , we discuss the regime of validity of the _ composite band _ approach , and compare the predictions of the _ full _ and _ nearest - neighbour _ versions of the model by discussing the behaviour of the tunnelling coefficients and the other tight - binding parameters .",
    "final considerations are drawn in the conclusions .",
    "technical points regarding the mapping on momentum space and the numerical implementation are discussed in the appendices .",
    "let us start by reviewing how tight - binding models are defined from a continuous potential . as a specific example , here we consider a one - dimensional many - body hamiltonian for ultracold bosons @xcite @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the bosonic field operator , @xmath2 the single particle hamiltonian , and @xmath3 a double - well periodic potential of the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 strictly non vanishing ( @xmath7 ) in order to fix the overall period to @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "this is a typical potential used in the experiments with ultracold atoms @xcite , by which one can construct an _ optical lattice _ with one or two wells in the unit cell .",
    "in particular , the condition for having two minima in each period for any value of @xmath10 is @xmath11 . in the following , the potential amplitudes @xmath12",
    "will be expressed in units of @xmath13 , the so - called _ recoil energy _ for an atom absorbing a photon of the first lattice .    )",
    "( here @xmath14 ) : ( a ) two different minima , with the overall potential having two centers of parity , for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ; ( b ) an asymmetric double - well with parity that is broken globally - in this example @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) ; ( c ) a symmetric double - well , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the black dots in ( a ) , ( c ) represent the parity centers of the whole periodic potential . ]    the phases @xmath10 and @xmath21 are arbitrary ; @xmath21 represents a rigid shift of the whole potential , while @xmath10 can be varied along with the ratio of the amplitudes @xmath22 to change the landscape of the potential . for convenience",
    ", the unit cell is defined as having two maxima at the cell borders , with both minima inside the cell ( see figure [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "in addition , the angle @xmath21 is tuned in order to have a unit cell centered in @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] , with the absolute minimum in the left well .",
    "is also useful for testing the robustness of the numerical method for obtaining the mlwfs , that indeed should not depend on an overall translation of the potential . ]",
    "depending on the value of @xmath10 , it is possible to realize three different configurations , as shown in figure [ fig : pot ] .",
    "( a ) a unit cell with two different minima and with degenerate maxima , for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) ; in this case the whole periodic potential has two ( classes of ) parity centers , corresponding to the two minima , with all the maxima being degenerate .",
    "( b ) an asymmetric double - well with parity that is globally broken , for any @xmath27 .",
    "( c ) a symmetric double - well in the unit cell , for @xmath28 ; in this case the potential has again two centers of parity , now at the two maxima , with all the minima being degenerate .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , when the potential wells are deep enough , it may be convenient to map the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mbham ] ) onto a _ tight binding model _ on the discrete lattice corresponding to the potential minima , by expanding the field operator @xmath29 on a basis @xmath30 of functions localized around each minimum @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) represent the creation ( destruction ) operator of a single particle at site @xmath34 , and satisfy the usual commutation rules @xmath35=\\delta_{jj'}\\delta_{nn'}$ ] ( following from those for the field @xmath36 ) .    in the presence of a single well per unit cell",
    ", it is known that a basis of localized functions is provided by the exponentially decaying wannier functions @xmath37 discussed by kohn @xcite . in general , this is not the case when there are two wells per unit cell .",
    "for example , for a symmetric double - well the kohn - wannier functions display the same symmetry of the local potential structure @xcite and thus they can not be associated to a single lattice site as as they occupy both wells in the unit cell . in the next section",
    "we will show that when the two lowest bloch bands are sufficiently close to each other with respect to the third band ( as it will be clear from the discussion in sect . [ sec : examples ] and [ sec : regimes ] ) , we can construct a set of _ generalized _ wannier functions @xmath38 that are maximally localized at each minima , by following the approach of marzari and vanderbilt @xcite for a _",
    "composite band_. this corresponds to the generalization of the _ single band approximation _",
    "( in case of a single well lattice ) to the double well case , as we need at least two localized functions in each lattice cell to map the system on the discrete lattice",
    ". then , in section [ sec : regimes ] , we will explore the range of validity of this composite band approaches , highlighting the different implications on the structure of different tight binding models .        in the following",
    "we will restrict the analysis to the two lowest energy bands , in analogy with the single band approximation for the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "then , within this approximation , the single particle hamiltonian can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath34 is the unit cell index whereas @xmath40 substitutes the band index @xmath41 being an internal index labelling the left and right sub - wells respectively ( see figure [ fig : doublewell ] ) . here",
    "the expansion coefficients correspond to the onsite energies @xmath42 , and to the tunnelling amplitudes between different ( sub)wells @xmath43 .",
    "in general , it is customary to further approximate the above expression by neglecting the coupling beyond nearest neighbours both for the single - well @xcite and double - well lattices @xcite .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for a single well lattice in the tight binding regime @xcite , but may not be fully justified in the range of the typical experimental parameters for a double well , as we will discuss later on .",
    "for this reason , here we keep all the terms corresponding to nearest - neighbouring cells , characterized by the following tunnelling coefficients @xmath44 as shown in figure [ fig : doublewell ] .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath45    when the tunnelling @xmath46 and @xmath47 are negligible the above expression can be further simplified by retaining just the coupling between nearest neighbouring wells @xmath48 this is the analogous of the nearest - neighbours approximation for the single - well case and it is commonly used in the literature @xcite .",
    "hereinafter , we will refer to the approximate hamiltonians in ( [ eq : fullh ] ) and ( [ eq : h0-cb ] ) as the ( single particle ) _ full _ and _ nearest - neighbour _ tight - binding models , respectively .    finally , the general form of the interaction term is @xmath49 here we consider just the onsite contributions in the two sub - wells a and b @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to the usual approximation used for the single well case ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and is justified when the basis functions @xmath30 are strongly localized in each sub - well . in general , once these functions are known , the next - to - leading interaction terms can be straightforwardly computed by evaluating the corresponding superposition integral of four @xmath52 s .",
    "let us now consider the single particle spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : fullh ] ) .",
    "by defining @xmath53 the _ full _ tight binding hamiltonian ( [ eq : fullh ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 where the operators @xmath57 satisfy the canonical commutation relations , @xmath58=\\delta({k}-{k'})\\delta_{\\nu\\nu'}$ ] .",
    "then , by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath59 , and defining @xmath60 , we get ( see also @xcite ) @xmath61 that represents the spectrum of the _ full _ tight binding model in ( [ eq : fullh ] ) . in addition , with @xmath62 , the same expression gives also the spectrum for the _ nearest - neighbour _ approximation in ( [ eq : h0-cb ] ) .",
    "instead , in the _ single band _",
    "case we simply have @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 @xmath65 being the exact bloch spectrum ; notably these expressions do not depend on the choice of the wannier basis .",
    "in this section we discuss the method for constructing the mlwfs for the double well case . in order to fix the notations ,",
    "let us first recall some basic properties of periodic systems @xcite .",
    "owing to the bloch s theorem , the eigenfunctions of the single particle hamiltonian @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 , the @xmath68 s having the same periodicity of the potential and satisfying the following normalization in the unit cell , @xmath69 .",
    "the wannier functions for a single band are defined as @xmath70 with @xmath71 indicating the first brillouin zone , @xmath72 $ ] , and @xmath73 , whereas generalized wannier functions for composite bands have the same formal expression but are built up from a linear combination of bloch eigenstates , namely @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the wannier functions satisfy the ortho - normality relation @xmath77 .",
    "we also remark that the generalized bloch functions @xmath78 are not eigenstates of @xmath66 ; however , their ortho - normality relations are preserved , owing to the unitarity of the transformation matrices @xmath79 .",
    "different choices of the matrices @xmath79 lead to different results and it is customary to speak about _ gauge dependence _ of the wannier functions due to the @xmath80-dependence of the @xmath81 transformations . in the single band case",
    "the arbitrariness reduces to the abelian @xmath82 group of phase transformations coming from the freedom in choosing the bloch basis at each @xmath80 .",
    "a general approach to obtain mlwfs has been proposed in a seminal paper by marzari and vanderbilt @xcite , where mlwfs are obtained by minimizing the generalized wannier spread @xmath83 $ ] by means of a suitable gauge transformation of the bloch eigenfunctions . in the case of a single band",
    "the method returns the kohn result @xcite .",
    "marzari and vanderbilt have shown that the spread can be written as the sum of two positive terms , @xmath84 , the first being gauge invariant and therefore fixing the minimal spread .",
    "the gauge dependent term @xmath85 can be further split into the diagonal and off - diagonal components , @xmath86 , that in the one - dimensional case read @xmath87    both @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be written in terms of the generalized berry vector potentials @xmath90 , defined as @xcite @xmath91 with the matrix @xmath92 being hermitian , @xmath93 ( it follows from @xmath94 ) .",
    "we also recall that the integral over the first brillouin zone of @xmath95 gives the one band zak - berry phases @xmath96 @xmath97 which are proportional to the offset of the wannier function centers , @xmath98 @xcite , yielding @xmath99 ( this relation is preserved under a generic unitary gauge transformation , as in ( [ eq : mlwfs ] ) ) .",
    "it is also worth to remember that the single wannier centers are invariant only under single band @xmath82 gauge transformations , whereas for general @xmath81 transformations only their sum is conserved @xcite .",
    "then , the expressions for @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be written as @xmath100 and in general can be reduced by means of a functional minimization in @xmath80 space , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we use a different approach , specifically suited for constructing the set of mlwfs for the double - well case .",
    "namely , we show that the minimization problem can be reformulated by identifying a specific gauge transformation for a composite band in one dimension , expressed in terms of a set of ordinary differential equations with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we recall that in one dimension @xmath101 can be made strictly vanishing , and this corresponds to find a gauge ( also called _ parallel transport _ gauge ) in which the matrix @xmath90 is diagonal , with the diagonal elements being constant and equal to their mean values .",
    "the latter are related to the eigenvalues of the matrix generalizing the berry phase to the non abelian case @xcite .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal spreads @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be minimized either simultaneously or independently . for the following discussion ,",
    "it is useful to distinguish between two kind of gauge transformations .",
    "i. diagonal @xmath81 transformations which correspond to a set of _ single band _ gauge transformations of the form @xmath102 being a real continuous ( differentiable ) function of @xmath80 , such that @xmath103 ( @xmath104 integer ) in order to have periodic and single valued bloch eigenstates .",
    "then , we can set @xmath105 without loss of generality .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this transformation may be used to minimize each term of @xmath88 , as it affects the wannier spread @xmath106 while preserving their centers @xmath107 ( modulo a lattice vector ) . in particular ,",
    "@xmath88 can be set exactly to zero @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath108 , and therefore @xmath109 that vanishes by imposing @xmath110 this equation can be readily solved numerically , as discussed in [ sec : numerics ] and [ sec : gaugetransf ] .",
    "in addition , it is straightforward to verify that under the transformation ( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) , @xmath111 changes only by a phase factor , and therefore @xmath89 remains unchanged .",
    "a _ full gauge transformation in the composite band _ of the form @xmath112 where , as already said , @xmath113 ( for a @xmath114-composite band ) , constrained to the following periodic condition @xmath115    under such a transformation the generalized berry potentials transform as @xmath116    in general , @xmath117 can be written as a semidirect product @xmath118 , with @xmath82 being subgroup of @xmath117 consisting of matrices of the form diag@xmath119 .",
    "as anticipated , here we restrict to a @xmath120 case , and therefore we have @xmath121 with @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , by using the following parametrization for a matrix @xmath124 , @xmath125 with @xmath126 and @xmath127 being the pauli matrices , we can write @xmath128 with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    then , since @xmath133 transforms as follows @xmath134 @xmath135 in order to get @xmath136 one has to impose ( see ( [ eq : atilde ] ) ) @xmath137 notice that the former , ( [ eq : ann ] ) , is an integro - differential equation where the right - end side corresponds to the center of the wannier functions , @xmath138 , that are not known _ a priori _ ( only their sum is conserved in the _ parallel transport _ gauge ) .",
    "therefore , in the following we will consider a specific transformation that makes @xmath89 vanish without specific requirements on the transformation of @xmath88 , given by the solution of ( [ mastereq ] ) .",
    "then , by using ( [ eq : umatrix ] ) , the latter can be transformed in a system of four differential equations for @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , whose normal form is @xmath143 @xmath144 where we have defined @xmath145 , with @xmath146 .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : chi - phi ] ) is @xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "then , it is evident that only two equations are left , namely ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and ( [ eq : theta ] ) , with @xmath149 playing the role of a parameter , and with one of the angles among @xmath150 and @xmath151 being arbitrary .",
    "we then can choose @xmath152 without loss of generality .",
    "in addition , in order to conform to ( [ eq : u - periodicity ] ) , the angles @xmath139 and @xmath140 must satisfy the following periodicity conditions @xmath153 with @xmath154 integers which can be taken @xmath155 without loss of generality .",
    "this set of equations , ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : theta ] ) , ( [ eq : alpha - period ] ) , and ( [ eq : theta - period ] ) can be solved as discussed in [ sec : gaugetransf ] .",
    "the resulting transformation is an @xmath156 matrix @xmath157 of the form ( [ eq : umatrix ] ) with @xmath158 and @xmath141 constant .    summarizing",
    ", the procedure to make @xmath159 vanish can be divided in two steps : _ ( a ) _ a gauge transformation of type ii to make @xmath89 vanish ( without specific requirements on the transformation of the diagonal elements @xmath95 ) ; _ ( b ) _",
    "a set of two gauge transformation of type i ( one for each band ) that makes @xmath88 vanish without affecting @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the full transformation can be decomposed in the following way @xmath160 it is straightforward to verify that ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) can be cast again in the form ( [ eq : u0matrix ] ) by properly redefining the parameters @xmath161 .      here",
    "we present some example of _ generalized _ mlwfs obtained with the transformation discussed above , and we compare them with the _ single band _",
    "the latter can be obtained by using just the gauge transformation of type i , and correspond to the exponentially decaying wannier functions discussed by kohn @xcite .",
    "both gauge transformations are solved by using the representation of bloch functions in @xmath80-space , by means of the numerical methods discussed in [ sec : numerics ] and [ sec : gaugetransf ] .    , @xmath162 , @xmath19 .",
    "]     for @xmath15 . ]     for @xmath15 , @xmath163 . ]    in figure [ fig : wannier ] we show the case of a symmetric double well , @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the _ single band _",
    "mlwfs have the same symmetry of the potential @xcite , therefore occupying both wells in the unit cell . instead , each of the _ generalized _ mlwfs nicely localizes in one of the sub - wells , as wanted .",
    ", that is manifestly in contradiction with the definition of the tunneling coefficients given in figure [ fig : doublewell ] .",
    "nevertheless , such wave functions may be useful for discussing the boundary conditions for ( [ eq : alpha])-([eq : chi - phi ] ) , see [ sec : gaugetransf ] . ]",
    "then , in figures [ fig : wannier0 - 10 ] , [ fig : wannier0 - 1 ] we show two cases of an asymmetric double well , here for @xmath15 .",
    "these figures are useful for illustrating the role of the band gaps .",
    "the case in figure [ fig : wannier0 - 10 ] corresponds to a band gap between the first two bands that is larger than the one between the second and third band ; in this case both the _ single band _",
    "mlwfs are already localized within a single well , the one in panels ( b , d ) having a small residual amplitude around the neighbouring wells .",
    "the _ generalized _ mlwfs do not differ much from the former in linear scale , the effect of the gauge mixing transformation being a reduction of the lateral lobes of the _ single band _",
    "mlwf in ( b , d ) , but the price to pay is a substantial increase of the width of the other one in log scale , see panel ( a ) .",
    "actually , in this case composite band approach is not fully justified , due to the large band gap between the first and second band , and one should consider the structure of the upper bands .",
    "this however goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead , figure [ fig : wannier0 - 1 ] shows a case still for @xmath15 but where an almost degeneracy between the two minima ( that corresponds to a quasi degeneracy of the lowest two bands ) is restored thanks to a lower value of @xmath6 ( here @xmath164 instead of @xmath165 as in the former figure ) . here the advantage of using the _ generalized _ mlwfs is clearly visible .",

    "we recall that the potential is characterized by three parameters , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath10 .",

    ", we chose @xmath173 in order to fulfil the tight binding regime , in a feasible range for current experiments with ultra cold atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , for having both wells deep enough in order to have the corresponding mlwfs mostly localized within each well , @xmath6 should not exceed @xmath174 .    as we have anticipated in the previous section , in principle the _ composite band _",

    ", we find that the composite band approach provides a basis of functions well localized in each of the two sub - wells and correctly reproduces the lowest two bloch energy bands even up to @xmath178 , in the parameter range discussed above .    in order to characterize the level of fidelity in reproducing the exact single particle bloch spectrum ( that can be readily computed as discussed in [ sec : numerics ] ) , we define the following quantity @xmath179^{2}}\\ ] ] that represents the ratio of the quadratic spread between the exact bloch spectrum @xmath65 and that of the tight binding hamiltonians ( [ eq : fullh ] ) and ( [ eq : h0-cb ] ) , to the bandwidth @xmath180 .",

    "_ gauge mixing transformation : method 2 .",
    "_ in order to solve ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : theta ] ) , we have also employed another method that originates from the observation that in the case of two degenerate symmetric minima in the elementary cell ( @xmath204 ) , simple symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of bloch eigenstates give rise to two wannier functions located each at one of the two degenerate minima ( though they are not the maximally localized ones ) . in this situation , we have verified that initial conditions for the matrix @xmath250 - corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of bloch eigenstates - allow to obtain the periodic solutions minimizing @xmath89 which coincide both integrating from @xmath251 to @xmath252 and vice - versa . by smoothly changing @xmath10 , we start from the same initial conditions and then we iterate the integration of ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : theta ] ) by taking as initial angles , at each step , the mean values of the final values of the preceding integration ( at the two boundaries of the bz ) .",

    "notably , this choice yields real tunnelling coefficients ( in principle this is not guaranteed , see [ sec : ambiguities ] ) .",
    "let us start by considering the following exact expression for the bloch spectrum @xmath258 with the coefficients @xmath259 being the expectation values of @xmath66 on single band wannier functions @xcite @xmath260 this expression is manifestly gauge invariant .",
    "instead , the analogous expression in terms of the generalized mlwfs depends on the gauge .",
    "in fact , with some manipulations we can write ( here we are implicitly considering just the first two bands , @xmath41 ) @xmath261 with @xmath262 and @xmath263 by truncating ( [ eq : compositebloch ] ) to nearest neighbouring cells ( @xmath264 ) and using the definitions of the onsite energies and of the tunnelling coefficients in ( [ eq : jnu])-([eq : jab ] ) , we have @xmath265 \\label{energymlwf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath266 and @xmath124 ( see sect .

    "though each energy @xmath65 in ( [ energymlwf ] ) depends on the gauge ( through the the matrix @xmath79 ) , it is not difficult to demonstrate that their sum , @xmath267 , is gauge invariant like the analogous expression obtained form ( [ eq : singlebloch ] ) .",
    "in addition , once we have chosen the _ parallel transport gauge _ , corresponding to the generalized mlwfs with minimal spread ( @xmath268 ) , the expression ( [ energymlwf ] ) is univocally defined despite the presence of residual phase arbitrariness ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "let us now show that the relevant quantities are univocally defined in the _ parallel transport gauge _",
    ", despite possible ambiguities in the procedure for obtaining the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "first of all , we remind that the whole procedure starts from a particular gauge , as discussed in [ sec : numerics ] . choosing a different initial gauge amounts to perform a diagonal transformation on bloch eigenstates @xmath269 being @xmath270 an arbitrary periodic real function ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : mlwfs ] ) .",
    "consequently , the full gauge transformation matrix leading to the _ parallel transport gauge _ changes as @xmath271 then , it is easy to see that the onsite energies and tunnelling coefficients in ( [ eq : jnu])-([eq : jab ] ) are invariant under this transformation , as well as the energies in ( [ energymlwf ] ) , whereas the real and imaginary parts of the mlwfs change , conserving their modulus .",
    "the procedure to make @xmath101 vanishing does not imply any other @xmath80-dependent ambiguity on the matrix @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , in the _ parallel transport _ gauge we still have the freedom to perform two independent @xmath82 gauge transformations for each band with angles @xmath272 which necessarily obey @xmath273 .",
    "these terms appear as multiplicative factors on the rows of the matrix @xmath274 .",
    "finally , it turns out that - given a set of parameters @xmath275 and @xmath255 - there is not a unique set of boundary conditions for the angles @xmath276 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 satisfying ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , ( [ eq : theta ] ) ( and thus not an unique transformation @xmath277 leading to @xmath278 ) . for @xmath204",
    "these boundary values can be fixed as discussed in [ sec : gaugetransf ] .",
    "different choices may also be possible .",
    "however , it is not difficult to prove that none of these ambiguities affect either the energies in ( [ energymlwf ] ) , or the modulus of the mlwfs and of the tunnelling coefficients . instead ,",
