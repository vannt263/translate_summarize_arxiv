    "groups of galaxies are important laboratories to study galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "they are in the stage between the field and the densest environment in the universe , massive clusters ( @xcite ) and as many as @xmath3 of all galaxies reside in galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "it is valuable to study galaxy groups over a range of cosmic time to understand the effect of the group environment on the galaxy population .",
    "several efforts have been made to identify groups and clusters up to redshift one and beyond ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the faint x - ray emission and low galaxy number densities of galaxy groups make such environments difficult to distinguish from the field compared to massive galaxy clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "we have a relatively good knowledge and samples of galaxy groups in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) but there is a lack of similar samples of galaxy groups which have both sufficiently deep x - ray data and counterparts with optical spectroscopy at high redshift . in the presence of advances in deep x - ray surveys , extended x - ray emission provides a reliable signal to detect such environments at high redshifts .",
    "there are a number of different methods for detecting groups of galaxies : searches in optical data via the red - sequence method ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect on the cosmic microwave background , cmb ( e.g. @xcite ; x - ray emission from hot intracluster gas ( e.g. @xcite ) ; cosmic shear due to weak gravitational lensing maps ( e.g. @xcite ) ; and spectroscopic group samples ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while spectroscopic surveys reveal the largest and deepest group catalogs , detection of the group x - ray emission has been proven to ensure objects are virialized , and with the deepest x - ray survey available to date , the limits to which x - ray emission can be detected are reaching the level of low - mass groups .",
    "moreover , compared to shear maps , x - rays probe a wider range in mass and redshift ( @xcite ) .    in this paper , with recent deep chandra data ( nandra et al . in prep ) , we search for galaxy groups in a wide range of redshift in the extended groth strip ( egs ) . in previous work ,",
    "searching for galaxy groups in chandra data with a nominal exposure time of 200 ks and @xmath4 coverage of egs field yielded a discovery of seven high significance galaxy groups in this field ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now add new chandra data with approximately 800 ks exposure time covering @xmath5 field ; see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "furthermore , egs is one of the four fields in deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 ( deep2 ) spectroscopy survey ( @xcite ) and it is the only field which has been targeted for extensive spectroscopic data in deep3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deep2 and deep3 coverage of egs are magnitude limited but not color selected , yielding a large sample of spectroscopic galaxies at all redshifts enabling us to identify our groups optically and determine their velocity dispersions .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows : section 2 presents a brief description of aegis survey and our data , section 3 describes our method for group identification .",
    "we present our identified group catalog in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present spectroscopic group membership and dynamical properties of th groups .",
    "we make a comparison between the x - ray groups and optical groups which are identified from voronoi - delaunay method ( vdm ) in the deep2 spectroscopic dataset in section 6.@xmath6throughout this paper a @xmath7 cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 where h=0.71 is assumed .",
    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) brings together deep imaging data from x - ray to radio wavelengths and optical spectroscopy over a large area ( 0.5 - 1 @xmath12 ) .",
    "this survey includes : chandra / acis x - ray ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) , galex ultraviolet ( 1200 - 2500 @xmath13 ) , cfht / megacam legacy survey optical ( 3600 - 9000 @xmath13 ) , cfht / cfh12k optical ( 4500 - 9000 @xmath13 ) , hubble space telescope / acs optical ( 4400 - 8500 @xmath13 ) , palomar / wirc near - infrared ( 1.2 - 2.2 @xmath14 ) , spitzer / irac mid - infrared ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8 @xmath14 , vla radio continuum ( 6 - 20 cm ) and a large spectroscopic dataset using the deimos spectrograph on the keck ii 10 m telescope in an area with low extinction and low galactic and zodiacal infrared emission ( davis et al . 2007 ) . in the following section we will describe the various data sets used in this analysis .",
    "our very deep chandra survey used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) in three contiguous fields covering a total area of 0.25 @xmath12 ( nandra et al . in prep ) and a series of eight pointings covering a total area of approximately @xmath15 in the extended groth strip .",
    "@xcite provided the details for the latter survey and the x - ray point sources catalog .",
    "the total exposure time is approximately 3.4 ms with nominal exposure of 800 ks in each three central fields .",
    "we also used the xmm - newton observations of the field ( objids 0127921001 , 0127921101 , 0127921201 , 0503960101 ) , which were processed and co - added following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the total time of xmm observations is 100ks and its contribution to the final coverage can be seen in figure [ fig1 ] as a roundish area in the southern part of the survey . here",
    "we present the x - ray extended sources catalog based on the chandra and xmm observations in egs .    in the chandra analysis",
    ", we have applied a conservative event screening and modeling of the quiescent background .",
    "we have filtered the light - curve events using the lc clean tool in order to remove normally undetected particle flares .",
    "the background model maps have been evaluated with the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we estimated the particle background by using the acis stowed position observations and rescaling them by the ratio of the hard band ( 9.5@xmath1612kev ) fluxes .",
    "the cosmic background flux has been evaluated by subtracting the particle background maps from the real data and masking the area occupied by the detected sources .",
    "we applied the method which has been used in @xcite to search for extended sources and as a result we found 56 extended sources in egs strip .",
    "briefly , x - ray data have been obtained from x - ray mosaics made from coaddition of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 data .",
    "after background subtraction and point source removal for each observation and each instrument separately , the residual images were co - added , taking into account the difference in the sensitivity of each instrument to produce a joint exposure map . to detect the sources we run a wavelet detection at @xmath19 and @xmath20 spatial scales , similar to the procedure described in @xcite .",

    "this covers 0.4 deg@xmath26 of the d3 field and provides deep imaging to @xmath31 ( ab ) in the three nir bands .",
    "photometric redshifts in the region covered by the nir data were determined using the ` le phare ` code as described in @xcite .",
    "the deep2 redshift survey has targeted @xmath32 @xmath12 within four fields on the sky using the deimos multi - object spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the deep2 targets have @xmath33 .",
    "the egs is one of these four fields .",
    "compared to other deep2 fields , the egs spectroscopy is magnitude limited , but not color - selected , giving the advantage of a sample of galaxies at all redshifts ( @xcite ) . in addition , this region of sky has been targeted for extensive spectroscopy with deep3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deep2 and deep3 catalogs have about 23,822 unique objects in total(with -2@xmath34redshift quality@xmath344 ) and 16,857 objects with reliable redshifts ( with redshift quality@xmath353 ) .",
    "in addition to deep2 and deep3 , egs is located in sloan digital sky survey coverage so we have additional spectra for our low redshift galaxies .",
    "we also used redshifts of spectroscopic galaxies obtained in follow - up observations of the deep2 sample with the hectospec spectrograph on the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ; @xcite ) .",
    "to identify the groups in redshift space , we used galaxies with good redshift quality in deep2 and deep3 to construct our initial redshift catalog . using this catalog ,",
    "imaging data , and position of x - ray extended sources , we assigned a redshift to each x - ray source visually where the spatial distribution of galaxies in the sky coincide with the x - ray emission .",
    "for those sources for which we found more than one counterpart and the x - ray shape allows to securely seprate the contribution from several counterparts , we define a new i d in our x - ray catalog .",
    "the detected sources areas searched for flux extension down to 90% confidence level which is subsequently used for flux estimation .",
    "we also used the refined red - sequence technique , described in @xcite , to confirm the overdensity of red galaxies within or near those x - ray sources which have a lack of spectroscopic data . in brief , we selected galaxies with @xmath36 and within a physical distance of 0.5@xmath37mpc from the center of x - ray emission at the given redshift .",
    "then , using a gaussian weight , we count galaxies around the model red - sequence and find overdensities . since different observed colors are sensitive to red galaxies at different redshifts , we adopt the following combination of colors and magnitudes .",

    "we have spectroscopic redshifts for 49 galaxy groups and more than two spectroscopic members for 46 galaxy groups .",
    "we also assigned a flag for each extended source that describes the quality of the identification .",
    "flag=1 indicates confident redshift assignment and significant x - ray emission and also good centering , while for flag=2 the centering has a large uncertainty . in the cases",
    "when a single x - ray source has been matched to several optical counterparts the assigned flag is equal to 2 or larger . for flag=3",
    "we have no spectroscopic confirmation but good centering and for flag=4 we have unlikely redshifts due to the lack of spectroscopic objects and red galaxies and also a large uncertainty in centering .",
    "we assigned flag=5 for the 13 unreliable cases for which we could not identify any redshift .",

    "some of the x - ray extended sources do not have spherical and symmetric morphologies and some exhibit a secondary peak in x - ray distribution .",
    "initially , we expect this results from overlapping systems but visual inspection of optical data and the red - sequence method indicate a single significant group for some of these .",
    "so , we classify the second shallow peak in x - rays as substructure inside those real groups .",
    "furthermore , sources on the edge of x - ray coverage with low signal to noise and no optical counterparts could be explained as residual background level in the images or bright x - ray clusters outside the field of view .",

    "since we did not have a deep z - band image for this group , there was a strong limit on our color - magnitude diagram and thus the red - sequence signal and therefore we called it a group candidate .",

    "the factor 1.135 corrects for the 2@xmath45 clipping of the gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "we then consider the r - band luminosity - weighted centroid in projected space as the center of the group and the mean redshift of the galaxy members as the group redshifts and again find the galaxy members .",
    "we repeat the entire process until we obtain a stable membership solution .",

    "the catalog is reaching fluxes of @xmath113 ergs s@xmath11 cm@xmath108 with 52 systems detected by chandra .",
    "previously chandra catalogs at such depths contain half a dozen objects per field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deep2 and deep3 redshift surveys which provide the most complete sample at intermediate redshift and the largest accurate data sets at @xmath115 , combined with deep x - ray imaging from chandra in egs field , bring a deep study of galaxy groups to a new level .",
    "spectroscopic member galaxies are selected by applying different cuts : two x - ray based and optically based virial radius and two cuts along the line of sight .",
    "we examined the @xmath56 relation for each cut and discussed the effects of them on the relation .",
    "we explored substructure in the groups by applying the dressler - shectman test and discussed its effect on the overestimation of velocity dispersion .",
    "we also looked at the compactness of the x - ray emission of the groups and its effect on the scaling relation .",
    "a comparison between dynamical mass and x - ray mass of the groups is also done .",
    "finally , x - ray galaxy groups are compared with optical galaxy groups which are identified from vdm groups .",
    "our results show : + 1 ) our detection of a high - z group illustrates that megasecond chandra exposures are required for detecting such objects in the volume of deep fields .",
    "smaller exposures , as @xcite , only yields a marginal detection .",
    "2 ) for a sample of groups with a wide range of x - ray luminosities , choise of a constant @xmath89 for member selection can cause a large scatter in @xmath56 relation .",
    "3 ) choice of x - ray based virial radius or optically based virial radius does not have significant effect on the scatter around @xmath56 relation for groups with high x - ray luminosities .",
    "4 ) substructure in groups can inflate velocity dispersion as outliers are also included in galaxies with dynamical complexity .",
    "5 ) we find a compact group at z=0.24 with a concentrated x - ray emission with high velocity dispersion in comparison to x - ray luminosity .",
    "6 ) x - ray galaxy groups and optical galaxy groups from vdm are nearly similar in both redshift and velocity dispersion distributions . +",
    "we would like to thank david wilman , annie hou and antonis georgakakis for helpful discussions about the dynamical properties and agn contamination of x - ray groups .",
