    "the shape of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is of great importance in modern astrophysics .",
    "it plays a crucial role in many of the remaining ` big ' questions , e.g. , the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies . whether or not the imf is universal remains hotly contested ( e.g. , scalo 1998 , 2005 ; eisenhauer 2001 ; gilmore 2001 ; kroupa 2007 ; and references therein ) . obtaining the imf is challenging because stellar masses can not be measured directly , while limitations due to the observational technology used affect accurate analysis of , particularly , the low - mass stars .",
    "star clusters , both open and globular clusters , represent ideal objects to address many astronomical problems because all of their member stars have the same age and metallicity and are located roughly at the same distance .",
    "much work has been done on the mfs of globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way .",
    "paresce et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the mfs of galactic gcs are best approximated by a lognormal function , based on their analysis of the mfs of a dozen galactic gcs for stellar masses below 1 m@xmath4 .",
    "however , since all galactic gcs are old ( @xmath7 gyr , with typical relaxation times of @xmath8 gyr ) , they can only provide evolutionary information on a single ( long ) time - scale ; stellar and dynamical evolution must obviously have affected the mf at high masses ( e.g. , de grijs et al .",
    "2002a , b ) .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , on the other hand , is a unique laboratory for studying star cluster evolution on a range of time - scales as it contains a large population of rich star clusters with masses similar to those of galactic gcs and covering ages from 0.001 to 10 gyr ( e.g. , beaulieu et al .",
    "1999 ; elson et al .",
    "1999 ) , thus making it possible to study clusters at ( almost ) all evolutionary stages . particularly for the rich , young clusters , stellar and dynamical evolution have not yet affected the mf at low masses , so we can attempt to obtain the low - mass imf of these young clusters from their present - day mass functions ( pdmfs ) .",
    "the unprecedented high spatial resolution of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ allows us to resolve individual stars in dense star clusters at the distance of the lmc , @xmath050 kpc .",
    ".fundamental parameters of ngc 1818 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results rely on the assumption that the cluster s mass function consists of single stars .",
    "this seems a reasonable assumption because the effect of unresolved binarity is expected to be very small .",
    "kerber & santiago ( 2006 ) analysed the effect of binaries on mfs containing different binary fractions and characterised by different mf slopes with @xmath9 down to 0.8 .",
    "our slope corresponds to @xmath9=0.54 .",
    "the binary fraction at these low masses is poorly known .",
    "marchal et al.(2003 ) and delfosse et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtained a binary fraction of about 30 per cent for this low - mass range .",
    "l. kerber ( priv",
    "kindly recomputed the tests done in kerber & santiago ( 2006 ) and added a binary fraction of 30 per cent , with @xmath9 down to 0.4 .",
    "the resulting mf ( which is , strictly speaking , a system mf and not a single - star mf ) characterised by a binary fraction of 30 per cent is identical to one with no binarity over the entire stellar mass range of interest , _ within the uncertainties associated with our results , _ so that we conclude that binarity does not play a crucial role in our results , for neither random pairing nor constant mass - ratio binaries .",
    "( clearly , binaries will affect the final mass function , but the effect is expected to be small or negligible in relation to the uncertainties .",
    "hu et al . [ 2009 ] derived @xmath060 per cent binarity for ngc 1818 for the more massive f - type stars . )",
    "we used iraf / apphot for our photometry , leaving the ` sharpness ' and ` roundness ' parameters  used to weed out non - astronomical objects  to the default values , as this resulted in a ` clean ' sample of stars in our field of view .",
    "hu et al . (",
    "2009 ) appropriately adopted background fields observed with wfpc2 to subtract the background of their wfpc2 data .",
    "although we could not obtain background cmds of similar depth as our stis observations , the wfpc2 and stis fields cover a common area on the cmd ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we carefully compared the loci in common of the cmds obtained from the various observations ( i.e. , science data and background fields ) and found that there were few stars beyond the main - sequence ridge line of the background field .",
    "we therefore adopted an appropriate method to extend the mf of background to a similar depth as the stis observations ( see details in section 3.2 ) , i.e. , our background subtraction was done as properly as possible with the data at hand and hence any remaining malmquist bias is expected to be minimal .",
    "the stellar mass - dependent dynamical properties of ngc 1818 were discussed by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2002b ) . the half - mass relaxation time - scale of cluster stars with masses below 1.0 m@xmath4 is of order a few times @xmath10 to @xmath11 yr , i.e. , much greater than the age of the cluster .",
    "although dynamical evolution in the cluster core may be up to 10 to 20 times faster ( cf .",
    "de grijs et al .",
    "2002b ) , at the half - mass radius the stis data used here probe a relatively quiescent , representative sample of stellar masses that will have been affected negligibly by dynamical evolution .",
    "note that the loss of some small fraction of low - mass stars in unavoidable , even on the relatively short time - scale probed here .",
    "however , given the relatively small mass range probed by our stis observations , it is unclear to what extent ( if any ) this is important nor whether to expect a differential effect as a function of stellar mass ( e.g. , kroupa 2008 , his section 3.2 ) .",
    "this is the first time , to our knowledge , that anyone has probed the stellar mf to such low masses in an extragalactic , low - metallicity environment .",
    "this makes it difficult to compare our results with other relevant publications .",
    "however , we note that paresce et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the imf of galactic gcs is best fit by a lognormal function , a result based on analysis of the imf below 1 m@xmath4 of a dozen gcs in the milky way .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with chabrier ( 2003 ) . in an extragalactic environment ,",
    "chiosi et al . (",
    "2007 ) studied the imf of three young clusters in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , but their observations did not allow them to probe down to similarly low masses as done in this paper ; they only reach stellar masses down to @xmath00.7 m@xmath4 . however , da rio et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently probed the stellar mass function of the stellar association lh 95 in the lmc down to 0.43 m@xmath2 and found a similar broken power - law mf based on their _ hst _ data .",
    "we emphasize that the mfs based on the youngest and oldest age constraints do not reflect the true underlying mass distribution , but they provide a robust handle on the uncertainties associated with our mf analysis ( including the expected effects of the cluster s binary stellar population ; cf .",
    "hu et al . 2009 ) . instead , the mf for log(age yr@xmath12 ) = 7.25 ( middle panel of fig .",
    "9 ) is much closer to true mass distribution .",
    "it follows a power - law distribution with a slope of @xmath13 for masses @xmath14 m@xmath4 ; the mf follows the salpeter mass distribution for masses @xmath15 m@xmath4 ( figs . 7 and 8) .",
    ", which is identical within the uncertainties . ]",
    "although general agreement exists regarding a ` universal ' salpeter - like stellar imf for masses greater than @xmath01.0 m@xmath4 in any environment that is sufficiently well populated ( e.g. , kroupa 2001 , 2007 ; chabrier 2003 ; chiosi et al . 2007 ) , few studies have managed to constrain the imf well below 1 m@xmath4 ( cf .",
    "paresce et al .",
    "2000 ; kroupa 2001 , 2007 ; chiosi et al . 2007 ; covey et al .",
    "most current low - mass imf studies find broken power - law or lognormal mass distributions ; the exact functional form of the low - mass imf is still a matter of debate , however .",
    "kroupa ( 2001 ) studied the galactic - field imf down to 0.01 m@xmath4 and found a three - part power - law distribution with turnovers at @xmath00.08 and @xmath16 m@xmath2 ( see also covey et al . 2008 ) .",
    "chiosi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) obtain a similar mass function from their analysis of three clusters in the smc .",
    "andersen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) combine the low - mass stellar mass distributions for seven star - forming regions and conclude that the composite imf is consistent with a lognomal mass function .    our mf slope for ngc 1818 above 1.0 m@xmath4 ( see figs .",
    "7 and 8 and details in de grijs et al .",
    "2002b ) is consistent with a ` universal ' kroupa imf . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the mf slope we find for lower masses ( @xmath171.0 m@xmath2 ) is similar to that of kroupa ( 2001 ) , supporting a possible ` universal ' low - mass imf as well .",
    "given the intrinsic fluctuations in ngc 1818 and the associated uncertainties , its turn - over mass is fully consistent with the equivalent mass of 0.5 m@xmath2 suggested by kroupa ( 2001 ) .",
    "the resolution in mass of our data is insufficient to speculate on the cause of any differences .",
    "we re - emphasize here that a satisfactory fit to the low - mass imf of ngc 1818 can also be obtained on the basis of a lognormal mass function , although significantly broader than the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "application of different ml relations will result in different masses .",
    "6 we see that for masses greater than 0.63 m@xmath4 the three ml relations for ngc 1818 are similar , implying that the shape of the mfs for different age assumptions is similar ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . for masses below 0.63 m@xmath4",
    "the three ml relations are parallel .",
    "the shape derived from models of different ages should therefore be the same within the uncertainties , although the number of stars in each mass interval is different . from figs . 5 and 9 we find that the shapes of the mfs for different ages are similar , but the slopes vary to some extent .",
    "although we derived the ngc 1818 mf from 0.15 to 1.25 m@xmath4 in this paper , this is not necessarily the _ initial _ mf as evolutionary effects , such as ( dynamical ) mass segregation ( de grijs et al . 2002a , b , c )",
    ", may have modified the cluster s imf .",
    "however , given that ngc 1818 is very young ( @xmath045 myr ) , stellar and dynamical evolution will not have affected the imf significantly at the lowest masses .",
    "in addition , the location of the common wfpc2/stis area is far outside the crowded centre of ngc 1818 so that dynamical evolution is unlikely to have modified the imf to any significant extent at these radii and we can therefore confidently consider the observed mf of the low - mass stars in ngc 1818 as its imf .",
    "in this paper we use deep _ hst _ wfpc2 and stis photometry of the rich young cluster ngc 1818 in the lmc to derive the stellar mf for low - mass stars down to @xmath1 m@xmath2 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the deepest mf thus far obtained for a stellar system in an extragalactic , low - metallicity environment ( although somewhat  but not quite  rivalled by the recent work of da rio et al . 2009 ) .    combining our results with the mf for stellar masses above 1.0 m@xmath4 derived by de grijs et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , we obtain a complete pdmf of ngc 1818 .",
    "this pdmf is most likely a good representation of the cluster s imf , particularly at low masses .",
    "this is so because ngc 1818 is very young and the observations are centred on a field at the cluster s uncrowded half - mass radius , so that stellar and dynamical evolution of the cluster is unlikely to have significantly affected the ngc 1818 imf at low masses .",
    "adopting a kroupa - type power - law mass distribution as a convenient fitting tool , the imf in ngc 1818 is best described by a broken power - law distribution with slopes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( salpeter - like ) for masses in the range from 0.15 to 0.8 m@xmath4 and greater than 0.8 m@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "our derived imf is therefore fully consistent , within the uncertainties , with the ` standard ' kroupa ( 2001 ) broken power - law imf for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "given the observational uncertainties , the low - mass imf is also well approximated by a lognormal distribution . at the present time , we can not robustly distinguish between either functional form . to do so",
    ", one would need to probe down to the stellar / brown - dwarf transition region .",
    "this is , however , very challenging to achieve for clusters at magellanic cloud distances .",
