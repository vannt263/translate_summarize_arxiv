    "the nucleon electromagnetic ( em ) form factors are the fundamental objects for understanding their internal structure .",
    "the internal structures of the nucleon are usually described in terms of the electromagnetic dirac and pauli form factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 or equivalently the electric and magnetic dipole sachs form factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ( for a recent status of experiments and phenomenology of the form factors see @xcite ) .",
    "until a few years ago , the nucleon electromagnetic form factors are studied in unpolarized elastic electron - nucleon scattering through a virtual photon exchange .",
    "it is shown in the pioneering work @xcite that the polarization effects , i.e. , scattering of polarized electrons from polarized target , can play essential role for a more accurate determination of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that , unlike the unpolarized elastic cross section , which is proportional to the sum of squares of the form factors , the polarized cross section contains also interference terms of the form factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 . studying various polarization observables allows more accurate determination of these form factors .",
    "recent developments in experimental instruments allow to produce polarized electron beams and polarized protons , which gives the opportunity for a more precise separation of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 form factors .",
    "the electron - proton scattering experiments , which are performed at jefferson laboratory using the polarized electrons and polarized proton , show strong deviation from the theoretical predictions @xcite , i.e. , the ratio @xmath4 does not behave as is expected from previous experiments and as is predicted by the perturbative qcd ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) . for understanding this unexpected result , some model - independent non perturbative method is needed . among all existing nonperturbative approaches",
    "qcd sum rule is more attractive and powerful , because it is based on the fundamental qcd lagrangian .",
    "the goal of our work is the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of nucleon using the light cone qcd sum rule ( lcqsr ) and most general form of the interpolating current for nucleon . in this approach",
    "the form factors of the nucleons are expressed in terms of distribution amplitude of the nucleon .",
    "note that , this problem is investigated for the ioffe current in the framework of the lcqsr in @xcite and the traditional sum rules in @xcite . in @xcite , an improved version of the chernyak ",
    "zhitnitsky current is used .",
    "the paper is organized in following way . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the result for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the lcqsr method .",

    "another set of nucleon form factors is the so called sachs form factors , which are defined in terms of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14 at the static limit , values at @xmath15 are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron in units of the bohr magneton .",

    "the electromagnetic current is : @xmath29 and the choice @xmath30 corresponds to the ioffe current .",
    "the main idea of the lcqsr method is to calculate the correlation function in terms of the form factors at hadron level , as well as in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom . equating two representations of the correlation function and performing a borel transformation in order to suppress the contributions of the higher states and continuum , we get sum rules for the em form factors of the nucleon .",
    "let us first calculate the physical part of the correlator ( [ t ] ) .",
    "the contribution of the nucleon to the correlation function ( [ t ] ) is given by @xmath31 the matrix element @xmath32 in ( [ phys1 ] ) is determined in the following way : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coupling constant of the nucleon to the current @xmath35 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath36 is parameterized in terms of the form factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 via eq . ( [ matrixel1 ] ) . summing over spins of the nucleons @xmath37 and using eqs .",

    "only set1 for @xmath30 describes quite successfully the existing experimental data .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , as an example on the dependence of the predictions on @xmath88 , we present the dependence of proton magnetic form factor normalized to the dipole form factor @xmath97 on @xmath93 , for both sets of da s at two fixed values of @xmath98 .",
    "it follows from this graph that , in the chosen region of @xmath88 , i.e. in the region @xmath90 , the form factor @xmath112 is practically insensitive to the variation of @xmath88 . in conclusion , in present work , we calculate the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using the most general form of the nucleon interpolating current in the light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "the sum rules for these form factors are obtained . using two forms of the da s , we calculate sum rules predictions for these form factors and compare them with existing experimental data .",
    "we obtain that our results are in a good agreement with the existing experimental data .",
    "more precisely , at different values of @xmath88 , our results for the form factors reproduce the experimental data .",
    "finally , we obtained the `` working region for @xmath88 '' .",
    "our final remark is that in order to answer to the question which @xmath88 is more preferable , both theoretical and experimental studies have to be refined . from theoretical part",
    "@xmath113 corrections to the distributions amplitudes and more accurate determination of the da s are needed . from experimental data , the discrepencies between various data has to be eliminated .",
