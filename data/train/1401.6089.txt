    "disordered face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 and fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 alloys have received considerable attention due to their intriguing physical properties . for instance , their spontaneous volume magnetostriction , @xmath10 , which measures the relative deviation of the equilibrium volume with respect to the volume in a paramagnetic state , is anomalously large at @xmath11 compared to a typical ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their reduced magnetostriction , @xmath12 , scales with the square of their reduced magnetization , @xmath13^{2}$ ] , up to a temperature near the curie temperature , @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "one of the greatest challenges in condensed matter theory today lies in understanding all of the abovementioned phenomena within one framework .    over the years",

    "one strand in the literature favours the so - called 2@xmath18-state model , where the iron atoms can switch between two magnetic states with different atomic volumes as the temperature is raised @xcite .",

    ", we turn to address the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down and proceed as follows .",

    "second , we assume @xmath56 \\bigg [ 1- \\left ( \\frac{t}{t_{\\rm c } } \\right)^{p } \\bigg]^{q}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that realizing this scheme requires the prior knowledge of the reduced magnetization as a function of the reduced temperature , the dimensionless quantity @xmath57 , and the fraction of fe moments which point down at @xmath11 .    results , which can be found in this paper and recent theoretical studies @xcite , provide some physical justification for the abovementioned hypothesis . as shown in section  [ results ] , the zero - temperature magnetization @xmath46 decays linearly with increasing @xmath22 in the range @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the specific power law behaviour displayed by the reduced magnetization [ see ( [ eqn4 ] ) ] may reflect the thermal evolution of @xmath22 .",
    "however , ( [ eqn4 ] ) is constructed to obey bloch s 3/2 power law at low temperatures and we expect the term proportional to @xmath59 in this equation to be related to spin - wave excitations .",
    "we therefore deliberately exclude such a term from ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , according to the ising model @xcite , @xmath22 increases continuously upon heating the system and , in the limit @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "this is exactly what we expect to find for fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 from the modified weiss model @xcite .",
    "combining the above findings leads to the simple relationship  ( [ eqn5 ] ) .    in the third and final step , we combine the output from the previous steps to explore how the magnetization @xmath62 $ ] and the magnetostriction @xmath63 = \\frac{v [ x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow}(t ) ] - v ( 1/2)}{v(1/2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] vary as the system is heated .",

    "it has been studied previously @xcite and its strong value in fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 has been linked to the substantial change undergone by the magnitude of fe moments on switching the magnetic state from dlm to fm @xcite .",
    "the product of the two first terms represents the magnetostriction that would display the material if its volume @xmath45 were given by ( [ eqn1 ] ) in @xmath6 .",

    "we note in passing that @xmath9 may reach high values in fe - rich fe@xmath32ni@xmath33 such as 0.33 for @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "based on this analysis , we claim that the anomalies can be traced back to the combination of two zero - temperature properties : the volume in the fm state greatly exceeds that in the dlm state and the fraction of fe moments which point down is close to 0 .    over the last few decades",
    ", several arguments have been put forward to justify the unusual thermal evolution of the reduced magnetization reported in some invar systems , including anomalous spin - wave damping mechanism @xcite and anomalous average magnitude of fe moments @xcite .",
    "however , high - resolution inelastic neutron scattering data contradict the first argument ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , while the second scenario is difficult to reconcile with the absence of noticeable anomaly in the @xmath22 dependence of the average fe moment , @xmath105 [ figure  [ figure2](b ) ] . in this regard",
    ", we emphasize that @xmath105 represents the only contribution to @xmath92 associated with fe sites [ equation  ( [ eqn6 ] ) ] .",
    "to advance the matter further , we plot in figure  [ figure5 ] the calculated reduced magnetization that would exhibit fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 if its fraction of fe moments which point down matched that of fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 . in this case , the data for the former alloy mimic the behaviour of the latter .",
    "this substantiates our claim that the anomaly detected in the reduced magnetization in fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 arises from the peculiar thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down .",
    "figure  [ figure6 ] is the analog of figure  [ figure5 ] for the reduced magnetostriction .",
    "it reveals that if the fraction of fe moments which point down of fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 were substituted by that of fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 ( see hatched symbols ) , the data for the former alloy would follow closely the behaviour of the latter .",
    "thus , the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down can account for the observed marked difference in the temperature dependence of the reduced magnetostriction between the two alloys .",
    "the reduced magnetization in fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence , unlike in fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 . for this reason , experimental evidence that the reduced magnetostriction decreases proportionally to the square of the reduced magnetization in each of these alloys as the system under study",
    "is heated from @xmath11 up to a temperature near @xmath14 may come as a surprise . explaining these results could help unravel the mechanism behind magnetostructural coupling in transition metals and their alloys .",
    "we propose below the first investigation of the origin of these remarkable phenomena using the dft .",
    "we first note that @xmath106 } { w_{\\rm s}[x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow}(0 ) ] } = \\frac { m^{2 } [ x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow}(t ) ] } { m^{2 } [ x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow}(0 ) ] } \\lambda \\mu \\ { 1 + \\epsilon[x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow}(t ) ] \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath108 } { m^{2}(0 ) } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111/m(0 ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus if @xmath9 were zero , @xmath46 were given by ( [ eqn2 ] ) , and @xmath45 were given by ( [ eqn1 ] ) in @xmath6 , then the reduced magnetostriction would match the reduced magnetization squared over the whole range @xmath4 .",
    "taking into account this finding , our _ ab initio _",
    "results for @xmath92 and @xmath70 displayed in figures  [ figure2 ] and  [ figure1 ] , and the experimental data for @xmath9 mentioned in section  [ results b ] , we argue that common features observed experimentally in the relationship between the magnetization and the magnetostriction in fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 and fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 below their curie temperature can originate from the fact that both alloys exhibit similar _ zero - temperature _ properties : their magnetization and their volume in a pdlm state follow closely ( [ eqn2 ] ) and ( [ eqn1 ] ) and their fraction of fe moments which point down is close to 0 .",
    "to address the magnetization , the magnetostriction , and their relationship in disordered fcc fe@xmath0pt@xmath1 and fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 in the temperature interval @xmath4 , we develop a method in which each of the alloys in equilibrium at temperature @xmath25 is modelled by a random substitutional alloy in a fm , pdlm , or dlm state depending on @xmath26 .",
    "the method consists of three stages .    as a first step ,",
    "we perform dft calculations of the magnetization and the volume at @xmath11 in fm , pdlm , and dlm states . in the second step , we turn to the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down . to achieve this goal , we rely on the fact that an accurate description of the reduced magnetization is provided by ( [ eqn4 ] ) .",
    "we also assume that the function @xmath22 obeys ( [ eqn5 ] ) . in the third and final step , we combine the output from the previous steps to explore how the magnetization and the magnetostriction vary as the system is heated .",
    "our method appears to us sufficiently robust so that our following conclusions will remain unaffected .",
    "the alloys at @xmath11 share several physical properties : the magnetization in a pdlm state collapses as the fraction of fe moments which point down increases , following closely ( [ eqn2 ] ) , while the volume shrinks , following closely ( [ eqn1 ] ) ; the volume in the fm state greatly exceeds that in the dlm state ; @xmath9 is close to 0 . these common properties can account for a variety of intriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys , including the anomaly in the magnetostriction at @xmath11 and , more surprisingly perhaps , the scaling between the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared below the curie temperature .",
    "however , the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration .",
    "this , in turn , can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature dependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys .",

    "<S> the alloys at zero kelvin share several physical properties : the volume in a partially disordered local moment state shrinks as the fraction of fe moments which point down increases in the interval @xmath6 , following closely @xmath7 x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow } ( 1-x^{{\\rm fe}\\downarrow})$ ] , while the magnetization collapses , following closely @xmath8 ; the volume in the homogeneous ferromagnetic state greatly exceeds that in the disordered local moment state ; @xmath9 is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> these common properties can account for a variety of intriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys , including the anomaly in the magnetostriction at zero kelvin and , more surprisingly perhaps , the scaling between the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared below the curie temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the thermal evolution of the fraction of fe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature dependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys . </S>"
