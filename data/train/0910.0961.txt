    "in ecological and social systems , game theoretical models have been immensely successful and have emerged as a standard models in certain cases .",
    "one of the interesting applications of game theory in these systems has been explanation of emergence of co - operative behavior .",
    "it was suggested that cooperation could be sustained if there is repeated interaction and spatial structure .",
    "prisoner s dilemma on a lattice has emerged as a paradigm in this context @xcite .",
    "we will be analyzing a stochastic variant of the same in this work .",
    "`` prisoner s dilemma '' ( pd ) is an interesting problem in game theory where cooperation between agents is strictly dominated by defecting and the possible equilibrium is that everyone defects .",
    "this is despite the fact that cooperation will lead to better average payoff for everyone .",
    "however , cooperation can arise in an iterated version of the game .",
    "this happens mainly due to threat of punishment for defection in the next round . if game theory in traditional sense is applied to social system and if we assume common knowledge and perfect rationality for each agent , cooperation is not a viable option .",
    "refining these assumptions makes cooperation possible . in iterated games on a lattice , agents have knowledge only about their nearest neighbors and the interaction is repeated .",
    "cooperation is indeed observed in these models .",
    "thus it is claimed that the emergence of cooperation , which seems counterintuitive in the context of darwinian evolution but observed in several biological and social contexts , is explained by this model . in evolutionary games ,",
    "the strategies are built in trial - and - error fashion and more successful strategies are preferred in course of time .",
    "this procedure leads to dynamics automatically .",
    "obviously , societies comprise of several agents who interact through a complex network of acquaintances .",
    "this fact has motivated the analysis of iterated version of pd on variety of networks .",
    "these studies have interesting consequences in the social , biological and economic systems @xcite .",
    "the choice of underlying network depends on the problem being addressed . in this work ,",
    "we study the pd on a two dimensional lattice .",
    "the reason is that evolutionary games on 2-d networks is a relevant and popular choice for several biological networks @xcite .",
    "( we must mention that recently other spatial structures have also received a fair share of attention @xcite . )",
    "an extensive survey of modeling using game theoretical models in ecology can be found in a recent book @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on studying various phases in this system and nature of dynamic phase transitions between these phases .",
    "in this model , the agents sitting on the nodes of two - dimensional lattice update their strategies in a synchronous manner and payoffs are computed using the payoff matrix of pd .",
    "the major finding is that on introduction of spatial structure , there is emergence of cooperative behavior among selfish individuals @xcite .",
    "however , this model was strongly criticized by huberman and glance and also by mukherji _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "they studied the robustness of these results with respect to stochastic fluctuations and concluded that several of the conclusions do not hold in presence of stochastic fluctuations .",
    "one stochastic variant studied in both these works has been relaxation of requirement of synchronous update . in modeling physical phenomena ,",
    "it is difficult to say whether synchronous updating scheme is more natural than asynchronous scheme or vice versa . models of traffic flow have more realistic properties if updated in synchronous mode @xcite .",
    "however , if we are modeling physical phenomena in realm of equilibrium statistical physics , asynchronous updates offer better results @xcite .",
    "there could be phenomena where an intermediate mode could be more realistic . in above model",
    ", certain degree of asynchronicity in updating strategies is relevant and possible and this variant is studied in detail in this work .",
    "we note that the differences between synchronous and asynchronous updates have been a topic of recent interest in statistical physics community . apart from game theory @xcite",
    ", it is studied in the contexts of boolean networks @xcite , coupled map @xcite , neural networks @xcite , monte carlo processes @xcite and biological networks @xcite .",
    "it has even been studied in the context of equilibrium models @xcite such as ising model . in above work , nonequilibrium phase transition , induced by introducing semi - synchronous updating in ising model , is studied . in the context of game theory",
    ", there is a clear physical motivation for such study since it is unlikely that even a strategy with slightly more payoff is deterministically copied by everyone .",
    "certain degree of stochasticity in updating of strategies is indeed possible in these systems .",
    "thus there is need for a detailed study of systems which do not evolve in a fully synchronous or asynchronous manner .",
    "hence , we make a detailed study of the evolution for semi - synchronous update where @xmath0 members update strategy every instant in pd on a lattice .    for completeness",
    ", we define the 2-person pd game in its classic form : this game describes the confrontation between two players , each of whom may choose either to cooperate ( strategy @xmath2 ) , or defect ( strategy @xmath3 ) , at any confrontation . if both players choose @xmath2 , they get a pay - off of magnitude @xmath4 each ; if one player chooses to @xmath3 while the other chooses @xmath2 , the defector player gets the biggest pay - off @xmath5 , while the other gets @xmath6 ; if both players defect , they get pay - off @xmath7 . in this game",
    ", the pay - off values must satisfy the inequalities @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for such choice of parameters ,",
    "the paradox is evident .",
    "each player is tempted to defect , but they would be worse off if both defected and total payoff for both together would be higher if they co - operated in stead .",
    "however , best payoff for an individual player is obtained when he defects while the other player cooperated .    in ecological context , nowak and",
    "may simulated this system with choice of parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "they believe that most of the interesting behavior is reproduced for this choice of parameters .",
    "they studied the pd on a two dimensional array with synchronous updating .",
    "they explored the asymptotic behavior of the game for various values of the @xmath14 . here",
    "players interact with their local neighbors through simple deterministic rules and have no memory of past .",
    "they found that , the dynamical behavior of the system depends on the parameter b. for a range of values of @xmath14 @xmath12 , system reaches a steady state with a non - zero fraction of cooperators .",
    "they concluded that spatial structure and repeated interactions promote cooperation in the pd .",
    "this synchronous updating came in for heavy criticism .",
    "it was argued that , the global clock in the social systems are very rare and the probability of two events evolve exactly at same time has measure zero .",
    "it was also argued that more realistic modeling would involve updating the system by individual .",
    "thus only one player should be updated at each time step .",
    "this type of updating is called asynchronous update .",
    "as we mention previously , huberman and glance studied pd game with same parameters of nowak and may under the asynchronous updating rule @xcite . a similar argument",
    "was made by mukherji _",
    "_ @xcite and masaki and mitsuo @xcite . in this case",
    ", the system rapidly converges to steady state where all the players become defectors .",
    "they argued that the previous results about emergence of cooperation are not generic .",
    "nowak et al @xcite , replied that if they study the behavior in entire parameter space , cooperation is observed even for asynchronous update for some choice of parameters .",
    "they found that , the two updating rules are similar for a some values of @xmath14 , but for @xmath15 the two updating rules lead to different steady states .",
    "they also argued that discrete time is appropriate for many biological situations where interaction phase is followed by reproduction phase .",
    "thus synchronous update is more relevant and realistic biologically .",
    "however , neither completely synchronous nor completely asynchronous updating is realistic in natural processes and there are bound to be stochastic fluctuations in updating .",
    "there have been attempts to interpolate between these two cases @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we make a detailed study of pd on a 2-d lattice with semi - synchronous updates from the viewpoint of statistical physics and investigate how generic the results are .",
    "we will make a detailed study of the observed phases for semi - synchronous update and present a phase diagram .",
    "the phases of interest in this system are an all - defector state and a mixed phase with cooperators and defectors .",
    "in particular , we will study the transition between these two phases as a dynamic phase transition .    in statistical physics , a lot of effort",
    "is devoted for finding the order of transitions and critical exponents in case of continuous phase transitions .",
    "the reason is that the critical behavior lets us distinguish between essential and not so essential details of the system .",
    "idea of universality in the theory of phase transitions has allowed us to see how seemingly disparate models have common underlying features .",
    "thus it is important to study the transitions in detail .",
    "all agents becoming @xmath2 or @xmath3 , is an absorbing state while coexistence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be considered as an active phase .",
    "hence , this system characterized by two absorbing state , all defectors state and all cooperators state . it has been long argued for that all one component systems undergoing from active phase transition to a unique absorbing state have a phase transition in the class of directed percolation ( dp ) if the order parameter is a scalar and there are no extra symmetries or conservation laws and the interaction through short - range @xcite . also , most system with multiple absorbing state found to fall in the dp class @xcite",
    ". we will study the veracity of this conjecture .",
    "firstly we need to establish the order of the transition .",
    "the first ( second ) order phase transitions in equilibrium systems are characterized by discontinuities in the first ( second ) derivatives of free energy e.g. , the internal energy and order parameter .",
    "this singularities at a first order phase transition are due to phase coexistence and there are no critical exponents .    for pd game system , it was found that , for different choice of updating rule transition to all - defector state on variation of parameter @xmath14 is in the class of directed percolation @xcite .",
    "we will study the nowak and may s system under the variation of probability @xmath1 of update .",
    "_ we observe that the transition is not continuous .",
    "_ we must also mention that there are several known exceptions in nonequilibrium systems which exhibit a discontinuous transition to absorbing state @xcite .",
    "our updating strategy is as follows .",
    "we allow every player to update his strategy with probability @xmath1 in each monte carlo step .",
    "under variation of this probability from @xmath16 ( asynchronous ) to @xmath17 ( synchronous ) in thermodynamic limit , we study the effect of the updating scheme on the behavior of the system . in second section of the paper",
    ", we establish that the transition is indeed a first order transition . in the third section ,",
    "we carry out a damage spreading analysis to study the dynamical phase digram and critical behavior .",
    "we investigate pd on the two dimensional lattice of size @xmath18 with evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the agents on each site of lattice can choose only two strategies @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to defector while @xmath2 corresponds to cooperator .",
    "( the defectors and cooperators have also been viewed as dead and living sites in some applications . )",
    "we employ fixed boundary conditions and assume that the agents have no memory of the past .",
    "initial configuration consists of @xmath20 defectors and @xmath21 cooperators distributed randomly on the lattice .",
    "( we checked other initial conditions as well .",
    "we varied the density of defectors between @xmath22 to @xmath23 and found that the asymptotic stationary state did not change . )",
    "every agent interacts with eight nearest neighbors and self .",
    "we set the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "the pay - off matrix is +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    we tabulate values of @xmath25 in table [ table1 ] using eq .",
    "6 . while the fractal dimension @xmath25 is found very close to @xmath26 for synchronous update(@xmath17 )",
    ", it deviates appreciably for smaller values of @xmath1 . for the value of @xmath1 near the critical point @xmath27 ,",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath25 is smaller .",
    "we find that the damage spreading near the critical point is certainly a fractal object . on the other hand , the snapshot in fig .",
    "12 shows that for synchronous update ( @xmath17 ) , the damage spreading is approximately compact .",
    "thus the damage spreading is fractal near the critical point and compact for synchronous update .",
    "( a ) snapshot of damaged lattice sites at @xmath28 for @xmath29.(b ) snapshot of damaged lattice sites at @xmath28 for @xmath30 .",

    "the initial damage is of one site at the center of @xmath31 lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]",
    "we have studied the pd on a @xmath32 lattice with an update rule which interpolates between asynchronous and synchronous update as a function of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "here each agent updates the strategy with probability @xmath1 at each timestep .",
    "we observe that , this system crosses from mixed ( active ) phase to all defector ( absorbing ) phase when we vary the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we studied the time evolution of this system and found that this system exhibits long lived metastable state near the critical point .",
    "the order parameter of this system shows a clear jump at the critical point .",
    "we carry out detailed quantitative analysis to show that the the above transition s a first order transition .",
    "we confirm this result by studying the average lifetime of metastable state , binder cumulant and hysteresis effect .",
    "the damage spreading technique is useful tool to study the sensitivity of the system dynamics on the initial condition .",
    "a damage spreading analysis of semi - synchronous update leads to the conclusion that , the active phase is chaotic and the transition in this system is as same the frozen chaotic transition .",
    "the damage spreading inside the active phase ( far from critical point ) is compact .",
