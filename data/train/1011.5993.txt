    "seyfert galaxies are relatively moderate luminosity ( @xmath8 ergs@xmath9 ) , local ( @xmath10 ) agn . historically , they have been classified based on their optical spectra , with seyfert 1s possessing broad permitted lines ( full width at half maximum [ fwhm ] @xmath11 few 1000 km s@xmath9 ) , narrower forbidden lines ( fwhm @xmath12 1000 km s@xmath9 ) and non - stellar continua , and seyfert 2s possessing permitted and forbidden lines of similar widths and optical continua dominated by the host galaxy ( khachikian & weedman 1974 ) .",
    "the discovery of polarized broad permitted lines and non - stellar continua in spectro - polarimetric observations of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , miller & antonucci 1983 ) led to the unified model for seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 ) , which posits that the central agn is surrounded by a dusty , molecular torus and the difference between the two types is due to our line of sight with respect to the torus .",
    "specifically , our view of the broad emission line region and central continuum source in seyfert 2s is blocked by the torus in the above picture .",
    "the forbidden lines detected in seyfert galaxies arise from the so - called narrow - line region ( nlr ) which may extend from 1pc to several hundred pcs from the central source . based on narrow - band [ o  iii ] images , originally from ground - based observations ( pogge 1988a , b ; 1989 ) and , subsequently images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",

    ", one would expect that the seyfert 1s and 2s would exhibit similar nlr emission - line properties , while their structure should depend primarily on viewing angle , with seyfert 1s being more symmetric and compact . while the latter is generally the case",

    ", one might conclude that the extinction is heaviest towards the inner regions of the nlr .",
    "one open question is whether the extinction is due to dust associated with the agn , either the torus or the nlr , or dust in the host galaxy .",
    "keel ( 1980 ) found a deficiency of seyfert 1s in nearly edge - on hosts and suggested that seyfert galaxies have larger bulges or thicker disks than normal spiral galaxies .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) found more seyfert 1.8s and 1.9s in edge - on systems , hence the reddening of emission from the blr , which would suppress the broad balmer lines , could be due to dust in the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "schmitt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also noted a lack of seyfert 1s in edge - on systems .",
    "hence , one aim of this paper to to isolate the effect of reddening due to gas associated with the agn , rather than within the plane of the host galaxy . beyond that",
    ", we will determine how much of the [ o  iii ] emission is undetected in seyfert 2s , and , finally , constrain the column densities of the gas outside the optical emission line bicone .",
    "in order to determine if there are significant differences in the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios of seyfert galaxies , we require a sample that includes a sufficient number of seyfert 1s and 2s that our results are not biased , e.g. , by small number statistics . to begin with , we included agn for the revised shapley - ames sample with irs spectra analyzed by diamond - stanic et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and from the 12@xmath0 m sample , with irs spectra analyzed by tomassin et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) . since both of these samples are weighted towards seyfert 2s , we added sources from the 22-month bat sample ( tueller et al .",
    "2010 ) with irs spectra analyzed by melndez et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "we stress the point that this is not intended to be a complete , unbiased sample .",
    "however , as we will show , the range in [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios and the dependence of this ratio on seyfert classification is similar to that observed in other studies .    one goal of this study is to isolate the effects of dust associated with the host galaxy from that associated with the nlr .",
    "the first step was to eliminate from our sample merging systems and those designated as residing in peculiar host galaxies , based on the galaxy morphologies from the rc3.9 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the remaining agn include : 53 seyfert 2s , 30 seyfert 1s , 15 seyfert 1.8/1.9s ( `` intermediate '' seyferts ) , and 8 liners ( see tables 1  4 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the [ o  iv ] fluxes are found in the references cited in the tables , but are generally @xmath7 10% . while uncertainties in the [ o  iii ] fluxes are rarely given , peterson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) find that seeing variations in typical ground - based spectroscopy of agn can result in photometric errors as large as 20% .",
    "we therefore assume that our [ o  iii ] fluxes are uncertain at this level . in figure 1",
    ", we show the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratio as a function of the [ o  iv ] luminosity , which can be used as a proxy for the intrinsic luminosity of the agn ( melndez et al . 2008a ; melndez , kraemer , & schmitt 2010 ) . as the plot shows , the sample smoothly spans more than four orders of magnitude in luminosity , hence we do not appear to be introducing obvious biases by including sources from different parent samples ( in particular , those from the bat sample , which includes more distant and luminous sources , see melndez et al .",
    "[ 2008a ] ) .",
    "it does appear , however , that lower luminosity objects , primarily liners , have somewhat higher [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios .",
    "as discussed in netzer ( 2009 ) , since the agn in liners are weak , they can not produce as much o@xmath22 as seyferts .",
    "furthermore , starlight may be the dominant form of ionization in liners ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2009 ) , which would also result in higher [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios .",
    "indeed , the one seyfert 1 in the low - ionization , high [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] region , mrk 352 , has [ ne  ii ] 12.81@xmath0m/[ne  iii ] 15.56 @xmath0 m @xmath7 1.6 ( weaver et al . 2010 ) , indicative of strong star formation ( e.g. , melndez et al .",
    "2008b ) , which could enhance [ o  iii ] .    from their study of _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectra of seyfert galaxies , deo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that the few objects in their sample that showed deep 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption were in highly inclined or merging systems .",
    "crenshaw & kraemer ( 2001 ) determined that the uv continuum reddening in seyfert 1s increases dramatically with the inclination of the host galaxy .",
    "this suggests that much of the extinction is due to dust the plane of the host galaxy . in figure 2",
    "we show the effect of inclination in the sample by plotting the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios versus the axial ratios ( @xmath23 ) of their host galaxies . following crenshaw & kraemer ( 2001 ) ,",
    "we have taken @xmath23 from ( in order of preference ) de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) , kirhakos & steiner ( 1990 ) , and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ( see tables 14 ) . while there is no strong correlation between [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] and @xmath23 for the sample ,",
    "there are clearly relatively fewer sources with [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] greater than unity in inclined host galaxies .",
    "therefore , in examining the effect of extinction associated with the nlr , we opt to only consider those seyfert galaxies in our sample in hosts with @xmath1 ( see , also , discussion in crenshaw & kraemer 2001 ) .",
    "our final sample includes 40 seyfert 2s and 26 seyfert 1s . in figure 2",
    ", one can clearly see that seyfert 1s , on average , have higher [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios than do seyfert 2s .",
    "due to the ionization effect discussed above , we do not include liners in the analysis .",
    "intermediate seyferts exhibit a range of properties ( e.g. goodrich 1995 ; trippe et al .",
    "2010 ) , including cases of weak agn / strong starformation , that can affect [ o  iii ] independent from extinction , hence we also exclude these from the analysis of the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios . however , they are included in our comparison with r@xmath13 and soft x - ray emission ( see section 4 ) .    one possible complication in comparing [ o  iv ] fluxes from _ spitzer _ with [ o  iii ] fluxes from ground - based observations is the aperture effect .",
    "for example , some seyfert galaxies show [ o  iii ] emission from an extended narrow line region ( enlr ) up to several kpc from the central source , ( e.g. pogge 1989 ) . for an object at a distance of 10 mpc , the approximate minimum distance to the seyfert 1 and 2s in the sample",
    ", 1 kpc corresponds to @xmath7 20@xmath24 , which could be outside the irs long - low or long - high apertures , with shorter dimensions of 105 and 111 , respectively ( houck et al . 2004 ) , depending on the orientation of the slit .",
    "however , as noted above , based on photoionization models , melndez et al .",
    "( 2008a ) determined that the bulk of the [ o  iv ] emission arises close to the agn , hence it is unlikely that the irs spectra have missed much of the flux .",
    "on the other hand , the [ o  iii ] fluxes used here come from a number of different ground - based observers ( see tables 1 4 ) , who employed slits of various dimensions . nevertheless , as demonstrated by schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , the [ o  iii ] profiles obtained _ hst_/wide field and planetary camera 2 narrow - band images of seyfert galaxies were strongly centrally peaked and , in most cases , there was a good agreement between the _ hst _ [ o  iii ] fluxes and values from ground - based observations ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "however , it is instructive to examine cases of nearby seyferts with bright enlrs .",
    "for example , in figure 3 , we show the radial profile of [ o  iii ] @xmath25007 , derived from a _",
    "slitless g430 m spectrum of ngc 4151 . in this case , the bulk of the [ o  iii ] lies within @xmath7 2@xmath24 of the central peak , hence it is reasonably certain that the ground - based observation by ho et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using a 2@xmath24x4@xmath24 aperture , captured most of the [ o  iii ] flux . for ngc 1068 , the [ o  iii ] flux measured by schmitt et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , within 4@xmath24 of the agn , is @xmath7 60% of the value obtained by bonatto & pastoriza ( 1997 ) through a 125x32 aperture , again indicating that the emission is centrally peaked . given that these two nlrs are close and extended , it is unlikely that aperture effects play a major role for the other agn in our sample .",
    "as another check , if there is , in general , significant [ o  iii ] from the enlr , one may expect a trend towards higher [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios with distance .",
    "however , as seen in figure 4 , the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratio is not correlated with distance , which confirms that there is no overall aperture effect within the sample .",
    "as mentioned above , several studies have noted that seyfert 2s have , on average , lower [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios than seyfert 1s , which is attributed to greater extinction towards the nlr in the former . with our reduced sample",
    ", we have attempted to account for the effects of peculiar morphologies or host galaxy inclination . in figure 5 , we show the distribution of the ratio for the seyfert 1s and 2s in the reduced sample , and the separation of the two classes is quite apparent .",
    "the number of objects in our reduced sample is marginally sufficient for a kolomogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to return meaningful results .",
    "the k - s test yields a @xmath25-statistic @xmath26 0.55 and a probability of the null hypothesis @xmath27 @xmath26 8.9 @xmath4 10@xmath28 , indicating that the two populations are different . a two - dimensional kuiper test of our reduced sample returns @xmath25 @xmath26 0.525 and @xmath29 , confirming the result of the k - s test .",
    "the mean [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] for the seyfert 1s ( excluding mrk 352 , see above ) is 2.01 , with a 95% confidence interval for the mean of 1.43  2.58 . for the seyfert 2s ,",
    "the mean is 0.97 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.60  1.26 .",
    "the ratio of the means is roughly the same found by lamassa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in comparing seyfert 2s from sdss to seyfert 1s in the revised shapley - ames sample ( diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ) . in order to determine the average excess extinction in seyfert 2s , we compared the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios for each object to the mean value for the seyfert 1s .",
    "we assumed @xmath30 , the extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , and a dust - to - gas ratio resulting in @xmath31 for n@xmath32 @xmath6 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "there were four seyfert 2s with ratios greater than the mean value for the seyfert 1s , namely , mcg@xmath3303@xmath3358@xmath337 , tol 1238@xmath33364 , ngc 1358 and ngc 4507 , so we did not include these sources in estimating the extinction ; we list the estimates for n@xmath20 for the rest in table 5 . for the seyfert 2s",
    ", we find an average reddening of 0.41@xmath34 0.27 mag , with the 95% confidence interval of 0.32  0.50 . the mean value for n@xmath20 @xmath26 2.1 @xmath35 @xmath6 , with the 95% confidence interval of 1.6  2.6 @xmath35 @xmath6 .",
    "the range is somewhat smaller than that found by melndez et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , which is likely due to the rejection of seyferts in inclined hosts .",
    "one caveat regarding estimates of reddening based on the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios is that it is likely , when the host galaxy is viewed at low inclination , that half of the nlr emission lies behind the galactic disk ( e.g. crenshaw et al .",
    "2010b ; fischer et al .",
    "therefore , depending on the amount of dust in the disk , there can be significant extinction of the [ o  iii ] .",
    "interestingly , mrk 3 resides in an s0 host galaxy ( de vaucouleurs et al . ,",
    "1991 ) , hence its relatively large [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratio of 1.62 may be in part due lack of dust in the galactic disk .    intermediate seyferts exhibit weak balmer lines either due to the inherent weakness of the blr emission , reddening of the blr , or a combination of these effects ( e.g. trippe et al . 2010 ) .",
    "if the extinction also affects the nlr , they might be expected to have [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios similar to seyfert 2s . in our sample , there is one clear outlier , ngc 3982 , with an [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] @xmath26 10.0 , which is likely affected by a strong contribution from star formation ( melndez et al .",
    "dropping ngc 3982 , the mean [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] for the intermediate seyferts is 1.24 , with a 95% confidence interval of 0.38  2.10 . a k - s test comparing this ratio for intermediate seyferts with that for seyfert 1s yields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , while comparing them with seyfert 2s yields @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "hence , based on the [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ratios , intermediate seyferts straddle the range of extinction among the seyfert 1s and 2s . while there are too few liners in our sample to perform a k - s test ,",
    "their mean [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] is 4.79 , which is consistent with their weak agn and lower - ionization nlrs .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , nagao et al . ( 2001 ) suggested that the lower values of r@xmath40 in seyfert 2s were due to the obscuration of high density / high emissivity gas in the inner nlr , which they characterized with @xmath41 @xmath17 .",
    "they further suggested that the differences in r@xmath40 s between seyfert 1s and 2s could be explained by a 520% contribution from this component in the former compared to a 05% contribution in the latter .",
    "similarly , in order to match the r@xmath13 observed in the bright , central emission - line knot in ngc 4151 , we ( crenshaw & kraemer 2005 ) generated a multi - component photoionization model , with the [ o  iii ] @xmath24363 emission dominated by gas with @xmath42 @xmath43 , at a distance of @xmath7 2 pc from the central source .    in figure 6 , we plot r@xmath13 against [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] ( given the small number of sources for which r@xmath13 s have been published",
    ", we included seyferts in inclined hosts ) .",
    "there is no apparent correlation , with a spearman rank coefficient of 0.14 and significance of deviation from zero of 0.39 .",
    "however , by over - plotting r@xmath13 for 20,000k in the low density limit ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) and the mean [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] for the seyfert 1s in our sample , one can see there are 4 distinct quadrants .",
    "most of the seyfert 1s lie in the upper two quadrants , indicating a contribution from dense gas to the r@xmath13 .",
    "there are 9 seyfert 1s in the upper left , with [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] below the the minimum value of the 95% confidence interval . for several of these",
    ", the weak [ o  iii ] could be due to reddening by an external dust that covers the nlr , as is likely the case for ngc 4235 , which is inclined , and , possibly , for ngc 6814 , mcg@xmath336@xmath3330@xmath3315 , and eso 140@xmath33g043 which have reddened continua ( morris & ward 1988 ) .",
    "on the other hand , most ( 12/19 ) of the seyfert 2s lie in the lower left quadrant .",
    "we interpret this as an indication that the extinction is greatest towards the inner nlr , which includes the dense [ o  iii]-emitting gas ( but , see discussion in section 5 . ) .",
    "note that there are a number of seyfert 2s that have [ o  iii]/[o  iv ] similar to the ( presumably ) reddened seyfert 1s , yet have lower r@xmath13 , which is consistent with dust surrounding the inner nlr in the former versus a more uniform external screen in the latter .",
    "there is some overlap between the two classes near the middle of the diagram , which could be a result of a relatively weak contribution from the dense component in some seyfert 1s and/or less extinction towards the inner nlr in some seyfert 2s , which , in turn , may be the an indication of patchy dust that allows a more direct view of the dense component .",
    "there are a few odd points in figure 6 .",
    "two seyfert 2s lie in the upper right quadrant : ngc 424 and ngc 1358 , the former has also been classified as an intermediate seyfert ( murayama , taniguchi , & iwasawa 1998 ) , hence it is not necessarily surprising that it has properties in common with seyfert 1s .",
    "although nagao et al.(2001 ) list an r@xmath13 for ngc 1358 based on emission line ratios from phillips , charles , & baldwin ( 1983 ) , neither ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1995 ) nor vaceli et al .",

    "the `` prototypical '' seyfert 1 galaxy , ngc 4151 , occupies the most extreme position in the lower right quadrant .",
    "there is evidence , however , that the extended nlr in ngc 4151 was ionized when the central source was significantly more luminous than at present ( e.g .. schulz & komossa 1993 ; wang et al .",

    "the question is how this gas is distributed and , specifically whether it is associated with the torus , ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "2001 ; baum et al . 2010 ) or dust structure at larger radial distances ( e.g , capetti et al . 1996",

    "2000 ) , the radial distance at which @xmath14 falls to 10@xmath55 @xmath17 , or an order of magnitude below the critical density for de - excitation of the @xmath18 level of o  iii ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) , is @xmath7 13 pc .",
    "hence , it is plausible that the dense o  iii - emitting component could be hidden if our view of ngc 4151 intersected the torus , as in seyfert 2s .",

    "however , de zotti & gaskell ( 1985 ) suggested that gas associated with the host galaxy is evacuated out to distances of @xmath12 100 pc , presumably due to the effect of radiation pressure and/or winds from the agn .",
    "as discussed in crenshaw & kraemer ( 2001 ) , such a scenario would lead to differences in reddening as a function of viewing angle towards the agn .",
