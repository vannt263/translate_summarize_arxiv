    "few - electron gate - defined quantum dots@xcite are exploited for single spin manipulation that allows for realization of single - qubit quantum gates.@xcite while the desired spin rotation involves a single spin as a carrier of quantum information , multielectron systems provide a feasible environment for readout of the controlled spin .",
    "strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling that is present in insb and inas nanowires @xcite allows for electrical spin rotations@xcite that are performed by electric dipole spin resonance ( edsr)@xcite which excludes the need for introduction of local magnetic field gradients@xcite or usage of hyperfine interaction.@xcite the readout of the spin is realized via spin to charge conversion that relies on the pauli spin blockade.@xcite the single electron current @xmath1 [ the numbers in the brackets correspond to the number of electrons in a particular dot ] is blocked at the transition from @xmath2 triplet to @xmath3 singlet .",
    "rotation of one of the spins of electrons constituting the @xmath2 triplet unblocks the current which serves as a proof for the coherent spin control . on the other hand",
    "strong so coupling leads to unavoidable spin relaxation which results in a spontaneous lifting of the pauli blockade when one of the @xmath2 triplets is close in energy to the @xmath3 singlet.@xcite    edsr lifting of the current blockade is observed already for two electrons bound in the double dot , which indeed is the case for many of the experiments.@xcite however some of the experimentally studied devices consist an even number @xmath4 of electrons greater than two.@xcite in this case the system is biased such the pauli blockade is between @xmath5 and @xmath6 states .",
    "it is assumed that such configuration is equivalent to the two - electron system.@xcite this approximation resembles the well established concept in chemistry , that the valence electrons are responsible for creation of bonds and the rest in the deep levels can be treated as the frozen core.@xcite this assumption seems questionable for quantum dots in which the single - electron shells are separated by much smaller energies than for the coulomb potential , nevertheless this problem has not been discussed by a theoretical study .",
    "the present work addresses this issue .",
    "we find that for a system with @xmath7 all but two electrons form closed singlet shells .",
    "this is in accordance with predictions of hubbard model,@xcite that appear as a consequence of mattis - lieb theorem,@xcite and which states that the lowest energy states posses the lowest spin ( s=0 ) . as a consequence , in general ,",
    "the low - energy spectra of multielectron double quantum dots in the @xmath5 configuration resemble the spectra of quantum dots in @xmath2 configuration and the states have similar total spins .",
    "we find that the @xmath5 spectra can be well recreated by a configuration interaction calculation in which one excludes the single - electron orbitals that form the singlet shells .",
    "this is analogous to the frozen core approximation regardless of the fact that there are no orbital shells in quantum - dots .",
    "the main finding of the work is that though a general resemblance of @xmath7 and @xmath8 spectra is found , the occupation of excited single - electron orbitals in the @xmath7 case leads to lifting of the degeneracy of spin - zero states .",
    "this in turn is translated to different effective @xmath0-factors in the dots .",
    "such differences have been observed in recent edsr experiments on nanowire quantum dots@xcite and have been related to the differences in the confinement as predicted by the study on self - organized quantum dots.@xcite here we strictly connect the effective @xmath0-factors with the number of electrons in the system and the length of the dots .",
