    "we must emphasize that corresponding calculations based on the local density approximation would completely fail to reproduce the doping behavior due to the lack of the insulating state of the parent compound latio@xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "the lda predicts a very large drude peak even for @xmath76 , which remains _ little changed _ as a function of doping . in view of these data ,",
    "the correct trend upon doping captured by the present calculation as well as proper frequency behavior can be considered as a significant improvement brought by this realistic dmft study .",

    "zero since we took @xmath87  larger than the optical gap of the insulator ) .",
    "upon doping , increase in @xmath90 is expected and its values as well as slope @xmath91 agree well with experiment .    the main effect introduced by the dmft  calculation on the strength of the optical transitions can be understood by looking at the drude and interband contributions separately and comparing them with the corresponding lda values .",
    "the lda data give a very large @xmath92 which by ninety per cent consists of the drude contribution .",
    "the latter can be found from the following equation : @xmath93 , where plasma frequency @xmath94  ev is obtained from lda calculations .",
    "this result is not surprising since in lda the @xmath71 states crossing the fermi level are filled with one electron which gives an estimation for the effective number of electrons participating in optical transitions at this frequency range .",
    "thus , due to proximity to the insulator the dmft suppresses ninety per cent of the drude part accounted for incorrectly by the metallic lda spectrum .",
    "now we discuss optical conductivity for the frequency interval from 0 to 16  ev .",
    "[ fig : opthigh ] shows @xmath81 at doping @xmath84 where we compare our dmft  and lda  calculations with the measurements in ref .  .",
    "sharp increase in optical conductivity is seen at @xmath95  ev .",
    "this can be attributed to the transitions from the oxygen @xmath96band into unoccupied @xmath25-states of ti .",
    "the main peak of optical transitions is located between 5 and 10  ev which is predicted by both dmftcalculation ( solid line ) and the lda ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is compared well with the measured spectrum ( dashed line with symbols ) .",
    "since the self  energy corrections modify only the states near the fermi level , we do not expect dmft spectrum to be essentially different from the lda one in this frequency range .",
    "overall , the agreement at high frequencies is quite good which demonstrates reliability of the present method .",
    "+    as an additional check of the dmft calculation , we have extracted the values of the linear specific heat coefficient @xmath97 as a function of doping .",

    "for example , at @xmath84 , experimental @xmath98 while dmft produces @xmath97 equal to 14  @xmath99 note that the lda value here is only about 4  @xmath100 .",
    "since dmft renormalizes the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath101 obtained by this theory clearly indicates the importance of band narrowing introduced by correlations .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how the optical properties of a realistic strongly correlated system can be computed using recently developed dmft based electronic structure method .",
    "we have developed a numerically tractable scheme which is reduced to evaluating dipole matrix elements as well as integrating in momentum and frequency spaces similar to the methods developed for non  interacting systems . as an application",
