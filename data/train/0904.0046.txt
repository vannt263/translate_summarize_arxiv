    "various thought experiments considering quantum gravitational fluctuations have shown that the classical concept of smooth spacetime in the general relativity is not appropriate in some extreme cases @xcite , and should be replaced in some way by a novel concept of quantum spacetime .",
    "fuzzy space is one of such candidates of quantum space @xcite .",
    "a fuzzy space is defined by an algebra of functions on it , unlike a classical spacetime being described by a coordinate system .",
    "this kind of algebraic definition of spaces has some physically interesting advantages over the classical description .",
    "for example , in quantum gravity , the changes of topologies and dimensions of space are believed to be the vital processes of quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , it is generally hard or tightly constrained to describe these processes without encountering singularities in the classical description @xcite . on the contrary , in general",
    ", one will have much more freedom to describe such processes in fuzzy spaces through interpolation between algebraic structures of fuzzy spaces approximating classical spaces with distinct topologies and/or dimensions .",
    "this kind of thoughts suggest an interesting research direction ; considering theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces as a model of quantum gravity .    in the recent years , there have been numerous discussions about gravity on fuzzy spaces .",
    "a class of approaches discuss analogues of the general relativity on fuzzy spaces . in this class of approaches , however , the dynamical variable is a fuzzy analogue of the metric tensor , and a fuzzy space itself is assumed to be fixed .",
    "therefore these approaches do not take the full advantages of the notion of fuzzy space as explained above . on the contrary ,",
    "a more interesting kind of approaches were initiated by the matrix models @xcite .",
    "these approaches consider spaces as dynamical objects generated as classical solutions or vacua , and fluctuations of matrices around such vacua are regarded as field fluctuations on background fuzzy spaces .",
    "then an extremely interesting possibility is that gravity may appear as one of these emergent fields .",
    "so far this is yet an open issue under active investigations @xcite .    in view of this present status",
    ", it might be meaningful to study another kind of model of dynamical fuzzy spaces , which is similar to but distinct from the matrix models .",
    "the model studied in this paper is the tensor model , which has a rank - three tensor as its dynamical variable , instead of matrices in the matrix models .",
    "the tensor model was originally proposed to describe the simplicial quantum gravity in dimensions greater than two @xcite .",
    "the tensor model has not yet been successful for the analysis of the simplicial quantum gravity itself , in part because of the absence of the analytical methods to solve the tensor model .",
    "however , it was recently proposed by the present author that the tensor model may be reinterpreted as theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that a fuzzy space can be characterized by a rank - three tensor @xmath0 which determines the algebraic relations among all the functions @xmath1 on a fuzzy space through the product @xmath2 . from this point of view",
    ", it may not be necessary to analytically solve the tensor model to make relations to physics .",
    "in analogy with the matrix model mentioned above , a classical solution in the tensor model may be regarded as a background fuzzy space , and the fluctuations of the tensor about it as field fluctuations .",
    "then the question is whether gravity appears in such fluctuations .",
    "in fact , in a class of tensor models which have the classical solutions with gaussian forms , it has been shown that the low - lying fluctuations about these solutions at low momenta match correctly with the metric fluctuations on flat spaces in the general relativity in general dimensions @xcite .",
    "the above agreement is very interesting , but it is merely classical and obviously not enough quantum mechanically .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show the agreement a step further to include the gauge degrees of freedom , which are the local translations in the present case .",
    "the tensor model has the symmetry of the orthogonal group @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of all the functions or more physically  points \" forming a fuzzy space .",
    "a background solution of the tensor model breaks this @xmath3 symmetry down to some remaining symmetries of the solution or the background space , and the broken symmetries are realized non - linearly around it .",
    "since the broken symmetries permute the  points \" of the background fuzzy space , they are intrinsically local symmetries , and it is tempting to insist that these are emergent local gauge symmetries ( the local translation symmetry ) . in this paper , to make this statement more precise and systematic , i will apply the brs gauge fixing procedure to the tensor model and numerically analyze the ghost kinetic term .",
    "then i will compare the results of the numerical analysis with the corresponding brs gauge fixing in the general relativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", i will apply the brs gauge fixing procedure to the tensor model . in sec.[sec : brsrelativity ] , i will discuss the corresponding brs gauge fixing procedure in the general relativity .",
    "in sec.[sec : numanaly ] , i will numerically study the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the ghost kinetic term in the tensor model at the gaussian backgrounds with dimensions @xmath5 , and compare with the ghost kinetic term in the general relativity on the flat spaces in these dimensions .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and discussions .",

    "there is also a _ nondynamical _ symmetric real tensor @xmath8 , which is basically taken to be @xmath9 .",
