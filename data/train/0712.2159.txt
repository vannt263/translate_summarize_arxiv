    "the study of star formation process and stellar evolution constitute one of the basic problems in astrophysics .",
    "since most of the stars tend to form in clusters or groups , star clusters are useful objects to study the star formation process .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) , defined as the distribution of stellar masses at the time of birth is one of the basic tools for understanding the formation and evolution of stellar systems .",
    "star forming regions ( sfrs ) and young star clusters have proven to be the ideal laboratories for studying the form of imf and its variation through space and time . since the young clusters ( age @xmath20 10 myr ) are assumed to be less affected by dynamical evolution , their mass function ( mf ) can be considered as the imf . however , a recent study by kroupa ( 2007 ) argues that even in the youngest clusters , it is difficult to trace the imf , as clusters evolve rapidly and therefore eject a fraction of their members even at a very young age .",
    "there are many unsolved issues concerning the universality of the stellar imf .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that the imf of a cluster should depend on the location , size , metallicity , density of the star forming environment and other conditions such as temperature or pressure ( zinnecker 1986 ; larson 1992 ; price @xmath21 podsiadlowski 1995 ) .",
    "but , convincing evidence for variation in the stellar imf has not yet been found observationally ( scalo 1998 ; kroupa 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) concluded that the slope of the imf at the higher mass range is universal , with a value of @xmath8= @xmath22 irrespective of the variations in metallicity .",
    "luhman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also found no systematic variations in imf of the nearby sfrs ( such as @xmath23 oph , ic 348 , trapezium ) although there is a large difference in stellar densities . on the other hand hillenbrand ( 1997 ) found a few sfrs with unusual imfs .",
    "the lack of strong evidence for imf variations suggests that its fundamental form may be universal .",
    "consequently , local conditions may not play any significant role in the star formation process . however , the influence of star formation history of young clusters on the form of imf is still an open issue .",
    "high - mass stars have strong influence on their surroundings and can significantly affect the formation of low mass stars .",
    "recently , a relatively large number of low mass stars have been detected in a few ob associations , e.g. upper scorpio , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 ori regions ( preibisch & zinnecker 1999 , dolan & mathieu 2002 ) . since this realization",
    ", surveys have demonstrated that the imfs must essentially be the same in all star forming regions .",
    "the apparent difference is due mainly to the inherent low percentage of high mass stars and the incomplete survey of low mass stars in high - mass star forming regions ( e.g. preibisch & zinneker 1999 , hillenbrand 1997 , massey et al .",
    "recently parker & goodwin ( 2007 ) have studied the origin of o - stars and their effect on low - mass star formation .",
    "advancement in detectors along with various surveys such as the 2mass , denis and available archived data from _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ space telescopes have permitted detailed studies of low - mass stellar population in regions of high mass star formation .    with the aim of understanding the star formation process and imf in and around young star cluster regions containing ob stars",
    ", we selected young cluster stock 8 located within the hii region of ic 417 ( sh2 - 234 ) in the auriga constellation of the perseus arm .",
    "no ccd photometric observations have been carried out for this region so far .",
    "mayer & macak ( 1971 ) have carried out photoelectric photometry of 11 bright stars in the region and reported a distance of 2.96 kpc for the cluster .",
    "using the photographic study of stars brighter than v = 16 mag , malysheva ( 1990 ) found cluster age as @xmath16 12 myr with an angular diameter of @xmath26 and a distance of 1.9 kpc .",
    "the present study is an attempt to understand the structure , star formation history , pre - main - sequence ( pms ) population and the form of imf of stock 8 using the @xmath0 ccd photometry data . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we describe the observations , data reductions and archived data used in the present work .",
    "sections 4 to 8 describe various results .",
    "the star formation scenario in the ic 417 ( sh2 - 234 ) region is described in sections 9 to 12 .",
    "the results are summarized in section 13 .",
    "the @xmath27 arcmin@xmath28 ( @xmath29 pc@xmath28 ) area containing the central region of stock 8 , reproduced from the dss2-r band image , is shown in fig .",
    "[ stock8 ] . as evident from the figure",
    ", stock 8 is embedded in an hii region . to the west of it , there are several ob stars which appear to form an ob association . to the east of stock 8 , we find a very peculiar chord - like nebulosity which we term as nebulous stream . a small cluster is also embedded within the nebulous stream .",
    "the small embedded cluster and the nebulous stream are discussed in sections 9 and 11 , respectively .",
    "we describe below the observations made to carry out a detailed study of the region .",
    "the ccd @xmath0 observations were carried out using the 2048 @xmath30 2048 pixel@xmath28 ccd camera on the 105-cm schmidt telescope of the kiso observatory , japan on november 4 , 2004 . at the schmidt focus ( f/3.1 )",
    "each pixel of 25 @xmath31 m corresponds to 1.5 arcsec and the entire chip covers a field of @xmath16 @xmath32 arcmin@xmath28 on the sky .",
    "the read - out noise and gain of the ccd are 23.2 @xmath33 and 3.4 @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the fwhm of the star images was @xmath16 3 arcsec . a number of bias and dome flat frames were also taken during the observing runs .",
    "we took short and long exposures in all the filters to avoid saturation of bright stars .",
    "sa 92 field of landolt ( 1992 ) was observed to standardize the field on the same night .",

    "this further supports the physical connection between the h ii region and the nebulous stream / cc 14 .",
    "we show the msx a , c , d and e - band contour maps of the stock 8 region in fig .",
    "the contours of the msx a and c - bands show an elliptical ridge around @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "the eastward contours seen in a ( 8 @xmath31 m ) and c ( 12 @xmath31 m ) bands lie beyond the ionization front and get diluted as we move towards d ( 15 @xmath31 m ) and e ( 21 @xmath31 m ) bands , whereas the emission towards the west remains present in all the four bands .",
    "the emission in the mir bands traces presence of warm small dust grains .",
    "the bands a and c also include several pah features as described in sec .",
    "the morphology of the emission shown in fig .",
    "[ msx ] suggests that the westward emission may be due to warm small dust grains , whereas eastward emission in a and c bands may be due to pahs because pahs can not survive in ionized regions as the hard radiation field within hii regions destroys them ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ hires ] we show iras - hires intensity maps for the cluster region at @xmath40 m , @xmath41 m , @xmath42 m and @xmath43 m .",

    "the peaks of fir and mir emissions are @xmath16 2@xmath52 away from the peak of the radio continuum emission , which indicates an interaction between the gas and dust around the region .",
    "iras - hires maps at 60 and @xmath43 m were also used to generate the spatial distribution of dust colour temperature ( t(60/100 ) ) and optical depth maps at 100 @xmath31 m ( @xmath53 ) using the procedure given by ghosh et al .",
    "an emissivity law of @xmath54 was assumed to generate the optical depth map .",
    "[ tau_temp ] presents the contour maps of dust colour temperature ( @xmath55 ) and optical depth ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the dust colour temperature varies from 34 to 48 @xmath14 as can be inferred from the map shown in fig .",
    "[ tau_temp ] .",
    "the relatively high temperature around the cluster may probably be due to the radiation from massive star(s ) in the region .",
    "the @xmath53 map represents low optical depth around the position of stock 8 , whereas its peak matches well with the co peak and the position of cc 14 .",
    "what is the nature of the nebulous stream ? at first impression it appears like a giant herbig - haro jet and reminds us of hh 399 in trifid nebula ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "however this does not seem to be the case .",
    "[ kimage ] reveals that it is closely associated with the distribution of the msx a - band emission , as well as the distribution of h@xmath5 emission stars and ir - excess stars .",
    "the cluster cc 14 is also embedded within the nebulous stream .",
    "we therefore interpret the nebulous stream as a bright rim or an ionization front .",
    "[ has2 ] shows continuum - subtracted h@xmath5 and [ s ii ] images for the region along with contours for msx a - band emission and radio continuum superimposed on the [ s ii ] image .",
    "the gap seen at the middle of fig .",
    "[ has2 ] is because the field was observed in two frames without an overlap .",
    "the h@xmath5 emission is more extended compared to the [ s ii ] emission .",
    "the [ s ii ] emission comes from low - excitation zones and is enhanced close to the ionization fronts ( cf .",
    "deharveng et al .",
    "therefore the spatial distribution of the [ s ii]/h@xmath5 ratio should give information on the excitation conditions .",
    "the variation of the [ s ii]/h@xmath5 ratio along a @xmath56.5 wide strip ( indicated by black dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ has2 ] ) as a function of radial distance from stock 8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ s2overha_dust ] . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and to remove faint stars , the images were median filtered using a 3 @xmath57 3 pixel box .",
    "a background was then determined for these smoothed images by calculating the statistics inside a 3@xmath303 pixel box at various places where the h@xmath5 and [ s ii ] brightness is at a minimum . the average background value was then subtracted from each pixel . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ s2overha_dust ] the ratio of [ s ii]/h@xmath5 is higher eastwards of the cluster stock 8 . note that the values in the eastern most region are not reliable because the error bars are very large .",
    "mean value of the [ s ii]/h@xmath5 ratio for the central region @xmath58 of stock 8 is @xmath16 0.18@xmath590.06 , which is consistent with the ratio expected for an h ii region associated with a late o - b0 type star ( reynolds 1988 ) .",
    "whereas in the region between @xmath60 and 12 @xmath52 the mean value of the ratio is higher , @xmath16 0.24@xmath61 .",
    "this indicates that the nebulous stream is a low - excitation object suggestive of its bright - rim/ ionization front nature .",
    "the question then arises ; where is(are ) the source(s ) of its excitation ?",
    "the o9.5/ b0 stars of stock 8 or o8/ o9 stars further west do not seem to be the possible source because the morphology of the radio and msx a - band emissions indicates an interface at @xmath36 @xmath62 and suggests that the ionization front has not reached the nebulous stream .",
    "uv radiation from the west of the stream is most probably blocked by the molecular gas located at the interface at @xmath36 @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the stream runs in the east - west direction , which suggests that the uv photons responsible for the stream should arrive from the north . in a search towards the north of the stream",
    ", we find an o8 star ( star number 13 at @xmath63 @xmath64 , distance @xmath16 2.06 kpc : cruz - gonzalez et al .",
    "1974 ; 2.7 kpc : savage , 1985 ) located at a projected distance of 9 pc from the nebulous stream .",
    "we suspect that this star could be the possible source of uv photons which excite the stream .    in order to verify whether this star emits enough uv photons to generate the bright rim",
    ", we calculated the flux of lyman continuum photons which are expected to arrive at the location of the bright rim .",
    "the flux associated with an o8 star is taken from panagia ( 1973 ) .",
    "we assumed in our calculations , that loss of photons due to absorption by interstellar matter between the star and bright rim is negligible . using a projected distance of @xmath16 9 pc between the star and the bright rim , the lyman photon flux at the bright rim",
    "is estimated to be @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "the lyman photon flux reaching a radial distance of @xmath68 3.6 pc ) from b0 star is @xmath69",
    "@xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "the estimated flux of @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 in the case of o8 star is comparable to the ionizing flux associated with the bright rimmed clouds ( see thompson et al .",
    "2004 , morgan et al .",
    "2004 ) which supports an o8 star as responsible for the nebulous stream .",
    "the energetic stellar uv radiation and winds from massive stars could disperse nearby clouds and consequently terminate further star formation .",
    "alternatively , they can enhance star formation activity in the region .",
    "elmegreen & lada ( 1977 ) proposed that after formation of massive stars , the expanding ionization fronts play a constructive role in inducing a sequence of star - formation activities in the neighbourhood .",
    "the distribution of visible young stars and embedded ysos and the morphological details of the environment around the cluster containing ob stars can be used to probe the star formation history of the region .",
    "in addition to the @xmath70co contours and the locations of ob stars , fig .",
    "[ comap ] also shows spatial distribution of nir - excess sources and h@xmath5 emission stars . in fig .",
    "[ nirexc ] we plot nir excess , @xmath71 , for three sub - regions ( regions i , ii and iii ) shown in fig .",
    "[ comap ] as a function of radial distance from the center of the cluster stock 8 .",
    "[ nirexc ] indicates that the stars lying in regions i and iii show relatively higher nir excess .",
    "this trend in nir excess may be an indication of the youth of ysos located in regions i and iii as compared to those located near the center of stock 8 . to verify further the age sequence , we plot @xmath72 and @xmath73 cmds for the three sub - regions in fig .",
    "[ cmd_sel ] , which also suggests that the ysos in regions i and iii are relatively younger than those located near the cluster center .",
    "as mentioned earlier , several ob stars are located around the cluster stock 8 .",
    "we suspect that these sources belong to the first generation of stars formed in the ic 417 region , although the evidence is rather weak because of their scattered distribution .",
    "the age of the early - type stars in stock 8 is estimated to be @xmath6 2 myr , whereas the ysos in the stock 8 region indicate an average age of @xmath16 3 myr ( see figs .",
    "[ excess ] and [ cmd_sel ] ) .",
    "however these two age estimates probe different physical mechanisms , viz . , the former being a nuclear age and the latter a contraction age .",
    "so , we conclude that they are practically in agreement .",
    "we suspect that the formation of stars in stock 8 region was triggered by the first - generation stars mentioned above .",
    "the uv radiation from the ob stars , in particular the o8/o9 stars ( star numbers 2 and 3 of table 3 ) , seem to have swept the pre - existing molecular cloud towards east of these stars .",
    "it formed a compressed gas layer which became unstable against self - gravity and collapsed to form second generation stars in the form of stock 8 and surrounding ysos in the region ii .",
    "the shock / ionization front seems to be moving further to the east into the low density gas and accumulating a denser layer of molecular gas , which we now observe as a hole in the msx a - band emission region .",
    "the younger age of the ysos scattered in region iii is very strange .",
    "we suspect that they recently formed in scattered remnant clouds as seen in the orion region ( ogura & sugitani 1998 ) .",
    "a hint of the presence of such remnant clouds is noticed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ comap ] . in this sense",
    "they may well be considered as stars of the third generation in the stock 8 region .",
    "the narrow strip along the nebulous stream appears to be another active region ( region i ) of recent star formation . fig .",
    "[ comap ] shows that a few nir - excess sources ( 11 stars ) and h@xmath5 stars ( 13 stars ) are distributed along the nebulous stream which also contains the cc 14 cluster .",
    "the peaks of @xmath70co and msx a - band @xmath53 contours along the nebulous stream almost coincide with the location of the embedded cluster . as we have discussed above",
    ", these stars show an average age of @xmath16 1 myr .",
    "the question is whether the star formation here has been triggered by the uv radiation from the o / b star in stock 8 or from the o stars located further west .",
    "this is unlikely , because , as we have discussed in sec .",
    "10 , the action of the uv radiation from these stars does not seem to reach this region .",
    "the morphology of the nebulous stream as well as the slightly - displaced distribution of the ysos and cc 14 to the south with respect to the stream suggest that the pre - existing molecular gas might have been compressed by the shock front associated with the ionization front caused by the o8 star located northwards of the stream ( cf",
    ". section 11 ) .",
    "so , the star formation activity along the nebulous stream is probably independent of that in the stock 8 region .",
    "on the basis of a comprehensive multi - wavelength study of the ic 417 ( sh2 - 234 ) region we have made an attempt to determine the basic properties of the cluster stock 8 as well as to study the star formation scenario in the region .",
    "deep optical @xmath0 and narrow - band [ s ii ] , h@xmath5 photometric data , slitless spectroscopy along with archival data from the surveys such as 2mass , msx , iras and nvss are used to understand the star formation in and around the cluster stock 8 .",
    "reddening ( @xmath74 ) in the direction of the cluster is found to be varying between 0.40 to 0.60 mag .",
    "the post - main - sequence age and distance of the cluster are found to be @xmath75 myr and 2.05 @xmath76 kpc respectively . using 2mass nir two - colour diagram and grism survey for h@xmath5 emission stars , we identified candidate ysos . a significant number of ysos ( 22 stars )",
    "are aligned along a nebulous stream eastwards of the cluster and an embedded cluster is located along the stream at a distance of @xmath1613 arcmin ( 7.8 pc ) from the center of stock 8 .",
    "the mass of the ysos lie in the range of @xmath16 0.1 - 3.0 @xmath77 .",
    "the position of ysos on the cmds indicates that the majority of these stars in cluster stock 8 have ages @xmath16 1 to 5 myr indicating star formation in the cluster may be non - coeval .    the embedded cluster in the nebulous stream",
    "is found to be physically connected to the h ii region .",
    "the ysos located in the nebulous stream , embedded cluster and in the western region of stock 8 have larger @xmath78 excess in comparison to those located in the central region of stock 8 .",
    "the @xmath78 excess , @xmath79 and @xmath80 cmds indicate that these ysos are younger than those located in the central region of stock 8 .",
    "the radio continuum , msx , iras maps and the ratio of [ s ii]/h@xmath5 intensities indicate that the eastern region of the cluster is ionization bounded , whereas , the western region of the stock 8 is density bounded .",
    "the morphology of radio emission and msx a - band emission suggests that ionization/ shock front caused by the central ionization source of stock 8 and by o type stars located in the western region of stock 8 , has not reached the nebulous stream .",
    "an o8 star located @xmath16 9 pc away towards the north of the nebulous stream may be a probable source of the bright - rimmed nebulous stream .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 ccd photometry of the young open cluster stock 8 with the aim of studying its basic properties such as the amount of interstellar extinction , distance , age , stellar contents and initial mass function ( imf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the star formation scenario in this region . from optical data , </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the cluster is found to be @xmath1 ( @xmath2 pc ) and the reddening within the cluster region varies from @xmath3 to 0.60 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster is located at a distance of @xmath4 kpc . using h@xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> slitless spectroscopy and 2mass nir data we identified h@xmath5 emission and nir excess young stellar objects ( ysos ) , respectively . from their locations in the colour - magnitude diagrams , majority of them seem to have ages between 1 to 5 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the spread in their ages indicate a possible non - coeval star formation in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> massive stars in the cluster region reveal an average age of @xmath6 2 myr . in the cluster region ( @xmath7 ) the slope of the mass function ( mf ) , @xmath8 , in the mass range @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> can be represented by a power law having a slope of @xmath10 , which agrees well with salpeter value ( -1.35 ) . in the mass range @xmath11 , the mf </S>",
    "<S> is also found to follow a power law with a shallower slope of @xmath12 indicating a break in the slope of the imf at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the @xmath14-band luminosity function for the cluster ( @xmath7 ) is found to be @xmath15 , which is smaller than the average value ( @xmath16 0.4 ) obtained for embedded star clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> a significant number of ysos are distributed along a nebulous stream towards the east side of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a small cluster is embedded in the nebulous stream . </S>",
    "<S> the ysos lying in the nebulous stream and in the embedded cluster are found to be younger than the stars in the cluster stock 8 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio continuum , msx , iras mid- and far - infrared maps and the ratio of [ s ii]/h@xmath5 intensities indicate that the eastern region of stock 8 is ionization bounded whereas the western region is density bounded . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology seems to indicate that the ionization/ shock front caused by the ionizing sources located in the stock 8 region and westwards of stock 8 has not reached the nebulous stream . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that star formation activity in the nebulous stream and embedded cluster may be independent from that of stock 8 .    </S>",
