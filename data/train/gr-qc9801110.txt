    "numerical relativity comprises the dynamical solution of the einstein equations on a computer , allowing the construction of spacetimes that can not be studied by purely analytic methods .",
    "a major application of numerical relativity is the modeling of astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation such as binary black hole @xcite or neutron star inspiral @xcite , and nonspherical stellar collapse @xcite .",
    "the continued development of gravitational wave detectors , with the expectation that ground - based interferometers such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite and geo600 @xcite will begin taking data in a few years , gives these studies a high priority .",
    "numerical relativity is also important for studying the dynamics of pure gravitational waves @xcite , inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite , the behavior of cosmological singularities @xcite , and critical behavior in general relativity @xcite .",
    "all of these endeavors require accurate numerical algorithms to correctly model the physics of curved spacetime .",
    "simulations in three spatial dimensions plus time are expensive in terms of both cpu usage and memory requirements , and thus demand numerical methods that are efficient in both these regards .",
    "memory limits , however , are less elastic in the short term than cpu time constraints",
    ". thus a three - level second order algorithm may be more appropriate than a faster , high order algorithm which can only be implemented on smaller problems .",
    "also , modeling the inspiral of binary black holes or neutron stars requires evolving the system for many orbital periods , so that numerical algorithms with long term stability and freedom from unphysical damping are essential .",
    "leapfrog methods are often used for the time integration of equations in numerical relativity and other branches of computational physics .",
    "the 3-level leapfrog method has the important property of being symplectic . in the context of a hamiltonian system for which the differential equation has a symplectic structure ( conjugate pairing of coordinates and momenta )",
    ", this means that the difference equations also have such a structure and the integration step in the difference equations is a canonical transformation . with a symplectic integrator , all the lagrangian integral invariants ,",
    "including phase space volume , are exactly conserved by the integration scheme . since the leapfrog method is time symmetric and maintains good conservation of physically conserved quantities @xcite , it has a well - deserved reputation in the context of newtonian mechanics .",
    "unfortunately this reputation is generally not merited when velocity dependent forces are met . in the integration of systems with such forces , this scheme is well - known to be susceptible to numerical instability ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , even under conditions where local linearization analysis anticipates stability .",
    "this instability occurs in the integration of both ordinary and partial differential equations and , in the case of partial differential equations , is independent of the mesh size used for the spatial discretization @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the origin of this instability was given by sanz - serna @xcite who pointed out that the leapfrog scheme approximates not merely the intended differential equation system but a larger `` augmented '' system containing additional , nonphysical , parasitic modes .",
    "since the leapfrog method is symplectic as applied to the augmented system @xcite , the advantages of symplectic methods ( see @xcite ) would be attained to the extent that the parasitic modes remain zero numerically , as they do in an exact solution of the augmented system @xcite .",
    "aoyagi and abe @xcite identified the diagnostic symptom of this instability as a sawtooth oscillation or alternation of values between odd and even steps of the integration , and supplied a cure  a runge - kutta smoother to suppress this oscillation .",
    "subsequent work @xcite shows these phenomena in ordinary differential equations , where the delayed onset of this instability is clearly apparent .",
    "we have studied the use of the 3-level leapfrog method in numerical relativity . in this work ( see also @xcite ) , we extend the ideas of aoyagi and collaborators for removing the unstable parasitic modes , yielding an algorithm that reduces the number of time levels of data that must be stored by the code , allows the timestep to be changed , and thus is better suited to long - term integration of large scale numerical systems .",
    "although we concentrate on the adm 3 + 1 formalism for numerical relativity , our methods are quite general and thereby applicable to a wide range of problems in computational physics . section  [ instability ] describes the source of the 3-level leapfrog instability .",

    "the 3-level leapfrog discretization of this system is @xmath3 where we assume a constant timestep @xmath4 between time levels @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the distinction between @xmath7 in the differential equation and @xmath8 in the difference equation is a warning that the relationship is not as straighforward as first appears .",

    "( [ discrete - newt ] ) ] can become unstable . as we shall explain below",
    ", nonphysical parasitic modes can arise during the time integration and eventually destroy the numerical solution .",

    "it also requires the specification of initial data at two time levels , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which is twice as much as the original first - order differential equation system requires .",
    "this doubling of initial condition specifications is the clue to the fact that this numerical algorithm using @xmath8 has twice as many degrees of freedom as does the physical system where states are specified by @xmath7 .",

    "( [ augmented ] ) , the 3-level leapfrog integrator alone can not distinguish between them and the physical solutions .    since the physical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ augmented - ode ] ) have @xmath35 it is natural to define @xmath36 so that the @xmath37 measure the parasitic deviations from the desired physical solutions @xmath38 .",
    "one can rewrite eqs .",

    "( [ augmented ] ) , as @xmath39 the solution @xmath40 to the leapfrog difference system [ eqs .",
    "( [ discrete - ode ] ) ] thus contains both physical @xmath41 and parasitic modes @xmath42 . with this notation ,",
    "the augmented differential equations can be written as @xcite @xmath43 we note that when these are expanded in powers of @xmath44 one has @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the matrix of partial derivatives @xmath47 .    the second of eqs .",
    "( [ parametric - ode ] ) , ignoring the cubic and higher terms , is a linear equation ( in @xmath44 ) which from the time dependence in @xmath48 easily gives rise to parametric amplification @xcite leading to growth of the parasitic modes @xmath44 .",
    "such parametric amplification was clearly diagnosed in a useful example @xcite . a still stronger argument for the growth of parasitic modes ( without the above linear perturbation assumptions )",
    "had been given earlier by sanz - serna @xcite based on his proof that the leapfrog scheme preserves volume in the augmented state space even when the original system is not hamiltonian .",
    "sanz - serna has an elementary example , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with a two dimensional @xmath51 augmented phase space ( fig .  1 in @xcite ) ; this shows all the qualitative features of the delayed onset instability typical of numerical catastrophies that generally result from using leapfrog in nonlinear systems with velocity dependent forces . in this example , _ every _ solution diverges ( @xmath52 ) if at any point @xmath53 , although @xmath54 as @xmath55 for the physical @xmath56 solution .",
    "numerical experiments with leapfrog follow the divergent solutions of this analytical example since @xmath53 at some point arises either from imperfect initial conditions , roundoff error , or discretization error .",
    "hence , nonlinear interaction or parametric amplification of linear interaction between the physical and parasitic modes of the solution to the leapfrog difference system [ eqs .",
    "( [ discrete - ode ] ) ] can cause the parasitic mode to grow to the point where it destroys the numerical solution .    however , if the augmented difference system [ eqs .",
    "( [ discrete - ode ] ) or ( [ augmented ] ) ] decouples , no such instability occurs . to illustrate what it means for these equations to decouple ,",
    "consider the augmented difference system for eqs .",
    "( [ discrete - newt ] ) , in the absence of velocity dependent forces .",
    "in that case one can let @xmath57 and @xmath58 to find that the ( even @xmath17 , odd @xmath59 ) system does not couple to the ( odd @xmath60 , even @xmath61 ) system .",
    "thus the augmented difference system consists of two interlaced , noninteracting copies ( even @xmath17 , odd @xmath59 ) and ( odd @xmath60 , even @xmath62 ) of the physical system .",
    "each of these two systems is of the newtonian form where the leapfrog scheme has shown itself remarkably stable .",
    "thus , as mentioned above , in a 3-level leapfrog integration of eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) stablity can generally only be anticipated in the absence of velocity dependent forces . in this case , the parasitic mode is generally still present as the difference between two interlaced numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) , but will remain small unless the physical system is highly sensitive to small differences in initial conditions ( i.e. , chaotic ) . note that it is customary , in the absence of velocity dependent forces , to omit the @xmath60 and @xmath61 variables from the integration scheme , yielding the staggered leapfrog scheme ( see below ) .",
    "alternatively , in a code based on eqs .",
    "( [ discrete - ode ] ) , one could in this case solve for two independent solutions approximating eqs .",
    "( [ ode ] ) based on distinct initial conditions for @xmath63 and for @xmath64 .    a stable 3-level leapfrog integration of a system of equations containing `` velocity dependent forces '' can be maintained if the growth of the parasitic mode can be controlled .",

    "( [ constraint - ode ] ) they reduce to the original physical system of eq .",
    "( [ ode ] ) .",
    "this constraint , when imposed initially , is preserved by the differential equation system ( [ constraint - ode ] ) since @xmath66 gives @xmath67 .",
    "but in numerical implementations errors will inevitably introduce nonzero @xmath37 .",
    "the cure proposed by aoyagi and abe @xcite is to reimpose the constraint @xmath68 as necessary to suppress the parasitic mode .",
    "their method for doing so is based on the identification of @xmath44 via its signature even - odd timepstep alternation in sign , which is evident in eq .",
    "( [ z - x - y ] ) .",
    "as noted in @xcite , this method is very efficient since , from the power series expansions in eqs .",
    "( [ parametric - ode ] ) , the parasitic modes @xmath44 need merely be suppressed to single precision accuracy to assure that they do not contaminate the physical solution @xmath7 in double precision .",
    "we will return to the cure in sec .",
    "[ deloused ] below .",
    "note that the instability under discussion here is not related to the `` mesh - drifting '' instability inherent to non - dissipative leapfrog integrations of partial differential equations @xcite . as has been emphasized above",
    ", the 3-level leapfrog instability can arise in integrations of both ordinary and partial differential equations and results from the temporal , not spatial , discretization of the method .    to demonstrate this instability , we have used the 3-level leapfrog method to numerically integrate the geodesic equations for a particle moving on a circular orbit of radius @xmath69 in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "in the limit @xmath70 , we recover the usual newtonian equations of motion [ eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) ] . in this case , the leapfrog method produced a circular orbit that was stable for ten thousand orbital periods ( before we terminated the run ) .",
    "however , as @xmath69 is decreased , general relativistic effects give rise to terms that behave like velocity - dependent forces and the integrator fails to maintain a stable evolution .",
    "[ unstable - orbit ] shows the results of the geodesic integration for the case @xmath71 . the particle orbit shown in fig .",
    "[ unstable - orbit]a initially appears to be stable ; eventually the instability manifests as the solutions on the even and odd timesteps diverge .",
    "[ unstable - orbit]b shows the magnitude of the particle s position vector as a function of time ; again the even and odd solutions clearly diverge as the parasitic mode grows to destructive levels .",
    "although the parasitic mode is present from the beginning of the calculation , it takes a number of orbits before it grows to noticeable levels ; the instability then grows catastrophically , causing the integration to crash after about six orbits .",
    "two other integration methods ( whose efficiency we will compare with that of our deloused leapfrog algorithm in sec .  [ sims ] ) , staggered leapfrog and crank - nicholson , do not suffer from the instability present in the 3-level leapfrog algorithm . in both cases",
    "this happens because neither of these algorithms augments the phase space ( or state space ) of the problem by adding new degrees of freedom not found in the physical system . to illustrate this",
    ", we will continue to use the integration of eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) as the example upon which we base our outline of these integration algorithms .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the even and odd degrees of freedom in eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) can be written @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "but when the force law lets @xmath72 be calculated independently of @xmath59 , the @xmath73 pair of variables are not coupled to the @xmath74 pair , so this second pair can be dropped from the numerical algorithm .",
    "this leads to the methodology of the staggered leapfrog algorithm , which defines the variables it evolves on alternating time levels only . a staggered leapfrog integration of eqs .",
    "( [ newt ] ) would , for example , evaluate only @xmath17 at even steps and only @xmath59 at odd steps .",
    "it is then customary to renumber the steps so that the even steps are integer values , the odd half integer : @xmath75 where the constant @xmath4 is the difference between two consecutive integer ( or half - integer ) time levels @xcite .",

    "when @xmath77 depends on @xmath59 as well as @xmath17 , a method such as extrapolation ( e.g. , @xmath78 ) is needed to calculate @xmath59 at the integer ( or even ) levels ; this generally destroys the time - symmetric nature of the algorithm and leads to errors in conserved quantities .",
    "the crank - nicholson technique is an iterative integration algorithm @xcite .",
    "for the system given in eqs .",

    "( [ cn1 ] ) .",
    "the steps given by eqs .",
    "( [ cn1 ] ) and ( [ cn2 ] ) are then repeated until the relative differences of the values of each of the components of @xmath83 and @xmath84 between adjacent iteration cycles have each converged to the desired level of accuracy .",
    "this method requires the specification of initial data @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it has accuracy @xmath87 ; it is time symmetric if the iteration converges to machine precision .",
    "both the staggered leapfrog and the crank - nicholson algorithms avoid the instability arising from an augmented phase space .",
    "one sees in each case that there is a single physical pair of values at each timestep .",
    "these are @xmath88 for staggered leapfrog and @xmath89 for crank - nicholson .",
    "other quantities such as @xmath84 in staggered leapfrog or the half integer values in crank - nicholson are temporary variables computed from the physical data .",
    "thus no extraneous degrees of freedom , like the @xmath37 quantities in 3-level leapfrog , appear .",
    "the instability in the 3-level leapfrog scheme is ideally eliminated with a technique that retains as much of the symplectic character of the 3-level scheme as possible .",
    "aoyagi and abe @xcite give such a prescription to remove the parasitic modes before they grow large enough to destroy the calculation .",

    "they compare it to a less effective second order smoother suggested by a colleague .",
    "we have extended the work of aoyagi and abe to produce a second order algorithm which requires less storage and also allows the use of adaptive ( i.e. , not constant in time ) timesteps @xmath4 ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite discusses its properties in hamiltonian problems with applications to highly noncircular and highly relativistic geodesics .",
    "those applications use the adaptive timestep our delousing routine allows .",
    "the prescription for a delousing step to remove the parasitic modes uses a second order runga - kutta ( rk2 ) algorithm .",

    "our algorithm proceeds as follows .",

    "( [ discrete - newt ] ) , we assume that data is available on ( say ) an odd level @xmath5 and an even level @xmath90 .",
    "first , use rk2 to evolve the data a half - step backward from the odd level @xmath5 and a half - step forward from the even level @xmath90 :    step ( 1 ) : :    use rk2 with @xmath91 +    to get @xmath92    from @xmath93 step ( 2 ) : :    use rk2 with @xmath94 +    to get @xmath95    from @xmath96 ,    where , for example , @xmath97 represents data on level that comes from the odd level @xmath5 .",
    "we now have data from both odd and even solutions at the same time level .",
    "( [ parasitic - def ] ) are then utilized to obtain the data @xmath98 and @xmath99 that contain only the physical mode :    step ( 3 ) : :    set @xmath100 , +    @xmath101 .    with the parasitic mode thus eliminated at level @xmath102 ( i.e. , with the constraint @xmath103 enforced ) , we now use rk2 to step the data a half - step forward and backward :    step ( 4 ) : :    use rk2 with @xmath104 +    to get @xmath105 from    @xmath106 step ( 5 ) : :    use rk2 with @xmath107 +    to get @xmath96 from    @xmath106 .",
    "since rk2 does not suffer from the leapfrog instability ( for the same reason as that given in the preceeding section for the stability of the staggered leapfrog and crank - nicholson methods ) , no parasitic mode is introduced by its use . with",
    "this `` deloused '' data at levels @xmath5 and @xmath90 , which contain only the physical modes , the 3-level leapfrog integration is resumed .",
    "this prescription can be coded so that no more than three levels of data for @xmath17 and @xmath59 need be kept in memory at any one time , which is an important consideration when it is applied to @xmath0 dimensional partial differential equations .",

    "we modified this code to allow the use of the deloused leapfrog scheme . because the staggered leapfrog method has not been implemented in the adm code , the efficiencies of only the crank - nicholson and deloused leapfrog integrators were evaluated in this case .",
    "the deloused leapfrog integrations of this spacetime were five to eight times more cost effective than the crank - nicholson runs ( see fig .  [ eff - polarizedgowdy ] ) .",
    "thus , the results of our testbed simulations indicate that the deloused leapfrog algorithm is an effective and efficient cure for the 3-level leapfrog instability . further evaluation of this algorithm , via its use in more complex problems in numerical relativity , such as a contracting gowdy universe containing unpolarized gravitational waves , and other fields , would serve to confirm the robustness of the method and provide insight into its cost effectiveness in different numerical scenarios .",
    "one aspect of the deloused leapfrog algorithm that has the potential to alter the conclusions of such efficiency analyses is the choice of delousing trigger . based on our experience , we suspect that choice of a trigger which initiates an _ excessive _ number of delousing steps will degrade the accuracy of a simulation to some degree .",
    "if this is the case , a decrease in the average interval between delousing steps would not only increase the cost of the run , but would also decrease its numerical accuracy somewhat . on the other hand , an increase in the delousing interval would allow the parasitic mode in the numerical solution to grow to higher levels .",
    "for example , had a change in the sign of the temporal slope of @xmath196 been used as the delousing trigger in the deloused leapfrog simulation of the polarized gowdy spacetime , the parasitic mode would likely have grown to a greater extent between delousing intervals , as its presence became sizeable in @xmath196 rather late in the evolution ( see figs .",
    "[ gowdy - unstable1 ] and [ gowdy - unstable2 ] ) .",
    "thus the choice of delousing trigger may involve a trade - off between the loss of some degree of accuracy introduced into the computation via the delousing steps and the degree to which the parasitic mode is permitted to grow between these steps .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the deloused leapfrog algorithm permits the stable numerical evolution of simple vacuum spacetimes .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that deloused leapfrog may be a better integration technique than crank - nicholson to employ in complex numerical relativity simulations , as this new algorithm was more cost effective than the crank - nicholson method in our simulation of a spatially varying spacetime .",
