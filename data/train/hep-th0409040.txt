    "the ads / cft correspondence is a strong - weak coupling duality .",
    "weakly coupled yang - mills is mapped to the string theory on the highly curved ads space .",
    "when ads space is highly curved , the string worldsheet theory becomes strongly coupled .",
    "therefore , the weakly coupled yang - mills maps to the strongly coupled string worldsheet theory . nevertheless , in some situations elements of the ym perturbation theory can be reproduced from the string theory side .",
    "one of the examples are the `` spinning strings '' .",
    "spinning strings are a class of solutions of the classical string worldsheet theory .",
    "they were first considered in the context of the ads / cft correspondence in @xcite .",
    "these are strings rotating in @xmath1 with a large angular momentum .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that the energy of these solutions has an expansion in some small parameter which is similar in form to the perturbative expansion in the field theory on the boundary",
    ". then @xcite computed the anomalous dimensions of single trace operators with the generic large r - charge , making the actual comparison possible . in @xcite",
    "more general solutions were considered , having large compact charges both in @xmath1 and in @xmath2 .",
    "for all these solutions , computations in the classical worldsheet theory lead to the series in the small parameter which on the field theory side is identified with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thooft coupling constant and @xmath5 a large conserved charge .",
    "moreover it was shown in @xcite that the quantum corrections to the classical worldsheet theory are suppressed for the solutions with the large conserved charge ( see also the recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this opened the possibility that the results of the calculations in the classical mechanics of spinning strings , which are valid a priori only in the large @xmath4 limit , can be in fact extended to weak coupling and therefore compared to the yang - mills perturbation theory .",
    "it was conjectured that the yang - mills perturbation theory in the corresponding sector is reproduced by the classical dynamics of the spinning strings .",
    "the following picture is emerging .",
    "single string states in @xmath6 correspond to single - trace operators in the @xmath7 supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "( we consider the large @xmath8 limit . )",
    "the dynamics of the single - trace operators is described in the perturbation theory by an integrable spin chain .",
    "this spin chain has a classical continuous limit @xcite which describes a class of operators with the large r - charges . in this limit",
    "the spin chain becomes a classical continuous system .",
    "we have conjectured in @xcite that this classical system is equivalent to the worldsheet theory of the classical string in @xmath6 .",
    "the yang - mills perturbative expansion corresponds to considering the worldsheet of the fast moving string as a perturbation of the null - surface @xcite .",
    "the null - surface perturbation theory was previously considered in a closely related context in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will try to make the statement of equivalence more precise .",
    "we will argue that the string worldsheet theory has a `` hidden '' @xmath9 symmetry which is defined unambiguously by its characteristic properties which we describe .",
    "this @xmath9 commutes with the group of geometrical symmetries of the target space .",
    "it corresponds to the _ length of the spin chain _ on the field theory side .",
    "we conjecture that the phase space of the classical continuous spin chain is equivalent to the hamiltonian reduction of the phase space of the classical string by the action of this @xmath9 .",
    "the equivalence commutes with the action of geometrical symmetries .",
    "we should stress that the hidden @xmath9 symmetry which we discuss in this paper was constructed already in @xcite , but the explicit calculation was carried out only at the first nontrivial order of the null - surface perturbation theory .",
    "the main new result of our paper is that we discuss this hidden symmetry from the point of view of the integrability .",
    "we conjecture the relation between the @xmath9 symmetry and the local conserved charges which if true gives a uniform description of this symmetry at all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the classical string on @xmath6 is an integrable system ( see @xcite and references there ) , and our @xmath9 corresponds to an action variable .",
    "the existence of the action variables for integrable systems with a finite - dimensional phase space is a consequence of the liouville theorem @xcite .",
    "the classical string has an infinite - dimensional phase space .",
    "we are not aware of the existence of a general theorem which would guarantee that the action variables can be constructed in the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "but we will give two arguments for the existence of one action variable for the string in @xmath6 , at least in the perturbation theory around the null - surfaces . the first argument gives an explicit procedure to construct the action variable order by order in the perturbation theory ( sections 3 , 4.4 and 4.6 ) .",
    "the second argument uses the existence of the local conserved charges @xcite ( known as higher pohlmeyer charges ) and the results of the evaluation of these charges on the so - called `` rigid solutions '' performed in @xcite .",
    "the arguments in section 4 of our paper together with the results of @xcite suggest that the action variable is an infinite linear combination of the pohlmeyer charges and allow in principle to find the coefficients of this linear combination .    _",
    "the plan of the paper . _ in section 2 we will review the classification of the null - surfaces following mostly @xcite and stress that the moduli space of the null - surfaces is a @xmath9-bundle over a loop space . therefore it has a canonically defined action of @xmath9 . in section 3",
    "we will explain how to extend the action of @xmath9 from the null - surfaces to the nearly - degenerate extremal surfaces using the perturbation theory .",
    "a large part of section 3 is a review of @xcite . in section 4",
    "we discuss the geometrical meaning of this @xmath9 as an action variable and argue that it is an infinite sum of the local conserved charges .",
    "_ note added in the revised version . _",
    "the coefficients of the expansion of the action variable in the local conserved charges were fixed to all orders in the first paper of @xcite . here",
    "we consider only the pohlmeyer charges for the @xmath1 part of the string sigma - model .",
    "the role of the pohlmeyer charges for @xmath2 was discussed in the second paper of @xcite . in the special case when the motion of the string is restricted to @xmath10 the action variable discussed here corresponds to the action variable of the sine - gordon model , see the third paper of @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional surface in a space - time of lorentzian signature is called a null - surface if it has a degenerate metric and is ruled by the light rays .",
    "there is a connection between null - surfaces and extremal surfaces .",
    "an extremal surface is a two - dimensional surface with the induced metric of the signature @xmath11 which extremizes the area functional .",
    "extremal surfaces are solutions of the string worldsheet equation of motion in the purely geometrical background ( no @xmath12-field ) . when the string moves very fast , the metric on the worldsheet degenerates and the worldsheet becomes a null - surface .",
    "therefore a null - surface can be considered as a degenerate limit of an extremal surface .    in @xmath6",
    "there are two types of the light rays .",
    "the light rays of the first type project to points in @xmath1 .",
    "the light rays of the second type project to the timelike geodesics in @xmath2 and the equator of @xmath1 .",
    "the operators of the large r - charge correspond to the null - surfaces ruled by the light rays of the second type . ] .",
    "it is straightforward to explicitly describe all the null - surfaces of the second type in @xmath6 .",
    "we have to first describe the moduli space of the null - geodesics of the second type .",
    "an equator of @xmath1 is specified by a point in the coset space @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , a timelike geodesic in @xmath2 is specified by @xmath14 . given @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 be the corresponding equator in @xmath1 and timelike geodesic in @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "to specify a light ray in @xmath6 we have to give also a map @xmath19 which pulls back the angular coordinate on @xmath20 to the length parameter on @xmath21 ( see fig.[fig : ng ] ) .",
    "such maps are parametrized by @xmath22 .",
    "we see that each light ray is defined by a triple @xmath23",
    ". therefore , the moduli space of light - rays of the second type in @xmath6 is geometrically : @xmath24\\widetilde{\\times } s^1\\ ] ]    a null - surface is a one - parameter family of light rays .",
    "therefore it determines a contour in @xmath25\\widetilde{\\times } s^1 $ ] .",
    "but we have to also remember that an arbitrary collection of the light rays is not necessarily a null - surface .",
    "it is a null - surface only if the induced metric is degenerate . to understand what it means ,",
    "let us choose a space - like curve belonging to our surface .",
    "this space - like curve is a collection of points , one point on each light ray . for the surface to be null",
    ", the tangent vector to this curve at each point of the curve should be orthogonal to the light ray to which the point belongs .",
    "( this condition does not depend on how we choose a space - like curve . )",
    "what kind of a constraint does it impose on the contour ?",
    "the space @xmath25\\widetilde{\\times } s^1 $ ] is a @xmath9 bundle over @xmath26 .",
    "the condition of the degeneracy of the metric defines a _ connection _ on this bundle .",
    "the definition of this connection is : the curve in the total space is considered horizontal , precisely if the corresponding collection of light rays is a degenerate surface .",
    "what is the curvature of this connection ?",
    "both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are kahler manifolds ( if we forgive that the metric on the first coset is not positive - definite ) .",
    "let us denote the kahler forms @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the curvature of our @xmath9-bundle is @xmath31 .",
    "a curve in the base space @xmath32 can be lifted to the horizontal curve in the total space if and only if a two - dimensional film ending on this curve has an integer kahler area ( integral of @xmath31 over this film should be an integer ) .",
    "moreover , it is lifted as a horizontal curve almost unambiguously , except that there is a `` global '' action of @xmath9 shifting @xmath33 on every light ray by the same constant .",
    "therefore , the moduli space of null - surfaces is the @xmath9 bundle over the space of contours in @xmath32 subject to the integrality condition which we described .    to summarize , the moduli space of the null - surfaces of the second type is : @xmath34 here @xmath35 means the space of maps from the circle to @xmath36 ; for @xmath36 a kahler manifold @xmath37 means the space of maps satisfying the integrality condition . at this point",
    "we consider the null - surfaces without a parametrization ; therefore we divide by the group @xmath38 of the diffeomorphisms of the circle . turning on the fermionic degrees of freedom on the worldsheet we get the moduli space of supersymmetric null - surfaces @xcite : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the phase space of the continuous spin chain @xcite",
    ". therefore the moduli space of null - surfaces is `` almost '' equivalent to the phase space of the continuous spin chain , except for the fiber @xmath22 and the reparametrizations @xmath38 .",
    "we have to explain what happens to the fiber and why the null - surface actually comes with the parametrization .",
    "also , we have to explain how the symplectic structure is defined on the moduli space of null surfaces .",
    "let us start with the parametrization .",
    "the phase space of the classical string has a boundary which consists of strings `` moving with the speed of light '' .",
    "a string moving very fast can be approximated by a null - surface .",
    "but one null - surface can approximate many different fast moving strings .",
    "the null - surface as we defined it so far `` remembers '' only the _ direction _ of the velocity at each point of the approximated string , but it misses the information about the ratios of the relativistic factors @xmath41 at different points of the string . although @xmath42 in the null - surface limit , the ratio @xmath43 for two different points on the worldsheet remains finite . therefore ,",
    "if we want to think of the moduli space of the null - surfaces as the boundary of the phase space , we have to equip the null - surfaces with an additional structure .",
    "this additional structure is the _",
    "parametrization_.    a null - surface is a one - parameter family of the light rays .",
    "the parameterization is a particular choice of the parameter .",
    "in other words , it is a monotonic function @xmath44 from the family of light rays forming the null - surface to the circle , defined modulo @xmath45 .",
    "one can also think of it as a density @xmath46 on the set of light rays forming the null - surface .",
    "this density is roughly speaking proportional to the density of energy on the worldsheet of the fast - moving string , in the limit when it becomes the null - surface",
    ". we will now give the definition of @xmath44 .",
    "consider the family of string worldsheets @xmath47 converging to the null - surface @xmath48 .",
    "we will introduce a parametrization @xmath46 of @xmath49 in the following way . consider a killing vector field @xmath50 on @xmath1 , corresponding to some rotation of the sphere : @xmath51 here @xmath52 parametrizes the @xmath1 : @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 is large , @xmath47 is close to @xmath49 , the string moves very fast and the conserved charge corresponding to @xmath50 is very large .",
    "we can approximate this charge by an integral over a spacial contour on the null - surface @xmath49 of @xmath55 times some density @xmath46 : @xmath56 } d\\sigma\\ ; u^{ij } \\ ;      x_{0,s}^i\\partial_{\\tau}x_{0,s}^j+(\\mbox{terms vanishing at } l\\to \\infty)\\ ] ] here @xmath57 is the @xmath1-part of the null - surface ; we choose the @xmath58 coordinate on the null - surface to be the affine parameter on the light ray normalized by the condition @xmath59 .",
    "( [ ncd ] ) with the condition @xmath60 is the definition of @xmath46 , and also the precise definition of the large parameter @xmath54 , modulo @xmath61 .",
    "we choose @xmath44 as the parametrization .",
    "we can now say that _ the moduli space of parametrized null - surfaces is the boundary of the phase space of a classical string .",
    "_ we say that a family @xmath47 of extremal surfaces has a _",

    "( [ ncd ] ) in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "this definition of the parametrization does not depend on which particular geometrical symmetry @xmath50 we use . an alternative way to define",
    "the same parametrization is to use a special choice of the worldsheet coordinates on @xmath64 .",
    "let us choose the worldsheet coordinates @xmath65 so that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the projection of the string worldsheet to @xmath2 and @xmath68 is the projection to @xmath1",
    ". then we define @xmath69 . in the null - surface limit @xmath46",
    "defines the parametrization of the null - surface .      the moduli space of parametrized null - surfaces as a manifold depends only on the conformal structure of the target space .",
    "but we can introduce additional structures on this moduli space which use the metric on @xmath6 .",
    "an important additional structure is the closed 2-form which originates from the symplectic form of the classical string .",
    "strictly speaking a differential form in the bulk of the manifold does not automatically determine a differential form on the boundary .",
    "indeed , suppose that we have a differential form , for example a 2-form @xmath70 in the bulk .",

    "when we lift the vector field @xmath83 on the boundary to the vector field @xmath84 in the bulk , let us require that @xmath85 goes to zero when @xmath62 .",

    "( [ supersymmetric ] ) .",
    "the moduli space has a symmetry @xmath9 rotating this fiber ; we will discuss this symmetry in the next section ; we will call it @xmath88 .",
    "therefore @xmath71 is the symplectic form on the moduli space of null - surfaces modulo @xmath88 .",
    "( [ supersymmetric ] ) implies that the moduli space of _ parametrized _ null - surfaces _ modulo _ @xmath88 is the space of parametrized contours in the grassmanian : @xmath89 one can see that @xmath71 is equal to the integral of the symplectic form on the super - grassmanian pointwise on the contour , with the measure @xmath46 .",
    "the symplectic area of the film filling the contour is the generating function of the shift of the origin of the circle .",
    "therefore the integrality condition guarantees that the symplectic form does not depend on the choice of the origin on @xmath22 ; the symplectic form is horizontal and invariant with respect to the shifts of the origin of @xmath22 .    our definition of the symplectic form on the space of null - surfaces used the target space metric ( just the conformal structure would not be enough ) and also the fact that the target space is a product of two manifolds .",
    "our discussion in this and the next section will be limited to the classical bosonic string .",
    "the moduli space ( [ supersymmetric ] ) of null - surfaces is a @xmath9-bundle .",
    "the @xmath9 symmetry shifting in the fiber @xmath22 plays an important role in the formalism",
    ". we will call it @xmath88 . on fig .",
    "[ fig : nss ] we have shown schematically how @xmath88 acts on the null - surfaces .    we conjecture that @xmath88 corresponds to the length of the spin chain . generally speaking",

    "it should be conserved modulo the corrections vanishing in the continuous limit .",
    "we therefore conjecture that there is a continuation of @xmath88 from the space of null - surfaces to the phase space of the classical string , at least to the region of the phase space corresponding to fast moving strings .",
    "we conjecture that this continuation is uniquely defined by the following properties :    1 .",

    "these arguments lead us to the following conclusion .",
    "first , we see once again that there is a linear combination @xmath319 generating periodic trajectories .",
    "second , the moduli space of null - surfaces in @xmath6 modulo @xmath88 is naturally equipped with the infinite tower of hamiltonians in involution which are the null - surface limit of the pohlmeyer charges . this is the generalized landau - lifshitz model .",
    "given a manifold with the metric of the lorentzian signature it is possible to construct the extremal surfaces in this manifold as perturbations of the null - surfaces .",
    "in the special case when the manifold is @xmath6 the ads / cft correspondence predicts that the extremal surfaces ( which are the same as classical string worldsheets ) correspond to the states of the large r - charge in the @xmath7 supersymmetric yang - mills theory . from this point of view considering the extremal surface as a perturbation around the null - surface corresponds to considering the state of the interacting yang - mills theory as a perturbation of the state of the free yang - mills theory .",
    "this correspondence has the following important features :    1 .   locality . in the planar limit ( the limit of infinitely many colors )",
    "the yang - mills perturbation theory is local in the following sense : the feynman diagramms involve only intractions of those elementary field operators which stand next to each other in the product under the trace .",
    "we expect that the correspondence between the parton chains and the string worldsheets is local in each order of the perturbation theory , and therefore the locality of the planar yang - mills perturbation theory should correspond to the locality of the string worldsheet theory .",
    "2 .   integrability .",
    "the classical string worldsheet theory in @xmath6 is an integrable system .",
    "because of the integrability , there is an infinite family of local conserved charges in involution . in this paper",
    "we have argued that an infinite linear combination of these local charges generates periodic trajectories on the string phase space .",
    "this statement can be verified order by order in the null - surface perturbation theory , and it is local at each order .",
    "this means that the `` slow evolution '' of nearly - degenerate extremal surfaces @xcite is essentially controlled by the pohlmeyer charges ( we will further discuss the slow evolution and how it is related to the pohlmeyer charges in the second paper of @xcite )",
    ".    it would be interesting to further study the null - surface perturbation theory from the point of view of the integrability",
    ". it would be especially interesting to study those manifestations of the integrability which are local .",
    "the bcklund transformations @xcite is one example .",
    "they allow us to construct a new extremal surface from a given extremal surface , and in the null - surface perturbation theory these transformations are well - defined and local at each order .",
    "the bcklund tranformations are closely related to the local conserved charges , and in fact the hidden symmetry @xmath88 can be considered as a consequence of the special properties of these transformations .",
    "we will discuss the relation between @xmath88 and the bcklund transformations in the third paper of @xcite .",
    "the general problem is , to study those aspects of the integrability which are local in the null - surface perturbation theory .",
    "( without a reference to the null - surface perturbation theory , we would define the locality as some sort of an independence of the choice of the boundary conditions . )",
    "this problem arises also on the field theory side .",
    "the feynman diagramms in the planar limit are local , but we usually compute the anomalous dimension of the single - trace operators which requires summing over the whole parton chain .",
    "the spectrum of single - trace operators at large @xmath8 is certainly an invariant of the theory , but it is non - local . if it is true that the planar @xmath7 yang - mills theory is integrable , it would be important to understand the integrability as much as possible in terms of the local properties of the parton chain ( perhaps on the level of the individual feynman diagramms ) .",
    "we have defined the @xmath88 strictly speaking in the perturbation theory , but it should be actually well - defined in the domain of the string phase space where the velocity of the string is large enough . in other words , the series defining the @xmath88 in fact converges if the string moves fast enough .",
    "it would be interesting to study the global properties of @xmath88 .",
    "an important question is what happens to @xmath88 after the quantization . to answer this question",
    "we should first include fermions .",
    "important steps in this direction were made recently in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand better why the `` length '' is conserved on the field theory side .",
    "( why is there a quantum number @xmath54 with a well - defined classical limit ? ) to which extent the conservation of @xmath54 is related to the integrability of the planar yang - mills theory ?",
    "what happens to @xmath54 when we turn on the fermions ?",
    "null - surfaces are obviously an important ingredient in our construction .",
    "the correspondence between the null - surfaces and the `` engineering '' operators in the free field theory is rather straightforward ; the null - surfaces in @xmath6 appear very naturally in the description of the coherent states of the free theory @xcite .",
    "is there any way to see directly on the field theory side , that turning on the yang - mills interaction corresponds to the deformation of the null - surface into the extremal surface ?",
