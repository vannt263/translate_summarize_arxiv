    "over the last decades string theory guts have aroused considerable interest .",
    "recent progress has been focused in f - theory  @xcite effective models  @xcite-@xcite which incorporate several constraints attributed to the topological properties of the compactified space .",
    "indeed , in this context the gauge symmetries are associated to the singularities of the elliptically fibred compactification manifold . as such , gut symmetries",
    "are obtained as a subgroup of @xmath5 and the matter content emerges from the decomposition of the @xmath5-adjoint representation  ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "as is well known , gut symmetries , have several interesting features such as the unification of gauge couplings and the accommodation of fermions in simple representations . yet , they fail to explain the fermion mass hierarchy and more generally , to impose sufficient constraints on the superpotential terms .",
    "hence , depending on the specific model , several rare processes -including proton decay- are not adequately suppressed .",
    "we may infer that , a realistic description of the observed low energy physics world , requires the existence of additional symmetry structure of the effective model , beyond the simple gut group .",
    "experimental observations on limits regarding exotic processes ( such as baryon and lepton number as well as flavour violating cases ) and in particular neutrino physics seem to be nicely explained when the standard model or certain guts are extended to include abelian and discrete symmetries . on purely phenomenological grounds , @xmath6 as well as non - abelian discrete symmetries such as @xmath7 and so on , have already been successfully implemented .",
    "however , in this context there is no principle to single out the family symmetry group from the enormous number of possible finite groups .",
    "moreover , the choice of the scalar spectrum and the higgs vev alignments introduce another source of arbitrariness in the models .",
    "in contrast to the above picture , f - theory constructions offer an interesting framework for restricting both the gauge ( gut and discrete ) symmetries as well as the available higgs sector . in the elliptic fibration we end up with an 8-dimensional theory with a gauge group of ade type . in this work",
    "we will focus in the simplest unified symmetry which is @xmath0 gut . in the present geometric picture ,",
    "the @xmath0 gut is supported by 7-branes wrapping an appropriate ( del pezzo ) surface @xmath8 on the internal manifold , while the number of chiral states is given in terms of a topological index formula .",
    "moreover , there is no use of adjoint higgs representations since the breaking down to the standard model symmetry can occur by turning on a non - trivial @xmath9 flux along the hypercharge generator  @xcite . at the same time",
    "this mechanism determines exactly the standard model matter content .",
    "further , if the flux parameters are judiciously chosen they may provide a solution to the well known doublet triplet splitting problem of the higgs sector . in short , in f - theory one can in principle develop all those necessary tools to determine the gut group and predict the matter content of the effective theory .    in the present work we will revisit a class of @xmath0 susy gut models which arise in the context of the spectral cover .",
    "the reason is that the recent developments in f - theory provide now a clearer insight and a better perspective of these constructions .",
    "for example , developments on computations of the yukawa couplings@xcite-@xcite have shown that a reasonable mass hierarchy and mixing may arise even if more than one of the fermion families reside on the same matter curve .",
    "this implies that effective models left over with only a few matter curves after certain monodromy identifications could be viable and it would be worth reconsidering them .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the case of the klein group monodromy @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , with this particular spectral cover , there are two main ways to implement its monodromy action , depending on whether @xmath10 is a transitive or non - transitive subgroup of @xmath11 .",
    "a significant part of the present work will be devoted to the viability of the corresponding two kinds of effective models .",
    "another ingredient related to the predictability of the model , is the implementation of r - parity conservation , or equivalently a @xmath2 matter parity , which can be realised with the introduction of new geometric symmetries  @xcite respected from the spectral cover . in view of these interesting features",
    ", we also investigate in more detail the superpotential , computing higher non - renormalisable corrections , analysing the d and f - flatness conditions and so on .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a short description of the derivation of @xmath0 gut in the context of f - theory . in section 3",
    "we describe the action of monodromies and their role in model building .",
    "we further focus on the klein group monodromy and the corresponding spectral cover factorisations which is our main concern in the present work . in section 4",
    "we review a few well known mathematical results and theorems which will be used in model building of the subsequent sections . in section 5",
    "we discuss effective field theory models with klein group monodromy and implement the idea of matter parity of geometric origin .",
    "section 6 deals with the particle spectrum , the yukawa sector and other properties and predictions of the effective standard model obtained from the above analysis .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "in this section we explain the main setup of these class of models . focusing in the case under consideration , i.e. the gut @xmath0 , the effective four dimensional model can be reached from the maximal @xmath5 gauge symmetry through the decomposition @xmath12 in the elliptic fibration , we know that an @xmath13 singularity is described by the tate equation y^2=x^3+b_0 z^5 + b_2 xz^3+b_3yz^2+b_4 x^2z+b_5xy where the homologies of the coefficients in the above equation are given by : @xmath14&=\\eta - kc_1\\\\   \\eta&=6c_1-t   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the chern classes of the tangent and normal bundles respectively .",
    "the first @xmath0 is defining the gut group of the effective theory , the second @xmath17 incorporates additional symmetries of the effective theory while it can be described in the context of the spectral cover . indeed , in this picture , one can depict the non - abelian higgs bundle in terms of the adjoint scalar field configuration  @xcite and work with the higgs eigenvalues and eigenvectors . for @xmath18",
    "these emerge as roots of a characteristic polynomial of @xmath19-th degree .",
    "thus the @xmath0 spectral surface @xmath20 is represented by the fifth order polynomial = b_0s^5+b_1s^4+b_2s^3+b_3s^2+b_4s+b_5 = b_0 ^5_i=1(s - t_i)[sc10 ] since the roots are associated to the @xmath0 cartan subalgebra their sum is zero , @xmath21 , thus we have put @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 representations are found at certain ehnancements of the @xmath0 singularity . in particular , for this purpose the relevant quantities are  @xcite @xmath25 at the @xmath26 locus the enhanced singularity is @xmath27 and the intersection defines the matter curve accommodating the @xmath28 s .",
    "fiveplets are found at a matter curve defined at an @xmath29 enhancement associated to the locus @xmath30 .    in practive , we are interested in phenomenologically viable cases where the spectral cover splits in several pieces .",
    "consider for example the splitting expressed through the breaking chain @xmath31 where we assumed breaking of @xmath17 along the cartan , @xmath21 .",
    "the presence of four @xmath6 s in the effective theory leaves no room for a viable superpotential , since many of the required terms , including the top yukawa coupling , are not allowed .",
    "nevertheless , monodromies imply various kinds of symmetries among the roots @xmath32 of the spectral cover polynomial which can be used to relax these tight constraints .",
    "the particular relations among these roots depend on the details of the compactification and the geometrical properties of the internal manifold .",
    "all possible ways fall into some galois group which in the case of @xmath17 is a subgroup of the corresponding weyl group , i.e. , the group @xmath33 of all possible permutations of the five cartan weights @xmath32 .",
    "it is obvious that there are several options and each of them leads to models with completely different properties and predictions of the effective field theory . before starting our investigations on the effective models derived in the context of the aforementioned monodromy",
    ", we will analyse these issues in the next section .",
    "for the @xmath34 model , we have seen that any possible remnant symmetries ( embedable in the @xmath5 singularity ) must be contained in @xmath17 . we have already explained that in the spectral cover approach we quotient the theory by the action of a finite group  @xcite which is expected to descend from a geometrical symmetry of the compactification .",
    "starting form an @xmath20 spectral cover , the local field theory is determined by the @xmath0 gut group and the cartan subalgebra of @xmath17 modulo the weyl group @xmath35 .",
    "this is the group @xmath33 , the permutation symmetry of five elements which in the present case correspond to the cartan weights @xmath36 .",
    "depending on the geometry of the manifold , @xmath20 may slit to several factors @xmath37 for the present work , we will assume two cases where the compactification geometry implies the splitting of the spectral cover to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "assuming the splitting @xmath38 , the permutation takes place between the four roots , say @xmath40 , and the corresponding weyl group is @xmath11 .",
    "notwithstanding , under specific geometries to be discussed in the subsequent sections , the monodromy may be described by the klein group @xmath41 .",
    "the latter might be either transitive or non transitive .",
    "this second case implies the spectral cover factorisation @xmath42 . as a result , there are two non - trivial identifications acting on the pairs @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively while both are described by the weyl group @xmath45 . since @xmath46 , we conclude that in this case the monodromy action is the non - transitive klein group @xmath47 .",
    "next , we will analyse the basic features of these two spectral cover factorisations .",
    "the group of all permutations of four elements , @xmath11 , has a total of @xmath48 elements .",
    "group is given by @xmath49 these include 2,3,4 and 2 + 2-cycles , all of which are listed in .",
    "these cycles form a total of 30 subgroups of @xmath11 , shown in . of these",
    "there are those subgroups that are transitive subgroups of @xmath11 : the whole group , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the klein group .",
    "we focus now in compactification geometries consistent with the klein group monodromy @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that there are three non - transitive @xmath10 subgroups within @xmath11 and only one transitive subgroup .",
    "this transitive klein group is the subgroup of the @xmath50 subgroup .",
    "considering , one can see that @xmath50 is the group of all even permutations of four elements and the transitive @xmath10 is that group excluding 3-cycles .",
    "the significance of this is that in the case of galois theory , to be discussed in section [ galois theory ] , the transitive subgroups @xmath50 and @xmath10 are necessarily irreducible quartic polynomials , while the non - transitive @xmath10 subgroups of @xmath11 should be reducible .    ,",
    "the group of all permutations of four elements - representative of the symmetries of a cube.[spider ] ]    .a summary of the permutation cycles of @xmath11 , categorised by cycle size and whether or not those cycles are contained within the transitive subgroups @xmath50 and @xmath10 .",
    "this also shows that @xmath10 is necessarily a transitive subgroup of @xmath50 , since it contains all the @xmath53-cycles of @xmath50 and the identity only .",
    "[ cycles ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      having written down a spectrum that has the phenomenologically preferred r - parity , we must now examine the allowed couplings of the model .",
    "the model only allows yukawa couplings to arise at non - renormalisable levels , however the resulting couplings give rise to rank three mass matrices .",
    "this is because the perpendicular group charges must be canceled out in any yukawa couplings .",
    "for example , the yukawa arising from @xmath54 has a charge @xmath55 , which may be canceled by the @xmath56 singlets .",
    "consider the yukawas of the top sector , @xmath57 where the numbers indicate generations ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the resulting mass matrix should be rank three , however the terms will not all be created equally and the rank theorem @xcite should lead to suppression of operators arising from the same matter curve combination : @xmath58 where each element of the matrix has some arbitrary coupling constant .",
    "we use here @xmath59 to denote suppression due to the effects of the rank theorem @xcite for yukawas arising from the same gut operators .",
    "the lightest generation will have the lightest mass due to an extra gut scale suppression arising from the second singlet involved in the yukawa .",
    "there are a large number of corrections at higher orders in singlet vevs , which we have not included here for brevity .",
    "these corrections will also be less significant compared to the lowest order contributions .    in a similar way ,",
    "the down - type yukawa couplings arise as non - renormalisable operators , coming from four different combinations .",
    "the operators for this sector often exploit the tracelessness of , so that the sum of the gut charges must vanish .",
    "the leading order yukawa operators , @xmath60 the resulting mass matrix will , like in the top sector , be a rank three matrix , with a similar form : @xmath61 the structure of the top and bottom sectors appears to be quite similar in this model , which should provide a suitable hierarchy to both sectors .",
    "the charged leptons will have a different structure to the bottom - type quarks in this model , due primarily to the fact the @xmath62 matter is localised on one gut tenplet .",
    "the lepton doublets however all reside on different @xmath63 representations , which will fill out the matrix in a non - trivial way , with the operators : @xmath64 the mass matrix for the charged lepton sector will be subject to suppressions arising due to the effects discussed above .",
    "the spectrum contains two singlets that do not have vacuum expectation values , which protects the model from certain classes of dangerous operators .",
    "these singlets , @xmath65 , also serve as candidates for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "let us make the assignment @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this gives dirac masses from two sources , the first of which involve all lepton doublets and @xmath68 : @xmath69 this generates a hierarchy for neutrinos , however the effect will be mitigated by the operators arising from the @xmath70 singlet : @xmath71 if all these dirac mass operators are present in the low energy spectrum , then the neutrino sector should have masses that mix greatly .",
    "this is compatible with our understanding of neutrinos from experiments , which requires large mixing angles compared to the other sectors .",
    "a light mass scale for the neutrinos can be generated using the seesaw mechanism @xcite , which requires large right - handed majorana masses to generate light physical left - handed majorana neutrino mass at low values .",
    "the singlets involved in this scenario has perpendicular charges that must be canceled out , as with the quark and charged lepton operators .",
    "fortunately , this can be achieved , in part due to the presence of @xmath72 , which have the same charge combinations as @xmath73 . the leading contribution to",
    "the mass term will come from the off diagonal @xmath74 term , however there are diagonal contributions : @xmath75 two right - handed neutrinos are sufficient to generate the appropriate physical light masses for the neutrinos required by experimental constraints @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of this model is the requirement of extra higgs fields . due to the flux factors , under doublet - triplet",
    "splitting it is necessary to have two copies of the up and down - type higgs .",
    "this insures that the model is free of higgs colour triplets , @xmath76 in the massless spectrum , while also allowing the designation of @xmath77 parity to higgs matter curves . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the @xmath78-term for the higgs mass would seem to give four higgs operators of the same mass : @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "however , since for both the up and down - types there are two copies on the matter curve , we can call upon the rank theorem @xcite . consider the operator for the @xmath78-term",
    ": @xmath81 this operator will give a mass that is naturally large for one generation of the higgs , while the second mass should be suppressed due to non - perturbative effects .",
    "this is parameterised by @xmath82 , which is required to be sufficiently small as to allow a higgs to be present at the electroweak scale , while the leading order higgsl must be heavy enough to remain at a reasonably high scale and not prevent unification .",
    "thus we should have a light higgs boson as well as a heavier copy that is as of yet undetected .",
    "the spectrum is free of the higgs colour triplets @xmath76 , however we must still consider operators of the types @xmath83 and @xmath84 , since the colour triplets may appear in the spectrum at the string scale . of these types of operator ,",
    "most are forbidden at leading order due to the charges of the perpendicular group .",
    "however , one operator is allowed and we must consider this process : @xmath85 none of the operators arising are solely first generation matter , however due to mixing they may contribute to any proton decay rate .",
    "the model in question only has one of each type of higgs matter curve , which means any colour triplet partners must respect the perpendicular charges of those curves .",
    "the result of this requirement is that the vertex between the initial quarks and the @xmath86 colour triplet must also include a singlet to balance the charge , with the same requirement for the final vertex .",
    "the resulting operator should be suppressed by some high scale where the colour triplets are appearing in the spectrum - @xmath87 .",
    "the most dangerous contribution of this operator can be assume to be the @xmath88 component , which will mix most strongly with the lightest generation .",
    "it can be estimated that , given the quark mixing and the mixing structure of the charged leptons in particular , the suppression scale should be in the region @xmath89 .",
    "this estimate seems to place the suppression of proton decay at too small a value , though not wildly inconsistent .",
    "however , if we consider , we can see that while the external legs of this process give an overall adherence to the charges of the perpendicular group charges , the vertices require singlet contributions . for example , the first vertex is @xmath90 , which is nonrenormalisable and we can not write down a series of renormalisable operators to mediate this effective operator . this is because the combination of perpendicular group and gut charges constrain heavily the operators we can write down , which means proton decay can be seen to be suppressed here by the dynamics as well as the symmetries required by the f - theory formalism .",
    "the full determination of the coupling strengths of any process of this type in f - theory should be found through computing the overlap integral of the wavefunctions involved @xcite , and this will be discussed in upcoming work on r - parity violating processes .",
    "we have revisited a class of @xmath0 susy gut models which arise in the context of the spectral cover with klein group monodromy @xmath1 . by investigating the symmetry structures of the spectral cover equation and the defining equations of the mater",
    "curves it is possible to understand the f - theory geometric origin of matter parity , which has hitherto been just assumed in an _ ad hoc _ way .",
    "in particular , we have shown how the simplest @xmath2 matter parities can be realised via the new geometric symmetries respected by the spectral cover . by exploiting the various ways that these symmetries can be assigned ,",
    "there are a large number of possible variants .",
    "we have identified a rather minimal example of this kind , where the low energy effective theory below the gut scale is just the mssm with no exotics and standard matter parity .",
    "furthermore , by deriving general properties of the singlet sector , consistent with string vacua , including the d and f - flatness conditions , we were able to identify two singlets , which provide suitable candidates for a two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we were thus able to derive the mssm extended by a two right - handed neutrino seesaw mechanism .",
    "we also computed all baryon and lepton number violating operators emerging from higher non - renormalisable operators and found all dangerous operators to be forbidden .",

    "mcr acknowledges support from the fct under the grant sfrh / bd/84234/2012 .",
    "the super potential for the singlets involves a total of thirteen fields , which couple in such as way as to cancel all their perpendicular group charges and to have consistent parity .",
    "@xmath91 in order to establish flatness of the f - terms , we must consider @xmath92 , giving a total of thirteen equations , each of which must vanish .",
    "the solution of this system of equations should be such that none of the coefficients are required to take special values to be natural and free of fine tuning .",
    "the only constraint coming from the model discussed in section [ s : mod ] is that @xmath65 not have a vacuum expectation to protect from dangerous operators .",
    "this requirement does not over constrain the equations or create any unsightly relations , however it also leaves a solution of the f - term alignment that is hard to write down in a concise manner due to the complexity of the equations involved .",
