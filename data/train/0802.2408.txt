    "in these notes we shall eventually describe recent developments in the stability theory of solitons ( or more precisely , _ solitary waves _ ) . before we discuss solitons , however , we need to first describe the wider context of dispersive equations , and why even the very existence of solitons were initially such a surprising phenomenon .    in classical physics",
    ", it has been realised for centuries that the behaviour of idealised vibrating media ( such as waves on string , on the surface of a body of water , or in air ) , in the absence of friction or other dissipative forces , can be modeled by a number of partial differential equations , known collectively as _ dispersive equations_. model examples of such equations include the following :    * the _ free wave equation _",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the amplitude @xmath2 of a wave at a point in a spacetime with @xmath3 spatial dimensions , @xmath4 is the spatial laplacian on @xmath5 , @xmath6 is short for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a fixed constant ( which can be rescaled to equal @xmath9 if one wishes ) .",
    "this equation models the evolution of waves in a medium which has a fixed speed @xmath10 of propagation in all directions . * the _ linear ( time - dependent )",
    "schrdinger equation _",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the wave function of a quantum particle , @xmath13 are physical constants ( which can be rescaled to equal @xmath9 if one wishes ) , and @xmath14 is a potential function , which we assume to depend only on the spatial variable @xmath15 .",
    "this equation models the evolution of a quantum particle in space in the presence of a classical potential well @xmath16 . *",
    "the _ nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation _",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is an exponent and @xmath19 is a sign ( the case @xmath20 is known as the _ defocusing _ case , and @xmath21 as the _ focusing _ case ) .",
    "this equation can be viewed as a variant of the linear schrdinger equation ( with the constants @xmath22 and @xmath23 normalised away ) , in which the potential @xmath16 now depends in a nonlinear fashion on the solution itself .",
    "this equation no longer has a physical interpretation as the evolution of a quantum particle , but can be derived as a model for quantum media such as bose - einstein condensates ( see e.g. @xcite ) . *",
    "the _ ( time - dependent ) airy equation _",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is a scalar function .",
    "this equation can be derived as a very simplified model for propagation of low amplitude water waves in a shallow canal , by starting with the euler equations , making a number of simplifying assumptions to discard nonlinear terms , and the normalising all constants to equal @xmath9 . *",
    "the _ korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath26 which is a more refined version of the airy equation in which the first nonlinear term is retained .",
    "the constant @xmath27 that appears here is not essential , but turns out to be convenient when connecting this equation to the theory of inverse scattering ( of which more will be said later ) . *",
    "the _ generalised korteweg - de vries ( gkdv ) equation _",
    "@xmath28 for @xmath18 an integer ; the case @xmath29 is essentially the kdv equation , and the case @xmath30 is known as the _ modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation_. the case @xmath31 is particularly interesting due to its _ mass - critical _ nature , which we will discuss later .    for simplicity ( to avoid some non - trivial topological phenomena , which are an interesting topic which we have no space to discuss here ) we shall only consider equations on flat spacetimes @xmath32 , and only consider solutions which decay to zero at spatial infinity .",
    "the above equations are all evolution equations ; if we specify the initial position @xmath33 of a wave at time @xmath34 , we expect these equations to have a unique solution with that initial data . ] for all future times @xmath35 .",
    "actually , all of the above equations are time - reversible ( for instance , if @xmath36 solves , then @xmath37 also solves ) so we also expect the initial data at time @xmath34 to determine the solution at all past times @xmath38 .",
    "( this is in sharp contrast to _ dissipative _ equations such as the heat equation @xmath39 , which are solvable forward in time but are not solvable backwards in time , at least in the category of smooth functions , due to an irreversible loss of energy and information inherent in this equation as time moves forward . )",
    "solutions to the above equations have two properties , which may seem at first to contradict each other .",
    "the first property is that all of these equations are _ conservative _ ; there exists a _ hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath40 , which is a functional that assigns a real number @xmath41 to any ( sufficiently smooth and decaying .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further discussion . ] ) function @xmath42 on the spatial domain @xmath5 , such that the hamiltonian of the solution at time @xmath43 as well as the instantaneous position @xmath44 . ]",
    "@xmath45 of a ( sufficiently smooth and decaying ) solution @xmath44 to the above equation is conserved in time : @xmath46 more specifically , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath47 for the wave equation , @xmath48 for the linear schrdinger equation , @xmath49 for the nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath50 for the airy equation , @xmath51 for the korteweg - de vries equation , and @xmath52 for the generalised korteweg - de vries equation . in all of these cases , the conservation of the hamiltonian can be formally verified by computing @xmath53 via differentiation under the integral sign , substituting the evolution equation for @xmath54 , and then integrating by parts ; we leave this to the reader as an exercise .    actually ,",
    "the hamiltonian is not the only conserved quantity available for these equations ; each of these equations also enjoy a number of symmetries ( e.g. translation invariance ) , which ( by noether s theorem ) leads to a number of important additional conserved quantities , which we will discuss later .",
    "it is often helpful to interpret the hamiltonian as describing the total _",
    "energy _ of the wave .",
    "the conservative nature of these equations means that even for very late times @xmath43 , the state @xmath44 of solution is still , which can be a difficult task to establish rigorously , especially if the initial data was rough .",
    "again , we suppress these important technical issues for simplicity . ]",
    "`` similar '' to the initial state @xmath55 , in the sense that they have the same energy .",
    "this may lead one to conclude that solutions to these evolution equations should evolve in a fairly static , or fairly periodic manner ; after all , this is what happens to solutions to finite - dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations which have a conserved energy @xmath56 which is _ coercive _ in the sense that the _ energy surfaces _",
    "@xmath57 are always bounded .    however , this intuition turns out to not be correct in the realm of dispersive equations , even though such equations can be thought of as infinite - dimensional systems of ode with a conserved energy , and even though this energy usually exhibits coercive properties .",
    "this is ultimately because of a second property of all of these equations , namely _",
    "dispersion_. informally , dispersion means that different components of a solution @xmath54 to any of these equations travel at different velocities , with the velocity of each component determined by the frequency . as a consequence , even though the state of solution at late times has the same energy as the initial state , the different components of the solution are often so dispersed that the solution at late times tends to have much smaller amplitudes than at early times .",
    "thus , for instance , it is perfectly possible for the solution @xmath44 to go to zero in @xmath58 norm as @xmath59 , even as its energy stays constant ( and non - zero ) .",
    "the ability to go to zero as measured in one norm , while staying bounded away from zero in another , is a feature of systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom , which is not present when considering systems of ode with only boundedly many degrees of freedom .",
    "one can see this dispersive effect in a number of ways .",
    "one ( somewhat informal ) way is to analyse _ plane wave _",
    "solutions @xmath60 for some non - zero amplitude @xmath61 , some temporal frequency @xmath62 , and some spatial frequency @xmath63 .",
    "for instance , for the airy equation , one easily verifies that solves to to be complex - valued here rather than real - valued , but this is of course a minor change . ]",
    "exactly when @xmath64 ; this equation is known as the _ dispersion relation _ for the airy equation .",
    "if we rewrite the right - hand side of in this case as @xmath65 , this asserts that a plane wave solution to has a _ phase velocity _",
    "@xmath66 which is the negative square of its spatial frequency @xmath67 . thus we see that for this equation , higher frequency plane waves have a much faster phase velocity than lower frequency ones , and the velocity is always in a leftward direction .",
    "similar analyses can be carried out for the other equations given above , though in those equations involving a nonlinearity or a potential , one has to restrict attention to small amplitude or high frequency solutions so that one can ( non - rigorously ) neglect the effect of these terms .",
    "for instance , for the schrdinger equation ( at least with @xmath68 ) one has the dispersion relation @xmath69    however , as is well known in physics , the phase velocity does not determine the speed of propagation of information in a system ; that quality is instead controlled by the _ group velocity _ , which typically is slightly different from the phase velocity . to explain this quantity ,",
    "let us modify the ansatz by allowing the amplitude @xmath61 to vary slowly in space , and propagate in time at some velocity @xmath70 . more precisely , we consider solutions of the form @xmath71 where @xmath61 is a smooth function and @xmath72 is a small parameter , and we shall be vague about what the symbol `` @xmath73 '' means .",
    "if we have @xmath64 as before , then a short ( and slightly non - rigorous ) computation shows that @xmath74 thus we see that in order for @xmath54 to ( approximately ) solve up to errors of @xmath75 , the group velocity @xmath42 must be equal to @xmath76 , which is three times the phase velocity @xmath66 .",
    "thus , at a qualitative level at least , we still have the same predicted behaviour as before ; all frequencies propagate leftward , and higher frequencies propagate faster than lower ones .",
    "in particular we expect localised high - amplitude states , which can be viewed ( via the fourier inversion formula ) as linear superpositions of plane waves of many different frequencies , to disperse leftwards over time into broader , lower - amplitude states ( but still with the same energy as the original state , of course ) .",
    "one can perform similar analyses for other equations .",
    "for instance , for the linear schrdinger equation , and assuming either high frequencies or small potential , one expects waves to propagate at a velocity proportional to their frequency , according to _ de broglie s law _ @xmath77 ; similarly for the nonlinear schrdinger equation when one assumes either high frequencies or small amplitude . in contrast , for wave equation",
    ", this analysis suggests that waves of ( non - zero ) frequency @xmath67 should propagate at velocities @xmath78 ; thus the propagation speed @xmath10 is constant but the propagation direction @xmath79 varies with frequency , leading to a weak dispersive effect . for more general dispersive equations , the group velocity can be read off of the dispersion relation @xmath80 by the formula @xmath81 ( whereas in contrast , the phase velocity is @xmath82 ) .    in the case of the schrdinger equation with @xmath68",
    ", one can see the dispersive effort more directly by using the explicit solution formula @xmath83 for @xmath84 and all sufficiently smooth and decaying initial data @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , we immediately conclude from this formula ( formally , at least ) that if @xmath85 is absolutely integrable , then @xmath86 decays at the rate @xmath87 .    in the case of linear equations such as the airy equation",
    ", there is a similar explicit formula ( involving the airy function @xmath88 instead of complex exponentials ) , but one can avoid the use of special functions by instead proceeding using the fourier transform and the principle of stationary phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) . indeed , by starting with the fourier inversion formula @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the fourier transform of @xmath85 , and noting as before that @xmath91 is the solution of the airy equation with initial data @xmath92 , we see from the principle of superposition ( and ignoring issues of interchanging derivatives and integrals , etc . ) that the solution @xmath54 is given by the formula @xmath93 if @xmath85 is a schwartz function ( infinitely smooth , with all derivaives decreasing faster than any polynomial ) , then its fourier transform is also schwartz and thus slowly varying .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath43 increases , the phase @xmath94 oscillates more and more rapidly ( for non - zero @xmath67 ) , and so we expect an increasing amount of cancellation in the integral in , leading to decay of @xmath54 as @xmath95 .",
    "this intuition can be formalised using the methods of stationary phase ( which can be viewed as advanced applications of the undergraduate calculus tools of integration by parts and changes of variable ) , and can for instance be used to show that @xmath96 decays at a rate @xmath97 in general .",
    "this technique of representing a solution as a superposition of plane waves also works ( with a twist ) for the linear schrdinger equation in the presence of a potential @xmath16 , provided that the potential is sufficiently smooth and decaying .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the plane waves by _ distorted plane waves _",
    "@xmath98 , where ( in order to solve ) @xmath99 has to solve the _ time - independent schrdinger equation _ @xmath100 and then to try to represent solutions @xmath54 to as superpositions @xmath101 where we are being intentionally vague as to what the range of integration is .",
    "if we restrict attention to negative values of @xmath102 , then it turns out ( by use of scattering theory ) that we can construct distorted plane waves @xmath103 which asymptotically resemble the standard plane waves @xmath104 as @xmath105 , where @xmath67 is a frequency obeying the dispersion relation .",
    "if @xmath54 is composed entirely of these waves , then one has a similar dispersive behaviour to the free schrdinger equation ( for instance , under suitable regularity and decay hypotheses on @xmath16 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 will continue to decay like @xmath106 ) .",
    "in such cases we say that @xmath54 is in a _ radiating state_. in many important cases ( such as when the potential @xmath16 is non - negative , or is small in certain function space norms ) , all states ( with suitable regularity and decay hypotheses ) are radiating states . however , when @xmath16 is large and allowed to be negative , it is also possible does not decay rapidly , then there can also be some intermediate states involving the singular continuous spectrum of the schrdinger operator @xmath107 , which disperse over time slower than the radiating states but faster than the bound states .",
    "one can also occasionally have _ resonances _ corresponding to the boundary case @xmath108 , which exhibit somewhat similar behaviour . for simplicity of exposition",
    ", we will not discuss these ( important ) phenomena . ] to contain _ bound states _ ,",
    "in which @xmath102 is positive , and the distorted plane wave @xmath103 is replaced by an _",
    "@xmath99 , which continues to solve the equation , but now @xmath99 decays exponentially to zero as @xmath105 , instead of oscillating like a plane wave as before .",
    "( informally , this is because once @xmath102 is positive , the dispersion relation is forcing @xmath67 to be imaginary rather than real . ) in particular , @xmath99 lies in @xmath109 , and so @xmath110 becomes an eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator is related to the hamiltonian @xmath111 discussed earlier by the formula @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the usual inner product on @xmath109 . ]",
    "because multiplication @xmath16 is a compact operator relative to @xmath115 , standard spectral theory shows that the set of eigenvalues @xmath110 is discrete ( except possibly at the origin @xmath116 ) . note that it is necessary for @xmath16 to take on negative values in order to obtain negative eigenvalues , since otherwise the operator @xmath56 is positive semi - definite .",
    "if @xmath85 consists of a superposition of one or more of these eigenfunctions , e.g. @xmath117 where @xmath118 ranges over finitely many of the eigenvalues of @xmath56 , then we formally have @xmath119 and so we see that @xmath44 oscillates in time but does not disperse in space .",
    "in this case we say that @xmath54 is a _ bound state_. indeed , the evolution is instead _ almost periodic _ , in the sense that @xmath120 , or equivalently that the orbit @xmath121 is a precompact subset of @xmath109 .    by further application of spectral theory , one can show that an arbitrary state @xmath85 ( in , say , @xmath109 ) can be decomposed as the orthogonal sum of a radiating state , which disperses as @xmath95 , and a bound state , which evolves in an almost periodic manner .",
    "indeed this decomposition corresponds to the decomposition of the spectral measure of @xmath56 into absolutely continuous and pure point components .",
    "we have seen how solutions to linear dispersive equations either disperse completely as @xmath95 , or else ( in the presence of an external potential ) decompose into a superposition of a radiative state that disperses to zero , plus a bound state that exhibits phase oscillation but is otherwise stationary .    in everyday physical experience with water waves ,",
    "we of course see that such waves disperse to zero over time ; once a rock is thrown into a pond , for instance , the amplitude of the resulting waves diminish over time .",
    "however , one does see in nature water waves which refuse to disperse for astonishingly long periods of time , instead moving at a constant speed without change in shape .",
    "such _ solitary waves _ or _",
    "_ solitons _ _ were first observed by john scott russell , who followed such a wave in a shallow canal on horseback for over a mile , and then reproduced such a traveling wave ( which he called a `` wave of translation '' ) in a wave tank .",
    "this phenomenon was first explained mathematically by korteweg and de vries @xcite in 1895 , using the equation that now bears their name ( although this equation was first proposed as a model for shallow wave propagation by boussinesq a few decades earlier ) .",
    "indeed , if one considers traveling wave solutions to of the form @xmath122 for some velocity @xmath10 , then this will be a solution to as long as @xmath123 solves the ode @xmath124 if we assume that @xmath123 decays at infinity , then we can integrate this third - order ode to obtain a second - order ode @xmath125 for @xmath8 , this ode admits the localised explicit solutions @xmath126 for any @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the explicit schwartz function @xmath129 . for @xmath130 , one can show that there are no localised solutions other than the trivial solution @xmath131 .",
    "thus we obtain a family of explicit solitary wave solutions @xmath132 to the kdv equation ; the parameter @xmath10 thus controls the speed , amplitude , and width of the wave , while @xmath133 determines the initial location .",
    "interestingly , all the solutions move to the _ right _ , while radiating states move to the left .",
    "this phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the situation with the linear schrdinger equation , in which the temporal frequency @xmath102 ( which is somewhat like the propagation speed @xmath10 in kdv ) was negative for radiating states and positive for bound states .",
    "similar solitary wave solutions can also be found for gkdv and nls equations , though in higher dimensions @xmath134 one can not hope to obtain such explicit formulae for these solutions , and instead one needs to use more modern pde tools , such as calculus of variations and other elliptic theory methods , in order to build such solutions ; see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are also larger and more oscillatory `` excited '' solitary wave solutions which , unlike the `` ground state '' solitary wave solutions described above , exhibit changes of sign , but we will not discuss them here .    early numerical analyses of the kdv equation@xcite , @xcite revealed that these soliton solutions were remarkably stable .",
    "firstly , if one perturbed a soliton by adding a small amount of noise , then the noise would soon radiate away from the soliton , leaving the soliton largely unchanged ( other than some slight perturbation in the @xmath10 and @xmath133 parameters ) ; these phenomena are described mathematically by results on the _ orbital stability _ and _ asymptotic stability _ of solitons , of which more will be said later .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , given that solitons move rightwards and radiation moves leftwards , but one has to bear in mind that equations such as are not linear , and in particular one can not obviously superimpose a soliton and a radiative state to create a new solution to the kdv equation .",
    "what was even more surprising was what happened if one considered collisions between two solitons , for instance imagining initial data of the form @xmath135 with @xmath136 and @xmath137 far to the left of @xmath138 ; thus initially we have a larger , fast - moving soliton to the left of a shallower , slow - moving soliton .",
    "if the kdv equation were linear , the solution would now take the form @xmath139 and so the faster solitons would simply overtake the slower one , with no interaction between the two . at the other extreme , with a strongly nonlinear equation",
    ", one could imagine all sorts of scenarios when two solitons collide , for instance that they scatter into radiation or into many smaller solitons , combine into a large soliton , and so forth .",
    "however , the kdv equation exhibits an interesting intermediate behaviour : the solitons do interact nonlinearly with each other during collision , but then emerge from that collision almost unchanged , except that the solitons have been shifted slightly by their collision . in other words , for very late times",
    "@xmath43 , the solution approximately takes the form @xmath140 for some additional shift parameters @xmath141 .",
    "more generally , if one starts with _ arbitrary _ ( but smooth and decaying ) initial data , what usually happens ( numerically , at least ) with evolutions of equations such as is that some non - linear ( and chaotic - seeming ) behaviour happens for a while , but eventually most of the solution radiates away to infinity and a finite number of solitons emerge , moving away from each other at different rates .",
    "quite remarkably , this behaviour can in fact be justified rigorously for the kdv equation and a handful of other equations ( such as the nls equation in the cubic one - dimensional case @xmath142 ) due to the inverse scattering method , which we shall discuss shortly , although even in those cases , there are some exotic solutions , such as `` breather '' solutions , which occasionally arise and which do not evolve to a superposition of solitons and radiation , but instead exhibit periodic or almost periodic behaviour in time .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely believed ( and supported by extensive numerics ) that for many other dispersive equations ( roughly speaking , those equations whose nonlinearity is not strong enough to cause finite time blowup , and more precisely for the _ subcritical _ equations ) , solutions with `` generic '' initial data should eventually resolve into a finite number of solitons , moving at different speeds , plus a radiative term which goes to zero .",
    "this ( rather vaguely defined ) conjecture goes by the name of the _ soliton resolution conjecture_. except for those few equations which admit exact solutions ( for instance , by inverse scattering methods ) , the conjecture remains unsolved in general , in part because we have very few tools available that can say anything meaningful about _ generic _ data in a certain class ( e.g. with some function norm bounds ) without also being applicable to _ all _ data in that class ; thus the presence of a few exotic solutions that do not resolve into solitons and radiation seems to prevent us from tackling all the other cases .",
    "nevertheless , there are certain important regimes in which we do have a good understanding .",
    "one of these is the perturbative regime near a single soliton , in which the initial state @xmath85 is close to that of a soliton such as ; this case will be the main topic of our discussion .",
    "more recently , results have begun to emerge on _ multisoliton _ states , in which the solution is close to the superposition of many widely separated solitons , and even more recently still , there has been some results on the collision between a very fast narrow soliton and a very slow broad one .",
    "however , it seems that truly non - perturbative regimes , such as the collisions between two solitons of comparable size , remain beyond the reach of current tools ( perhaps requiring a new advance in our understanding of dynamical systems in general ) .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further discussion . )",
    "we now briefly mention the technique of _ inverse scattering _ , which is a non - perturbative approach which allows one to control the evolution of solutions to completely integrable equations such as .",
    "( similar techniques apply to one - dimensional cubic nls , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "this is a vast subject , which can be viewed from many different algebraic and geometric perspectives ; we shall content ourselves with describing the approach based on _ lax pairs _",
    "@xcite , which has the advantage of simplicity , provided that one is willing to accept a rather miraculous algebraic identity .",
    "the identity in question is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 solves the kdv equation .",
    "as always we assume enough smoothness and decay to justify the computations that follow . for every time @xmath43 , we consider the time - dependent differential operators @xmath143 , @xmath144 acting on functions on the real line @xmath145 , defined by @xmath146 where we view @xmath44 as a multiplication operator , @xmath147 .",
    "one can view @xmath144 as a truncated ( non - commutative ) taylor expansion of @xmath148 . in view with this interpretation ,",
    "it is perhaps not so surprising that @xmath143 and @xmath144 `` almost commute '' ; the commutator @xmath149 : = p(t ) l(t ) - l(t ) p(t)$ ] of the third order operator @xmath144 and the second order operator @xmath143 would normally be expected to be fourth order , but in fact things collapse to just be zeroth order . indeed , after some computation , one eventually obtains @xmath150 = \\frac{1}{4 } ( u_{xxx}(t ) + 6 u(t ) u_x(t ) ) .\\ ] ] in particular , if we substitute in , we obtain the remarkable _ lax pair equation _ @xmath151.\\ ] ] if we non - rigorously treat the operators @xmath143 , @xmath144 as if they were matrices , we can interpret this equation as follows . using the newton approximation @xmath152 for infinitesimal @xmath153 , we see from that @xmath154 this informal analysis suggests that @xmath155 is a conjugate of @xmath143 , and so on iterating this we expect @xmath143 to be a conjugate of @xmath156 .",
    "in particular , the _ spectrum _ of @xmath143 should be time - invariant .",
    "since @xmath143 is determined by @xmath44 , this leads to a rich source of invariants for @xmath44 .",
    "the above analysis can be made more rigorous .",
    "for instance , one can show that the traces . ]",
    "@xmath157 of heat kernels are independent of @xmath43 for any fixed @xmath158 ; expanding those traces in powers of @xmath159 one can recover an infinite number of conservation laws , which includes the conservation of the hamiltonian as a special case .",
    "we will not pursue this approach further here , and refer the reader to @xcite . another way to proceed",
    "is to consider solutions to the generalised eigenfunction equation @xmath160 for some @xmath62 and some smooth function @xmath161 ( not necessarily decaying at infinity ) . if the equation holds for a single time @xmath43 ( e.g. @xmath34 ) , and if @xmath162 then evolves by the equation @xmath163 for all @xmath43 , one can verify ( formally , at least ) that persists for all @xmath43 , by differentiating in time and substituting in and .",

    "the relationship of all this to solitons is as follows .",
    "recall from our discussion of the linear schrdinger equation that the operator @xmath187 is going to have radiating states ( or absolutely continuous spectrum ) corresponding to negative energies @xmath188 , and a discrete set of positive eigenfunctions corresponding to positive energies @xmath189 .",
    "generically , the eigenvalues are simple . in that case",
    ", it turns out that the inverse scattering procedure relates each eigenvalue @xmath190 of @xmath156 to a soliton present inside @xmath85 ; the value of @xmath67 determines the scaling parameter @xmath10 of the soliton , and the scattering data @xmath186 determines ( in a slightly complicated fashion , depending on the rest of the spectrum ) the location of the solitons .",
    "the remaining scattering data @xmath184 , @xmath185 determines the radiative portion of the solution .",
    "as the solution evolves , the spectrum stays constant , but the data @xmath191 changes in a controlled manner ; this is what causes the solitons to move and the radiation to scatter .",
    "it turns out that the exact location of each soliton depends to some extent on the relative sizes of the constants @xmath192 , which are growing or decaying exponentially at differing rates ; it is because of this that as one soliton overtakes another , the location of each soliton gets shifted slightly .",
    "the inverse scattering method gives extremely powerful and precise information on very general ( and in particular , non - perturbative ) solutions to equations such as the korteweg - de vries equation .",
    "however , it does not seem to be directly applicable to more general equations , such as the gkdv equation for turns out to also be completely integrable ; in fact , it can even be transformed directly into the kdv equation by a simple operation known as the _ _",
    "miura transform__@xcite , which we will not discuss further here . ] @xmath193 .",
    "for instance , no reasonable lax pair formulation exists for these equations .",
    "we now turn to more analytic techniques , which are less sensitive to the fine algebraic structure of the equation , although they still do rely very heavily on conservation laws and their relatives , such as monotonicity formulae .",
    "we shall mostly restrict attention to the gkdv equation .",
    "we have already identified one conserved quantity for this equation , namely the energy .",
    "another such conserved quantity is the mass @xmath194 together , the mass and energy can ( in some cases ) control the @xmath195 norm @xmath196 indeed , if we are in the _ mass - subcritical _ case @xmath197 , then the _ gagliardo - nirenberg inequality _",
    "@xmath198 valid for any @xmath42 with suitable decay and regularity , gives us the _ a priori _ bound @xmath199 for some quantity @xmath200 depending on the initial mass or energy .",
    "the condition @xmath201 is necessary to ensure that the exponent @xmath202 in is strictly less than @xmath9 .",
    "this condition can also be deduced from scaling heuristics , by investigating how the mass and energy transform under the scale invariance @xmath203    it is possible to use the _ a priori _ bound , combined with the picard iteration method for constructing solutions , and some moderately advanced estimates from harmonic analysis , to show that the equation in the mass - subcritical case admits a unique global smooth solutions from arbitrary smooth , decaying data ; see @xcite .",
    "thus there is no problem with existence , uniqueness , or regularity when it comes to these equations ; the only remaining analytic issue ( albeit a difficult one ) is to understand the asymptotic behaviour of solutions .",
    "the above analysis for @xmath197 is valid no matter how large the mass @xmath204 of the solution is .",
    "if we then turn to the _ mass - critical _ case @xmath31 , the situation changes ; the _ a priori _ bound is now only valid when the mass @xmath205 is sufficiently small .",
    "in fact , by using the sharp gagliardo - nirenberg inequality of weinstein@xcite , one can be more precise as follows . given any @xmath18 , the equation admits a family of soliton ( or solitary wave ) solutions similar to , namely @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a positive , smooth , rapidly decreasing solution to the ode @xmath208 ( in fact , up to translation , @xmath128 is the only such solution ; see @xcite , @xcite . ) in particular , we have the _ standard soliton _",
    "solution to gkdv @xmath209 all other solitons differ from the standard soliton only by the scaling and the translation invariance .    in the mass - critical case @xmath31 ,",
    "all of the solitons have the same mass , namely @xmath210 the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality of weinstein can then be used to show that one has the a priori bound in the @xmath31 case as long as one only considers solutions with mass strictly less than that of the ground state , and so long as the solution exists ; see @xcite .",
    "the latter caveat is a substantial one ; it is conjectured that one has global existence of solutions for gkdv of the @xmath31 from smooth decaying initial data whenever the mass is less than that of the ground state , but this conjecture is still open .",

    "@xmath211 the situation is very unclear , due to the lack of good _ a priori _ etimates in this case ; it is likely that singularities do form in this case for large initial data , but this has not been rigorously established .",
    "it is however known that solitons are unstable in this setting .",
    "we return now to the mass - subcritical case @xmath201 , in which global existence and regularity are assured , and now consider the problem of _ stability _ of one of the soliton solutions . by taking advantage of the scaling and translation invariance in the problem , we can reduce matters to considering the stability of the standard soliton @xmath212 .",
    "for instance , if we are given a solution @xmath54 which is close to this soliton at time zero , for instance in the sense that @xmath213 for some sufficiently small @xmath214 , is this enough to guarantee that @xmath54 stays close to for much later times , thus @xmath215 for some other small @xmath216 depending on @xmath214 , and for large times @xmath43 ?",

    "one can phrase this question in other norms than the @xmath195 norm , of course , but this norm turns out to be rather natural due to its connection with the hamiltonian ( which we have already seen in ) .",
    "this type of _ absolute stability _ of the soliton is too strong a property to hold , basically because it is not compatible with the scale invariance .",
    "indeed , consider the soliton solution with @xmath220 and @xmath221 very close to @xmath9",
    ". then holds , but will fail for sufficiently large times @xmath43 , because @xmath54 has most of its mass ( and @xmath195 norm ) near @xmath222 , whereas has most of its mass near @xmath222 .",
    "the point is that by rescaling the soliton very slightly , one can adjust the speed of that soliton , which will eventually over time cause the perturbed soliton to diverge from the original soliton . note",
    "that this conclusion has nothing to do with the @xmath195 norm , and would work for basically any reasonable function space norm .",
    "however , even though this perturbed soliton is far from the original soliton at late times @xmath43 , it is still close to a _ translation _ of that original soliton ( by @xmath223 ) .",

    "we already saw , though , that @xmath128 is not absolutely stable , and so such a lyapunov functional can not exist .",
    "however , we can still hope to obtain a modified lyapunov functional @xmath240 which implies orbital stability instead of absolute stability .",
    "more precisely , we require @xmath242 to be such that    1 .",

    "the one drawback of the method is that , by being indirect and relying so strongly on compactness methods , it does not easily provide any sort of quantitative bound in its conclusions , in contrast to the previous arguments used to prove theorem [ asymt ] , which were direct and easily provide explicit bounds .",
    "let us now sketch how this method is applied to give a new proof of theorem [ asymt ] .",
    "actually we will just prove the slightly weaker claim that the translated radiation terms @xmath339 converges weakly in @xmath340 to zero as @xmath291 ; note this weak convergence implies for instance that @xmath341 converges locally uniformly to zero , and so the radiation term eventually vacates the neighbourhood of the soliton .",
    "one can upgrade this convergence to obtain results closer in strength in theorem [ asymt ] , but we will not do so here .    to prove this weak convergence claim , we use the compactness - and - contradiction method .",
    "suppose for contradiction that @xmath339 does not converge weakly to @xmath340 as @xmath291 .",
    "since @xmath264 is bounded in @xmath195 , weak compactness then shows that there exists a sequence of times @xmath342 such that @xmath343 converges weakly in @xmath195 to some non - trivial limit @xmath344 ; one can also assume that @xmath345 converges to some limit @xmath293 .",
    "due to some weak continuity properties of the gkdv flow ( which can be proven by harmonic analysis methods ) one can then show that @xmath346 converges weakly ( and locally in time ) to some limiting solution @xmath347 , where @xmath348 and @xmath349 obey similar estimates to @xmath279 and @xmath264 , and @xmath348 is defined using some modulation parameters @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "the normalised radiation terms @xmath352 stay bounded in @xmath195 . by the rellich compactness theorem , this means that they are locally precompact in @xmath353 , i.e. their restriction to any compact spatial interval @xmath354 lies in a compact subset of @xmath355 .",
    "we now assert that these terms are in fact _ globally _ precompact in @xmath353 . this is equivalent to asserting that for any @xmath356 , we must have some radius @xmath279 such that we have very little mass on the left , @xmath357 and very little mass on the right @xmath358    we briefly sketch why one would expect these claims to be true .",
    "suppose that failed , then a non - zero portion of the mass of @xmath349 at some time would be far to the right of the soliton . returning to the original solution , we see that there exist arbitrarily large times @xmath43 for which a significant portion of the mass of @xmath359 is to the right of @xmath273 .",
    "now we evolve backwards in time , back to time @xmath312 . away from the soliton",
    ", mass has a tendency to move leftwards as one goes forwards in time , and thus rightwards as one goes backwards in time .",
    "one can make this precise ( by using crude forms of the local virial identity alluded to before ) , and conclude that at time @xmath312 , a significant portion of the mass of @xmath360 is to the right of @xmath273 . but @xmath43 can be arbitrarily large , and so @xmath273 can be arbitrarily large also ( recall that @xmath309 stays close to @xmath9 ) .",
    "this contradicts the monotone convergence theorem , and so .",
    "the proof of is similar ; if failed , then at some point a non - zero portion of the mass of @xmath349 lies far to the left of the soliton , and thus we have strictly less than @xmath361 of the mass of @xmath349 near or to the right of the soliton . by the above discussion",
    ", we see that we have strictly less than @xmath361 of the mass of @xmath359 near or to the right of @xmath273 for a sequence of arbitrarily large times @xmath43 .",
    "but by using local virial - type identities to control the propagation of mass , this loss of mass to the left is irreversible , and in fact we have strictly less than @xmath361 of the mass of @xmath359 near or to the right of @xmath273 for _ all _ sufficiently large times @xmath43 .",
    "but then it is not possible for @xmath362 to converge weakly to @xmath363 , a contradiction .",
    "it turns out that one can upgrade the bounds , significantly , to obtain a pointwise uniform exponential decay estimate of the form @xmath364 for some @xmath8 .",
    "this is established by a long - time analysis of and exploits the fact that the fundamental solution to the airy equation decays exponentially fast in the rightwards direction .",
    "this uniformity estimate is crucial in what follows .",
    "it then remains to establish the _ liouville theorem _ that if @xmath349 is a sufficiently small ( in @xmath195 ) solution to a nonlinear equation with @xmath365 compact in @xmath353 , then @xmath349 must vanish . to prove this",
    ", we first use another compactness - and - contradiction argument in order to eliminate the nonlinear terms in .",
    "if the claim failed , then we could find a sequence of solutions @xmath366 to which converged to zero in @xmath195 norm as @xmath367 , and were each compact in @xmath353 , but were non - zero . normalising each @xmath366 by its @xmath195 norm , we see from from the uniform estimate that the resulting sequence is still compact in @xmath353 .",
    "thus we can take a limit and obtain a nontrivial solution @xmath264 to the _ linearised _ equation @xmath368 for some scalar quantity @xmath369 , which stays compact in @xmath353 and bounded in @xmath195 ( and obeys the orthogonality conditions ) .",
    "the task is thus to show that there is no such solution other than the trivial solution @xmath370 , which will establish the liouville theorem and thus theorem [ asymt ] .    at this point",
    ", one can now use the global virial estimate , which is valid here due to the exponential decay of @xmath264 .",
    "if @xmath264 is non - trivial , it has an @xmath195 norm bounded away from zero , which in conjunction with the @xmath353 compactness shows that the right - hand side of is negative and bounded away from zero . but this forces @xmath371 to go to @xmath372 , which contradicts the exponential decay of @xmath264 .",
    "this finally finishes the argument .",
    "( an alternate proof of this `` linear liouville theorem '' was also recently established in @xcite . )",
    "we conclude with a number of miscellaneous remarks .",
    "this proof was significantly more complicated than the direct proof , but the underlying strategy is much more powerful : it uses compactness methods to strip away all the inessential portions of the dynamics , leaving a very smooth and localised solution to which global estimates can be applied .",
    "this dispenses with the need for any cutoffs in space or frequency , which can significantly complicate the analysis .",
    "these arguments have recently been simplified and generalised further ( to handle arbitrary power - type nonlinearities ) in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this result does not require any spectral hypotheses on the linearised problem .",
    "also , some sharper asymptotics for special nonlinearities ( in particular the @xmath294 case ) have been obtained in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the above arguments crucially rely on the tendency of gkdv evolutions to propagate non - soliton mass in one direction , while the soliton itself moves in another direction , leading to some crucial monotonicity formulae .",
    "these methods can be extended to some other models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for nls models however , there are only weak analogues of these formulae ( see @xcite ) , although for some special nonlinearities ( in which spectral hypotheses on the linearised operator are assumed ) asymptotic stability for such equations can be recovered @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the situation is particularly well understood in the radial case , in which the soliton remains tied to the spatial origin and so the degeneracies in stability associated with translation invariance are eliminated . for a survey of these issues",
    "see @xcite .    in a sort of converse to asymptotic stability ( analogous to the existence of wave operators in scattering theory )",
    ", it is also possible to construct solutions with prescribed asymptotic behaviour of the type described above ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the more difficult mass - critical case @xmath31 , in which the scale invariance now plays a much more delicate role .",
    "the details are rather technical and we shall only paraphrase or sketch the key arguments here , referring the reader to the original papers for full details . for further surveys of the results in this section ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the new difficulty in the critical case can be seen by considering the one - parameter family of soliton states @xmath373 .",
    "a short computation shows that @xmath374 and @xmath375 . if @xmath376 , the exponents here are non - zero ( and @xmath377 and @xmath378 are also non - zero ) , and so the conservation of mass or energy prohibits a solution which starts near @xmath128 from ending up near @xmath379 for any @xmath380 .",
    "but in the critical case @xmath31 , we have @xmath381 , while one can compute that @xmath382 .",
    "thus , the mass and energy conservation laws do not prohibit the possibility of drift from @xmath128 to @xmath379 , or more generally along the entire ground state surface , on which the mass is always @xmath377 and the energy is always @xmath312 .",
    "indeed , numerics @xcite suggest that solutions @xmath54 starting near a ground state will increase their scale parameter @xmath10 to infinity in finite time , thus leading to finite time blowup ( thus , for instance @xmath383 for some finite time @xmath384 ) .",
    "an inspection of the linearised operator also supports the possibility of drift to increasingly finer scales .",
    "henceforth we fix @xmath31 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the sharp gagliardo - nirenberg inequality of weinstein@xcite allows one to show that no blowup occurs as long as @xmath385 , in particular there are initial data arbitrarily close to the ground state for which one has global existence .",
    "a refinement of this analysis also allows one to consider the situation was subsequently treated in @xcite , in which blowup was shown to be impossible . ] in which @xmath386 for some small @xmath387 , as long as the energy @xmath388 is _ negative _",
    "( this situation can again occur arbitrarily close to the ground state @xmath128 , as long as the mass is strictly greater than @xmath377 ) . in this case , we can again ( up to a harmless change of sign , @xmath389 ) obtain a decomposition of the form over the lifespan of the solution . however , a key difference in the critical case is that the scale parameter @xmath302 can go to infinity in finite time .",
    "henceforth we assume @xmath386 for sufficiently small @xmath390 , and also @xmath391",
    ". it will be convenient to make the error @xmath264 dimensionless ( i.e. invariant under the scaling symmetry ) by replacing with the equivalent decomposition @xmath392.\\ ] ] as before , one can select two orthogonality conditions on @xmath264 ; it turns out to be convenient to require @xmath393 .",
    "in that case one can use weinstein s analysis to show ( after replacing @xmath54 with @xmath394 if necessary ) that @xmath359 is small in @xmath195 ( see e.g. @xcite for details is used rather than the scale parameter @xmath302 , but this of course makes only a minor notational difference to the argument . ] ) .",
    "in particular we see that @xmath395 , and so blowup in the @xmath195 norm is equivalent to @xmath302 going to infinity .",
    "suppose for the moment that the solution @xmath54 existed globally in time , with @xmath302 bounded both above and below , and furthermore that @xmath359 ranged in a compact subset of @xmath353 ( so in particular , one has bounds such as , ) .",
    "then the same liouville theorem analysis used in the subcritical case can be used to show that @xmath370 , which would of course contradict the assumption that @xmath254 is strictly greater than @xmath377 ; see @xcite for details . by repeating the rest of the subcritical analysis ,",
    "this is already enough to deduce asymptotic stability in the case when @xmath302 is bounded both above and below .",
    "however , this statement is vacuous due to the results in @xcite , which in fact show that @xmath396 as @xmath397 , where @xmath398 is the maximal time of existence .",
    "we sketch the proof of this result as follows .",
    "once again we use a compactness and contradiction argument .",
    "if the above claim failed , then one could find a sequence @xmath399 of solutions , each with some finite or infinite lifespan @xmath400 , with mass @xmath401 and @xmath402 , such that the velocity function @xmath403 stayed bounded in @xmath43 for each @xmath404 ( though with a bound depending on @xmath404 ) .",
    "for each @xmath404 , we consider the quantity @xmath405 .",
    "then @xmath406 is bounded ; from the negative conserved energy one can also show @xmath406 to be non - zero . thus we can find a time @xmath331 for each @xmath404 such that @xmath407 is very close to @xmath406 , and that @xmath403 is either close to or larger than @xmath406 for all @xmath408 . by rescaling and translating in time",
    "if necessary we may take @xmath409 and @xmath410 .    for each @xmath404 , we see from construction that @xmath403 is always greater than or close to @xmath9 , and returns for some infinite sequence of times @xmath411 to be close to @xmath9 .",
    "this situation is similar to the previous situation `` @xmath403 bounded above and below '' , except that we now allow @xmath412 to oscillate between being close to @xmath9 and being extremely large .",
    "it turns out that with enough care , one can use local mass propagation estimates much as before to obtain exponential decay similar to at and near the times @xmath413 , or more precisely for a limiting error profile @xmath414 obtained as a weak limit of @xmath415 .",
    "in particular , this places the limiting error profile @xmath414 ( and thus the limiting solution profile @xmath416 ) in @xmath417 .",
    "this allows one to deploy a final conservation law , namely the mean @xmath418 .",
    "the conservation of this quantity can be used to show that the limiting velocity parameter @xmath350 is bounded both above and below , at which point the liouville theorem ensures tht @xmath414 must vanish .",
    "but this turns out to be incompatible with the negative energy hypothesis .",
    "this contradiction establishes the desired claim that one has blowup either at finite or at infinite times .",
    "it turns out that one can analyse these solutions further . for this",
    "it turns out to be convenient to change the orthogonality conditions slightly , so that one now requires @xmath419 where @xmath420 denotes the spatial variable .",
    "( the expression @xmath421 can be viewed as the infinitesimal scaling vector field at @xmath128 . )",
    "these conditions are convenient for applying virial identities .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce a dimensionless time variable @xmath159 defined by the ode @xmath422 one can show that regardless of whether @xmath384 is finite or infinite , that @xmath423 as @xmath397 .",
    "the reason for these choices of coordinates is that the error @xmath424 now obeys an analytically tractable pde , which takes the form @xmath425 where @xmath242 is the linear operator @xmath426 and @xmath427 is a nonlinear ( and slightly non - local ) expression which consists of terms which are quadratic and higher in @xmath264 , and which are largely localised in space ( due to the fact that most terms involve at least one factor of the localised function @xmath128 ) .",
    "the finer structure of @xmath427 is important for certain computations , but for simplicity we will not delve into the explicit form of @xmath427 here .    if @xmath10 is now viewed as a function of @xmath159 rather than @xmath43 , then from the preceding analysis we have @xmath428 as @xmath429 .",
    "however , this divergence to infinity could potentially be quite oscillatory ; there is no _ a priori _ reason why @xmath430 should be monotone .",
    "also we do not have _ a priori _ knowledge as to the rate of growth of @xmath10 in @xmath159 .",
    "suppose however that we had a time interval @xmath431 $ ] ( which could potentially be very long ) in which @xmath430 varies between @xmath432 and @xmath433 ( say ) , thus there is a slight focusing effect along this interval .",
    "suppose also that @xmath434 for all times @xmath435 , and also that we have an exponential localisation such as on the time interval @xmath431 $ ] ( actually , for this argument , we only need exponential localisation to the left of the soliton ) .",
    "it turns out that there is no solution of this form ( assuming our hypotheses of negative energy , and mass close to that of the ground state , of course ) .",
    "this key fact is established in @xcite , and we sketch the proof as follows .",
    "we may rescale so that @xmath436 , thus @xmath437 for @xmath438 $ ] . the localisation places @xmath264 in @xmath417 ( to the left , at least ) .",
    "we introduce a quantity @xmath439 that measures the amount of @xmath417 mass of @xmath264 that is to the left of the soliton ; the precise definition of @xmath439 is @xmath440 it turns out that @xmath439 obeys a differential equation of the form @xmath441 which reflects the fundamental fact that the non - soliton portion of mass tends to propagate to the left . on the other hand ,",
    "the conservation of mass and energy eventually gives us a lower bound @xmath442 and so on the interval @xmath431 $ ] ( where @xmath10 lies between @xmath9 and @xmath443 ) we have @xmath444 ( say ) . on the other hand , on @xmath431 $ ] the quantity @xmath10 increases from @xmath9 to @xmath443 , which together with tells us that @xmath445 increases over this interval by at least some absolute constant @xmath356 ( recall from that @xmath264 is small in @xmath417 ) .",
    "thus if we integrate over @xmath431 $ ] we arrive at a bound of the form @xmath446 on the other hand , virial identity arguments ( similar to those used to derive ) combined with the hypothesis that @xmath430 is comparable to @xmath9 on @xmath431 $ ] , allow us to establish a bound of the form @xmath447 where @xmath448 . for @xmath390",
    "sufficiently small , this leads to the desired contradiction .    by combining the above result with the liouville theorem discussed earlier , and another compactness - and - contradiction argument , it was shown in @xcite that there existed a sequence of times @xmath449 such that @xmath450 converged weakly ( in @xmath195 ) to zero . indeed , since we know @xmath428 as @xmath429 and is continuous in @xmath159 , we can define @xmath451 to be the last time for which @xmath452 . if @xmath450 did not converge weakly to zero , then ( after passing to a subsequence if necessary ) it would converge to some other limiting error profile @xmath453 , which can be viewed as the error at time zero for some limit solution profile @xmath454 , with its attendant velocity parameter @xmath455 , which is bounded from below by @xmath456 for all @xmath457 by construction .",
    "a careful application of local mass propagation inequalities ( see @xcite for details ) allows one to establish exponential decay on @xmath458 on the left .",
    "if @xmath455 increases to @xmath459 in finite time , one can then use the previous argument to obtain a contradiction .",
    "if instead @xmath455 ranged between @xmath456 and @xmath459 for all @xmath159 , then one can use further local mass propagation to get some decay on the right as well . the liouville theorem",
    "then would force @xmath349 to vanish , again leading to a contradiction .",
    "thus we obtain the weak convergence of @xmath450 to @xmath312 as claimed .",
    "a further compactness - and - contradiction argument in @xcite allows one to strengthen this claim , to assert that @xmath460 converges weakly to @xmath312 for _ all _ times @xmath429 , not just a subsequence @xmath449 of times . for",

    "but because any sufficiently large @xmath465 can be placed between a pair @xmath466 of times where @xmath264 is close to zero ( in the weak topology ) , it is possible to use local mass conservation to show that @xmath467 ; meanwhile , the energy @xmath468 can be shown by limiting arguments to be non - positive . but this , together with the orthogonality conditions on @xmath469 , forces @xmath469 to vanish , a contradiction .    finally , in @xcite , it was shown that solutions of the above form in fact blow up in finite time ( thus giving theoretical confirmation of the numerical blowups observed for instance in @xcite ) , provided that one make an additional assumption of decay on the right ( e.g. it would suffice to have @xmath470 for some @xmath356 ) .",
    "we very briefly sketch the main ideas as follows . in view of the relation",
    ", some numerology shows that finite time blowup will eventuate if we can show that @xmath471 grows ( on average at least ) like @xmath472 for some @xmath356 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown that @xmath473 `` on the average '' , for some absolute constant @xmath356 , which leads to finite time blowup for negative energy data .",
    "a calculation of the dynamics of @xmath430 reveals an equation of the form @xmath474 the error term here is controllable by virial identities .",
    "but the quantity @xmath475 is somewhat oscillatory and is not easy to control directly . to avoid this problem ,",

    "fortunately , the hypothesis of polynomial decay on the right at time zero , together with some local mass propagation estimates , turn out to give enough decay to make this decomposition viable ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also have an associated rescaled time variable @xmath480 defined by @xmath481 .",
    "the point of performing this decomposition is that the equation for @xmath482 is simpler than that for @xmath430 : @xmath483 furthermore , one can show that @xmath10 and @xmath484 are comparable , as are @xmath264 and @xmath477 , in various technical senses . in particular , the quantities @xmath485 and @xmath486 can be related to each other modulo acceptable errors . on the other hand ,",
    "mass and energy conservation considerations eventually let one establish a lower bound on @xmath486 of the form @xmath487 , modulo acceptable error terms .",
    "the claim follows .",
    "the above analysis in fact gives some more explicit upper and lower bounds on the blowup rate ( i.e. the behaviour of @xmath302 as @xmath43 approaches @xmath384 ) ; see @xcite for details .",
    "for the analogous problem for mass - critical nls , blowup from negative energy data can be obtained easily from a virial identity argument , at least when the data is localised in space ; see @xcite , while explicit blowup solutions can also be constructed via the pseudo - conformal symmetry of this equation .",
    "however , the corresponding virial identities for gkdv equation , while leading to important estimates such as , seem to be unable to coerce blowup just by themselves .    the situation for the supercritical equation @xmath488 is still poorly understood ; due to some crucial changes of sign , many of the methods used above fail completely .",
    "numerics such as those in @xcite continue to suggest finite time blowup starting near soliton initial data in this case , but the dynamics are known to be unstable @xcite and so it is unlikely that a controlled blowup of the type seen above will hold , at least for generic data .",
    "we now briefly survey more recent developments regarding stability of multisolitons , and on collisions between solitons . due to the vast explosion in activity in these areas ( for a wide variety of dispersive models )",
    ", we will not be able to give a comprehensive bibliography here , instead focusing on a representative subset of results .",
    "there has been some progress in understanding the stability aspects for _ multisolitons _ - superpositions of two or more solitons . as the underlying equations are non - linear , constructing these solutions is non - trivial , and indeed existence of such solutions is usually established simultaneously with stability results . when the solitons are far apart and receding from each other , one is in a perturbative regime and can in some cases glue together the stability theory for single solitons to create multisolitons .",
    "see @xcite for an instance of this for subcritical gkdv multisolitons , and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some results for subcritical nls multisolitons .",
    "more difficult is the question of what happens when two solitons collide .",
    "recently there has been some work on the collision between fast thin solitons and slow broad solitons @xcite , @xcite ; the situation is still perturbative , but there are noticeable nonlinear effects , such as a shift in position in the fast soliton caused by nonlinear interaction with the slow soliton . somewhat similarly in spirit , there has been some recent work in @xcite , @xcite investigating the collision between a fast soliton and a localised potential ( such as a delta function potential ) .",
    "the fully non - perturbative situation of two large slow solitons colliding is however still beyond current technology .    in supercritical cases ,",
    "solitons are generally unstable .",
    "however in some cases the number of unstable directions is finite , and so finite dimensional stable manifolds can ( in principle ) be constructed .",
    "this turns out to be a rather delicate issue ( relying , among other things , on strong control on the spectrum of the linearised operator , which can contain some non - trivial resonances ) ; see @xcite , @xcite for recent developments .",
    "there has also been many recent papers on the blowup in the neighbourhood of a soliton to a scale - invariant evolution equation ; these results do not quite follow exactly the same pattern as the results for critical gkdv mentioned in the previous section , but certainly share many of the same ingredients .",
    "for instance , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some results relating to the mass - critical nls . for the energy - critical non - linear wave equation or wave maps equation , there are some slightly different approaches to create blowup @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent survey .    the compactness - and - contradiction approach has also been applied to derive the _ absence _ of blowup ( i.e. global existence ) for critical equations in the _ defocusing _ case , or in focusing cases in which the solution is `` smaller '' in mass or energy than that of the ground state .",

    "<S> the theory of linear dispersive equations predicts that waves should spread out and disperse over time . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is a remarkable phenomenon , observed both in theory and practice , that once nonlinear effects are taken into account , _ solitary wave _ or _ soliton _ </S>",
    "<S> solutions can be created , which can be stable enough to persist indefinitely . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of such solutions can be relatively straightforward , but the fact that they are _ stable _ requires some significant amounts of analysis to establish , in part due to symmetries in the equation ( such as translation invariance ) which create degeneracy in the stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is particularly difficult in the _ critical _ case in which the nonlinearity is at exactly the right power to potentially allow for a self - similar blowup . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we survey some of the highlights of this theory , from the more classical orbital stability analysis of weinstein and grillakis - shatah - strauss , to the more recent asymptotic stability and blowup analysis of martel - merle and merle - raphael , as well as current developments in using this theory to rigorously demonstrate controlled blowup for several key equations . </S>"
