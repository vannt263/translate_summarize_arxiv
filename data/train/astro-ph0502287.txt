    "circumstellar disks surrounding t tauri and herbig ae / be stars are thought to the birth sites of planetary systems and they are called protoplanetary disks . the physical properties of the protoplanetary disks have been inferred from analyses of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "analyses of observations at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths suggest that the disks have masses of 0.001 - 0.1 @xmath8 and their life time is @xmath9yr ( e.g. , strom et al .",
    "1989 ; beckwith et al .  1990 ; wyatt et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "recent observations with high - resolution at various wavelengths gave us much information on disk spatial structure ( e.g. , grady et al .",
    "1999 ; fukagawa et al .",
    "2004 ; mundy et al .",
    "1996 ; kitamura et al . 2002 ; eisner et al . 2003 ) .",
    "for example , kitamura et al .  (",
    "2002 ) derived disk outer radii and surface density distributions from results of their image survey of 13 t tauri disks and sed data .",
    "their results show that the radial power - law index of the surface density @xmath10 ranges from 0 to -1 , which is less steep than -1.5 in the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) ( hayashi 1981 ) . because the obtained surface densities at 100 au is almost consistent with the mmsn , the small radial power - law index of @xmath1 means too small surface density at @xmath11au for planet formation in those disks .    in the most analyses of disk observations including kitamura et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , dust growth have not been taken into account .",
    "however , the grain growth is indicated by the variety of silicate feature at 10@xmath12 m observed in t tauri disks ( przygodda et al .",
    "2003 ; honda et al .",
    "2003 ; meeus et al .",
    ". dust growth usually decreases the opacity and the optical thickness of disks .",
    "if grains grow considerably in the observed disks , the estimated disk mass mentioned above would be underestimated ( dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ; natta et al .",
    "2004 ) . furthermore ,",
    "dust growth is generally fast in the inner disk region compared with the outer region ( weidenschilling 1980 ; nakagawa et al .",
    "rapid decrease in the optical thickness in the inner region would make the radial distribution of the optical thickness less steep than that of the surface density .",
    "the rapid dust growth in inner regions may also be responsible to inner holes identified by calvet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in tw hydra and by bouwman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in hd1000546 .",
    "furthermore , the spitzer space telescope started to provide lots of new data on disk inner holes ( forrest at al .",
    "2004 ; meyer et al . 2004",
    "; uchida et al . 2004 ) .",
    "hence , dust growth should be taken into account in the analyses of disk observations .",
    "recent models of protoplanetary disks succeeded in accounting for most properties in the observed seds ( e.g. , chiang & goldreich 1997 ; chiang et al . 2001 ; dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ; dullemond et al .",
    "2001 ; dullemond & dominik 2004a ) .",
    "although they also examined the effect of dust growth , they a priori adopted a single power - law size distribution for a whole disk and assumed that the grain number at each size is proportional to the gas density .",
    "however , the size distribution would be considerably different at each position because of a large variety of the growth time in a whole disk , as mentioned above . furthermore",
    ", dust settling would change the vertical distribution of dust grain in disks .",
    "dullemond & dominik ( 2004b ) showed the importance of dust settling at the self - shadowing process in passive disks . to derive information correctly from observations , the more realistic model of dust growth and settling",
    "should be used .    dust growth and settling in protoplanetary disks",
    "have been investigated by many authors for both laminar disks ( e.g. , safronov 1969 ; weidenschilling 1980 , 1997 ; nakagawa et al .  1981 , 1986 ) and turbulent disks ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1984 ; mizuno et al .  1988 ; schmitt et al .",
    "1997 ) . in laminar disks or those with sufficiently weak turbulence ,",
    "dust grains grow to mm - size when they settle to the mid - plane of the gaseous disk . as a result of dust settling",
    ", a dust - rich layer is formed near the mid - plane . in the dust layer , a large number of planetesimals are thought to form as the first step of planetary formation ( e.g. , goldreich & ward 1973 ; weidenschilling 1997 ; youdin & shu 2002 ) . because most previous studies focused on the dust layer and the planetesimal formation , they did not examine in detail a relatively small amount of micron - sized grains that remain floating after the dust layer formation . however , as suggested by nakagawa et al ( 1981 ) and some authors , the floating small grains would play an important role in the radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks even though their total mass is small . the change in seds due to settling of such floating grains",
    "was examined by miyake & nakagawa ( 1995 ) and by dullemond & dominik ( 2004b ) .",
    "however , they did not consider settling coupled with growth .",
    "the variation in the disk optical thickness due to dust growth was also evaluated in some studies on dust growth and settling ( weidenschilling 1984 , 1997 ; weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ; schmitt et al .",
    "however , these evaluations were done only in short - term calculations ( @xmath13yr ) or only at limited radial positions ( i.e. , 1 and 30 au ) . in order to take into account dust growth in analyses of disk observations ,",
    "it is necessary to clarify the general property in the long - term evolution of floating grains and disk optical depth in various disks .    in this series of papers , we investigate dust growth and settling in protoplanetary disks , focusing on floating small grains rather than large grains in dust layers .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of dust growth and settling for various disk models to obtain the general property of the spatial and size distribution of dust grains . using the obtained spatial and size distribution of grains ,",
    "we further examine time - evolution of the disk optical thickness and seds due to dust growth and settling .",
    "our results show that , because of relatively rapid dust growth in the inner disk region , the disk optical thickness decreases more rapidly in the inner region than in the outer .",
    "this makes the radial distribution of the optical thickness less steep , as expected above . the dust emission at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths declines on the time scale @xmath14 yr even without any disk depletion .",
    "therefore , the observed decay of dust emission does not necessarily indicate disk depletion .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider laminar disks as the first step of this series of papers .",
    "as shown by dullemond & dominik ( 2004b ) , vertical stirring by turbulence is effective on dust settling even in weakly turbulent disks with the parameter @xmath15 for the disk viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "furthermore , since turbulence would play a crucial role in the issue of planetesimal formation in a dust layer by self - gravitational instability , it can not be neglected on that issue . however , on the disk optical thickness , essential ingredients would be included in laminar disk cases .",
    "thus the calculations with laminar disks would give deep insights into time - evolution of the optical thickness and disk seds , although the time scale can be affected by turbulence .",
    "hence , the case in laminar disks should be firstly examined as a simple case .",
    "the case in turbulent disks will be investigated in the subsequent paper .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe basic equations and our numerical model of growth and settling .",
    "we show numerical results for various disk models in section 3 .",
    "we also derive an analytical solution of the grain size distribution , which agrees well with numerical results . in section 4 , we examine time - evolution of the disk optical thickness and seds due to dust growth and settling . in the calculation of seds , we used the two - layer model proposed by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) and refined by chiang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the effect of turbulence on dust growth and settling .",
    "we consider a passive protoplanetary disk with no turbulence around a central stars with one solar mass ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the disk has an inner edge at 0.1 au and an outer edge at 150 au . to describe the disk",
    ", we use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath17 of which the origin is located at the central star . the @xmath18-axis",
    "coincide with the rotation axis of the disk . in numerical simulations of dust growth and settling , we assume that the gaseous disk is isothermal in the vertical direction ( i.e. , in the @xmath18-direction ) for simplicity . as seen in the two - layer model of passive disks , however , the surface layer directly irradiated by the central star is much hotter than the disk interior .",
    "nevertheless , our modeling of a vertical isothermal disk would be valid because dust growth and settling in laminar disks are little affected by the disk temperature , as seen in the next section . in the evaluation of seds in section 4 , of course , the vertical temperature distribution will be taken into account with the two - layer model .    under this assumption , the vertical density distribution @xmath19 of the gas component",
    "is given in the hydrostatic equilibrium by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gas surface density and @xmath22 is the pressure scale height of the disk given by @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 @xmath25 is the keplerian angular velocity and @xmath26 is the isothermal sound speed , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the gravitational constant , boltzmann s constant , and the atomic mass unit , respectively ; and @xmath30 and @xmath12 are the disk temperature and the mean molecular weight , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath31 .    dust growth and settling change the disk temperature .",
    "thus , exactly speaking , we need to solve coupled equations of dust growth , settling and the disk temperature .",
    "however , since a change in the disk temperature has a little effect on dust growth and settling , we use a tentative disk temperature for simulations of dust growth and settling .",
    "the tentative disk temperature is calculated in the same manner as the calculation of the temperature of the disk interior of the two - layer model ( i.e. , using equations [ [ eq : ti ] ] and [ [ eq : angle ] ] in the appendix ) but , in this calculation , we assumed that the disk is optically thick ( @xmath32 ) and that the height of the surface layer , @xmath33 , is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "note that we will correctly evaluate the temperatures of the disk interior and the surface layer according to the two - layer model in the calculation of the disk sed ( section 4 ) .",
    "the deviation of the tentative temperature from that of the disk interior reevaluated in section 4 is within 30% .",
    "as for the surface density distribution of gaseous disks , we adopt a power - law distribution of @xmath35 the gas surface density at 1au , @xmath36 , and the power - law index @xmath37 are parameters . in the standard case of the present paper ,",
    "we adopt the values of the mmsn , that is , @xmath38g@xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath41 and the solid material density @xmath42 are set to be 0.014 and 1.4g@xmath39 , respectively in the standard case .",
    "these values are consistent with the solar abundance when h@xmath43o ice is included in grains ( pollack et al.1994 ) .",
    "we also examine cases with a different value of @xmath41 or @xmath42 . at @xmath44 , h@xmath43o evaporates and we should decrease the dust - gas ratio and increase the solid material density .",
    "however , we neglected these changes in the simulations of dust growth and settling for simplicity .      to describe dust growth and settling",
    ", we adopted the basic equations used by nakagawa et al .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the number density of grains with masses between @xmath46 and @xmath47 at a height @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath48 describes the distribution of grains with respect to @xmath46 ( or the size ) and @xmath18 .",
    "the statistical coagulation equation is used to describe evolution of the mass distribution due to collisional growth . to describe dust settling as well as growth",
    ", a vertical advection term is added to the coagulation equation .",
    "that is , the following equation is used : @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0^m k_{m',m - m ' } n(m',z ) n(m - m',z ) dm '   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad \\quad - n(m , z ) \\int_0^{\\infty } k_{m , m ' } n(m',z ) dm ' , \\label{eq : coagsedi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the kernel , @xmath50 , is related to the coalescence rate between grains with masses @xmath46 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the settling velocity of dust grains . in the above ,",
    "the first term on the right - hand side indicates the formation of grains of the mass @xmath46 by collisions between the smaller grains and the second term represents the consumption of grains with the mass @xmath46 due to collisions with other grains .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side is the advection one , which describes the vertical mass transport . in equation  ( [ eq : coagsedi1 ] ) , we neglected the advection term due to the radial mass transport because it is effective only for relatively large grains that settle down to the dust layer .",
    "we also neglected the diffusion term due to turbulence since laminar disks are considered .    the kernel @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the collisional cross section between grains with masses @xmath46 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the sticking probability , and @xmath58 is the relative velocity between grains with @xmath46 and @xmath56 . for dust grains , @xmath55 is equal to the geometrical cross section .",
    "we assume spherical grains in the present study .",
    "then we obtain the cross section @xmath55 as @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the radius of grains with @xmath46 .",
    "the relative velocity @xmath58 will be explained in the next subsection .",
    "the sticking probability @xmath57 is difficult to be determined because it depends on its size , shape , material properties ( e.g. , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) . in the present study",
    ", we regard @xmath57 as a parameter and assume that it is independent of the grain size .      in a laminar disk , grains settle toward its mid - plane .",
    "the settling velocity of each grain is given by the terminal velocity , which is determined by the balance between the gas drag force and the vertical component of the central star s gravity .",

    "the mean free path is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the molecular collision cross section given by @xmath69@xmath70 ( chapman & cowling 1970 ) . at 1au and 10au on the mid - plane in the standard disk , the mean free paths are evaluated to be about 1 cm and 500 cm , respectively .",
    "next , we describe motion of gas and grains .",
    "the velocities of gas and grains , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are obtained in a similar way to nakagawa et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , though they considered equal - sized grains and focused on the dust layer around the mid - plane . when grains have a size distribution , the equations of motion for gas and grains are given by @xmath71 the gas pressure @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 .",
    "at the surface layer directly irradiated by the central star , grains suffers a strong radiative pressure ( takeuchi & lin 2003 ) .",
    "however , we neglected the radiation pressure in equation  ( [ eq : motion_dust ] ) for simplicity .",
    "we introduce a differentially rotating coordinate system with the angular velocity @xmath74@xmath75 $ ] to eliminate the gravity of the central star in the equations of motion . instead of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we use the velocities , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in the rotational frame .",
    "since @xmath78 and @xmath79 are much smaller than the keplerian velocity , we can neglect second - order terms of them in the equations of motion .",
    "then , setting @xmath80 , we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : motion_gas ] ) and ( [ eq : motion_dust ] ) in the rotating cylindrical coordinates as ( cf .",
    "nakagawa et al . 1986 ) @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . from equations",

    "it should be also noted that our definition of @xmath89 is different from that in takeuchi & lin  ( 2002 ) by the factor 2 but the same as nakagawa et al .",
    "the vertical velocity of the gas , @xmath90 , is always negligibly small compared with @xmath91 as shown by nakagawa et al .",

    "we finally explain the relative velocity between grains appearing in the kernel @xmath53 .",

    "the disk extending from 0.1 au to 150 au is logarithmically divided into 21 ring regions .",
    "the median radius of the @xmath96-th ring region is given by @xmath97 au and its width is defined by @xmath98 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : coagsedi1 ] ) is integrated with respect to time with the first order accuracy .",
    "the change in the number density @xmath99 is given by the sum of two changes .",
    "one is the change due to coagulation , which comes from two terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : coagsedi1 ] ) , and the other is the change due to settling , which comes from the second term on the left - hand side .",
    "these two changes are calculated separately at each time step .",
    "the former change is calculated with the fixed bin scheme ( nakagawa et al .",
    "1981 ; ohtsuki et al .  1990 ) .",
    "this scheme is valid for calculations of dust growth because runaway growth does not occur ( tanaka & nakazawa 1994 ) . the latter change is due to the advection term . to calculate it accurately and stably ,",
    "we used the spatially third - order muscl - type ( monotonic upwind scheme for conservation law - type ) scheme developed by van leer ( 1977 ) .",
    "as an initial condition for numerical calculations , all grains have the radius of @xmath100 m initially .",
    "we assume the dust - to - gas ratio is uniform initially .",
    "the density and the temperature of the gaseous disk are not varied with time during numerical simulations for simplicity .    in the numerical integration of equation  ( [ eq : coagsedi1 ] ) , the @xmath18-axis from @xmath101 to @xmath102",
    "is divided into 251 equally spaced grids at each radial position . as for the coordinate of the grain mass , we divide it into 500 discrete fixed mass bins .",

    "we further restricted @xmath109 to solve the grain growth correctly .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the change in the number density due to coagulation at the mass bin of @xmath105 in the @xmath96-th vertical grid at a time step .",
    "the change @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath109 in our scheme .",
    "we regulated the time interval @xmath109 so that the ratio @xmath116 is kept smaller than 0.025 at all mass bins if @xmath115 is negative .",
    "because of this condition , however , @xmath109 tends to be very small by mass bins that contain negligibly small amount of grains . to avoid it ,",
    "if the mass contained in a mass bin is smaller than @xmath117 times the total mass of the simulation , we removed all grains from the mass bin at each time step to prevent it from regulating @xmath109 .",
    "such removal of grains hardly breaks the mass conservation . in our simulation with double precision ,",
    "the relative error of the mass conservation is the order of @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , we checked the coagulation part of our algorithm , by comparing numerical results with analytic solutions to the coagulation equation for the kernel @xmath119 , as done by ohtsuki et al .",
    "initially , all particles have an unit mass and they have an unit number density in this test . figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the result of the comparison between numerical results and analytic solutions .",
    "numerical results agrees with analytic solutions much better than those of ohtsuki et al .",
    "( 1990 ) because we adopted a small mass multiplication factor of 1.15 .",
    "before showing the numerical results , we mention the growth time and the settling time , which have already been examined in the previous studies ( e.g. , safronov 1969 ; weidenschilling 1980 ; nakagawa et al .",
    "1981 , 1986 ) .",
    "according to nakagawa et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , the growth time of grains , @xmath120 , is given by @xmath121 at the last equation , the grain number density @xmath122 is estimated to be @xmath123 ; the collisional cross section @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 under the assumption of similar - size collisions ; and the settling velocity ( eq .  [ [ eq : v_z2 ] ] ) at @xmath126 is substituted to the relative velocity @xmath127 .",
    "the growth time is independent of the grain size , the disk surface density , and the temperature .",
    "the settling time , @xmath128 , is given by @xmath129 where we used equation  ( [ eq : v_z2 ] ) at the last equation , assuming @xmath126 .",
    "the settling time is also independent of the disk temperature and decreases with an increase in grain radius .",
    "the initial grain size is so small ( i.e. , sub - micron size ) that the growth time is much shorter than the settling time in an early stage .",
    "hence such grains grow considerably before settling down by a vertical distance comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "( of course , since the grain growth is driven primarily by the settling velocity , the settling is also essential to the growth of such small grains . ) as grains grow , the settling time eventually becomes comparable to the growth time .",
    "then the grains do not grow much more before settling down to the dust layer ( nakagawa et al .",
    "we can estimate such a critical grain radius , @xmath130 , by equating the settling time with the growth time . from equations  ( [ eq :",
    "t_g ] ) and ( [ eq : t_settle ] ) , we have @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the dust surface density",
    ". the radius @xmath130 corresponds to safronov ( 1969 ) s maximum radius to which grains can grow before settling to the dust layer .",
    "actually , @xmath130 deviates only by a factor @xmath133 from the maximum radius obtained by safronov ( 1969 ) with more exact treatment .",
    "now we show our numerical results on grain growth and settling . instead of the mass distribution @xmath48",
    ", we consider the distribution of the grain radius , @xmath134 , which is defined by @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , by integrating @xmath134 with respect to the height @xmath18 , we define the surface number density of grains with each size , @xmath136 .",
    "that is , @xmath137 the surface number density @xmath136 represents the vertically averaged size distribution .",
    "the dimension of @xmath136 is length@xmath138 because @xmath139 has the unit of number@xmath140length@xmath141 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows evolution of the surface number density @xmath136 at 8au in the standard disk (  2.1 ) , with @xmath142 .",
    "panel  ( a ) of the figure shows the size distributions in the early stage .",
    "grains grow from 0.1@xmath12m - size to micron size in the first thousand years . at 3000 yr",
    ", the high - mass end of the distribution reaches several hundreds @xmath12 m . from equation  ( [ eq : t_g ] ) , the growth time is estimated to be 400yr at 8au .",
    "this value is consistent with the growth of the high - mass end from 1000yr to 3000yr in figure  [ fig:2]a .",
    "we found that the coalescence between grains with comparable masses is dominant during this time interval in the simulation .",
    "thus the assumption of equal - sized collisions in equation  ( [ eq : t_g ] ) would be valid . at 8000yr",
    ", the size distribution has a bump at the high mass - end .",
    "grains in the bump exist in the dust layer , which formed near the mid - plane at that time .",
    "the formation time of the dust layer is roughly given by @xmath143 , regardless of the disk model and the radial position in disks .",
    "this result is consistent with results of the previous studies ( e.g. , safronov 1969 ; weidenschilling 1980 ; nakagawa et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "evolution after the formation of the dust layer is shown in figure  [ fig:2]b . in this stage ,",
    "the size distribution consists of two parts : large grains in the dust layer and small grains floating above the layer .",
    "the floating grains gradually settle down onto the dust layer without considerable growth .",

    "grains in this bump exist at @xmath148 .",

    "the size distribution of floating grains is also characterized by its upper cut - off . the grain radius at the upper cut - off , @xmath149 ,",

    "the upper cut - off radii in the numerical results are well - described by equation  ( [ eq : a_max ] ) .",
    "at the low - mass end , the surface number density decreases with time even in the settling stage .",
    "this is due to grain growth by brownian motion .",
    "as grains approach the mid - plane , their settling velocities decrease while brownian motion do not vary .",
    "thus , since the collision rate between grains is proportional to their relative velocity , brownian motion is effective on grain growth in the settling stage especially for small grains . since smaller grains remain floating at a higher altitude , growth due to brownian motion affects the opacity at the disk surface .",
    "furthermore , growth due to brownian motion is remarkable in an inner part of the disk rather than an outer part because of high temperature at the inner part .",
    "brownian motion and settling deplete floating grains at the low - mass and the high - mass ends , respectively .",
    "these reduce the disk optical thickness in the settling stage .    in the dust layer , grains grow to more than 100-meter - size at @xmath153 yr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b ) .",
    "however , grain growth in the layer would not be calculated accurately because of the following two problems .",
    "the first problem is insufficient vertical resolution .",
    "the vertical resolution @xmath154 , which is @xmath155 in our calculation , gives the minimum thickness of the dust layer .",
    "because of this limit , the dust - gas ratio has an upper limit of the order of unity in our simulations .",
    "nakagawa et al . ( 1986 ) investigated dust growth in the dust layer getting thinner infinitely due to dust settling and showed that dust growth terminates when the gas - dust ratio becomes much larger than unity .",
    "such termination of dust growth does not occur in our simulations since the coarse resolution keep the dust - gas ratio @xmath156 . however , the infinitely shrinking dust layer assumed by nakagawa et al .",
    "( 1986 ) would be unrealistic .",
    "many authors reported that turbulence due to the shear instability prevents the further dust settling when the gas - dust ratio exceeds unity ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1980 ; cuzzi et al .",
    "hence termination of dust growth proposed by nakagawa et al .",
    "( 1986 ) would not occur in the realistic disk .",
    "the second and more serious problem is neglect of the radial drift of grains .",
    "if the radial drift is taken into account , particles with meter - sized would rapidly fall to the central star and be lost ( e.g. , adachi et al . 1976 ) . in spite of above problems in our calculation ,",
    "the inaccuracy in the dust layer would not significantly influence our results on the disk optical thickness because the dust layer has only a minor contribution to the disk optical thickness in most cases .    in figure  [ fig:3 ] ,",
    "vertical density distributions of dust grains are shown .",
    "the vertical axis in the figure is @xmath18 and the horizontal axis is the density of grains , @xmath157 , given by @xmath158 .",

    ", the density of grains is significantly enhanced near the mid - plane and the dust layer forms there .",
    "grains are depleted with time especially at a high altitude of @xmath159 .",
    "the dust growth and settling are expected to be dependent on the following physical parameters : the disk surface densities of gas and dust grains , the temperature , the material density of grains , the sticking probability , and the radial position in the disk ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) .",
    "here we examine the dependence of the size distributions of floating grains on these physical parameters .    in figure  [ fig:4 ] , we show size distributions with different values of the physical parameters .",

    "another simulation similar to the above was done at 32au in the standard disk .",
    "furthermore , two more runs were done at 8 au in disks with the dust surface density ( or equivalently the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath41 ) ten times as large as that of the standard disk and with the temperature three times higher . in figure",
    "[ fig:4]a , these three cases were compared with the standard case in figure  [ fig:2 ] at @xmath160yr .",
    "these all cases have the same size distribution for floating grains in the settling stage .",
    "the upper cut - off radii of the size distributions also have the same value .",
    "this is because @xmath41 and @xmath30 are not included in equation  ( [ eq : a_max ] ) and @xmath161 is independent of @xmath83 in the standard disk .",
    "we also mention distributions in the growth stage . in the growth stage ,",
    "the case at 32au and the case with a high dust - to - gas ratio have different size distributions from others because of their different growth time . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in the disk temperature hardly affects the grain size distribution in the growth stage , too .    in figure  [ fig:4]b",
    ", we showed the dependence on the gas surface density and the material density of grains .",
    "we did runs with a low material density of @xmath162g@xmath39 and with the surface densities of both gas and grains ten times as large as those of the standard disk .",
    "these runs also result in the same power - law size distribution .",
    "the upper cut - off radius in these cases are larger than that of the standard case but they are also well - described with equation  ( [ eq : a_max ] ) .",
    "finally we examine the dependence on the sticking probability . performing two more runs with @xmath163 and 0.3 , we compared these results with the standard case in figure  [ fig:4]c .",
    "the power - law distributions form even for different sticking probabilities but the absolute values of the distribution are inversely proportional to the sticking probability .    in all simulations , the mass of the central star was set to be one solar mass . the central star s mass is included only in @xmath24 in the equations governing the simulations .",
    "if the time and velocities are scaled by @xmath164 and @xmath165,respectively , @xmath24 appears only in the ratio @xmath166 . in the above , we found that the numerical results does not depend on @xmath166 ( or the disk temperature ) .",
    "hence , the above numerical results can be used for stars with different masses if we use the scaled time .    in the above we showed that , in the settling stage , the size distribution of floating grains is universally given by a power - law distribution with the index of @xmath167 , that is , @xmath168 .",

    "we consider epstein s regime for gas drag in equation  ( [ eq : gas_drag4 ] ) because most floating grains are smaller than cm - size in the settling stage .",
    "the vertical distribution of the gas density is generally given by @xmath170 this expression is valid even for the cases of vertically non - isothermal disks . in non - isothermal cases , we set @xmath22 to be the value at the mid - plane to make it independent of @xmath18 . in the isothermal case , the function @xmath171 is given by @xmath172 /\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ ] .",

    "we introduce the normalized vertical axis @xmath177 and the non - dimensional time @xmath178 .",
    "then equation  ( [ eq : settle1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath179 and the solution is expressed as @xmath180 .",
    "that is , @xmath181 the above solution also depends on the initial height @xmath182 .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the solution @xmath183 for various @xmath184 in the isothermal case .",
    "if the initial height is high enough ( @xmath185 ) , the solution is almost independent of @xmath186 except at an early stage .",
    "this is because the gas density is very low at a high altitude and grains settle down rapidly in epstein s regime .",
    "the small floating grains in figure  [ fig:2]b come from the high altitude . on the other hand ,",
    "most grains initially located at a low altitude ( @xmath187 ) are removed by the coagulation with larger ones settling from a high altitude .",
    "thus we only consider grains initially located at a high altitude and neglect the dependence of the solution on @xmath182 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : zsol ] ) represents well - defined trajectory of each grain .",
    "this indicates that there exist grains with a definite size at each height at certain time .",

    "actually , in our numerical simulations , the altitude of each floating grain is well - described by equation  ( [ eq : zsol ] ) and the size segregation occurs .",
    "this size segregation makes the relative velocity between colliding grains small and prevents grain growth considerably in the settling stage .",
    "secondly , we derive a simple relation between the spatial and size distribution @xmath134 and the vertically integrated size distribution @xmath136 .",
    "because of the size segregation , the spatial and size distribution @xmath188 is proportional to the delta function @xmath189 , where the function @xmath190 is given by solving equation  ( [ eq : zsol ] ) with respect to @xmath175 . in a vertical section of ( @xmath18 , @xmath191 ) , there exist grains with sizes ( @xmath190 , @xmath192 ) , where @xmath193 is given by @xmath194 ( see eq .",

    "dust settling , however , decreases the grain number density at each altitude and increases the growth time . at the transition to the settling stage ,",
    "the two time scales equal to each other and , in the settling stage , the growth time further increases because of the size segregation .",
    "hence the size distribution is fixed at the transition ( see also fig .",

    "the depletion time of the energy fluxes at sub - millimeter/ millimeter wavelengths is obtained as several@xmath243yr . in the case with a small @xmath57 or with a larger @xmath245 ,",
    "the depletion time is longer .",
    "our results indicate that the decrease in the observed energy fluxes at millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths can be explained by grain growth and settling without disk depletion .",
    "the gaseous disks themselves can survive more than @xmath239yr . the silicate feature at 10@xmath12 m depletes on the time scale of @xmath239yr because of the formation of the extremely optical thin inner region .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider only laminar disks . here",
    ", we comment on the effect of turbulence on dust growth and disk structure .",
    "vertical stirring by turbulence would prevent dust settling . as shown by dullemond & dominik ( 2004b ) , vertical stirring by turbulence against dust settling is effective even in weakly turbulent disks with the parameter @xmath15 for the disk viscosity .",
    "in turbulent disks , vertical stirring is expected to keep the surface layer high compared with laminar disks . on the other hand",
    ", turbulence also increases the relative velocity between grains .",
    "since the collisional probability is proportional to the relative velocity , turbulence accelerates grain growth , too ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1984 ; mizuno et al . 1988 ) .",
    "acceleration of grain growth would result in a rapid decrease in the opacity and the disk optical thickness .",
    "this would make the surface layer lower .",
    "it is not clear whether the turbulence makes the surface layer higher with stirring or lower with acceleration of grain growth .",
    "furthermore , in sufficiently strong turbulence , collisional disruption due to high relative velocity creates small grains and would increases the optical thickness . to clarify which effect is dominant , it is necessary to perform our simulations of grain growth and settling , by taking into account above effects of turbulence . in the next paper ,",
    "we investigate cases of turbulent disks and examine more realistic evolution of the optical thickness and seds in protoplanetary disks .",
    "we thank y. kitamura , m. honda , and m. momose for valuable comments .",
    "we also thank the anonymous reviewer for many valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "this work is supported by grant - in - aid of the japanese ministry of education , science , and culture ( 15740116 and 16340054 )",
    "here we briefly explain the equations governing the structure of a passive disk in the two - layer model .",
    "the optical thicknesses of the surface layer and the disk interior , @xmath251 , @xmath252 are given by @xmath253 respectively , where the height @xmath254 is the boundary between the surface layer and the disk interior in the normalized vertical axis .",
    "the opacity @xmath214 is given by equation  ( [ eq : kappa ] ) by the use of our numerical results . by the introduction of the normalized axis , the optical thicknesses of them are independent of the disk temperature .",
    "the planck mean optical thicknesses of them are @xmath255 the boundary @xmath254 is indirectly determined by the equation @xmath256 where @xmath235 is the effective temperature of the central star and @xmath257 is the grazing angle ( i.e. the angle between the starlight and the disk surface ) . by the use of @xmath258 , the grazing angle is given by @xmath259 where @xmath236 is the radius of the central star .",
    "when the disk optical thickness is small enough , equation  ( [ eq : zs ] ) does not have a positive solution of @xmath254 .",
    "this corresponds to the case with no disk interior . in this case",
    "we set @xmath260 and , thus , the optical thicknesses of the disk interior , @xmath252 and @xmath261 , are zero .",
    "the grains in the surface layer have various temperatures depending on their radii . instead of the various grain temperatures , we use the mean temperature of the surface layer @xmath249 defined by @xmath262 the temperature of the disk interior @xmath263",
    "is given by @xmath264 }       { 1-\\exp[-2\\tau{_{\\text{p , i}}}(t{_{\\text{i}}})]}. \\label{eq : ti}\\ ] ] in equations  ( [ eq : ts ] ) and ( [ eq : ti ] ) , we doubled the left - hand sides , assuming that the entire star is visible from the surface layer ( dullemond et al .",
    "furthermore , we inserted the factor 2 into the exponential functions in equation  ( [ eq : ti ] ) in order to take into account radiative transfer in the oblique direction in the disk interior .",
    "this is because , in the direction with the angle @xmath265 to the vertical axis , the optical thickness of the disk interior is double of that in the vertical direction .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : zs])-([eq : ti ] ) are coupled with one another .",
    "we numerically solved these equations for a whole disk .",
    "the derivative @xmath266 in equation  ( [ eq : angle ] ) is evaluated with the central difference using the both sides of grids though the one - side difference is used at the innermost and the outermost grids .    by the use of the solutions to the above equations , the emissions ( or the energy fluxes ) at a frequency @xmath267 from the surface layers and the disk interior , @xmath268 , @xmath269 ,",
    "are given by @xmath270 2\\pi r dr \\label{eq : fs}\\ ] ] and @xmath271 2\\pi r dr , \\label{eq : fi}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath272 is the distance from the observer to the source and @xmath96 is the inclination angle of the disk ( @xmath273 means face - on ) .",
    "in the above we assumed that @xmath274 .",
    "the energy flux from the whole disk is given by their sum .",
