    "recently the ams-02 collaboration has reported a significant excess in the cosmic - ray positron fraction over the expected background in the energy range 10 - 350 gev  @xcite .",
    "this high precision measurement of the positron fraction confirms its steady rise in this energy range as previously observed by pamela  @xcite ( recently updated in  @xcite ) and fermi - lat  @xcite ( for earlier experiments , see e.g. , ts93  @xcite , wizards / caprice  @xcite , heat  @xcite and ams-01  @xcite ) .",
    "such a rise can not be explained in the standard astrophysical picture where cosmic - ray positrons and anti - protons are mostly produced as secondary particles due to nuclear interactions of high energy cosmic - ray protons with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and no corresponding increase in the anti - proton flux has been observed  @xcite . moreover , the observed energy spectrum of positron fraction shows no fine structure , and the positron to electron ratio shows no observable anisotropy  @xcite ( which would have been induced by primary sources of cosmic - ray positrons and electrons ) .",
    "these observations , together with the excess in total electron / positron flux observed by atic  @xcite ( also ppb - bets  @xcite ) , hess  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite , pamela  @xcite , and more recently by ams-02  @xcite in the energy range 1 - 700 gev , suggest the existence of some new relatively local primary source(s ) of high energy electrons / positrons , from either a particle physics or an astrophysical origin ( for reviews , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a possible particle physics interpretation of the positron excess observed by ams-02 is the annihilation / decay of tev - scale dark matter ( dm ) particle(s )  @xcite .",
    "this scenario usually requires much larger annihilation cross section than that required to explain the dm relic abundance in the universe through thermal freeze - out .",
    "in addition , since the pamela anti - proton flux shows no excess over expected cosmic - ray background  @xcite , any dm model attempting to explain the positron excess should be leptophilic , i.e. , predominantly producing leptonic final states rather than hadrons .",
    "these models are also subject to strong constraints due to radio flux via synchrotron emission  @xcite and diffuse @xmath2-ray flux via bremsstrahlung and inverse compton scattering  @xcite . besides these cosmic - ray signals",
    ", a large dm annihilation rate could also affect the light element abundances in the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) epoch  @xcite , and also affect the ionization history , thereby distorting the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum  @xcite . using the precision positron excess data from ams-02 , stringent upper limits on the dm annihilation rate",
    "have been derived  @xcite for dm masses below @xmath3 gev , annihilating to leptonic final states .",
    "astrophysical accelerators like pulsars ( fast rotating magnetized neutron stars ) and pulsar wind nebulae are also known to be powerful sources of energetic electron - positron pairs within our galaxy , and provide an alternative explanation of the ams-02 result  @xcite , though plagued by large inherent astrophysical uncertainties , e.g. , the number and energy distribution of electron - positron pairs injected into the ism .",
    "although currently we can not discriminate between a dm and pulsar origin of the observed positron excess , the future precision data from ams-02 , especially on secondary - to - primary ratios of cosmic - ray nuclei species , may be able to solve this longstanding issue  @xcite . note that that if the observed positron excess has a particle physics origin , it is expected to be isotropic in nature .",
    "the recent updates from ams-02  @xcite indicate such an isotropy in the fluctuation of the positron ratio , with an upper limit on the amplitude of dipole anisotropy , @xmath4 at 95% cl for any axis in galactic coordinates in the energy range of 16 - 350 gev .",
    "however , this can not yet be taken as an evidence against an astrophysical origin of the positron excess due to the inherent uncertainties associated with source and propagation effects ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide a particle physics interpretation of the ams-02 results in a simple extension of the sm accommodating non - zero neutrino masses as well as a cold dm candidate .",
    "the particle content of the sm is supplemented by an @xmath5-triplet scalar field @xmath6 , thus leading to non - zero neutrino masses via type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "apart from explaining neutrino masses , some other nice features of type - ii seesaw models are : ( a ) restoration of the electroweak vacuum stability up to the planck scale for a large range of model parameter space  @xcite , and ( b ) rich lhc phenomenology for a low seesaw scale  @xcite since the @xmath5-triplet scalars directly couple to the sm gauge bosons and leptons .",
    "in addition , light triplet scalars can significantly modify the higgs - to - diphoton  @xcite and higgs - to-@xmath7+photon  @xcite decay rates which are correlated in the type - ii seesaw model for most of the allowed parameter space  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for an observable ( @xmath8 ) enhancement in the higgs - to - diphoton rate over its sm expectation , there exists an upper bound on the triplet mass ( @xmath9 gev ) from vacuum stability requirements  @xcite , thus making these triplet scalars completely accessible at the lhc .",
    "it may be noted here that the latest atlas results still show a persistent excess in the @xmath10 signal strength : @xmath11  @xcite , whereas the corresponding cms best - fit value is much lower : @xmath12 from mva analysis , whereas their cut - based analysis gives @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "more data on precision higgs measurements in future should be able to resolve this discrepancy between the two experiments .",
    "the required dm content of the universe  @xcite can be easily accommodated in a non - supersymmetric scenario by adding a sm singlet scalar field ( @xmath14 )  @xcite whose stability can be guaranteed by assigning it an odd @xmath15-parity . when embedded in the type - ii seesaw ,",
    "the leptophilic nature of @xmath14 , as required to fit the ams-02 data , can be attributed to its interactions with the @xmath5-triplet scalar field @xmath16 which dominantly decays to leptonic final states for a small triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath17 mev .",
    "an important distinguishing feature of this model is that the final - state lepton flavor due to dm annihilation is intimately connected to the neutrino mass hierarchy through the dirac yukawa coupling in the model .",
    "thus the amount of electron / positron flux produced from the dm annihilation , and hence , the goodness of fit to the ams-02 data , which now offer an unprecedented accuracy , can provide a new probe of the neutrino mass hierarchy in this class of models .    in its minimal version ,",
    "this model requires a large  boost factor \" of order @xmath18 - @xmath19 in the dm annihilation rate to explain the observed positron excess .",
    "such a boost factor could have either an astrophysical origin due to small - scale inhomogeneities in the dm density distribution which can not be excluded even with the highest resolution numerical simulations available at present  @xcite , or a particle physics origin due to the breit - wigner enhancement mechanism  @xcite which can be easily implemented in our model , for instance , by introducing another @xmath15-even singlet real scalar field @xmath20 coupling to both @xmath14 and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "we find that such large boost factors , as required to explain the ams-02 positron data , are still consistent with the current upper limits on dm annihilation to neutrinos and gamma - rays derived from icecube  @xcite and fermi - lat  @xcite data respectively , except for the case in which the dm and triplet masses are quasi - degenerate . we perform a @xmath21-minimization taking into account the ams-02 positron fraction data to find the @xmath22 allowed ranges of the dm mass and boost factor in our model .",
    "it turns out that the goodness of fit for the normal hierarchy ( nh ) case is somewhat better than for the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) case , thus implying that this model prefers a nh of neutrino masses .",
    "this is one of the main results of our paper .",
    "after fixing the model parameters to fit the ams-02 positron excess , we calculate the model predictions for total electron plus positron flux and find that it is consistent for the nh case with the recently released ams-02 flux  @xcite , while the ih case is again disfavored as it gives a larger flux in the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the predictions for the diffuse photon flux in this model are also consistent with the latest fermi - lat results  @xcite .",
    "finally , we justify the leptophilic nature of the dm candidate in our model , as required to explain the ams-02 positron excess and the absence of a corresponding excess in the observed anti - proton flux from pamela  @xcite , which leads an upper limit on the dm - higgs scalar quartic coupling , @xmath23 .",
    "this implies an indirect upper limit on the dm - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross section of about @xmath24 ( for a dm mass of 1 tev ) which is roughly two orders of magnitude stronger than the current direct detection experimental bound from lux  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we briefly discuss the relevant features of the model and obtain a fit to the neutrino oscillation data for both normal and inverted hierarchies ; in section  [ sec2a ] , we summarize the current experimental constraints in the triplet scalar sector , and in section  [ sec2b ] , we calculate the dm annihilation rate in this model . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we perform a @xmath21-fit to the ams-02 positron fraction data for both nh and ih cases in two distinct kinematic regimes . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we compare our model predictions for various fluxes : total electron+positron flux , photon flux and neutrino flux with the corresponding experimental results . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    ", we comment on the effect of a large dm - higgs quartic coupling @xmath25 on our model predictions .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "in the minimal type - ii seesaw model , in addition to the sm fields , a triplet scalar field @xmath16 is introduced , which transforms as @xmath26 under the @xmath27 gauge group : @xmath28 where @xmath29 s are the usual @xmath30 pauli matrices , and @xmath31 .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian for this model is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dirac charge conjugation matrix with respect to the lorentz group , @xmath34 denotes the yukawa couplings in the lepton sector , and @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) is the @xmath5 lepton doublet .    following the notation used in  @xcite , the scalar potential relevant for the minimal type - ii seesaw",

    "the coupling constants @xmath39 can be chosen to be real through a phase redefinition of the field @xmath16 . also , we have chosen @xmath40 in order to ensure the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath27 gauge group to @xmath41 by a nonzero vev of the neutral component of the sm higgs doublet @xmath42 , @xmath43 with @xmath44 gev , while @xmath45 can be of either sign .",
    "note that the @xmath46 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vpd ] ) is the _ only _ source of lepton number violation at the lagrangian level before the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a non - zero vev for the higgs doublet field @xmath42 induces a tadpole term for the scalar triplet field @xmath16 via this term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vpd ] ) , thereby generating a non - zero vev for its neutral component , @xmath47 , and breaking lepton number by two units .",
    "this results in the following majorana mass matrix for the neutrinos : @xmath48 in order to satisfy the low - energy neutrino oscillation data  @xcite , we fix the structure of the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath49 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutrino ] ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the diagonal neutrino mass eigenvalue matrix , and @xmath52 is the standard pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix which is usually parametrized in terms of the three mixing angles @xmath53 , and one dirac ( @xmath54 ) and two majorana ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 phases : @xmath57 where @xmath58 . for our illustration purposes , we assume the majorana phases in the pmns matrix to be zero , and use the central values of a recent global analysis of the 3-neutrino oscillation data  @xcite : @xmath59 to obtain the following structure of the yukawa coupling matrix from eq .",

    "( [ yd ] ) are completely fixed by the solar and atmospheric mass - squared differences .",
    "however , our final results will not depend on the absolute value of the lightest neutrino mass , unless it is close to the degenerate limit , @xmath61 ev , in which case , we have democratic yukawa couplings of the triplet scalar to all the charged - leptons .",
    "we do not consider this special case in our analysis , since this is in conflict with the most stringent upper limit on the sum of light neutrino masses from planck data : @xmath62 ev at 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "for the scalar sector of the minimal type - ii seesaw model , after the neutral fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 acquire vevs , we have seven physical mass eigenstates @xmath65 with the following eigenvalues : @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67 , the mixing between the doublet and triplet scalars is usually small ( unless the @xmath56-even scalars @xmath68 and @xmath69 are close to being mass - degenerate ) . in this limit , the mass of the ( dominantly doublet ) lightest @xmath56-even scalar is simply given by @xmath70 ( as in the sm ) independent of the mass scale @xmath71 , whereas the other ( dominantly triplet ) scalars have @xmath71-dependent mass .",
    "the triplet vev contributes to the sm @xmath72- and @xmath7-boson masses at the tree - level thereby affecting the @xmath73-parameter .",
    "the constraints on the @xmath73-parameter from the electroweak precision data  @xcite require the triplet vev to be very small compared to the electroweak vev : @xmath74 gev  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the singly- and doubly - charged scalars in the type - ii seesaw model contribute to the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes such as @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and also to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the current experimental limits on lfv put a stringent lower bound  @xcite @xmath77    there also exist strong lower limits on the type - ii seesaw scale from collider searches for doubly - charged higgs bosons decaying to pairs of prompt , isolated , high-@xmath78 electrons / muons with the same electric charge  @xcite .",
    "the masses of doubly - charged higgs bosons are constrained depending on the branching ratio into these leptonic final states .",
    "assuming 100% branching ratio for leptonic final states , which is true for large yukawas or small @xmath79 mev , the current lower limits are in the range of 375 - 409 gev depending on the flavor of the final - state lepton - pair  @xcite .",
    "these limits are significantly weakened for @xmath80 mev as the leptonic branching ratio becomes small , and could be as low as 100 gev in certain cases  @xcite .      the minimal type - ii seesaw model can be extended to accommodate a cold dm candidate by simply adding a sm singlet real scalar field @xmath14  @xcite .",

    "the fermi - lat spectrum is for all sky minus ( galactic plane+galactic center ) and for high latitude region ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "we note that while the gamma - ray limits are severe for dm annihilation into two - body final states  @xcite , the four - body final states ( as in our case ) are relatively less constrained  @xcite . in our model , photons can be emitted from external lepton legs , final - state radiation or in a subsequent decay of the pair of leptons directly produced from @xmath16 decay . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the nh case produces more photon flux compared to the ih case at higher energies .",
    "this is mainly due to the photons coming from tau decays in the nh case .",
    "the photon energy spectrum for the nh case agrees well with the excess photon flux at high energies observed by fermi - lat , but eventually falls off to the background level as we approach the dm mass .",
    "more precise measurements of the photon flux at higher energies ( beyond tev ) should be able to ( in)validate this feature , and hence , provide a test of this model .",
    "note that since the dm candidate in our model interacts with charged @xmath5-triplet scalars which directly couple to sm photons , the dm can pair - annihilate to photons : @xmath85 ( and also @xmath86 ) via one - loop diagrams mediated by charged scalars .",
    "this process can lead to a monochromatic gamma - ray line spectrum with energy @xmath87 for @xmath85 , and for @xmath86 , with photon - energy @xmath88 . for a relatively light dm",
    ", this mechanism was invoked in  @xcite to explain the 130 gev @xmath2-ray line spectrum feature recently reported  @xcite in the publicly available fermi - lat data  @xcite . however , we find that our best - fit dm mass values explaining the ams-02 positron excess are too high to account for the @xmath89 gev line signal , either directly from dm annihilation or from internal bremsstrahlung .",
    "thus we conclude that it is very hard to simultaneously explain both the ams-02 positron excess and the fermi - lat 130 gev gamma - ray line signal in our model ( as generically the case for any single - component dm model ) .",
    "so far we have considered the case @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ an ] ) . in this case",
    ", there is no significant excess in the anti - proton flux as the dm annihilation is dominantly to leptonic final states . in this section",
    "we justify this choice of parameters by noting that if we switch on a large @xmath25 coupling , the dm pair can annihilate to a sm higgs pair which subsequently decays to mostly bottom quarks ( 58% branching ratio for @xmath91 gev ) and @xmath92 ( 22% branching ratio ) .",
    "this has two adverse effects on the model : first , the hadronic final states will produce a sizable anti - proton flux .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath93 and for nh . also shown for comparison",
    "are the pamela data taken from  @xcite , and the expected background anti - proton flux from cosmic rays , obtained using galprop with the same input parameters as given in section  [ sec3 ] for the ams-02 data fitting .",
    "it is clear that for any non - negligible value of @xmath25 , the anti - proton excess will be inconsistent with the observed flux from pamela  @xcite which is in good agreement with the cosmic - ray anti - proton background .",
    "in fact , using this information , one can derive an upper limit on @xmath23 , to be consistent with the pamela data , although , although this limit is subject to the propagation model uncertainties .",
    "a large @xmath25 will also lead to a large dm - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross section through a @xmath94-channel higgs exchange .",
    "for instance , for @xmath91 gev , we have @xmath95 thus an upper limit on @xmath23 from the anti - proton flux implies an upper limit on @xmath96 ( for @xmath97 tev ) in our model . note that this indirect limit derived from anti - proton flux constraints",
    "is about two orders of magnitude stronger than the current direct detection limit of @xmath98 from lux  @xcite for a tev - scale dm .",
    "secondly , for a given dm mass the @xmath99 final states from the higgs decay will lead to more positron flux in the lower energy regime due to the fact that the higgs produced due to dm annihilation is highly boosted to start with , and moreover , the positrons coming from @xmath100-decay lead to a further widening of their energy spectrum .",
    "thus , we would expect more positron fraction at lower energies than at higher energies in this case .",
    "this significantly worsens the fitting with ams-02 data which has very precise fraction values in the low - energy bins .",

    "<S> although we require a larger boost factor for the normal hierarchy case , this is still consistent with the current upper limits derived from fermi - lat and icecube data for case ( a ) . moreover , the absence of an excess anti - proton flux as suggested by pamela data sets an indirect upper limit on the dm - nucleon spin - independent elastic scattering cross section which is stronger than the existing dm direct detection bound from lux in the ams-02 preferred dm mass range . </S>"
