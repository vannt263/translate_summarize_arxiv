    "ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) is the name that has been assigned ( first by @xcite ) to an apparently new class of compact objects with masses and luminosities ranging between globular clusters ( gcs ) and dwarf galaxies .",
    "their origin and nature are not yet completely understood .",
    "most authors assume that they in fact may have various formation channels ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first ucds were discovered in the proximity of ngc1399 , the dominant galaxy of the fornax cluster @xcite .",
    "afterwards , ucds have also been found in other galaxy clusters / groups @xcite .",
    "although there is no generally accepted definition of ucd luminosities , @xcite suggests a @xmath7 absolute magnitude range of @xmath8 .",
    "the defining criterion of what is a ucd varies for different authors .",
    "metallicity , radius , luminosity or mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath9 ) tresholds have been proposed , according to the behaviour of these properties in compact objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of multiple stellar populations , as found in @xmath10cent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "employ the effective radius ( @xmath3 ) as the property which separates ucds from gcs . setting a limit of @xmath11 = 10pc ,",
    "they include objects as faint as @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested @xmath13 as a limiting mass .    although some objects were found in merger remnants of intermediate age like w3 in ngc7252 @xcite , most ucds present an old stellar population ( t @xmath14gyr , @xcite ) and colours within a similar range as gcs .",
    "their @xmath3 can reach up to @xmath15pc , and their brightness profiles present nuclear and halo components .",

    "dynamical masses range between @xmath17 m @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "some studies find that mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath9 ) can assume values twice as high as those of galactic gcs of similar metallicity @xcite .",
    "there is not a general agreement about the presence of dark matter haloes in these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analysed the internal kinematics of ucd3 in fornax with spatially resolved spectroscopy , and they did not find evidence for a dark matter component in this object .    ) , width=302 ]    .",

    "* at the adopted antlia distance , @xmath19 corresponds to @xmath20*. north is up , east to the left .",
    "[ dss ]      a considerable number of theories attempt to explain the existence of this class of stellar systems .",
    "the most discussed ones are :    1 .",
    "ucds can be remnants of galaxies , for instance nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de , n ) , that had been disrupted by the tidal forces of massive galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   ucds may be the result of the fusion of several young star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ucds can be the brightest members of the gc system ( gcs ) associated to a host galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed information about formation scenarios has been given by @xcite and , more recently , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work is part of the antlia cluster project , that is devoted to study the different stellar systems of this cluster , from gcs @xcite to the galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the antlia galaxy cluster , located in the southern sky at low galactic latitude ( @xmath21 ) , is after virgo and fornax the nearest populous galaxy cluster .",
    "the central part of the cluster consists of two subgroups , each one dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy ( ngc3258 and ngc3268 ) of comparable luminosity .",
    "galaxies located in both subgroups present an elongated projected distribution , in the direction that joins the two giant ones .",
    "@xcite recently presented a study of the inner 12arcmin of the antlia cluster , using xmm ",
    "they consider antlia as ` the nearest example of a galaxy cluster in an intermediate merger stage without a cool core ' .",
    "while the early- to late - type galaxy ratio indicates an evolved system , the existence of two subgroups , which may also be present in the overall mass distribution , means that the total system has not yet completed its evolution .",
    "we might be witnessing the merging of two , rather evolved , compact groups / clusters .    due to the influence that environmental conditions may have on the origin and dynamical evolution of the ucds , the antlia cluster is a very interesting system to study .",
    "moreover , increasing the sample of analysed ucds will help to understand their nature .",
    "we present here the first results of the search for ucds in the antlia cluster , focusing on the surroundings of ngc3258 . in this investigation ,",
    "first , we analyse a preliminary sample that also includes the ` supposedly ' brightest gcs and will generally refer to both , bright gcs and ucds , as ` compact objects ' .",
    "then , we perform a more refined selection ( see sect .",
    "4 ) of a specific ` ucd sample ' ( antlia members and candidates ) and use it for the second part of this research .",
    "preliminary results on the search for ucd candidates in antlia have been given by @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section2 describes the observations , reductions , and adopted criteria for the compact objects selection . in section3",
    "we present and discuss the results regarding their colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) , size , size - luminosity relation , and we also compare magnitudes and colours of the compact objects with those obtained for a sample of antlia de , n nuclei .",
    "the final selection of ucd members and candidates is performed in section4 , that deals with their projected spatial distribution , colours , metallicities , as well as the antlia global colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",

    "the lower panel shows the residuals of the global fit .",
    "this is the only galaxy from our sample for which a two  component srsic profile was needed to fit accurately the surface brightness profile.,width=317 ]    the photometric observations used in this paper are obtained from three different sources .",
    "part of the material consists of fors1vlt images in the @xmath7 and @xmath23 bands ( programme 71.b-0122(a ) , pi b. dirsch ) .",
    "these images correspond to four fields , two of them are centred on each one of the dominant galaxies , ngc3258 ( field1 ) and ngc3268 ( field3 ) , the third one is located in the region between them ( field2 ) , and the last one is located to the north - west direction ( field4 , see fig.[dss ] ) .",
    "we also use wide  field images that were taken with the mosaic camera mounted at the ctio 4-m blanco telescope ( indicated by the outer box in fig.[dss ] ) during 4/5 april 2002 .",
    "cousins @xmath24 and washington @xmath25 filters were used , although the genuine washington system uses @xmath26 instead of @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the kron ",
    "cousins @xmath24 filter is more efficient than @xmath26 and that there is only a small colour term and zero - point difference between magnitudes in both filters ( we use @xmath27 from @xcite ) .",
    "these images were originally used to perform the first study of the gcss of ngc3258 and ngc3268 in antlia @xcite .",
    "in addition , an acs field on ngc3258 ( indicated by the framed box in fig.[dss ] ) observed with the @xmath28filter was obtained from the hubble space telescope data archive .",
    "this image is the composite of four 570s exposures and corresponds to the programme 9427 ( pi : w. e. harris ) .",
    "we have also obtained gemini  gmos multi - object spectra for compact objects located in five antlia fields ( programmes gs-2008a - q-56 , pi t. richtler ; gs-2009a - q-25 , pi l. p. bassino ) .",
    "the masks designed for these programmes were devoted to the study of the general population of the cluster , not only the compact objects . in all cases ,",
    "the b600_g5303 grating blazed at @xmath29 was used , with three different central wavelengths ( 5000 , 5050 , and @xmath30 ) in order to fill in the ccd gaps . a slit width of 1arcsec",
    "was selected .",
    "considering an average seeing of 0.5  0.6arcsec , this configuration gives a wavelength coverage of @xmath31 depending on the positions of the slits , and a spectral resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "the total exposure times ranged between 2 and 3.3h . individual calibration flats and cuar arc spectra",
    "were obtained for each exposure during the programme time , in order to avoid small variations that could be introduced by flexion of the telescope .",
    "figure[ran ] shows the projected spatial distribution of gc candidates with @xmath33 around ngc3258 ( circles ) , and the spectroscopically observed sources ( squares ) .",
    "in order to work in an homogeneous way and not to lose any ucd candidate that might has been discarded in the past as too bright for being a gc , we redo the basic photometry for the fors1 and mosaic data .    the fors1 photometry was performed with daophot within iraf , using a spatially variable point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the point source selection was based on the @xmath34 and sharpness parameters from the allstar task .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the observations and the calibration equations applied to obtain colours and magnitudes in the standard system .",
    "the mosaic photometry was also performed with daophot .",
    "the extended galaxy light was subtracted , using a median ring filter with an inner radius of 9 arcsec and an outer radius of 11 arcsec .",
    "this facilitates point source detection , without modifying the results of the subsequent photometry @xcite .",
    "the software sextractor @xcite was applied to the sky - subtracted @xmath24 image to obtain an initial selection of point sources .",
    "the software was set so as to consider a positive detection every group of , at least , five connected pixels above a threshold of @xmath35 ( detect_minarea and detect_tresh parameters , respectively ) .",
    "at the antlia distance , that we adopt as approximately @xmath36mpc ( distance modulus @xmath37 , @xcite ) , even the larger ucds are seen as point sources on our mosaic images .",
    "thus , to select point sources we use the star / galaxy classifier from sextractor , through the class@xmath38star parameter , that takes values close to one for point sources and close to zero for extended sources ( see the right - hand panel in fig.[sex ] ) .",
    "all the objects with class@xmath38star@xmath39 are rejected .",
    "the aperture photometry was performed using the task phot .",
    "afterwards , a spatially variable psf was built , employing about a hundred bright stars , well distributed over the whole field .",
    "the final point source selection was based on the @xmath34 and sharpness parameters from the allstar task , and the aperture corrections and calibration equations were obtained from @xcite .    in the reduction of the acs data ,",
    "the surface brightness profile of the galaxy was obtained with the task ellipse and the corresponding synthetic galaxy generated with bmodel ( both iraf tasks ) was subtracted from the original image .",
    "a first source selection was made with sextractor , considering a positive identification every detection of at least three connected pixels above a threshold of @xmath35 . in this case , as ucds may be marginally resolved on acs images at the antlia distance , we decided to reject all objects with class@xmath38star@xmath40 ( see the left - hand panel in fig.[sex ] ) .",
    "again , aperture photometry was performed using the task phot , and the psf was built with the daophot / iraf homonymous task , selecting bright stars well distributed on the field . in the following , we will keep just the instrumental @xmath28 magnitudes .",
    "a list of ucd and bright gc candidates was then compiled with the objects that satisfy the source selection criteria in the three photometric data sets ( from fors1 , mosaic , and acs images ) , and have magnitudes in the range @xmath41 . at the adopted antlia distance",
    ", it corresponds to an apparent magnitude range @xmath42 . considering the mean colour for early - type galaxies @xmath43 given by @xcite also valid for ucds",
    ", the previous magnitude range corresponds to @xmath44 in the washington photometric system .",
    "this list should be considered as a preliminary selection , namely the compact objects , as we will refine it later when sizes are also taken into account to separate the ucds .",
    "on the basis of the hypothesis that links bright compact objects ( i.e. ucds ) with the nuclei of de , n galaxies , it was tried to isolate the nuclei of de , n in order to compare their photometric properties with those of ucds .",
    "a list of antlia des was compiled considering the members confirmed by radial velocities",
    "@xcite as well as galaxies labelled as ` definite members ' by @xcite ( type-1 , in their classification ) .",
    "even though @xcite only used photometric galaxy properties as membership criteria of the galaxies , subsequent spectroscopic observations indicated that the vast majority of type-1 galaxies are in fact antlia members ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "ten dwarf galaxies from this member list are located on our fors1vlt images , and for nine of them we could obtain luminosity profiles . the remaining one ( fs90 - 109 , where fs90 corresponds to the identification given by @xcite ) is very close to a saturated star , making it difficult to obtain an acceptable fit .    the following process was applied to get such galaxy profiles .",
    "first , the fors1vlt images were visually inspected to determine if the extended light of bright galaxies , present in the field , could affect the dwarf photometric measurements . in field1 the luminosity profile of ngc3258 was obtained using the task ellipse within iraf , after masking all the bright objects in the field .",
    "then , a model galaxy generated with the task bmodel was subtracted from the original image .",
    "this second image , free of the extended light from ngc3258 , was used to fit the luminosity profile of ngc3260 , another bright galaxy present in this field . once again",
    ", a model galaxy was generated with bmodel and subtracted from the original image .",
    "the resultant image was used to obtain the surface brightness profile of ngc3258 , repeating the iterative process three times for each filter .",
    "the final models of both bright galaxies were then subtracted from the original image .",
    "a similar process was implemented for field3 , subtracting the light from galaxies ngc3267 , ngc3268 and fs90 - 175 .",
    "the fields2 and 4 do not contain bright galaxies .",
    "the correspoding background levels were calculated for each image using its mode .",
    "this was done applying a rejection level of three times the dispersion to eliminate outliers , and the mode was re - obtained .",
    "this iterative process was repeated 50 times .",
    "also , for each de the surrounding background was searched for possible gradients .",
    "a plane was fitted when necessary , in order to take into account possible variations of the background in the region where dwarfs were located , originated in the subtracted bright galaxies luminosity profiles , or the contribution of bright saturated stars .    for every galaxy ,",
    "the ellipse task was used to obtain the luminosity profiles in both @xmath7 and @xmath23 filters . these de profiles",
    "are usually characterized by srsic models @xcite , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering surface brightness units ( magarcsec@xmath45 ) , an alternative form for the equation of such models is :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the central surface brightness , @xmath48 is a scale parameter and @xmath49 is the srsic index .",
    "if this is compared with the original form of the srsic law ,    @xmath50\\right\\}\\ ] ]    it follows that n@xmath51n , and + @xmath52\\ ] ]    @xmath53    for each dwarf galaxy , its calibrated surface brightness profile was fitted by a srsic law .",
    "the residuals between the observed and fitted profiles were obtained in all cases . for those galaxies where",
    "one srsic law did not provided an acceptable fit , due to the presence of a nucleus , a two  component fit was performed . in these cases ,",
    "first a single srsic profile was fitted to the outer region of the galaxy , providing a very good fit to the halo component .",
    "then , it was subtracted from the intensity profile of the galaxy , resulting in a profile intrinsically dominated by the nuclear component .",
    "nuclei present half - light radii of only a few parsecs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so they appear as point sources on our fors1 images . for this reason , the total flux of the nucleus was directly obtained from the luminosity profile , once the outer component had been subtracted .",
    "then , the integrated magnitude of the nucleus was calculated from this flux .    from this sample , only for one galaxy a single srsic profile could reproduce its surface brightness profiles .",
    "the remaining eight had nuclei , and seven were well described by compositions of a srsic halo and a point - source - like nucleus .",
    "@xcite classified three of them as de , n ( fs90 - 87 , fs90 - 162 and fs90 - 176 ) and three as de ( fs90 - 103 , fs90 - 186 and fs90 - 196 ) .",
    "for one , the existence of a nucleus was under debate ( fs90 - 159 ) .",
    "fs90 - 136 was the only one well fitted by a single srsic profile , despite that @xcite classify it as a de , n .",
    "the remaining dwarf is fs90 - 177 .",
    "it is described by @xcite as d : e , n with total b magnitude @xmath54 . in this case",
    "a two  component srsic profile was needed to fit accurately the surface brightness profile of the galaxy extended component .",
    "the process was similar to that followed in the previous cases .",
    "every component was fitted independently to the profile , after subtracting the profiles obtained for the outer ones .",
    "the implementation of an additional component must be carefully analysed , in the sense that it could have no physical support and be described just an image defect .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig.[fs177 ] where the results of the fits for this galaxy are shown , this additional component was needed to obtain an acceptable fit .",
    "data reduction was performed using the gemini.gmos package within iraf .",
    "a master bias was constructed for each observing run using approximately 20 bias images , obtained from the gemini science archive ( gsa ) .",
    "these images are selected as the ones taken as close as possible to the science ones . in order to remove cosmic rays from science images ,",
    "the fwhm of a gaussian fit to the lines in the cuar arc spectra was measured .",
    "then , this value was used as a minimum rejection limit in the gsreduce task .",
    "the wavelength calibration was obtained with the task gswavelength .",
    "the list of wavelength calibration lines was constructed from the default list provided by the gmos package , after removing the lines that in a visual inspection of our cuar arc images appeared to be faint , extremely close to another line , or with an unusual profile .",
    "then , images were rectified and wavelength - calibrated with gstransform task .",
    "for all the spectra , individual exposures were combined to achieve a higher s / n .",
    "the trace of every object was obtained from the combined images , and then used to extract spectra from the individual exposures .",
    "the y - positions in the slit for the individual exposures were the same for each object .",
    "radial heliocentric velocities for the compact objects in the gmos fields were measured using the task fxcor in the noao.rv package within iraf . for this purpose",
    ", templates were obtained from the single stellar population ( ssp ) model spectra at the miles website ( http://www.iac.es/proyecto/miles , @xcite ) , considering a ssp with metallicity [ m / h]=-0.71 , a unimodal initial mass function with a slope of @xmath55 , and ages of 8 and 10gyr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the templates is @xmath56 , and the spectral resolution is @xmath57 fwhm . in all cases",

    "we will come back later to the cmr once the antlia de , n nuclei have been added .",
    "all antlia compact objects shown in fig.[cmd ] are bluer than @xmath171 , while the fornax sample reaches significantly redder colours . if we accept that compact objects brighter than @xmath172 are mostly ucds , their mean @xmath173 colour is @xmath174 in antlia , and @xmath175 in fornax . in order to compare with colours of regular gcs ( not just the brightest ones ) ,",
    "we recall that for old gcs , the limit between metal - poor ( ` blue ' ) and metal - rich ( ` red ' ) ones is taken at @xmath176 by @xcite , using the same vlt data set .",
    "thus , only two out of the ten antlia compact objects in the cmd are redder than this limit . although the virgo ucd sample is small , it can be seen that except the two very bright ones , the rest seem to be evenly distributed with respect to this blue / red gcs colour limit . in this sense , @xcite analysed a larger sample of ucds around m87 , and show that for magnitudes fainter than @xmath177 , these objects cover a narrow colour range , similar to the blue m87 gcs .",
    "regarding the sample of fornax compact objects , they cover the whole gc colour range , that is approximately @xmath178 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "on one side , we are dealing with a small sample .",
    "on the other side , if we compare the gcss associated to both dominant galaxies in antlia , ngc3258 and ngc3268 , the system around ngc3258 has a smaller fraction of red gcs and it does not extend to redder colours as much as the ngc3268 one does . then , it may be just a consequence of the whole gc colour distribution being bluer too . in this case , one might wonder whether these ucds around ngc3258 are closely related to an extension of the gcs towards brighter luminosities .",

    "the @xmath3 obtained with both analytic functions are depicted in fig.[rvsr ] , showing a good consistency between the results within the errors .",

    "this break in the size - luminosity plane , attributed to the limit between gcs and ucds , does not appear to be well defined as in the literature it spans integrated magnitudes @xmath316 .",
    "however , it should be taken into account that the existence of such an ` abrupt ' change in the slope of this relation is quite unlikely , as the evidence points to a magnitude range where both ucds and gcs coexist , and also the distance and photometric errors are affecting directly the absolute magnitude determination .",

    "the position angle ( pa ) of the first eigenvector ( pa@xmath321 , red arrow in fig.[pca ] ) , is slightly different than that of the corresponding eigenvector obtained for the gc candidates ( @xmath322 and @xmath319 ) within the radial range 0.52arcmin from ngc3258 ( pa@xmath323 , green arrow in fig.[pca ] ) .",
    "this latter pa is in agreement with those obtained by @xcite and @xcite studying the azimuthal distribution of the ngc3258 gcs , i.e. @xmath324 and @xmath325 , respectively .",
    "taking into account the small size of the ucd sample , it can be considered that the results of pca of both samples , ucds and gcs , show similar preferential directions for their projected spatial distributions .",

    "thus , the gcs of ngc3258 is elongated in the direction towards ngc3268 , and a similar effect is present in the x - ray emission around ngc3258 , that has an extension in the same direction .",
    "the results of the pca suggest that ucds also present a projected distribution with a similar orientation .",
    "all this evidence lends support to the idea that tidal forces , between both giant ellipticals , may be playing an important role in modelling the spatial distribution of the hot intra - cluster gas and stellar systems at the antlia cluster core . @xcite",
    "have shown that each giant is surrounded by a retinue of normal and dwarf early - type galaxies , and this scenario may correspond to an ongoing merger between two groups in which all , i.e. galaxies , ucds , gcs , and hot gas , seem to participate .",

    "a kmm test was applied , using the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "considering as the null hypothesis that the ucd sample colour distribution is better represented by the sum of two homoscedastic ( i.e. with similar dispersion ) gaussians than by a single gaussian , the result indicates that this hypothesis can not be rejected , with a @xmath331 of confidence .",
    "however , the results of this kmm test point out that the existence of the second ( redder ) gaussian is based only on the two redder members of the sample .",
    "these are the only ucds for which the algorithm estimates a probability of belonging to the red subpopulation significantly different from zero .",
    "then , we decided to rerun the kmm test excluding these two red objects from the ucd sample , and then the null hypothesis was rejected . according to these results , the colour distribution of ucds in the vicinity of ngc3258 is mainly described by a single gaussian , with the exception of the two redder members .",
    "their colours are @xmath332 , i.e. within the colour range of blue gcs and in agreement with the results obtained at section3.1 for the preliminar sample , where fainter objects ( probable gcs ) were also included .",
    "although our antlia sample is rather small , we note that the majority of the ucds , i.e. 13 out of the 15 discovered ones , have colours corresponding to the blue gc range , as well as 6 out of the 8 de , n nuclei studied in the same cluster .",
    "in other clusters , ucds cover the whole gc range as shown for instance by @xcite for virgo and fornax , and by @xcite and @xcite for coma . on the other hand , ucds in the hydra cluster",
    "mostly appear as an extension of the red gc subpopulation towards brighter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "such colour differences can be understood as another evidence that ucds have multiple origins , even in similar environments , and there is no single theory that could explain all of them @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this issue in section4.4 .",
    "fig.[cmdall ] shows the antlia @xmath333 cmd corresponding to the faint luminosity regime , where gcs , ucds , and de , n nuclei are plotted .",
    "the gc photometric data were obtained from @xcite and the rest of the data from this paper .",
    "it has already been noticed by @xcite , in an acs  hst photometric study , that bright blue gcs in ngc3258 and other brightest cluster galaxies present a correlation in the cmd , in the sense that they get redder with increasing luminosity , i.e. the currently called ` blue tilt ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a later @xmath333 study of the ngc3258 gcs by @xcite , the blue tilt is still perceptible in the cmd ( their fig.6 ) though it is not specifically examined , and it can also be detected at fig.[cmdall ] as the high luminosity limit of the gcs . in order to quantify this effect , ngc3258 gcs with @xmath334 where separated in four equally populated magnitude bins . for each range",
    ", we obtained the background - corrected colour distribution and fitted the sum of two gaussians to it .",
    "the solid line in fig.[cmdall ] is the result of fitting the mean values of the blue gcs in each bin , while the dashed lines indicate its extrapolation .",
    "this corresponds to a ` blue tilt ' slope of @xmath335 . in this latter figure",
    ", the framed filled circles show all the antlia members confirmed with radial velocities ( table1 ) , including both ucds and gcs .",
    "the empty circles correspond to the ucd candidates located in the acs field that are marginally resolved .",
    "the majority have colours in the range of blue gcs ( bluer than @xmath336 ) except two objects with @xmath337 that are located on the ` red ' side .",
    "those identified with large circles on the ` blue ' side follow the same trend as the blue tilt does ; in fact , some of the faintest ones probably belong to the gc population .    one of the most accepted explanations of the gc blue tilt is that it corresponds to a mass - metallicity relation of metal - poor clusters , mainly driven by chemical self - enrichment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the possibility of a pre - enrichment process , or a combination of both , has also been addressed with models by @xcite .",
    "the de , n galaxies whose nuclei are depicted in fig.[cmdall ] are antlia members located on our four vlt fields ; that is , not all of them are close to ngc3258 but within the cluster core . most of the de , n nuclei in the cmd share the same location , on the blue side , with ucds and gcs of our sample , with the exception of one nucleus that is blue but much fainter ( corresponding to the faintest dwarf galaxy in our sample ) , and another one that is clearly on the red side and has the brightest magnitude of the sample .",
    "this sequence is also in agreement with that followed by fornax and virgo de , n nuclei displayed at the lower panel of fig.[den ] .",
    "@xcite compared virgo de , n nuclei with ucds in the same cluster from @xcite , and they point out that there is agreement between both samples in terms of colour , luminosity and size . also in virgo , @xcite performed a comparison of the stellar population of a sample of ucds and de , n nuclei .",
    "they obtained different metallicities and stellar population ages for the ucds and the general nuclei sample .",
    "however , if their de , n sample is restricted to those located in the high - density regions of virgo , where most of the ucds are also located , the authors reported that no significant differences are found between the populations of both kind of objects , being all old and metal - poor . taking this into account , they suggest that virgo ucds may in fact be de , n remnants .    for the antlia cluster ,",
    "we find a similar agreement regarding colours and luminosities between de , n nuclei and mainly blue ucds .",
    "all this evidence points to a close relation between them , as already mentioned by @xcite , that suggests that blue ucds may be the remnants of disrupted de , n galaxies , i.e. stripped dwarf galaxy nucleus that may be the result of minor merger events .",
    "this idea has been sustained since the original models performed by @xcite and later on by @xcite , among others , until some of the most recent observational evidence given by e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the same origin does not seem to apply for red ucds , that appear to be in a minority close to ngc3258 in antlia , as we just find two confirmed ones .",
    "for instance , @xcite propose that red ucds are just the most luminous gcs associated to the host galaxy , while @xcite add a third scenario and suggest that some red ucds may be related to the remnants of more massive and metal - rich galaxies .",
    "we can not discard that part of the ucds in our sample may belong to the bright end of the ngc3258 gcs .",
    "cmd corresponding to the faint luminosity regime , where gcs , ucds , and de , n nuclei are plotted .",
    "open circles indicate ucd candidates ( i.e. , without radial velocity measurements ) marginally resolved in the acs field , while framed filled circles indicate the confirmed ones .",
    "dots are gc candidates from @xcite and open triangles are de , n nuclei from this work .",
    "filled diamonds are the mean colours of blue gcs in four magnitude bins .",
    "the solid line represents the fit to these points (  blue tilt  ) , while the dashed lines indicate its extrapolation.,width=317 ]",
    "on the basis of images obtained with fors1 , mosaic , and the acs  hst archive , as well as radial velocities measured on gmos  gemini spectra , we have studied the first ` compact objects ' discovered in the antlia cluster , that comprise ucd members , ucd candidates and bright gcs located in the surroundings of the giant elliptical ngc3258 .",
    "particularly , ucd members and candidates are selected among these compact objects , on the basis of luminosity , colour , and size .",
    "our main results and conclusions are summarized in the following .    *",
    "the antlia compact objects comprise eleven new members ( table1 ) , named with the acronym ` aco ' , whose cluster membership is kinematically confirmed with our gmos spectra . except for one object that lacks @xmath162 photometry , they follow a cmr similar to that defined by fornax and virgo compact objects , but they do not reach luminosities as high as their counterparts in the other clusters ( fig.[cmd ] ) .",
    "they have @xmath338 and colours mostly in the range corresponding to blue gcs .",
    "* we have obtained surface brightness profiles of nine de galaxies in the range @xmath339 from the fs90 catalog @xcite , that are antlia confirmed members @xcite .",
    "srsic models have been fitted to them and the best fit parameters ( central surface brightness , scale parameter , and srsic index ) as well as total @xmath7 and @xmath23 magnitudes of the different components have been determined . out of these nine galaxies",
    ", seven have two components ( a nuclear component plus a halo ) , one has three components ( a nucleus plus two components necessary to fit accurately the outer halo ) , while the other one has only one component .",
    "thus , we can confirm their classification as one non - nucleated de ( fs90 - 136 ) and eight nucleated de , n galaxies .",
    "* we verify that absolute magnitudes of the antlia de , n stellar nuclei correlate with total absolute magnitudes of their host galaxies , so that brighter galaxies tend to have brighter nuclei , in a similar way as has been detected in fornax and virgo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the nuclei have a constant mass - to - luminosity ratio , then this relation would point to the existence of a nuclei mass versus host galaxy luminosity ( and mass ) correlation , as found by @xcite in the virgo cluster . * the nuclei of de , n antlia galaxies share the same locus in the cmd with nuclei of de , n galaxies from fornax and virgo ( fig.[den ] ) .",
    "they all get redder with increasing luminosity , following a colour - luminosity relation that was first noticed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . with regard to colours , few nuclei in this sample from antlia , fornax , and virgo ,",
    "are redder than @xmath330 , i.e. the adopted limit between blue and red gc .",
    "however , this may be a consequence of the selected sample being not bright enough , as brighter nuclei tend to be redder .",
    "@xcite suggest that the processes that govern the formation of nuclei might be quite different for bright or faint de galaxies . according to paudel et al .",
    ", the nuclei of faint des have old and metal - poor populations , while those of bright des are younger and more metal - rich .",
    "the antlia compact objects ( @xmath340 ) are located at the same position in the cmd as the de , n nuclei from antlia , fornax , and virgo ( fig.[den ] ) .",
    "* by means of the ishape code , we have determined the sizes of eight antlia compact objects located on acs images .",
    "they have effective radii in the range @xmath2pc .",
    "these objects together with nine new photometric candidates with effective radii within the same range constitute our ` ucd sample ' close to ngc3258 , i.e. our most reliable selection .",
    "a @xmath341pc is taken as the lower limit for antlia ucds , where a clear gap is present in the @xmath3 versus @xmath4 plot ( fig.[reff2 ] ) .",
    "two foreground stars , confirmed with radial velocities , are included in this plot and show that point sources are located below such limit .",
    "we remind that gcs are detected as point sources on the acs images at the antlia distance . *",
    "the antlia ucd sample as well as ucds / bright gcs in fornax , virgo , and centaurus show the same behaviour regarding the size - luminosity relation . for objects brighter than a limiting magnitude",
    ", the @xmath3 seems to increase with increasing luminosity , while for fainter magnitudes the @xmath3 remains almost constant .",
    "we find this limiting magnitude or ` break ' in the size - luminosity relation at @xmath312 , though different authors set it at slightly different magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the projected spatial distribution of the ucd sample has similar characteristics as those of the ngc3258 gcs and x - ray emission .",
    "they all present a pa in the direction to the other giant elliptical that dominates antlia , ngc3268 .",
    "these pieces of observational evidence point to an ongoing merger between two groups in antlia .",
    "future kinematic studies will help to settle the question .",
    "* most ucds in our sample have colours within the range defined by the blue gcs , and only two appear on the red side .",
    "the blue ones follow a cmr similar to the blue tilt defined by the brightest blue gcs @xcite , getting redder with increasing luminosity . moreover , six out the eight antlia de ,",
    "n nuclei share the same locus on the cmd . as a consequence ,",
    "we propose that some blue ucds around ngc3258 may be the remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies captured during minor merger events . regarding the red ones , they seem to be much less numerous than the blue ones in this location , and we speculate that they may be part of a ucd subpopulation whose origin / s is / are different from the blue ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
