    "recommender systems often serve a dual purpose  they are expected to generate suggestions that users might like , while simultaneously being able to _ explain _ why a certain recommendation was made .",
    "this increases a user s confidence in a recommender system and it offers valuable insight for debugging a malfunctioning model .",
    "matrix factorization @xcite accomplishes this goal only to a limited extent , since it maps all users and movies into a rather low - dimensional space , where objects are compared by the extent of overlap they have in terms of their inner product .",
    "this limits attempts to understand the model to principal component analysis and nearest neighbor queries for specific instances .    on the other hand , in many cases",
    "users are actually happy to provide explicit justification for their preferences in the form of written reviews , albeit in _ free text form _ rather than as categorized feedback .",
    "they offer immediate insights into the reasoning , provided that we are able to capture this reasoning in the form of a model for the text inherent in the reviews .",
    "jmars @xcite exploited this insight by designing a topic model to capture reviews and ratings jointly , thus offering one of the first works to infer both topics and sentiments without requiring explicit aspect ratings .",
    "a challenge in these approaches is that the model must fit a language model to a rather messy , high dimensional embedding of users and items . in the context of recommender systems accams @xcite addressed this problem by introducing a novel additive co - clustering model for matrix completion .",
    "this approach yielded excellent predictive accuracy while providing a well - structured , parsimonious model . because the model heavily relied on backfitting and an additive representation of a regression model ,",
    "it is not possible to combine it with multinomial language models , i.e.  a simple bag - of - words representation , since probabilities are not additive : they need to be normalized to 1 .",
    "we address this problem by introducing a novel _ additive _ language description in the form of a sum of _ poisson _ distributions rather than a binomial distribution .",
    "this strategy allows us to use backfitting for documents rather than just in a regression setting , and enables a wide variety of new applications .",
    "this is possible because the poisson distribution is closed under addition .",
    "this means that sums of poisson random variables remain poisson .",
    "this property also applies to mixtures of poisson random variables , i.e.  the occurrence of multiple words .    with this approach",
    "we make a number of contributions :    we design a poisson additive co - clustering model for backfitting word counts in documents .",
    "we combine this with accams @xcite to learn a joint bayesian model of reviews and ratings , with the ability to now interpret our model .",
    "we describe a new , efficient technique for sampling from a sum of poisson random variables to facilitate efficient inference .",
    "it relies on treating discrete counts as `` residuals , '' similar to an additive regression model .",
    "we give empirical evidence across multiple datasets that pacohas better prediction accuracy for ratings than competing methods , such as hft @xcite and jmars @xcite .",
    "additionally , our method predicts text reviews better than hft , and achieves nearly as high quality review prediction as jmars , while being far faster and simpler .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : joint ] , pacooutperforms both competing models in jointly predicting ratings and reviews .    in summary",
    ", we propose a simple and novel model and sampler , capable of characterizing user and item attributes very concisely , while providing excellent accuracy and perplexity .",
    "our model , while significantly different from previous approaches , touches upon research from a variety of fields .",
    "[ [ collaborative - filtering ] ] collaborative filtering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    collaborative filtering is a rich field of research . in particular , factorization models that learn a bilinear model of latent factors",
    "have proven to be effective for recommendation problems @xcite .",
    "a variety of papers have adapted frequentist intuition on factorization to bayesian models @xcite .",
    "of particular note are probabilistic matrix factorization ( pmf ) and bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization ( bpmf ) @xcite , which we will compare to later .",
    "recently , accams @xcite took a drastically different approach from classic bilinear models .",
    "it uses an additive model of co - clusterings to approximate matrices succinctly .",
    "while the resulting model is simple and small , its prediction quality is as good as more complex factorization models .",
    "a separate line of research in recommender systems has focused on using side information to improve prediction quality .",
    "this is particularly important when parts of the data are extremely sparse , i.e. the cold start problem .",
    "content - based filtering is a popular approach to alleviate this problem .",
    "regression based latent factor models ( rlfm ) @xcite address cold - start problem by utilizing user and item features . cold - start users and items",
    "are able to share statistical strength with other users and items through similarity in features space .",
    "flda @xcite uses text associated with items and user features to regularize item and user factors , but does not make use of review text .    more recently , there has been a growing line of research on using poisson distributions in matrix factorization models @xcite .",
    "this work shows the exciting potential uses of poisson distributions for understanding matrix data .",
    "however , all of these models are left with limited interpretability since they , too , rely on bilinear models .",
    "additionally , all of these models rely on variational inference to learn the models .",
    "our work provides the building blocks for using poisson distributions in a wide array of additive clustering applications and is the first work to learn a model of this sort through gibbs sampling rather than variational inference .",
    "[ [ review - mining - and - modeling ] ] review mining and modeling + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    modeling online reviews has long been a focus of the data mining , machine learning and natural language processing communities @xcite .",
    "significant research has focused on understanding and finding patterns in online reviews @xcite .",
    "more closely related to our work , a variety of papers model aspects and sentiments of reviews @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite considers hierarchical structures in aspects and sentiments .",
    "however , in these works ratings are not considered jointly .",
    "[ [ multimodal - models ] ] multimodal models + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    recently , there is increasing attention in jointly modeling review text and ratings .",
    "collaborative topic regression ( ctr ) @xcite combines topic modeling and collaborative filtering to recommend scientific articles .",
    "hft @xcite jointly models both ratings and reviews by designing link function to connect each topic dimension to a latent factor , demonstrating improvements in rating prediction .",
    "rmr @xcite relaxes the hard link between topic and latent factor dimension for interpretable topics .",
    "@xcite considers review texts with hidden user communities and item groups relationship .",
    "jmars @xcite jointly models aspects , sentiments , items , reviews , and ratings based on insights in review structure .    a related line of work models multi - aspect ratings @xcite .",
    "however , these works often rely on availability of aspect - specific ratings , which are often not available .",
    "in contrast , our models learns sentiments in different aspects without requiring multi - aspect ratings .",
    "[ [ additive - clustering ] ] additive clustering + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our model , built on additive co - clustering , takes a different approach from classic collaborative filtering literature .",
    "our approach is conceptually similar to older literature from psychology on additive clustering @xcite .",
    "adclus @xcite argues that similarity between objects should be based on similarity on a subset of discrete properties .",
    "this perspective reinforces our belief that additive co - clustering is a good fit for user behavior modeling .    from a computational perspective , accams @xcite , described above , focuses on an additive _ co - clustering _ model of gaussian distributions and describes a collapsed sampler for efficient learning .",
    "@xcite uses a sum of clusters within a logistic function for modeling binary data but has difficulty scaling . here",
    "we demonstrate that we can successfully scale learning a sum of clusters within a poisson distribution .",
    ".symbols used throughout this paper .

    "we presented paco , an additive co - clustering algorithm for explainable recommendations .",
    "the key goal of this work was to demonstrate that the additive co - clustering approach proposed in accams is highly versatile and can be extended to texts . as a useful side - effect we obtained an _ additive _ formulation for language models , complete with an efficient sampler .",
    "this technique may be useful in its own right .",
    "empirical evidence demonstrates that pacomodels both ratings and text well on a variety of datasets . in particular , it is able to extract attributes of items , users , specific clusters , or attached to sentiments",
    ". this versatility allows one to go beyond gazetteered collections of words and use highly flexible and autonomous models that can be applied with very little knowledge of the specific language , that is , they are very useful for the purpose of internationalization of recommender systems that are able to understand a user s opinions .",
