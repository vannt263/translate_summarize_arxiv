    "recent studies on the passage of dna through narrow channels , apart from being very interesting in their own right , have been motivated by the exciting possibility of developing a practical technique to characterize and sequence dna .",
    "these single molecule experiments were pioneered by kasianowicz , brandin , branton and deamer @xcite using a protein called @xmath7-hemolysin as a pore embedded in a lipid membrane . when voltage is applied across the membrane , ion current can be detected .",
    "when the dna chain is inside and blocking the channel , the current is suppressed . by measuring the blockage time",
    "one can gather information about the voltage driven dynamics of dna translocation .",
    "a large amount of exciting data have been accumulated through such experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , another group of experiments was performed using solid state nano - pores for voltage - driven dna translocation @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "much effort was placed in understanding the entropic barrier associated with translocation of a long polymer @xcite .",
    "the electrostatic barrier associated with charged dna penetration through the low dielectric constant membrane has been recently discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is about friction : whether friction on the small piece of dna passing through the narrow channel is larger or smaller than the friction experienced by the large dna coils outside the membrane . to this end ,",
    "lubensky and nelson @xcite , assuming the channel friction dominance , were able to account for the observed bimodal distribution of the passage times for single - stranded dna . in their model",
    ", each base preferentially tilts towards one end of the single stranded dna chain ( @xmath8 or @xmath9",
    ". see figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] . ) .",
    "each peak in the distribution of passage times therefore corresponds to a particular end entering the channel first , the channel being just wide enough for a single strand to pass through .",
    "more recently , kantor and kardar @xcite and then storm et al @xcite argued that for sufficiently long dna there must be a crossover to the regime of domination of the out - of - channel friction , in which case translocation should become subdiffusive in character ( with displacement growing slower than @xmath10 with time @xmath11 ) .",
    "a new spin is added to the story by the experiment by meller and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these authors devised an experiment involving dna having a string of identical bases ( adenine ) in the single - stranded portion and a hairpin loop at one end ( figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) held in place by bonding of complementary bases .",
    "like double - stranded dna , the hairpin can not enter the channel ( a transmembrane pore of @xmath7-hemolysin ) .",
    "the hairpin therefore constrains the dna to enter the pore with its single - stranded end , as well as preventing the entire dna from crossing the membrane . in their experiment , the dna , driven by an applied voltage , enters the pore with its single - stranded end .",
    "thereafter , once current is blocked by the dna , the voltage is either switched off , in which case the dna diffuses freely ( non - driven ) , or the sign of the voltage is flipped , in which case the dna is pushed back . moreover , by making two dna samples , with the hairpin loop at opposite ends , it is possible to observe dna sliding away from the pore in two opposite directions along the dna contour , and the observation suggests that dna escapes in one direction faster than in the other .    in the experiment @xcite , by measuring the so - called `` survival probability '' @xmath12 , which is the probability that a dna molecule will stay in the pore as a function of the waiting time , it was determined that the voltage - free dynamics of the @xmath9 threaded molecules is about two times slower than the corresponding diffusion of @xmath8 threaded molecules having the same sequence .",
    "importantly , in both cases the dna was threaded from the same side of the pore ( called the @xmath13-side of @xmath7-hl ) . to delineate the underlying mechanism responsible for the observed dynamics , the authors of the work @xcite performed all - atom molecular dynamics simulations , which independently confirmed the experimental results for driven dna .",
    "the simulations also showed that the confinement of the dna bases in the @xmath7-hl pore results in an even stronger ( compared to a free dna ) tilt of the bases with respect to the dna backbone towards the @xmath8 end .",
    "authors of the work @xcite phenomenologically interpret their data by assigning two different diffusion constants for the two separate experiments in which the same dna is placed in the channel in two possible orientations .",
    "this interpretation is justified by the fact that the interactions between the dna bases and the pore are different in these two cases ( perhaps via different barrier heights within the framework of a sawtooth potential landscape discussed below ) .",
    "there is a temptation to summarize the experimental findings of the work @xcite in one sentence ( although no one made this mistake , including @xcite ) : dna diffuses in one direction faster than in the other .",
    "indeed , the observed asymmetry of dynamics is consistent with the tilt of the nucleotides with respect to the main dna chain .",
    "this asymmetry then seems easy to understand if the analogy is made with petting a cat along or against the grain of its fur ; the cat responds very differently in the two cases ( presumably because it experiences very different friction ) .",
    "another , possibly even more obvious , analogy would be carrying a christmas tree top first or base first through a narrow door ; one again encounters very different resistance in the two cases .",
    "the point is that such analogies and interpretations are only possible for the driven dna motion , particularly for the system far into the non - linear regime ( in terms of force - velocity relation ) , whereas for the portion of experiments in the work @xcite involving freely diffusing dna such analogies and interpretations would be _ wrong _ ; it is not surprising then that the authors of the work @xcite did not use such analogies and interpretation for the freely diffusing dna .",
    "indeed , for free diffusion , the friction coefficient ( averaged over the scale well exceeding a single base ) moving in one direction and in the opposite direction must be the same , as follows from the onsager symmetry relation , and the assumption of asymmetric friction would be a grave mistake . although no one actually made this mistake , including @xcite , it is worth emphasizing why an assumption of asymmetric friction would be a mistake . indeed , if we only imagine that dna ( not driven by any applied voltage ! ) diffuses in one direction faster than in the other , then we can easily build a _",
    "perpetuum mobile _",
    "( see figure [ fig : perpetuum_mobile ] ) moving indefinitely long through time at the expense of thermal energy from the thermal bath , which is , of course , impossible .",
    "in other words , freely diffusing dna , when it is already in the pore , in contrast to a ( heavily driven ! ) christmas tree through a door , must have the same friction coefficients when the dna moves in either direction .",
    "what is nice is that the experimental findings and their interpretation in the work @xcite are in fact in perfect agreement with this thermodynamic analysis . in order to make this reconciliation very clear",
    ", we immediately refer to the symmetry analysis in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] .",
    "notice that the pore itself is asymmetric ( its crystallographic structure is known @xcite ) , the dna backbone is also asymmetric ( from @xmath9 end to @xmath8 end ) , and the loopy end creates further asymmetry .",
    "this gives four possible orientations of the pore and the dna with the loop : two possibilities arise from two different mutual orientations of the dna backbone with respect to the pore ( indicated by the numbers 1 and 2 in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) , and for each of these two orientations there are two possibilities to place the blocking loop ( indicated by the letters a and b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) .",
    "this symmetry analysis , as shown in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] , is reminiscent of the symmetry analysis in the paper @xcite , except we have no electric field , but instead have loops at the dna ends .",
    "we can now say that in any one of the arrangements , from 1a , 1b , 2a or 2b , the dna must experience the same friction moving up or down the pore ; friction going up equals friction going down . at the same time",
    ", the friction in configurations 1a or 1b can be different from friction in configurations 2a or 2b , and they are likely to be different .",
    "that is why the work @xcite assigns two different diffusion constants to the two dna - pore mutual configurations ( 1a and 2a ) .",
    "by contrast , the loop itself likely has no effect on the friction or diffusion coefficient , so we expect that the diffusion coefficient should be the same for configurations 1a and 1b ( same goes for 2a and 2b ) . in other words",
    ", there should be two distinct diffusion coefficients , not four .",
    "we shall argue in this work that , nevertheless , there will be four different diffusion times corresponding to the four configurations in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] .    to explain our approach , it is convenient to adopt a terminology in which , instead of considering diffusion of the dna chain , we consider diffusion of the passage point along the dna contour . following lubensky and nelson @xcite",
    ", we consider a simple model in which asymmetry is presented in the underlying potential landscape . for simplicity , we model it with a sawtooth profile .",
    "the two orientations of the asymmetric potential ( relative to the boundary conditions ) correspond to the two possible placements of the blocking loop for a given orientation between dna and pore ( e.g. 1a and 1b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) .    like lubensky and nelson @xcite",
    ", we focus on the first passage time , which is the time it takes for the initially fully-`plugged ' dna to completely ` unplug ' from the pore . in other words",
    ", it is the time needed for the diffusing particle ( or a random walker ) to arrive for the first time on the open end of the dna , or to one end of the @xmath14 interval , provided that a reflecting boundary condition is imposed at the opposite end .",
    "we would like to emphasize the fundamental difference between asymmetric diffusion , which is prohibited by thermodynamics , and symmetric diffusion over the asymmetric potential landscape .",
    "it is well known , and we show it explicitly in appendix [ sec : steadystate ] , that stationary diffusion remains symmetric despite the asymmetry of the underlying potential landscape , thus making nonfunctional the _ perpetuum mobile _ design of figure [ fig : perpetuum_mobile ] .    in this paper , we compute the mean first passage times ( mfpt ) corresponding to cases 1a and 1b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ( or to cases 2a and 2b ) .",
    "we consider the brownian motion of a particle diffusing classically in an asymmetric sawtooth potential @xmath15 and in the inverted or reversed version of the potential ( figure [ fig : sawtooth ] ) .",
    "this model neglects the entropic barrier ( of order @xmath16 ) presented by the dna coils on both sides of the pore @xcite , but through the consideration of subdiffusion it does take into account the extra friction created by those coils @xcite . from the results , we discuss when the difference between the two times is significant .",
    "( note that since we know very little about the details of the interactions between the dna bases and the pore , we can not determine if case a in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] corresponds to case 1a in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] , and case b in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] corresponds to case 1b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] , or if it is the other way around . )    since dna translocation is ultimately not classical diffusion , but rather subdiffusion @xcite , we consider also the first passage times for the subdiffusion in the presence of an asymmetric potential . in general , the first passage time for subdiffusion was recently a matter of considerable interest and dispute in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is now understood @xcite that the _ mean _ first passage time diverges for subdiffusion , because a subdiffusing walker tends to remain too long on the place that it once reached .",
    "accordingly , we look at the probability distribution for the first passage times ( dfpt ) , and concentrate on its tail at long times . we found that this tail is very different for the two potentials , and the difference turns out to be expressed through corresponding mean first passage times for classical diffusion . with this knowledge",
    ", we construct an average first passage time from a subset of passage events and show that this average scales as @xmath6 .",
    "the result also exhibits the asymmetry between cases 1a and 1b ( or 2a and 2b ) just as in the case of classical diffusion .    from our discussion",
    "we make the prediction that the observed passage times for the four possible mutual orientations of the pore and the dna will all be different .",
    "for treating classical or normal diffusion , one often starts with the fokker - planck ( fpe ) equation ( in this context also frequently called smoluchowsky equation ) @xmath17 giving the time - evolution of the probability density @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the usual diffusion constant and we have set @xmath20 .",
    "the fpe yields the boltzmann distribution for @xmath21 in the steady - state , as well as giving the linear relation between the mean - squared displacement and time in the absence of external forces .    in calculations involving the first passage time",
    ", it would be convenient to consider the equivalent problem of first passage to either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , where the potential @xmath15 for @xmath24 is as illustrated in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] , while the potential for @xmath25 is @xmath15 for positive @xmath26 reflected about the vertical axis . with this picture , the probability for the particle to still be ` alive ' at time @xmath11 ,",
    "also called the survival probability @xmath12 ( and measured in experiment @xcite ) , is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution of first passage times @xmath28 is calculated from @xmath12 via @xmath29 .",
    "this gives the following expression for the mean first passage time @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the initial position of the particle , @xmath33 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath30 satisfies an ordinary differential equation @xcite ( derived in appendix [ sec : equation_for_tau ] ) .",
    "the solution of this differential equation for a sawtooth potential @xmath15 is outlined in appendix [ sec : solution ] . for the particle initially located at the origin ( @xmath34 ) , the mean first passage time to reach @xmath22",
    "is given by , @xmath35 for the potential in figure [ fig : sawtooth]a , and @xmath36 for the potential in figure [ fig : sawtooth]b .",
    "here , we have defined the coefficients @xmath37 expression ( [ tauclassic1 ] ) can be obtained from ( [ tauclassic0 ] ) by flipping the sign of @xmath38 .    from the results ( [ tauclassic0 ] ) and ( [ tauclassic1 ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath39 .",
    "physically , the inequality @xmath40 may be obvious for the case @xmath41 in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] , in which a particle has to surmount a single barrier in order to get to @xmath42 in case b , while there is no barrier in case a. in general , for a given @xmath3 , the potential in figure [ fig : sawtooth]a involves @xmath43 barriers , while the potential in figure [ fig : sawtooth]b involves @xmath3 barriers .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that in the limit @xmath44 ( @xmath45 in more conventional units ) we have @xmath46 , where the arguments indicate the number of teeth in the sawtooth potentials .    for the long dna , when @xmath47 or @xmath48 , the leading terms in both @xmath49 ( [ tauclassic0 ] ) and @xmath50 ( [ tauclassic1 ] ) are proportional to @xmath4 , as one would expect for diffusion times .",
    "to this leading order , first passage times @xmath49 and @xmath50 obey the symmetry in diffusion and are the same .",
    "it is in the subleading terms ( proportional to @xmath51 ) that the two times differ .",
    "let us stress that the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which is of order of @xmath52 in a relative sense , is entirely due to the boundary conditions and the situation at the ends of the diffusion region .",
    "anomalous diffusion is characterized by the occurrence of a mean square displacement of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath53 in subdiffusion ; traditionally @xcite , this is written in the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a generalized diffusion constant and @xmath56 is the gamma function . for @xmath57",
    "one recovers the usual result for classical diffusion .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this form for the mean square displacement can be obtained from a generalized version of equation ( [ fpe ] ) called the fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe ) .",
    "this equation is described in appendix [ sec : fractional_ffpe ] .",
    "although up to this point we have ignored the interactions of the dna bases outside the pore , it seems reasonable to speculate that their effect is to slow down the translocation .",
    "thus one might be able take these interactions into account phenomenologically by positing a value of @xmath58 corresponding to the subdiffusive domain @xmath59 .",
    "( reference @xcite lists possible sources of waiting time distributions leading to anomalous diffusion ) .",
    "it is shown below and in references @xcite that the mfpt does not exist for subdiffusion .",
    "this leads us to consider the probability distributions themselves .",
    "the method of laplace transforms can be used to solve for the transform of the survival probability @xcite but one is left with the very difficult task of obtaining the inverse transform , even for the case of a sawtooth with @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is shown in appendix [ sec : dfpt_mfpt ] that the long - time limit of the survival probability and the first passage time distribution scales as some power of @xmath11 and that they are simply related to the expression for the mfpt in the context of classical diffusion as follows @xmath60 @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the same expression as the mfpt in classical diffusion ( [ tauclassic0 ] ) ( or ( [ tauclassic1 ] ) ) , but containing a generalized diffusion constant .",
    "the long - time limit is reached when @xmath63 .",
    "the relationships ( [ soft ] ) and ( [ foft ] ) ultimately arise from the almost identical expressions for the solution @xmath18 in classical diffusion and in subdiffusion .",
    "the two solutions differ only in the time dependence , which is an exponential for classical diffusion .",
    "because the expectation time of a first passage is infinite , any meaningful experiment , real or computational alike , must be based on some protocol rendering the observation time finite .",
    "we argue that in essence such a protocol is always reduced to discarding the events which fail to come to completion within some specified time @xmath5 ; in other words , only those passage events that each complete within some time @xmath5 are counted . the rest of the events that do not end by time @xmath5 are terminated and discarded .",
    "conditional _ probability distribution of the first passage events that get counted under such a protocol is then given by @xmath64 for such an experiment , there exists a perfectly defined and finite average first passage time .",
    "this _ conditional _",
    "average , for large @xmath5 , is @xmath65 so far , the time @xmath5 should be long enough , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "now we argue that the time @xmath5 must be chosen such that roughly about half of the passage events at a given @xmath3 get discarded .",
    "this requirement seems reasonable , for if one discards a much smaller fraction @xmath5 becomes too large and the measurements get inefficiently slow ; if one discards a much larger fraction @xmath5 becomes too small and the tail of the distribution does not get sampled properly .",
    "thus , assuming half of the events discarded , @xmath5 becomes of order @xmath66 , just at the boundary of the validity of the asymptotics . substituting this into ( [ conditionalaverage ] ) , one obtains a scaling of @xmath67 for the average first passage time",
    "of course , this scaling is not unexpected for subdiffusion with an average displacement going like @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , due to the appearance of the classical diffusion times @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( which take the place of @xmath69 depending on the potential ) in the average first passage time we just defined , the asymmetry of the first passage time is once again present in this case .",
    "the ratio of the mfpts in classical diffusion , expressions ( [ tauclassic0 ] ) and ( [ tauclassic1 ] ) , is plotted in figure [ fig : tauratioclassic ] for a few realistic values of @xmath3 and @xmath38 .",
    "we see that for @xmath38 equal to a few @xmath70 , the difference becomes small ( @xmath71 ) for @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    ", corresponding to the length of ssdna used in the experiments by meller and coworkers @xcite , and for @xmath74 , the fractional difference in mfpts is about @xmath75 .",
    "we emphasize again that one can not use the results of the comparison between these two times ( cases 1a and 1b in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) and apply it to the experimental results in @xcite ( cases 1a and 2a in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] ) . due to the asymmetry of the pore , the @xmath9 and the @xmath8 threading of dna through one end of the pore ( the so - called @xmath13 side )",
    "can not be readily reduced to cases 1a and 1b in figure [ fig : sawtooth ] .",
    "having established the difference in average first passage times for the two asymmetric potentials , let us now turn to the scaling of the first passage times with @xmath3 . for large @xmath3 ,",
    "the scaling result @xmath4 found earlier is well known for classical diffusion or brownian dynamics .",
    "however , this is in conflict with the equilibration time of a polymer with @xmath3 monomers in the absence of a pore and membrane , which already scales with @xmath3 to some power larger than @xmath76 for rouse dynamics of self - avoiding chains @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a correct description of polymer translocation should be made in the context of subdiffusion , where the scaling of the average first passage time is to power @xmath77 of the classical result , although we do not give a prediction for the value of @xmath58 itself because the interactions involving the dna / polymer located outside the pore were not treated explicitly .",
    "the scaling @xmath6 is also not surprising if one takes the relation @xmath78 and puts @xmath79 , but it does not rule out the argument made above regarding @xmath5 , only that it gives a reasonable and somewhat expected answer . moreover , using similar arguments , the result @xmath6 is consistent with numerical simulations made by chuang , kantor and kardar @xcite for diffusive dynamics of self - avoiding chains in two dimensions .",
    "they found that the average of the first passage time scales as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 in two dimensions .",
    "they also argued , assuming that the translocation coordinate goes like @xmath82 at short times , that @xmath83 . eliminating @xmath84 ,",
    "their formulas imply that @xmath85 .    to summarize , based on our calculations for the mean first passage times in asymmetric sawtooth potentials and experiments by meller and coworkers @xcite",
    ", we expect that the average first passage times for the four cases indicated in figure [ fig : dnaporecases ] are all different .",
    "the expression for the tail of the first passage time distribution in subdiffusion is of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath62 is the formula for the mean first passage time in classical diffusion .",
    "because the power of @xmath11 in the distribution is less than two , the mean first passage time diverges . by constructing an average from the first passage times less than time @xmath5 such that approximately half of the passages get rejected",
    ", we find an average that scales as @xmath67 .",

    "<S> motivated by experiments in which single - stranded dna with a short hairpin loop at one end undergoes unforced diffusion through a narrow pore , we study the first passage times for a particle , executing one - dimensional brownian motion in an asymmetric sawtooth potential , to exit one of the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the first passage times for the case of classical diffusion , characterized by a mean - square displacement of the form @xmath0 , and for the case of anomalous diffusion or subdiffusion , characterized by a mean - square displacement of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 . in the context of classical diffusion , </S>",

    "<S> therefore we obtain instead the distribution of first passage times in the limit of long times . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the prefactor in the power relation for this distribution is simply the expression for the mean first passage time in classical diffusion . </S>",
