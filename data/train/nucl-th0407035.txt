    "the study of the properties of hadrons in hot and dense matter is receiving a lot of attention over the last years .",
    "a special effort has been invested to understand the properties of antikaons in the medium , especially after the speculation of the possible existence of an antikaon condensed phase in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion collisions at energies around 1 - 2 agev offer the possibility of studying hadrons under extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "in particular , production and propagation of kaons and antikaons have been investigated with the kaon spectrometer ( kaos ) of the sis heavy - ion synchroton at gsi ( darmstadt ) .",
    "one first observation in c@xmath3c and ni@xmath3ni collisions @xcite is that , as a function of the energy difference @xmath4-@xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the energy for the particle production ( 2.5 gev for @xmath6 via @xmath7 and 2.9 gev for @xmath1 via @xmath8 ) , the number of @xmath1 balanced the number of @xmath6 although in @xmath9 collisions the production cross - sections close to threshold are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude different .",
    "this could be interpreted as an indication of an attractive @xmath1 optical potential in the medium , although a complementary explanation in terms of in - medium enhanced @xmath10 production has also been suggested @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the @xmath0 ratio remains almost constant for c@xmath3c , ni@xmath3ni and au@xmath3au collisions for 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "this could indicate that the absorption of @xmath1 via @xmath11 is suppressed and/or an enhanced @xmath1 production is obtained because of an attractive @xmath1 optical potential .",
    "finally , a centrality independence for the @xmath0 ratio has been noticed in au@xmath3au and pb@xmath3pb reactions at 1.5 agev @xcite .",
    "a recent interpretation claims that this centrality independence is a consequence of the strong correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath1 yields @xcite .",
    "in fact , the centrality independence of the @xmath0 ratio has often been advocated as signalling the lack of in - medium effects in the framework of statistical models as the volume cancels out exactly in the ratio @xcite .",
    "however , brown et al . introduced the concept of `` broad - band equilibration '' @xcite according to which the independence on centrality of the @xmath0 ratio can be explained including medium effects .",
    "this paper is devoted to investigate the influence of dressing the antikaons on the @xmath0 ratio with particular emphasis of bringing new insight into the role of in - medium effects in heavy - ion collisions at gsi energies .",
    "in this section we present a calculation of the @xmath0 ratio in the framework of the statistical model .",
    "the basic hypothesis is to assume that the particle ratios in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be described by two parameters , the baryonic chemical potential @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the number of strange particles in the final state is small at gsi energies requires an exact treatment of strangeness conservation , while the baryonic and charge conservation laws can be satisfied on average .",
    "therefore , using statistical mechanics , one obtains for the @xmath0 ratio @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the one - particle partition function for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 @xmath19 indicate the sum of one - particle partition functions for baryons ( mesons ) with @xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath0 ratio is independent of the volume and , hence , the same in the canonical and grandcanonical scheme used for strangeness conservation in contrast to the @xmath1 and @xmath6 multiplicities alone @xcite .",
    "our objective is to study how the in - medium modifications of the properties of the hadrons at finite temperature affect the value of the @xmath1/@xmath6 ratio , focusing our attention on the dressing of antikaons . for consistency with previous works ,",
    "we prefer to compute the inverse ratio @xmath6/@xmath1 @xmath21 this expression is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : largevolume ] ) but takes into account only the most relevant contributions . for balancing the number of @xmath6 , the main contribution in the @xmath22 sector comes from @xmath23 and @xmath24 hyperons and , in a smaller proportion , from @xmath1 mesons and @xmath25 resonances .",
    "the number of @xmath1 is balanced by the presence of @xmath6 mesons .",
    "then , the particles involved in the calculation should be dressed according to their properties in the hot and dense medium in which they are embedded . for the @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ", the partition function @xmath26 is built using a mean - field dispersion relation for the single - particle energies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the dressing of @xmath23 and ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath24 ) .",
    "the resonance @xmath25 is described by a breit - wigner shape @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "finally , two different prescriptions for the single - particle energy of the antikaons have been used ( see fig.[fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "first , we use the on - shell or mean - field approximation for the @xmath1 potential in which the partition function reads @xmath30 being @xmath31 the @xmath1 single - particle potential in the brueckner - hartree - fock approach @xcite ( see l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "the second approach incorporates the @xmath1 spectral density , @xmath32 using the s - wave component of the jlich interaction and adding the p - wave contributions as done in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "this p - wave components come from the coupling of the @xmath1 meson to hyperon - hole states ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the effects of dressing the @xmath1 mesons in hot and dense matter on the @xmath0 ratio using an experimental value of 0.031 @xmath34 0.005 as reported in @xcite for ni@xmath3ni collisions at 1.93 agev .",

    "the curves representing the @xmath38 ratio tend to bend down after the initial increase when the in - medium @xmath1 properties are included .",
    "this effect is particularly notorious when the s- and p - wave contributions of the @xmath1 self - energy are taken into account in the spectral density . actually , the low energy components of the @xmath1 spectral density related to @xmath33 excitations are responsible for this behaviour ( see the overlap of the boltzmann factor with the low energy region of the @xmath1 spectral density in fig .  [",
    "fig : antikaon ] ) .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the `` broad - band equilibration '' notion introduced by brown et al.@xcite .",
    "however , this behaviour was found using a mean - field model , through a compensation of the increased attraction of the mean - field @xmath1 potential with the increase in the baryon chemical potential as density grows .",
    "in contrast , our mean - field approach does not achieve this `` broad - band '' behaviour .     for @xmath42 within different approaches .",

    "[ fig : t - m ] shows the values of temperature and chemical potential compatible with a value of the inverse ratio @xmath38 of around 30 for the approaches discussed above .",
    "the dot - dashed line stands for a free gas , similar to the calculations of ref .",
    "the on - shell approach ( dotted line ) does not represent the broad - band effect , as already mentioned .",
    "but due to the enhanced attraction felt by the @xmath1 mesons for higher densities , the chemical potential @xmath12 compatible with the value of the experimental ratio measured also increases for a given temperature .",
    "when the @xmath1 spectral density containing s - wave components is used ( dashed line ) , two possible solutions that are compatible with the ratio emerge .",
    "finally , a band of chemical potentials @xmath12 up to 850 mev at a temperature of @xmath44 mev appears , when both , s- and p - wave contributions are considered ( solid line ) . however , in the latter case , the temperature is too low to be compatible with the measured temperature and the corresponding freeze - out densities are too small ( up to @xmath45 only ) , so we can hardly speak of a `` broad band '' feature in the sense of that of brown et al . in the r.h.s .  of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - m ] we represent the temperature and chemical potential for different values of the ratio when the full @xmath1 spectral density is used .",
    "we observe that the ratio is substantially lower at the more plausible temperature t @xmath46 70 mev , being more likely around 15 for a large region of baryonic chemical potential .",
    "note that this reduced ratio translates into an overall enhanced production of @xmath1 by a factor of 2 compared to the experimental value .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the additional strength of the @xmath1 spectral density at low energies .",
    "the boltzman factor amplifies the contribution of the low energy region of the spectral function so that this additional strength is becoming the main reason for the overall enhanced production of the @xmath1 in the medium .",
    "the influence of a hot and dense medium on the properties of the hadrons involved in the determination of the @xmath1/@xmath6 ratio has been studied .",
    "we have focused our attention on incorporating the effects of the antikaon properties in the medium at finite temperature .",
    "it is found that the temperature and chemical potential compatible with a given ratio depend very strongly on the approach used for the in - medium properties of the @xmath1 meson ( @xmath44 mev and @xmath12 up to @xmath47 mev for @xmath6/@xmath48 with the full @xmath1 spectral density ) .",
    "the `` broad - band equilibration '' advocated by brown , rho and song is not achieved in the on - shell approach .",
    "this behaviour is only observed when @xmath1 is described by the full spectral density due to the coupling of the @xmath1 meson to @xmath33 states .",
    "however , the @xmath0 ratio is in excess by a factor of 2 with respect to the experimental one .",
    "what needs to be clarified is how the particles get on - shell at the freeze - out and this has to be addressed in dynamical non - equilibrium effects .",
