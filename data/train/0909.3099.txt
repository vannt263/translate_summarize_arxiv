    "establishing the relationship between total mass and observable quantities is a crucial step in deriving cosmological constraints from the growth of cosmic structure using galaxy clusters . not only can these scaling relations provide useful proxies for mass , but they are also fundamentally important in accounting for selection effects such as eddington bias and malmquist bias .",
    "the construction of x - ray flux - selected cluster samples out to redshift @xmath6 and beyond has now enabled investigations of dark energy using these data ( @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the task of calibrating x - ray scaling relations has become correspondingly more complex ; the evolution with cosmic time of the scaling relations and their scatter must be well understood , since such evolution can be degenerate with the effects of dark energy .",
    "the effect on cosmological constraints of systematic uncertainties in the scaling relations has been discussed in the context of future surveys by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "fortunately , as we describe below , it is possible to simultaneously constrain both the evolution of the scaling relations and cosmological parameters , using a flux - limited sample of which some clusters have been targeted by detailed , follow - up x - ray observations . to distinguish x - ray methods from other measures of the growth of cosmic structure , including those using optically selected clusters",
    ", we refer to the resulting data set as the cluster x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) , although , strictly speaking , it contains a great deal more information than the luminosity function alone .",
    "this is the second of a series of papers in which we address these issues . in a companion paper ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter ) we describe the statistical methods required to simultaneously constrain the scaling relations and cosmology , self - consistently accounting for all selection effects and systematic uncertainties , and present the cosmological results from our analysis .",
    "this paper focuses on the reduction of the follow - up x - ray observations , and the constraints on the scaling relations from the simultaneous analysis . in papers  iii @xcite and iv @xcite",
    ", we respectively apply our analysis to investigations of modified gravity and neutrino properties .",
    "in addition to their utility for cosmological investigations , cluster scaling relations are of significant astrophysical importance . of primary interest",
    "is the heating mechanism that prevents cooling gas in dense cluster cores from condensing into stars and molecular gas at much higher rates than are observed ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the shape and evolution of the scaling relations , and specifically any departures from the simplest predictions for gravitationally dominated systems , can provide information on the physical mechanisms responsible for averting strong cooling and star formation .",
    "the details of the cluster sample selection , the follow - up observations , and their reduction are discussed in section  [ sec : data ] .",

    "section  [ sec : mlce ] contains a discussion of the influence of cool , x - ray bright gas in cluster centers on the scaling relations .",
    "implications of our results for the astrophysics of the intracluster medium ( icm ) are discussed in section  [ sec : astroimp ] .    unless otherwise noted , masses , luminosities and distances in tables and figures are calculated with respect to a reference cosmology , defined to be spatially flat , with hubble constant @xmath7 , present mean matter density with respect to the critical density @xmath8 , and dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant .",

    "our data are drawn from three wide - area cluster samples derived from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample ( bcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ rosat_-eso flux - limited x - ray sample ( reflex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the bright sub - sample of the massive cluster survey ( bright macs ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the distributions of cluster detections from each sample in redshift and luminosity are shown in figure  [ fig : samples ] ( here luminosities in the rest frame 0.12.4@xmath0 band are calculated straightforwardly from the survey fluxes , assuming our reference cosmology ) .    the flux limits , @xmath14 , defining the samples are respectively @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the 0.12.4  kev _ rosat _ energy band . in order to restrict the data set to massive clusters , for which the scaling relations can be described simply , we select only clusters whose flux in this band satisfies @xmath18,\\ ] ] where    @xmath19    approximately corresponds to a fixed , intrinsic luminosity of @xmath20 in the 0.12.4@xmath0 band for our reference cosmology . using this selection criterion , the bcs , reflex and macs samples",

    "the bcs and macs sources selected are the same as in . ] within the redshift and flux range defined above , all three samples are thought to be approximately 100 per cent complete and pure .      additional information about a subset of the flux - selected clusters is available from follow - up x - ray observations .",
    "these observations enable more precise measurements of cluster luminosities , as well as measurements of morphology , temperature , and gas mass , which is an excellent proxy for total mass .",
    "we incorporate _",
    "data for clusters at @xmath21 where it is available . below this redshift , the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer",
    "( acis ) field of view is typically too small to allow measurements at @xmath2 , a canonical radius at which simulations indicate that the scaling relations are well behaved @xcite . for @xmath22 , we do , however , incorporate follow - up _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations .",
    "the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations were cross - calibrated using clusters in the redshift range @xmath23 that were observed with both instruments ( section  [ sec : crosscal ] ) .",
    "details of the follow - up observations can be found in tables  [ tab : bcsobs][tab : macsobs ] ; the total good exposure time of the follow - up data , including both _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ observations , is 3.3  ms , distributed over 94 clusters .",
    "the reduction and analysis of these data are described in the following sections .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : mltmore ]",
    "we stress that the limit on the intrinsic scatter above must be treated with caution .",
    "the luminosities and masses determined from follow - up observations incorporate various systematic allowances , most importantly those accounting for instrument calibration and the cluster - to - cluster variation of @xmath24 ( section  [ sec : deproj ] ) . the precise definition of these allowances has very little impact on the mean relation derived here , or on the results of section  [ sec : results ] ; however , because of its small size , the scatter in the center - excised luminosity  mass relation is sensitive to these allowances . to estimate the effect that the systematic allowances have on the determination of the intrinsic scatter , we repeat the fit using statistical error bars only ( as shown in figure  [ fig : lcice ] ) . in this case",
    ", we find an intrinsic scatter of @xmath25 , or @xmath26 per cent .",
    "we conclude that , while the definition of a formal confidence interval for the center - excised intrinsic scatter is problematic , the scatter is likely to be very small ( @xmath4 per cent ) .",
    "the small size of this scatter in the self - similar case strongly suggests that departures from self - similar evolution in the center - excised relation are also small .",
    "we test this possibility by fitting equation  [ eq : mlce ] with the additional parameter @xmath27 free , finding @xmath28 from the standard data set and @xmath29 from the extended data , both consistent with zero .",
    "the latter corresponds to a 10 per cent constraint on excess evolution in the normalization of the relation within @xmath6 ( or 16 per cent within @xmath30 ) .",
    "the constraints on the slope and scatter are similar to those in table  [ tab : ceslopes ] .",
    "the existence of such a simply evolving , low - scatter proxy for total mass is exciting in the context of future x - ray cluster searches .",
    "since the center - excised luminosity at soft energies is derived from the count rate with little temperature dependence , it can be measured precisely without the need for high - quality spectral information .",
    "this is in contrast to other low - scatter mass proxies such as the average temperature ( @xmath31 ) or thermal energy ( @xmath32 ) , which are generally limited by the precision of temperature measurements .",
    "although the upcoming erosita survey is unlikely to have sufficient spatial resolution to directly measure center - excised fluxes , a mission along the lines of the proposed wide - field x - ray telescope ( wfxt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could potentially take advantage of this tight relation to construct an effectively mass - limited cluster sample directly from an x - ray center - excised flux - limited survey .",
    "if the scatter between mass and center - excised luminosity is negligible , the dependence of the center - excised temperature  luminosity relation on the mass function ( equation  [ eq : ltrel ] ) vanishes .",
    "the parameters of the nominal , center - excised temperature  luminosity relation , @xmath33 can then be estimated simply as ( table  [ tab : ceslopes ] ) @xmath34 the intrinsic scatter is identical to that of the temperature  mass relation .",
    "the virial theorem makes specific predictions for the slopes of the scaling relations linking cluster mass , bolometric luminosity and mass - weighted temperature ; namely @xmath35^{4/3 } , \\nonumber \\\\    { \\ensuremath{kt_{\\mathrm{mw } } } } & \\propto & \\left [ e(z)m \\right]^{2/3 } , \\\\    { \\ensuremath{kt_{\\mathrm{mw } } } } & \\propto & \\left [ \\frac{{\\ensuremath{l_{\\mathrm{bol}}}}}{e(z ) } \\right]^{1/2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for quantities within a fixed critical - overdensity radius .",
    "compared to this prediction , our result for the ( center - included ) bolometric luminosity ",
    "mass slope , @xmath36 , is significantly steeper , and our constraint on the temperature  mass slope , @xmath37 , is significantly shallower . these results are consistent with a picture in which the intracluster medium has been subject to excess heating ; energy injection heats the gas , raising the temperature and decreasing the density ( hence the luminosity ) , with the effect being more prominent in lower mass systems .",
    "condensation of the coldest gas in cluster cores , leaving behind hotter , less dense gas , may also play a role , although some additional heating is still required in order to account for the typically modest star formation rates observed in cool cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , the consistency of our data with a simple , self - similarly evolving power - law model indicates that the effects of the excess heat on the global luminosity and temperature have not evolved strongly since redshift 0.5 .",
    "interestingly , when the central @xmath38 is excluded from the luminosity measurements , the slope of the bolometric luminosity ",
    "mass relation , @xmath39 , is close to the virial prediction .",
    "this observation suggests that the excess heating is limited to the central regions of clusters , arguing in favor of local heating mechanisms , such as agn feedback , and against mechanisms that would heat the icm more uniformly , such as preheating . the fact that the center - excised temperature  mass slope does not agree with the virial prediction does not necessarily change this picture , since that prediction applies to the mass - weighted temperature rather than the emission - weighted temperatures reported here . due to systematic uncertainties in the background modeling .",
    "] note also that the emission - weighted temperature is more influenced by gas at small radii , i.e. closer to the source of excess heating , where the signal - to - noise is much higher than in the outskirts .",
    "the small intrinsic scatter of the center - excised luminosity  mass ( particularly ) and temperature  mass relations over a wide range in redshift , including terms for self - similar evolution as we have , further reinforces the notion that the self - similar model closely describes the icm outside of cluster centers .",
    "we have presented constraints on the x - ray scaling relations of galaxy clusters using a new analysis method , detailed in , that self - consistently accounts for all observational biases and degeneracies with cosmological parameters .",
    "the data are drawn from three wide area , x - ray flux - limited cluster samples based on the rass , span the redshift range @xmath40 , and satisfy the luminosity threshold @xmath41 .",
    "masses , x - ray luminosities , and average icm temperatures at @xmath2 were derived from follow - up x - ray observations of 94 of the 238 flux - selected clusters , and used to constrain joint luminosity  temperature  mass scaling relations , marginalizing over a @xmath42cdm cosmological background as well as conservative systematic allowances .",
    "our analysis for the first time incorporates the cluster mass function and sample selection function in a fully self - consistent and statistically rigorous way .",
    "the data are consistent with a relatively simple picture in which the nominal temperature  mass and luminosity  mass relations in the observed mass range are described by power laws that evolve self similarly .",
    "the scatter in luminosity and temperature at fixed mass is adequately described by a simple , bivariate log - normal distribution .",
    "departures from self - similar evolution , evolution in the scatter , and asymmetry in the scatter were considered , but the data do not require any of these additions to the model at a statistically significant level . incorporating additional cosmological data to minimize the degeneracies with cosmological parameters , we find that the slope of the ( center - included ) luminosity  mass relation is @xmath43 ( corresponding to bolometric luminosity  mass slope @xmath44 ) while the slope of the ( center - excised ) temperature  mass relation is @xmath37 .",
    "the marginal scatters of the relations are @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( 68.3 per cent confidence intervals ) .",
    "the correlation coefficient of the luminosity and temperature scatters at fixed mass is relatively poorly constrained , but consistent with zero , @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting temperature  luminosity relation has slope @xmath48 and intrinsic scatter @xmath49 .",
    "the steep slope of the bolometric luminosity  mass relation and shallow slope of the temperature  mass relation relative to the predictions of the virial theorem ( respectively @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) are consistent with the now - standard picture of excess heating of the icm .",
    "moreover , the agreement of our data with self - similar evolution indicates that the heating mechanism was in operation before @xmath6 , and that its effects on global cluster properties do not evolve strongly at redshifts @xmath52 .",
    "previous observations that the scatter in the luminosity  mass relation is dominated by the emission in the cluster center ( @xmath3 ) are reinforced by our data . here",
    ", we find three main , new results .",
    "first , the intrinsic scatter in the center - excised luminosity  mass relation is consistent with zero ; we derive an upper bound at the @xmath4 per cent level .",
    "second , the center - excised , bolometric luminosity  mass slope , @xmath39 , is in agreement with the virial prediction .",
    "third , we find that the evolution of this relation to be consistent with the self - similar expectation , and bound departures from self similarity at the 16 per cent level over the range @xmath53 ( 10 per cent over @xmath52 ) . together",
    ", these results argue that the excess heating in clusters has been primarily limited to their centers , supporting local heating mechanisms such as agn feedback over more global preheating .",
    "the existence of a tight , simply evolving correlation between center - excised luminosity and mass is exciting for cosmological applications , since the center - excised luminosity may provide a simpler and cheaper ( in terms of required exposure time ) mass proxy than average temperature or thermal energy .",
    "potentially , it could form the basis for the selection of an effectively mass - limited cluster sample from a future x - ray survey , given an instrument with sufficient spatial resolution .    in this paper",
    ", we have not presented any cosmological results , despite the fact that the analysis used here simultaneously constrains cosmological parameters .",
    "those results , as well as constraints on more complex cosmological models , can be found in .",
    "the scaling relation results presented here should provide a benchmark for comparison with cosmological simulations of the formation and evolution of massive clusters including baryonic physics .",

    "the simplest way to visualize the effect of malmquist bias on this distribution of clusters is to consider a threshold luminosity below which no clusters can be detected ; this results in the `` observed '' data set shown above the dashed , blue line in the upper - right panel of the figure ( assuming complete follow - up and ignoring any additional scatter due to measurement errors ) .",
    "the distribution of observed clusters in the log - mass log - luminosity plane clearly does not follow the underlying relation indicated by the red line , and any simple method of fitting the data that does not account for the selection procedure ( i.e. the luminosity threshold ) will be biased by the low - mass clusters , which lie far from the mean relation .",
    "+      this picture is further complicated by the presence of eddington bias , which results from the fact that the number of clusters in the universe decreases rapidly as a function of mass .",
    "although usually thought of in terms of the total number of cluster detections , the steep slope of the mass function has the additional effect of exaggerating the biased nature of the scaling relation data . this can be seen in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : selbias ] , which show the true and observed distribution of cluster masses and luminosities relative to the true relation and the luminosity threshold when the distribution of cluster log - masses is exponential rather than uniform .",
    "straightforwardly , the presence of many more low - mass than high - mass clusters results in a larger fraction of heavily biased ( i.e. more luminous than average ) data .    in practice , the effects of selection bias on our luminosity  mass data are less visually obvious ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitmlt ] ) because the data are drawn from three flux - limited samples , each with a different flux limit . in effect , the applicable threshold @xmath54 is a function of both redshift and the applicable flux limit , and therefore varies from cluster to cluster . nevertheless , the data are certainly affected by selection bias , as reflected in the apparent offset between the data and the best - fitting relation from our analysis in figure  [ fig : fitmlt ] .",
    "we stress that re - measurement of cluster luminosities through follow - up observations does _ not _ eliminate the effects of the malmquist and eddington biases described above because most of the scatter in survey - measured luminosity at fixed mass is due to intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation , not measurement errors .",
    "fitting methods that do not explicitly account for the distribution of covariates ( i.e. that assume they are uniformly distributed ) will naturally assign disproportionate importance to the lowest - mass systems , whose number is very sensitive to the details of the mass function in addition to the selection function . to properly compensate for this effect , it is thus crucial that an analysis incorporate information about both the mass function and sample selection function , as described in . in practice",
    ", it is necessary to marginalize over cosmological parameters which affect the mass function , particularly @xmath55 .",
    "the distribution @xmath56 describes the likelihood of a cluster having luminosity @xmath57 measured in follow - up observations , given that it was detected in the survey at redshift @xmath58 and given that the mass measured in follow - up observations was @xmath59 ( see definitions in equation  [ eq : mltdefs ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the spectroscopic redshift measurement error is negligible , and we therefore set @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the dirac delta function ) , i.e. @xmath62 . with this simplification",
    ", @xmath56 can be written @xmath63 where @xmath64 is proportional to the mass function at redshift @xmath65 ; @xmath66 is the stochastic , bivariate scaling relation ; @xmath67 is the likelihood of measuring mass @xmath59 and luminosity @xmath57 given true values @xmath68 , @xmath54 and @xmath69 ; and @xmath70 is the probability of detecting a cluster with redshift @xmath65 , luminosity @xmath54 and temperature @xmath69 in the survey .",
    "this distribution is closely related to the quantity @xmath71 defined in section  4.1.2 of , the primary difference being that the information provided by the survey flux measurement is not incorporated into in the expression above ."
