    "the study of the transient hard tails in neutron star ( ns ) low mass binaries ( lmxbs ) has recently received a strong theoretical impulse .",
    "the first approach has been mainly phenomenological , with the hard tails simply fitted by a powerlaw ( ) model ( see review by di salvo & stella 2002 ) .",
    "subsequently , using 0.4 - 120kev  data , farinelli et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter f05 ) tried a more physical approach , describing the hard tail of by means of comptonization of soft ( @xmath2 0.6kev ) seed photons off a hybrid ( thermal plus non - thermal ) electron population .",
    "more recently , paizis et al . ( 2006 , hereafter p06 ) , using long - term time - averaged /ibis spectra ( @xmath3 20kev ) , confirmed the presence of hard emission in the z sources , , , , , and they also discovered it in the atoll source , which , in fact , is characterized by a stable z - like continuum ( thermal component with low electron temperature @xmath4 and high optical depth @xmath5 ) .    motivated by observations of the intermediate and soft states of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) , p06 proposed that bulk motion comptonization can be responsible for the formation of the well - known hard tails in nss observed in these sources as well . in their analysis , they used the bulk motion comptonization ( ) model in ,",
    "whose description is reported in titarchuk et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter tmk96 and tmk97 , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , merging their results with those of falanga et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter f06 ) on the atoll source 4u  172834 ( gx  3540 ) , p06 identified four main spectral states for ns lmxbs ( see fig . 4 in p06 ) : _",
    "hard/  state _",
    "( and ) , _ low / hard state _",
    "( ) , _ intermediate state _ ( e.g. , ) and _ very soft state _ ( e.g. , gx  3@xmath61 ) . in their picture , the relative contribution of thermal and bulk comptonization ( tc and bc , respectively ) , in turn related to the accretion rate @xmath7 and the radiation pressure from the ns , is the main parameter explaining both the different spectral states among several sources and the spectral evolution of a single source . however , the lack of data below 20kev prevented p06 from drawing more stringent conclusions on the accretion geometry of the systems and on the physical parameters .",
    "re - analyzing broad - band  data , farinelli et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter f07 ) applied the  model to .",
    "they found that the source spectrum can be described by a blackbody ( ) -like emission , plus an unsaturated tc component plus a .",
    "the tc component , fitted with the  model ( titarchuk 1994 , hereafter t94 ) , is suggested to come from the region ( called transition layer , tl ) between the keplerian accretion disk and the ns surface , while the -like emission is attributed to bc of the ns seed photons on the in - falling material , which is in turn the innermost part of the tl itself .",
    "this accretion scenario proposed by f07 is supported by results obtained by numerical solutions of the equation for the radial velocity profile @xmath8 in accretion disks ( titarchuk & farinelli 2008 , hereafter tf08 , in preparation ) , where the quasi free - fall behaviour of @xmath8 inside the tl from some radius @xmath9 to the ns surface , is unambiguously shown .",
    "it is thus evident that bc is gaining strong theoretical and observational support in the study of lmxb spectral evolution .",
    "this is true also for the case of accretion powered pulsars for which a new theoretical model based on tc and bc , occurring in the accreting shocked gas , was recently presented ( becker & wolff , 2007 , hereafter bw07 ) . in the bw07 comptonization model",
    "the effects of the strong magnetic field ( @xmath10 g ) are very important , as the accreting gas column is channelized at the ns magnetic poles and the presence of this field also has important consequences for the photons propagating through the plasma .    from the observational point of view , the energy index @xmath11 and the cutoff energy @xmath12 are only parameters which can be determined by fitting the observable spectral shapes to the comptonization models ; additional assumptions have to be adopted however in order to relate them to the physical parameters of the particular models .",
    "however in this paper we concentrate in the study of sources where the magnetic field is low , so that it has second - order effects with respect to radiation pressure in driving the accretion process . for a such class of low - magnetized compact objects , in the current  package it is available the  model , which was used , as mentioned above , by p06 .",
    "it is in fact a _ general comptonization _ model , i.e. widely applicable , given that the output emerging comptonized spectrum is given by the convolution of the analytical approximation of the _ green s function _",
    "( response of the system to injection of a monochromatic line at energy @xmath13 ) with a   seed photon spectrum , regardless of the comptonization process , i.e. only due to thermal or combined thermal and bulk effect .",
    "the  model parameters are the  seed photons color temperature ( @xmath14 ) and normalization , the energy index @xmath11 of the comptonized spectrum and the _ illumination factor _ @xmath15 .",
    "the information on the efficiency of the comptonization is carried - out by the index @xmath11 : the lower @xmath11 , the higher the energy exchange from hotter electrons to softer seed photons . as we mention above",
    ", @xmath11 does not specify which kind of comptonization process produces it , but it is simply related to an observable quantity in the photon spectrum of the data .",
    "the green s function of the model is approximated by a broken , a condition that holds when the average energy of the seed photons is much lower than the average energy @xmath16 of the plasma ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 , hereafter st80 , and tmk97 ) .",
    "the  model however lacks the electron recoil - effect term in the green s function , which is responsible for the rollover in the spectrum ( the energy of the rollover , depending on the plasma temperature and on the first and second order of the bulk velocity , at about @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus the comptonized part of the emerging spectrum is in the  model always a  with no cutoff .",
    "however the lack of the energy cutoff in the model becomes critical in fitting of the tc spectra of lmxbs in their high - luminosity state , when the rollover is well observed around 10kev .",
    "motivated by these limitations in the currently available version of the   model for   and by the recent observational results on lmxbs ( see above ) , we developed a new model for  which can be considered as an extension and completion of . in section [ description ]",
    "we summarize the main results of the bulk motion comptonization theory and show the mathematical background of our model . in section [ sources ] we show the results of the spectral fitting using our model on a sample of six persistently bright ns lmxbs . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the main results and the limits of applicability of the model itself , with a breif theoretical comparison to the model of bw07 , and in section [ conclusion ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the comptonization equation ( a particular type of fokker - planck equation , see e.g. t94 ) describes an evolution of the photon field due to compton scattering of photons off non - relativistic thermal electrons .",
    "it is obtained as the approximation of the full kinetic boltzmann equation when the photon field is almost isotropic , the average number of scatterings is high and the average energy exchange per scattering is small , namely @xmath17 . when the divergence of the velocity field @xmath18 of the electrons is zero ( namely when",
    "electrons are subjected to pure brownian motion ) only tc contributes to the total emerging spectrum ( st80 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the plasma flow is subjected to inward bulk motion ( @xmath19 ) , the latter provides a further channel to comptonization . the comptonization equation including the bulk motion term was first derived and introduced by blandford & payne ( 1981 ) . a slightly modified version of the equation , which includes the second order bulk term @xmath20 is presented in tmk97 .",
    "the equation for the photon occupation number @xmath21 in the case of a free - fall velocity profile ( @xmath22 ) reads as    @xmath23 - { { \\dot m } \\over { 2 } }    { j \\over { \\kappa c } } , ~ \\label{kompaneets}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is a dimensionless energy , @xmath25 is a dimensionless electron temperature , @xmath26 is the accretion rate in units of the eddington accretion rate , @xmath27 is the inverse of scattering free path of electron and @xmath5 is the optical depth .",
    "the term @xmath28 in equation ( [ kompaneets ] ) is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath5 and represents the seed photons source function and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the quantity of interest in the above equation is the bulk parameter @xmath1 , which is derived in tmk97 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fractional eddington luminosity impinging on the flow .",
    "it is worth noting that in equation  ( [ kompaneets ] ) , the term @xmath34 depends on @xmath5 through the bulk term @xmath35 .",
    "given that @xmath34 depends on @xmath5 it is possible to find an analytical solution of the equation ( using the separation of variables method ) only neglecting the @xmath36 term , namely by setting @xmath37=1 .",
    "in this case the green s function @xmath38=@xmath39 ( see also eqs . [ b4]-[b8 ] in tmk97 ) with @xmath40 given by    @xmath41    @xmath42    here @xmath11 is energy index , @xmath43=@xmath44 and @xmath29 , @xmath45 represent the dimensionless scattered and injected photon energies , respectively , namely @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this is in fact the _ complete _ form of the green s function for the comptonization equation , while in equation ( 22 ) of tmk97 it is reported the asymptotic case of low - energy ( @xmath48 1 ) monochromatic line injection .",
    "the dependence of spectral energy index @xmath11 on the model physical parameters @xmath49 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 is presented in equations ( 7 ) and ( 23 ) of tmk96 and tmk97 , respectively .",
    "we note that the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath49 and @xmath5 in equation ( [ green ] ) is implicit through the presence of the first eigenvalue of the space diffusion operator .    in equation  ( [ green ] )",
    ", @xmath50 is a confluent hyper - geometric function ( abramowitz & stegun 1970 ) , and @xmath51 is an integral function expressed through the formula @xmath52    given that comptonization conserves the photon number , this photon conservation law can be rewritten as the integral equation for the green s function : @xmath53    thus the normalization factor @xmath54 in equation ( [ green ] ) , which is dependent of the injected line energy @xmath45 reads as    @xmath55^{-1}. \\label{num_norm}\\ ] ]    when the energy of the injected line is much smaller than the plasma energy , i.e. when @xmath56 , the green s function is a broken  and @xmath57 ( see tmk97 ) .",
    "the emergent comptonized spectrum is given by the convolution of the green s function with @xmath58 if the input spectrum , instead of being a simple monochromatic line , has a continuum shape @xmath58 .",
    "let us consider seed photons distributed according to the law @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the electron and seed photon temperatures , respectively , and @xmath62 is the normalization factor .",
    "this is evidently a blackbody spectrum if @xmath63=3 .",
    "the comptonization spectrum is thus given by    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    given that the two integrals in equation ( [ convolution ] ) do not have analytic presentation , we have to calculate them numerically .",
    "this step is performed using the _ _ gnu scientific library _",
    "_ package .",
    "note also that in the same equation the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are themselves integrals ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ int_function ] ] and [ [ num_norm ] ] ) and thus should be preliminary calculated before putting them into the integral .",
    "this embedded integral operation is however very high cpu - time consuming , and it makes the whole convolution process very slow , for  running .    to avoid this problem , the integral function in equation ( [ int_function ] ) is analytically solved at each integration step using the _ steepest descend method _",
    ", described in appendix c of tmk97 .",
    "this method provides very high accuracy ( within few percent ) for high @xmath1-values ( @xmath69 10 ) , while when @xmath1 is close to zero the discrepancy may reach 10% ( depending on the corresponding @xmath11 and @xmath29-values ) . to better approximate the integral value when @xmath1 is low , we produced a three - dimensional correction matrix of @xmath1 , @xmath11 and @xmath29-values ( with @xmath1 in the interval 0 - 10 ) which provides a correction factor between the numerical and analytical results of integral ( [ int_function ] ) .",
    "the correction factor is computed using linear interpolation among the @xmath1 , @xmath11 and @xmath29-bounds of the grid .",
    "the same approach is adopted to compute the normalization constant @xmath67 ; for @xmath70 we simply use the value @xmath71 , while for lower @xmath1-values we use an interpolation grid .",
    "a subsequent numerical check reveals that the photon number is conserved with high accuracy ( within few percent ) over a very large spanning of the @xmath11 and @xmath1-values .",
    "following the same approach of the  model ( tmk96 , tmk97 ) , we structure our model as being the sum of two components : one represents the emission of the soft seed photons which are not affected by a noticeable up - scattering in the plasma cloud , while the other one is a result of efficient comptonization . the emergent spectrum , similarly to , can thus be described as    @xmath72    where @xmath73 ( see eq . [ [ source_func ] ] ) and the convolution @xmath74 is given by equation ( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "the free parameters of our model are the seed photon temperature @xmath75 , the index @xmath63 ( if @xmath63=3 seed photons have pure  spectrum ) , the green s function energy index @xmath11 ( see eq . [ [ green ] ] ) , the bulk parameter @xmath1 , the temperature of the electrons @xmath4 , the illuminating factor log(a ) and the normalization constant @xmath62 .",
    "the latter is chosen is such a way that when @xmath76 ( and @xmath63=3 ) the model simply reduces to the standard  model for .",
    "we note also that @xmath62 must be multiplied by the factor @xmath77 in order to express the flux in physical units ( erg@xmath78s@xmath79kev@xmath79 ) . in equation  ( [ flux ] )",
    "the factor @xmath80 is the fraction of the seed photon radiation directly seen by the observer , whereas the factor @xmath81 is the fraction of the seed photon radiation up - scattered by the compton cloud .    as it can be clearly seen",
    ", we expand the parameter set with respect to .   in principle , this allows one to extract a more detailed physical information from the observed spectra . in figure [ green_plot ] we demonstrate the bulk motion effect presenting the green s functions @xmath38 for a couple of @xmath11-values ( 1 and 2.5 ) and two different @xmath1-values ( 0 and 30 ) for each @xmath11 .",
    "the cutoff energy is higher for greater @xmath1-values ( see red and blue with respect to black and green curves related to @xmath38 for which @xmath1=0 ) .",
    "note that the photon number @xmath67 is the same for all @xmath38 .",
    "we want also to emphasize however , that our model _ is not specific _ to bulk motion : it is evident indeed from equations ( [ green ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) that setting @xmath82 and @xmath1=0 , a pure tc spectrum is reproduced , like the mostly used models  ( st80 ) and  ( t94 ) .",
    "it is also important to point out the difference between the standard ones and our comptonization model . in our case",
    "the code provides , as the best - fit parameters , the electron temperature @xmath4 and the energy spectral index @xmath11 instead of @xmath4 and optical depth @xmath5 as in   and .",
    "thus , once @xmath4 and @xmath11 are provided , it is possible to infer the thomson optical depth @xmath5 using the relations reported in titarchuk & lyubasrkij ( 1995 , hereafter tl95 ) for both spherical and slab geometry of the comptonizing plasma .",
    "for example , in the non - relativistic limit the following equation holds : @xmath83 where @xmath5 is the optical radius of the sphere and optical half - thickness of the slab for spherical and plane geometries , respectively , @xmath84=3 for a sphere and @xmath84=12 for a slab . when bulk is present ( @xmath85 0 ) , the relation between @xmath11 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 is not straightforward and must be calculated numerically ( see tmk97 ) .",

    "given that the radial extension of the tl is small compared to its vertical height - scale ( e.g. , titarchuk & osherovich 1999 , tf08 ) , so that it can be somewhat approximated to a geometrically thick equatorial belt around the ns , we assumed a slab geometry for  for all the sources but gx  3540 , whose spectral state seems to be more related to a quasi - spherical accretion . using this multi - component model",

    "it is possible that this soft emission was _ intrinsically _ absent or very weak in the analyzed spectrum of the source given that it was detected when the source was in the intermediate state ( see f06 and also di salvo et al .",
    "f06 attributed the appearance of the soft -like emission , in the soft state , to the accretion disk . instead , in our accretion scenario ( as already reported in f05 ) , the -like emission is related to the emission from the ns star surface . independently of the emission region",
    "from which it comes , the fact that this component is not observed in the _ low / hard _ state spectrum of gx  3540 is consistent with an accretion geometry where the tc corona is significantly extended and being almost spherical .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the energy index @xmath11 directly provides the efficiency of the comptonization process ( see e.g. bradshaw et al .",

    "in fact , index @xmath11 has only information about the efficiency of comptonization , no matter whether it is purely thermal or due to combined effects of thermal and bulk comptonization ( see tmk97 and btk07 ) .",
    "we try to overcome these limitations , including the full green s function expression ( eq .",
    "[ green ] ) in our model and using numerical convolution of the green s function with the seed photon spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ convolution ] ) .",
    "one of the advantages of this numerical approach is that the condition @xmath205 ( seed photons energy much less than plasma energy and green s function approximated by a broken , see st80 , tmk97 ) is not required .",
    "this model modification is , in fact , important in the spectra of high - luminosity ns lmxbs , where the seed photon and plasma energy ( electron temperature ) differ just for a factor of a few ( see tables [ fit_comptt ] and [ fit_comptb ] ) .",
    "we apply our combined thermal plus bulk comptonization model ( @xmath206 ) to the four lmxbs of our sample which shows a -like hard tail , namely in , , and spectra .",
    "in particular , we use a two-  model for these sources in which the first   takes into account the pure tc part of the spectrum ( see previous subsection ) while the second  describes both the -like emission observed at low energies and the -like emission above 30kev .",
    "we assumed the same temperature @xmath4 for the thermal and thermal plus bulk comptonization region .",
    "the correctness of this assumption depends on how the two regions are physically and geometrically coupled and whether an actual temperature gradiend does exist on the region where comptonization occurs .    in the accretion geometry proposed by f07",
    ", bulk comptonization occurs in the innermost part of the transition layer region , while tc is dominant in the outer tl and presumably in some extended region located above the accretion disk .",
    "the latter statement is suggested by the lack of a direct soft ( @xmath2 0.5kev ) -like emission in the spectra , usually attributed to the accretion disk .",
    "it is likely that most of the disk emission is up - scattered in the tl or somewhat embedded in the total spectrum , without possibility to split it as a single spectral component .",
    "we find some indication of contribution of disk soft seed photons to the tc component using the best - fit values of the bb temperature of these photons .",
    "note this temperature is significantly lower than that of the -like seed photon component presumably coming from ns surface ( see tabs .",
    "[ fit_comptt ] and [ fit_comptb ] for  and , respectively ) . particularly for cyg",
    "x2 we obtain a value @xmath207 0.2 kev , in contrast to higher values of that found by ds02 or by done & gierlinski ( 2003 ) .",
    "higher disk temperatures are also found by gilfanov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and revnivtsev & gilfanov ( 2006 )",
    ".    however we should point out that all these authors ( but ds02 ) used pca / rxte data for which the low - energy band is higher than 3 kev , whereas our best - fit seed photon temperatures are based on the   spectra in the broad energy band from 0.4 to 120 kev .",
    "the pca / rxte with its low - energy threshold above 3 kev can not in principle determine any trace of the soft component whose temperature is lower than 1 kev given that its maximum emission ( @xmath207 3 kev ) would still fall outside the pca energy band .",
    "on the other hand the disk photon temperatures of 0.8 - 1.4 kev found by ds02 is inferred using a response matrix for the low - energy instrument ( lecs ) which is not correct for such bright sources and thus ( as also testified by strong decrease of the 1 kev emission line in our data ) must be considered very cautiously .",
    "the uncertainties of the bulk - related parameters of  ( see table [ fit_comptb ] ) do not allow us to check the actual differences among them as it concerns their innermost bulk - dominated region given the presence of a few points only at high - energies ( @xmath69 30 kev ) in the spectra of the four _ intermediate state _ studied sources ( see four upper panels in fig .",
    "[ efe ] ) .",
    "however we should note that in all cases @xmath1 , through which the relative importance of bc to tc is parametrized , is of order of tens , which values are expected in the case of efficient bc , when the hard -like emission should be seen .",
    "the fact that we can not constrain the upper value ( at 90% confidence level ) of @xmath1 is not surprising because of the measurement of the high - energy cutoff ( not observed in the analyzed spectra ) is required .",
    "indeed , the most important effect of the bulk term in the green s function is to push forward the rollover energy , with respect to the pure tc case : higher @xmath1-values lead to higher energies at which the spectrum exponentially falls down .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ green_plot ] .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to provide only a lower limit of @xmath1 if the high - energy behaviour of the available data goes as an unbroken .",
    "this is exactly what happens for the /ibis spectrum of sco x-1 ( see fig .",
    "[ efe ] ) .    in the case of , and , the thermal plus bulk  component predicts a rollover of the spectrum in the energy range 100 - 200 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ efe ] ) . however , it is not possible with the present data to really confirm this prediction , even the fact that  finds a minimum of @xmath1 in the  parameter space could not be indicative of that .    in the thermal plus bulk  component ,",
    "the green s function energy index @xmath11 is , for all sources , higher than that obtained for pure tc , with the highest difference observed in . in figure",
    "[ green_plot ] , we plot the green s function for monochromatic input line at energy @xmath45=0.3 ( where @xmath47 ) , for two different values of @xmath11 ( 1 and 2.5 , respectively ) considering pure thermal ( @xmath1=0 ) and bulk - dominated ( @xmath1=30 ) cases .",
    "the chosen value of @xmath45 is , in fact , representative of the ns local environment condition under this study , as @xmath204 1kev and @xmath186 3kev ( see tables [ fit_comptt ] and [ fit_comptb ] )",
    ". looking at figure [ green_plot ] , one can note that high @xmath1-values push forwards the high - energy cutoff , as already mentioned above .",
    "it is evident that the higher @xmath11-values related to the bc region with respect to those related to tc region ( see table [ fit_comptt ] ) , are indicative of the fact that in the innermost part , for all four sources , the tc efficiency is reduced but the bc effect dominates over the tc one given that the power - law hard tail is detected .",
    "when one uses  to fit the spectra of ns lmxbs , there are some issues which must be kept in mind .",
    "let us first consider the case of pure tc spectra ( @xmath1=0 in the green s function , see tmk97 and eq .",
    "[ [ green ] ] here ) .",
    "the green s function of the model is derived as a solution of the diffusion comptonization equation , which is in turn obtained as an approximation of the boltzmann kinetic equation in the diffusion regime .",
    "this means that the _ average _ photon energy exchange per scattering is small ( @xmath17 ) and photons suffer many scatterings when traveling across the plasma before escaping .",
    "this condition holds when the plasma temperature is about 2030kev and less but its optical depth is high , such as observed in the persistent spectra of z sources and high - luminosities atoll sources ( see barret 2001 for a review ) . in general",
    "most of the ns lmxbs obey this condition , as the strong radiation flux coming from the central object acts as a thermostat in controlling , through compton cooling , the plasma temperature ( barret et al . 2000 ) .    in the case of bhcs ,",
    "the situation is quite different and typical hard states for this class of sources are characterized by plasma temperatures of 60 kev ( see e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) and optical depth a few . in this case , the diffusion approximation should be used with some care ( the photon energy exchange for scattering is not so small but the number of scatterings before photons escape is relatively small ) , and a different treatment of the compton scattering should be addressed : models such as  ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) , which use iterative scattering numerical procedures are thus most suitable to be used for fitting bhcs hard state spectra .",
    "this is one of the reasons why  ( but also  or ) should be applied preferably to ns lmxbs spectra with plasma temperatures below 2030kev . in other cases , bhs or ns in their _",
    "hard/  state _",
    "( see section 3 ) , the model can just _ fit the shape _ of the spectrum : while this may result satisfactory in terms of @xmath208 value , the output parameters should be taken cautiously .",
    "let us now concentrate on the case where bc dominates over tc ( @xmath2091 ) .",
    "the analytical solution of the comptonization equation ( [ kompaneets ] ) , for the green s function , does exist only neglecting the term , @xmath210 in equation ( [ kompaneets ] ) , where @xmath211 . whether this assumption is correct enough ,",
    "it depends on the local environment conditions close to the central object . in the case of systems hosting a ns",
    ", the presence of a firm surface plays a key role in determining the global inward motion of the accreting material . at high accretion rates ,",
    "the ns surface on one side is the source of a strong radiation pressure due to kinetic energy release of the matter , but on the other hand its mirror - like behaviour ( reflecting inner boundary condition ) is crucial in determining , at any radius , the pressure gradient due to local gravitational energy release of the in - falling material .    in many cases , these concurring effects",
    "may efficiently stop ( or strongly decrease ) the in - falling matter velocity @xmath212 , thus suppressing the bulk comptonization effect ( and associated hard tail ) .",
    "numerical simulations by tf08 show that under this conditions @xmath212 is @xmath207 0.2  c , and typical in - falling velocities close to the ns surface are @xmath2 0.1  c. in this case , for an electron temperature @xmath4=3 kev , it results @xmath210=0.6 .    in the case of bhcs , the different inner boundary condition at the event horizon ( e.g , titarchuk & fiorito 2004 ) strongly modifies the radiation pressure behaviour with respect to the ns case , and may lead the inward bulk velocity @xmath212 to get values of @xmath2 0.3 - 0.4 @xmath213 in proximity of the last stable marginal orbit , even at accretion rates higher than eddington limit .",
    "given that the typical temperatures for these states are similar to those of the ns _ intermediate _ and _ very soft _ states ( e.g. , titarchuk & fiorito 2004 ) , namely @xmath2 3 - 5 kev , we derive that @xmath210 may reach a few .",
    "the full kinetic treatment should be used to determine the green s function for this case ( see titarchuk & zannias 1998 , laurent & titarchuk 1999 ) because the value of @xmath214 and the photon energy change is not small in the bulk flow into bh .",
    "the numerical solution of the comptonization equation including the second order bulk term shows that it produces two net effects on the the emerging spectrum : it pushes forward the high - energy cutoff and makes higher the comptonized spectrum normalization ( see fig . 1 in tmk97 ) .",
    "in terms of our model parameterization , given that the high - energy cutoff is not observed in the data , we would expect that this higher compton normalization , actually due to @xmath215 , would be somewhat compensated by a higher illuminating factor @xmath15 value .",
    "the model can thus always _ fit the shape _ of the spectrum , whereas its best - fit parameters should be taken with some precaution as in the case of pure thermal , high-@xmath4 , tc spectra ( see above ) .",
    "a second issue to be pointed out is how one should define @xmath1 .",
    "the analytic form reported in equation ( [ delta ] ) is derived for a plasma subjected to a pure free - fall radiation - corrected velocity profile , where only gravity and radiation pressure from the central object are the concurring processes . in particular ,",
    "if the compact object is a bh , only gravity is present .",
    "the condition where only gravity and radiation pressure are at work holds , in fact , in the case of a _ optically thin _",
    "medium , where the radiation flux ( from the ns ) follows the @xmath216 law .",
    "however , it is known that high - luminosity lmxbs systems which show hard tails ( the six known z sources and , recently , also , see p06 ) are characterized by high @xmath7 values ( mainly inferred from their luminosity ) , and consequently optically thick environments . in this case ,",
    "additional ( and even dominant ) effects due to radiation pressure from local gravitational and kinetic energy releases , viscous energy transportation , gas and magnetic pressure , can not be neglected .",
    "the numerical simulations performed by tf08 show that under these conditions the radial velocity behaviour of the in - falling material deviates from a pure free - fall law across the _ whole _ tl . nevertheless , in the innermost part of the tl itself , gravity and radiation pressure actually dominate and the velocity profile is almost free - fall radiation - corrected like and @xmath1 definition as defined in equation ( [ delta ] ) can be almost safely used .    to strengthen this statement",
    ", we tried to make a independent @xmath1-estimation as it would be derived in the optically thin case ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in equation ( [ delta_estimation ] ) , the only parameter which can not be directly obtained from the observations is the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath217 .",
    "we find the @xmath1-values 155/@xmath217 , 145/@xmath217 , 178/@xmath217 and 169/@xmath217 for , , and , respectively . while keeping in mind the issues discussed above , the similarity of the @xmath1-values , as order of magnitude , between these values and those reported in table [ fit_comptb ] is interesting .",
    "higher values of @xmath218 would even reduce this difference .      as already pointed out in the introduction , bw07 developed a tc and bc model for accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "the radiative transfer form reported in equation ( 34 ) of bw07 is sligthly different from that reported in equation ( 14 ) of tmk97 , which we adopted in our paper ( see eq . [ [ kompaneets ] ] ) .",
    "the difference mainly arises because of the different assumptions on the velocity profiles in tmk97 and bw07 .",
    "a free - fall velocity profile @xmath219 is used by tmk97 which leads to @xmath220 and @xmath221 using the continuity equation ( see tmk97 and also tmk96 ) .",
    "this result is obtained keeping in mind that the surface through which matter flows scales as @xmath222 .",
    "instead , in the model of bw07 , plasma motion channeled by the strong magnetic field is modelized as a flow passing through a cylindric column whose area does not change with the distance @xmath223 from the ns polar cap ( see their eq . [ 19 ] ) . using this particular form of",
    "the continuity equation bw07 show that @xmath224 .",
    "in order to analytically treat ( by mean of variable separation ) the problem , bw07 assume that @xmath221 and thus @xmath225 .",
    "this direct , instead of inverse , proportionality between @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath223 would obviously modify the form of the spatial term in the comptonization equation when writing it as a function of the optical depth @xmath5 instead of the distance @xmath223 .",
    "moreover we note that in bw07 optical depth @xmath5 is defined as such that @xmath228=@xmath229 ( where @xmath230 is the thomson cross - section for photons propagating in parallel direction to the magnetic field lines and @xmath223 is a radial length coordinate ) , while tmk97 use an _ effective _ optical depth , defined such that @xmath231=1 , where @xmath232 is the photon _ trapping radius_. looking at equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) in tmk97 is evident that with such a parametrization @xmath233 but @xmath234 .",
    "it is worth noting that also bw07 neglect the second order velocity @xmath215 bulk term , which is essential in order to separate comptonization equation in space and energy .",
    "another important difference between the two models is that bw07 study the bc effect in the presence of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath10 g ) which modifies the electron cross section in the photon direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "however it is not our case , as the class of sources we consider are characterized by b - fields of order b@xmath235 g and less ( see titarchuk et al .",
    "2001 , for details of b - field determination in lmxbs ) . for such low magnetic fields the b - field modification of the electron cross - section can be neglected .",
    "however it is remarkable that for both models the green s function is a broken  in the energy band where the recoil effect can be neglected ( compare fig .",
    "[ green ] in our paper and fig . 5 in bw07 ) .",
    "also it is common for these two models that the high - energy  is followed by exponential turnover when the recoil effect is taken into account .",
    "it implies that the shape of the emergent spectrum is similar and it can be also fitted by the  models  and .",
    "the main difference is how the  index of the green s function and high - energy cutoff are related to the physical parameters of the particular model .",
    "we can consider our models to be somewhat complementary as , starting from the same physical process but in very different enviroments , they are supposed to describe emergent spectra for two classes of ns binary systems .",
    "we developed a new model for the spectral fitting package  ( ) which can be considered a general comptonization model and more specifically the extension of the previously developed bulk comptonization model ( ) , already present in . similarly to , our model consists of two components : one represents the -like seed photons which escape the plasma cloud without appreciable energy exchange , the other one gives the _ effectively _ comptonized spectrum , obtained as the convolution of the system green s function with the seed input photon spectrum .    using spectra of the ,  and   satellites , we tested the model on a sample of six ns lmxbs which experience different spectral states : _ intermediate state _",
    "( , , and ) , where a -like hard component appears over the stable continuum dominated by thermal comptonization , low-@xmath4 , high-@xmath5 spectrum , a _ very soft state _",
    "( ) , similar to the previous one but without the -like component , and a _ low / hard state _",
    "( gx  3540 ) where only thermal comptonization from a hot plasma ( @xmath186 30 kev , @xmath187 1.5 ) is observed in the spectrum .",
    "we find an excellent agreement , as it concerns fitting the tc components , between the best - fit parameters of  and those of  ( the most widely used model to this scope ) , which confirms the goodness of the code .",
    "on the other hand , one of the most important goals of  is to try a more physical approach , in the framework of the bulk motion comptonization process , in explaining the transient -like hard ( @xmath203kev ) emission observed in ns lmxbs .",
    "this is what we have done in analyzing the spectra of the four intermediate state sources .",
    "it is worth noting that bulk motion comptonization is supposed to be at work , with even higher efficiency , also in bh systems in their soft states , where a unbroken  extended up to mev energy is usually observed .",
    "we show that the values of the @xmath1-parameter , which represents the importance of bulk with respect to thermal comptonization , obtained from the fit , can be physically meaningful and can quantitatively describe the physical conditions of the environment in the innermost part of the ns systems . for three of the _ intermediate state _",
    "sources ( , and ) the best - fit model predicts a high - energy cutoff in the spectrum in the energy range 100 - 200 kev , which is however not possible to confirm on the basis of the present available data .",
    "the next generation of high - energy missions , with their improved sensitivity and extended energy coverage , will definitively address this issue . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical results coming from a full magneto - hydrodynamical treatment of the tl region in ns and bh systems are very promising .",
    "we are planning to perform monte carlo simulations where the derived radial velocity profiles for ns systems will be of key importance in order to predict the position of the high - energy cutoff due to bc effect , to be then compared with future observations .",
    "the authors thank g. lavagetto and m. falanga for providing their data on the spectra of gx  340@xmath60 and gx  3@xmath61 .",
    "ap acknowledges the italian space agency financial and programmatic support via contract i/008/07/0 .",
    "the @xmath1-parameter for an optically thin accreting plasma is given by @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the ratio of the actual to eddington fluxes at any distance r , @xmath217 is the accretion rate in eddington units and @xmath49 is the dimensionless electron temperature @xmath238 . in the case of isothermal plasma ,",
    "given that both f(r ) and @xmath239(r ) go as @xmath216 , the parameter @xmath1 is independent of r. let us define now @xmath240 as the flux measured by the observer at distance d. this is related to the flux at a given distance r by @xmath241 keeping in mind the definition of the eddington flux @xmath239=@xmath242 ( where @xmath243=0.4 @xmath244 g@xmath79 and @xmath245 is the average electron molecular weight , which we assume equal to 1.14 as for solar abundances ) and using equation ( [ flux_r ] ) we may rewrite equation ( [ delta_a ] ) as      if we relate @xmath240 to the -like flux coming from the ns , then we can estimate @xmath1 using the best - fit  parameters , by setting to zero the illuminating factor a , or correspondingly , log(a)@xmath2471 .",
    "this would indeed provide just the flux of the direct -like component of the spectrum ( see eq .",
    "[ flux ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 can be estimated using the best - fit temperature @xmath4 .",
    "thus , assuming a ns mass @xmath248=1.4@xmath249 and if the distance @xmath250 from the source is known , it is possible to estimate @xmath1 as a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath217 , which is the only quantity not directly measurable from the observations .",
