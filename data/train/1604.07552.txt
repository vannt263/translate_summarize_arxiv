    "the limitations presented by traditional electronic devices , such as joule heating , which leads to higher energy consumption , leakage currents and poor scaling with size among others  @xcite , have sparked profound interest in the fields of spintronics and magnonics .",
    "spintronics applications rely in the transmission of information in both spin and charge degrees of freedom of the electron , whilst in magnonics information is transmitted via magnetic excitations , spin waves or magnons .",
    "half - metallic materials with a large curie temperature are of great interest for these applications . due to",
    "the fact that they are conductors in only one of the spin channels makes them ideal candidates for possible devices  @xcite .",
    "half - metals also have certain advantages for magnonic applications , due to the fact that they are insulators in a spin channel and thus can have a smaller total density of states at the fermi energy than metals .",
    "this can result into a small gilbert damping , which is an instrumental prerequisite for magnonic applications  @xcite .",
    "the name full heusler alloysrefer to a set of compounds with formula @xmath7 with x and y typically being transition metals  @xcite .",
    "the interest in them stems from the fact that their properties can be completely different from those of their constituents .",
    "heusler compounds can be superconducting  @xcite ( @xmath8 ) , semiconductors  @xcite ( ticosb ) , half - metallic  @xcite ( @xmath9 ) , and can show a wide array of magnetic configurations : ferromagnetic  @xcite ( @xmath10 ) , ferrimagnetic  @xcite ( @xmath11 ) or antiferromagnetic  @xcite ( crmnsb ) .",
    "due to such a wide variety of behaviours , full heusler alloys have been studied in great detail since their discovery in 1903 , leading to the discovery of new heusler families such as the half - heuslers , with formula xyz , and the inverse heuslers , with formula @xmath12 .",
    "the latter tend to exhibit a different crystal structure and have been predicted to show quite remarkable properties  @xcite .",
    "many heusler alloys have also been predicted to be half - metallic , in particular @xmath9 has been the focus of many theoretical and experimental works  @xcite , due to its large curie temperature of 985 k  @xcite , half - metallicity and low damping parameter , which makes it an ideal candidate for possible spintronic applications . despite the large amount of research devoted to the half - metallic heusler alloys , such as co@xmath13mnsi , only recently theoretical predictions of the gilbert damping parameter have been made for some heusler alloys  @xcite .    in the present work first principle calculations of the full heusler families @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 are performed , with special emphasis on the determination of the gilbert damping and the interatomic exchange interactions . a study treatment of the systems with different exchange correlation potentials is also performed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section  [ sec : ab_initio ] the computational methods used are presented . then ,",
    "in section  [ sec : dos ] , magnetic moments and spectral properties are discussed . in section  [ sec : exchange ] the results for the exchange stiffness parameter , the critical temperature obtained via monte carlo simulations and magnon dispersion relations are presented . finally in section  [ sec : damping ] , the calculated damping parameter for the different heusler is presented and discussed .",
    "the full heusler alloys ( @xmath7 ) have a crystal structure given by the space group fm-3 m with @xmath14 occupying the wyckoff position 8c ( @xmath15,@xmath15,@xmath15 ) , while @xmath16 sits in the 4a ( 0,0,0 ) and @xmath17 in the 4b ( @xmath18,@xmath18,@xmath18 ) .    to determine the properties of the systems first principles electronic structure calculations were performed .",
    "they were mainly done by means of the korringa - kohn - rostocker green s function formalism as implemented in the spr - kkr package  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the potential was considered by using both the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) and a full potential ( fp ) scheme .",
    "the calculations of exchange interactions were performed in scalar relativistic approximation while the full relativistic dirac equation was used in the damping calculations .",
    "the exchange correlation functional was treated using both the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , as considered by vosko , wilk , and nusair ( vwn )  @xcite , and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , as devised by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite . for cases in which substitutional disorder is considered , the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )",
    "is used  @xcite .",
    "static correlation effects beyond lsda or gga are taken into account by using the lsda@xmath19 approach , where the kohn - sham hamiltonian is supplemented with an additional term describing local hubbard interactions  @xcite , for the @xmath20-states of co , mn and fe .",
    "the u - matrix describing this on - site interactions was parametrized through the hubbard parameter @xmath6 and the hund exchange @xmath21 , using values @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are in the range of the values considered in previous theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "this approach is used for the heusler alloys families @xmath24 and @xmath1 , as previous studies have shown that for systems such as @xmath10 it might be necessary to reproduce several experimental observations , although , this topic is still up for debate  @xcite . since part of correlation effects of the @xmath25 orbitals",
    "is already included in lsda , their contribution has to be subtracted before adding the @xmath19 self - energy . this contribution to be removed",
    "is usually called double - counting(dc ) correction and there is no unique way of defining it ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "we have used two of the most widely used schemes for the dc , namely the atomic limit ( al ) , also known as fully localized limit ( fll )  @xcite , and the around mean field ( amf )  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the results on this choice will be extensively discussed in the following sections .    in order to shine some light on the importance of the dynamical correlations for the magnetic properties of the selected heusler alloys , a series of calculations",
    "were performed in the framework of dft plus dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite , as implemented in the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) code rspt  @xcite . as for lsda@xmath19",
    ", the dmft calculations are performed for a selected set of metal @xmath25 orbitals on top of the lsda solution in a fully charge self - consistent manner.@xcite the effective impurity problem , which is the core of the dmft , is solved through the spin - polarized t - matrix fluctuation - exchange ( sptf ) solver  @xcite .",
    "this type of solver is perturbative and is appropriate for the systems with moderate correlation effects , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 denotes the bandwidth).@xcite contrary to the prior dmft studies@xcite , we have performed the perturbation expansion of the hartree - fock - renormalized green s function ( @xmath28 ) and not of the bare one .",
    "concerning the dc correction , we here use both the fll approach , described above , as well as the so - called @xmath29correction . in the latter case ,",
    "the orbitally - averaged static part of the dmft self - energy is removed , which is often a good choice for metals@xcite .",
    "finally , in order to extract information about the magnetic excitations in the systems , we have performed a mapping onto an effective heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an exchange interaction between the spins located at site _",
    "i _ and _ j _ , while the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) represents the unity vector along the magnetization direction at site _ i ( j)_. the exchange parameters then are computed by making use of the well established lkag ( liechtenstein , katsnelson , antropov , and gubanov ) formalism , which is based on the magnetic force theorem  @xcite .",
    "more specific details about the implementation of the lkag formalism in rspt can be found in ref .  .",
    "we also note that the performance of the rspt method was recently published in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was found that the accuracy was similar to that of augmented plane wave methods .    from the exchange interactions between magnetic atoms , it is possible to obtain the spin wave stiffness , @xmath34 , which , for cubic systems is written as  @xcite @xmath35 where the @xmath36 s are the magnetic moments of a given atom , @xmath37 is the distance between the two considered magnetic moments , @xmath38 is the lattice parameter , @xmath39 is a convergence parameter used to ensure the convergence of eq .  [",
    "eq : stiff ] , the value of @xmath34 is taken under the limit @xmath40 . to ensure the convergence of the summation , it is also important to take into consideration long range interactions .",
    "hence the exchange interactions are considered up to 6 lattice constants from the central atom .",
    "the obtained exchange interactions were then used to calculate the critical temperature by making use of the binder cumulant , obtained from monte carlo simulations as implemented in the uppasd package  @xcite .",
    "this was calculated for three different number of cell repetitions ( 10x10x10 , 15x15x15 and 20x20x20 ) , with the intersection point determining the critical temperature of the system  @xcite .",
    "the gilbert damping , @xmath41 , is calculated via linear response theory  @xcite .",
    "temperature effects in the scattering process of electrons are taken into account by considering an alloy analogy model within cpa with respect to the atomic displacements and thermal fluctuations of the spin moments  @xcite .",
    "vertex corrections are also considered here , because they provide the scattering interm of the boltzmann equation and it corrects significant error in the damping , whenever there is an appreciable s - p or s - d scattering in the system  @xcite .    from the calculated exchange interactions , the adiabatic magnon spectra ( ams ) can be determined by calculating the fourier transform of the interatomic exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "this is determined for selected cases and is compared with the magnon dispersion relation obtained from the dynamical structure factor , @xmath42 , resulting from spin dynamics calculations .",
    "the @xmath42 is obtained from the fourier transform of the time and spatially displaced spin - spin correlation function , @xmath43  @xcite    @xmath44    the advantage of using the dynamical structure factor over the adiabatic magnon spectra is the capability of studying temperature effects as well as the influence of the damping parameter determined from first principles calculations or from experimental measurements .",
    "the calculated spin magnetic moments for the selected systems are reported in table  [ tab : mom_fm ] .",
    "these values are obtained from spr - kkr with various approximations of the exchange correlation potential and for different geometrical shapes of the potential itself . for the @xmath0 family ,",
    "when @xmath45 , the obtained spin magnetic moments do not seem to be heavily influenced by the choice of exchange correlation potential or potential shape .",
    "however , for @xmath46 a large variation is observed in the spin moment when one includes the hubbard parameter @xmath6 .       in order to have a further insight into the details of the magnetic interactions in the system , we report here the orbital - resolved @xmath31 s between the nearest - neighbours obtained with lsda .",
    "the results , shown in table .  [ orbital - resolved ] , reveal few interesting observations .",
    "first of all , all the @xmath47-derived contributions are negligible for all the interactions involving co atoms .",
    "this has to do with the fact that these orbitals are practically filled and therefore can not participate in the exchange interactions . as to the most dominant co - mn interaction ,",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 contributions are both strong and contribute to the total ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "this is related to strong spin polarisation of the mn-@xmath50 states .",
    "correlation effects also have profound effects on the exchange interactions of co@xmath13fesi .",
    "in particular , the fe - fe interactions can be dramatically changed when considering static correlation effects .",
    "it is specially noticeable how the anti - ferromagnetic exchange interactions can decrease significantly which can affect the exchange stiffness and the critical temperature as described in the main text .",
    "also the long - range nature of the fe - fe interactions is on display , indicating that to be able to predict macroscopic variables from the present approach , attention must be paid to the cut - off range . as in co@xmath13mnsi ,",
    "correlation effect do not greatly affect the co - co exchange interactions ."
