    "hyperon polarization in different reactions have attracted much attention recently ( see , e.g. [ 1 - 15 ] , and the references given there ) .",
    "this is , on the one hand , because the polarization can easily be determined in experiments by measuring the angular distribution of their decay products thus provide us with a powerful tool to study the spin effects in different cases . on the other hand , it is also triggered by the surprisingly large transverse hyperon polarization discovered already in 1970s in unpolarized hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus reactions@xcite .",
    "understanding the origin(s ) of such puzzling transverse hyperon polarizations has been considered as a challenge to the theoretician working in this field and should provide us with useful information on spin structure of baryon and spin dependence of strong interaction .    in a recent letter@xcite , triggered by the similarities of the corresponding data@xcite",
    ", we pointed out that the transverse polarization observed@xcite in unpolarized hadron - hadron collisions should be closely related to the left - right asymmetries observed@xcite in singly polarized @xmath5 collisions .",
    "they should have the same origin(s ) . by using the single - spin left - right asymmetries for inclusive @xmath6 production as input",
    ", we can naturally understand the transverse polarization for hyperon which has one valence quark in common with the projectile , such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 in @xmath5-collisions , or @xmath10 in @xmath11-collisions . to further understand the puzzling transverse polarization of @xmath10 in @xmath5-collisions , which has two valence - quarks in common with the projectile ,",
    "we need to assume that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which combine respectively with the valence-@xmath14-diquark and the remaining @xmath15-valence quark to form the produced @xmath10 and the associatively produced @xmath16 in the fragmentation region , should have opposite spins . under this assumption",
    ", we obtained a good quantitative fit to the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath10 polarization in @xmath5 collisions ( where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the longitudinal component of the momentum of the produced hyperon , and @xmath20 is the total center of mass energy of the @xmath5 system . ) the obtained qualitative features for the polarizations of other hyperons are all in good agreement with the available data .",
    "we further pointed out , in a recent brief report@xcite , that @xmath10 polarization in the exclusive process @xmath21 can be used to give a special test of the picture since @xmath22 in this channel , which is the simplest one for @xmath23 , should take the maximum among all the different channels .",
    "it is encouraging to see that also this result is in agreement with the data obtained by r608 collaboration at cern@xcite , which shows that @xmath22 in this channel is indeed much larger than that for @xmath24 .",
    "it should be interesting to see whether the assumption that @xmath12 and @xmath25 have opposite spins can also be applied to other reactions . in this connection , it is encouraging that the measurements on @xmath10 polarization in @xmath1 is being carried out at jefferson laboratory@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to apply the picture in [ [ letter97 ] ] to @xmath1 to give the prediction on @xmath10 polarization in reactions with longitudinally polarized electron beams .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained in other cases for the spin states of the @xmath12 and @xmath25 needed for the production of @xmath10 and @xmath16 in this process .",
    "these will be given in section 2 .",
    "after that , in section 3 , we extend the calculations to other similar processes such as @xmath26 or @xmath4 and present the predictions on the polarizations of the hyperons ( or neutron ) in these reactions .",
    "we will also discuss the influence from the sea and that due to the mass differences between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 baryons in section 4 .",
    "we will summarize the results in section 5 .",
    "we found out that these polarizations are very sensitive to the spin states of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 thus provide us with an ideal tool to study the spin correlations between them .",
    "we now consider the process @xmath1 , and discuss the problem in the center of mass frame of the produced hadronic system .",
    "we suppose that the energy and momentum transfer in the reaction are high enough so that the parton picture can be used .",
    "we thus envisaged with the following picture . in the collision process",
    ", a @xmath29 quark is knocked out by the virtual photon .",
    "the knocked @xmath29 combines with a @xmath30 to form the observed @xmath16 and the remaining @xmath31-diquark combines with the @xmath32 to form the observed @xmath10 .",
    "this process is illustrated pictorially in fig.1 .",
    "since we are now considering the longitudinal polarizations of hyperons in @xmath0 , two points of the picture in [ [ letter97 ] ] apply : ( i ) the @xmath33 and @xmath34 that combine with the diquark from the incoming proton to form the hyperon and the remaining quark to form the associatively produced meson should have opposite spins .",
    "( ii ) the su(6 ) wave function can be used to relate the spins of the quarks to that of the hadrons . using these two points ,",
    "we obtain immediately the following : because @xmath16 is a spin zero object , the @xmath30 has to have the spin opposite to the scattered @xmath29-quark . hence , according to ( i ) , the @xmath32 quark should be polarized in the same direction as the scattered @xmath29-quark . according to the su(6 )",
    "wave function , which states that @xmath35 , [ where the subscripts denote the spin and its third component of the @xmath14-diquark ] , the @xmath14-diquark has to be in the spin zero state and the @xmath10 spin just equals to that of the @xmath12 quark . since the momentum of @xmath10 is opposite to that of @xmath16 or that of the scattered @xmath29-quark , the longitudinal polarization of @xmath10 is opposite to that of the scattered @xmath29-quark in the helicity basis .",
    "hence , we obtain , @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the polarization of the incoming electron beam .",
    "we use the superscript ( a ) to denote that the result is obtained in the case that the spins of @xmath32 and @xmath30 are opposite for the convenience of comparison with other cases which will be discussed in the following .",
    "@xmath38 is the spin transfer factor from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in the scattering process @xmath41 .",
    "this is an electromagnetic process thus @xmath38 can easily be calculated and can be found in different publications .",
    "it is a function of only one variable @xmath42 , which is defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath40 are the four momenta for the incoming proton , @xmath39 and the virtual photon exchanged in the scattering .",
    "@xmath38 is given as , @xmath46 it is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath42 which increases from 0 to 1 when @xmath42 goes from 0 to 1 . since @xmath42 is related to @xmath47 and @xmath48 by @xmath49 , ( where @xmath47 is the bjorken-@xmath50 , @xmath51",
    ", @xmath52 is the total @xmath53 center of mass energy squared ) , it is clear that we can also express @xmath54 for @xmath10 in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 at given @xmath20 .",
    "eq.(1 ) is the result obtained based on the picture in ref.[2 ] under the assumption that the spins of @xmath32 and @xmath30 are opposite to each other . to compare",
    ", we now consider the other two cases for the spins of @xmath32 and @xmath30 , i.e. , ( b ) the spins of @xmath32 and @xmath30 are parallel to each other , and ( c ) the spins of @xmath32 and @xmath30 are completely uncorrelated , i.e. , they have the same probability to be parallel or anti - parallel . apparently , in case ( b )",
    ", we have , @xmath55 and in case ( c ) , @xmath56 we see that , the results are very much different from each other . hence ,",
    "measuring @xmath57 in this process can distinguish these three different cases with good efficiency .",
    "we can extend the calculations to other similar processes such as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , or @xmath4 . as we can see from fig.1 , since in all these processes ,",
    "the produced meson @xmath62 or @xmath6 is a spin zero object , we can obtain the same relation between the polarization of the @xmath33 shown in the figure and that of the scattered @xmath63 from the incoming proton as we obtained in @xmath1 .",
    "however , in contrast to the case for @xmath10 production where only spin zero @xmath14-diquark contributes and if the @xmath14-diquark is in the spin zero state , the produced @xmath64 can only be a @xmath10 , in reactions such as @xmath26 , the diquarks in different spin states can contribute and given the spin state of the diquark @xmath65 and that of the quark @xmath33 , the produced @xmath66 can still be a @xmath27 or a @xmath28 baryon .",
    "all these make the calculations more complicated . to obtain the polarization of the produced hyperon",
    ", we need to know the probabilities for the diquark which participates in the reaction to be in different spin states and the relative probabilities for the the produced @xmath66 to evolve into a @xmath27 or a @xmath28 baryon .",
    "the former can be calculated using the su(6 ) wave - function of the proton . to do this , we note that , due to the helicity conservation , the scattered quark has the same longitudinal polarization before and after the scattering . given the polarization of the scattered quark and the wave function of the proton , we can calculate the probabilities for the remaining diquark in different spin states .",
    "the latter can be determined by the projection of the spin wave function for the produced @xmath66 to that of the corresponding baryon , if we neglect the influence from the mass difference of the corresponding @xmath67 and @xmath68 baryons .    to show how these calculations are carried out , we now take @xmath60 as an explicit example . in this reaction",
    ", the scattered quark has to be a @xmath69 quark .",
    "we recall that the su(6 ) wave function for proton is , @xmath70,\\ ] ] where we use the up or down arrow to denote the helicity `` @xmath71 '' or `` @xmath72 '' state .",
    "we now consider the case where the scattered @xmath73 quark is in the helicity @xmath71 state .",
    "we see that if the incoming proton is in the helicity `` @xmath71 '' state , the remaining @xmath74-diquark should be in the @xmath75 state , and the relative weight is @xmath76 .",
    "the incoming proton can also be in the helicity `` @xmath72 '' state .",
    "the corresponding wave function can be obtained by reversing the spins of the quarks in eq.(5 ) . in this case , since the scattered @xmath73 is in the helicity `` @xmath71 '' state , the remaining @xmath74-diquark should be in the @xmath77 state , and the relative weight is @xmath78 .",
    "hence , we obtain that , if the the scattered @xmath73 quark is in the helicity `` @xmath71 '' state , the @xmath74-diquark can be in @xmath79 and @xmath80 state , and the relative probabilities are @xmath76 and @xmath78 respectively .    next , we consider that the produced @xmath74-diquark combine together with a @xmath32 quark to form a @xmath81 or a @xmath82 .",
    "we first consider the case ( a ) that @xmath32 and @xmath83 have opposite spins .",
    "since the @xmath32 should be polarized in the same direction as the scattered @xmath73 and moves in the opposite direction of the scattered @xmath73 , it should be in the helicity `` @xmath72 '' state .",
    "we consider the case that the @xmath74-diquark is in the state @xmath75 .",
    "the spin state of the produced @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 .",
    "the projections of this state @xmath85 to the su(6 ) wave function of @xmath58 and that of @xmath86 are @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "we thus obtain the relative probabilities for the production of these two hyperons in this case are @xmath76 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the results in other cases can be obtained in the same way . the results in case ( c ) are shown in tables 1 - 3 for the different reactions .",
    "those in case ( a ) and ( b ) can also be read out from the tables by looking only at the results for @xmath89 or @xmath90 respectively .    from tables 1 - 3 , we can calculate the hyperon polarizations in different cases for the spin states of @xmath32 and @xmath30 .",
    "the results are shown in table 4 .",
    "we see that the produced @xmath91 , @xmath81 and @xmath59 are all polarized significantly .",
    "we also see that , similar to @xmath10 in @xmath92 , the polarizations for @xmath59 in @xmath93 obtained in the three cases differ quite significantly from each other .",
    "but the differences between the results for @xmath91 , @xmath81 are not so significant .",
    "hence , to distinguish between the three cases , we should study @xmath54 and @xmath94 in the corresponding reactions .",
    "we note that although the polarization of @xmath91 can not be measured but it implies a polarization of @xmath10 , @xmath95 in @xmath96 which can be measured experimentally .",
    "we should emphasize that the results in table 4 are obtained under the following two assumptions and/or approximations : ( 1 ) only valence quarks are taken into account in the scattering of @xmath39 with @xmath44 while the sea contribution is neglected ; ( 2 ) the influence of the mass differences between the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 baryons on the relative production rates are neglected . in practice ,",
    "both of them should be taken into account .",
    "we now discuss their influences on the polarization results obtained above .",
    "it is clear that , in deeply inelastic @xmath53-scattering , the exchanged virtual photon @xmath97 can also be absorbed by a sea - quark or an anti - sea - quark .",
    "however , since we consider only the exclusive reactions @xmath0 or the @xmath98 process @xmath99 , both of produced hadrons have very large momentum fractions in the center of mass frame of the hadronic system .",
    "the sea contributions to such process should be very small . to see this , we take @xmath1 as an explicit example . besides the case shown in fig.1",
    ", this process can also happen via the absorption of the @xmath97 by a @xmath30 from the sea of the proton .",
    "after the absorption , the @xmath30 flies in the direction of the @xmath97 while the rest of the proton moves in the opposite direction .",
    "this @xmath30 may pick up a valence @xmath29 from the proton and combine into a @xmath16 which flies in the direction of the @xmath30 while the rest of the proton combines together into a @xmath10 .",
    "since the valence quark @xmath29 usually takes a relatively large fraction of the momentum of the proton , the probability for this to happen should be small in particular at high energies .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the probability for the virtual photon to be absorbed by @xmath30 to that by @xmath29 is given by @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "at , e.g. , the cebaf energies , it is only of the order of @xmath101 .",
    "hence we expect that the sea contribution should be negligible .",
    "in contrast , there should be some influences from the mass differences of the @xmath27 and the @xmath28 baryons .",
    "the relative production weights have to be influenced by such mass differences .",
    "however , it is very interesting to note that in case ( a ) , there is completely no influence from the mass difference on the hyperon polarizations in all the reactions discussed above and the @xmath10 polarizations in all the three cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are not influenced by the mass effect .",
    "this is because in case ( a ) , only @xmath102 contributes to the production of @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "it always gives rise to @xmath103 , @xmath104 or @xmath105 , i.e. completely negatively polarized @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "the mass effect can affect the production rate , but does not influence the polarization in the corresponding exclusive reaction . for @xmath10 production",
    ", only @xmath106 contributes to @xmath10 production and it contributes only to @xmath10 production , so the @xmath10 polarization in all cases are not influenced by such mass effect .    in cases",
    "( b ) and ( c ) , there are indeed some influences from the mass difference on the polarizations of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath59 . to see how large they may influence the polarization of the hyperons ,",
    "we multiply the production rate by a corresponding exponential factor @xmath109 for the production of each baryon , where @xmath110 is the mass of the hyperon .",
    "we assume that the production processes can be treated as two steps , i.e. , first the production of the corresponding quarks states then the evolution to the corresponding baryons . in this way",
    ", we need to normalize the production weights of the produced baryons to the total production weight of the corresponding quark states .",
    "we obtain that the above polarization should be modified into the following . in case",
    "( b ) , we have @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 similarly , in case ( c ) , we have @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 to get a feeling of how strongly they depend on @xmath117 , we show the results in case ( b ) as functions of @xmath117 in fig.2 .",
    "we see that there are indeed some influences on @xmath58 or @xmath59 polarization in the corresponding reactions but the influences are not very large .",
    "the following point should be noted here .",
    "all the polarizations obtained above are functions of only one variable @xmath42 .",
    "they are independent of the energies under the condition that the energies are high enough that the parton picture can be used .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the polarizations of the baryons in the exclusive processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath118 with longitudinally polarized electron beams .",
    "we used the picture proposed in [ [ letter97 ] ] , where it is assumed that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 needed in these processes to combine with the valence - diquark and struck quark to form the hyperons and the associated produced meson have the opposite spins .",
    "the results show that all these baryons are longitudinally polarized and the polarizations are functions of only one variable @xmath42 .",
    "we compared the results with those obtained in other possible cases for the spin states of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we found out that the magnitudes of hyperon polarizations are considerably large in all the different cases and that they are quite different from each other .",
    "hence , they can be used as a good probe to study the spin correlations between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 in future experiments .",
