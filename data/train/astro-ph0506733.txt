    "in this paper we continue our reconnaissance of the solar neighborhood by reporting results of the second phase of our supercosmos - recons ( scr ) search for new high proper motion ( hpm ) objects in the southern sky . in paper xii of the solar neighborhood series @xcite , we presented results for the portion of the sky between declinations @xmath690@xmath7 and @xmath647@xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we cover the region from declinations @xmath647@xmath7 to 00@xmath7 .",
    "recently , the northern sky has been searched systematically for hpm objects by l ' epine et al .",
    "@xcite utilizing superblink , which has been particularly successful at filling in the distribution of hpm objects along the galactic plane .",
    "their latest compendium @xcite includes 61977 hpm objects with @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath215 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the total number of objects is roughly double what was found during the pioneering days of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "historically , however , the southern sky has been investigated with limited depth for hpm objects , which are notoriously good nearby star candidates .    since the giclas and luyten efforts , significant numbers of hpm stars have been found , primarily because of the advent of large databases holding data from digitized photographic plates .",
    "some of the new discoveries are remarkably nearby , including so 0253 + 1652 @xcite , denis 1048 - 3956 , and scr 1845 - 6357 @xcite , which have distances estimated to be 3.7 , 4.5 , and 4.6 pc , respectively @xcite .",
    "because of their proximity , these three red dwarfs are high priority targets in our trigonometric parallax program , ctiopi ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation ) being carried out in chile @xcite . as is the case for all of the recent hpm surveys , the new scr discoveries are primarily red dwarfs that are underrepresented in current compendia of solar neighborhood membership lists because of their intrinsic faintness @xcite .",
    "additional smatterings of white dwarfs and subdwarfs are also found in the scr and other hpm searches .",
    "the classic work of giclas and luyten has been complemented by the recent hpm surveys summarized in table  [ pm - surveys ] , each of which has revealed important new hpm objects ( the machine selected catalog of 11289 objects generated by remains difficult to assess because our initial checks indicate that many of the objects are previously known and several are not real hpm sources ) .",
    "we compare the number of new discoveries from each survey to the luyten half second catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lhs ) , which included 3602 objects with proper motions in excess of 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 , and still accounts for 87% of all known such objects .",
    "this reveals the enormous impact of the work by giclas and luyten , who carried out their surveys in times before massive computer searches of digitized photographic plates were possible .",
    "to reveal new hpm objects , we mine the supercosmos database developed and maintained at the royal observatory in edinburgh , scotland .",
    "papers viii @xcite , x @xcite , and xii @xcite in this series include previous discoveries from our scr survey .",
    "the search techniques utilized here are identical to those in @xcite , where a full discussion can be found .",
    "briefly , we utilize the supercosmos sky survey to reveal previously unknown hpm objects using a combination of astrometric and photometric information from the four photographic plates available ( @xmath10 , @xmath11@xmath12 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 ) in the southern sky .    in paper xii",
    ", 1424 candidate objects were found having 10@xmath20 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 and brighter than @xmath8 @xmath5 16.5 . in this portion of the search , we have found an additional 3879 candidates meeting the same criteria .",
    "the combined coverage of the two portions of the survey includes 46% of the entire sky , and 92% of the southern sky , where we have searched from the south celestial pole at @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath690@xmath7 to a northern cutoff at precisely @xmath4 @xmath5 00@xmath7 ( even though the plates typically extend to @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath143.0@xmath7 ) .",
    "figure  [ pltfields ] is a map of the sky coverage , including the 894 plate fields in the southern sky .",
    "seventy - one fields have not been searched because of crowding near the galactic plane or magellanic clouds , or a limited spread in epochs for available plates .",
    "the vetting of candidates , which includes checks of proper motions , magnitudes , colors , and image ellipticities , as well as inspection by eye , was described in detail in paper xii . for each candidate that appeared to be a real object ,",
    "coordinates were carefully cross - checked with the nltt catalog , the simbad database , and recent hpm publications ( see table  [ pm - surveys ] ) to see if it was a known object .",
    "if the coordinates agreed to within a few arcminutes and the magnitudes and proper motions were consistent , the detection was considered previously known . in a few cases , the coordinates and proper motions agreed well , but the magnitudes did not .",
    "these objects were revealed to be new wide common proper motion companions to previously known proper motion stars  four new companions are reported here ( see @xmath15 5.5 ) .",
    "overall , the hit rate for new hpm objects decreases with increasing proper motion because reliable source association between different epochs is more difficult for fast - moving sources . for objects with 10@xmath20 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1",
    "1@xmath20 yr@xmath3 , only 10% turn out to be real , whereas 87% of objects detected with 1@xmath20 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 are real .",
    "these fractions include both new and known objects .",
    "the final count of real , distinct , new systems with 10@xmath20 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 and brighter than @xmath8 @xmath5 16.5 found between @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath647@xmath7 and 00@xmath7 is 152 .",
    "finder charts are given at the end of this paper in figure  [ finders ] for all of the new systems reported here , as well as for the four new wide companions .",
    "we continue using our naming convention , `` scr '' for objects discovered during the survey .",
    "a primary goal of the scr effort is to further complete the lhs catalogue for stars with @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 .",
    "our extension of the cutoff to @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 in this survey is to ensure that no known lhs stars were missed due to proper motion measurement errors for objects very near the 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 limit . of the 299 new scr systems found to date , 148 have @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ surveys ] provides a map of new systems with @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 , including the 148 total scr systems ( solid triangles representing 150 individual objects ) that are additions to the lhs sample .",
    "@xcite have completed work on the entire northern sky using superblink and are so far the most productive survey for revealing new objects with @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 .",
    "although we avoid the galactic plane and magellanic clouds , the scr survey has the most uniform sky coverage for southern hemisphere searches , and is consequently the most productive survey in the south .",
    "there are undoubtedly objects remaining to be discovered along the crowded galactic plane in the south  the gaps in figure  [ surveys ] typically match the regions not searched ( white spaces in figure  [ pltfields ] ) . the same is true of the lmc ( @xmath16 @xmath5 05:30h , @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath668@xmath7 ) and smc ( @xmath16 @xmath5 01:00h , @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath673@xmath7 ) regions .",
    "there are 1462 lhs stars in the lhs catalogue brighter than a photographic r magnitude ( r@xmath17 ) of 16.5 in the southern sky . of",
    "the 1152 known lhs stars in the southern sky with 10.0 @xmath18 r@xmath17 @xmath18 16.5 , we have recovered 1032 ( 90% ) .",
    "we recover only 234 of 310 ( 75% ) of lhs stars brighter than r @xmath5 10.0 because the search is somewhat less sensitive to bright objects that are saturated in the photographic emulsions .",
    "this recovery rate is somewhat less successful for stars moving faster than 1@xmath20 yr@xmath3 ( 199 of 251 , 79% ) than for stars with @xmath19 0@xmath251@xmath20 yr@xmath3 ( 1067 of 1211 , 88% ) .",
    "as in paper xii , coordinates , proper motions , and plate magnitudes have been extracted from supercosmos for the new hpm systems .",
    "these data are listed in table  [ scr - tbl ] for objects in the new portion of sky searched here .",
    "coordinates are for epoch and equinox j2000 .",
    "errors in the coordinates are typically @xmath20 0@xmath23 , and errors in the proper motions are given .",
    "errors in position angle are usually @xmath20 0.1@xmath7 .",
    "photometric magnitudes are given for three sets of plates  @xmath10 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 .",
    "magnitude errors are @xmath210.3 mag or better for @xmath22 @xmath9 15 and actually get larger at brighter magnitudes due to systematic errors @xcite .",
    "a few plate magnitude values are missing because of blending problems that preclude accurate magnitude determinations .",
    "infrared photometry has been used to extend the color baseline , which allows more accurate photometric distance estimates for red dwarfs and permits a reliable separation of the white and red dwarfs .",
    "the infrared @xmath23 photometry has been extracted from 2mass via aladin .",
    "each scr object has been identified by eye to ensure that no extracted magnitudes are in error . in nearly every case ,",
    "the errors are smaller than 0.03 mag .",
    "exceptions include objects with @xmath24 @xmath9 15 , @xmath25 @xmath9 14.5 , and @xmath26 @xmath9 14 , where the errors are 0.05 mag or greater .",
    "in one case , scr 1246 - 1236 , the error is null for @xmath26 , and the value is therefore unreliable .",
    "illustrated in figure  [ colmag ] is a color - apparent magnitude diagram which compares new scr objects ( split into large solid points representing objects with @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 and small solid points representing objects with 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 ) to previously known stars having @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 . as in paper xii ,",
    "the scr discoveries are generally fainter and redder than the bulk of the known stars ( note that the open / closed symbols have been exchanged relative to paper xii for clarity in this figure ) .",
    "however , the portion of sky searched in this paper is much larger ( 2.2 times the area ) than that targeted in paper xii and overlaps the regions searched by giclas and luyten .",
    "this results in two important differences from the similar figure 4 in paper xii . first , there are far more known objects shown here than in the deep southern sky .",
    "second , because luyten s bruce proper motion survey for the sky south of @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath633@xmath7 had a relatively bright limit ( @xmath2715.5 ) and lacked red plates , there were very few known faint stars in the complementary figure of paper xii . here",
    "there are many faint stars from the overlap region between @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath633@xmath7 to 00@xmath7 where earlier searches did have faint limits .",
    "note also that there are 43 white dwarfs here ( 39 known and 4 new candidates ) , whereas there were 16 in paper xii , entirely consistent with a uniform white dwarf distribution on the sky given the ratio of sky areas searched .",
    "we have not found any additional extremely red objects like scr 1845 - 6357 [ @xmath28 @xmath5 7.79 , @xmath8 @xmath5 16.33 , @xcite ; @xmath29 @xmath5 8.89 , m8.5v , distance estimate 4.6 pc , @xcite ; trigonometric parallax 282 @xmath20 23 mas , @xcite ] in this portion of the sky . instead , the remarkable find is scr 0640 - 0552 with @xmath28",
    "@xmath5 1.95 , @xmath8 @xmath5 8.79 , and a distance estimated here to be 8.5 pc , assuming it is single ( see @xmath15 5.5 ) .",
    "that such a bright object remained unidentified until this survey is surprising , indicating yet again that there may be very nearby , relatively bright stars that have not yet been found .",
    "as noticed in paper xii , there is not a significant drop in the number of objects at our adopted faint limit , so there is likely to remain a large population of fainter objects yet to be discovered in the supercosmos data .",
    "moreover , the population of objects with @xmath0 @xmath18 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 has barely been investigated , although a portion of the previously known objects in the nltt have been examined @xcite .      shown in figure  [ redpromo ] is the reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram for objects from the region of sky reported here .",
    "the rpm diagram is used to separate effectively the white dwarfs from main sequence stars , as well as to assist in identifying subdwarfs .",
    "the assumption is , of course , that proper motion is directly related to distance .",
    "a complementary plot can be found in figure 5 of paper xii for the southernmost portion of the scr survey .    as in paper xii it is apparent that most of the new scr stars are main sequence red dwarfs , while there is a substantial sample of new subdwarf candidates  note the bifurcated population of round points running from the upper left to lower right in figure  [ redpromo ] ; the area just above the dotted line maps out the subdwarf region .",
    "the dotted line represents a somewhat arbitrary boundary between the subdwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "there are four clear white dwarf candidates , two of which are confirmed white dwarfs ( solid triangles )  for one we have a confirmation spectrum , and the other is a common proper motion companion to a star of known distance .      the combination of the @xmath10 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 plate magnitudes and @xmath23 photometry from 2mass allows us to estimate distances to main sequence stars , as described in @xcite .",
    "the six magnitudes provide 15 color ",
    "m@xmath30 combinations , 11 of which can be used to estimate individual distances ( @xmath23only colors are not used because of limited color discrimination , and @xmath31 is not sensitive to absolute magnitude for cooler dwarfs ) .",
    "the relations assume that the objects are single , main sequence , dwarfs of types @xmath21k0v to m9v .",
    "the distances have an average error of 26% , determined by running the recons 10 pc sample of single red dwarfs with known distances through the suite of photometric distance relations . for our investigation ,",
    "the most interesting stars are those that are potentially nearby , specifically within the volumes defined by the recons 10 pc and the cns ( catalog of nearby stars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nstars ( nearby stars ) samples ( horizons at 25 pc ) .",
    "distance estimates for the 152 new systems in the portion of the sky searched here are given in final column of table  [ scr - tbl ] . if only one color was available for a distance estimate , no distance",
    "is reported because the single color falling within the bounds of the relations is possibly aberrant .",
    "two of the systems , scr 0640 - 0552 and scr 0740 - 4257 , are new candidates for the 10 pc sample , and an additional 23 systems are estimated to be between 10 and 25 pc .    there are 9 scr stars having distance estimates in excess of 200 pc ( excluding white dwarf candidates ) , and several more with distance estimates very close to 200 pc , most of which fall blueward of the majority of scr stars in figure  [ redpromo ] . these are presumably k and m type subdwarfs .",
    "a sample of 64 potential scr red subdwarfs from paper xii and this paper is listed in its entirety in table  [ subdwarfs ] .",
    "these have been selected by identifying stars in figure  [ redpromo ] ( and the twin figure in paper xii ) with @xmath32 1.0 and having @xmath33 within 4.0 mag of the dashed line separating the white dwarfs from the subdwarfs .",
    "all of these have distances estimated to be 90 pc or greater , but they are , in fact , likely to be much closer than estimated ( i.e. the distances are incorrect ) , so their distance estimates are bracketed in table  [ scr - tbl ] to distinguish them from presumed dwarfs whose distance estimates are plausibly accurate . in the same regions in figure  [ redpromo ] and the complimentary figure in paper xii , there are 255 red subdwarf candidates from previous proper motion searches .",
    "thus , we have made a 25% increase to the red subdwarf candidate pool in the southern sky .",
    "future spectroscopic efforts will reveal whether or not these candidates are true low metallicity red subdwarfs and allow us to continue building a sizeable sample of these rare interlopers to the solar neighborhood , very few of which have accurate parallaxes , photometry , and spectral types .",
    "six of the scr stars reported here have no distance estimates , usually because their colors are too blue for the photometric distance relations . scr 0927 - 4137 , scr 1811 - 4239 , and scr 1857 - 4309 are possibly early type subdwarfs , and scr 1800 - 0431b is a companion with blended plate photometry ( see @xmath15 5.5 ) .",
    "the remaining two stars , scr 0818 - 3110 and scr 1246 - 1236 are white dwarf candidates .",
    "both lie solidly in the white dwarf region of figure  [ redpromo ] .",
    "two additional scr stars , scr 0125 - 4545 and scr 0753 - 2524 ( a companion to ltt 2976 ) also fall clearly in the white dwarf region of figure  [ redpromo ] and have the largest distance estimates presented here ( 516 pc and 365 pc , respectively ) .",
    "these objects have colors that are within the color ranges of the photometric distance relations but are presumably white dwarfs with erroneous distance estimates , hence the brackets in table  [ scr - tbl ] . two additional objects",
    " scr 1227 - 4541 and scr 1916 - 3638  are near the dotted line dividing the probable white dwarf and subdwarf regions .",
    "we have preliminary ccd @xmath34 photometry indicating that these two objects are unlikely to be single white dwarfs .    of the four white dwarf candidates ,",
    "we have so far obtained spectroscopy on only scr 1246 - 1236 and confirm it to be a white dwarf .",
    "another candidate ( scr 0753 - 2524 ) is a companion to a star of known distance ( thereby ruling it out as a more distant early - type dwarf ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations for all white dwarf candidates are desired for definitive confirmation .",
    "spectra for scr 1246 - 1236 as well as for a handful of the objects labeled with open triangles in figure  [ redpromo ] as `` known '' objects that we have confirmed to be white dwarfs for the first time will be presented in a future publication .",
    "using the single color linear fit of @xcite and their error of 20% for distances , we estimate the following distances for the four white dwarf candidates reported in this paper : 24.7 @xmath20 4.9 pc for scr 0125 - 4545 , 16.2 @xmath20 3.2 pc for scr 0753 - 2524 , 13.1 @xmath20 2.6 pc for scr 0818 - 3110 and 40.0 @xmath20 8.0 pc for scr 1246 - 1236 . should these distance estimates hold true",
    ", three of the four objects lie within the 25 pc horizon , a volume in which there are only 109 white dwarfs currently having trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "trigonometric parallax observations via ctiopi are under way to determine accurate distances .      here",
    "we highlight systems included in this portion of the scr survey , most of which are multiple systems .",

    "one of the primary motivations for high proper motion surveys is , of course , the promise of detecting new nearby stars . the new nearby discoveries are typically red dwarfs , and occasionally , white dwarfs .",
    "the output lists of sources detected , once culled for false hits , also includes subdwarfs of very high intrinsic velocity that are generally not as near as their main sequence counterparts , but are nevertheless interesting in their own right as tracers of the galactic halo population .",

    "the two numbers given for each entry represent the number of scr systems reported in paper xii and this paper , respectively . in most cases the numbers are comparable , which reflects the fact that although much of the sky searched in this paper has already been searched by giclas and luyten , there is significantly more sky covered in this paper than in paper xii .    in total",
    ", we have found 43 new candidate systems within 25 pc of the sun .",
    "there remain several likely subdwarfs with overestimated distances that may fall in closer bins than indicated in table  [ diststats ] .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result of this survey is the discovery that the slowest proper motion ( 0@xmath26 yr@xmath3 @xmath9 @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath24 yr@xmath3 ) contains the largest number ( 26 ) of new candidates for systems within 25 pc .",

    "thus , searches for nearby stars buried in large samples with smaller proper motions are warranted , in particular given the availability of large photometric databases that allow the derivation of accurate distance estimates when optical and infrared data are combined , such as done here .",

    "seven additional proper motion companions to previously known hpm stars were also found .",
    "five of the nine white dwarf candidates are anticipated to be within 25 pc .",
    "worthy of note are the eight new scr stars brighter than @xmath8 @xmath5 12 , six of which have @xmath0 @xmath1 0@xmath25 yr@xmath3 , hinting at the possibility of relatively bright nearby stars that have not yet been identified .",
    "all three sets of stars  white dwarfs , red dwarfs , and subdwarfs  provide important contributions to these intrinsically faint , neglected samples . undoubtedly , objects fainter than our survey cutoff of @xmath8 @xmath5 16.5 remain to be found , as well as a small number of stars meeting our survey criteria that fell in crowded regions or were simply missed because of the stringent limits required for scr star veracity",
    ". finally , we are delighted to have discovered during the scr survey five new systems that are likely new members of the recons 10 pc sample , and are actively determining accurate parallaxes for them , as well as for many of the 38 other scr systems within 25 pc , via our parallax program in chile , ctiopi .",
