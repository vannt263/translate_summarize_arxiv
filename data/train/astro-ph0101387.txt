    "models assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the galactic gas layer are often used to describe the global state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( parker 1966 , badhwar & stephens 1977 , bloemen 1987 , boulares & cox 1990 , lockman & gehman 1991 , kalberla & kerp 1998 ) . despite matter outflows in the form of galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 , bregman 1980 , habe & ikeuchi 1980 ) and chimneys ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium appears to be viable when considering the average state of the ism over large scales or times .",

    "the galactic magnetic field has two distinct components , the regular field @xmath7 on length scales of the order 1kpc and the turbulent field @xmath8 with a typical scale of order 100pc .",

    "we discuss implications , for the strength and vertical distribution , of both regular and turbulent magnetic fields , resulting from hydrostatic equilibrium models .",
    "the validity of the model is assessed using independent information on the magnetic fields in the ism .",
    "descriptions of the state of the interstellar medium tend to concentrate on the situation in the solar vicinity .",
    "however , the gas disc is warped in the outer galaxy ( binney 1992 ) , and the warping implies that there is an additional force involved in the vertical equilibrium balance .",
    "in section  [ og ] we use simple arguments to illustrate some effects of the warp on the vertical gas distribution and to suggest that the vertical gas distribution can have a characteristic asymmetry in the warped disc .",
    "because of the warp , gas densities at @xmath9 above and below the displaced midplane can differ by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "an asymmetry of this kind has been observed in the outer galaxy ( diplas & savage 1991 ) , but went unnoticed .",

    "the assumption is probably weakest when considering the hot , ionized gas which presumably originates in the disc but fills the galactic halo , and so is involved in systematic vertical motions .",

    "a value of @xmath27 is in line with theoretical arguments showing that equipartition should exist between turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy densities ( zweibel & mckee 1995 , beck et al .",
    "if the turbulent magnetic field is concentrated into flux ropes and within these ropes energy equipartition also exists ( subramanian 1999 ) , then @xmath25 is the filling factor of the ropes .    by taking @xmath28 to be parallel to the galactic plane we neglect the contribution of magnetic tension due to the regular field to the support of the ism ( cf .",

    "the vertical regular magnetic field is definitely negligible near the midplane away from the disc centre ( ruzmaikin et al .",

    "the dominance of the horizontal magnetic field is more questionable in the galactic halo .",

    "different phases do not necessarily have a distinct physical nature and the distinction is often merely conventional ; for example , neutral and ionized halo components plausibly represent a single physical entity ; likewise , the separation of the warm and diffuse ionized phases may simply describe the increase of ionization degree with height .",

    "the model used by phillips et al .",
    "requires halo emissivity of about 10 percent of that in the disc , extending to about 10kpc beyond the midplane . roughly , emissivity is proportional to the total magnetic field squared or to a higher power if detailed equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays is maintained ( beck et al .",

    "we proceed with the assumption that the asymmetry is a real feature of the outer galaxy gas distribution .",
    "the results of diplas & savage ( 1991 ) , for three positions in the outer galaxy , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] .",
    "the maximum gas density is displaced to positive @xmath5 , reflecting the warp of the gas disc .",
    "it is also clear that the gas density is asymmetric with respect to the displaced midplane , with a density excess at positive @xmath5 .",
    "= 8.0 cm      to model gas equilibrium in a warped disc , we describe the warp locally as being produced by a @xmath5-independent acceleration @xmath169 , added across all @xmath5 as required to make @xmath170 the bottom of the potential well . since the stellar disc is not significantly warped , we scaled @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ gz ] ) to the outer galaxy ( ferrire 1998 ) ( neglecting edge effects and gravity from the gas since the region of interest is not far from the edge of the stellar disc ) and then added a constant acceleration @xmath171 at @xmath172 .",
    "the modulus of the resulting vertical acceleration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grav ] .",
    "acceleration of this magnitude displaces the gas density maximum to the observed height at this radius .",
    "thus , the vertical equilibrium equation ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) is replaced by @xmath173 with @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are defined after eq .",
    "( [ gz ] ) and @xmath177 .    if all of the pressure sources are symmetric with respect to the shifted midplane , the asymmetric force of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gog ] ) should give rise to a larger gas scale height above the shifted midplane at @xmath178 , similar to what is observed  see fits in fig .",

    "( [ outer_gravity ] ) and @xmath181 and @xmath182 represent the pressures due to magnetic fields and cosmic rays , respectively , as multiples of the gas pressure . a more detailed analysis as in section  [ he ]",
    "is hardly warranted here because of our limited knowledge of the gas parameters in the outer galaxy . assuming @xmath183 and using the asymmetric force of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gog ] ) , we fitted eq .",
    "( [ eq : parker ] ) to the observed density distribution using different values of the effective total gas velocity dispersion , @xmath184 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] , the density distributions are reproduced satisfactorily close to the shifted midplane with a single ( smaller ) velocity dispersion",
    ". however , there is additional asymmetry at larger heights which can be accounted for by larger values of @xmath184 at negative @xmath5 , at least at @xmath162 and @xmath185 .",
    "the same effect is found at other positions in the sector of the galactic disc that is positively warped ; at each position a further source of asymmetry is required as a higher order effect at large heights .    to quantify deviations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gog ] ) with a constant @xmath169 , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : grav2 ] the residual acceleration @xmath186 at @xmath172 both for a uniform velocity dispersion @xmath187 , a mean between the two approximations of fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] , and for @xmath188 ( shown dotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] ) above the shifted midplane and @xmath189 ( dashed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] ) below the midplane .",
    "the residual , asymmetric component of the acceleration is @xmath190 or less at @xmath191 from the midplane of the warped disc , so @xmath192 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the former option , illustrated in fig .  [ fig : grav2]a , attributes the whole residual asymmetry to a @xmath5-dependent component of the warping force , @xmath193 , which then must vary at a scale of order 1kpc , with @xmath193 possibly becoming",
    "comparable to @xmath169 at large heights .    in the latter case , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : grav2]b , one supposes that a part of the residual asymmetry is due to an asymmetric pressure in the ism .",
    "we have quantified the residual in terms of velocity dispersions .",
    "an obvious candidate for the residual asymmetry can be the regular magnetic field @xmath59 . we note that some galactic dynamo models are compatible with strongly asymmetric @xmath59 where @xmath59 vanishes in a layer at a height of about @xmath150 on one side of the disc .",
    "this could happen if regular magnetic fields in the disc and halo have different parities in @xmath5 ( sokoloff & shukurov 1990 , brandenburg et al .",
    "the range of @xmath193 in fig  [ fig : grav2]b , @xmath194 , would correspond to an asymmetric component of @xmath59 of order @xmath195 , where @xmath196 , gas density corresponds to @xmath197 , and @xmath7 has to be smaller above the midplane @xmath198 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ rmf ] , parameters of a multiphase ism in the solar vicinity are compatible with a model of hydrostatic equilibrium where approximate equipartition exists between the energy density of the turbulent magnetic field and the turbulent energy density of the gas in its diffuse phases .",
    "models of hydrostatic equilibrium are sensitive to the midplane strength of the regular magnetic field , @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath199 , the ism may be overpressured at @xmath200 ( so hydrostatic equilibrium is a poor approximation there ) , and this can contribute to driving the galactic fountain .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field should be coupled more weakly to the molecular clouds than with the other , diffuse gas phases ; otherwise , the regular magnetic field strength has a deep , narrow minimum at @xmath39 .    if @xmath201 then our model gives two - component vertical profiles of both regular , @xmath7 , and turbulent , @xmath8 , magnetic fields .",
    "the narrower components have scale heights of @xmath202 for the regular magnetic field , @xmath203 for the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the more extended components have an approximately constant regular magnetic field strength of @xmath121 for @xmath204 and @xmath205 at @xmath39 .",
    "the vertical dependence of the degree of linear polarization of synchrotron emission expected from the derived @xmath59 and @xmath206 , shows a steady increase above @xmath207 similar to that observed for external edge - on galaxies .",
    "models with @xmath42 seem to be simpler and more attractive than those with @xmath44 .",
    "the former are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium maintained at all heights , whereas the overpressure at @xmath208 in the latter models drives systematic vertical gas flow to the halo at a speed of about @xmath3 .",
    "this counterintuitive conclusion results from a larger contribution of turbulent magnetic fields and cosmic rays to the total pressure required in the latter models for hydrostatic equilibrium at @xmath209 . we should emphasize that our results with @xmath44 are only tentative at @xmath210 where our basic assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium does not apply with this value of @xmath43 .",
    "we have demonstrated in section  [ og ] that the vertical force acting on the gas in a warped disc should become asymmetric in @xmath5 , resulting in asymmetry in the gas distribution . by taking the simplest form for the vertical structure of the warping force as a first approximation and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium can be reached",
    ", we calculated the expected vertical gas density distribution .",
    "the observed warping is produced by an acceleration of @xmath211 at @xmath172 .",
    "the vertical profiles of neutral hydrogen density in the outer galaxy ( diplas & savage 1991 ) show an asymmetry of the expected form , with the density @xmath212 above the shifted midplane a factor of @xmath10 higher than the density @xmath212 below .",
