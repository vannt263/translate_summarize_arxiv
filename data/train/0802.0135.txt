    "double - mode radial pulsators play a very significant role in the study of pulsating stars .",
    "this is because we can determine all fundamental stellar parameters just by using a few observed parameters and relying on the rather solid theory of linear radial pulsation ( assuming of course , that the mode identification is correct  a question often raised for typically low - amplitude pulsators whereas rarely bothered with in the case of high / moderate - amplitude ones ) . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we investigated the consistency of the method by using the observed colours and assumed cluster metallicities in deriving distances for globular clusters and for the magellanic clouds .",
    "these distances have been confirmed by independent studies , for example by direct hst parallax measurements of @xcite and @xcite , by _",
    "hipparcos_-based @xmath7  scuti pl - relation of @xcite , by mixtures of parallax and interferometric methods of @xcite and by baade - wesselink analyses @xcite . in",
    "yet another application , @xcite put limits on the metallicities of magellanic cloud beat cepheids through stellar evolution constraints .    double - mode radial pulsators are also viable for nonlinear hydrodynamical modelling .",
    "although early attempts have already shown that sustained double - mode pulsation is possible with purely radiative hydrodynamical codes ( at least for rr  lyrae stars , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the modelling was put on a better sounding physical ground only after time - dependent convection was more carefully included ( for cepheids by @xcite , for rr  lyrae stars by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although these models are capable of producing stable double - mode pulsation in the appropriate neighbourhood of the physical parameter space and the model light curves are in reasonable agreement with the observed ones , star - by - star modelling and application of more stringent observational constraints are still lacking .",
    "large - scale surveys aimed at microlensing and variability studies have already yielded a considerable increase in the number of known double - mode variables .",
    "in particular , before 2000 , only four double - mode rr  lyrae ( rrd ) stars were identified in the milky way ( see @xcite and @xcite for additional statistics ) . at the moment of this writing we have 26 rrd stars known in the galactic field according to the literature , mostly due to the nsvs and asas full - sky variability surveys , and many more in the galactic bulge , due to the ogle survey ( @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the field rr lyrae star bscom ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) was originally put on the observing list of the 60 cm automated telescope of the konkoly observatory ( see @xcite for details on the ongoing photometric survey ) , due to the suspected blazhko behaviour of this star reported by @xcite . while gathering data , the star was analysed by @xcite , using the nsvs database .",
    "he found that bscom was an rrd star  yr alias of the fundamental period . ] .",
    "this paper describes the results of the frequency analysis of our data and the pulsational / evolutionary analysis .",
    "the result of this latter , purely theoretical study will be confronted with additional constraints posed by the effective temperature and metallicity obtained from our multi - colour data . we show that the purely theoretical approach yields stellar parameters in agreement with the colour data and can be used for very accurate parameter estimation once we are able to pose an age limit for the object .",
    "we obtained @xmath10 photometric observations of bscom with the 60  cm automated telescope of the konkoly observatory , budapest .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a wright @xmath11 ccd providing a @xmath12 field of view ( detailed parameters are given by @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were carried out between 2005 march 1 and 2006 april 17 in 3 seasons , on a total number of 35 nights .",
    "observational statistics are shown in table  [ tab : obstat ] .",
    "bscom magnitudes were measured relative to bd+24  2598 by aperture photometry .",
    "gsc00454 - 00454 and usno - b11143 - 0206728 served as check stars .",
    "we used standard iraf packages for data reduction procedures .",
    "coefficients for linear transformation of the instrumental data into standard magnitudes were derived each year .",
    "bscom was tied to the standard photometric system in @xmath13 and @xmath14 colours through the comparison star bd+24  2598 .",
    "the magnitudes of bd+24  2598 were measured relative to hd117876 ( @xmath15@xmath16 , @xmath17@xmath18 , @xmath19@xmath20 , @xmath21@xmath22 , see @xcite ) , the closest standard star to bscom .",
    "the observations were carried out near two subsequent culminations , under very good weather conditions . because of the brightness of hd117876 , a large fraction of the incoming light had to be blocked in order to avoid saturation .",
    "we reduced the effective aperture of the telescope to the @xmath23 of its original size by placing a circular diaphragm at the front end of the telescope tube . because of the @xmath24 angular distance between hd117876 and bd+242598 , it was not possible to observe the stars in a common field of view . in order to keep our photometric precision ,",
    "the two distinct fields were observed repeatedly .",
    "we obtained 5 , 10 , and 9 frames in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively , for each of the two stars .",
    "data were corrected for atmospheric extinction .",
    "the standard magnitudes and their formal statistical errors are shown in table  [ tab : mags ] .",
    "for bscom , magnitude averages are shown , calculated over the complete light curve solution given in sect .",

    "@xmath28 is given in [ k ] , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are measured in solar units , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are in [ cgs ] .",
    "observed periods match within @xmath34  d. the modified periods are @xmath35 and @xmath36  days .    in szab",
    "( in preparation ) we examine the period shifts between the asymptotic nonlinear period of the convective models and those of the purely radiative linear non - adiabatic models ( i.e. the ones we use in this paper ) .",
    "the results are based on many different models , including various combinations of physical and model construction parameters ( notably depth of the inner boundary and number of mass shells constituting the stellar model ) .",
    "all models show that both modes have longer periods in the asymptotic double - mode regime than those in the lna approximation .",
    "the amount of period increase is smaller than @xmath37  days .",
    "the shifts lead to period ratio values that are lower by up to @xmath38 than the lna ones . for the overall relative period shifts we get : @xmath39 assuming that the observed periods of bscom correspond to the nonlinear asymptotic values , the predicted _ modified _ lna values are as follows : @xmath40 with these periods we performed the same type of lna survey as described in sect .  5 for the observed periods .",
    "the result is shown in table  c1 . by comparing the items at the same chemical composition and temperature with those matching the observed periods",
    ", we see that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are shifted to larger values by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively",
    ". however , in the final solution the difference between the parameters obtained by the predicted and directly computed lna periods will be considerably smaller , due to the compensating effect of changes in @xmath28 and [ fe / h ] ( see sect .  5 for additional details ) ."
