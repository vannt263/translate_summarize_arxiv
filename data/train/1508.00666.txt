    "[ sec : intro ] boundary conditions are paramount in many areas of computer modeling in science . at the atomic level ,",
    "finite samples require appropriate boundary conditions in order that atoms in the interior behave as if they were part of a larger or infinite sample , or as closely to this as is possible .",
    "one example of this is the calculation of the electronic properties of covalent materials where the surface is terminated with h atoms so that all the chemical valency is satisfied . in this way the homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) and the lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) states inside the sample can be obtained that are not very different from those expected in the bulk sample . in",
    "materials science the electronic band structure of a sample of crystalline si could be obtained by determining the electronic properties of a finite cluster terminated with h bonds at the surface . in practice",
    "this is rarely done , as it is more convenient to use periodic boundary conditions and hence use bloch s theorem , but this technique has been used recently in graphene nanoribbons @xcite .    for most samples ,",
    "the nature of the boundary , fixed , free or periodic only alters the properties of the sample by the ratio of the number of atoms on the surface to those in the bulk .",
    "this ratio is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of atoms ( _ later referred to as vertices _ ) and @xmath2 is the dimension .",
    "of course this ratio goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit as the size of the system @xmath3 and leads to the important result that properties become independent of boundary conditions for large enough systems .",
    "similar statements can be made about the mechanical and vibrational properties of systems _ except _ for isostatic networks that lie on the border of mechanical instability . in this case",
    "the boundary conditions are important no matter how large @xmath1 , and special care must be taken with devising boundary conditions so that the interior atoms behave as if they were part of an infinite sample , in as much as this is possible @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , we show a part of a scanning probe microscope ( spm ) image @xcite of a bilayer of vitreous silica which has the chemical formula sio@xmath4 .",
    "the sample consists of an upper layer of tetrahedra with all the apexes pointing downwards where they join a mirror image in the lower layer . in the figure",
    "we show the triangular faces of the upper tetrahedra , which form rigid triangles with a ( red ) si atom at the center and the ( black ) o atoms at the vertices of the triangles which are freely jointed to a good approximation .",
    "we refer to these networks as _ locally isostatic _ as the number of degrees of freedom of the equilateral triangle in two dimensions is exactly balanced by the shared pinning constraints ( 2 at each of the 3 vertices , so that @xmath5 ) .",
    "while the @xmath6d bilayers are locally isostatic , so too are the @xmath7d projections of corner - sharing triangles which are the focus of this paper .",
    "we will use the _ berlin a _ sample as the example throughout @xcite so that we can focus on this single geometry for pedagogical purposes .    because experimental samples are always finite in extent and usually have irregular boundaries , including internal regions that are either absent , or not imaged it is necessary to develop appropriate boundary conditions . note that the option of cutting a rectangular piece out of the experimental image is not available because of the amorphous nature of the network , which means that it is not possible for the left side to connect to the right side as with a regular crystalline network .",
    "even if this were possible , it would be unwise to discard experimental data and hence loose information . in this paper",
    "we show how boundary conditions can be applied to locally isostatic systems which are not periodic .        in this paper",
    ", we show rigorously that there are various ways to add back the exact number of missing constraints at the surface , in a way that they are sufficiently uniformly distributed around the boundary that the network is guaranteed to be isostatic everywhere .",
    "there is some limited freedom in the precise way these boundary conditions are implemented , and the boundary can be general enough to include internal holes . the proof techniques used here involves showing that _ all _ subgraphs have insufficient edge density for redundancy to occur @xcite . in the appendix , we give an algorithmic desctiption of our boundary conditions and discuss in detail how to ensure the resulting boundary is sufficiently generic .    using the pebble game @xcite",
    ", we verified on a number of samples that anchored boundary conditions in which alternating free vertices are pinned results in a global isostatic state .",
    "the pebble game is an integer algorithm , based on laman s theorem @xcite , which for a particular network performs a rigid region decomposition , which involves finding the rigid regions , the hinges between them , and the number of floppy ( zero - frequency ) modes .",
    "we have used it to confirm that the locally isostatic samples such as that in this paper are isostatic overall with anchored boundary conditions .",
    "the results of this paper imply that , under a relatively mild connectivity hypothesis , this procedure is provably correct , and thus , relatively robust .",
    "additionally , the necessity of running the pebble game for each individual case is avoided .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows _ sliding _ boundary condition @xcite .",
    "these make use of a different , simpler kind of geometric constraint at each unpinned surface site .",
    "the global effect on the network s degrees of freedom is like that of the anchored boundary conditions , and this setup is computationally reasonable . at the same time , the proofs for this case are simpler , and generalize more easily to handle situations such as holes in the sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , we show the anchored boundary conditions . we have trimmed off the surface triangles in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] that are only pinned at one vertex .",
    "this makes for a a more compact structure whose properties are more likely to mimic those of a larger sample , and makes our mathematical statements easier to formulate .",
    "in addition we have had to remove the 3 purple triangles at the lower right hand side in order to get an even number of unpinned surface sites .",
    "when the network is embedded in the plane , this is possible , except for very degenerate samples ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) .    .",

    "the red si atoms at the centers of the triangles in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] have also been removed for clarity .",
    "the boundary is formed as a smooth analytic curve by using a fourier series with 16 sine and 16 cosines terms to match the number of surface vertices , where the center for the radius @xmath8 is placed at the centroid of the 32 boundary vertices @xcite .",

    "proving lemma [ lemma : indep ] requires ruling out the appearance of _ additional _ degrees of freedom that could arise from _ sub - structures _ that contain more constraints than degrees of freedom .",
    "the essential idea behind combinatorial rigidity is that _ generically _ all geometric constraints are visible from the topology of the structure , as typified by laman s @xcite striking result showing the sufficiency of maxwell counting @xcite in dimension @xmath7 .",
    "genericity means , roughly , that there is no special geometry present ; in particular , generic instances of any topology are dense in the set of all instances .    in what follows , _",
    "we will be assuming genericity _ , and then use results similar to laman s , in that they are based on an appropriate variation of maxwell counting .",
    "our proofs have a graph - theoretic flavor , which relate certain hypotheses about connectivity to hereditary maxwell - type counts .",
    "we will model the flexibility in the upper layer of vitrious silica bilayers as systems of @xmath7d triangles , pinned togehter at the corners .",
    "the joints at the corners are allowed to rotate freely .",
    "a triangle ring network is _ rigid _ if the only available motions preserving triangle shapes and the network s connectivity are rigid body motions ; it is _ isostatic _ if it is rigid , but ceases to be so once any joint is removed .",

    "see jackson and jordn @xcite and the references therein for an overview of the area . ] from rigidity theory .",
    "the combinatorial model is a graph @xmath9 that has one vertex for each triangle and an edge between two triangles if they share a corner ( figure [ fig : figure6 ] ) .",
    "since we are assuming genericity , we will identify a geometric realization with the graph @xmath9 from now on . in",
    "what follows , we are interested in a particular class of graphs @xmath9 , which we call _ triangle ring networks_. the definition of a triangle ring is as follows : ( a ) @xmath9 has only vertices of degree @xmath7 and @xmath6 ; @xmath9 is @xmath7-connected , we need to remove at least @xmath7 vertices . ] ; ( b ) there is a simple cycle @xmath10 in @xmath9 that contains all the degree @xmath7 vertices , and there are at least @xmath6 degree @xmath7 vertices ; ( c ) any edge cut set , results in a graph @xmath7 connected components . ] in @xmath9 that disconnects a subgraph containing only degree @xmath6 vertices has size at least @xmath6 .",

    "the first statement is straightforward .",
    "the second follows from observing that if a rigid subgraph @xmath16 has two vertices on the boundary of @xmath9 , then @xmath9 can not be @xmath7-connected , since all the edges detaching @xmath16 from @xmath9 are incident on a single vertex .",

    "what is perhaps more striking is that theorem [ theo : slider - pinning ] still applies whether or not such a @xmath10 exists , provided faces in @xmath9 defining the holes in the sample are disjoint from the boundary and each other .    in applying anchored boundary conditions",
    ", it is important that the complete boundary has an even number of unpinned sites , which can include internal holes , which must then be connected using the green lines shown in the various figures .",
    "this gives a practical way of setting up calculations with anchored boundary conditions in samples with complex geometries and missing areas .",

    "algorithms [ alg : slider - pinning][alg : bars-2 ] in this appendix give a procedural description of the four boundary conditions discussed in this paper , and make clear the subtle differences between them .",
    "all of the algorithms in this appendix take as input a finite part of a locally isostatic network and output a globally isostatic one that is appropriate for further study . which of the boundary conditions is most appropriate",
    "will depend on the intended application .",
    "computationally , it is convenient to work not only with the body graph @xmath9 , as in the main body of the paper , but also with its _ line graph _ @xmath42 that has as its vertices the triangle corners and edges the triangle sides .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the number of vertices and edges in @xmath9 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 the same quantities for @xmath42 .",
    "vertices in @xmath9 are denoted by @xmath47 and vertices in @xmath42 by @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that there is a constant - time mapping @xmath49 that maps each vertex @xmath11 of @xmath9 to the associated triangle @xmath50 in @xmath42 .",
    "for each boundary vertex @xmath11 of @xmath9 , @xmath51 will have a unique degree @xmath7 vertex , which we denote by @xmath52 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath42 will always be immediately visible .",
    "it is also computable in time @xmath53 from @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is planar with given facial structure , then @xmath42 also has an natural planar embedding , and vice - versa .",
    "further , if @xmath42 contains no pair of facial triangles with a common edge , then @xmath9 is determined by @xmath42 .",
    "this is the case in all of our examples .        the allowed first - order motions @xmath57 of a triangle ring network @xmath9 satisfy the system @xmath58 we assume that @xmath56 maximizes the rank of ( [ eq : inf - bars ] ) , which happens for almost all choices of @xmath56 . by the theorems in this paper ,",
    "this rank is equal to @xmath46 when @xmath9 is a triangle ring network .",
    "now identify a set @xmath59 of vertices to which we will add one slider constraint . assign a vector @xmath60 to each @xmath61 .",
    "the slider constraints on the first - order motions are : @xmath62 to guarantee that the combined system ( [ eq : inf - bars])([eq : inf - sliders ] ) achieves its maximum rank ( @xmath63 for our sliding boundary condition ) , it is sufficient to pick each @xmath64 uniformly at random from the unit circle .                to implement theorem [ theo : thumbtack - pinning ] , we could put two independent sliders at vertices of @xmath42 . however , it is simpler to regard ( [ eq : inf - bars ] ) as a matrix and then discard the columns corresponding to immobilized vertices .                anchoring with additional bars amounts to adding edges to @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we describe them graph theoretically only .",
    "if the geometric constraints are desired , simply use the new graph to write down ( [ eq : inf - bars ] ) .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : figure8ab ] takes the graph @xmath33 from theorem [ theo : bars-2 ] to be a `` zig - zag triangulation '' of a polygon , which is easily seen to be isostatic .",
    "this next algorithm gives the implementation of theorem [ theo : bars-2 ] using this choice ."
