    "the set of positive maps acting on a finite dimensional hilbert space is a long - standing subject of mathematical interest . in spite of many efforts ( see @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "the structure of this set in spaces of arbitrary dimension is still not well understood .",
    "of particular interest are positive maps , which are not completely positive @xcite .",
    "the theorem of jamiokowski implies @xcite that any such map can be represented by an operator , acting on a bi - partite hilbert space , which is not positive , but is block - positive .",
    "non completely positive maps recently attracted a considerable attention of the physics community @xcite .",
    "positive maps have mainly been studied in view of their possible application to characterize quantum entanglement @xcite and in connection to entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "an entanglement witness is a hermitian operator @xmath0 such that @xmath1 for any separable state @xmath2 , while negativity of @xmath3 implies that the state @xmath4 is entangled .",
    "note that a hermitian operator @xmath0 may be considered as an observable , so the expectation value @xmath3 can be measured in an experiment @xcite . from a mathematical perspective any entanglement witness is a block positive operator which is not positive .    in the present paper we aim to clarify the relation between positive maps and positive polynomials .",
    "definitions and basic information can be found in section [ sec.defs.blockpos ] . in section [ sectestingbp ]",
    ", we explore the link between positive maps and positive polynomials and we address problems related to early contributions on the subject . in particular , we analyze implications of the work of jamiokowski @xcite and show why the results of these papers do not allow one to formulate a conclusive test for positivity of a given map .    on the other hand , in some particular cases such results can be obtained . in sections",
    "[ secabc ] and [ sec4x4test ] , we investigate two families of maps and working with the corresponding polynomials we find explicit conditions for positivity .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate how positive maps relate to the existence of positive polynomials which are not sums of squares and we formulate an open problem concerning entanglement witnesses in @xmath5 dimensional spaces .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 be finite dimensional spaces over @xmath8 , both equipped with hermitian inner products ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the algebra of linear operators on @xmath6 .",
    "we denote with @xmath12 the set of positive elements of @xmath11 .",
    "a linear map @xmath13 is called _ positive _ if and only if it maps elements of @xmath12 to elements of @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the set of positive maps is isomorphic to the set of _ block positive operators _ ( block positive over @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , instead of asking whether a given map is positive , in this work we will be concerned with the equivalent question whether the corresponding operator is block positive , so it can serve as an entanglement witness .    a hermitian operator @xmath15 on @xmath16 is called _ block positive over @xmath8 _ if it satisfies the following condition , @xmath17 note that condition is not invariant with respect to global unitary transformations on @xmath18 , so this definition depends on the particular form of the decomposition of @xmath18 .",
    "it will also be useful to introduce the concept of block positivity for real linear spaces .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be finite dimensional vector spaces over @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "let @xmath15 be a linear operator on @xmath24 . in analogy to",
    ", we say that @xmath15 is _ block positive over @xmath21 _ if it satisfies @xmath25 condition does not imply symmetry of @xmath15 , but we may always assume that @xmath15 is symmetric because the antisymmetric part of @xmath15 in vanishes .",
    "thence @xmath26 is a symmetric bilinear form on @xmath24 .    in index notation",
    ", condition reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coordinates of @xmath30 and @xmath31 with respect to the orthonormal bases @xmath32 , @xmath33 of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( resp . ) which we are using .",
    "obviously , is a positivity condition for a real multivariate polynomial of degree @xmath34 . if the polynomial @xmath35 is a _ sum of squares _",
    "( sos ) of some other polynomials @xmath36 , then we must have @xmath37 where the real coefficients @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are arbitrary and the range of the index @xmath41 is finite .",
    "indeed , the polynomials @xmath36 must be homogeneous and of degree @xmath42 .",
    "they can not have terms of the form @xmath43 , neither of the form @xmath44 , since there are no terms @xmath45 nor @xmath46 in the sum @xmath35 .",
    "thus we conclude that if @xmath47 for some polynomials @xmath36 , then @xmath48 .",
    "but looks just like a quadratic form on @xmath24 , written in the product basis @xmath49 . it is tempting to say that implies positive semidefinitness of @xmath15 , but _ this is not true_. nevertheless , a similar result can be proved if we assume that @xmath15 is _ symmetric with respect to partial transpose _ , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the transposition .",
    "putting this in a different way , @xmath15 should satisfy @xmath52    for any operator @xmath15 being a sos and expressed by eq .",
    ", we may define the following operator @xmath53 , @xmath54 it is easy to see that @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , @xmath57 . in appendix [ apphia ]",
    "we show that this property together with and imply @xmath58 . but",
    "@xmath53 is of the special form , which we did not assume about @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath53 is proportional to a sum of a semipositive definite operator @xmath59 with matrix elements @xmath60 and its partial transposition @xmath61 with matrix elements @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath47 implies @xmath63 for the operators @xmath15 with the property . a hermitian operator @xmath15 is called _ decomposable _ @xcite iff @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "when holds , one can easily prove that is equivalent to decomposability of @xmath15 .",
    "thus we arrive at the following conclusion ,    [ indecompprop ] let @xmath66 be finite dimensional linear spaces over @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the set of * block positive , indecomposable * operators on @xmath24 which are symmetric with respect to transposition and * partial transposition*. denote with @xmath68 the set of * positive real polynomials * of the form @xmath69 which are * not sos*. there is a linear isomorphism between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the isomorphism in question is @xmath70 .",
    "we still need to show that @xmath71 is one - to - one . to this end",
    ", we assume the equality @xmath72 for some operators @xmath73 .",
    "choose some @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "considering the coefficients at @xmath76 in the two polynomials , we get @xmath77 .",
    "thanks to the partial transpose symmetry of @xmath15 and @xmath59 , we get @xmath78 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath71 is injective . on the other hand , every polynomial of the form @xmath79 is an image by @xmath71 of the partial transpose symmetric operator @xmath80 .",
    "the operator @xmath80 must be an element of @xmath67 for @xmath79 to be an element of @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "the discussion above ) .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath71 is surjective .",
    "it was demonstrated by choi @xcite and strmer @xcite that there exist positive maps which are not decomposable .",
    "the example by choi can be easily used to show that there exist , by proposition [ indecompprop ] , positive polynomials of the form @xmath69 which are not sos @xcite .",
    "proposition [ indecompprop ] gives a general motivation to investigate block positive operators over @xmath21 on account of their connection to sums of squares .",
    "it may also be expedient to study the real case in order to develop intuitions about block positivity over @xmath8 .",
    "it should , however , be kept in mind that and _ are not the same_. despite an apparent similarity , the block positivity over @xmath81 should not be perceived as a simple generalization of the block positivity over @xmath21 . in general both definitions of block positivity",
    "do not coincide , what can be demonstrated by the following example of a real symmetric matrix ,    @xmath82.\\ ] ]    this matrix represents an operator on @xmath83 written in the standard product basis , @xmath84 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath15 satisfies inequality , but it does not satisfy condition .",
    "hence the matrix @xmath15 in is block positive over @xmath21 , but is not block positive over @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , when considering operators with unit trace , one can easily show that the set of such block positive operators over @xmath8 is compact whereas block positivity over @xmath21 does not imply compactness . in spite of this basic difference between the two notions of block positivity",
    ", there exist families of matrices for which conditions and turn out to be equivalent  see section [ secabc ] .",
    "although the block positivity condition is simple to understand , it does not seem easy to check .",
    "the early papers by jamiokowski @xcite suggest that the problem can be solved effectively . even though this conclusion is in some sense true",
    ", we show a weak point of the argument presented in these papers .    for convenience of the reader ,",
    "let us recall the details of the reasoning presented in @xcite .",
    "first , we write condition in index notation , @xmath85 next , we introduce _ blocks _ , @xmath86 we can interpret them simply as matrices or as operators on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "block positivity condition can be rewritten as @xmath87 where `` @xmath88 '' refers to semipositive definiteness .",
    "we shall concentrate on the right hand side of .",
    "semipositivity of @xmath89 is equivalent to the following set of inequalities , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the minor of @xmath89 involving the columns and the rows with the numbers @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from the discussion in @xcite that the functions @xmath93 are homogeneous real polynomials of an even degree in the variables @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "thus is a set of positivity conditions for real homogeneous polynomials of an even degree .",
    "if we could solve these conditions explicitly , we would answer the question whether a given matrix is block positive .",
    "that was the idea presented in @xcite by jamiokowski , who suggested considering @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) as a polynomial in the variable @xmath98 with coefficients in @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "he obtained positivity conditions for such a polynomial in a disjunctive normal form , @xmath100 where @xmath101\\forall_{i , j}$ ] .",
    "because the same procedure could be applied to any of the @xmath102 s ( considered as elements of @xmath103\\left[x_{n-1}\\right]$ ] ) , it was claimed that the number of variables in can be iteratively reduced so as to yield quantifier free formulas .",
    "the problem with this argument is that eq . does not turn out to be equivalent to @xmath104 so one can not use the procedure iteratively .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no simple method is known to check positivity of a general multivariate polynomial .",
    "it is in principle possible to eliminate quantifiers @xcite from formulas like @xmath105 , but the outcome involves _ zeros of univariate polynomials of an arbitrary high degree _ , which can not in general be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the polynomials .",
    "the known quantifier elimination procedures are laborious and should not be expected to provide a constructive solution to the problem .",
    "thus we have to conclude this section by repeating the accepted statement that the question of explicit conditions for block positivity remains open .",
    "fortunately , there exist some particular cases for which positivity conditions turn out to be useful in checking block positivity .",
    "let @xmath106 . consider the following family of matrices , @xmath107}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc }                  \\frac{1}{2}&a&0&0\\\\          \\bar a&\\frac{1}{2}&b&0\\\\",
    "0&\\bar b&\\frac{1}{2}&c\\\\          0&0&\\bar c&\\frac{1}{2}\\\\                \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] which represent operators on @xmath108 .",
    "we are going to test condition using the method suggested in the previous section .",
    "the blocks ( [ blocks ] ) with respect to the subsystem described by @xmath109 are @xmath110.\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath111 is semipositive definite for all @xmath112 if and only if @xmath113 .",
    "that is , @xmath114 keeping @xmath115 and @xmath116 constant , we can maximize the absolute value of the term @xmath117 by choosing the phases of @xmath118 and @xmath119 such that the phase of @xmath120 is the same as the phase of @xmath121 .",
    "so done , we see that condition is equivalent to @xmath122 in inequality , we substituted @xmath30 for @xmath115 and @xmath31 for @xmath116 .",
    "it is now easy to see that is the same as @xmath123 we extended the domain of @xmath124 in to @xmath21 , which is permissible because @xmath125 does not increase if we change the sign of @xmath30 or @xmath31 from plus to minus . substituting @xmath126 , @xmath127 in we obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",

    "together with the condition on @xmath137 , we obtain @xmath138 which is an equivalent form of . in the case",
    "b ) , it is even simpler to get the conditions on @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 equivalent to .",

    "we get @xmath149 in the case of general @xmath150 , @xmath141 and @xmath151 , condition is equivalent to the following system of four inequalities , @xmath152 which have to be satisfied for all real @xmath153 .",
    "the expression on the left hand side of condition iv ) is a polynomial @xmath154 of degree four in the variable @xmath155 .",
    "this condition means that @xmath156 is nonnegative in the interval @xmath157 $ ] .",
    "given particular values of @xmath150 , @xmath141 and @xmath151 , nonnegativity of @xmath156 in @xmath157 $ ] can be easily checked using the sturm sequences @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to produce general conditions on @xmath150 , @xmath141 , @xmath151 in this way , but the resulting formulas would be too complicated to reproduce them here and not suitable for further analysis .",
    "an analogous problem of block positivity over @xmath21 can also be solved for the family of matrices .",
    "most of the work has already been done above .",
    "we only need to observe that the passage from to is possible also when @xmath150 , @xmath141 , @xmath151 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 are real numbers .",
    "this is true because the maximal value of @xmath158 for fixed @xmath159 , @xmath160 is @xmath161 .",
    "thus the condition turns out to be equivalent to block positivity over @xmath21 of the matrices of the form with @xmath162 .",
    "later analysis follows as in the case b ) discussed above . in this way we arrive at two important conclusions .",
    "firstly , symmetric matrices of the form are block positive over @xmath21 if and only if they are block positive over @xmath8 .",
    "secondly , the block positivity condition takes the form with @xmath163 , @xmath164 . on the other hand , positivity conditions for the family of matrices",
    "are easily obtained , @xmath165 we can compare them with the block positivity condition in a picture .",
    "is equivalent to the block positivity over @xmath21 .",

    "it is clear from figure [ fig : author ] that the conditions and are not equivalent , and the set of positive matrices of the family forms a proper subset of the set of block positive matrices .",
    "a similar investigation can be performed for a related family of matrices , @xmath169\\ ] ] with real parameters @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the block positivity conditions for @xmath172 can be obtained using the methods presented in this section .",

    "as can be checked by direct computation , the characteristic polynomials of @xmath172 and @xmath187 are the same .",
    "it follows that @xmath188 , which in turn leads us to the conclusion that the matrix @xmath189 is block positive if and only if it is positive .    to explain our observation about @xmath190",
    ", we could also have used the strmer - woronowicz theorem @xcite , which implies that _ an operator @xmath15 on @xmath191 ( or on @xmath192 ) is block positive if and only if it is decomposable_. this suggests a possible connection between the caldern s and the strmer - woronowicz theorems .",
    "on the other hand , the first theorem holds for all @xmath193 ( @xmath176 ) whereas the latter works for @xmath194 only .",

    "and we know that @xmath284 , @xmath285 are symmetric bilinear forms on @xmath20 . as a consequence of @xmath278 , @xmath286 for arbitrary @xmath57 . hence the quadratic forms corresponding to @xmath279 and @xmath280 are equal .",
    "this implies @xmath287 , so we get @xmath288 now we consider the maps @xmath289 , @xmath290 . from the symmetry of @xmath279 , @xmath280 and the properties ,",
    ", we see that @xmath291 , @xmath292 are symmetric bilinear forms on @xmath19 . as a consequence of , @xmath293 for all @xmath56 .",
    "this implies @xmath294 for arbitrary @xmath295 . in this way we get @xmath296 , which is the same as @xmath297 of course ,",
    "implies @xmath298 .",
    "our aim is to figure out all the sign configurations of @xmath265 such that they meet the constraints @xmath299 and they correspond to nonnegative polynomials @xmath300 .",
    "we also have to check that the remaining sign configurations can never give a nonnegative @xmath220 .",
    "of course , @xmath301 implies that @xmath302 be negative for some @xmath30 , so we only need to consider @xmath303 positive .",
    "first we show that @xmath304 can not happen for a nonnegative @xmath220 .",
    "suppose @xmath304 .",
    "we know that @xmath305 or @xmath306 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath305 . because @xmath307 and @xmath308 , we can increase @xmath309 by @xmath310 and get @xmath311 for sure .",
    "if @xmath312 turns out to be zero after this operation , we additionally increase @xmath313 by @xmath314 , which must give us @xmath315 because @xmath316 where @xmath317 does not depend on @xmath313 .",
    "the numbers @xmath318 , @xmath319 can be made arbitrarily small , so as not to influence the sign of @xmath320 .",
    "hence we see that @xmath321 has a normal sturm sequence and it does not satisfy because the @xmath320 corresponding to @xmath321 is positive . but @xmath322 implies @xmath323 , so @xmath220 can not be nonnegative .",
    "we conclude that @xmath324 is impossible for @xmath308 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 . for @xmath308 , @xmath304 and @xmath306",
    ", we only need to increase @xmath220 by a sufficiently small @xmath319 to get to the conclusion @xmath323 .",
    "our observations mean that @xmath304 always implies @xmath323 .",
    "let us now consider the polynomials @xmath220 for which conditions @xmath325 are satisfied .",
    "if @xmath326 vanishes , we can get @xmath311 by increasing @xmath309 ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "if @xmath312 turns out to be @xmath328 afterwards , any change of @xmath313 ( @xmath329 ) will give us @xmath330 ( cf .",
    "the discussion above ) .",
    "we can take @xmath318 and @xmath319 arbitrarily small , which allows us to avoid changing the sign of @xmath320 .",
    "after all , we get a polynomial @xmath321 which has a normal sturm sequence and it is positive since @xmath331 for the corresponding @xmath303 , @xmath326 and @xmath320 . because @xmath318 and @xmath319 can be arbitrarily small , we see that @xmath220 is a pointwise limit of a sequence of positive polynomials .",
    "hence @xmath220 is nonnegative .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for @xmath308 , @xmath332 , @xmath306 and @xmath333 , so we should add to our set of non - negativity conditions .",
    "we can write and as a single condition , @xmath334 the only situation which is left to analyze is that of @xmath335 . to that end , let us write @xmath320 as a polynomial in @xmath313 , @xmath336 where @xmath337 because of the assumption @xmath308 , we know that @xmath320 is not constant with respect to @xmath313 .",
    "the idea now is to infinitesimally increase @xmath313 and see what the outcome is .",
    "if @xmath320 becomes positive , we conclude that @xmath323 .",
    "if it turns out to be negative ( we denote this with @xmath338 ) , we go back to the initial values of @xmath214 and ask about the signs of @xmath326 , @xmath312 . if @xmath311 , we choose @xmath314 so small that @xmath311 holds when we increase @xmath313 by @xmath319 . then is true for @xmath339 , so @xmath339 is nonnegative . since the @xmath319 in @xmath339",
    "can be made arbitrarily small , we get @xmath324 . if @xmath305 , we increase @xmath313 by @xmath319 to get @xmath333 and then we increase @xmath309 by @xmath318 so as to get @xmath311 and not to violate @xmath304 .",
    "after that holds for @xmath321 and again we get to the conclusion that @xmath324",
    ". therefore we can add @xmath340 to our list of non - negativity conditions for @xmath220 .",
    "now we only need to analyze the case @xmath341 to finish our work .",
    "if @xmath342 , we choose @xmath314 so small that the @xmath312 corresponding to @xmath339 is also positive .",
    "then @xmath343 and we get @xmath324 . the case @xmath306 is also simple to analyze . because @xmath344 , increasing @xmath313 causes @xmath345 to become positive , so we get @xmath346 for @xmath339 and again this leads us to @xmath324 .",
    "thus we can add @xmath347 to our nonnegativity conditions for @xmath220 .",
    "it is convenient to write and in a single formula , @xmath348 because of the particular form of @xmath320 , we explicitly write the condition @xmath349 as @xmath350 since condition @xmath308 implies that @xmath351 .                                              c. michaux , a. ozturk , _ quantifier elimination following muchnik _ , universit de mons - hainaut , institute de mathmatique , preprint 10 , april 11 , 2002 , http://math.umh.ac.be/preprints/src/ozturk020411.pdf"
