    "although there are well established lower mass bounds for the standard higgs ( e.g. from lep searches @xcite ) , the situation may be different in several scenarios and models beyond the standard model ( sm ) where such constraints would not apply , leaving still room for light higgs bosons ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "needless to say , any possible experimental signal or discovery strategy of higgs - like particles should be examined with great attention . in this regard ,",
    "let us remind that the search for axions or light higgs in the decays of heavy resonances has several attractive features .",
    "firstly , the couplings of the former to fermions are proportional to their masses and therefore enhanced with respect to lighter mesons .",
    "second , theoretical predictions are more reliable , especially with the recent development of effective theories like non relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) @xcite , appropriate to deal with such bound states from first principles .",
    "indeed , intensive searches for a light higgs - like boson ( to be generically denoted by @xmath0 in this paper ) have been performed according to the so - called wilczek mechanism @xcite in the radiative decay of vector heavy quarkonia like the upsilon resonance ( i.e. @xmath1 ) .",
    "so far , none of all these searches has been successful , but have provided valuable constraints on the mass values of light higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this work i will focus on a possible signal of new physics based on the @xmath2apparent  breaking of lepton universality in bottomonium decays : _ stricto sensu _ , lepton universality implies that the electroweak couplings to gauge fields of all charged lepton species should be the same . according to the interpretation given in this work , the possible dependence on the leptonic mass of the leptonic branching fractions of @xmath3 resonances below the @xmath4 threshold ( if experimentally confirmed by forthcoming measurements )",
    "might be viewed as a hint of the existence of a higgs of mass about 10 gev .",
    "let us write the well known van royen - weisskopf formula including color , expressing the leptonic decay width of the @xmath5 vector resonance without neglecting leptonic masses : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant ; @xmath8 denotes the mass of the @xmath3 particle and @xmath9 is the charge of the bottom quark ( @xmath10 in units of @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 is the non - relativistic radial wave function of the @xmath13 bound state at the origin ; finally @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "let us note that @xmath16 is a decreasing function of @xmath17 : the higher leptonic mass the smaller decay rate .",
    "however , such @xmath17-dependence is quite weak for bottomonium .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the sequential decay @xmath18 it is a continuum radiative transition which in principle permits the coupling of the bottom quark - antiquark pair into a particle with @xmath19 : @xmath20 . in the present investigation",
    ", we will confine our attention to the two first possibilities : a scalar or a pseudoscalar boson .      in a vector resonance like the @xmath5",
    ", the heavy quark pair can be in a @xmath22 color - singlet state in the lowest fock state , but the @xmath23 system could also exist with other quantum numbers than @xmath24 since the soft degrees of freedom can carry the remaining quantum numbers , although with a smaller probability .",
    "these ideas have been cast into the rigorous formulation of nrqcd @xcite and extensively applied to heavy quarkonia production and decay .",
    "moreover , one can wonder about the possibility of reaching such fock states by emission of soft photons instead of soft gluons .",
    "let us note however a crucial difference between photons and gluons : the latter carry color and hence , there exists a lower cutoff corresponding to a minimum amount of energy @xmath2taken away  in the hadronization stage ( corresponding to a pion mass for instance )",
    ". however , this is not the case for photons .",
    "actually , the experimental determination of the leptonic braching fraction ( bf ) @xmath25 actually includes decays accompanied by a large number number of soft photons @xcite .    on the other hand , magnetic dipole ( m1 )",
    "transitions can connect spin - triplet and spin - singlet states by emission of soft photons from heavy quark lines ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the probability for this process can be obtained by dividing the corresponding width @xcite by by the total width of the resonance , @xmath26 kev @xcite , i.e. @xmath27}\\ = \\   \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{tot}}\\ \\frac{4\\alpha q_b^2}{3m_b^2}\\ k^3\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the energy of the soft photon @xmath29 varying in the range @xmath30 mev .",
    "let us also remark that soft photons in this experimental context are those whose energies do not exceed the experimental resolution and hence are actually not observed .",
    "machines are of the order of few tens of mev for the @xmath3 family below open bottom production",
    ". moreover , typical low energy cutoffs for photon detection are of the order of 50 mev .",
    "notice also that the use of eq ( 3 ) as an estimate for the magnetic dipole transition is justified since the respective wave - lengths of the radiated photons are quite larger than the size of quarkonium ( of order @xmath31 gev@xmath32 ) . ]",
    "let us focus on the bottomonium familly of @xmath33 states below open flavor ( i.e. @xmath34 ; the @xmath35 state is however discarded in the present analysis since only experimental data for the muonic channel @xcite are currently available ) decaying into a lepton pair plus a soft photon @xmath29 : @xmath36(\\rightarrow   \\phi^0{\\rightarrow}\\ \\ell^+\\ell^-)\\ \\ ; \\   \\ \\ell = e,\\mu,\\tau\\ ] ] where the soft ( i stress it once more : _ unobserved _ ) @xmath29 comes from a m1 transition of the @xmath3 resonance , as sketched in fig .",
    "i will write the decay width @xmath37 corresponding to the formation of an intermediate state followed by its annihilation via an scalar or pseudoscalar in the factored form : @xmath38 } \\times \\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\ell\\ell}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 stands for the annihilation width of the @xmath21 pair in a spin - singlet state into a lepton pair via a higgs ( @xmath0 ) boson as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "furthermore , fermions are assumed to couple to the @xmath0 field according to a yukawa interaction term in the effective lagrangian : @xmath40 where @xmath41 gev stands for the vacuum expectation value of the standard higgs boson ; @xmath42 denotes a factor depending on the type of the higgs boson , which could enhance the coupling with a fermion ( quark or lepton ) of type @xmath2@xmath43  .",
    "lastly , note that the @xmath44 matrix stands only in the case of a pseudoscalar @xmath0 field .    now , let us tentatively assume that the mass of the light higgs sought stands close to the @xmath45 resonance but below @xmath4 production : @xmath46 . as will be argued from current experimental data in the next section",
    ", i am supposing specifically that @xmath47 lies somewhere between the @xmath5 and @xmath48 masses , i.e. @xmath49    next , let us define the mass difference : @xmath50 , where @xmath3 denotes either a @xmath51 or a @xmath52 state . accepting for simplicity that the higgs stands halfway between the mass values of both resonances , @xmath53 gev for an order - of - magnitude calculation .",
    "hence the scalar tree - level @xmath0 propagator can be written approximately as @xmath54 where the width of the higgs boson has been neglected for it should be very narrow due the smallness of @xmath47 and , moreover , standing below bottom open production .",
    "finally , one can compare the relative rates by means of the following dimensionless ratio @xmath55 \\times \\frac{m_{\\ell}^2}{{\\delta}m^2}\\ ] ] where we are assuming that the main contribution to the leptonic channel comes from the photon exchange graph of fig .",
    "1.a . let us point out once again that since @xmath29 is undetected , the higgs contribution of figure 1.b would be experimentally ascribed to the leptonic channel of the @xmath3 resonance .    for the sake of a comparison with other higgs searches",
    ", i will identify the @xmath56 factor with the 2hdm ( type ii ) parameter for the universal down - type fermion coupling to a cp - odd higgs , i.e. @xmath57 , defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of two higgs fields @xcite .",
    "inserting numerical values , @xmath58 where use was made of the approximation @xmath59 gev , and the range @xmath60 mev for the soft photon energy @xmath28 ; @xmath61 is expressed in gev .",
    "from inspection of experimental data presented in table 1 , one realizes a slight but steady increase of the decay rate with the lepton mass . in spite of that ,",
    "current error bars ( @xmath62 ) are still too large ( especially in the case of the @xmath48 ) to permit a thorough check of the lepton mass dependence as expressed in eq.(9 ) .",
    "nevertheless , i will apply below a hypothesis test in order to draw , if possible , a statistically significant conclusion about lepton universality breaking . to this end ,",
    "i present in table 2 the differences @xmath63 divided by their respective errors @xmath64 , between bf s of distinct channels obtained from table 1 . then applying a _ one - tailed test _",
    "@xcite , i define the _ region of rejection _ above a preassigned _ critical value _ of the @xmath65 variable ( i.e. positive values if @xmath66 ) , assuming a normal distribution .",
    "[ htb ]    .branching fractions @xmath25 ( in @xmath67 ) of @xmath5 and @xmath48 leptonic decays ( from @xcite ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mean of the four @xmath68 values ( @xmath69 for both @xmath5 and @xmath5 resonances ) turns out to be @xmath70 .",
    "next , i define the _ test statistic _ :",
    "@xmath71 , where @xmath72 stands for the number of independent points .",
    "( note also that we are dealing with a gaussian of unity variance . ) choosing the _ critical value _ to be @xmath73 , the lepton universality hypothesis [ playing the role of the _ null hypothesis _ in our test , predicting a mean zero ( or slightly less ) value ] can be _ rejected _ at a _ significance level _ of 10@xmath67 since @xmath74 certainly , this result is not statistically significant enough to make any serious claim about the rejection of the lepton universality hypothesis in this particular process , but points out the interest to investigate further the alternative hypothesis stemming from eq.(9 ) .    in order to explain the observed @xmath75 enhancement from the electronic to the tauonic channel ( see table 1 ) , one gets @xmath76 depending on the value of @xmath28 , namely from 50 mev to 10 mev in ( 9 ) .",
    "a caveat is in order : the above interval is purely indicative as it only takes into account the probability range on the m1 transition estimated according to eq.(3 ) , and not other sources of uncertainty .",
    "it is also worthwhile to remark that the interval ( 9 ) is compatible with the range needed to interpret the @xmath77 muon anomaly in terms of a light cp - odd higgs ( @xmath78 ) resulting from a two - loop calculation @xcite .",
    "calculation the discrepancy with respect to the sm becomes smaller than initially expected @xcite . ]",
    "i have pointed out in this paper a possible breaking of lepton universality in @xmath3 leptonic decays , interpreted in terms of a neutral cp - odd higgs of mass around @xmath79 gev , introducing a @xmath80 dependent contribution in the partial width .",
    "i end by emphasizing the interest in more accurate data on leptonic bf s of @xmath3 resonances , particularly considering the exciting possibility of a signal of new physics as pointed out in this work .",
    "hopefully , b factories working below open bottom production will provide in a near future new and likely more precise measurements of the leptonic bf s for the @xmath3 family .",
