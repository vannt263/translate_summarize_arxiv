    "the solar neutrino problem @xcite may allow for new break through in our understanding of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the precise knowledge of the astrophysical @xmath1-factor of the @xmath2be(p,@xmath3)@xmath4b reaction at the gamow peak , about 20 kev , is of crucial importance for interpreting terrestrial measurements of the solar neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for the interpretation of results from the homestake , kamiokande , superkamiokande and sno experiments  @xcite which measured high energy solar neutrinos mainly or solely from @xmath4b decay .",
    "eight direct measurements were reported for the @xmath2be(p,@xmath3)@xmath4b reaction  @xcite .",
    "since the cross section at @xmath5  20  kev is too small to be measured , the @xmath1-factors at low energies have to be extrapolated from the experimental data with the help of theoretical models ( see e.g. johnson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , jennings _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . but also in the energy range above @xmath5  100  kev , where measurements can be performed , experimental difficulties , mainly connected with the determination of the effective target thickness of the radioactive @xmath2be target , hamper the derivation of accurate results .",
    "these difficulties are reflected in the fact that the six precise measurements  @xcite can be grouped into two distinct data sets which agree in their energy dependence but disagree in their absolute normalization by about 30% . since",
    "this discrepancy is larger than the error of adopted @xmath1 in the standard solar model , experimental studies with different methods are highly desirable for improving the reliability of the input to the standard solar model  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the world data including our new gsi measurement of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from this figure that if we are to quote @xmath6 with an accuracy of @xmath7 , many more experiments using different methods are required .",
    "world data on @xmath1 as reported by our gsi collabortion @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in the measured absolute value of the cross section of the 7pg reaction is quite possibly best addressed with a @xmath8 radioactive beam and a hydrogen target , allowing for a direct measurement of the beam - target luminosity as we propose to do at lln .",
    "however , additional uncertainty exists in the theoretical extrapolation of the measured cross section to solar energies ( approximately 20 kev ) .",
    "a few theoretical studies suggest an extrapolation procedure that is accurate to approximately @xmath9 @xcite . without discussing these rather strong statements we consider a similar situation that haunted nuclear astrophysics a few years back the s - factor of the @xmath10 reaction .",
    "it was assumed that in this case d - waves dominate and no nuclear structure effects should play a role at very low energy , as low as 100 kev .",
    "much in the same way , it is stated today that s - waves dominate the 7pg reaction and we do not expect nuclear structure effects to play a role at low energies in the 7pg reaction . in fig .",
    "2 we show fowler s extrapolated d - wave s - factor that is a mere factor of 32 smaller than measured , due to a small non d - wave component in the d + d interaction @xcite . a small nuclear structure effect , namely the d - wave component of the ground state of @xmath11 , gives rise to a change by a factor of 32 in the predicted astrophysical s - factor .",
    "similarly we may ask whether a small non s - wave component in the low energy interaction of p + 7 could alter the extrapolated @xmath6 value by considerably more than one percent .",
    "a measurement of @xmath6 with an accuracy of @xmath7 mandates that the cross section be measured at low energies , as low as possible , so as to also test the extrapolation procedures .",
    "extrapolation of d - wave s - factor of the @xmath10 reaction@xcite .",
    "note the presence of small non d - wave components that yield a discrepancy from fowler s extracted s - factor by a factor of 32 .",
    "the coulomb dissociation ( cd ) @xcite is a primakoff @xcite process that could be viewed in first order as the time reverse of the radiative capture reaction . in this case instead of studying for example the fusion of a proton plus a nucleus ( a-1 ) , one studies the disintegration of the final nucleus ( a ) in the coulomb field , to a proton plus the ( a-1 ) nucleus .",
    "the reaction is made possible by the absorption of a virtual photon from the field of a high z nucleus such as @xmath13 . in this case since @xmath14 for a photon is approximately 1000 times larger than that of a particle beam , the small cross section is enhanced . the large virtual photon flux ( typically 100 - 1000 photons per collision )",
    "also gives rise to enhancement of the cross section .",
    "our understanding of the coulomb dissociation process @xcite allows us to extract the inverse nuclear process even when it is very small .",
    "however in coulomb dissociation since @xmath15 approaches unity ( unlike the case in electron scattering ) , higher order coulomb effects ( coulomb post acceleration ) may be non - negligible and they need to be understood @xcite .",
    "the success of cd experiments @xcite is in fact contingent on understanding such effects and designing the kinematical conditions so as to minimize such effects .",
    "hence the coulomb dissociation process has to be measured with great care with kinematical conditions carefully adjusted so as to minimize nuclear interactions ( i.e. distance of closest approach considerably larger then 20 fm , or very small forward angles scattering ) , and measurements must be carried out at high enough energies ( many tens of mev / u ) so as to maximize the virtual photon flux .",
    "the rikenii measurement  @xcite of detailed angular distributions for the coulomb dissociation of 8 allowed us to extract the e2 amplitude in the cd of 8 .",
    "the same data also allowed us to extract values for @xmath1 as recently published @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16pb target and @xmath4b beam properties in this experiment were as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the detector system covered a large angular range up to around 9@xmath17 to be sensitive to the e2 amplitude .",
    "the e1 and e2 virtual photon fluxes were calculated @xcite using quantum mechanical approach . the nuclear amplitude is evaluated based on the collective form factor where the deformation length is taken to be the same as the coulomb one .",
    "this nuclear contribution results in possible uncertainties in the fitted e2 amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , the present results lead to a very small e2 component at low energies , below 1.5 mev , of the order of a few percent , even smaller than the low value predicted by typel and baur @xcite and considerably below the upper limit on the e2 component extracted by gai and bertulani @xcite from the rikeni data .",
    "these low values of the e2 amplitude were however recently challenged by the msu group @xcite that used interference between e1 and e2 components to observe an asymmetry of the longitudinal - momentum distribution of @xmath2be @xcite .",
    "they @xcite claim : @xmath18/@xmath19 at 0.63 mev .",
    "these results are considerably larger than reported by kikuchi _",
    "@xcite , and just below the upper limit reported by gai and bertulani @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of the rikenii data @xcite by bertulni and gai @xcite confirmed the small e2 extracted by kikuchi et al .",
    "@xcite as well as the negligible nuclear contribution .",
    "note that in this analysis @xcite the acceptance of the rikenii detector is taken into account using the matrix generated by kikuchi _",
    "recently a possible mechanism to reduce the e2 dissociation amplitude was proposed by esbensen and bertsch @xcite .",
    "an experiment to measure the coulomb dissociation of @xmath4b at a higher energy of 254  @xmath20  mev was performed at gsi @xcite .",
    "the present experimental conditions have several advantages : ( i ) forward focusing allows us to use the magnetic spectrometer kaos  @xcite at gsi for a kinematically complete measurement with high detection efficiency over a wider range of the p-@xmath2be relative energy ;",
    "( ii ) because of the smaller influence of straggling on the experimental resolution at the higher energy , a thicker target can be used for compensating the weaker beam intensity , ( iii ) effects that obscure the contribution of e1 multipolarity to the coulomb dissociation like e2 admixtures and higher - order contributions are reduced  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of m1 multipolarity is expected to be enhanced at the higher energy , but this allows to observe the m1 resonance peak and determine its @xmath3 width .",
    "a @xmath4b beam was produced by fragmentation of a 350  @xmath20  mev @xmath21c beam from the sis synchrotron at gsi that impinged on a beryllium target with a thickness of 8.01 g/@xmath22 .",
    "the beam was isotopically separated by the fragment separator ( frs )  @xcite by using an aluminum degrader with a thickness of 1.46 g/@xmath22 with a wedge angle of 3 mrad .",
    "the beam was transported to the standard target - position of the spectrometer kaos  @xcite .",
    "the average beam energy of @xmath4b in front of the breakup target was 254.5  @xmath20  mev , a typical @xmath4b intensity was 10@xmath23 /spill ( 7s / spill ) .",
    "beam - particle identification was achieved event by event with the tof-@xmath24 method by using a beam - line plastic scintillator with a thickness of 5 mm placed 68 m upstream from the target and a large - area scintillator wall discussed later placed close to the focal plane of kaos .",
    "about 20 % of the beam particles were @xmath2be , which could however unambiguously be discriminated from breakup @xmath2be particles by their time of flight .    an enriched @xmath16pb target with a thickness of 199.7 ( @xmath25 0.2 ) mg/@xmath22 was placed at the entrance of kaos . the average energy at the center of the target amounted to 254.0  @xmath20  mev .",
    "the reaction products , @xmath2be and proton , were analyzed by the spectrometer which has a large momentum acceptance of @xmath26  % and an angular acceptance of 140 and 280  mrad in horizontal and vertical directions , respectively . for scattering - angle measurement or track reconstruction of the two reaction products ,",
    "two pairs of silicon micro - strip detectors were installed at about 14 and 31  cm downstream from the target , respectively , measuring either x- or y - position of the products before entering the kaos magnets .",
    "each strip detector had a thickness of 300  @xmath27 m , an active area of 56 @xmath28 56 mm@xmath29 , and a strip pitch of 0.1 mm .",
    "the measured complete kinematics of the breakup products allowed us to reconstruct the p-@xmath2be relative energy and the scattering angle @xmath30 of the center - of - mass of proton and @xmath2be ( excited @xmath4b ) with respect to the incoming beam from the individual momenta and angles of the breakup products .",
    "to evaluate the response of the detector system , monte - carlo simulations were performed using the code geant@xcite .",
    "the simulations took into account the measured @xmath4b beam spread in energy , angle , and position at the target , as well as the influence of angular and energy straggling and energy loss in the layers of matter .",
    "losses of the products due to limited detector sizes were also accounted for .",
    "further corrections in the simulation are due to the feeding of the excited state at 429  kev in @xmath2be .",
    "we used the result by kikuchi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who measured the @xmath3-decay in coincidence with coulomb dissociation of @xmath4b at 51.9  @xmath20  mev .",
    "the monte carlo simulations yielded relative - energy resolutions from the energy and angular resolutions of the detection system to be 0.11 and 0.22  mev ( 1@xmath31 ) at @xmath32 and 1.8 mev , respectively . the total efficiency calculated by the simulation",
    "was found to be larger than 50% at @xmath33  mev . due to the large acceptance of kaos .",
    "( a , b , c ) yields of breakup events plotted against @xmath30 , the scattering angle of the excited @xmath4b , for three relative energy bins .",
    "the full histograms show the results of a simulation taking into account the measured angular spread of the incident @xmath4b beam ( shown in d ) and assuming e1+m1 multipolarity .",
    "the dashed histograms show the simulated results for e2 contribution according to the calculations of bertulani and gai@xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 , the experimental yield is plotted against the scattering angle of the excited @xmath4b for three relative - energy bins , 0.3@xmath340.5 ( a ) , 0.5@xmath340.7 ( b ) , and 1.0@xmath341.2 ( c ) mev , together with results of the monte - carlo simulations assuming e1 excitation .",
    "the m1 transition also contributes to the 0.5@xmath340.7 mev bin with the same angular dependence .",
    "since we did not measure the incident angle of @xmath4b at the target , the experimental angular - distributions represent the @xmath30 distributions folded with the angular spread of the incident beam shown in fig .",
    "the angular resolution was estimated to be 0.35@xmath35 ( 1@xmath31 ) , smaller than the observed widths . as seen in fig .",

    ", we have added the simulated e2 angular distribution from the e2 coulomb dissociation cross section calculated by bertulani and gai @xcite .",

    "we propose to measure the cross section of the 7pg reaction with the use of 7 beams produced at louvain - la - neuve ( lln ) @xcite .",

    "thus the stopped 8 are designed to be equally spread over the two aluminum catcher foils ( 0.5 @xmath52 each ) .",
    "the beta - delayed alpha - particle emission of 8 will be measured by measuring coincidence between the two back to back equal energy alpha - particles detected in a pair of detectors , see fig .",

    "two monitors measure beam intensity by measuring the elastic scattering off a thin au foil ( evaporated onto a very thin carbon backing ) and the recoil protons off the target . we plan to measure @xmath53 for p + 7 with high precision .",
    "thus the cross section of the 7pg reaction will be measured relative to the elastic scattering , thereby removing several systematic uncertainties related to beam - target composition .",
    "the hydrogen component of the target will be continuously monitored by measuring the recoil protons from the target .",
    "these measurements will allow us to continuously measure and monitor the beam - target luminosity .",
    "since two alpha - particles are associated with that decay we expect a very large detection efficiency , approximately 50% of @xmath54 .",
    "our extensive monte carlo simulations yield a large ( 98% ) coincidence efficiency and thus approximately 50% total coincidence efficiency for two equal energy correlated back to back alpha - particles . for a 8 transfer time of 0.07 sec ,",
    "every 0.5 sec , we obtain a total alpha - particle detection efficiency of approximately 25% . the closed detection geometry ( 50% of 4@xmath55 ) with a front and back detectors ( a - la calorimetry style ) also ensures that the total alpha detection efficiency is nearly independent of the exact location of the collection foils , as long as the two foils remain parallel and at constant distance and the recoil 8 nuclei are spread equally on both catcher foils .    a beam intensity of @xmath56 and a 250 @xmath57 target ( @xmath58 ) containing @xmath59 yield a luminosity of @xmath60 .",
    "with expected cross sections of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , at @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev , respectively , and alpha - particle detection efficiency of 25% , we obtain count rates of approximately 5 , 4 , and 2 counts per hour . thus experiments lasting two to three days at @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev , respectively , will yield a total count of 240 , 192 and 144 counts and statistical uncertainties of 6.4% , 7.2% and 8.3% , respectively . with approved 9 days of experiment",
