    "it has been the experience of physicists that exceptional gauge groups do not arise in the perturbative open string setting .",
    "the traditional chan - paton construction allows open strings to carry only unitary , unitary - symplectic , and orthogonal gauge groups @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was corroborated recently in a general analysis based on classical open string field theory .",
    "the analysis established that if open strings carry a symmetry structure without spacetime interpretation , unitarity and ghost number constraints require the classical theory to be on - shell equivalent to a theory with a chan - paton gauge group @xcite .",
    "generalized chan - paton constructions are possible .",
    "open superstring theories with d - branes and/or orientifold projections can give rise to somewhat more intricate gauge groups and matter content , but again , no exceptional gauge groups were encountered @xcite .",
    "we recently classified a class of generalized chan - paton constructions starting with the assumption that the open string state space decomposes into sectors that multiply according to a semigroup @xcite .",
    "we showed that open string consistency requires the semigroup to be a brandt semigroup , and the known classification of those semigroups indicates that such open string theories have the structure of theories with d - branes , carrying possibly some additional structure .",
    "it is not clear whether or not this structure could be used to generate novel theories of open strings .    there exists , however , a natural setup where an open - string interpretation for exceptional gauge groups has been investigated @xcite .",
    "string has been recently constructed as a soliton of type i @xcite . ]",
    "this setup is that of iib superstrings compactified on a two - sphere @xmath0 in a background of parallel 7-branes which extend in the uncompactified directions and are points on the two - sphere .",
    "such compactifications can be viewed as f - theory compactifications on an elliptically fibered k3 , where the base is @xmath0 and the fiber is a two - torus @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the complex structure of the @xmath1 varies as one moves on the base , and the points where this complex structure becomes singular represent the positions of the 7-branes in the iib context .",
    "twenty four such points are required in order to have a smooth k3 , and it becomes singular only when the points coalesce .",
    "when this happens , non - contractible two - cycles shrink to zero size .",
    "the singularities of elliptic k3 s can be of @xmath2-type , @xmath3-type or @xmath4-type , and are labeled in this way because the intersection numbers between collapsing two - cycles generate the cartan matrices associated to the lie algebras @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "an f - theory background with an @xmath6 singularity corresponds to a configuration of @xmath7 mutually local 7-branes in iib string theory , giving rise to a @xmath8 gauge theory by means of conventional open strings ending on the 7-branes .",
    "the case of a @xmath9 singularity was considered very explicitly by sen @xcite , who showed that in the perturbative regime this theory was equivalent to a iib orientifold with four coincident d7 branes , and by a duality transformation , equivalent to a type i open string theory . in the non - perturbative regime",
    "the orientifold is resolved into two 7-branes , which are nonlocal with respect to each other and the other four 7-branes . following the analysis of sen , f - theory backgrounds involving @xmath10 , and @xmath11 singularities",
    "were presented by dasgupta and mukhi @xcite .",
    "the explicit brane description of the exceptional singularities as a iib background of mutually nonlocal 7-branes was given by johansen @xcite , who also described candidates for the open strings corresponding to the gauge vectors of the resulting exceptional groups .    in the above description of the @xmath12 gauge algebra , an @xmath13 gauge subalgebra",
    "is realized manifestly by _ conventional _ open strings stretching between mutually local 7-branes .",
    "the other generators of the exceptional algebra are believed to arise as _ essentially conventional _",
    "open strings stretching along nontrivial paths between sometimes mutually nonlocal branes ; this requires that the open string crosses suitable branch - cuts that convert the string into an @xmath14 transform that can end on the final 7-brane .",
    "there are shortcomings , however , that prevent this from being a clear open string description of exceptional groups . in the standard description ,",
    "the charges carried by an open string are determined by the branes it ends on . in the above description the candidate open strings for",
    "the non - manifest generators must carry charges of branes they do not end on . moreover",
    ", the multiplication of open strings does not work in a natural way .",
    "open strings corresponding to generators whose lie bracket does not vanish are seen not to have common endpoints that would allow one to combine them in the usual fashion .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to provide an open - string description of exceptional groups that avoids these difficulties .",
    "we do not modify the 7-brane configurations described above , but we propose that the fundamental objects that are necessary include not only open strings having two endpoints , but also multi - pronged open strings having more than two endpoints .",
    "these @xmath7-pronged open strings are built from open string junctions . since they have @xmath7 free endpoints , they can be charged with respect to @xmath7 gauge groups .",
    "we will describe the multi - pronged open strings representing manifestly the hitherto non - manifest additional generators of the exceptional algebra , show that they have the desired charges , and that they can be combined by joining the prongs in the usual open string theory way .    actually , the multi - pronged open strings are naturally related to conventional ( two - pronged ) open strings .",
    "a three - pronged string can arise when an ordinary string looping around a 7-brane it can not end on , crosses the 7-brane , and in the process a one - brane or an extra prong is created .",
    "this new prong is necessary for charge conservation and arises in a way that is completely analogous to the way new branes are created in the hanany - witten effect @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the two processes are related by u - duality , see also @xcite . )",
    "the two desciptions that can be obtained from one another by a crossing of branes describe the same bps state in different regions of the moduli space of the positions of the 7-branes .",
    "three string junctions have been considered before by schwarz @xcite who suggested that they represent bps configurations and anticipated their physical relevance .",
    "it is perhaps not too speculative to suggest that our results point to a possible non - perturbative formulation of open string theory based on open strings and their multi - pronged versions .",
    "the world sheet of a multi - pronged string is a two dimensional manifold except at the world line of the common endpoint .",
    "moreover , in the covariant open string theory of witten @xcite where the string midpoint is singled out , an open string is naturally a two - pronged string .",
    "finally , just as open string endpoints can join to form closed strings , joining all endpoints of several @xmath15-pronged open strings give objects that would look as polyhedral closed string junctions , objects that are formally reminiscent of the closed string polyhedra defining classical closed string field theory @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce notation , discuss open string junctions , and explain how they can arise as branes cross .",
    "we also review the configurations of 7-branes that are necessary for exceptional groups , and the embeddings of the perturbative subalgebras . in section  3 ,",
    "we study some of the open string geodesics that represent bps states .",
    "the generators of the exceptional groups are constructed in section  4 , where we also analyze their multiplication , and explain how they are related to ordinary geodesics .",
    "section  5 contains some conclusions and open questions .",
    "let us consider iib string theory compactified on a two - sphere in the presence of a set of parallel 7-branes which appear as points on the two - sphere .",
    "the iib theory has different 7-branes which are labeled by @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are relatively prime .",
    "the theory also possesses different strings which are similarly labeled by @xmath19 , where again @xmath17 and @xmath18 are relatively prime , and a @xmath19-string can end on a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane . and",
    "@xmath20 strings only differ by orientation , the @xmath20 string can also end on a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane . ]",
    "we choose the convention that the elementary string is @xmath21 , and the d - string is @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath19 strings can then be thought of as bound states of @xmath17 elementary strings and @xmath18 d - strings @xcite .",
    "the ordinary d7-brane has labels @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "suppose that an elementary string ends on an ordinary d7-brane . using the @xmath14 transformation with the matrix @xmath24",
    ", we can translate the string into a @xmath19 string = g_p , q , g_p , q = , ps - qr=1 .",
    "after this transformation the @xmath19 string ends on a 7-brane which must be , by definition , a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane . we must therefore view a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane as the @xmath14 transform with @xmath24 of the ordinary @xmath23 $ ] d7-brane .",
    "concretely , the transformation can be thought of as the transformation of the background fields that define the brane .    as discussed in @xcite",
    "the @xmath14 matrix @xmath24 is not uniquely determined by the integers @xmath25 , but presumably this non - uniqueness has no physical consequences .",
    "this can be seen explicitly as far as the monodromy associated to the @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane is concerned .",
    "indeed , going around an ordinary d7 brane induces an @xmath14 transformation of the doublet of background ns and rr antisymmetric tensors via the matrix t= = m_1,0 which is the monodromy @xmath26 of the @xmath23 $ ] d7-brane .",
    "this then implies that the monodromy matrix of the @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane is [ genmon ] m_p , q = g_p , q t g_p , q^-1 = , which depends only on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath27 .",
    "if we introduce the complex combination @xmath28 of the dilaton field @xmath29 and the axion field @xmath30 , then @xmath31 transforms under an @xmath14 transformation @xmath32 as , g= . in order to keep track of the different monodromies",
    "we shall only draw the two - sphere on which the 7-brane is a point , and we shall introduce appropriate branch cuts . we shall choose the convention that if an @xmath33 string crosses in an anti - clockwise direction the branch cut of a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane , it is turned into a @xmath34 string ; this is described in figure  1 .",
    "it is simple to show that @xmath19 is the only eigenvector of @xmath35 , and that the corresponding eigenvalue is one .",
    "this is sensible for it says that only a @xmath19 string can go around a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane without being changed .",
    "let us next analyze under which conditions three string junctions are allowed .",
    "suppose that three oriented open strings @xmath36 , @xmath37 form a three string junction , where , as always , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are relatively prime .",
    "as explained in @xcite , charge conservation implies then that the charges of the three strings must satisfy [ chcons ]    lcl p_1 + p_2 + p_3 & = & 0 , + q_1 + q_2 + q_3 & = & 0 .",
    "it is however not clear whether this condition is already sufficient .",
    "in fact , one may also want to require that a junction is only allowed if one of the strings participating in the junction can end on another one , and in the following we shall also impose this condition .",
    "it is known that the fundamental string @xmath40 can end on the d - string @xmath41 . using the @xmath14 transformation",
    "@xmath42 , this then implies that a @xmath43 string can end on a @xmath33 string .",
    "we therefore conclude    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a _ @xmath19 _ string can end on a _",

    "if @xmath43 can end on @xmath33 , then it can also end on the outgoing @xmath45 string of the three string junction ( whose charges are determined by ( [ chcons ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the relation is symmetric : if @xmath19 can end on @xmath33 , then @xmath33 can end on @xmath19 .",
    "we shall therefore say that two types of strings are _ compatible _ if they can end on one another .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that under suitable conditions on the geometry of the junction , the resulting configuration should be bps .",
    "higher string junctions should also exist ; for example , four - string junctions should arise when the intermediate string joining two allowed three - string junctions collapses .",
    "similar considerations should also apply to higher string junctions .",
    "at present , we do not know if these are all the allowed @xmath46 string junctions .",
    "next we want to explain that the three - string junction arises naturally when a suitable string crosses a 7-brane .",
    "the effect is actually u - dual to the hanany - witten effect @xcite ; for the case of an d - string @xmath47 and an d7-brane @xmath23 $ ] this follows from the arguments in @xcite",
    ". the general case can then be deduced by @xmath48 transformations .",
    "suppose then that an @xmath49 string is crossing the branch cut of a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane on which it is not allowed to end , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath50 .",
    "if the @xmath49 string is compatible with the @xmath51 strings that can end on the 7-brane , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , an interesting possibility arises : as the @xmath49-string crosses the 7-brane , a @xmath51-string is created that joins the @xmath49 string to the 7-brane ; this is represented pictorially in figure  2 .",
    "we should mention that the incoming and outgoing charges of the string are the same for both representations .",
    "this follows from the equation m_p , q = + e , which in turn can be derived with the help of ( [ genmon ] ) .",
    "the two different representations are different descriptions of the same bps state ; as in the hanany - witten effect they are valid in different regions of the moduli space of positions of the 7-branes .      in both the type iib picture of compactification on @xmath0 and on the equivalent f - theory picture of an elliptically fibered k3 with base @xmath0 ,",
    "topological consistency conditions require a total of 24 7-branes .",
    "as the branes approach each other we get singularities that give rise to enhanced gauge symmetries .",
    "in one familiar configuration the branes fall into four bunches of six branes each , each bunch defining a @xmath9 singularity of k3 and giving rise to an @xmath54 gauge algebra @xcite .",
    "the six 7-branes on each bunch can be viewed as four ordinary @xmath23 $ ] d7-branes , to be denoted as @xmath55-branes , one @xmath56 $ ] 7-brane ( @xmath57-brane ) , and one @xmath58 $ ] 7-brane ( @xmath59-brane)$ ] labels to the 7-branes differs by an irrelevant overall sl(2,z ) transformation from the assignments used in refs.@xcite . ]",
    "[ brdef ] a : [ 1,0 ] , b : [ 3,-1 ] , c : [ 1,-1 ] .",

    "let us denote by @xmath60 and @xmath61 the number of @xmath55 , @xmath57 and @xmath59 branes , respectively .",
    "then we have for @xmath54 [ soeight ] so(8 ) : n_a = 4 , n_b= 1 , n_c = 1 .",
    "as we encircle successively the @xmath59 , @xmath57 and four @xmath55 branes , we obtain an effective monodromy [ basmon ] a^4 bc = - .",

    "the open strings joining the same types of branes along trivial paths generate the gauge algebra @xmath63 . in the following",
    "we shall mostly ignore the @xmath64 factor which arises by some mixing of the @xmath64 factors that are associated to the different groups of branes .",
    "for the different singularities on k3 , the corresponding configurations of ( mutually non - local ) 7-branes can be determined .",

    "in the iib superstring approach to exceptional gauge groups of ref.@xcite , the gauge vectors arise as geodesics on the compactifying two - sphere whose endpoints are 7-branes .",
    "the property of the different paths to be geodesics is somewhat difficult to analyze , and it was only checked numerically in @xcite .    in this section",
    "we shall take some small steps that improve this situation",
    ". we will be able to show on general grounds that certain classes of geodesics , for specific regions of the moduli of positions of the 7-branes , exist . however , not even these ( simple ) classes of geodesics seem to exist for completely arbitrary positions of the 7-branes .",
    "this is in accord with our proposal that the conventional open strings do not represent the relevant bps states throughout the whole moduli spaces of positions of the 7-branes . rather , there exist various regions of the moduli space where the relevant bps states correspond to multi - pronged strings .    from the f - theory point of view , the ordinary open string geodesics correspond to two - spheres with two marked points ( which are the locations of the 7-branes , where the torus degenerates ) .",
    "our @xmath7-pronged open string configurations are the natural generalization to two - spheres with @xmath7 marked points ; the locations of the open string junctions themselves do not represent degenerate tori .",
    "similar configurations have also been considered before in a slightly different context in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the geodesics that we aim to understand are geodesics on a two - sphere with a special metric .",

    "taking @xmath123 to be the complex coordinate on @xmath0 , the k3 is described by the equation [ efibr ] y^2 = x^3 + f(z ) x + g(z ) , which defines a torus with a complex structure for each value of @xmath123 .",
    "here @xmath124 and @xmath32 are polynomials of degree eight and twelve , respectively , and the complex structure of the torus @xmath125 is implicitly defined by the equation [ modfix ] j((z ) ) = 4(24f)^3/ , 27g^2 + 4f^3 = _",

    "it is straightforward to show that this metric is invariant under @xmath14 transformations of @xmath31 .",

    "the metric ( [ effmet ] ) is typically rather complicated , but in some cases the metric behaves ( at least at large distance ) as if it had a conical singularity . by",
    "this one means that @xmath132 is of the form [ asymp ] h_p , q(z ) = z^-2 ( c + c z + ) , where @xmath133 is the defect angle , and we have assumed , for simplicity , that the conical singularity is at @xmath134 . here the expression in parenthesis is simply the expansion of an analytic function that is regular at the origin .",
    "in particular , the metric ( [ effmet ] ) is of this form if the term @xmath135 is a constant ( as a function of @xmath123 ) , and all 7-branes are located at @xmath136 .    to proceed",
    "let us consider the configuration of a fundamental string in the vicinity of a @xmath23 $ ] d7-brane , which , for convenience we place at @xmath134 .",

    "we can next consider the case where a @xmath21 string loops around a collection of @xmath140 branes located in the vicinity of @xmath134 .",

    "this implies that @xmath142 , and the group of @xmath140 branes creates a conical singularity that corresponds to a deficit angle of @xmath143 .",
    "the above considerations can be used to discuss the nature of @xmath144 and @xmath145 geodesics that encircle some number of 7-branes . as we shall see , in suitable limits we can describe both kinds of geodesics as geodesics on a cone with defect angle @xmath146 .",
    "this is effectively an orientifold description .",
    "let us first consider the case of @xmath144 geodesics .",
    "the different ( potential ) geodesics that begin and end on an @xmath55 brane fall into two classes , the _ direct _ and the _ indirect _ paths .",
    "the former are all paths which do not cut any branch cuts , and the indirect paths are those which begin on @xmath55 , go around a @xmath59 brane , a @xmath57 brane , and then end again on an @xmath55 brane .",
    "these geodesics are for example relevant for the brane configuration of @xmath54 which requires four @xmath55 branes , one @xmath57 brane and one @xmath59 brane . in this case",
    ", if all six branes coincide in a point , ( [ basmon ] ) implies that the effective monodromy of the complete configuration is minus the identity matrix . in the notation of ( [ parmon ] ) we then have @xmath147 and the metric for the fundamental string has a conical singularity with defect angle @xmath146 .    as we remove the @xmath55 branes from the collapsed configuration the defect angle for the @xmath148 metric does not change .",
    "this follows for example from the fact that an @xmath55 brane does not represent any singularity for the fundamental @xmath21 string .",
    "we can also check this explicitly , as @xmath149 is of the form ( [ parmon ] ) with @xmath150 , and thus @xmath151 giving again the defect angle of @xmath146 .",
    "the situation for @xmath145 strings is similar .",
    "again there exist the direct paths , and the indirect paths encircle four @xmath55 branes and one @xmath57 brane , whose effective monodromy is @xmath152 .",
    "it is convenient to perform an @xmath14 transformation @xmath153 which turns the @xmath59-brane into a conventional @xmath23 $ ] d7-brane .",
    "the effective monodromy of the group of five 7-branes is then @xmath154 , which is of the form ( [ parmon ] ) with @xmath155 .",
    "altogether we therefore have again a conical singularity with a defect angle of @xmath146 ( as @xmath156 ) .",
    "the geometry of geodesics in a cone of defect angle @xmath146 is simple to understand . between any two branes",
    "located away from the apex there are two geodesics , one ` direct ' geodesic which would become trivial should the branes approach each other , and the ` indirect ' geodesic which goes around the other side of the cone . as long as the two @xmath55 branes are not contained on the same radial line away from the apex , both geodesics avoid the apex . on the other hand ,",
    "the indirect geodesics going from a brane to itself will necessarily go through the apex , and their existence is therefore questionable .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath7 branes in the vicinity of a cone of defect angle @xmath146 , we get @xmath157 direct geodesics ( distinguishing orientation ) and @xmath158 indirect geodesics .",
    "this analysis applies directly only to the situation , where for the @xmath144 strings , @xmath57 and @xmath59 coincide ( and for the @xmath145 string , the four @xmath55s and @xmath57 coincide ) .",
    "if we separate @xmath57 and @xmath59 , then the above picture is only approximately true whenever we are far away from the region around the apex . in the regions of moduli space where this approximation is not valid , some of the geodesics are likely to become questionable , and it seems plausible that open string junctions become the relevant objects .",
    "in this section we shall analyze the various different geodesics ( and their representatives involving string junctions ) which are relevant for the description of the exceptional groups .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the direct geodesics between the @xmath55 branes and between the @xmath59 branes account for the `` manifest '' gauge subgroup . here",
    "we shall only consider the additional generators .",
    "we shall demonstrate that these generators have the correct charges , and that they multiply correctly in order to account for the structure of the exceptional groups .",
    "we shall start by considering the indirect @xmath144 strings in more detail . as explained before",
    ", these geodesics start on an @xmath55 brane , encircle a @xmath59 brane and a @xmath57 brane anti - clockwise , and end on a different @xmath55 brane ; this is shown in fig .  3 ( a ) . from now on we shall always use the convention that heavy dots represent @xmath55 branes , small circles represent @xmath57 branes , and small squares represent @xmath59 branes .",
    "the dotted lines that emanate from the 7-brane represent the corresponding branch cut , and the strings that begin or end at a @xmath16 $ ] 7-brane are always @xmath19 strings .    the configuration in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) is allowed as the monodromy of @xmath59 and @xmath57 transforms the @xmath21 string that starts at the right @xmath55 brane into a @xmath159 string that arrives at the left @xmath55 brane ; this is equivalent to a @xmath21 string departing from the left @xmath55 brane .",
    "we note that both @xmath55 branes have departing @xmath21 strings .",
    "as explained in the previous section , only those paths are geodesics , for which the string begins and ends on different @xmath55 branes .",
    "this can now also be understood pictorially : we can compose the strings in fig .  3 ( a ) with ` direct ' @xmath144 strings ( which represent the gauge bosons of @xmath120 ) , and the fact that the string in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) departs from both @xmath55 branes implies that the different strings transform as the antisymmetric tensor representation of @xmath120 .    on the other hand , for fixed @xmath55 endpoints , there",
    "exist @xmath61 different such configurations , depending on which @xmath59 brane is encircled .",
    "one should expect that the indirect @xmath144 strings transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath160 ( which is generated by the direct @xmath145 strings ) , but since the configurations of fig .  3 ( a ) do not have any endpoints on a @xmath59 brane this is not manifest .",
    "= 3.5 cm    = 3.7 cm    = 3.3 cm    = 3.0 cm    = 3.7 cm    we can now , however , change the presentation by letting the open string cross the @xmath59 brane it encloses .",
    "this is allowed by the rule described in fig .  2 as the @xmath41 string is compatible with the @xmath161 string associated to a @xmath59 brane .",
    "after crossing we get the extra open string prong emerging from the @xmath59 brane , and we have obtained a three - string junction as a representation of the bps state ; this is illustrated in fig .  3 ( b ) .",
    "in this presentation the fact that the states transform as fundamentals of @xmath160 is now manifest , as we have an open string ending on the @xmath59 brane , and the states compose naturally with direct @xmath145 strings .",
    "additional presentations are possible by doing further moves",
    ". we can go from ( a ) to ( c ) by pushing the open string across the @xmath59 brane that is not enclosed ; this leads to a diagram where the prong goes into the @xmath59 brane .",
    "two more presentations that are useful are shown in ( d ) and ( e ) , both of which follow by crossing the @xmath57 brane in presentation ( b ) .",
    "the complex conjugate representation is described by exactly the same diagrams with the exception that the arrows are reversed .",
    "thus , for example , while fig .",
    "3 ( a ) represents the @xmath162 for the case of @xmath65 , the same figure with the @xmath21 strings going into the @xmath55 branes would represent the @xmath163 .",
    "this is sensible on various accounts .",
    "first and foremost , the diagrams with arrows reversed are consistent if the original representations are consistent : reversal of arrows is compatible with charge conservation at junctions and with the crossing of branch cuts . by construction",
    "they represent the same number of states as the original representation , and finally we can combine a representation with its complex conjugate by gluing the string prongs at all 7-branes to obtain a singlet .      as can be seen from the table given in section 2 ,",
    "the non - manifest generators of @xmath65 include the @xmath144 states considered above and transforming as @xmath164 of @xmath165 , and , in addition , states transforming as @xmath166 .",
    "these are states that can be represented as open strings beginning and ending on @xmath59 branes , and enclosing four @xmath55 branes and one @xmath57 brane @xcite ; this geodesic is shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath161 string crosses a @xmath57 brane and four @xmath55 branes and in this process becomes a @xmath167 string ending on the other @xmath59 brane , or equivalently , an @xmath161 departing from it . as explained before in section  3 , only those states are bps which begin and end on two different @xmath59 branes .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the states in fig .  4 ( a ) transform as the antisymmetric representation of @xmath160 . as @xmath168 for the cases of @xmath65 , @xmath70 and @xmath11",

    "the four prongs have the same direction and represent the antisymmetric part of the fourth power of the fundamental as can be seen by composing these configurations with direct @xmath144 strings .",
    "in part ( c ) of figure 4 we illustrate a somewhat surprising presentation of the indirect @xmath145 states , where a single open string prong attaches the @xmath57 brane to a closed string loop by means of a three string junction . the fact that this is an allowed diagram follows , algebraically , from the fact that @xmath41 is left invariant by @xmath169 .",
    "factor arises because by the time the @xmath41 string is about to reach the junction , it has become a @xmath170 string , and the effect of the @xmath57 prong is the same as that of crossing a @xmath57 cut . ] in figure  5 we show a couple of steps that demonstrate that this representation can be related by our moves to fig .",
    "4 ( a ) : as a first step we move the string in fig .  4 ( c ) across the two @xmath59 branes thus creating two prongs .",

    "the upper part of the closed string can be pushed down across the @xmath57 brane , thereby eliminating the @xmath57 prong , and across the @xmath55 branes without creating prongs .",

    "we verify , using the various representatives we have discussed , that the multi - pronged open strings can be combined by the usual rules of joining open strings to give representatives in the class of the expected product .",
    "we will not discuss all possible products we may form , but rather illustrate how the rules work by means of two non - trivial examples . we should also mention that whilst we are able to generate all necessary generators , it is less clear why these are all generators , and why other ( seemingly possible ) diagrams are not relevant . this is presumably a difficult problem whose solution would require a better understanding of the bps condition in this context . on the other hand ,",
    "this problem is not really new : for example in the above description of @xmath54 , the @xmath144 geodesic that winds twice around the @xmath149 singularity does not correspond to a gauge vector , and further `` selection rules '' are necessary .    in the first example",
    "we discuss the product @xmath172 , _ i.e. _ the multiplication of @xmath173 with its conjugate ; this is done in fig .",
    "6 . as a first step we release the strings from the common @xmath55 brane and collapse it partially by crossing a @xmath59 brane and creating a prong .",
    "this gives fig .",

    "the @xmath174 and the @xmath175 of @xmath176 .    in the second example",
    "we discuss the product @xmath177 , _ i.e. _ the product of @xmath178 with itself .",

    "this is a reasonable presentation as an intricate but conventional open string .",
    "its transformation properties under @xmath119 are manifest as the string ends on a @xmath59 brane , and the nature of the presentation is not changed by composition with a direct @xmath145 open string .",
