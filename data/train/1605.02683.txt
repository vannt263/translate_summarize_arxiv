    "recent observations by the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution ( maven ) spacecraft have shown that coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) can have a significant impact on the martian atmosphere , and may have influence mars long - term atmospheric evolution @xcite .",
    "increases in the external ram and magnetic pressure , due to the passage of the cme , compress the martian magnetosphere , which in turn affects the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere .",
    "comparison of maven observations and numerical modeling show that the impact of a cme on 08 march 2015 caused over an order of magnitude increase in the ion escape rate on the dayside , as compared to quiescent times .",
    "evidence from our own solar system suggests that space weather can affect the habitability of a planet through atmospheric losses @xcite . for other stellar systems ,",
    "we expect space weather to be important .",
    "additionally , extrasolar space weather may differ significantly from our own system as exoplanets can orbit at very close distances , and the stellar activity and magnetic field strength can be greatly enhanced . in this work",
    "we combine knowledge of solar space weather with inferred properties of other systems to determine the frequency and severity of cme impacts for two specific cases - a hot jupiter orbiting a solar - type star , and an exoplanet in the habitable zone of a m dwarf .",
    "`` hot jupiters '' were originally one of the most frequently discovered types of exoplanet .",
    "hot jupiters tend to orbit solar - like stars ( f- , g- , and k - type ) at very close distances , typically of order 10 stellar radii ( @xmath1 , 0.046 au ) and as small as 3 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the close orbits lead to a systematic bias in the frequency of observed hot jupiters - these planets are the easiest to observe using radial - velocity or transits .",
    "for example , the transit of the exoplanet hd189733b results in a photometric depth of 3% in the light curve @xcite .",
    "while hot jupiters may account for approximately 20% of discovered exoplanets , @xcite suggest that only 1% of f , g , and k type stars host an hot jupiter .",
    "hot jupiters are not habitable exoplanets due to their close orbits and large size . however , hot jupiters present an opportunity to study planetary systems unlike anything else in our own solar system",
    ". the study of hot jupiters has yielded new insights on the evolution of planetary systems as hot jupiters are thought to form at farther radial distances and migrate in toward the star ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "hot jupiters are expected to have very different planetary weather than seen in the solar system .",
    "the large asymmetry between the dayside and nightside temperatures can lead to extreme atmospheric winds as fast as 3000 m s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the small orbital distances lead to high levels of insolation , which can inflate the radii of hot jupiters and lead to lower planetary densities @xcite .",
    "the high levels of xuv radiation can cause the inflated atmospheres to escape at extreme rates .",
    "for hd189733b , @xcite determine a minimum atmospheric escape rate of 10@xmath3 g s@xmath2 , with observations consistent with values up to several orders of magnitude higher .",
    "more recent measurements by @xcite are consistent with a rate of 10@xmath3 g s@xmath2 .",
    "the hot , inflated atmosphere would be extremely vulnerable to erosion from cme impacts unless shielded by a planetary magnetic field @xcite . for comparison , @xcite estimate that the 08 march 2015 cme impact increased the martian atmospheric escape to 10@xmath4 g s@xmath2 .",
    "the quiescent atmospheric loss of a hot jupiter greatly exceeds values seen in the solar system , and could be significantly enhanced by cme impact .",
    "small , low mass stars , such as m dwarfs , vastly outnumber their more massive counterparts within the galaxy .",
    "m dwarfs great number , combined with their long main sequence lifetime , and small mass and radius , which results in a low luminosity , have made them popular targets in the search for habitable exoplanets .",
    "however , many of the aspects that make m dwarf exoplanets easier to find may also be a detriment to their habitability . the cool , low luminosity nature of m dwarfs leads to close habitable zones , as defined using the traditional requirement of planetary temperatures conducive to the existence of liquid water .",
    "m dwarf habitable zones range between 0.03 astronomical units ( au ) and 0.4 au , with the distance being the smallest for late - type m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the largest of these orbital distances is roughly the same as mercury s orbit . for the early- and mid - type habitable zone exoplanets",
    ", we have no analogue orbit at such small distances within our own solar system .",
    "stellar activity tends to increase with the size of the stellar convection envelope @xcite and stellar rotation rates @xcite , although the activity saturates for sufficiently high rotational velocity @xcite . for mid- to",
    "late - type m dwarfs ( m4 to m8.5 ) the activity saturates at higher rotational velocities than for early - type m dwarfs , and above m9 the activity levels decrease significantly @xcite .",
    "accordingly , most m dwarf stars will have significantly enhanced stellar activity as compared to the sun .",
    "the effects of this enhanced activity should be more pronounced relative to solar exoplanets due to the close proximity of a `` habitable '' m dwarf exoplanet .",
    "m dwarfs have extremely long main sequence lifetimes and can remain active for periods of order gyrs @xcite potentially impinging on exoplanet habitability for long time scales .",
    "one manner in which space weather can adversely affect a potentially habit exoplanet is via the stellar x - ray and euv flux ( xuv ) .",
    "this radiation can heat the upper atmosphere or even ionize it , leading to atmospheric ion pick up loss @xcite .",
    "if the uv radiation can penetrate to the surface then it can damage any potential dna present @xcite .",
    "while the quiescent xuv flux for a m dwarf habitable zone planet is likely an order of magnitude less than that at earth , the flux will increase to 10 - 100 times that at earth during m dwarf flares @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that retaining a moderate atmosphere is critical for habitability and that this can be facilitated by the presence of a strong planetary magnetic field .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that planets orbiting m dwarfs at distances less than 0.2 au may be tidally locked and the slow rotation will affect the planetary dynamo , leading to little to no planetary magnetic field .",
    "@xcite show that in the case of a significant planetary magnetic field , the atmosphere can still be eroded when cme impacts compress the planetary magnetosphere .",
    "as the number of cme impacts increases , an exoplanet becomes less likely to retain an atmosphere to shield the surface from harmful xuv radiation .",
    "this can adversely affect the habitability of an m dwarf exoplanet in the habitable zone , or potentially erode the hot jupiter itself .",
    "these effects will be minimized for planets with an orbital plane corresponding to locations where cmes are less likely to impact .",
    "recent observations of m dwarfs indicate that multi - planetary systems are common , and that the planets tend to share an orbital plane @xcite . for a planet orbiting a star which formed from the same gaseous disk we expect low obliquity ( angle between the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation ) , however , many counterexamples with high obliquity have been observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the orbits of single planets tend to be more oblique than multi - planet systems . in this work",
    "we assume low obliquity , which is representative of many planetary systems , but certainly not all .",
    "after assuming some planetary orbit , to be able to predict the likelihood of cme impact , we need to understand the path a cme takes as it leaves a star .",
    "observations show that solar cmes `` deflect , '' or deviate from a purely radial trajectory .",
    "these deflections correspond to changes in latitude , longitude , or both @xcite .",
    "the deflections tend to move cmes away from coronal holes ( chs ) toward the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs , @xcite ) .",
    "the hcs corresponds to where the solar magnetic field reverses radial polarity , and tends to be located near the solar equator during solar minimum conditions .",
    "magnetic forces deflecting cmes toward the minimum magnetic energy , the hcs on global scales , can explain the direction of observed cme deflections @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adapt a solar cme deflection model , forecasting a cme s altered trajectory ( forecat ; @xcite ) , to predict the deflections of cmes for an m dwarf and hot jupiter system .",
    "considering the full range of plausible cme masses and velocities for both cases , we determine whether cme deflections can increase the likelihood of exoplanetary impacts , which may be detrimental to m dwarf exoplanet habitability or increase the atmospheric erosion of hot jupiters .",
    "@xcite developed forecat , a model for solar cme deflections and rotations based on the background solar magnetic forces ( magnetic tension and magnetic pressure gradients ) .",
    "forecat neglects some time - varying effects such as reconnection .",
    "in contrast to more sophisticated magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models , forecat includes the minimum physics necessary to accurately reproduce observed solar cmes @xcite making large parameter space studies feasible on a standard gpu - enabled desktop computer .",
    "forecat cmes are initiated by specifying the initial position of a cme on the stellar surface ( latitude , longitude , and tilt , measured clockwise with respect to the equatorial plane ) , three shape parameters to describe an elliptical toroidal shape @xcite , as well as the cme mass , @xmath5 , and final propagation velocity , @xmath6 .",
    "forecat includes drag in the nonradial direction to slow the deflection motion .",
    "the standard hydrodynamic drag equation can describe mhd drag @xcite and works best with a drag coefficient set equal to a constant times the hyperbolic tangent of the plasma @xmath7 ( the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure ) .",
    "the drag coefficient constant is taken to be one throughout this work . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that forecat reproduces the observed trajectory of solar cmes and is able to constrain some of the cmes initial parameters and the lower corona background .",
    "forecat depends on empirical and analytic models to describe a cme s radial propagation and expansion .",
    "the cme follows a three - phase propagation model , similar to that presented in @xcite- a slow rise followed by rapid acceleration and finally constant radial propagation .",
    "forecat uses fixed radial distances to transition between the three phases",
    ". the cme slowly rises at 80 km s@xmath2 until 1.5 @xmath8 , followed by linear acceleration until it reaches @xmath6 at 3 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite explore the effect of these chosen values , which are reasonable average values for solar cmes , and find that variations in these parameters can have small effects on the magnitude of the deflection .",
    "the global trends in cme deflection , however , do not change , and we expect that these chosen values should not significantly effect this work . these effects will be explored in a future work .",
    "we expect that the higher surface magnetic field strength of a m dwarf @xcite will provide more energy to accelerate cmes radially .",
    "this could cause an increase in the initial velocity if the cmes have comparable masses to solar cmes , as discussed in section [ dmparams ] . while individual deflections are sensitive to the chosen parameters of the three - phase propagation model @xcite",
    ", we find that the global trends of m dwarf cme deflections do not depend significantly on their specific values .",
    "all forecat cmes expand self - similarly in this work , maintaining a fixed angular width .",
    "observations of solar cmes suggest that their angular width , as viewed in a coronagraph , can rapidly increase close to the sun but remains constant beyond approximately 5 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , self - similar expansion has also been observed much closer to the sun @xcite .    the potential field source surface ( pfss ) model describes the solar background magnetic field using a sum of legendre polynomials weighted by harmonic coefficients determined from a photospheric magnetogram .",
    "this model assumes that the magnetic field can be described as current - free and becomes entirely radial above the `` source surface . ''",
    "the source surface is typically taken to be 2.5 @xmath8 for pfss models of the sun as this produces the most accurate representation of the global structure of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the pfss model has recently been used to describe the magnetic field of a m dwarf @xcite in stellar wind simulations @xcite .",
    "the appropriate source surface distance for an m dwarf is unknown , but @xcite use values of 5 or 4 @xmath1 , respectively . above the source surface",
    ", the solar rotation causes the magnetic field to follow an archimedian spiral @xcite .",
    "the solar wind density is determined by a modified version of the ( @xcite , hereafter g06 ) density model .",
    "the g06 density model combines empirical relations describing the polar or current sheet density versus radial distance .",
    "the radial distance from the current sheet determines the relative contribution of the two density profiles .",
    "finally , we assume the solar wind is purely radial so that the velocity can be determined using the density and a mass flux that does not vary with distance .",
    "similar to the g06 model , we allow the mass flux to vary with angular distance from the current sheet .",
    "we discuss the adaptation of this model to a m dwarf stellar wind in section [ stellarwind ] .",

    "as defined using the incident stellar flux @xcite , should exist around 0.1 au ( 20 @xmath8 , 60@xmath1 ) .",
    "while smaller mass m dwarfs will have even closer habitable zones that may lead to more extreme space weather , we use v374 peg in this work as it has a well - studied surface magnetic map , reconstructed through the use of zeeman doppler imaging @xcite .",
    "this map of the magnetic field has been used to drive several mhd simulations of the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "we use the v374 peg magnetogram and a source surface radius of 5 @xmath12 , the same as used in @xcite and @xcite , to determine the magnetic field with the pfss model . to study the effects on hot jupiters orbiting solar - type stars",

    "we use the alfvn and non - isothermal driven models @xcite , which we refer to as v374 alf and v374 ter in this work . for cr 2029",

    "the mass flux values are the same as those given in @xcite .",
    "as done for previous solar forecat results , we use a higher mass flux in the poles than the current sheet and determine the value at any given location using a weighting based on angular distance from the current sheet .",

    "this yields magnetic pressures of 0.001 dyn @xmath90 and 0.45 dyn @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ fig : planetb](c ) and ( d ) show contours of the minimum planetary magnetic field for the exoplanet cases . for the lower magnetic field cme ( figure [ fig : planetb](c ) ) , we find that the ram pressure dominates for most of the cmes , leading to significant variation across parameter space .",
    "the least massive , slowest cmes require a planetary magnetic field of 1.32 g , and this increases to 15.5 for the most massive , fastest cmes . for the stronger magnetic field cme , the magnetic pressure dominates leading to a larger minimum planetary magnetic field , and less variation with cme parameters . in this case",
    "the minimum planetary magnetic field varies between 26.9 g and 30.9 g.    while these magnetic field strengths may slightly exceed those within our own solar system , they may not be unreasonable for hot jupiters .",
    "@xcite extends a scaling model derived in @xcite , which relates the energy flux available to drive a dynamo with the resulting magnetic field strength .",
    "this model reproduces the magnetic field strength of the earth and jupiter , as well as some low - mass stars , and predicts a magnetic field strength 10 times that of jupiter for a planet 10 times as massive as jupiter .",
    "this suggests that jupiter - like planets could have a magnetic field of order 50 g. recent work by @xcite infers a 28 g planetary magnetic field based on the standoff distance of the planetary bow shock .",
    "this suggests that hot jupiters may have magnetospheres that can shield them from the effects of cme impacts .",
    "while cme deflection will cause a small increase in the frequency of cme impact for a hot jupiter orbiting a solar - type star , and the hot jupiter may need a slightly stronger magnetic field , the system is not terribly different from our own solar system . in comparison ,",
    "cmes from a mid - type m dwarf present an extreme version of solar cmes . for a mid - type m dwarf habitable zone planet to be truly habitable",
    "requires planetary magnetic field strengths orders of magnitude greater than found in our own solar system . in this work , however , we have only considered one m dwarf of spectral type m4 , and at only one point in its main - sequence lifetime .",
    "activity tends to increase from early- to late - type m dwarfs @xcite , until above type m9 when activity decreases @xcite .",
    "late - type m dwarfs tend to have the longest activity lifetimes @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that young , rapidly - rotation , early - type m dwarfs can have kg magnetic fields , and these magnetic field strengths are common among mid- and late - type m dwarfs over a wider range of ages .",
    "we expect cmes to accumulate around the astrospheric current sheet for young early - type m dwarfs and most mid- and late - type m dwarfs . depending on a star s activity lifetime , there may be some time after which the stellar magnetic field and/or activity weakens , constant cme bombardment ceases , and an previously inhabitable exoplanet can start developing an atmosphere .",
    "the activity of m dwarfs tends to correlate with stellar rotation for early - type m dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "develop a model for the spin - down time of a low - mass star due to angular momentum loss via the stellar wind .",
    "we suggest that constant , massive cmes , could also have an effect on the angular momentum loss of a star , which in turn would affect the activity levels .",
    "the analysis in section 7 suggests that as many as 50 cmes per day may occur for an active m dwarf , which agrees with a recent estimation for v374 peg by @xcite .",
    "while this order - of - magnitude estimate is extreme by solar standards , we still expect that less frequent cmes could affect the angular momentum loss .",
    "better understanding will only occur with improved observations of inferred cmes outside our own solar system .",
    "estimating cme s contribution also requires knowledge of the alfvn radius .",
    "we can make an estimate from our simple static backgrounds , but we expect dynamic effects may strongly affect this value . if the cme legs remain attached to the surface of a star , they will begin to wrap around it as the star rotates as much as several times a day . barring any reconnection ,",
    "this could significantly enhance the magnetic field strength close to the star as it crease a large toroidal magnetic field .",
    "this would increase the alfvn radius , allowing for more efficient magnetic breaking of the stellar rotation .",
    "similarly one might wonder the effect of the large numbers of cmes on the stellar mass loss rate . using the m dwarf cme mass distribution used in this work , and assuming 50 cmes a day yields a mass loss rate of 1.5x10@xmath40 m@xmath107 yr@xmath2 .",
    "m dwarfs main sequence lifetimes exceed the solar main - sequence lifetime of 10 billion years , but we find that an m dwarfs mass would change by 0.0015 m@xmath107 yr@xmath2 over a solar lifetime . while this is not a insignificant percentage of the total m dwarf mass , we do not expect mass loss from cmes to cause an m dwarf to slowly change spectral type . however , if the actual mass - loss rate happens to be much higher than our calculated value , it could start to become a concern .",
    "finally , throughout this work we have focused on how cme impacts may adversely affect an exoplanet . in contrast , frequent cme impacts benefit astronomers searching for signatures of aurora on exoplanets .",
    "radio detections of extrasolar could identify previously undiscovered exoplanets , as well as information about exoplanetary magnetospheres .",
    "recently @xcite found signatures of aurora on a planet orbiting an m8.5 dwarf . continued observations with existing , and new facilities such as the owens valley long wavelength array ( ov - lwa ) ,",
    "should find more signatures of planetary magnetospheres .",
    "we suggest the best candidates for extrasolar auroral detections are those where cme impacts occur the most frequently .",
    "exoplanets orbiting m dwarfs should experience the most frequent cme impacts , and we expect these cmes to have a stronger magnetospheric impact than solar cmes .",
    "we have shown that hot jupiters require a significant , yet not implausible , planetary magnetic field , which , combined with their larger size , would lead to aurora brighter than those in our own solar system .",
    "we have adapted forecat , a solar cme deflection model , to simulate cme deflections for the m4 dwarf v374 peg .",
    "m dwarf cme parameters are highly uncertain so we consider cme masses between 10@xmath20 g and 10@xmath23 g and final propagation speeds between 300 km s@xmath2 and 10,000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the deflection depends strongly on the cme mass , and , to a much weaker extent , the cme speed .",
    "the least massive cmes quickly deflect to the astrospheric current sheet and remain trapped there .",
    "these extreme deflections exceed those seen in our own solar system .",
    "we also apply forecat to the deflections of cmes for solar - type stars at hot jupiter distances .",
    "we find the same dependence on mass and speed as seen for the m dwarf but the magnitude of the deflections is significantly smaller . while the cmes continue to deflect toward the astrospheric current sheet , only the slowest , least massive cmes",
    "actually reach it by 10 @xmath8 , analogous to what we see in our own solar system .",
    "we determine the average distance between the cme s deflected position and the astrospheric current sheet as a function of cme mass .",
    "for the mid - type m dwarf cmes we find that the distance does not depend on the initial position for cme masses below 10@xmath21 g. for the solar - like cmes the distance does depend on the initial position so we determine the amount of deflection toward the astrospheric current sheet as a function of cme mass .",
    "we combine these relations between the deflection and the cme mass with geometrical arguments and an estimation of the m dwarf cme mass distribution to determine the probability and frequency of cme impacts .    for both habitable zone mid - type m dwarf exoplanets and hot jupiters",
    "the probability of impact decreases if the exoplanet s orbit is inclined with respect to the astrospheric current sheet .",
    "the sensitivity to the inclination is much greater for the mid - type m dwarf exoplanets due to the extreme deflections to the astrospheric current sheet . for low inclinations",
    "we find a probability of 10% whereas the probability decreases to 1% for high inclinations . from our estimation of 50 cmes per day",
    ", we expect habitable mid - type m dwarf exoplanets to be impacted 0.5 to 5 times per day , 2 to 20 times the average at earth during solar maximum .",
    "the frequency of cme impacts may have significant implications for exoplanet habitability if the impacts compress the planetary magnetosphere leading to atmospheric erosion .",
    "for the hot jupiters , the impact probability has a similar range but more inclinations have moderate values , near a few percent , as opposed to a clear division between the two extremes as seen for the mid - type m dwarf .",
    "we quantify the effect of these cmes on an exoplanetary magnetosphere by determining the minimum planetary magnetic field need to maintain a magnetosphere twice the size of the planetary body .",
    "this size corresponds to the minimum necessary to retain an atmosphere according to @xcite .",
    "we find the mid - type m dwarfs exoplanets require planetary magnetic fields between tens to hundreds of gauss , whereas hot jupiters only require magnitudes between a few and 30 g. the magnetic field needs to shield a planet from cme impacts greatly exceeds that required for shielding from the stellar wind .",
    "we expect that rocky exoplanets can not generate sufficient magnetic field to shield their atmosphere from mid - type m dwarf cmes , but hot jupiters around solar - type stars could likely remain shielded .",
    "we expect that the minimum magnetic field strength will change with m dwarf spectral type as the amount of stellar activity and stellar magnetic field strength change , and that early - type m dwarfs would be more likely to retain an atmosphere than mid or late - type m dwarfs ."
