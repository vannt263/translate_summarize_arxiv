    ", we use spreading sequences as codes to communicate each other in the same band of the frequency .",
    "this is a big feature of cdma systems .",
    "we can efficiently use the frequency band with cdma .",
    "+ recently , the number of people who communicate each other has been dramatically increasing .",
    "however , the band of frequency we can use is limited . the new method to communicate which has high capacity @xcite",
    "is required .",
    "+ in this paper , our topic is about designing direct spreading sequence based cdma ( ds - cdma ) @xcite . in general , high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) has been demanded for achieving high spectral efficiency @xcite . in cdma , crosscorrelation is a key component of interference noise .",
    "it is necessary to reduce crosscorrelation to achieve high capacity .",
    "autocorrelation is related to code synchronization at receiver side .",
    "it is desirable that the first peak of crosscorrelation and the second peak in autocorrelation should be kept low .",
    "however , there are some limitations about the correlation nature of spreading sequences .",
    "sarwate @xcite shows the relationship that there is an avoidable trade - off between lowering crosscorrelation peak and autocorrelation s second peak .",
    "this result shows that we can not have the peak of crosscorrelation and autocorrelation zero .",
    "welch @xcite shows that the lower bounds on the maximal crosscorrelation and autocorrelation is bounded below .",
    "+ the current spreading sequence of 3 g cdma systems is the gold code @xcite .",
    "it is known that this spreading sequence as well as kasami sequence is optimal in all the binary spreading sequences . in @xcite @xcite ,",
    "the use of chaotic spreading sequences is proposed .",
    "so far , many spreading sequences have been proposed which are obtained from chaotic maps .",
    "examples of such spreading sequences are : based on the logistic map @xcite , based on the chebyshev map @xcite , based on ergodic theory @xcite and the bernoulli shift @xcite @xcite .",
    "+ on the contrary to those previous works , we derive spreading sequences whose snr is maximized in a very general setting where we do not assume an explicit mechanism of generating sequence such as maps for chaotic spreading sequence as that in the above works .",
    "+ the expression of the snr formula is firstly obtained in @xcite @xcite . to increase snr , we have to reduce the denominator of snr , namely , variance of interference noise .",
    "however , in their expressions , it is difficult to differentiate snr in terms of the parameter variables of spreading sequences . here ,",
    "we show the new snr formula whose denominator is differentiable in terms of the parameter variables of spreaing sequences . from this expression",
    ", we construct the optimization problem : minimize the denominator of snr . if there are two users in the channel , we obtain the highest snr to solve the problem .",
    "we numerically obtain such solutions dramatically improving snr which is much greater than existing standard gold sequences with slsqp @xcite and evaluate these solutions with the sarwate s limit .",
