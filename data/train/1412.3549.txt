    "a number of seminal results have been obtained from studies of periodically driven quantum systems @xcite .",
    "one important example , of many decades old and relevant to various research areas ( such as cavity quantum electrodynamics ) , is the coherent rabi oscillations induced by a driving field @xcite .",
    "a recent example is the possibility of generating intriguing topological phases by periodic driving @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative periodic driving is now widely known to be useful in altering symmetry , stability , and topology of a system .",
    "the flexibility in applying a driving field also makes periodically driven systems an attractive platform to realize quantum control and quantum simulation .",
    "considerable theoretical activities have been devoted to time - independent non - hermitian systems @xcite that are relevant to optics and to quantum systems with both gain and loss . in particular ,",
    "time - independent non - hermitian systems with certain symmetries may still possess a real spectrum before reaching symmetry - breaking points .",
    "experiments on many time - independent non - hermitian systems were performed @xcite .",
    "motivated by these progresses , here we explore periodically driven systems with non - hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "given the vast literature about driven hermitian systems , driven non - hermitian systems are anticipated to be rich and enlightening as well .",
    "the dynamics of a periodically driven system is dictated by its floquet spectrum .",
    "if the floquet spectrum of a driven non - hermitian system still falls on the unit circle , the floquet operator will be unitary up to a similarity transformation .",
    "then , upon an arbitrary number of driving periods , a floquet eigenstate only acquires pure phase factors and a general initial state evolves via coherent phase oscillations . in this manner , periodic driving helps to stabilize the dynamics . as shown below via a non - hermitian rabi model ,",
    "this is feasible ( even when the hamiltonians have complex spectrum during the driving ) , not just for isolated points in the parameter space , but for a _ continuous _ range of system parameters . a previously unknown type of rabi oscillations , termed `` generalized rabi oscillations , '' is also found .",
    "our computational findings are explained through a mapping between a rather general form of driven non - hermitian two - level systems and the band structure of a class of lattice hamiltonians .",
    "depending on the explicit form of the driving , the mapped lattice hamiltonian can be hermitian or non - hermitian .",
    "on the one hand , the stability of a driven non - hermitian problem is connected with a conventional quantum mechanics problem , thus laying a solid foundation for driven non - hermitian systems . on the other hand",
    ", we now have a nonconventional means to simulate lattice hamiltonians , via a driven two - level system only . recognizing the fundamental importance of hofstadter s butterfly spectrum ( hbs ) in condensed - matter physics @xcite",
    ", we show how to simulate , in a straightforward manner , the hbs - like spectrum of a class of superlattice hamiltonians as well as its interesting extensions . compared with hbs",
    "realized in 2-dimensional solid - state materials @xcite , 2-dimensional ultracold gases in optical lattices @xcite , and hbs considered in 1-dimensional lattice systems @xcite , the simulation strategy proposed here is simpler because it is _",
    "0-dimensional _ in space .",
    "let a non - hermitian but time - periodic dimensionless hamiltonian be @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the driving period .",
    "throughout we assume scaled and hence dimensionless units ( with @xmath2 ) .",
    "the initial time is @xmath3 . unlike previous treatment for time - dependent non - hermitian systems @xcite",
    ", here we stick to the normal schrdinger equation and the conventional dirac inner product structure .",
    "the time propagator for the period of @xmath4 $ ] is defined as @xmath5 and it satisfies @xmath6 with the initial condition @xmath7 . note that the dynamics yielded by eq .",
    "( [ ueq ] ) with a time - dependent and non - hermitian @xmath8 is nonunitary in general @xcite .",
    "the floquet operator associated with @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , with its spectrum determined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath10 where the @xmath11th floquet eigenstate is @xmath12 with the eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "of particular interest is the situation when all @xmath14 are indeed real and hence @xmath13 are pure phase factors .",
    "if this is true , then @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a diagonal unitary matrix with phase factors @xmath13 on the diagonal and @xmath17 is a similarity transformation . a floquet operator satisfying eq .",
    "( [ generalu ] ) is said to possess `` extended unitarity , '' which then yields @xmath18 .",
    "thus , if extended unitarity emerges , then only pure phase factors @xmath19 enter into the time evolution operator for ( arbitrary ) @xmath20 driving periods .",
    "the dynamics is hence stable because there is no exponential growth or decay with @xmath20 .    to make a driven non - hermitian system as simple as possible",
    ", one may introduce non - hermitian terms to a two - level rabi model , which is much relevant to understanding the evolution of two optical polarizations in a nontransparent medium @xcite .",
    "we discuss two specific examples , characterized by two real parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 . in the first example",
    ", we choose @xmath24\\sigma_x,$ ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "the driving component of @xmath27 is anti - hermitian , with two driving frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( this is to indicate a rather arbitrary periodic driving ) .",
    "the findings are summarized in fig .",
    "1(a ) , obtained by carefully scanning the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 and then checking the floquet spectrum .",
    "there the shaded regimes represent the domains of extended unitarity .",
    "one might navely think that extended unitarity only occurs accidently .",
    "contrary to this intuition , it is seen to emerge for a wide and continuous range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with highly intricate domain boundaries .",
    "it should also be stressed that domain of extended unitarity is _ not at all _ the domain for @xmath27 to have a real instantaneous spectrum .",
    "@xmath30{2x2a.png } & \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{2x2b.png } \\end{array}$ ]    let us turn to the second example with the hamiltonian @xmath31\\sigma_x$ ] .",
    "the static component of @xmath32 now has a component parallel to the non - hermitian driving term .",
    "extended unitarity also emerges , with the corresponding phase diagram in fig .",
    "1(b ) displaying again subtle boundaries . note that the instantaneous eigenvalues of @xmath33 are not real except @xmath34 .",
    "that is , stabilization is possible , even when the instantaneous spectrum of @xmath33 is complex during almost the entire period of driving . in principle , one is allowed to introduce and then scan over more system parameters other than @xmath35 or scan @xmath35 in the complex domain .",
    "however , it would be challenging to present a high - dimensional phase diagram .",
    "qualitatively similar stabilization is also observed in many other non - hermitian variants of the rabi model , including those with a hermitian driving but non - hermitian static component .",
    "@xmath36{u1.png } & \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{u2.png}\\\\ \\quad~~\\text{(c)}&\\quad~~\\text{(d)}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{rabi1.png } & \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{rabi2.png } \\end{array}$ ]    next we take two sets of @xmath35 from the domain of extended unitarity of @xmath37 to further digest the dynamics .",
    "firstly , we analyze in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2rabi ] the real part of the spectrum of @xmath5 for @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "because @xmath37 is traceless , it can be shown that if and only the two eigenvalues of @xmath5 have the same real parts , then the eigenvalues of @xmath5 can be written as @xmath39 with a real @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the top two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2rabi ] depict the splitting of one common real part of the eigenvalues into two , followed by a recombination of two into one .",
    "such splitting and recombination behavior may occur several times within one period .",
    "this vividly shows that , at times not equal to multiple periods of @xmath1 , @xmath5 does not necessarily have real eigenphases .",
    "thus , yielding extended unitarity ( at @xmath41 ) still allows for rather complicated and potentially exotic dynamics within one driving period .",
    "secondly , let us examine the population dynamics in the presence of extended unitarity .",
    "the initial state is assumed to be the first state and the corresponding results are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2rabi ] .",
    "stable and coherent population oscillations are observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2rabi](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:2x2rabi](d ) , representing a type of generalized rabi oscillations .",
    "interestingly , the total population on the two states may go beyond unity , which reminds us that the system dynamics is stable but not unitary .",
    "a careful check further shows that in the two shown examples the population difference ( rather than the population sum ) is unity at all times .",
    "this is because the driving field happens to be perpendicular to the static field , whose direction is also the direction of population measurement .",
    "to gain insights into why stability can be thus restored , we now consider a class of traceless and non - hermitian two - level hamiltonians subject to one - parameter periodic modulation : @xmath42\\cdot{\\bm \\sigma},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is time - independent and @xmath44 is a complex periodic variable , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are an arbitrary but fixed set of vectors forming a right - handed basis set . for reasons to be elaborated below",
    ", @xmath47 is assumed to be real .",
    "we next expand @xmath5 in the same representation , yielding @xmath48 with complex expansion coefficients @xmath49 under the initial conditions @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the two eigenvalues of @xmath9 are hence given by @xmath53 .",
    "clearly then , for @xmath40 to be a real phase ( hence extended unitarity ) , it is sufficient and necessary for @xmath54 to be real , with @xmath55 , such that @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "because the eigenvalues of @xmath57 are simply @xmath58 , this condition also leads to @xmath59 and hence @xmath60 for arbitrary @xmath20 .    to proceed we substitute eq .",

    "( [ u0u1eq ] ) onto a space variable @xmath66 and introducing @xmath67 , we turn eq .",

    "for example , if @xmath72 is a time - periodic square function , then @xmath73 will become a generalized dirac - kronig - penney model as it is comprised by @xmath74 potentials with alternating signs .",
    "interestingly , because @xmath75 and @xmath76 naturally form a super - symmetric potential pair , they yield identical spectrum @xcite . as such , nontrivial solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) with a common eigenvalue @xmath47 should exist for both @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this being the case , one may just focus only on @xmath77 and @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) . due to this mapping ,",
    "below we do not clearly distinguish between @xmath65 and @xmath66 variables when the context is clear .",
    "the extended unitarity condition @xmath60 can now be better digested . intuitively ,",
    "if there is a complex eigenphase @xmath40 , then the condition @xmath60 is violated because of an exponential growth of @xmath79 vs @xmath20 .",
    "but if this exponential growth occurs , then @xmath80 diverges with @xmath20 and hence can not be a bloch eigenfunction at energy @xmath47 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) ] . that is to say , in order to achieve dynamics stabilization , the system parameters must be chosen such that the driving field profile @xmath72 admits bloch wavefunctions at energy eigenvalue @xmath47 [ via eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) ] . on the other hand , if @xmath81 is a bloch wavefunction , then one can indeed explicitly construct from @xmath81 a solution of @xmath62 satisfying @xmath60 and its initial condition .",
    "we have thus identified a mapping between the band structure of @xmath73 and the stability in a driven non - hermitian system .",
    "more detailed analysis shows that through this general mapping , the real eigenphase @xmath40 of @xmath9 becomes the bloch quasi - momentum times the lattice period in the band structure problem for @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82{band1.png } & \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\columnwidth]{band2d.png } \\end{array}$ ]    returning to the case of @xmath27 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 $ ] . then the mapped lattice potential becomes @xmath87 + 2\\pi\\mu [ \\cos(2\\pi x)-2\\sin(4\\pi x)]$ ] , a real superlattice potential . in the same manner",
    ", @xmath33 is mapped to a lattice potential @xmath88 + 2\\pi \\mu \\cos(2\\pi x)$ ] .",
    "@xmath89 is seen to be complex , but it is invariant upon a joint time - reversal and parity ( @xmath90 ) operation , the so - called @xmath90 invariance .",
    "the possibility of having real spectrum ( @xmath47 is constructed to be real ) under @xmath90 symmetry ensures that we still possibly have bloch wavefunctions for @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , for both examples of @xmath27 and @xmath33 , the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "1 can now be understood as the collection of all possible real band energy eigenvalues @xmath91 as a function of a second system parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the origin of the boundaries seen in fig .",
    "1 is hence identified as the presence of energy gaps for the real potential @xmath92 , or as an interplay of band gaps and symmetry - breaking points for the @xmath90-symmetric complex potential @xmath89 . to further check our understandings , for one value of @xmath22 we record @xmath40",
    "when extended unitarity occurs and then plot @xmath93 vs @xmath40 for @xmath37 and @xmath32 ( red squares ) .",
    "the results are then compared in fig .  3 with band dispersion relations obtained from direct band - structure calculations for @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "the agreement seen in fig .",
    "3 confirms our exact mapping described above .",
    "to motivate potential experimental interest , let us now investigate two non - hermitian rabi models upon introducing a parameter @xmath96 that describes the period ratio of two commensurable driving periods .",

    "if the parameter @xmath96 is a rational number with @xmath98 ( @xmath99 two co - prime integers ) , the mapped superlattice potential @xmath100 , comprised by a base lattice of period unity and additional superlattice components , still has a period @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath96 parameter hence resembles the role of the magnetic flux per plaque in the hbs hamiltonian of the original quantum hall problem @xcite . for a fixed value of @xmath22",

    ", many clear gaps and intriguing domain boundary profiles are found .",
    "this is achieved without the use of a magnetic field , a clean 2-dimensional material , or even a 1-dimensional lattice potential .",
    "given the paradigmatic role of hbs in understanding quantum hall physics @xcite , our findings in fig .",
    "[ fig : butterfly](a ) have paved a nonconventional way towards the simulation of quantum hall physics , including topological phase transitions . for example , it will be valuable to examine the topological characterizations and implications of the gaps seen in fig .",

    "this situation hence represents a complex extension of the original hbs problem .",
    "interestingly , the resulting phase diagram of @xmath104 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : butterfly](b ) has much less gaps and is thus quite different from a conventional hbs . upon a careful inspection",
    ", the lack of many gaps here is found to be connected with @xmath90-symmetry breaking in the mapped problem .",
    "that is , a gap often closes at the critical quasi - momentum value for which the spectrum of a @xmath90-symmetric lattice becomes complex [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion - relation](b ) ] .",
    "stabilization by periodic driving does not need the instantaneous spectrum of the hamiltonian to be real .",
    "this further extends opportunities in studies of non - hermitian systems .",
    "stabilization can be also achieved in other non - hermitian systems with more levels .",
    "extended unitarity realized by periodic driving is expected to be more useful than what is learned here .",
    "we also note a recent stimulating study @xcite , where the emphasis is placed on how @xmath90-symmetry of driven systems is broken by a close - to - resonance perturbation .",
