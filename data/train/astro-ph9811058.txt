    "a growing body of evidence ( as outlined , for instance , by @xcite ) indicates that elliptical galaxies typically harbor a central massive dark object ( or mdo ) .",
    "the masses of mdos in elliptical galaxies are best determined for giant ellipticals with nuclear gas disks , such as m87 ( @xcite ) , ngc 4261 ( @xcite ) , and m84 ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar dynamics can also yield estimates for mdo masses , although the estimated masses are model - dependent .",
    "for example , magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) looked at a sample of nearby galaxies with _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ photometry and ground - based kinematics .",
    "of the 32 elliptical galaxies in their sample , they found that 28 were well fitted by an axisymmetric model with a two - integral distribution function , a constant mass - to - light ratio , and an optional mdo .",
    "of the galaxies consistent with their model , 26 required the presence of an mdo for the best fit , with a typical mdo mass of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "in addition to housing central mdos , most elliptical galaxies have central cusps in the luminosity density @xmath8 . for a sample of early - type galaxies observed by",
    "_ hst _ ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the logarithmic slope of the luminosity density , @xmath9 , is significantly different from zero for most galaxies at @xmath10 from the galaxy center .",
    "elliptical galaxies fall into two distinct classes , distinguished by their central density profile ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; `` core '' galaxies have shallow cusps , with @xmath11 , and `` power law '' galaxies have steeper cusps , with @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .    the presence of a central mdo or density cusp has a significant effect on the structure of an elliptical galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it determines whether or not a galaxy can be highly triaxial .",
    "( the phrase `` highly triaxial '' can be quantified .",
    "consider an ellipsoid with principal axes of length @xmath13 .",
    "the triaxiality is customarily given by the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "an ellipsoid with @xmath15 is nearly oblate , an ellipsoid with @xmath16 is nearly prolate , and an ellipsoid with @xmath17 is highly triaxial . ) in a stellar system with a constant density core , such as the `` perfect ellipsoid '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) , stars can follow box orbits , on which stars eventually come arbitrarily close to the center , or tube orbits , on which stars circulate about the long or short axis of the system .",
    "box orbits are generally referred to as the `` backbone '' of a triaxial galaxy ; since tube orbits can only be used to construct a nearly axisymmetric system , the presence of box orbits is required for a highly triaxial system . however , in a galaxy with a central point mass or a steep density cusp , box orbits are broken up ; a star on a box orbit will eventually have a close encounter with the central mass , subjecting the star to a large - angle deflection .",
    "modeling galaxies with density cusps , @xmath18 , places restrictions on their permitted equilibrium shapes .",
    "schwarzschild ( 1993 ) examined self - similar triaxial models with @xmath19 ; he discovered that self - consistent models were not possible for extremely flattened galaxies ( @xmath20 ) . in his highly flattened triaxial models",
    ", schwarzschild found that many of the orbits were stochastic , changing shape significantly over @xmath21 orbital times .",
    "merritt & fridman ( 1996 ) found that for weak cusps , with @xmath22 , as well as for strong cusps , with @xmath19 , a large fraction of model orbits are stochastic .",
    "the mixing time in phase space for the stochastic orbits is roughly 100 times the orbital period for a model with a steep cusp , but may be more than 1000 times the orbital period for a model with a weak cusp .",
    "since stochastic orbits in a triaxial potential are nearly axisymmetric and nearly spherical , it is impossible to create an equilibrium self - consistent model for a strongly triaxial galaxy with a central density cusp . for a jaffe model , which has @xmath23 in the central regions , merritt ( 1997 )",
    "found self - consistent solutions only for models which were both nearly axisymmetric ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) and nearly spherical ( @xmath26 ) . looking at models with different values of @xmath27 ,",
    "fridman & merritt ( 1997 ) found that cuspy models with @xmath28 can only have stable boxlike orbits if they are nearly spherical ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "studies of scale - free , cuspy disks , with @xmath30 , place severe restrictions on the shapes of highly flattened galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; generally speaking , a cuspy galaxy in equilibrium can not be both highly flattened and highly triaxial .",
    "central point masses are even more effective than central density cusps at inducing chaotic mixing of orbits .",
    "a relatively modest central black hole , with @xmath31 , is as effective as a steep @xmath19 cusp at inducing chaotic mixing of orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( @xcite ) indicate that a black hole of this mass will change the galaxy s overall shape on a time scale @xmath32 times the orbital period at the half - mass radius",
    ".    observed elliptical galaxies have a range of cuspiness , as expressed by the logarithmic slope @xmath27 of the luminosity density , and a range of mdo masses , as expressed by the ratio @xmath33 of the mdo mass to the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , cuspiness and mdo mass appear to be inversely linked . in the sample of early - type galaxies modeled by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the 21 core galaxies have a median @xmath34 , and the 11 power law galaxies have a median @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , three of the power law galaxies , but none of the core galaxies , are best fit by a model with @xmath36 . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test reveals that the distributions of @xmath37 for the two populations differ at the level @xmath38 .",
    "core ellipticals and power law ellipticals are known to differ in many properties other than the slopes of their density cusps .",
    "in addition to having steeper cusps and lower mass mdos , power law ellipticals tend to have relatively low luminosity ( @xmath39 ) , disky isophotes , and rapid rotation .",
    "core ellipticals have relatively high luminosity ( @xmath40 ) , boxy or elliptical isophotes , and slow rotation .",
    "the two classes also seem to differ systematically in their apparent axis ratios ; tremblay & merritt ( 1996 ) showed that bright elliptical galaxies ( which tend to be core galaxies ) are rounder on average than fainter ellipticals .",
    "the shapes of the fainter ellipticals are consistent with their being randomly oriented oblate spheroids , but the bright ellipticals can not all be oblate .",
    "tremblay & merritt ( 1996 ) looked at the average shape of elliptical galaxies , represented by the luminosity - weighted axis ratio ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to looking at the average shape , it is also interesting to examine how the apparent shape of a galaxy s isophotes changes with radius .",
    "for instance , consider an elliptical galaxy which is initially highly triaxial .",
    "( this is not an absurd assumption ; the merger of two disk galaxies , for example , is capable of producing a highly triaxial remnant [ @xcite ] . )",
    "the central cusp and mdo of the elliptical galaxy will make it more nearly axisymmetric and more nearly spherical , starting from the inner regions , where the dynamical time is shortest , and working steadily outward . if the characteristic time for changing the shape is @xmath41 , then at a given galaxy age @xmath42 , the inner region where @xmath43 will be nearly axisymmetric and nearly spherical , while the outer regions will still retain their initial shape .",
    "is this naive picture true ?",
    "are real elliptical galaxies more nearly axisymmetric and spherical in their inner regions than in their outer regions ?",
    "does the variation of shape with radius differ for core galaxies and for power law galaxies ? to investigate these questions ,",
    "i examine the apparent shapes , as a function of isophotal radius , for a sample of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the details of the galaxy sample used are given in section 2 below . in section 3 ,",
    "i compare the shapes of the core galaxies and of the power law galaxies in the sample . for each galaxy ,",
    "i compute the axis ratio of the isophote where the dynamical time is @xmath44 0.75 myr , and that of the isophote is @xmath44 50 myr . comparing the inner isophotes , where the dynamical time is short , i find that the core galaxies are significantly rounder than the power law galaxies . at the outer isophotes ,",
    "the core galaxies and power law galaxies have the same distribution of apparent shapes . in section 4 ,",
    "i summarize the results and their implications .",
    "the sample consists of 44 elliptical galaxies drawn from the study of faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter f97 ) , who compiled early - type galaxies that had been imaged by the _ hst _ planetary camera through filter f555w ( approximately the @xmath45 band ) .",
    "my sample of 44 ellipticals excludes ngc 7768 , but includes every other galaxy in the f97 compilation which is classified as an e galaxy in the _ second reference catalog of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "ngc 7768 was excluded from the sample because its central dust disk strongly affects the surface brightness at @xmath45 within about @xmath46 of the galaxy s center ( grillmair et al .",
    "1994 ) .    although ngc 7768 was the only galaxy discarded from the sample due to the presence of dust , many of the remaining ellipticals contain detectable amounts of dust in their central regions ( @xcite ) , usually within a kiloparsec or so of the galaxy s center .",
    "thus , the effect of dust on isophote shapes is a potential concern when determining the shapes of the central regions of ellipticals .",

    "the l95 sample , and hence the f97 compilation , is weighted toward galaxies with high central surface brightness .",

    "given the somewhat eclectic nature of the f97 sample , it is prudent to check that the shapes of the f97 ellipticals are representative of elliptical galaxies as a whole , and are not biased toward nearly round or highly flattened shapes . to find an overall average shape for each elliptical ,",

    "the solid line gives the distribution of @xmath115 , and the dotted line gives the distribution of @xmath128 .",
    "a glance at figure 3 shows that @xmath115 for the core galaxies has a significantly different distribution from the other three populations .",
    "this visual impression is confirmed by a kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to the different distributions . the results of the ks test are displayed in table 3 .",
    "the only pairs of distributions which differ at the 99% confidence level , as measured by the ks test , are @xmath115 for core galaxies and @xmath128 for core galaxies , with @xmath134 , and @xmath115 for core galaxies and @xmath115 for power law galaxies , with @xmath135 .    within the subsample of core ellipticals ,",
    "@xmath115 is uncorrelated with the absolute magnitude @xmath136 of the galaxy ; a similar lack of correlation between @xmath115 and @xmath136 is seen within the subsample of power law ellipticals .",
    "this indicates that the difference in @xmath115 between core and power law ellipticals is not simply a luminosity - dependent effect , reflecting the greater average luminosity of core galaxies , but rather is more fundamentally linked to the physical difference between core and power law galaxies .",
    "( this result also suggests that the finding of tremblay & merritt [ 1996 ]  that bright ellipticals ( @xmath137 ) are rounder than faint ellipticals  is based on the fact that core ellipticals are rounder than power law ellipticals in their inner regions . the luminosity - weighted mean axis ratio used by tremblay & merritt",
    "is strongly weighted to the bright inner regions of the galaxies , where the core ellipticals , which dominate the @xmath137 sample , are rounder than power law ellipticals . )    instead of looking at the cumulative distribution function , @xmath138 , for a sample of @xmath139 axis ratios , i can compute a nonparametric kernel estimate of the distribution function @xmath112 , defined so that @xmath140 is the fraction of all galaxies with axis ratios in the range @xmath141 .",
    "a full discussion of using nonparametric estimates for @xmath112 is given by tremblay & merritt ( 1995 ) and ryden ( 1996 ) ; i will give only a brief outline here .",
    "given a sample @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 of apparent axis ratios , the kernel estimate of @xmath112 is @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the kernel function . to produce a smooth differentiable estimate ,",
    "i used a gaussian function , @xmath148 of width @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the standard deviation of the sample .",
    "this kernel width , for distributions that are not strongly skewed , minimizes the integrated mean square error ( @xcite ) .",
    "because @xmath102 is limited to the range @xmath151 , i use reflective boundary conditions at @xmath152 and @xmath153 to ensure the proper normalization for @xmath154 . because these boundary conditions are artificially imposed",
    ", the prudent reader will not place much confidence in the shape of @xmath155 within a distance @xmath156 of the boundaries at @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "error intervals can be placed on the estimated @xmath159 by a process of bootstrap resampling ( @xcite ) . from the original data set @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , i draw , with replacement , a new set of @xmath139 data points and compute a new estimate of @xmath159 . after making 1000 bootstrap estimates ,",
    "i use them to place error intervals on the original estimate @xmath159 .",
    "for instance , the 80% confidence interval at a given value of @xmath102 is the range in @xmath159 such that 10% of the bootstrap estimates lie above the interval and 10% of the bootstrap estimates lie below the interval .",
    "the upper panel of figure 4 shows the distribution of apparent shapes for the inner isophotes of core galaxies , where @xmath114 .",
    "the solid line is the best estimate for @xmath160 ; the dashed lines give the 80% error interval and the dotted lines give the 98% error interval .",
    "the peak in @xmath159 is at @xmath161 ( a nearly round shape , equivalent to an e1 galaxy ) .",
    "the corresponding distribution for the shapes of the outer isophotes of core galaxies is given in the upper panel of figure 5 ; note that the peak in @xmath159 for the outer regions is at @xmath162 .",
    "the distribution of apparent shapes for the inner regions of power law galaxies is shown in the upper panel of figure 6 .",
    "the corresponding distribution of shapes for the outer regions of power law galaxies is shown in the upper panel of figure 7 .",
    "note that the distribution @xmath159 peaks at @xmath163 for power law galaxies , in both their inner and outer regions .",
    "so far , i have dealt only with the apparent projected shapes of galaxies , and not with their intrinsic three - dimensional shapes . for an individual galaxy ,",
    "it is impossible to determine the intrinsic shape merely from a knowledge of the projected photometry .",
    "however , if i assume that the galaxies in a sample are all randomly oriented oblate spheroids , i can perform a mathematical inversion of @xmath164 to find the underlying distribution @xmath165 of intrinsic shapes , where @xmath166 is the intrinsic axis ratio of the oblate spheroid , with @xmath167 . similarly , if i assume that the galaxies are randomly oriented _ prolate _ spheroids , i can perform an inversion to find @xmath168 , the underlying distribution of axis ratios for the prolate galaxies .    the game of finding the distribution of intrinsic shapes of elliptical galaxies , using the oblate and prolate hypotheses , has been played for several decades ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the use of kernel estimates and bootstrap resampling permits us to reject or accept the oblate hypothesis ( or the prolate hypothesis ) at a given level of statistical confidence .",
    "for instance , i can take a given sample of axis ratios , and invert the best estimate @xmath159 and the estimate for each of the 1000 bootstrap resamplings , using the hypothesis that the galaxies are randomly oriented oblate spheroids .",
    "this gives me a best estimate for @xmath165 as well as 1000 bootstrap estimates . at each value of @xmath169",
    ", an upper limit can be placed on @xmath170 at the 90% confidence level , for example , by finding the value of @xmath170 such that 10% of the bootstrap estimates fall above this value .",
    "if this upper confidence level falls below zero , then the oblate hypothesis can be rejected at the 90% ( one - sided ) confidence level , since negative values of @xmath170 are unphysical .",
    "similar analysis of @xmath171 can be used to reject or accept the prolate hypothesis .    for the inner regions of core galaxies , where @xmath172 , the nonparametric estimate @xmath170 , given the oblate hypothesis ,",
    "is shown in the middle panel of figure 4 .",
    "the best fit ( shown as the solid line ) dips below zero for @xmath169 close to one , but given the width of the error intervals , the oblate hypothesis can not be rejected at the 90% confidence level . the best fitting @xmath170 peaks at @xmath4 , with a hint of a secondary peak at @xmath173 .",
    "the prolate hypothesis , illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 4 , is statistically acceptable for the inner region of core galaxies ; @xmath171 peaks at @xmath174 .    for the outer regions of core galaxies , where @xmath175 , the best estimate for @xmath170 is shown in the middle panel of figure 5 . the best fit , shown as the solid line , dips below zero for @xmath176 , and the upper bound of the 98% confidence interval is below zero for @xmath177 .",
    "thus , the oblate hypothesis can be rejected at the 99% one - sided confidence level .",
    "the prolate hypothesis , as indicated by the bottom panel of figure 5 , can also be rejected at the 99% confidence level .",
    "thus , at least some amount of triaxiality must be present to explain the observed lack of nearly circular isophotes .",
    "once the hypothesis of axisymmetry is abandoned , it requires two axis ratios , @xmath178 and @xmath166 , to describe the shape of a triaxial galaxy . for a population of triaxial systems ,",
    "the distribution of intrinsic axis ratios , @xmath179 , is no longer uniquely determined by the distribution of observed axis ratios , @xmath112 .",
    "however , i can determine a permissible distribution of intrinsic axis ratios by assuming a parametric form for @xmath180 and adjusting the parameters to yield the best fit .",
    "for instance , assume that the outer regions of the core galaxies in my sample have intrinsic axis ratios distributed according to the law @xmath181 \\ .\\ ] ] ( there is no particular physical reason to expect @xmath180 to be an isotropic gaussian in @xmath182 space ; this is merely a convenient parameterization . )",
    "the best - fitting set of parameters , as measured by a ks test to the observed axis ratios of the outer regions of core galaxies , is @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , with a ks probability of @xmath186 .",
    "although the peak of this distribution is at a nearly prolate shape , it is also possible to get a good fit with a model in which the most probable shape is oblate ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , yielding @xmath190 ) .    for the inner regions of power law galaxies , where @xmath2 , the nonparametric estimate for @xmath170 is shown in the middle panel of figure 6 .",
    "although the best fit to @xmath170 , given by the solid line , drops below zero for @xmath191 , the oblate hypothesis , given the width of the error intervals , ca nt be ruled out at the 91% confidence level .",
    "the best fit to @xmath170 peaks at @xmath192 ; if the inner regions of power law galaxies are randomly oriented oblate objects , then very few of them can be rounder than @xmath193 .",
    "the prolate hypothesis , as shown in the bottom panel of figure 6 , is statistically acceptable ; it also leads to the conclusion that few power law galaxies have inner regions rounder than @xmath193 .",
    "since the outer and inner regions of power law galaxies have a similar distribution of apparent shapes , the nonparametric estimate of @xmath170 for the outer regions of power law ellipticals , shown as the middle panel of figure 7 , is similar to that for the inner regions , shown as the middle panel of figure 6 . for the outer regions , the best fit peaks at @xmath194 , with few galaxies , under the oblate hypothesis , being rounder than @xmath193 .",
    "the prolate hypothesis , illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 7 , is also statistically acceptable for power law galaxies .",
    "the distributions of @xmath128 for the core galaxies and the power law galaxies in my sample are statistically indistinguishable ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "thus , it is illuminating to adopt the hypothesis that the shapes of elliptical galaxies in the regime for @xmath196 is independent of whether their central density cusps are steep or shallow . with this hypothesis ,",
    "the samples of @xmath128 for core galaxies and power law galaxies can be combined , to provide better statistics .",
    "the combined sample has 34 galaxies ( 20 core , 14 power law ) . for the combined sample , @xmath197 peaks at @xmath198 .",
    "the lack of nearly circular galaxies in the combined sample , along with the narrower error intervals , means that both the oblate hypothesis and the prolate hypothesis can be rejected at the 99% confidence level .",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath128 for the combined sample of core and power law galaxies can be well fit by a population of triaxial shapes . the best - fitting parametric function @xmath199 of the form given in equation ( 6 ) has parameters @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , yielding @xmath203 .",
    "however , acceptable fits are also provided by models in which the most probable shape is oblate ( @xmath187 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , yielding @xmath206 ) and by models in which the most probable shape is prolate ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 , yielding @xmath209 ) .",
    "in their outer regions , where @xmath108 , the core ellipticals in the f97 sample have a distribution of apparent shapes which is indistinguishable from that of the power law ellipticals .",
    "the scarcity of elliptical galaxies with circular isophotes in their outer regions implies that they are probably not all oblate or prolate objects . due to the degeneracy of the problem ,",
    "it can not be determined , from the surface photometry alone , whether the majority of elliptical galaxies are nearly oblate , nearly prolate , or highly triaxial in their outer regions .",
    "( moreover , even if core ellipticals and power law ellipticals have an identical distribution of apparent shapes in projection , this does not demand , although it does permit , an identical distribution of intrinsic shapes . )",
    "the most intriguing result of my analysis is that in the region where @xmath210 , the core ellipticals are significantly rounder than the power law ellipticals . in this regime ,",
    "the oblate hypothesis is acceptable for core ellipticals , with a distribution of intrinsic axis ratios peaking at a fairly round shape , @xmath211 . in the very central regions , @xmath212 , the core ellipticals become flatter again on average , probably due , in part , to the presence of circumnuclear stellar disks seen in projection .",
    "how can we explain the observation that core galaxies are so nearly spherical in the region where @xmath210 ?",
    "this region is far enough from the center that circumnuclear disks of stars , gas , and dust do nt strongly affect the isophote shape , but has orbital times short enough for a central mdo to have completed chaotic mixing .",
    "the observed shapes of core galaxies are consistent with their being nearly spherical and nearly oblate in their inner regions , and more flattened and more triaxial in their outer regions , just as we would naively expect from the effects of a central mdo .",
    "the shape transition occurs at dynamical times of @xmath213 , or orbital times of @xmath214 .",
    "the observation that power law galaxies have the same distribution of apparent shapes in their inner and outer regions seems to indicate that the central density cusp and mdo in power law galaxies is not effective at driving the stellar orbits in the central region to more spherical stochastic shapes .",
    "the observed difference in shape between core ellipticals and power law ellipticals may be linked to a difference in their origins .",
    "faber et al .  ( 1997 ) have proposed a scenario in which cores with shallow cusps are the result of the orbital decay of mdos accreted during galaxy mergers .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of binary black holes in the centers of galaxies ( @xcite ) has shown that the galaxy s stellar distribution develops a central core as stars are ejected from the central cusp by the black hole binary .",
    "the mass of the stellar core which develops is roughly 5 times the mass of the black hole binary . for the core ellipticals",
