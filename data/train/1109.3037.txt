    "in paper @xcite we identified a group of intermediate - duration grbs ( here figure  [ fig:1 - 2 ] , left panel ) , significant at @xmath0 level , by the maximum likelihood ( ml ) ratio test and bivariate fitting of log - normal functions on the hardness ratio - duration plane . here",
    "we focus on the other properties of these bursts and employ the same sample , i.e. , the data obtained from the rhessi satellite between february 14 , 2002 and april 25 , 2008 .",
    "the number of the grbs belonging to the group of , by the highest probability , short , intermediate , and long bursts is 40 , 24 , 363 , respectively .",
    "we evaluated spectral lags , similarly to @xcite , by fitting of the peak of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of the background - subtracted count light - curves at two channels @xmath1kev and @xmath2kev ( see an example in figure  [ fig:1 - 2 ] , right panel )",
    ". then we applied kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and student t - test to find whether the group of intermediate - duration grbs is more similar to the group of short or long bursts . in some cases",
    "the evaluation of the lag was impossible , because of the high noise level of the ccf .",
    "therefore the sample of the lags is smaller than the overall number of the rhessi bursts .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig:3 - 4 ] and summarized in table  [ tab:1 - 2 ] .",
    "next we focused on the count peak rates .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 - 6 ] presents the peak count rates vs. @xmath3 durations and the cumulative distributions of the all three identified groups .",
    "the k - s and t - test probabilities were calculated and results are presented in table  [ tab:3 - 4 ] .",
    "the k - s test applied on the spectral lag distributions of the short- and intermediate - duration bursts gives the k - s probability 20.7% and k - s distance 0.33 .",
    "the tabular critical value of the k - s distance at the significance level @xmath4% and the given number of the elements ( 24 and 15 ) is 0.45 .",
    "therefore the null hypothesis that the lags of the short and intermediate bursts are drawn from the same distribution can not be rejected at the 5% significance level .",
    "on the other hand , the same test applied on the lags of the intermediate vs. long ( and short vs. long ) bursts gives the k - s probability 1.47% ( 0.01% ) and the k - s distance 0.42 ( 0.49 ) .",
    "the tabular critical value of the k - s distance at the 5% significance level for the number of the intermediate and long bursts ( 15 and 98 ) is 0.38 .",
    "therefore the hypothesis that the lags of the intermediate and long bursts are drawn from the same distribution can be rejected at this 5% significance level .          from the results of the k - s test applied on the peak count rates it follows that the distributions of the peak count rates are different over all three groups .",
    "the t - test is not persuasive for both cases ; spectral lags and peak count rates .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] displays the sky distribution of all localized bursts in our sample .",
    "unfortunately there are only two well localized intermediate events , therefore any statistical analysis is meaningless .",
    "concerning supernova observations ( sn ) , we found that all grbs with underlying or possible underlying sn have , by rhessi , long duration and there is no sn observation for any rhessi intermediate - duration burst .",
    "this finding is similar to the fact that , in general , there is no sn - grb connection for short - duration bursts associated with the model of the merger of two compact astrophysical objects .",
    "we also tried to find the star formation rates of the host galaxies in the published articles ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the intermediate bursts and compare them with the hosts of the short and long bursts .",
    "however , we were unsuccessful in finding the measurements of the star formation rates for the rhessi intermediate - duration bursts .    for the redshift measurements of the bursts observed by rhessi ,",
    "the average value for the short busts is @xmath7 and for the long ones @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately no redshift measurements are available for the intermediate bursts .",
    "this study was supported by the grant agency of the czech republic , grants no .",
