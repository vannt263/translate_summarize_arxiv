    "as indicated in the discussion above , the signs for photon hopping are dictated by the product of mode functions involved in the hopping ; specifically @xmath49 this result shows that , up to irrelevant sign changes induced by gauge transformations , photon hopping is strictly positive for full - wavelength modes .",
    "by contrast , for half - wavelength modes , alternating signs of the mode functions can indeed lead to observable changes .",

    "experimentally , transmission and reflection measurements are by far the simplest probes for circuit qed arrays , and are performed routinely in small circuit qed systems with one or two resonators @xcite .",
    "conceptually , such measurements are implemented by coupling one resonator ( or several ) to an external transmission line , through which microwave photons can be injected , and subsequently detected in heterodyne or homodyne . for theory , however , the analysis of even this simple setting is challenging for larger numbers of resonators and qubits , since it generally involves both strong correlations , and the complexity of non - equilibrium physics for a driven , damped quantum system .    assuming that the coupling to the external transmission lines ( and any additional baths ) is weak , the system may be described by a lindblad master equation of the form @xmath50 + \\kappa\\sum_j\\mathcal{d}[{\\hat{a}}_j ] { \\hat{\\varrho } } +   \\gamma\\sum_j\\mathcal{d}[{{\\hat{\\sigma}}}^-_j ] { \\hat{\\varrho } } + \\frac{\\gamma_\\varphi}{2}\\sum_j\\mathcal{d}[{\\hat{\\sigma}}^z_j ] { \\hat{\\varrho}}.\\ ] ] here , the last three terms involve the damping superoperator @xmath51{\\hat{\\varrho}}={\\hat{l}}{\\hat{\\varrho } } { \\hat{l}}^\\dag-\\{{\\hat{l}}^\\dag { \\hat{l}},{\\hat{\\varrho}}\\}/2 $ ] @xcite and account for photon loss , qubit relaxation and pure dephasing of qubits . for simplicity",
    ", we will neglect pure dephasing ( @xmath52 ) and assume decoherence with uniform rates induced by coupling to separate baths .",
    "extensions to shared baths and varying decoherence rates are possible , but can add further complexity to the analysis .",
    "the unitary evolution is captured by the liouville term , and expressed in terms of the system hamiltonian in the frame co - rotating with the drive , i.e.   @xmath53 here , the unitary is @xmath54 and removes the time - dependence of the drive hamiltonian @xmath55 for a single drive frequency @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the hamiltonian including the drive .",
    "under steady - state conditions , @xmath58 , the master equation ( [ master ] ) forms a linear system of equations for the matrix elements of @xmath59 .",
    "its solution , in principle , enables the prediction of transmission and reflection signals by calculating @xmath60 , whose real and imaginary part correspond to the two quadratures of the homodyne signal in transmission .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that the brute - force numerical solution of this equation represents a formidable challenge even for arrays with only a handful of resonators and qubits : the number of independent real variables to be determined from @xmath58 is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the number of resonators and qubits in the lattice , and @xmath64 is the cutoff in photon number . as an example : a lattice consisting of 3 resonators and 3 qubits leads to a linear system of equations with @xmath65 variables when admitting up to 4 photons in each resonator .",
    "a more appropriate cutoff scheme , not based on a truncation of the photon hilbert space , will be described in section 5 .    in light of this scaling , it is useful to note that the direct calculation of the full reduced steady - state density matrix can be avoided , and instead , only those elements of @xmath59 be evaluated that indeed contribute to the expectation value @xmath66 . to see this ,",

    "we review the simple and exact solution in linear response first , and discuss numerical results beyond this in section 5 .    interaction in circuit qed lattices is readily understood as a hard - core repulsion between bosonic excitations on qubit sites , which is so strong that levels beyond the ground and first excited state are pushed to inaccessibly high energies .",
    "formally , the jaynes - cummings lattice thus corresponds to a two - species bose - hubbard model with @xmath69 on resonator sites and @xmath70 on 2-level sites @xcite .",
    "this interaction , of course , is only effective in the presence of multiple  particles \" ( i.e.  polariton excitations ) .",
    "hence , it may be ignored in the linear response regime where weak driving does not lead to multiple excitations . in this limit , all qubit sites can be replaced by a second set of harmonic oscillator sites , @xmath71 , and the resulting lattice hamiltonian , @xmath72 describes a simple system of coupled oscillators .    using @xmath73 to denote the detuning of the drive from frequency @xmath74 , the commutator required for the calculation of @xmath75 , eq .",

    ", the drive interferes with the reflected wave from the cavity , i.e. @xmath183 in the absence of coupling between resonator and qubits ( @xmath165 ) or if qubit dissipation is negligible ( @xmath184 ) , we have @xmath185 expressing the conservation of the photon flux @xmath186 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath165 , where qubits and resonators are decoupled .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows the transmission @xmath187 as a function of detuning between resonator and drive frequency @xmath166 .",
    "as expected , peaks in transmission correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the resonator array .",
    "for @xmath145 the quasi - momentum states @xmath188 are degenerate leading to only two peaks at @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "for @xmath191 the spectrum is in general non - degenerate and the three peaks mark the three quasi - momentum modes of the ring lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , the dependence of transmission on drive detuning @xmath166 and phase twist @xmath126 shows that the transmission follows the resonator dispersion @xmath192 , cf .",
    "[ fig4](c ) . an interesting detail : when the spectrum is almost degenerate transmission is very sensitive to changes in the phase twist , see , e.g. , the situation of @xmath193 close to @xmath122 . for these parameters",

    "@xcite ) .    for @xmath144 and small drive ,",
    "linear response theory remains valid and qubit sites can be replaced by harmonic oscillators as discussed in section 3 .",
    "results from this treatment are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) where the transmission @xmath187 is plotted as a function of detuning @xmath166 ( @xmath194 and fixed @xmath145 ) . for @xmath195 , the qubits are not in resonance with any of the eigenmodes of the resonator array .",
    "relative to the non - interacting case @xmath99 , the coupling to the qubits slightly shifts the frequency of the resonator peaks and three additional peaks ( two of them degenerate at @xmath145 ) appear in the spectrum close to @xmath196 . by contrast , for @xmath170 the qubits are in resonance with the @xmath197 resonator mode and , analogous to the vacuum rabi splitting in the single - site jaynes - cummings model , the resonance peak splits . in fig .  [ fig4](e ) we show the transmission @xmath187 as a function of the detuning @xmath171 between qubit and resonator and drive detuning @xmath166 .",
    "as the qubit frequency @xmath113 is varied , qubits are tuned in and out of resonance with each of the resonator modes . for comparison ,",
    "[ fig4](f ) depicts the spectrum of the system in the 1-excitation manifold as a function of qubit detuning @xmath171 .    for stronger",

    "we compute the relevant expectation values via the steady - state solution of the full quantum master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , even small resonator arrays and moderate photon number cutoffs lead to matrix sizes for the superoperator which quickly become impractical .",
    "this problem can be mitigated slightly by an adaptive truncation scheme for the density matrix elements .",
    "first , note that the hamiltonian @xmath198 conserves the number of excitations @xmath134 , while the drive hamiltonian @xmath199 induces transitions between subspaces of different excitation numbers .",
    "each element of the standard fock basis @xmath200 is associated with an excitation number @xmath134 .",
    "now , assigning to each element of the density matrix @xmath201 a generalized excitation number @xmath202 defined as the sum of the excitation numbers of the states @xmath200 and @xmath203 , a truncation based on @xmath202 is possible where the cutoff is adjusted with increasing drive strength @xmath176 .",

    "[ fig5](b ) , the peak additionally becomes asymmetric , shifts to smaller detunings and finally at strong drive splits into two . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we have marked the 1-photon transition energies and half of the 2-photon transition energies , revealing that the second peak appears at half the 2-photon transition frequency .",

    "[ fig5](c ) where the probabilities for zero , one and two excitations are plotted .",
    "at the frequency of the 1-photon transition increasingly strong driving leads to a larger population of the 1-excitation sector @xmath214 but the probability for two excitations @xmath215 remains small . at half the 2-photon transition frequency",
    "the population of the 1-excitation space @xmath214 remains small , but at stronger drive strength the 2-excitation manifold is occupied .",
    "this behavior resembles the nonlinear vacuum rabi splitting as observed in a single - site jaynes - cummings system @xcite .",
    "since the spectrum is nonlinear , photon blockade @xcite prevents population transfer from the 1-excitation to the 2-excitation subspace due to the energy mismatch of @xmath219 vs.  @xmath220 , see inset of fig.[fig5](a ) .",
    "specifically , driving the system on the 1-photon transition @xmath217 transfers population from the ground state @xmath221 to the first excited state @xmath222 , but a second excitation with the same energy can not enter the system . on the other hand , driving the system at half the 2-photon transition frequency @xmath216 , not very effective at low power , allows for two - photon transitions at sufficiently large power .",
    "the features of the transmission signal can thus be explained naturally as a consequence of the nonlinear spectrum of the system .",
    "in summary , we have explored the physics of a jaynes - cummings ring , the minimal circuit qed system manifesting effects of broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "analogous to bosons in rotating ring lattices , degeneracies at specific values of the gauge field and interactions lead to strongly - correlated states . as future experiments are likely to employ transmission as one probe for such systems",

    "it is clear that a theoretical description of transmission experiments with larger lattices and/or higher drive power will require novel simulation techniques beyond the explicit calculation of the steady - state density matrix of the master equation .",
    "analytical and numerical methods from the field of quantum transport may turn out to be adaptable to this novel setting .",
