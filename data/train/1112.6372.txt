    "the study of shock waves in collisionless plasmas @xcite has received , both from the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite point of view , a great deal of attention in the last few decades .",
    "this widespread interest is justified by the central role that such structures play in many significant astrophysical scenarios such as cosmic rays generation @xcite during supernova explosions @xcite , strong fields generation in the bow - shock region @xcite and nonlinear dynamics of the solar wind @xcite , just to cite a few .",
    "collisionless shock waves are routinely detected also in laser - plasma experiments which have therefore been proposed as smaller scale test - beds to systematically study astrophysical scenarios in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the increasing level of detail offered by both laboratory measurements and space observations suggest the need for continuous refining of the underlying theory .",
    "most of the theoretical studies reported in the literature exploit the korteweg - de vries / burgers ( kdvb hereafter ) equation which elegantly combines an interplay among nonlinearity , dispersion and dissipation effects in the generation and evolution of shock structures .",
    "however , the outstanding variety of plasma scenarios in which shocks may occur has made it difficult to develop a unified theoretical description of these intrinsically nonlinear excitations .",
    "a major theoretical challenge in plasma modeling arises from the fact that most ( e.g. , astrophysical ) plasmas may present significant deviation from a maxwellian behavior , mostly due to the presence of accelerated electron populations @xcite .",
    "non - maxwellian plasma particle distribution also occurs in the lab @xcite , e.g. , during high - intensity laser - matter interactions , where the generated plasma clearly fails to thermalize within the short observation time interval , a fact reportedly affecting the measurable characteristics of nonlinear structures propagating in the plasma @xcite . fundamentally speaking ,",
    "such energetic particles populate the superthermal region of the velocity distribution , and thus result in a long - tailed distribution function .",
    "a power - law behavior thus arises , at high velocities , a fact which motivated vasyliunas @xcite to introduce a phenomenological long - tailed distribution , termed the kappa ( @xmath0 ) distribution ( after the real valued @xmath0 spectral parameter involved in it ) , which succeeds in reproducing the observed power - law dependence at high energies @xcite , while remaining close to the maxwellian curve at low ( subthermal ) velocities . in the years that followed",
    ", the kappa distribution has been proven remarkably successful in fitting space observations ( see , e.g. , the various references in refs . ) and , more recently , laboratory measurements @xcite . understandably , kappa theory has inspired a number of theoretical studies @xcite , with the ambition of elucidating the effect of superthermal populations on the plasma dynamics .    despite its success on the space - observational test - bench , vasyliunas apparently ubiquitous distribution function remained in the grey area of phenomenology , lacking a rigorous foundation from first principle . in the meantime",
    ", alternative forms of the original kappa function have appeared @xcite , citing all of which clearly goes beyond our scope here .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the interesting review and extensive discussion presented in ref . .",
    "a challenging non - maxwellian - boltzmannean paradigm appears to come from a different perspective , in tsallis non - extensive statistical - mechanical framework @xcite , a recently proposed generalization of boltzmann statistics , which seems to incorporate a parametrized family of non - maxwellian functions which correspond stationary equilibria which in fact maximize a generalized entropy , in analogy with the boltzmann function and gibbs entropy ( smoothly recovered from the tsallis theory at some limit ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the tsallis theoretical club has started to attract its own members within the plasma physics community @xcite . as a natural consequence",
    ", the relation between kappa and tsallis theories was investigated in space plasmas @xcite and , in fact , it was recently argued @xcite on a rigorous basis that the very foundation of the kappa distribution lies in the tsallis theory .",
    "although this remains an open topic in the community , it would appear that the ubiquity of kappa distributions implies its deep foundations in nature , which are still to be traced .",
    "our target in this article is to investigate , from first principle , the effect of excess superthermality on a fundamental problem in plasma physics , namely the propagation of electrostatic shocks evolving on the ionic scale . adopting the @xmath0-theoretical framework in its original form @xcite and relying on the analytical toolbox presented in ref .",
    "( details of which are to be omitted ) , we shall develop a comprehensive formalism for one - dimensional ion - acoustic shock waves propagating in unmagnetized electron - ion plasma .",
    "dissipation effects will be included by assuming non - negligible ion viscosity .",
    "the electron nonthermality is modeled by adopting a @xmath0-distribution for the electrons .",
    "a nonlinear evolution equation for the electric potential will be derived , by using a multiscale ( variable stretching ) iterative scheme .",
    "the competing nonlinear and dispersive term(s ) will be shown to be significantly dependent upon the @xmath0 parameter which therefore significantly modifies the shock amplitude and width ( compared to the maxwellian case ) .",
    "analytical and numerical techniques will be employed to solve the associated kdvb equation ( discussion above ) , and particular attention will be paid to the stability profile and the geometric characteristics of the shock excitations .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows .",
    "the building blocks of the analytical model are presented in the following section [ model ] and its dispersion properties are analyzed , in section [ lanalysis ] . a multiscale perturbation technique",
    "is then employed in section [ k - dvb ] , leading to the working horse of the study , a korteweg - de vries / burgers partial - differential equation ( pde ) for the electrostatic potential .",
    "the shock - profile solutions of the k - dvb equation are presented and their dynamics is investigated in section [ solution ] .",
    "our results are finally summarized in the concluding section [ conc ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider an unmagnetized electron - ion plasma where the electrons are assumed to be described by a @xmath1distribution function .",
    "the ions are assumed as a cold ( @xmath2 ) viscous population whereas the electrons will be considered as a fast neutralizing background .",
    "the electron inertia can in fact be neglected if we consider that ion - acoustic electrostatic waves move at phase velocity ( @xmath3 ) which is much higher than the ion thermal speed and yet in turn much lower than the electron thermal speed : @xmath4 . in a one - dimensional fluid description , the dynamics of the ions",
    "is governed by the following ( normalized , dimensionless ) set of fluid equations : @xmath5 here @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the ion density ( normalized to the equilibrium ion density ) , the ion fluid velocity ( normalized to the ion sound speed @xmath10 ) , the electrostatic potential ( normalized by @xmath11 ) and the ion kinematic viscosity , respectively .",
    "time and length are normalized in terms of the inverse of the ion plasma frequency ( @xmath12^{-1/2}$ ] ) and the plasma screening length ( @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] ) respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath14 was assumed to ascertain neutrality at equilibrium ( the index ` 0 ' denotes the equilibrium quantities ) . given this normalization , the ion viscosity @xmath15 is scaled into a ( dimensionless ) expression as @xmath16 . as usual",

    "( [ ia4 ] ) makes the differential equation ( [ ia3 ] ) of intractable analytically . in order to overcome this difficulty , we assume that any disturbance of the electric potential is small ( i.e. @xmath29 ) . in this regime ,",
    "a taylor expansion of eq ( [ ia4 ] ) around this parameter can be performed , allowing to express the electron density as @xmath30 .",

    "( [ dr2 ] ) carries two fundamental consequences .",
    "the first is that @xmath40 is real for all @xmath41 , implying that no damped mode is present .",
    "this is due to the fact that a weak value of the damping coefficient was assumed , by scaling the ion viscosity as @xmath42 ( cf . the next section ) , hence the latter does not appear in the dispersion relation .",
    "furthermore , the plasma screening length of a @xmath0-distributed plasma is a function of @xmath0 : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 represents the screening length of a maxwellian distributed plasma with same temperature and density ( see fig . [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "the non - thermality of the plasma has thus the effect of _ reducing _ the plasma screening length : the maxwellian value is in fact retrieved in the limit case @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noticing here that the dispersion relation obtained here coincides with eq .",

    "this implies that the sound speed ( and subsequently the phase speed of an ion - acoustic wave ) is reduced in the presence of superthermal electrons .",
    "we proceed now to derive a @xmath0-dependent evolution equation for propagating localized ( constant profile ) disturbances of the plasma dynamic variables , by adopting a multiscale perturbation technique .",
