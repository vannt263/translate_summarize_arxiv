    "nowadays , highly charged ions are not only the object of scientific investigation in atomic and plasma physics , laboratory astrophysics etc . , but also the technological tool in the fields of accelerator techniques , ion microscopy , surface machining on the nanoscale , ion therapy and elsewhere .",
    "the specific charge state of ions is crucial in a number of applications . in the case of the successive multiple ionization of ions by electron impact ,",
    "the charge states @xmath7 are determined by the ionization factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron beam current density and @xmath10 is the duration of ion bombardment by incident electrons ( ionization time ) .",
    "the latter is bounded above by the time of transition of plasma into a steady state .",
    "it is easy to estimate that the production of ions in high - charge states necessitates the dense electron beam and significant ionization time .",
    "accordingly , there is inevitable necessity to employ a trap for confinement of ions .",
    "a trap formed by the axially symmetric smooth electron beam , which propagates through the cylindrical drift tube consisting of a few ( at least three ) sections with positive potentials applied to the edge sections , was suggested by e.d .",
    "donets in 1967 @xcite .",
    "the method was realized in a device , which was named the electron beam ion source ( ebis ) .",
    "the ions are confined by volume charge of the electron beam and by external potentials at both ends of the drift tube .",
    "the depth of ion trap is given by difference of the maximum and minimum potentials : @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the axially symmetric magnetic field is also applied to compress the electron beam and hinder the radial escape of ions from the potential well .",

    "]    the original ion sources were developed for injection complexes of accelerators @xcite .",
    "the devices were intended to provide the high - intensity ion beams .",
    "this required creation of the electron - optical systems with electron beam of about 1  m in length and characterized by current of a few ampers @xcite . for the ion sources employed in real accelerators",
    ", the electron current density falls in the range of 100500  a/@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such values of @xmath9 are not sufficient for the production of highly charged ions of heavy elements of the periodic table . in 1986 , the electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) was constructed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) for the purposes of x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "physically , the ebit is similar to the ebis operating in the trapping regime .",
    "however , the distinguishing feature of such device is the small length of ion trap of about 2 cm , what allowed one to increase significantly the current density @xmath9 up to 5  ka/@xmath2 and to ionize heavy elements up to uranium @xcite .",
    "the classical livermore ebit with the electron beam energy @xmath12 of up to 30 kev is now widely replicated around the globe .",
    "the devices similar to the high - energy superebit aiming at the production of highly charged heavy ions were also constructed in germany , japan and china @xcite .",
    "all the devices mentioned above employ the cryogenic engineering and superconducting magnetic focusing systems .",
    "these apparatuses remain to be very complicated and expensive to use and , accordingly , are available to large laboratories and national reseach centers only .    in 1999 , a warm ebit with electron beam focused by the radially magnetized permanent magnets was successfully tested in dresden .",
    "a whole family of ion sources and traps named the dresden ebis / ts was developed on the basis of this technology together with standard methods of obtaining the ultra - high vacuum @xcite . at present , the devices operate at different universities and research centers .",
    "the important feature of the dresden ebis / ts is a room working temperature , which significantly decreases the exploitation costs .",

    "the electron current density is the key for the production of highly charged ions . in ebis / ts ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath9 for given values of the focusing magnetic field @xmath13 at cathode and the energy of electron beam is limited by requirements of the brillouin focusing . in reality , the true density is even lower because of the influence of thermal velocities @xcite . a substantial increase in current density",
    "can be achieved in the local ion trap formed by a rippled electron beam in a cylindrical drift tube @xcite . in this case , the electron beam is focused by a thick magnetic lens in a sharp crossover , where @xmath9 can reach values of up to 100 ka/@xmath2 .",
    "this principle is realized in the main magnetic focus ion source ( mamfis ) ( see fig .",

    "the extraction of ions from the source is realized by changing the shape of electron beam .",
    "the rippled electron beam is transformed into a smooth flow with constant radius , when changing potential of the focusing electrode .",
    "although the ion trap is just about 1 mm in length , it is compensated by extremely high values of @xmath9 and small sizes of the device .",
    "presently , prototypes of the mamfis with @xmath12 of up to 4 , 10 and 30 kev are constructed ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "the field of applications of ebits is rather extensive .",
    "however , one can distinguish two areas of research , which require complementary energy ranges of the electron beam and , accordingly , different designs .",
    "the first area of research covers the low - charge ions produced in low - energy electron beams . in particular",
    ", one can mention here the spectroscopic data relevant to the sources of the extreme ultraviolet radiation ( ions of sn and xe with the charge @xmath23 ) and diagnostics of high - temperature plasmas related to the solar corona ( ions of fe with @xmath24 ) and to fusion plasmas in the iter reactor ( ions of tungsten with @xmath25 ) . in 2012 , a compact ebit with the energy of electron beam from 100 ev up to 2.5 kev was developed for these purposes at the university of electro - communications in tokyo @xcite .",
    "similar devices were also built at the fudan university and the national institute of standards and technology @xcite .    from the other side , there is still a long - standing problem of complete ionization of heavy elements . in literature",
    ", it is known only one work , where about ten fully stripped u@xmath26 ions were produced and trapped @xcite . despite long - term research on the superebits in tokyo , heidelberg and shanghai",
    ", no one could reproduce the results obtained at llnl . since the binding energy of the @xmath27-shell electrons in uranium is about 130 kev , the electron beam for such experiments should have very high energy not less than 200250 kev .",
    "for ionization of all electron shells except for the @xmath27 shell of any heavy element up to uranium , the energy of electron beam should be at least 60 kev .",
    "it is natural to separate a problem of ionization of the @xmath27-shell electrons in heavy elements into a particular challenge .",
    "the energy regimes of electron beam within the range from 100  ev up to 60  kev can be realized in a single universal device , which combines technologies of the ebis / t and mamfis .",

    "a steady charge - state distribution of ions is characterized by equality of the ionization and competing processes .",
    "the latter involves mainly charge exchange and radiative recombination .",
    "since the rate of charge exchange depends on number density of the working gas , the corresponding contribution can be suppressed at the expense of ultra - high vacuum in the ion trap .",
    "the radiative recombination occurs predominantly into the innermost electron shells , but its cross section @xmath44 decreases with increasing the electron energy ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the k - shell ionization cross section @xmath45 is calculated for u@xmath46 ions , taking into account the relativistic corrections @xcite . as can be seen , the cross sections @xmath44 and @xmath45 become comparable at @xmath47  kev , that is , at about 7 threshold units .",
