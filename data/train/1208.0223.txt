    "the brain is a natural networked system @xcite .",
    "the understanding of this complex system is one of the most fascinating scientific tasks today , concretely how this set of millions of neurons can _ symbiotically _ interact among them to give rise to the collective phenomenon of human thinking @xcite , or , in a simpler and more realistic approach , what neural features can make possible , for example , the birdsongs @xcite .",
    "different aspects of neurocomputation take contact on this problem : how brain stores information and how brain processes it to take decisions or to create new information",
    ". other universal properties of this system are more evident",
    ". one of them is the existence of a regular daily behavior : the sleep - wake cycle @xcite .     [",
    "2states ]    the internal circadian rhythm is closely synchronized with the cycle of sun light ( fig . [ 2states ] ) . roughly speaking and depending on the particular species ,",
    "the brain is awake during the day and it is slept during the night , or vice versa . all mammals and birds sleep .",
    "there is not a well established law relating the size of the animal with the daily time it spends sleeping , but , in general , large animals tend to sleep less than small animals ( fig .",
    "2 ) . hence , at first sight , the emergent bistable sleep - wake behavior seems not depend on the precise architecture of the brain nor on its size .",
    "this structural property would mean that , if we represent the brain as a complex assembly of units @xcite , the possible bistability , where large groups of neurons can show some kind of synchronization , should not depend on the topology ( structure ) nor on the number of nodes ( size ) of the network ( fig . [ waksleep ] ) .",
    "[ table1 ]        then , it is essential the type of local dynamics and the excitation / inhibition coupling among the nodes that must be implemented in order to get bistability as a possible dynamical state in a complex network .",
    "so , on one side , it has been recently argued @xcite that the distribution of functional connections @xmath2 in the human brain , where @xmath2 represents the probability of finding an element with @xmath3 connections to other elements of the network , follows the same distribution of a scale - free network @xcite , that is a power law behavior , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 around @xmath6 .",
    "this finding means that there are regions in the brain that participate in a large number of tasks while most of the regions are only involved in a tiny fraction of the brain s activities . on the other side ,",
    "it has been shown by kuhn et al .",
    "@xcite the nonlinear processing of synaptic inputs in cortical neurons .",
    "they studied the response of a model neuron with a simultaneous increase of excitation and inhibition .",
    "they found that the firing rate of the model neuron first increases , reaches a maximum , and then decreases at higher input rates .",
    "functionally , this means that the firing rate , commonly assumed to be the carrier of information in the brain , is a non - monotonic function of balanced input .",
    "these findings do not depend on details of the model and , hence , they are relevant to cells of other cortical areas as well .",
    "putting together all these facts , we arrive to the central question that we want to bring to the reader : is it possible to reproduce the bistability in a complex network independently of the topology and of the number of nodes ? .",
    "the answer is yes ( fig .",
    "[ yes ] ) .",
    "what kind of local dynamics and coupling among nodes must be implemented in order to get this behavior ? . in section",
    "[ sec - few ] , we give different possible strategies for the coupling and the local dynamics which should be implemented in a few coupled functional units in order to get a bistable behavior .",
    "then , in section [ sec - many ] , the same model is exported on a many units network where the desired bistability is also retained . in view of the results ,",
    "the possibility of constructivism in the world of complex systems in general , and in the neural networks in particular , is suggested in the conclusion .",
    "our approach considers the so called _ functional unit _ ,",
    "i.e. a neuron or group of neurons ( voxels ) , as a discrete nonlinear oscillator with two possible states : active ( meaning one type of activity ) or not ( meaning other type of activity ) .",
    "hence , in this naive vision of the brain as a networked system , if @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , represents a measurement of the @xmath9 functional unit activity at time @xmath10 , it can be reasonable to take the most elemental local nonlinearity , for instance , a logistic evolution @xcite , which presents a quadratic term , as a first toy - model for the local neuronal activity : @xmath11        it presents only one stable state for each @xmath12 .",
    "then , there is no bistability in the basic component of our models . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the dynamics dissipates to zero , @xmath14 , then it can represent the functional unit with no activity . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the dynamics is non null and it would represent an active functional unit .",
    "we can suppose that this local parameter @xmath12 is controlled by the signals of neighbor units , simulating in some way the effect of the synapses among neurons .",
    "excitatory and inhibitory synaptic couplings have been shown to be determinant on the synchronization of neuronal firing .",
    "for instance , facilitatory connections are important to explain the neural mechanisms that make possible the object representation by synchronization in the visual cortex @xcite . while it seems clear that excitatory ( _ symbiotic _ ) coupling can lead to synchronization , frequently inhibition rather than excitation synchronizes firing @xcite . the importance of these two kinds of coupling mechanisms has also been studied for other types of neurons , v.g .",
    ", motor neurons @xcite .",
    "if a neuron unit simultaneously processes a plurality of binary input signals , we can think that this local information processing is reflected by the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the functional dependence of this local coupling on the neighbor states is essential in order to get a good brain - like behavior ( i.e. , as far as the bistability of the sleep - wake cycle is concerned ) of the network . as a first approach",
    ", we can take @xmath12 as a linear function depending on the actual mean value , @xmath16 , of the neighboring signal activity and expanding the interval @xmath17 in the form : @xmath18 with @xmath19 @xmath20 is the number of neighbors of the @xmath9 functional unit , and @xmath21 , which gives us an idea of the interaction of the functional unit with its first - neighbor functional units , is the control parameter .",
    "this parameter runs in the range @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , the dynamical behavior of these networks with the excitation type coupling @xcite presents an attractive global null configuration that has been identified as the _ turned off _ state of the network .",
    "also they show a completely synchronized non - null stable configuration that represents the _ turned on _ state of the network . moreover , a robust bistability between these two perfect synchronized states is found in that particular model . for different models with a few coupled functional units we sketch in the next subsections the regions where they present a bistable behavior .",
    "the details of the complete unfolding @xcite of these dynamical systems can be found in the references @xcite .",
    "let us start with the simplest case of two interconnected @xmath26 functional units .",
    "three different combinations of couplings are possible : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .        as we are concerned with interactions with a certain degree of symbiosis between the coupled units , the regions of parameter space where bistability is found for the first two cases are presented here .",
    "experimental systems where similar couplings have been found or implemented for two cells systems have been reported in the literature @xcite .",

    "requires a level of noise in both functional units sufficient to render the activity on the basin of attraction of @xmath38 .",
    "on the contrary , switching off the two functional units network can be done , for instance , by making zero the activity of one functional unit , or by doing the coupling @xmath39 lower than @xmath40 . * for @xmath41 , the active state of the network is now a period-@xmath6 oscillation , namely the period-@xmath6 cycle @xmath42 in fig .

    "but now an active state with different dynamical regimes is observed in the interval @xmath133 . if we identify the capacity of information storing with the possibility of the system to access to complex dynamical states , then , we could assert , in this sense , that a scale free network has the possibility of storing more elaborated information in the bistable region that an all - to - all network .",
    "let us note that @xmath115 also indicates a different behavior of local dissipation , as expression ( [ eq10 ] ) suggests .",
    "a positive @xmath115 means a local in - phase oscillation of the node signal and mean - field perturbations .",
    "a negative @xmath115 is meaning a local out of phase oscillation between those signal perturbations .",

    "the stability loss of the completely synchronized state is mediated by a global flip bifurcation .",
    "the new dynamical state arising from that active state for @xmath126 is a periodic pattern with a local period-@xmath6 oscillation .",
    "the increasing of the coupling parameter monitors other global bifurcations that can lead the system towards a pattern of local chaotic oscillations .",
    "we proceed now to show the different strategies for switching on and off a random scale free network .",
    "the choice of this network is suggested by the recent work @xcite on the connections distribution among functional units in the brain .",
    "they find it to be a power - law distribution .",
    "following this insight @xcite , a scale - free network following the barabsi - albert ( ba ) recipe @xcite is generated . in this model , starting from a set of @xmath134 nodes , one preferentially attaches each time step a newly introduced node to @xmath135 older nodes .",

    "this network is a clear example of a highly heterogenous network , in that the degree distribution has unbounded fluctuations when @xmath141 .",
    "the exponent reported for the brain functional network has @xmath142 .",
    "however , studies of percolation and epidemic spreading @xcite on top of scale - free networks have shown that the results obtained for @xmath139 are consistent with those corresponding to lower values of @xmath5 , with @xmath143 .",
    "as explained before , network bistability between the active and non active states is here possible in the interval @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "two different strategies @xcite can be followed to carry the network from the active state to that with no activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    * _ route i _ : by doing the coupling @xmath39 lower than @xmath144 .",
    "this is the easiest and more natural way of performing such an operation . in our naive picture of a brain - like system",
    ", it could represent the decrease ( or increase , it depends on the specific function ) of the synaptic substances that provokes the transition from the awake to the sleep state .",
    "the flux of these chemical activators is controlled by the internal circadian clock , which is present in all animals , and which seems to be the result of living during millions of years under the day / night cycle . * _ route ii _ : by switching off a critical fraction of functional units for a fixed @xmath39 .",
    "evidently , at first sight , this strategy has no relation with the behavior of a real brain - like system .",
    "thus , this is done by looking over all the elements of the network , and considering that the element activity is set to zero with probability @xmath145 ( which implies that on average @xmath146 elements are reset to zero ) .",
    "the result of this operation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",

    "consequently , it is observed that the network breaks down in many small clusters and the transition resembles that of percolation in scale free nets @xcite .",
    "two equivalent strategies @xcite can be followed for the case of turning on the network ( fig .",

    "<S> thus , the qualitative relationship with neural systems is suggested through a naive model of many of such networked logistic maps whose behavior mimics the waking - sleeping bistability displayed by brain systems . </S>",
