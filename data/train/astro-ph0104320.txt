    "quasar ultraviolet ( hereafter uv ) spectra characteristically contain broad emission lines originating in the central ( @xmath5 light year ) region , the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the strongest lines are ( the resonance lines ) ly@xmath6@xmath01216 , siiv+oiv]@xmath01400 , civ@xmath0@xmath01548,1551 , ciii ] @xmath01909 , and mgii@xmath0@xmath02796 , 2803 . for a number of years after the discovery of quasars  these lines and a few iron transitions ( greenstein & schmidt 1964 ; wampler & oke 1967 ) were the only lines detected in their uv spectra . with the availability of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , high resolution spectra , and in particular data taken with _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ (  kriss  1992 ; zheng  1995 ; zheng , kriss , & davidsen 1996 ) , _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) (  laor  1994 , 1995 ; zheng  1997 ; kriss  2000 ; kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ) , and the keck telescope (  tran , cohen & goodrich 1995 ; brotherton  1997 ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; larkin  2000 ; carson  2000 ) it has become obvious that quasar  spectra contain a plethora of weak lines as well .      in order to study  the relationship between the continuum and the line emission , the dynamical structure , the ionization balance and structure , or the chemical abundances in active galactic nuclei ( herafter agns ) and quasars  it is important to make reliable measurements of the continuum emission , the strong broad lines including the wings of their profiles , and the weak emission lines .",
    "in addition to hydrogen , helium and the above - mentioned elements , agn and quasarsalso contain atomic and ionic iron , the stable end product of nucleosynthesis . due to the large number of electron levels in iron atoms , thousands of emission line transitions are distributed throughout the uv and optical spectral regions .",
    "the weak lines , iron as well as those _ not _ being iron transitions ( hereafter ` non - iron ' lines ) , blend together , partly due to the associated transitions being very close or overlapping in energy , and partly due to the high ( presumed ) dynamic velocities of the broad - line emitting clouds broadening the lines .",
    "line widths [ fwhm , the full width at half peak flux ] of up to 10000 ^-1 kms@xmath4  have been measured ( wilkes 2000 ) .",
    "this heavy blending of weaker lines , dominated by iron transitions , forms a _ pseudo - continuum _ above the intrinsically emitted continuum ( see  figs .",
    "[ fecleanfig3c273 ] and [ fecleanfigs ] ) even in high s / n quasar  spectra ( wills  1985 ; boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ; wills  1995 ) .",
    "this pseudo - continuum severely complicates the study of both weak non - iron features , particularly important for abundance and ionization studies , and the wings of strong resonance lines . the uncertainty introduced into broad emission - line measurements by iron emission `` contamination",
    "'' can be relatively large : excluding very weak lines where it can reach @xmath7100% , a rough estimate is 5@xmath150% based on wilkes ( 1984 ) and our own line measurements before and after iron emission removal using the template presented here (   [ temp_applic ] ) .",
    "the exact level of uncertainty depends on the line transition , the line parameter measured and the overall strength of the emission line spectrum . moreover , the relative strengths of the iron features vary greatly from object to object .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by the difficulty in determining an accurate continuum level , one of the main problems in quasar  line studies , although such errors are seldom quoted .",
    "combined , these uncertainties provide a strong argument that all quasar  spectral studies should include iron emission fitting and removal .",
    "these limitations imposed by the contaminating iron emission have been known for some time (  wills & browne 1986 ) . a possible solution to the continuum level uncertainty is to use only wavelength ranges which contain pure continuum emission ( so - called _ continuum windows _ ; francis  1991 ) when fitting the continuum .",
    "however , few such regions exist and they are generally small , especially in the uv spectral region , @xmath71000 @xmath1 2000 .",
    "moreover , in objects with very broad lines even these line - free regions may be contaminated by broad line - wing emission ( boroson , persson & oke 1985 ; wills & browne 1986 ) .",
    "allowance for the optical and uv iron emission has not extensively been made , inspite of the increasing recognition of its importance for broad line studies .",
    "it was rendered a very hard task in the 1980 s by the lack of sufficient atomic data to allow identification of the iron transitions and high spectral resolution to resolve them .",
    "earlier work includes identifying the uv iron emission lines in agn [  wills , netzer & wills 1980 ; penston 1980 ; penston  1983 ( in stars ) ; hartig & baldwin 1986 , johansson & jordan 1984 ] and modeling this emission (  netzer 1980 ; kwan & krolik 1981 ; netzer & wills 1983 ; wills  1985 ; collin - souffrin  1986 ; penston 1987 ; collin - souffrin , hameury & joly 1988 ; krolik & kallman 1988 ; ferland & persson 1989 ; dumont & collin - souffrin 1990 ; netzer 1990 , and references therein ) .",
    "despite extensive efforts the current theoretical models of the optical and uv iron emission can not fully reproduce and explain the observations .",
    "fortunately , projects are under way to compute detailed radiative transition probabilities of iron atoms and ions ( the iron project : hummer  1993 ; nahar , bautista , & pradhan 1997 ; nahar et  al .",
    "2000 , and refererences therein ) and compute photoionization models of agn which also take the iron emission into account with or without exact radiative transfer ( sigut & pradhan 1998 ; `` the kentucky group '' : verner  1999 , and references therein ) based on improved atomic data (  the opacity project : seaton  1994 ) .",
    "other studies presenting iron line lists and radiative transition probabilities , which are also used here , include fuhr , martin & wiese ( 1988 ) , ekberg ( 1993 ) , giridhar & arellano ferro ( 1995 ) , nahar ( 1995 ) , nahar & pradhan ( 1996 ) , quinet ( 1996 ) , quinet , le dourneuf , & zeippen ( 1996 ) , and kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "these iron line lists are available on the world wide web .",
    "phillips ( 1977 ) was one of the first to compare the spectrum of izw1  to other seyfert galaxy spectra by broadening the former with a gaussian profile , selected to match the line widths in the latter .",
    "phillips did not subtract the iron emission but confirmed his suspicion that the feii  and hi lines have essentially the same widths and profiles .",
    "wills  ( 1985 ) simulated the feii  emission and absorption in eight low to intermediate redshift quasars  using photoionization modeling of @xmath73000 iron lines . in spite of the limitations imposed by the atomic data and computing speed at the time , they were able to reproduce the uv - optical spectra reasonably well . some deviations from the observed spectra are , however , seen ( see   [ template_comp ] ) .",
    "the photoionization models presented by wills  are specific to their individual object spectra and were not generated with a general subtraction of iron emission in agns in mind , where a typical iron spectrum is more appropriate .",
    "boroson , persson & oke ( 1985 ) made one of the first attempts to take the effects of the iron emission on broad - line studies into direct account .",
    "they estimated the uncertainty associated with line ( equivalent width , ew ) measurements as a function of line widths by broadening an agn spectrum by a hanning profile ( triangular ) with a range of widths .",
    "they found the measured ews to weaken with increasing fwhm because the continuum level becomes systematically overestimated , as the iron lines broaden and blend to form a pseudo - continuum .",
    "as a consequence , narrow lines incorrectly appear stronger .",
    "this may explain why quasars , with their broad emission lines were not recognized early on to be strong iron emitters ( phillips 1977 ; davidson & netzer 1979 ) .",
    "one way of correcting for the iron emission is to model it using the profile information of the h@xmath8  line , as the isolated feii  and h@xmath8  profiles are observed to have both similar widths and profile shapes ( phillips 1977 ; laor  1997b ; hereafter l97 ) .",
    "thus a synthetic spectrum of the iron emission can be constructed by shifting and scaling h@xmath8  profile templates according to a list of iron line positions and relative strengths .",
    "however , this method depends highly on the atomic data lists to be representative , in terms of accuracy and completeness , of the iron emission in agn and quasars .",
    "as mentioned , theoretical studies are not yet able to fully reproduce the observed iron emission , but work is in progress ( d.  verner 1998 , private communication ; verner  1999 ; see also   [ template_comp ] ) .",
    "a significant improvement in the accuracy of broad emission line measurements can be obtained by using an observed agn23 , vron - cetty & vron 1993 ) .",
    "as the methods and iron templates described here are applicable to agns as well , this fact is silently assumed in the following , when we refer to quasars  only , in addressing the use of the template . ] or quasar  iron emission template to fit and subtract the iron emission in quasar  spectra before performing line and continuum measurements .",
    "the benefits of using such a template , containing all the iron transitions typically present in quasars , are manifold . combined with the much improved atomic data , becoming increasingly available (   [ earlierfewrk ] ) ,",
    "empirical templates provide a powerful tool to study the observed iron spectrum in terms of theoretical models .",
    "this template method was adopted by bg92 , who successfully used an optical ( 4250@xmath17000 ) iron template based on the nearby , narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , izw1 , on the bright quasar survey sample .",
    "their method is described in",
    "  [ application ] .",
    "corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) use the same method with a 2300@xmath13000  uv iron template of izw1 . see   [ template_comp ] for a comparison with this template .",
    "the advent of _ hst _ uv quasar  spectral data allows us to extend the template method into the uv regime .",
    "we here present , to our knowledge , the first high s / n , high resolution , quasar  empirical uv iron template spectrum ranging from restframe @xmath0@xmath01250 to 3090  which is applicable to quasar data .",
    "the template is based on _ hst _ ( archival ) data of izw1  ( l97 ) .",
    "the method with which the template was generated is an extension of that of bg92 and corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) including a more detailed fitting of the lines which are not iron ( see   [ fetemplt ] for details and   [ template_comp ] for a discussion ) . when optical data between 3000  and 4250  become available (",
    "l97 present 3000@xmath13800  data ) , suitable for production of an intermediate wavelength iron template , the available templates will provide a powerful tool for consistent modeling of the uv and optical iron emission throughout the 1250  to 7000  region of quasar  spectra .",
    "the procedure of fitting the iron emission using an empirical template assumes that ( 1 ) the iron spectrum of izw1  is representative of quasar  iron emission spectra and that ( 2 ) all quasars  have similar iron spectra to within a scaling factor and/or a line profile broadening .",
    "not enough is currently known about the iron emission in agn to firmly assess the validity of these assumptions .",
    "though until theoretical models can explain the observed iron emission more confidently this template fitting procedure is the best available approach .",
    "we test the method by fitting several representative quasar  spectra (   [ sample_fecleaning ] ) showing that the iron emission can be well fitted if allowed the freedom to vary some of the multiplet ratios in the empirical template , indicating that the basic assumptions are valid .",
    "the iron emission templates have importance not only for our ability to fit and subtract the iron emission in quasar  spectra , but also as tools with which we can study the iron emission strengths themselves .",
    "iron is a key coolant emitting @xmath9% of the total energy output from the blr ( wills  1985 ; boller , boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) , emphasizing the importance of including the iron emission in studies of the blr .",
    "the spectra of nls1 galaxies are particularly useful for generating empirical iron templates because their strong and rich iron emission allows detection of weak iron features and identification of as many iron transitions ( figs .  [ template ] and  [ feids ] , table  [ fefits ] ,   [ lineids ] ) as are typically present in agn spectra .",
    "the relatively narrow width ( fwhm@xmath52000 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 ) of the broad emission lines permits the individual non - iron lines to be resolved , isolated , and removed from the spectrum .",
    "it also allows us to match the line width in most iron - contaminated agn spectra so as to fit and subtract the iron emission by broadening the iron template .",
    "izw1  ( pg0050@xmath10124 ; @xmath2=0.061 , see   [ dataproc ] )",
    "is classified as a nls1 and has the `` narrow '' broad emission - lines , strong feii  emission (   phillips 1976 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; lipari , terlevich , & macchetto 1993 ; pogge 2000 ; rodrguez - ardila , pastoriza & donzelli 2000 ; rudy  2000 ; but see also gaskell 2000 ) , steep soft x - ray spectra ( boller  1996 ) , and strong far - ir emission ( halpern & oke 1987 ) , typical of this class .",
    "their radio properties , however , are similar to those of other seyfert galaxies ( ulvestad , antonucci & goodrich 1995 ) .",
    "they are also variable at optical and uv wavelengths (  zwicky 1971 ; giannuzzo & stirpe 1996 ; rodrguez - pascual , mas - hesse , & santos - lleo 1997 ; leighly 1999 ; miller  2000 ) and the fastest x - ray variable agn known ( see discussion by boller  1996 ) .",
    "izw1  is a well studied object thanks in part to its relative brightness ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , its exceptionally narrow lines , its iron - rich spectrum ( sargent 1968 ; phillips 1976 , 1977 ; oke & lauer 1979 ; boroson et  al.1985 ; halpern & oke 1987 ; bg92 ; l97 ) , and its richness in low ionization lines ( persson & mcgregor 1985 ; van groningen 1993 ; l97 ; table  [ elids ] ) .",

    "the normalization of the recalibrated g130h spectrum to the g190h+g270h spectrum was determined as the ratio of the median flux in the overlapping region of the spectra ( 1.3@xmath190.56 ) . as the bluest @xmath740  of the g190h spectrum shows a relative error of 42% as opposed to 4% in g130h",

    "in fact , the poor match of the feii  emission in the g130h grating spectrum for some objects ( see   [ sample_fecleaning ] ) directly shows the need to subdivide the template in order to obtain optimum fits to agn spectra .",

    "below we briefly comment on how this compares to our template in the overlapping region .",
    "a couple of synthetic feii  spectra have been generated based on the available knowledge of the iron emission mechanism , the quality of the atomic data , and the computing facilities at the time ( wills  1985 ; verner  1999 ) .",

    "corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) present a @xmath0@xmath023003000  iron template also derived from the _ hst _ spectrum of izw1  ( l97 ) .",
    "although a detailed comparison is not possible ( the digital spectrum is not available and figure  2 in corbin & boroson ( 1996 ) shows an already broadened version of the template ) , it is clear that differences are present due to their use of interpolation rather than deblending to remove non - iron features .",
    "this is particularly clear around mgii  where interpolation across the mgii  line likely overestimates the iron emission strength by @xmath7300% ; the feiiemission level is at most 1520% of the peak height of the feii  on either side of the mgii  gap ( cf .",

    "specifically , wills  predict stronger feii  emission between @xmath71800  and @xmath72300 , and weaker feii  right around mgii  for 3c273 . in addition , the relative strength of various multiplets appear to differ between their models and the izw1  spectrum .",
    "variations in physical conditions between the nls1s , of which izw1  is considered the prototype , and the wills  quasars may also explain some of the differences .",
    "verner  ( 1999 ) present and discuss their numerical simulations of feii   emission spectra based on updated iron atomic data , iron line lists ( many of which are also used here for line identification ) , and photoionization modeling .",
    "they display the feii  emission spectrum for different densities , photon flux , micro - turbulent velocities below 100 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 , and iron abundances .",
    "although these line widths are much narrower than those of agns and quasars , complicating a comparison , a few differences between the synthetic spectra of verner  and wills  and our empirical feii  and feiii  templates can immediately be pointed out .",
    "( 1 ) the synthetic iron models contain feii  transitions only , whereas the izw1  spectrum also contain feiii  transitions .",
    "( 2 ) the synthetic spectra ( wills  1985 ; verner  1999 ) show a decrease in feii  emission above @xmath727002800 .",
    "we are not able to see this in our template as contamination by the balmer continuum ( @xmath3 @xmath0 2800   especially ) is present .",
    "the _ hst _ spectrum of izw1   alone does not allow the balmer continuum contribution to be sufficiently constrained .",
    "complete photoionization modeling is required to properly account for it . however , the balmer continuum contribution decreases continuously from @xmath73600  down to @xmath72500 . below @xmath72800",
    "it is relatively weak , and it so should not significantly contaminate our 3100 - limited iron templates .",
    "detailed comparison between the feii  template and the most recent feii   models by verner  ( 1999 ) holds great potential for significantly improving our understanding of the iron emitting mechanism and mapping the physical conditions under which the iron emission is radiated .",
    "hence , empirical iron templates remain useful even with the emergence of synthetic iron emission spectra .",
    "in order to fit and subtract iron emission from any quasar  spectrum we need to broaden the iron template to match the line width of that spectrum . this",
    "is done by convolving the original template with gaussian functions of different widths thereby creating a grid of spectra with a range of ( quantized ) widths .",
    "three steps are necessary in the iron template broadening - process : ( 1 ) the standard deviation , @xmath32 , of the convolving gaussian profile was first estimated using @xmath33 where fwhm@xmath34 = 900 ^ -1 kms@xmath4  is the line width of the izw1  spectrum . ( 2 ) to apply a constant velocity broadening the computations were carried out in logarithmic wavelength  space since @xmath35 . the process of rebinning the broadened template back to linear units results in a small additional broadening . to ensure that the final broadened template has the desired width , we performed broadening simulations on artificial data consisting of a single gaussian line feature of width 900 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 , where the width of the convolving gaussian profile , @xmath28 , was adjusted until the fwhm of the broadened feature , measured in linear wavelength   space , matched the desired width to within our measurement errors ( @xmath71 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the iron template was then convolved ( in logarithmic wavelength  space ) with a gaussian profile with the adjusted value of @xmath28 and rebinned back to linear units .",
    "we emphasize that because quasar spectral lines are often affected by blending , it is important to measure the resulting convolved width using a single artificial spectral line as outlined above , as opposed to estimating the width on the broadened ( blended ) template itself .",
    "we find blending effects to overestimate the line widths by @xmath71525% , based on simulated line blends .",
    "isolated narrow line cores , like civ  and mgii  are , however , expected to be well - determined .      in order to apply this uv iron template to quasar  spectra , both the line widths and the iron emission strength of the template must be matched to that of the quasar  spectrum .",
    "we follow the basic method of estimating the iron emission strength and subtracting the iron emission used by bg92 on the optical ( @xmath0@xmath04250@xmath1 7000 ) iron emission of their sample quasars .",
    "this method consists of artificially broadening the iron template to a number of widths by convolution with a gaussian profile (   [ tempbroad ] ) thereby generating a two - dimensional grid of templates with different line widths .",
    "bg92 scaled this `` two - dimensional template '' by a number of arbitrary , but fixed , strengths , hence creating a three - dimensional grid of templates ( with dimensions : wavelength , line width , and line strength ) .",
    "the three - dimensional iron template was subtracted from the target spectrum ( expanded to a data cube ) and the best residual ( one - dimensional ) spectrum was chosen by manual inspection .    similar to bg92 , we created a three - dimensional iron template consisting of five different scalings of a two - dimensional template , containing a number of line widths ( in the range 1000 ^ -1 kms@xmath4  @xmath1 15000 ^ -1 kms@xmath4  in steps of 250 ^ -1 kms@xmath4  is usually sufficient ) which are broadened versions of the original iron template ( intrinsic width 900 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "we also performed a manual inspection of the residual iron - subtracted spectra .",
    "our method , however , differs from that of bg92 in the following ways . after fitting and subtracting a power - law continuum fit to the iron - contaminated quasar  spectrum ,",
    "we iterate to determine the optimum parameters as follows :    * determine the iron template ( primary ) normalization for a given quasar  spectrum interactively from its iron emission strength in pure iron emission windows , specified by the user ( examples are listed in table  [ fewindows ] ) .",
    "there is a separate normalization for each ( 1-d ) template spectrum with a given broadening . *",
    "subtract a ( three - dimensional ) data cube consisting of five scaled , two - dimensional templates from the target spectrum .",
    "the scalings are ( five ) fractions of the computed normalization , and can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "a useful range is 50% @xmath1 150% of the normalization factor determined above , though the scalings @xmath36100% are rarely needed except for cross - checks . *",

    "* determine the new normalizations as in the first item above and repeat all steps iterating over both continuum setting and iron emission strength until both fits ( continuum and iron emission ) converge and the final iron - subtracted spectrum is satisfactory .    by",
    "estimating the template scaling factor interactively , we are not limited to an a priori set of quantized scalings ( the quasar  spectra can have any normalization and iron emission strength ) , and we ensure a good starting point for the iron spectrum fitting .",
    "computations of both the @xmath37 and the residual flux in the user - defined iron emission regions help us to determine the best - fitting iron spectrum objectively .",
    "iterating over both the iron emission strength and the continuum setting improves the fit to them both , especially in heavily contaminated quasar  spectra where it may be hard to define pure continuum regions over which the underlying global continuum can be fitted .",
    "we fitted the iron emission in four high - redshift and one low - redshift quasars , demonstrating the successful application of the uv iron template .",
    "we briefly summarize our main conclusions and then comment on these results for each individual quasar .",
    "the objects and their spectra were chosen to be representative of typically available data for the high - redshift quasars and to contain a range in feiiemission strength .",
    "the 3c273 _ hst _ spectrum has the advantage of covering the entire uv range .",
    "the iron template is also successfully applied to the large bright quasar survey ( forster  2001 ) .",
    "we note that a perfect fit of the izw1  iron emission templates to the iron emission in other agns is never expected .",
    "this is owing to the strong dependence of the iron emission spectrum on the physical conditions in the emitting gas and on the blr geometry ( netzer 1980 ) .",
    "this is manifested in agn spectra by variations in the strengths of the different multiplets among individual agn ( see discussion of 3c273 below ) .",
    "however , we find the template fitting to work well enough to be a valuable tool for eliminating and studying the iron emission in agns at least until accurate theoretical iron emission models are developed .    a reasonable match to the iron emission in the quasar spectra presented here",
    "could be obtained by scaling and broadening the combined feii  and feiii  uv templates , as described in ",

    "the variation in the @xmath01900 ",
    "2300 emission strength is possibly due to differing amounts of dust extinction along the line of sight towards individual objects .",
    "the general weakness of the @xmath020002300  emission in the template suggests that izw1  may be subject to high levels of dust extinction perhaps from its host galaxy and consistent with the observed strong infrared emission ( rieke & low 1972 ; rieke 1978 ) .",
    "the iron multiplet ratios may also ( or instead ) vary significantly in this region among quasars .",

    "residual emission is similarly present in the sample iron - subtracted spectrum of corbin & boroson ( 1996 ; their figure  2 ) .",
    "the overall and important conclusion is that a subdivision of the @xmath72000  wide feiiand feiii  uv templates may often be necessary because the individual multiplet strengths across the spectrum vary between objects .",
    "similarly , the feii  and feiii  templates may require different scalings as evidenced by the absence of feiii  emission in some sources (  q1451@xmath101017 ; baldwin  1996 ) . also , there is no strong direct coupling expected between the uv feiii  and feii  emission .",
    "the feii  is emitted from the partially ionized hydrogen zone while the feiii  originates in the fully ionized zone .",
    "some correlation is expected to exist as both ions are ( at least partly ) excited by the uv continuum , but the current theoretical models are not accurate enough to firmly establish a simple scaling relation between the strong multiplets of uv feii  and feiii , if one exists ( a. pradhan 2000 , private communication ) .",

    "given the lack of deblending or detailed line identification their broad component fit has an ew=21 , compared to ours of @xmath79 .",
    "baldwin  ( 1996 ) study the nature of the kinematic components in the emission line spectra of seven quasars  and , based on one of them , q0207@xmath1398 , propose that three different components are present in the line profile .",
    "they argue that q0207@xmath1398 is a `` misaligned '' broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar  as the blueshifted line emission in q0207@xmath1398 is typically absorbed in bal quasar   spectra .",
    "baldwin  also connect this blueshifted emission and absorption to the expanded photospheres of ( bloated ) stars close to the central source and argue that aliii@xmath01857 emission is an indicator of the presence of these stars .",
    "the uv spectrum of q0207@xmath1398 bears a remarkable resemblance to that of izw1   ( narrow line cores , strong aliii , feii , and feiii  emission , high density emitting regions , and blueshifted emission in the high ionization lines ) , and the different kinematical components in q0207@xmath1398 are similar to the emitting regions at different redshifts in izw1  ( phillips 1976 ; van groningen 1993 ) , providing further support for the argument that izw1  is ( also ) a `` misaligned '' bal quasar  ( l97 ) .",
    "baldwin  ( 1996 ) connect the aliii  emission to outflows ( and stars ) .",
    "so as the aliii  and feiii  emission strengths appear to be connected (  hb86 ) we speculate that the iron emission itself is somehow related to the presence of the outflows and/or to the stars .",
    "the fact that the iron line profiles do not appear asymmetric or are significantly blueshifted indicates that this emission does not originate in the outflowing gas itself . in any case , strong iron ( feii and feiii ) emission may be connected with high densities ( hb86 ; joly 1991 ; baldwin  1996 ; lawrence  1997 ; kuraszkiewicz  2000 ) .      an underlying assumption for using the izw1  spectrum as an iron template is that the iron emitting mechanism in this target is similar to that of typical quasars  and that the spectrum provides a good representation of the iron transitions and iron line ratios observed in agn and quasars .",
    "we therefore address the question of how typical the emission lines , including iron , in izw1  may be .",
    "izw1  has a number of unusual properties in addition to strong feii  emission .",

    "strong caii  emitters , however , do not otherwise appear different from those of the average agn population ( netzer 1990 ) .",
    "ciii@xmath29@xmath01175 is not a commonly detected metastable transition of ciii in agn and has previously most often been detected in absorption (  bromage  1985 , kriss  1992 ) , perhaps due to the difficulty in identifying very broad , but weak features (   [ fecorrection ] ) . see   laor  ( 1995 ) and hamann  ( 1997 ) for weak and marginal detections in emission .",
    "the line may result from the enhanced density ( see discussion by l97 ) of the emitting medium already deduced for izw1 .",
    "several studies show a trend toward strong feii , feiii , and/or aliii at higher blr densities (   [ baldwinabc ] ) .",
    "if high densities are a common property of strong iron emitters , the iron spectrum is not expected to be unusual .",
    "strong feiii  features are more prevalent in izw1 ( table  [ feids ] ) than in previous agn studies , although feiii  features at 2070 and @xmath72420 have been reported in the past ( hb86 ; l97 ) .",
    "our study suggests , however , this difference is not real but due to misidentifications in the past .",

    "the presence of both ions is potentially important for deriving the physical conditions in the iron - emitting regions , because the details of the iron emission spectrum are highly sensitive to the physical conditions (  netzer 1980 ; d.  verner , 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "lipari  ( 1993 ) and lipari ( 1994 ) link _ extremely _ strong optical feii  emission to starburst activity .",
    "though izw1  is currently undergoing vigorous star formation ( based on barvainis  1989 ; eckart   1994 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , the iron emission observed in agn is not characteristic of emission from star forming regions .",
    "pure starburst galaxies",
    "(  ngc7714 ) do not emit permitted feii   emission , only ir forbidden lines (  [ feii]1.6@xmath56 m ; l.  ho , 1998 , private communication ) mainly because the stellar ionizing continuum is too soft . to obtain the permitted lines the hard , non - thermal continuum from a central agn source",
    "is needed to penetrate to the high - density interior of the blr clouds (  netzer 1990 ) .",
    "based on the above discussion , we find no strong evidence that the iron emission in izw1  is unusual compared with that of the general quasar  population .",
    "this is confirmed by our successful fitting of the iron emission in several quasar spectra (   [ sample_fecleaning ] ) .",
    "we have presented a uv iron template based on _ hst _ archival data of izw1 , and described the method with which the template was generated . compared to previous empirical templates ( corbin & boroson 1996 ) this covers a large range ( @xmath0@xmath01250 @xmath1 3090 ) , was generated by careful fitting of the non - iron emission and absorption lines , and allowed the generation of separate feii  and feiii  templates .",
    "we have demonstrated its application to fit and remove the feii  ( and feiii ) emission in spectra of several quasars , including 3c273 , allowing subsequent studies of weak and heavily blended emission lines (  ciii ] ) free from the large uncertainties otherwise associated .",
    "this shows that the iron emission in izw1  is sufficiently similar to that in other broad - lined quasars  to be useful .",
    "although it has limitations , the iron template fitting process is an important tool to eliminate and study the iron emission in active galaxies , at least until accurate theoretical models are developed .",
    "we confirm previous results reporting the presence of blueshifted emission (   blue profile asymmetry ) in the spectrum of izw1 , especially in the high - ionization lines ( l97 ) , and of several emission regions of different ( absolute ) redshift , line width and physical conditions ( phillips 1976 ; van groningen 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of these regions along with the uv spectral properties are consistent with the picture suggested by baldwin  ( 1996 ) in which the blueshifted emission originates in the same region giving rise to the bal troughs in bal quasars .",
    "this may connect the nls1s with bals , perhaps through source orientation .",
    "we also argue that ( strong ) iron emission may be connected with high densities and to outflowing material .",
    "we discuss the fact that the siiv+oiv]@xmath01400 feature is very strong relative to civ .",
    "this can be explained by a simultaneous weakening of the carbon lines and strengthening of the silicon lines , common to narrow line seyfert 1s ( kuraszkiewicz  2000 ) , probably due to a combination of high densities and a low ionization parameter .",

    "the g270h spectrum was truncated at 3200  ( observed ) before being combined with the g430l spectrum , which then provided the mgii  line profile .",
    "there is a @xmath750 gap between the g130h and g190h spectra .",
    "an interpolation was performed using the average continuum flux levels in the @xmath740  ends of each spectrum , avoiding absorption lines , to facilitate the fitting of the iron emission .",
    "the spectra were resampled to a common dispersion of 2.37 / pix in the rest frame based on the g430l spectrum .",
    "the lower resolution of the g430l spectrum did not affect the iron fitting in any way .",
    "this was confirmed by a simultaneous fitting to the higher resolution spectrum made from the fos spectra only ( 0.44 / pix , rest frame ; no fitting to the full ` small iron bump ' was possible , however ) which showed no significant differences in the fitted models .",
    "this is most likely due to the relative broadness ( @xmath74000 ^ -1 kms@xmath4 ) of the lines in the spectrum (   [ sample_fecleaning ] ) .",

    "<S> we present an empirical template spectrum suitable for fitting and subtracting / studying the feii  and feiii  emission lines in the restframe ultraviolet spectra of quasars and active galatic nuclei , the first empirical ultraviolet iron template to cover the full range of @xmath01250@xmath13090 . </S>",

    "<S> ultraviolet spectra of active galactic nuclei and quasars . </S>",
    "<S> its presence complicates and limits the accuracy of measurements of both strong and weak emission lines and the continuum emission , affecting studies of line and continuum interrelations , the ionization structure , and elemental abundances in active galaxies and quasars . despite the wealth of work on modeling the quasar  feii  emission and the need to account for this emission in observed quasar  spectra , there is no ultraviolet template electronically available to aid this process . </S>",

    "<S> spectra of the narrow line seyfert1 galaxy , izwicky1 ( izw1 , @xmath2=0.061 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic narrow lines ( @xmath3 900 ^-1 kms@xmath4 ) of this source and its rich iron spectrum make the template particularly suitable for use with most active galactic nuclei and quasar spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the iron emission spectrum , the line identifications , and the measurements of absorption and emission lines are presented and compared with the work of laor et  al . </S>",
    "<S> comments on each individual line feature and the line fitting are available in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the methods used to develop and apply the template are also described . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the application of the derived feii  and feiii  templates by fitting and subtracting iron emission from the spectra of four high redshift quasars and of the nearby quasar , 3c273 , confirming their general applicability to active galaxies despite the somewhat unusual properties of izw1 . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the small discrepancies between the observed iron emission of these quasars and the ultraviolet template , and compare the template with previously published ones . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the advantages and limitations of the uv feii  and feiii   templates and of the template fitting method . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the templates work sufficiently well to be a valuable and important tool for eliminating and studying the iron emission in active galaxies , at least until accurate theoretical iron emission models are developed .    </S>",
    "<S> the siiv+oiv]@xmath01400 feature in izw1 is clearly strong relative to civ@xmath01549 , and civ  and ciii]@xmath01909 are both relatively weak . </S>",
    "<S> this may partially be due to the higher densities and lower ionization parameter prevailing in narrow line seyfert1 galaxies , and to the big blue bump shifting towards lower energies in more luminous seyferts , such as izw1 . in izw1  </S>",
    "<S> the narrow line width reveals that ciii ]  is heavily blended with siiii]@xmath01892 , aliii@xmath0@xmath01854,1863 , and feiii  transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the ciii ]  line strength and width may be overestimated in many quasar line studies where the lines are broader and deblending is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> this affects density estimates of the broad line region . </S>",
    "<S> photoionization modeling , including all these line features , and subsequent fitting to the spectra are required to estimate the true ciii ]  strength . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue , based on earlier work , that ( strong ) iron emission may be connected with high densities and associated with outflows . </S>"
