    "the members of the @xmath6ni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( @xmath6 = gd - lu , y ) series of compounds serve as model systems for studies of a number of phenomena : co - existence of local moment magnetism and superconductivity , non - locality and flux line lattice transitions , heavy fermion physics and complex metamagnetism @xcite .",
    "although many sophisticated experiments were performed on @xmath6ni@xmath0b@xmath0c borocarbides , data on thermal expansion ( te ) and magnetostriction ( ms ) for several members of the series exist only for limited temperature ranges , or only on polycrystalline samples , or are not available at all . for one of the less complex members of the series , non - magnetic , superconducting yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , for example",
    ", only a rather limited set of results has been disseminated @xcite . in this publication",
    "we report anisotropic ( @xmath4-axis and @xmath7-plane ) te and longitudinal , low temperature , ms measurements on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals grown by two different techniques and well - characterized by other methods .",
    "the objective for this work is manifold : to acquire data that can serve as a baseline in studies of te in more complex , magnetic or strongly correlated , borocarbides ; to probe the irreversible properties in intermediate superconducting state ; and finally , to evaluate the uniaxial pressure derivatives of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c from the anomalies in te at @xmath5 ( using the the thermodynamic ehrenfest relation ) , an approach proven viable _",
    "e.g. _ in htsc @xcite , and compare the results with the implications of the analysis in ref . @xcite .",
    "two yni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystals were used in this work .",
    "one of them ( sample a throughout the rest of the text ) was grown by a ni@xmath0b high temperature flux method ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "this method yields plate - like crystals with the @xmath4-axis perpendicular to the plates .",
    "the crystal was shaped into a nearly rectangular bar , with two pairs of parallel surfaces , so that te and ms were measured along [ 100 ] ( @xmath8 mm ) and [ 001 ] ( @xmath9 mm ) directions .",
    "another crystal ( sample b ) was grown using vertical zone melting method with a commercial 4-mirrors image furnace ( model fz - t-4000-h - vi - vpm - pc , crystal systems corp . , japan ) .",
    "we used drop cast polycrystalline rods ( @xmath10 mm diameter , @xmath11 mm long ) as feeding rod and crystal support .",
    "high purity argon at atmospheric pressure was used as a protective atmosphere inside the quartz working tube .",
    "feeding and bottom shafts were rotated in opposite directions to insure an effective stirring of the molten zone , typically at + 10 and -35 rpm . during the growth ,",
    "the growth speed was decreased from 10 to 2 mm / h to favor the formation of large , single grains .",
    "the phase purity of the single crystals was checked by debye - sherrer powder diffraction pattern and compared to original feeding rod spectrum .",
    "no detectable extra reflections due to impurity phases or changes of cell parameters were observed .",
    "an as - grown bar was oriented with a laue camera and cut into a close to prismoidal shape with two pairs of parallel surfaces , so that te and ms were measured along [ 110 ] ( @xmath12 mm ) and [ 001 ] ( @xmath13 mm ) directions . after shaping",
    ", both samples were annealed in dynamic vacuum ( @xmath14 torr ) at 950@xmath15 c @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that for reasons unrelated to the objectives of this work , the sample a was grown with isotopically pure @xmath16b and the sample b with @xmath17b .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed using a commercial mpms-5 ( quantum design , inc . ) squid magnetometer ; ac resistance ( @xmath18 hz , @xmath19 ma ) and heat capacity were measured with act and heat capacity options of a ppms-9 instrument ( quantum design , inc . ) .",
    "thermal expansion and magnetostriction were measured using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of ofhc copper ; a detailed description of the dilatometer will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the capacitance was measured with an andeen - hagerling 2500a capacitance bridge ( the bridge resolution of 10@xmath20 pf corresponds to a sample dilation measurement limit of about 0.3 pm when the dilatometer is operating near 20 pf ) .",
    "the dilatometer was mounted in a ppms-14 instrument ( quantum design inc . ) and was operated over a temperature range of 1.8 to 305 k and in magnetic fields up to 140 koe ( either in vacuum or with a small amount of helium exchange gas to minimize thermal gradients ) .",
    "the temperature was measured with a calibrated cernox-1030 thermometer ( lakeshore cryotronics ) mounted on the dilatometer .",
    "the field dependence of the dilatometer was less than @xmath21 over @xmath22 koe and will be ignored .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dilatometer ( or `` cell effect '' ) is removed using published values of the thermal expansion of copper @xcite .",
    "data were acquired with the temperature increasing at a rate of about 0.4 k / min or with the field changing at a rate of about 6 koe / min .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the dilatometer was checked with measurements on a 4 mm sample of pure aluminum that were compared to published values @xcite . the average deviation between our aluminum te measurements and those in the literature over our full temperature range is @xmath23 k@xmath24 .",
    "the average fractional deviation of our aluminum measurements from those in the literature is about 1% above 40 k but becomes larger at low temperatures where the thermal expansion of aluminum is sensitive to both sample purity and preparation @xcite .",
    "the maximum deviation of @xmath25 k@xmath24 occurred at 300 k and corresponds to a fractional deviation of 1.2% from published values .",
    "we estimate an experimental uncertainty of @xmath26 k@xmath24 in our thermal expansion measurements from the mean deviation to a fit of our aluminum data near 20 k , this corresponds to a dilation uncertainty less than 0.5  / k .",
    "superconducting transitions , as measured by dc magnetization , zero field resistivity and heat capacity , are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . in all three measurements",
    "the transitions are sharp , being sharper for sample a. the @xmath5 values as defined by @xmath27 , onset of diamagnetism in @xmath28 measurements and mid - point of the heat capacity rise ( or by balancing of the normal state and superconducting state entropies ) are @xmath29 k and @xmath30 k for samples a and b respectively .",
    "this difference in @xmath5 between samples a and b is partially due to the boron isotope effect @xcite and partially due to different scattering in two samples as can be see from the difference in the residual resistivity ratio , @xmath31k@xmath32k@xmath33 63 and 16 for a and b respectively @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that sample b had a small , rather broad , bump in resistivity near 30 k , feature that was not observed in the sample a or other flux - grown yni@xmath0b@xmath0c samples .    temperature - dependent linear and volume ( defined here as @xmath34 ) dilations ( relative to the values at 1.9 k ) for two samples",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the two crystals behave very similarly with the slight discrepancy most probably reflecting the accuracy of the measurements of the room temperature dimensions and their changes and possible , slight imperfections in the shape of the samples . in -",
    "plane linear and volume thermal dilations are positive in the temperature range studied .",
    "the @xmath4-axis thermal dilation is negative at low temperatures , it changes its sign at about 200 k.    temperature - dependent linear and volume thermal expansion coefficients measured on samples a and b are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath35 data for both samples are very similar , as well as the @xmath36 data above @xmath37 k. further studies will be required to understand whether the broad maximum in @xmath38}(t)$ ] of the sample a at about 80 k is a real feature albeit it was reproducible in two consecutive measurements : , one in high vacuum mode of the ppms , another with low pressure he exchange gas in the sample chamber .",
    "our data are compared with the published data @xcite obtained by powder and single crystal x - ray diffraction at different temperatures . to be consistent with the fig . 3 and results for @xmath39 in the table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath40 data cited in ref .",
    "@xcite for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c should be divided by 10 .",
    "such `` corrected '' @xmath40 data together with the @xmath41 and @xmath39 data from the table 3 , ref .",
    "@xcite are included in fig .",
    "our data are consistent with the published values @xcite .    the temperature dependence of the linear thermal expansion coefficients close to @xmath5 is presented in fig .",
    "jumps in @xmath42 are seen unambiguously , with the opposite sign of the jumps for @xmath43 and @xmath40 and very similar , within the errors of the measurements , values for both samples . using results from the heat capacity ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and thermal expansion coefficients ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) measurements , the uniaxial pressure derivatives of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath5 , can be calculated using the thermodynamic ehrenfest relation :    @xmath44 ^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is a molar volume of the material ( for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , @xmath46 @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the jumps in the @xmath50-th thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat at @xmath5 .",
    "estimates of the uniaxial pressure derivatives for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c based on the aforementioned measurements are summarized in table [ tab ] . within the 10 - 20% error bars in @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) there is no significant difference in estimated uniaxial pressure derivatives for two samples . in the table",
    "the @xmath53 defined in such way lacks the contribution from the off - diagonal @xmath54 terms that play a role in the experimentally measured @xmath55 under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "since the off - diagonal terms are usually significantly smaller then the diagonal ones , we can still compare the last column of the table [ tab ] with the experimentally measured hydrostatic pressure derivatives .",
    "the experimental data on @xmath55 of yni@xmath0b@xmath0c were presented in a number of publications , some of the reported values are listed below ( in k / kbar ) : @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 ( in @xmath59 limit ) @xcite , and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "all but one of these results are consistent with our estimates .",
    "we are unaware of any direct uniaxial pressure measurements on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c other than very short conference proceedings publication @xcite , that contains a statement that for this material @xmath5 is almost independent on ( uniaxial ) pressure , again in agreement with our estimates of @xmath60 ( table [ tab ] ) .",
    "the uniaxial pressure derivatives obtained from the ehrenfest relations in this work differ in value and , more importantly , have the signs opposite to the ones inferred in ref .",
    "the procedure used there was indirect , based on a number of assumptions ( the most important , but not universally correct , being equivalence of physical and chemical pressure ) , had to rely ( due to the nature of the doping used ) on refining of the structural data of two - phase samples , and therefore is open for discussions and criticism . on the other hand ,",
    "it is noteworthy that additionally our current results ( table [ tab ] ) apparently contradict the implications of the band - structure calculations @xcite that superconductivity in rni@xmath0b@xmath0c is controlled by the static tetrahedral nib@xmath61 geometry . within the model of ref .",
    "@xcite superconductivity is more favorable for rni@xmath0b@xmath0c compounds with the b - ni - b tetrahedral angle @xmath62 closer to the ideal value of @xmath63 . for all rni@xmath0b@xmath0c compounds @xmath64 ( for yni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "then a compression along the @xmath4-axis will cause a decrease in @xmath62 bringing it further away from the @xmath66 , and in-@xmath7 plane compression will yield an increase in @xmath62 so that it will approach @xmath66 , consequently the signs of the uniaxial pressure derivatives of @xmath5 expected from @xcite are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , opposite to that evaluated from the te experiment ( table [ tab ] ) .",
    "magnetostriction loops taken at different temperatures , both in superconducting and normal state , for field applied in the @xmath7 plane , are shown in fig .",
    "magnetostriction in superconducting state depends on number of parameters , including the extrinsic ones , like shape of the sample , pinning strength and its field dependence @xcite . moreover , irreversible flux pinning induced magnetostriction causes ( geometry - dependent ) shape distortions @xcite that add additional requirements on mounting of the sample in the experimental cell for detailed study of the critical superconducting state via magnetostriction . here we will just mention that in both samples the magnetostriction in the intermediate superconducting state is high ( @xmath69 ) , significantly higher than that seen for the polycrystalline sample @xcite , in both samples the features associated with peak effect @xcite or `` dip '' in magnetization @xcite are apparently seen , with some structure for the sample b. in the normal state magnetostriction is rather small . in superconducting state , for magnetic fields appreciably lower than @xmath2 , the irreversible magnetostriction is much higher for the sample b , consistent with its lower @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and higher pinning in this sample .    for field",
    "applied along @xmath4-direction the quantitative difference in the irreversible magnetostriction in superconducting state between two samples is even more drastic that for @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "very large , ( @xmath72 ) effect is seen for sample b and is possibly associated with the peak ( and/or `` dip '' ) effect .",
    "much smaller feature in the irreversible magnetostriction is seen below @xmath2 in the sample a.    the magnetostriction data allow for an estimate of the @xmath2 ( defined here as the high field onset of the peak / dip effect feature ) .",
    "the anisotropic data for both samples are shown in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and its anisotropy ( @xmath73 ) are consistent with the previous results obtained from magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements @xcite , being on the lower end of the reported values for the @xmath2 anisotropy .",
    "the observation that @xmath2 is lower for the sample with lower @xmath70 is broadly consistent with the results _",
    "e.g. _ on y(ni@xmath74co@xmath75)@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite and ( y@xmath74lu@xmath75)ni@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite , however it disagrees with the generally expected increase of @xmath2 with decrease of the mean free path ( decrease of @xmath70 ) expected for conventional superconductors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "careful study , by several techniques , of @xmath2 and its anisotropy in rni@xmath0b@xmath0c and in particular in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c as a function of its mean free path is a topic of interest for a separate study .    a striking feature in high field magnetostriction of the sample a is clearly seen quantum oscillations ( fig . [ f6]a ) , that start in the still superconducting , irreversible , region ( at approximately 0.7 @xmath2 at @xmath76 k ) and continue , with growing amplitude , in higher fields ( similarly , the oscillations are present for the sample b , but the y - scale in fig .",
    "[ f6]b does not allow to see them , see below ) .",
    "quantum oscillations in magnetostriction is a known , albeit not so common phenomenon @xcite , that requires high quality crystals and sensitive measurement techniques to be observed .",
    "these oscillations are present , with smaller amplitude , at least up to @xmath77 k and are observed as well in the sample b. magnetostriction data as a function of inverse magnetic field for three different temperatures are shown in figures [ f7]a ( sample a ) and [ f8]a ( sample b ) . at base temperature",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations for the sample a is @xmath78 times higher , consistent with lower scattering in this sample .",
    "the fourier transformation of the data ( figures [ f7]b , [ f8]b ) reveals one frequency , @xmath79 mg .",
    "the effective mass , @xmath80 , corresponding to this orbit can be estimated from the slope of the @xmath81 vs. @xmath82 plot ( @xmath83 - amplitude of the oscillations in some chosen field ) @xcite .",
    "for samples a and b this procedure results in values 0.38 @xmath84 and 0.43 @xmath84 respectively ; in average : @xmath85 .",
    "quantum oscillations in magnetization ( de haas - van alphen effect ) in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c were described in number of publications ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the aforementioned oscillations in magnetostriction are consistent , both in frequency and effective mass values , with the strongest frequency observed by a conventional de haas - van alphen effect measurements , the @xmath86 orbit on the fermi surface part formed by the 17th band .",
    "in summary , the te measurements allow us to estimate uniaxial pressure derivatives of @xmath5 which have different signs for pressure applied in the @xmath7 plane and along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the results call for re - evaluation of the role of nib@xmath61 structural unit on superconductivity in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "the irreversible ms in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c is large , complex , has features associated with the peak ( and/or `` dip '' ) effect near @xmath5 and is open for further , detailed studies of pinning .",
    "quantum oscillations in ms ( analog of de haas - van alphen effect ) were observed for @xmath1 .",
    "the frequency was identified as the @xmath86 orbit previously seen in magnetization .",
    "if combined with high field magnetization measurements on the same crystals , the oscillatory ms will allow for estimate of evolution of the extremal orbit area under uniaxial stress @xcite .",
