    "after the lhc discovery of the higgs boson with properties consistent with the standard model ( sm ) expectations  @xcite , the priority in high - energy particle physics is more - than - ever focused on looking for evidences of `` new physics '' that can help explain the many fundamental problems still open in the field ( nature of dark matter , matter - antimatter asymmetry , unnatural gap between the electroweak and planck scales , ... ) . at cern , the design study of the future circular collider ( fcc ) has been launched to pursue the searches of physics beyond the sm in a new 80100  km tunnel once the lhc research project is completed  @xcite . running in its first phase as a very - high - luminosity electron - positron collider , the fcc - ee(formerly known as tlep  @xcite )",
    "will provide unique possibilities for indirect searches of new phenomena through high - precision tests of the sm by collecting tens of ab@xmath4 integrated luminosities at the @xmath5 pole ( @xmath6  gev ) , the @xmath7-pair production threshold ( @xmath8  gev ) , the @xmath9 higgs - strahlung maximum around @xmath10  gev , and the @xmath11 threshold ( @xmath12  gev ) .",
    "+ beyond the rich physics programme in electron - positron collisions , the fcc - ee  will provide an ideal environment to study @xmath13 collisions at unprecedented energies and luminosities . though photon - fusion processes have been usually considered at dedicated high - energy photon - colliders through compton - backscattering of laser light  @xcite , they can also be studied using the photons radiated from the @xmath2 beams .",
    "indeed , any relativistic charged particle generates a flux of quasi - real ( weizscker - williams ) photons , theoretically described using the effective photon approximation ( epa )  @xcite , which can be used for photoproduction studies .",
    "the physics of two - photon collisions has been an active topic of research at @xmath2 , proton , and ion colliders ( see e.g.  @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the @xmath13 kinematics can be constrained measuring the scattered leptons with near - beam detectors at low angles , while the produced system is reconstructed from its decaying products in the central detector . in this work ,",
    "we are interested , first , in the @xmath14 process , considered before in the context of photon  @xcite , proton  @xcite and heavy - ion  @xcite colliders",
    ". the huge luminosities available at fcc - ee  provide the means to observe such a process which , to our knowledge , has not been studied before in @xmath2 two - photon epa collisions .",
    "the second measurement of interest is @xmath15 , which is a very suitable process to test the electroweak sector of the sm as it probes trilinear @xmath16 and quartic @xmath17 boson couplings .",
    "the few counts of two - photon production of @xmath1 observed for the first time at the lhc  @xcite have improved the limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings ( aqgc ) using dimension- 6 and 8 effective operators parameters . the cleaner environment and huge luminosities of @xmath2 collisions at the fcc - ee",
    "will lead to hundreds of ww pairs observed and , thus , much more stringent aqgc limits .",

    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the threshold of production for the two processes considered here .",
    "photon - fusion higgs production can be in principle observed at fcc - ee  running at @xmath20  =  160  gev , although the best conditions for measuring both processes are provided by @xmath2 at @xmath21  gev . in this case , the @xmath19 is 20 times greater than at the lhc , with the advantage of the absence of pile - up collisions .",
    "all charges accelerated at high energies generate electromagnetic fields which , in the epa approach , can be considered as quasi - real ( low virtuality ) photon beams . after interacting with each other , the two photons can produce various exclusive final states @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 , where @xmath23 is either @xmath1 or the higgs boson in this work ( diagrams in fig .  [ diagrams ] ) , and the radiated leptons are scattered at very small angles with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the production cross sections are computed in a factorized way through the convolution of the epa photon fluxes and the elementary @xmath25 process described by exact matrix elements and kinematics . although various monte carlo ( mc ) event generators such as pythia  6  @xcite , madgraph  5  @xcite , whizard  @xcite or superchic  2  @xcite have in principle the possibility to run @xmath13 collisions in the epa mode , not all production processes are available and/or the simulation of the outgoing @xmath2 kinematics is not always exact ( and such information is crucial for realistic studies of the @xmath2 tagging probability ) . in this study , we employ two different mc codes , madgraph  5 ( version 2.1.1 ) and pythia  6 ( version 6.4.28 ) , to study respectively higgs and @xmath1 two - photon production . +     diagrams for @xmath1 ( left ) and higgs boson ( right ) @xmath26-fusion production in @xmath2 collisions . ]",
    "we run madgraph  5 with the effective field theory ( heft ) approach , where the scalar higgs couples directly to photons , combined with the epa to compute the cross sections for the process @xmath27 , and the relevant continuum backgrounds @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 being light quarks ) . the final - states are studied at the parton level , i.e. neither quark showering nor hadronization and decays are considered for this preliminary study ( a more complete analysis is in progress ) .",
    "the simulated signal and background samples for @xmath30  jets were generated using pythia  6  @xcite in the epa approach ( process id=69 , which properly accounts for the scattered @xmath31 kinematics ) and full parton - shower and hadronization of the jets from the w decays . with both gauge bosons",
    "@xmath32 producing four jets in the final state , the statistics is maximized due to the higher branching ratio compared to the leptonic decay channels used in the cms analyses in p - p  at 7 and 8  tev  @xcite .",
    "the visible cross sections for @xmath33 obtained with madgraph  5 are @xmath34  =  20  ab and 85  ab in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3160  gev and 240  gev respectively , assuming a 70% reconstruction / tagging efficiency for each single @xmath35-jet ( which leads to a combined 50% efficiency for the @xmath0 signal ) .",
    "the main backgrounds to the signal are the continuums @xmath36 , and @xmath37 where the charm and light quarks are misidentified as @xmath35-quarks .",
    "assuming @xmath35-jet mistagging probabilities of 5% for a @xmath38-quark , and 1.5% for a light - quark , effective reductions of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 continuum backgrounds by factors of about 400 and @xmath41 , respectively , are achieved .",
    "taking all these factors into account , the backgrounds are still about 30 times larger than the signal in the region of jet - pair invariant masses @xmath42 around the higgs peak , but can be safely reduced with a few kinematics cuts that are described below in detail and summarized in table  [ table1 ] . figure  [ higgsnocuts ] compares the @xmath35-jets kinematical distributions for the signal and backgrounds for @xmath2 collisions at @xmath43  gev .",

    "all distributions are normalized to their visible cross sections assuming the @xmath35-jet reconstruction and ( mis)tagging efficiencies quoted in the text . ]    in order to remove the continuum backgrounds , several cuts can be applied according to the study  @xcite and the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ higgsnocuts ] .",
    "first , since the transverse momenta of the higgs decay @xmath35-jets peak at @xmath50 , selecting events with at least one jet within @xmath51  53.562.5 gev / c suppresses @xmath5295% of the backgrounds , while removing only @xmath5250% of the signal .",
    "second , the two decay @xmath35-jets are emitted isotropically in the higgs c.m .",
    "system , and their distribution in the helicity frame is peaked at @xmath53 , i.e. emitted either roughly in the same direction as the @xmath0 pair or opposite to it , while the continuum whose relevant feynman diagrams have quarks propagating in the t- or u- channel is peaked in the forward and backward directions .",
    "thus , independently requiring @xmath54 suppresses @xmath5290% of the continuum contaminations while still keeping @xmath5255% of signal .",
    "combination of both criteria enhances the ( s)ignal/(b)ackground by a factor of @xmath5215 ( if needed one could further exploit the jet pseudorapidity distributions , which are peaked around @xmath55  0 for the signal and more spread out for the continuum ) .",
    "the final higgs yield extraction is obtained integrating the invariant mass distribution of the jet pairs within @xmath56  115135  gev / c@xmath57 , i.e. @xmath582@xmath59 around the assumed @xmath523.5  gev per - jet energy resolution .",
    "this has no effect on the final signal but further reduces 69% of the backgrounds below the ( now narrower ) peak region considered .",
    "it s worth mentioning that we did nt consider any non-@xmath13 backgrounds from @xmath60 processes .",
    "our assumption is that all such events are removed by requiring a double - tagging condition on opposite - sign electron / positron at each side of the detector , with kinematics consistent with the reconstructed central system .",
    "we assume e@xmath61 detection over @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the angle of the scattered @xmath64 with respect to the beam , and 50% of efficiency for the double - tagging of @xmath13 events .",

    "in addition , we assume the tagging of both scattered leptons , within the polar angle acceptance range @xmath85 , with a 50% efficiency .",
