    "the formal problem of constructing a relativistically invariant quantum theory amounts to finding a representation of the poincar generators in terms of self - adjoint operators that act on an appropriate hilbert space and satisfy the poincar algebra .",
    "if one is interested in interacting theories this is a non - trivial task .",
    "the commutation relation @xmath0=i \\hat{p}^j\\ ] ] between the generator for time translations @xmath1 and the boost generators @xmath2 already indicates that interaction terms must appear in more than one of the poincar generators .",
    "if interaction terms show up in @xmath1 , then @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( or both ) must be interaction dependent too .",
    "a particular form of relativistic dynamics is then characterized by the set of poincar generators that contain interactions . in dirac s seminal paper on the forms of classical relativistic dynamics the interaction dependent (",
    "dynamical ) poincar generators were called hamiltonians ``  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent forms are the instant form '' ( if ) , the front form `` ( ff ) , and the point form '' ( pf ) with the corresponding sets of hamiltonians being given by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . among these forms",
    "the point form is the least known and , although it has definite virtues , the least utilized .",
    "an obvious advantage is the clean separation of poincar generators that are interaction dependent from those which are free of interactions .",
    "the former are components of a 4-vector @xmath7 whereas the latter can be combined into an antisymmetric lorentz tensor @xmath8 .",
    "this makes it possible to express equations in point form in a manifestly lorentz covariant way and makes for simple behavior under rotations and boosts .",
    "the conditions for poincar invariance can , e.g. , be phrased in terms of the point - form equations \" @xmath9&=&0\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{u}_\\lambda \\hat{p}^\\mu \\hat{u}_\\lambda^\\dag & = & \\left ( \\lambda^{-1 } \\right)^\\mu_\\nu \\hat{p}^\\nu \\ , , \\label{eq : pfeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the unitary operator representing the lorentz transformation @xmath11 on the hilbert space .",
    "the lorentz part of the poincar commutation relations has been integrated out , which is possible due to the kinematic nature of the rotation and boost generators .",
    "the usual procedure for constructing a representation of the poincar algebra on a hilbert space is canonical quantization of a local field theory .",
    "the interaction dependence of the poincar generators is then determined by the quantization surface . if the surface is chosen as the forward hyperboloid @xmath12 all interactions go into @xmath7 and one ends up with point - form quantum field theory ( pfqft )  @xcite .",
    "a quantized field theory is intrinsically a many - body theory with infinitely many degrees of freedom with the representation space being a fock space .",
    "relativistic invariance follows automatically if one starts from a poincar - scalar langrangean density .",
    "the problem of constructing a relativistically invariant quantum theory for a restricted number of particles is more intricate .",
    "interaction terms that show up in the dynamical poincar generators are , in general , subject to non - linear constraints which are imposed by the poincar algebra .",
    "a particular solution to the problem of finding a consistent set of 10 poincar generators for an interacting quantum mechanical system with finitely many degrees of freedom was discovered by bakamjian and thomas  @xcite . if their construction is carried out in point form the resulting ( interacting ) 4-momentum operator @xmath7 is seen to separate into an interacting mass operator @xmath13 and a free velocity operator @xmath14 , @xmath15 the pf eqs .",

    "the operator for the total spin of the ( interacting ) system is not affected by interactions",
    ". however , different forms of dynamics are , in general , associated with different definitions of the spin ( canonical spin , helicity , front - form spin , @xmath18 ) , which are related via the unitary melosh transformation \"  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the bakamjian - thomas approach it is possible to construct poincar invariant models with instantaneous interactions ( action - at - a - distance ) .",
    "what one looses with instantaneous interactions as compared to a local quantum field theory is , however , microcausality . in relativistic quantum mechanics this property",
    "is replaced by the weaker condition of cluster separability ( or macrocausality )  @xcite .",
    "macrocausality roughly means that disjunct subsystems of a quantum mechanical system should behave independently of each other , if they are separated by sufficiently large space - like distances .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pfqm ] we will show that retardation effects in particle - exchange interactions can be accommodated within the bakamjian - thomas framework by means of a multichannel formulation .",
    "this multichannel framework will then be used to derive electroweak current matrix elements and form factors of bound few - body systems . in this context",
    "it will be necessary to discuss the question of cluster separability , as it plays a role in the extraction of form factors .",
    "a further example shows that such a coupled - channel approach could also be used to formulate constituent quark models that lead to unstable excited states , i.e. resonances with finite ( non - perturbative ) decay widths .",
    "section  [ sec : pfqft ] is devoted to point - form quantum field theory .",
    "we will give a few applications for which field quantization on a space - time hyperboloid could be advantageous as compared to usual equal - time quantization .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] finally contains our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "our first aim will be to describe particle - exchange interactions within the bakamjian - thomas approach in such a way that retardation effects are fully taken into account .",
    "this can be done within a multichannel framework that allows for the creation and annihilation of a finite number of additional particles . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pfbt ] ) it is clear that it suffices to study the eigenvalue problem for the mass operator .",
    "let us start with a 2-channel system in which an @xmath19-particle channel is coupled to an @xmath20-particle channel .",
    "the mass - eigenvalue problem for such a system can be written as @xmath21 with a matrix mass operator that acts on the direct sum of @xmath19- and @xmath20-particle hilbert spaces . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath19- and @xmath20-particle components of the mass eigenstate with mass eigenvalue @xmath24 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the mass operator @xmath25 , @xmath26 represent the invariant masses of the uncoupled @xmath19- and @xmath20-particle systems .",
    "in addition to the relativistic kinetic energies of the particles these operators may contain instantaneous interactions between the particles . in the forthcoming applications to constituent - quark models",
    "an instantaneous confinement between the ( anti)quarks is , e.g. , put into @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath27 is the vertex operator that accounts for the creation of the additional particle .    for our further purposes",
    "it is useful to apply a feshbach reduction to eq .",
    "( [ eq : massev ] ) and eliminate the @xmath20-particle channel in favor of the @xmath19-particle channel : @xmath28 the optical potential @xmath29 introduced in this way is a function of the mass eigenvalue @xmath24 and consists of all possibilities to exchange the ( @xmath30)st particle between the remaining particles .",
    "it also includes loop contributions , i.e. absorption by the emitting particle .",
    "@xmath31 describes the propagation of the @xmath20-particle intermediate state and is thus responsible for retardation effects .    in order to analyze eq .",
    "( [ eq : vopt ] ) in some more detail it is appropriate to introduce a set of basis states that is tailored to the point - form version of the bakamjian - thomas construction : @xmath32 such states are called velocity states \" .",
    "a velocity state is a usual multiparticle momentum state in the rest frame ( @xmath33 ) that is boosted to overall 4-velocity @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) by means of a canonical spin boost @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37s denote the spin projections of the individual particles .",
    "a velocity state is a simultaneous eigenstate of the free @xmath38-particle mass operator @xmath39 ( eigenvalue @xmath40 ) and the 4-velocity operator @xmath41 ( eigenvalue @xmath42 ) . in a velocity - state representation of a bakamjian - thomas type model the overall velocity of the system",
    "can always be factored out as a velocity - conserving delta function , leaving an equation for the pure internal motion .",
    "a further advantage of velocity states is that angular momenta can be coupled together as in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the velocity - state representation can now be used to specify the vertex operator @xmath27 by relating it to an appropriate field theoretical interaction density @xmath43 .",

    "this relativistic coupled - channel framework with field - theory motivated vertex interactions has already been applied to several problems . in ref .",
    "@xcite the mass operator for @xmath49-@xmath19 and @xmath19-@xmath19 scattering has been derived using chiral perturbation theory . in the following we are going to show how",
    "electromagnetic hadron form factors can be extracted from the optical one - photon - exchange potential for electron scattering off confined ( anti)quarks  @xcite .",
    "a most recent application , which we are also going to discuss , is the construction of constituent quark models that lead to resonance - like behavior for hadron excitations .",
    "electromagnetic hadron form factors are observables that encode the electromagnetic structure of hadrons .",
    "the theoretical analysis of hadron form factors amounts to the question of how the electromagnetic current @xmath50 of a hadron may be expressed in terms of the electromagnetic currents of its constituents .",
    "it has long been recognized that binding effects must appear in @xmath50 and it can not be a simple sum of constituent currents  @xcite . the 3 basic constraints that a model for the electromagnetic hadron current has to satisfy are poincar covariance , current conservation and the requirement that the hadron charge should not be renormalized by binding effects ( i.e. correct normalization of form factors at vanishing momentum transfer )  @xcite .",
    "general procedures for the construction of model currents of bound few - body systems that satisfy these constraints are given in refs .",
    "both papers use the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics and the breit frame , in which the constraints on @xmath50 are most easily satisfied , for their analysis . due to the kinematic nature of lorentz boosts in point",
    "form the model current constructed in the breit frame is then readily transformed into an arbitrary frame .",
    "given the bound - state wave function of a few - body system , this construction generates a whole class of currents that satisfy the 3 basic constraints .",
    "one of the admissible currents is the spectator current , in which only one of the constituents is active , whereas the other ones are just spectators .    in the following",
    "we will present a different strategy and rather try to _ derive _ a microscopic model for a hadron current that is consistent with the binding forces than to construct it ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to do this we will use the poincar invariant coupled channel framework just introduced and study the full physical electron - hadron scattering process and not just the emission and absorption of a virtual photon by the hadron . to be more specific , let us consider a pion within a constituent - quark model .",
    "electron - pion scattering is then treated as a 2-channel problem .",
    "the first channel is the @xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 channel , the second the @xmath51@xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 one . in this way",
    "the dynamics of the exchange photon is fully taken into account .",

    "this is , however , not possible in our case .",
    "the reason is that our derivation of the current is based on the bakamjian - thomas construction which is known to provide wrong cluster properties  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can not be sure that the hadronic current we get does not also depend on the electron momenta .",
    "what we find is indeed that @xmath72 can not be fully expressed in terms of hadronic covariants , but one needs 1 additional ( current conserving ) covariant , which is the sum of the 2 electron momenta : @xmath77 this decomposition holds for arbitrary values of the meson momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 with only one exception , the breit frame ( i.e. backward scattering in the electron - meson center of mass system ) . in this frame the 2 covariants become proportional and it is not possible to separate the 2 form factors .",
    "wrong cluster properties may also influence the form factors @xmath78 such that they not only depend on the squared 4-momentum transfer at the photon - pion vertex , but also on mandelstam @xmath79 , i.e. the square of the invariant mass of the electron - meson system .     and of the spurious pion form factor @xmath80 ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : jparam ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffs ] .",
    "one first observes that both , the physical form factor @xmath83 and the spurious form factor @xmath80 depend on @xmath84 ( or mandelstam @xmath79 ) .",
    "this @xmath79 dependence of @xmath83 vanishes rather quickly with increasing invariant mass . at the same time",
    "the spurious form factor @xmath80 is seen to vanish .",
    "it is thus suggestive to take the limit @xmath85 to get a sensible result for the pion form factor . in this limit",
    "the microscopic pion current factorizes explicitly into a point - like pion current times a @xmath82 dependent integral which can be identified as pion form factor : @xmath86 the final result for the form factor has a simple analytical form and can be proved to be equivalent to the standard front form expression for a spectator current in the @xmath87 frame  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath85 limit removes effects due to violation of cluster separability seems to have a plausible explanation : in order to separate subsystems by space - like distances in point form it is natural to use boosts . in this way one stays on the quantization hypersurface .",
    "separation by boosts , however , increases the invariant mass of the whole system . or , reversing the argument , by taking @xmath79 large we separate the electron from the meson such that it does not affect the meson structure .",
    "this procedure for the calculation of form factors can immediately be generalized to electroweak form factors of arbitrary bound few - body systems .",
    "very recently it has been applied to electroweak form factors of heavy - light mesons  @xcite .",
    "we have been able to derive a simple analytical expression for the isgur - wise function and to prove that the form - factor relations due to heavy - quark symmetry are recovered in the heavy - quark limit @xmath88 .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors of spin-1 bound states , like the deuteron , are presently under investigation . here",
    "it turns out that one can not completely get rid of the problems associated with cluster separability by taking the @xmath89 limit .",
    "covariant structures in which @xmath90 is contracted with the in- and outgoing polarization vectors of the spin-1 particle do not vanish in this limit .",
    "but our findings resemble those of ref .",
    "@xcite that have been obtained within a covariant light - front approach . in this paper the authors also encounter spurious contributions to the current which are associated with a 4-vector @xmath91 that characterizes the orientation of the light front .",
    "these spurious contributions correspond exactly to our spurious contributions which have their origin in the violation of cluster separability .",
    "their presence guarantees that the angular condition for the ( spin ) matrix elements of the physical part of the current is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "this means that there is also a connection between the angular condition and cluster separability .",
    "the resonance character of hadron excitations is usually ignored when calculating hadron spectra within constituent quark models .",
    "hadron excitations rather come out as stable bound states and their bound - state wave function is subsequently used to calculate partial decay widths perturbatively by assuming a particular model for the decay vertex on the constituent level .",
    "the observation that the predicted strong decay widths are notoriously too small  @xcite is an indication that a physical hadron resonance is not just a simple bound state of valence ( anti)quarks , but it should also contain ( anti)quark - meson components . a natural starting point for including such components is the chiral constituent - quark model .",
    "the physical picture behind this model is that the effective degrees of freedom emerging from chiral symmetry breaking of qcd are constituent quarks and goldstone bosons which couple directly to the constituent quarks .",
    "the goldstone bosons can be identified with the lightest pseudoscalar meson octet and singlet . with a linear confinement and the hyperfine interaction being given by the instantaneous approximation to goldstone boson exchange",
    "the chiral constituent - quark model has been very successful in reproducing mass spectra  @xcite and electroweak form factors of light baryons  @xcite .",
    "these calculations ( and also those in refs .",
    "@xcite ) were already done within the framework of relativistic point - form quantum mechanics .",
    "we will now go one step further and take the dynamics of the goldstone - boson exchange fully into account by employing the relativistic coupled channel framework introduced at the beginning of this section .",
    "if we want to study baryon resonances , we have in the first channel 3 quarks and in the second channel 3 quarks plus a goldstone boson .",
    "a physical mass eigenstate is then a superposition of a 3-quark component @xmath92 and a 3-quark plus goldstone - boson component @xmath93 .",

    "classical irreducible fields over minkowski space - time , with a differentiation inner product , are then naturally related to the one - particle wave functions over the four - velocity . as an example , consider a scalar particle with wave function @xmath146 : @xmath147 note that the integration on space - time @xmath148 is over the forward hyperboloid , typical of the point form .    to generate a many - particle theory introduce creation and annihilation operators with the usual commutation relations for fermions ( @xmath149 ) , antifermions ( @xmath150 ) and bosons ( @xmath151 )",
    ". products of bilinears @xmath152 along with products of boson creation and annihilation operators form the algebra of operators @xmath153 , which , acting on the fock vacuum , generates the usual fock space .",

    "it is easily checked that the free four - momentum operator satisfies the point - form equations .    to generate quantum fields for massive particles , it is straightforward to use the mapping between irreps of the poincar group and classical irreducible fields to define ( for example spin 1/2 and 0 ) @xmath157    it is then possible to define the usual free lagrangean and get @xmath158 from the stress energy tensor , @xmath159 as an example , consider the free charged scalar field , @xmath160 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the free four - momentum operator obtained from such a lagrangean is the same as the one obtained from irreps of the poincar group .",
    "the same sort of analysis can be carried out for massless particles .",

    "we will consider only gluon representations , as that is what is relevant for point - form qcd . in that case",
    "the spin space can be chosen to be the four dimensional nonunitary irrep of e(2 ) to get four polarization degrees of freedom ( labeled @xmath162 ) .",
    "the standard four - vector @xmath163 leaves e(2 ) invariant ; a helicity boost , @xmath164 , to a four - momentum @xmath165 then generates a gluon state with transformation properties @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a euclidean wigner `` rotation '' , @xmath168 is an element of the internal symmetry ( color ) group and @xmath169 are color indices .",

    "we next turn to interacting quantum fields and give as an example the self - coupling interaction of gluon fields .",

    "the vacuum problem is to find a state @xmath187 such that it carries a one - dimensional representation of the poincar group and is invariant under internal symmetries : @xmath188 where @xmath168 is an element of the internal symmetry group .",
    "several points can be made about the vacuum : first , it is not possible to add a multiple of the identity operator to @xmath189 without violating point - form equations .",
    "this means the vacuum state can not be shifted to give zero energy and momentum .",
    "second , it suffices to calculate @xmath190 , for invariance under lorentz transformations implies @xmath191 .",
    "finally , writing @xmath192 , generates a set of vacuum equations . for simple one - dimensional models",
    "these vacuum equations can be used to transform away the gluon self - coupling terms ; it is not known whether the same procedure also works for the full space - time vacuum equations  @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of the point form is its explicit lorentz structure .",
    "candidates for the vacuum state are greatly restricted by the condition that they be lorentz scalars .",
    "similarly one - particle states must transform properly under lorentz transformations .",
    "there are simple models where the four - momentum eigenstates can be solved exactly because of this transparent lorentz structure .    to conclude this section we describe the point - form interaction picture and its accompanying covariant perturbation theory .",
    "starting with the relativistic schrdinger equation , write : @xmath193 which is the starting point for covariant perturbation theory ( @xmath194 is a contour in space - time ) .",
    "note that the four - momentum is not conserved for intermediate states ; nor is the four - velocity conserved for intermediate states .",
    "this is to be contrasted with point - form relativistic quantum mechanics , where the four - velocity is conserved .",
    "though point - form relativistic quantum theory is the least explored of the three common forms of relativistic dynamics , it has several properties that make it well suited for applications to hadronic physics .",
    "the most important properties are the kinematic nature of lorentz transformations and the fact that those operators that have interactions ( the energy and momentum operators ) commute with one another .",
    "the kinematic nature of lorentz transformations is particularly important for calculating hadronic form factors . using a coupled channel approach we have constructed hadronic current matrix elements that satisfy lorentz covariance and current conservation .",
    "however , in using a bakamjian - thomas approach , problems involving cluster separability arise ; surprisingly , by taking appropriate limits the point form inspired form factors turn out to be closely related to front form inspired form factors .",
    "further the coupled channel approach has been used to provide more realistic models of hadronic decay processes .",
    "one of the goals of point - form quantum field theory is to analyze point - form qcd . to that end",
    "we have constructed massless gluon fields from irreps of the poincar group and begun investigating model solutions for the gluon self - interactions . in both finite and infinite degree of freedom systems",
    "the goal is to exploit some of the unique features of the point form ."
