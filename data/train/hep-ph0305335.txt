    "understanding nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays is crucial for testing the standard model , and also for uncovering the trace of new physics .",
    "the simplest case is two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays , for which bauer , stech and wirbel ( bsw ) proposed the naive factorization assumption ( fa ) in their pioneering work @xcite .",
    "considerable progress , including generalized fa @xcite and qcd - improved fa ( qcdf ) @xcite , has been made since this proposal . on the other hand , technique to analyze hard exclusive hadronic scattering was developed by brodsky and lepage @xcite based on collinear factorization theorem in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . a modified framework based on @xmath6 factorization theorem",
    "was then given in @xcite , and extended to exclusive @xmath0 meson decays in @xcite .",
    "the infrared finiteness and gauge invariance of @xmath6 factorization theorem was shown explicitly in @xcite .",
    "using this so - called pqcd approach , we have investigated dynamics of nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays @xcite .",
    "our observations are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "fa holds approximately for charmless @xmath0 meson decays , as our computation shows that nonfactorizable contributions are always negligible due to the cancellation between a pair of nonfactorizable diagrams . 2 .",
    "penguin amplitudes are enhanced , as the pqcd formalism includes dynamics from the region , where the energy scale @xmath24 runs to @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the @xmath0 meson and @xmath27 quark mass difference .",
    "annihilation diagrams contribute to large short - distance strong phases through the @xmath28 penguin operators .",
    "4 .   the sign and the magnitude of cp asymmetries in two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays can be calculated , and we have predicted relatively large cp asymmetries in the @xmath29 @xcite and @xmath30 modes@xcite .    all analyses involving strong dynamics suffer large theoretical uncertainties than we would like .",
    "how reliable are these predictions ?",
    "this can be answered only by comparing more of our predictions with experimental data . for this purpose , we study the @xmath31 decays in pqcd , where @xmath32 is a pseudoscalar or a vector meson .",
    "a @xmath33 meson is massive , and the energy release involved in two - body charmed decays is not so large .",
    "if predictions for these decays agree reasonably well with experimental data , pqcd should be more convincing for two - body charmless decays .",
    "since penguin diagrams do not contribute , there are less theoretical ambiguities , such as the argument on chiral enhancement or dynamical enhancement .",
    "checking the validity of pqcd analyses in charmed decays is then more direct .",
    "note that fa is expected to break down for charmed nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays @xcite .",
    "fa holds for charmless decays because of the color transparency argument : contributions from the dominant soft region cancel between the two nonfactorizable diagrams , where the exchanged gluons attach the quark and the antiquark of the light meson emitted from the weak vertex . for charmed decays with the light meson replaced by a @xmath33 meson",
    ", the two nonfactorizable amplitudes do not cancel due to the mass difference between the two constituent quarks of the @xmath33 meson .",
    "hence , nonfactorizable contributions ought to be important .",
    "this observation further leads to the speculation that strong phases in the @xmath31 decays , if there are any , arise from nonfactorizable amplitudes . in charmless",
    "decays , strong phases come from annihilation amplitudes through the @xmath28 penguin operators , since nonfactorizable ones are negligible as explained above .",
    "annihilation amplitudes should not be the source of strong phases for charmed decays , which do not involve the @xmath28 penguin operators .",
    "in this paper we shall apply the pqcd formalism to the two - body charmed decays @xmath31 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "pqcd has predicted the strong phases from annihilation amplitudes for charmless decays , which are consistent with the recently measured cp asymmetries in the @xmath34 modes .",
    "it is then interesting to examine whether pqcd also gives the correct magnitude and strong phases from nonfactorizable amplitudes implied by the isospin relation of the @xmath31 decays .",
    "compared to the work in @xcite , the contributions from the twist-3 light meson distribution amplitudes and the threshold resummation effect have been taken into account , and more modes analyzed .",
    "the power counting rules for charmed @xmath0 meson decays , constructed in @xcite , are employed to obtain the leading factorization formulas .",
    "it will be shown that nonfactorizable contributions to charmed decays are calculable in pqcd , and play an important role in explaining the isospin relation indicated by experimental data .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath35 , @xmath17 branching ratios can be confronted with future measurement .    in sec .",
    "ii we review the progresses on the study of two - body charmed nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays in the literature .",
    "the pqcd analysis of the above decays is presented in sec .",
    "iii by taking the @xmath11 modes as an example .",
    "numerical results for all the @xmath31 branching ratios , and for the extracted bsw parameters @xmath15 and @xmath14 are collected in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we compare the pqcd approach to exclusive @xmath0 meson decays with others in the literature .",
    "vi is the conclusion .",
    "appendix a contains the explicit expressions of the factorization formulas .",
    "to develop the pqcd formalism for charmed @xmath0 meson decays , we have investigated the @xmath36 transition form factors in the large recoil region of the @xmath33 meson @xcite .",
    "we briefly review this formalism , which serves as the basis of the @xmath31 analysis .",
    "the @xmath36 transition is more complicated than the @xmath37 one , because it involves three scales : the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath38 , the @xmath33 meson mass @xmath39 , and the heavy meson and heavy quark mass difference , @xmath40 of order of the qcd scale @xmath41 , @xmath39 ( @xmath42 ) being the @xmath33 meson ( @xmath43 quark ) mass .",
    "we have postulated the hierachy of the three scales , @xmath44 which allows a consistent power expansion in @xmath45 and in @xmath46 .",
    "write the @xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) meson momentum @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) in the light - cone coordinates as @xmath49 the picture associated with the @xmath36 transition is shown in fig .  [ leading ] , where the initial state is approximated by the @xmath50 component .",
    "the @xmath27 quark decays into a @xmath43 quark and a virtual @xmath51 boson , which carries the momentum @xmath52 .",
    "since the constituents are roughly on the mass shell , we have the invariant masses @xmath53 , @xmath54 and 2 , where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the momentum of the spectator @xmath57 quark in the @xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) meson .",
    "the above kinematic constraints lead to the order of magnitude of @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite , @xmath58    the lowest - order diagrams contributing to the @xmath36 form factors contain a hard gluon exchange between the @xmath27 or @xmath43 quark and the @xmath57 quark as shown in fig .",
    "[ gluon ] .",

    "( [ hie ] ) , we have @xmath60 , and the hard kernels are calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "it has been found that the applicability of pqcd to the @xmath36 transition at large recoil is marginal for the physical masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "infrared divergences arise from higher - order corrections to fig .",
    "[ gluon ] .",
    "the soft ( collinear ) type of divergences is absorbed into the @xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) meson wave function @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , which is not calculable but universal .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is conjugate to the transverse momentum @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) carried by the @xmath57 quark in the @xmath0 ( @xmath33 ) meson .",
    "it has been shown , from equations of motion for the relevant nonlocal matrix elements , that @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) has a peak at the momentum fraction @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) @xcite .",
    "the form factors are then expressed as the convolution of the hard kernels @xmath69 with the @xmath0 and @xmath33 meson wave functions in @xmath6 factorization theorem , @xmath70 the @xmath33 meson wave function contains a sudakov factor arising from @xmath6 resummation , which sums the large double logarithms @xmath71 to all orders .",
    "the @xmath0 meson wave function also contains such a sudakov factor , whose effect is negligible because a @xmath0 meson is dominated by soft dynamics .",
    "the hard kernels involve a sudakov factor from threshold resummation , which sums the large double logarithm @xmath72 or @xmath73 to all orders .",
    "this factor modifies the end - point behavior of the @xmath0 and @xmath33 meson wave functions effectively , rendering them diminish faster in the small @xmath74 region .",
    "it has been pointed out that if evaluating fig .",
    "[ gluon ] in collinear factorization theorem , an end - point singularity appears @xcite . in this theorem",
    "we have the lowest - order hard kernel , @xmath75 from the left diagram in fig .",
    "[ gluon ] , which leads to a logarithmic divergence , as the @xmath33 meson distribution amplitude behaves like @xmath76 in the small @xmath77 region .",
    "this singularity implies the breakdown of collinear factorization , and @xmath6 factorization becomes more appropriate .",
    "once the parton transverse momenta @xmath6 are taken into account , eq .",
    "( [ hco ] ) is modified into @xmath78 [ x_2m_b^2+{\\bf k}_{2t}^2]}\\;. \\label{hkt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a dynamical effect , the so - called sudakov suppression , favors the configuration in which @xmath6 is not small @xcite .",
    "the end - point singularity then disappears as explained below .",
    "when an electron undergoes harder scattering , it intends to radiate more photons .",
    "hence , the scattering amplitude for radiating no photons must be suppressed by a factor , whose effect increases with the electron energy . in qed it is the well - known sudakov suppression factor , an amplitude for an electron not to emit a photon in hard scattering . in the current qcd case of the @xmath36 transition ,",
    "it is the @xmath43-@xmath57 quark - antiquark color dipole that undergoes hard scattering . when the color dipole is larger , in intends to radiate more gluons .",
    "since the final state contains only a single @xmath33 meson , the real gluon emission is forbidden in the hard decay process .",
    "similarly , the transition amplitude must involve a sudakov factor , whose effect increases with the size of the color dipole , i.e. , with the separation @xmath27 between @xmath43 and @xmath57 .",
    "that is , the configuration with a smaller separation @xmath27 or with a larger relative transverse momentum @xmath6 is preferred in the @xmath79 transition at large recoil .",
    "then the virtual particles involved in the hard kernel remain sufficiently off - shell , and eq .  ( [ bds ] ) , with eq .",
    "( [ hkt ] ) inserted , is free from the end - point singularity .",
    "the corresponding sudakov factor can be derived in pqcd as a function of the transverse separation @xmath27 and of the momentum fraction @xmath80 carried by the spectator quark @xcite , whose behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ sudakov ] .",
    "the sudakov factor suppresses the large @xmath27 region , where the quark and the antiquark are separated by a large transverse distance and the color shielding is not effective .",
    "it also suppresses the @xmath81 region , where a quark carries all of the meson momentum , and intends to emit real gluons in hard scattering .",
    "the sudakov factors from @xmath6 resummation @xcite for the @xmath0 and @xmath33 mesons are only associated with the light spectator quarks , since the double logarithms arise from the overlap of the soft and mass ( collinear ) divergences .",
    "these factors , being universal , are the same as in all our previous analyses .    similarly , the small @xmath80 region corresponds to a configuration with a soft spectator , i.e. , with a large color dipole in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the probability for this large color dipole not to radiate in hard scattering is also described by a sudakov factor , which comes from threshold resummation for the hard kernels . for the derivation of this sudakov factor ,",

    "the above parametrization is motivated by the qualitative behavior of @xmath84 : @xmath85 as @xmath86 , 1 @xcite .",
    "since threshold resummation is associated with the hard kernels , the result could be process - dependent .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that its effect is essential for factorizable decay topologies , and negligible for nonfactorizable decay topologies .",

    "this is the reason fa was claimed to work well in explaining two - body charmed @xmath0 meson decays , before the class-2 modes @xmath123 with @xmath124 , and @xmath4 were measured .    the recently observed @xmath123 branching ratios listed in table  [ dpda ] @xcite revealed interesting qcd dynamics .",

    "these results can be regarded as a failure of fa : the parameters @xmath14 in different types of decays , such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 , differ by almost a factor 2 in magnitude , implying strong nonuniversal nonfactorizable effects .",

    "the @xmath241 branching ratio is larger than the @xmath242 one due to the constructive inteference between the color - suppressed contribution and the annihilation contribution as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ dom ] ) . to obtain the @xmath243 helicity amplitudes and their relative phases @xcite , the power - suppressed contributions from the transverse polarizations must be included . for consistency , the contribution from the longitudinal polarization",

    "we shall study this subject in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath35 , @xmath17 decays can be compared with future measurement .",

    "in this section we make a brief comparison of the pqcd formalism with other qcd approaches to exclusive @xmath0 meson decays , emphasizing the differences . for more details , refer to @xcite . as mentioned before , there are two kinds of factorization theorem for qcd processes @xcite : collinear factorization , on which the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , lcsr @xcite , and qcdf @xcite are based , and @xmath6 factorization , on which the pqcd approach is based . calculating the @xmath37 form factor @xmath100 in collinear factorization up to leading power in @xmath167 and leading - order in @xmath145 ,",
    "an end - point singularity occurs .",
    "hence , we define three types of contributions : a genuine soft contribution @xmath246 , a contribution @xmath247 containing the end - point singularity , and a finite contribution @xmath248 : @xmath249 the second term can not cover the complete soft contribution , because it is from a leading formalism .",
    "note that the end - point singularity exists even in the heavy quark limit .",
    "hence , @xmath0 meson decays differ from other exclusive processes , which become calculable in collinear factorization at sufficiently large momentum transfer .",
    "there are two options to handle the above end - point singularity @xcite : first , an end - point singularity in collinear factorization implies that exclusive @xmath0 meson decays are dominated by soft dynamics .",
    "therefore , a heavy - to - light form factor is not calculable , and @xmath250 should be treated as a soft object , like @xmath246 . in scet and qcdf ,",
    "@xmath100 is then written , up to @xmath251 , as @xcite @xmath252 with @xmath253 the soft form factor @xmath254 , obeying the large - energy symmetry relations @xcite , can be estimated in terms of a triangle diagram without a hard gluon exchange in lcsr @xcite .",
    "however , since the pion vertex has been replaced by the pion distribution amplitudes under twist expansion , what is calculated in lcsr is not the full soft contribution .",
    "the term @xmath255 has been expressed as a convolution of the hard - scattering kernel @xmath256 with the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath0 meson and of the pion in the momentum fractions , implying that it is calculable in collinear factorization .",
    "the second option is that an end - point singularity indicates the breakdown of the collinear factorization .",
    "hence , the @xmath6 factorization is the more appropriate framework , in which the parton transverse momenta @xmath6 are retained in the hard kernel , and @xmath250 does not develop an end - point singularity .",
    "both @xmath250 and @xmath248 are then calculable , and expressed , in the pqcd approach , as @xmath257 where the symbol @xmath258 represents the convolution not only in the momentum fractions , but in the transverse separations .",
    "the hard kernel @xmath256 in eq .",
    "( [ fff ] ) is derived from the complete hard kernel @xmath259 by dropping the terms which lead to the end - point singularity in the collinear factorization .",
    "certainly , the subtraction of these terms depends on a regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "the strong sudakov suppression in the soft parton region implies that the genuine soft contribution @xmath246 is not important @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ hd ] ) is then claimed to be a consequence of the hard - dominance picture , because a big portion of @xmath100 is calculable .",
    "the agreement between the sum - rule and pqcd predictions for many @xmath0 meson transition form factors justifies that @xmath246 is indeed negligible . since @xmath250 remains in eq .",
    "( [ hd ] ) , the form factor symmetry relations at large recoil are still respected in the pqcd framework @xcite , which are then modified by the subleading term @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , the soft - dominance ( hard - dominance ) picture postulated in lcsr ( pqcd ) makes sense in the collinear ( @xmath6 ) factorization @xcite .",
    "the two pictures arise from the different theoretical frameworks , and there is no conflict at all .",
    "in other words , the soft contribution refers to @xmath254 in scet , lcsr , and qcdf , which is large , but to @xmath246 in pqcd , which is small .",
    "lcsr can be regarded as a method to evaluate @xmath250 or @xmath254 in the collinear factorization ( at least the light - cone distribution amplitudes have been employed on the pion side ) , while the @xmath6 factorization is adopted in pqcd for the evaluation of @xmath250 .",
    "we emphasize that there is no preference between the two options for semileptonic @xmath0 meson decays , both of which give similar results as stated above .",
    "however , in their extension to two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays , predictions could be very different .",
    "for example , the main source of strong phases in the @xmath155 decays is the correction to the weak vertex in qcdf , but the annihilation diagram in pqcd .",
    "this is the reason qcdf ( pqcd ) predicts a smaller and positive ( larger and negative ) cp asymmetry @xmath260 @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to discriminate experimentally which theoretical framework works better .",
    "next we compare our formalism for two - body charmed nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays based on the @xmath6 factorization with scet and qcdf based on the collinear factorization .",
    "currently , lcsr has not yet been applied to the nonfactorizable contribution discussed here , but only to that from three - parton distribution amplitudes @xcite , since the former , involving two loops , is more complicated to analyze .",
    "similarly , the neglect of @xmath6 results in end - point singularities in the factorizable contributions @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which need to be parametrized in terms of the @xmath165 and @xmath37 transition form factors , respectively",
    ". it also causes an end - point singularity in the color - suppressed nonfactorizable amplitude @xmath143 , if the @xmath43 quark is treated as being massive .",
    "this is why the color - suppressed modes , i.e. , the magnitude and the phase of @xmath14 , can not be predicted in qcdf , and the proof of qcdf in the scet formalism @xcite considered only the color - allowed mode @xmath261 .",
    "the color - allowed nonfactorizable amplitude @xmath142 is calculable in qcdf , because the end - point singularities cancel between the pair of diagrams , figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) .",
    "we mention a recent work on scet @xcite , in which the color - suppressed nonfactorizable amplitude has been parametrized as an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ soh ] ) .    if the @xmath43 quark is treated as being massless , the end - point singularities in the pair of color - suppressed nonfactorizable diagrams , figs .",
    "5(c ) and 5(d ) , will cancel each other as in the charmless case @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by examining the behavior of the integrand of @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ md ] ) in the dominant region with small @xmath169 , noticing that the @xmath164 meson distribution amplitude @xmath214 would be symmetric under the exchange of @xmath77 and @xmath215 in the @xmath262 limit .",
    "however , the nonfactorizable contribution will become negligible in this limit , such that the amplitude @xmath216 , though calculable in qcdf , is not large enough to explain the @xmath11 data .",
    "it is then obvious that the pqcd approach has made a great contribution here : the nonfactorizable corrections to the naive factorizations of both the color - allowed and color - suppressed modes can be predicted , and the latter is found to be very important .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the two - body charmed nonleptonic decays @xmath31 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in the pqcd approach .",
    "this framework is based on @xmath6 factorization theorem , which is free of end - point singularities and gauge - invariant .",
    "@xmath6 factorization theorem is more appropriate , when the end - point region of a momentum fraction is important , and collnear factorization theorem breaks down . by including the transverse degrees of freedom of partons in the evaluation of a hard kernel , and the sudakov factors from @xmath6 and threshold resummations , the virtual particles remain sufficiently off - shell , and",
    "the end - point singularities do not exist .",
    "we have explained that there is no conflict between lcsr with the soft - dominance picture and pqcd with the hard - dominance picture , since the soft contributions refer to the different quantities in the two theoretical frameworks .",
    "the derivation of the factorization formulas for the @xmath5 decay amplitudes follow the power counting rules constructed in our previous work on the @xmath36 transition form factors . under the hierachy @xmath263 , the @xmath0 and @xmath33 meson wave functions exhibit a peak at the momentum fractions around @xmath157 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "up to leading power in @xmath45 and in @xmath46 , only a single @xmath0 meson wave function and a single @xmath33 meson wave function are involved .",
    "the factorization formulas then become simpler than those for the charmless decays .",
    "moreover , the factorization formulas for all the @xmath31 modes are identical , except the appropriate substitution of the masses , the decay constants , and the meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "we emphasize that there is no arbitrary parameter in our analysis ( there are in qcdf ) , though all universal inputs are not yet known precisely .",
    "the meson wave functions have been determined either from the semileptonic data or from lcsr .",
    "being free from the end - point singularities , all topologies of decay amplitudes are calculable in pqcd , including the color - suppressed nonfactorizable one .",
    "this amplitude can not be computed in qcdf based on the collinear factorization theorem due to the existence of the end - point singularities for a massive @xmath43 quark .",
    "we have observed in pqcd that this amplitude , not suppressed by the wilson coefficient ( proportional to @xmath264 ) , is comparable to the dominant color - allowed factorizable amplitude .",
    "it generates a large strong phase from the non - pinched singularity of the hard kernel , which is crucial for explaining the observed @xmath5 branching ratios .",
    "the other topologies are less important : the color - allowed nonfactorizable contribution is negligible because of the pair cancellation and the small wilson coefficient @xmath213 .",
    "the color - suppressed factorizable amplitude with the small wilson coefficient @xmath265 is also negligible .",
    "the annihilation amplitudes are small , since they come from the tree operators .",
    "all our predictions are consistent with the existing measurements . for those without data , such as the @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath17 modes , our predictions can be confronted with future measurement . as stated before ,",
    "we have predicted the large strong phases from the scalar - penguin annihilation amplitudes , which are required by the large cp asymmetries observed in two - body charmless decays .",
    "the success in predicting the storng phases from the color - suppressed nonfactorizable amplitudes for the two - body charmed decays further supports the @xmath6 factorization theorem .",
