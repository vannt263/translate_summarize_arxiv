    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) are simple one - dimensional driven lattice gases with hard core exclusion .",
    "they were originally introduced in the context of protein synthesis @xcite and have attracted much interest during the last years as simple models for boundary - induced phase transitions @xcite , for which many rigorous results have been obtained @xcite . in the open system ,",
    "different stationary states are found , which depend on the rates of injection and extraction of particles at the ends .",
    "varying the injection and extraction rates , or equivalently the densities at the left and right boundary , both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions are observed .",
    "the actual stationary state is selected via the dynamics of domain walls and density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "promising candidates for the experimental observation of these phase transitions are systems of cytoskeletal motors which move unidirectionally along cytoskeletal filaments @xcite . however , these motors unbind from their track after a few seconds , since their binding energy can be overcome by thermal fluctuations .",
    "observed over sufficiently long times which exceed a few seconds , they alternate between the bound and the unbound state and perform peculiar random walks . if a motor is bound to a filament , it moves in a directed way along the filament , while unbound motors diffuse freely .",
    "as motors are strongly attracted by the filament , the motor density along the filament can be large even if the overall motor concentration is rather small , which implies that hard core exclusion plays an important role in the bound state . to study these combined movements ,",
    "we have recently introduced a class of lattice models where bound and unbound motor movements are described as biased and symmetric random walks on a lattice , respectively @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the traffic of motors along a filament is an asymmetric simple exclusion process with the additional property that motors can attach to and detach from the track",
    ".    for open tube systems with a single filament and fixed motor concentrations at the tube ends , the same types of phases are found as for the usual one - dimensional asep @xcite .",
    "if the filament is shorter than the tube and motors have to diffuse over a certain distance to reach one end of the filament from the left boundary and again to reach the right boundary from the other end of the filament , the phase boundaries of the system can be shifted by changing geometrical tube parameters or motor parameters .",
    "in particular , a maximal current phase , in which the current attains its maximally possible value , can only be found if the diffusive currents from the left end of the tube to the filament and from the filament to the right end of the tube can be as large as this maximal current .",
    "these diffusive currents however are restricted by the diffusion coefficient of the unbound motors and by geometric parameters @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon is generic and not restricted to the specific tube geometry . in the following , we study several one - dimensional systems which consist of compartments characterized by active or diffusive transport .",
    "we will discuss four simple geometries as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] .",
    "while particles move only to the right in the active compartments , forward and backward steps occur with the same probability in the diffusive compartments . for these models ,",
    "we determine the phase diagram analytically using a mean field approach to calculate effective boundary densities or effective injection and extraction rates for the active compartments .",
    "the method is based on the constraint that the stationary current must be equal in all compartments .",
    "the article is organized as follows . after introducing the model in section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "we discuss _ diffusive injection and extraction _ of particles into / from an active compartment in section [ sec : diffinjextr ] .",
    "we start with only diffusive injection in section [ sec : diff_inj ] which corresponds to case ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] , proceed with only diffusive extraction in section [ sec : diff_extr ] , see case ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] , and then study the case ( c ) , for which particles are both injected and extracted via diffusive compartments , see section [ sec : diff_inj&extr ] .",
    "we compare the mean field results with monte carlo simulation in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the case of a _ diffusive compartment between two active compartments _ as shown as case ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] in section [ sec : cased ] .",
    "this case corresponds to a defect that must be overcome by unbiased diffusion .",
    "in the following , we will discuss transport on one - dimensional lattices . the coordinate along the lattice is denoted by @xmath0 and will be measured in units of the lattice constant @xmath1 .",
    "we consider systems that can be decomposed into two or three different compartments in which transport is either diffusive or directed .",
    "the four cases that will be discussed in the following are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] .",
    "the total length of the system is taken to be @xmath2 in all cases .",
    "the linear extensions of the compartments are denoted by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : bildchen_asep_diff_inj_extr ] . in case ( a )",
    ", the system consists of a left compartment with @xmath6 , where transport is diffusive , and a right compartment with @xmath7 , where transport is active or directed . in case",
    "( b ) , transport is directed in the left compartment and diffusive in the right compartment . the cases ( c ) and",
    "( d ) correspond to situations where the systems consist of three compartments with @xmath8 . in case ( c ) ,",
    "transport is driven in the middle compartment with @xmath9 and diffusive in the left and right ones .",
    "finally in case ( d ) , transport is directed in two compartments , the left and the right one , but diffusive in the middle compartment . in all cases",
    ", we will assume that the extensions of the active compartments are sufficiently large , so that we can neglect finite - size effects .    in the following",
    ", we will take the active transport to be always directed to the right and to be totally asymmetric , i.e. , we do not allow backward steps in the compartments with active transport . at lattice sites which belong to such an active compartment",
    ", particles attempt to hop to the adjacent lattice site to their right with a certain probability per unit time @xmath10 .",
    "we denote this probability by @xmath11 since it is equal to the velocity of a particle in the active compartment ( and in the absence of other particles ) , measured in units of @xmath12 .",
    "the hopping attempt is rejected if the target site is already occupied by another particle . in summary , motion in the active compartment is described by a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "in contrast , motion in the diffusive compartments is described by a symmetric exclusion process . a particle at a lattice site which belongs to a diffusive compartment attempts to make a forward and a backward step with equal probability @xmath13 , which corresponds to the diffusion coefficient measured in units of @xmath14 .",
    "note that we could eliminate one parameter by measuring time in units of the time scale for diffusive steps of size @xmath1 by choosing @xmath15 ( for this choice , the diffusion coefficient measured in units of @xmath14 would be given by @xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that the results which we derive in the following will depend only on the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "all hopping attempts in the diffusive compartments are again rejected if the target site is occupied by another particle . in order to simplify the following calculations , we do not allow particles to enter the active compartments from the right , i.e.  all hopping attempts from the first site of a diffusive compartment to the last site of the active compartment to its right  from @xmath18 to @xmath3 in case ( b ) and ( d ) and from @xmath19 to @xmath20 in case ( c )  are rejected .    finally , the densities at the boundary sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 have the fixed values @xmath23 these sites are taken to have the same dynamics as the adjacent compartments of the system .",
    "particles thus attempt to enter the system from the left with probability @xmath24 if the first compartment is diffusive and with probability @xmath25 if it is an active compartment",
    ". particles at the last lattice site with @xmath26 leave the system to the right with probability @xmath27 if the site @xmath26 belongs to an active compartment and with probability @xmath28 if it belongs to a diffusive one . in the latter case , particles also try to enter the system from the right at @xmath26 with probability @xmath29 .",
    "likewise , particles at site @xmath30 can leave the system with probability @xmath31 if @xmath30 belongs to a diffusive compartment . as before",
    ", particles can only enter the system at @xmath30 or @xmath26 if these sites are not occupied .",
    "in this section , we consider the cases ( a)(c ) , where transport is driven or active in one compartment , but particles are diffusively injected and/or extracted from the system and have to diffuse over a certain distance before they reach the active compartment and/or before they can leave the system at the right end .",
    "as mentioned before , the active compartment is described by an asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "let us therefore briefly summarize what is known about the phase diagram of this process , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . in an open system , where the densities are fixed to @xmath32 and @xmath33 at the left and right boundary of the asep ,",
    "respectively , the stationary state is determined by the boundary densities .",
    "the stationary states are characterized by the bulk density @xmath34 and the stationary current @xmath35 .    for the asep with open boundaries",
    ", three different phases can be distinguished as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasendiag_normasep ] : if the density at the left boundary is relatively small and satisfies @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the system is in the low density phase ( ld ) for which the bulk density is equal to the left boundary density and the current is @xmath38 .",
    "if the density at the right boundary is relatively large with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the system is in the high density phase ( hd ) , the bulk density is equal to the right boundary density , and the current is @xmath41 . at the transition from the low density to the high density phase ,",
    "the current is continuous , but the bulk density is discontinuous . finally , for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the system is in the maximal current phase , where the current is maximal , @xmath44 and the bulk density is @xmath45 .",
    "the transitions to the maximal current phase are continuous .",
    "in contrast to the simple aseps just described , our systems are characterized by the property that at least one of the boundary densities of the active compartments is not fixed , but adjusted by the dynamics of the system . in the following , we will determine the phase diagrams of these systems using a mean field approach .",
    "we proceed in three steps and consider first diffusive injection and extraction of particles separately , combining them in the last step .",
    "first we consider case ( a ) , a system with only diffusive injection of particles .",
    "particles leave the system at the right boundary with rate @xmath46 and no particles enter the system at the right end . in the stationary state , the current @xmath35 must be the same in both compartments . in the left compartment with @xmath47 where transport is diffusive , the density",
    "is then given by @xmath48 .",
    "within mean field approximation , the right compartment with @xmath49 , corresponds to the usual asep with the effective left boundary density @xmath50 as follows from @xmath51 .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 corresponds to the rate with which particles attempt to enter the asep at its left boundary . note that ( i ) this effective boundary density depends on the current @xmath35 and ( ii ) that @xmath53 can be larger than one .",
    "the right boundary density is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the phase diagram can now be determined in a self - consistent way . as in the tube system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same phases are found as for the one - dimensional asep , but the location of the transition lines depends on the values of the model parameters @xmath17 and @xmath3 , and the maximal current phase may be shifted out of the physically accessible range of the parameters .",
    "the system is in the maximal current phase if @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in this case",
    "the current is @xmath44 , and the condition @xmath56 implies that the system is in the maximal current phase for @xmath57 for large @xmath17 , the latter value of the left boudary density is larger than one and therefore not physically accessible .",
    "this implies that a maximal current phase is only present for small velocities with @xmath58 .",
    "if the velocity is larger , unphysically high densities would be necessary at the left boundary in order to establish a sufficiently large density gradient which could generate a diffusive current with the value @xmath59 , the maximal current defined by the driven compartment .",
    "in this situation , the diffusive compartments acts as a diffusive bottleneck : if the maximally possible diffusive current through the diffusive compartment is smaller than @xmath59 , a maximal current phase can not occur , because the diffusive compartment can not maintain the maximal current .    a simpler estimate comparing the maximal diffusive current @xmath60 , which is restricted by the maximal density difference of one , with the maximal driven current @xmath59 yields the condition , @xmath61 , which agrees with the previous one for large @xmath3 , but is less restrictive for small @xmath3 .",
    "the latter discrepancy reflects the fact that the maximal density difference in the diffusive compartment is actually smaller than one since the density at @xmath62 must be larger than zero .",
    "in addition , a low density phase is found for @xmath63 and @xmath64 and a high density phase for @xmath65 and @xmath66 . along the transition line between the high density and low density phases we can use @xmath67 and obtain @xmath68\\ ] ] for the transition line between the low density and the high density phase .",
    "this line extends from the right upper corner of the phase diagram to the right upper corner of the maximal current phase region .",
    "if there is no maximal current phase , it ends at a point with @xmath69 and @xmath66 .",
    "phase diagrams for two cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasendiag_diff_inj ] . we have chosen @xmath70 and @xmath16 in both cases .",
    "the condition for the presence of a maximal current phase is then @xmath71 . in fig .",

    "[ fig : phasendiag_diff_inj](b ) , @xmath73 and the maximal current phase is absent . in the latter case",
    "the largest part of the phase diagram is covered by the low density phase .    in the maximal current phase the current is @xmath44 . in the high density phase",
    ", it is determined by the right boundary density @xmath74 and has the value @xmath67 .",
    "finally in the low density phase , the current is given by the self - consistency condition @xmath75,\\ ] ] which leads to a quadratic equation for the current .",
    "the solutions is uniquely determined by the limits @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath44 for @xmath78 and is given by @xmath79      next we consider case ( b ) , in which particles which reach the end of the active compartment have to diffuse over a distance @xmath4 before they can leave the system at the right end .",
    "this case can be treated in the same way as the one with diffusive injection .",
    "note , however , that it can not simply be derived from the the latter one using particle - hole symmetry , because a particle at the site left of the driven compartment attempts to enter it with rate @xmath13 , while a hole at the site right of the driven compartment does so with rate @xmath11 .    the density profile in the diffusive compartment is given by @xmath80 for @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the effective rate with which particles attempt to leave the active compartment at @xmath62 is @xmath81 corresponding to an effective right boundary density of the driven compartment given by @xmath82    the maximal current phase is now found for @xmath42 and @xmath83 which is always @xmath84 . again the maximal current phase is only present if the range of boundary densities defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcbeidiffextr ] ) is physically accessible . here",
    "the corresponding condition is @xmath85 , which is valid for @xmath86 .",
    "the latter condition expresses again the fact that the diffusive compartment must also support this maximal current .",
    "the diffusive current is , however , restricted by the maximally possible value of the density gradient in the right ( diffusive ) compartment , @xmath87 , which leads to a maximal diffusive current of @xmath88 .",

    "transport is now driven in the middle compartment for which we have the effective boundary densities @xmath97 the phase boundary between the low density phase and the maximal current phase is not affected by adding another compartment at the right end , thus we can use the result from case ( a ) . likewise the phase boundary between the high density phase and the maximal current phase is unaffected by the left diffusive compartment , so that we can use the result from case ( b ) upon substituting @xmath4 with @xmath5 . the maximal current phase is therefore found for @xmath98 it is present if @xmath58 and @xmath99 .",

    "the mean field results ( lines ) and the simulation data ( symbols ) agree well .    if a maximal current phase is present , i.e.  for small velocities , the agreement is less good , although the phase diagram is still in qualitative agreement with the mean field predictions .",
    "[ fig : strom_dichte_v.1b6 ] shows again results for the case @xmath104 .",
    "close to the transition to the maximal current phase the current is smaller than predicted by the mean field calculation .",
    "therefore the transition to the maximal current phase is shifted towards a larger value of @xmath32 and the increase of the bulk density near the transition is less steep . far from the transition , however , agreement is again good .",
    "likewise , the transition line between the low density and the high density phase is also shifted towards larger @xmath32 , as this transition line ends on the phase boundary of the maximal current phase .",
    "agreement becomes again better far from the maximal current phase , since the other end point of the line ( @xmath77 , @xmath107 ) is exact .",
    "finally , let us consider case ( d ) , where active transport is interrupted by a diffusive compartment . in the case of molecular motors , this can be realized by a gap in the filament network , along which active transport takes place .",

    ", we observe the usual maximal current phase for @xmath161 in the simulations while the mean field approach yields @xmath162 .",
    "finally , let us add a remark concerning the density profiles in the hd  ld phase . from our mean field approach ,",
    "we expect the constant bulk densities in the left and right active compartments to be approached exponentially from the left and right boundary , respectively .",
    "this is the case in the simulation data ; however , in addition , an excess density close to the diffusive compartment is observed , which is not expected from the mean field approach , see fig .",
    "[ fig : profilhdld ] . as reported previously for the case of an asep with a single defect site @xcite , this excess density decays as a power - law @xmath163 , so that some kind of long - range order is also present in this phase which plays the role of a maximal current phase for the system with a diffusive bottleneck .",
    "we have discussed transport in one - dimensional lattices which consist of two or three compartments where transport is either driven or diffusive , a situation that is inspired by the motion of molecular motors which diffuse until they reach a filament and then move along that filament in a directed manner @xcite .",
    "mutual exclusion from lattice sites is important , as many particles can be injected into the system from reservoirs of fixed density at both ends .",
    "this is again realistic for molecular motors , which are strongly attracted by the filaments , so that the density of motors along the filaments can become large , even if the motor concentration in solution is relatively small .",
    "traffic in the compartments where transport is active or driven is described by an asymmetric simple exclusion process .",
    "we have studied four different geometries . in the cases ( a)(c ) , particles are injected into an active compartment and/or extracted from it via diffusive compartments . in case ( d ) , active transport is interrupted by a diffusive compartment in the middle .",
    "the latter case is a generalization of the asep with a point defect .    in all cases",
    ", the diffusive compartments can act as diffusive bottlenecks .",
    "if the velocity of the particles in the driven compartment is sufficiently small , the phase diagram is essentially the same as for the usual one - dimensional asep . in the cases ( a)(c ) , the locations of the transition lines depend on the model parameters . for large velocities , on the other hand , transport through the lattice",
    "is limited by the diffusive compartments which can not support arbitrarily large currents . in the cases ( a)(c )",
    ", this situation implies the absence of the maximal current phase .",
    "in contrast , in case ( d ) , this leads to a peculiar new phase , the hd  ld phase , where the density is high in the left , but low in the right active compartment . as in a maximal current phase ,",
    "the current is constant in the hd  ld phase and has the maximal possible value .",
    "in contrast to the usual maximal current phase , this value of the currrent is determined by the diffusive compartment , and the transitions to the hd  ld phase are continuous in one , but discontinuous in the other active compartment .                            , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the total length of the system is given by @xmath164 in cases ( a ) and ( b ) and by @xmath8 in cases ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in the active compartments , motion is completely biased and particles hop to the right with probability @xmath11 , while in the diffusive compartments , particles hop both to the left and to the right with probability @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we do not allow particles to enter the active compartments from the right .",
    "the densities at the boundary sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fixed to @xmath165 and @xmath33 , respectively . ]"
