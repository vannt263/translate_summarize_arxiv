    "quantum hall edge states at integer filling factors @xcite present a notable example of a strongly interacting quasi - one - dimensional system . typically , in such systems interactions can not be considered perturbatively , and the associated physical phenomena do not have any analogues in weakly interacting systems .",
    "for example , at filling factor @xmath0 the coulomb interaction between the two copropagating chiral electron channels at the edge of a qh system splits the spectrum of the collective excitations into one dipole and one charged mode , that propagate with different velocities . @xcite as a result , at relatively long length scales , where these two excitations are well separated in space , this leads to strong correlations between electrons .",
    "new interesting mesoscopic phenomena that arise from this correlations have recently been the subject of experimental studies and intensive theoretical discussions . in the context of the present paper we would like to mention the observation of the lobes @xcite and of the shot noise - induced phase transition @xcite in the visibility of aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations in electronic mz interferometers , and the experimental studies of relaxation of non - equilibrium electron distribution functions .",
    "@xcite    the essential ingredient of all mentioned above experiments is that a strongly non - equilibrium state is created by applying a voltage bias to a quantum point contact ( qpc ) and injecting a current of electrons into one of the two electron channels .",
    "the use of this technique has a crucial effect on the subsequent evolution of the propagating state , most prominent example being the mentioned above phase transition when the qpc s transparency is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "very recently , the group of patrice roche has implemented an alternative approach , @xcite where a single - electron wave packet is injected into one of the edge channels by using resonant tunnelling via a single energy level in a quantum dot ( qd ) ( see fig .  [ inter ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this approach was to reduce the effects of the partition noise of the first qpc , and of the energy averaging in the initial state due to the applied voltage bias , and thus to focus solely on the effects of interaction in the created state .",
    "these effects have been probed with the help of the mz interferometer attached to the system downstream of the injection point , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ inter ] .",
    "one of the puzzling results of this experiment , outlined below , has motivated our present work .    ,",
    "connected by two tunnel junctions with coupling amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a quantum dot with charging energy @xmath4 is attached to one of the channels of the qh edge by the tunnel junction with the coupling amplitude @xmath5.,width=302 ]    [ inter ]    the experimentalists have investigated the dependence of the visibility of the ab oscillation in the mz interferometer on the energy of the injected electron wave packet .",
    "typically , the phase coherence reduces gradually at high energies , because this increases the possibility for electrons to scatter inelastically .",
    "surprisingly , the paper [ ] has reported an initial suppression of the visibility starting from zero energy , which is , however , followed by its saturation at the value 0.12 at energy around 25 @xmath6 and by a long plateau up to energies of 120 @xmath6 .",
    "the authors have argued that a possible explanation of this unexpected behaviour should account for the fact that strong interactions lead to the relaxation of energy of the initial electron state .",
    "when such a state arrives to the interferometer , regardless of the energy of the initial state , it can not scatter inelastically anymore , which may explain the plateau in the visibility of the ab oscillations .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to investigate whether the simple model of strongly interacting qh edge states at filling factor @xmath0 , proposed earlier in ref .  [ ] and proved to be essential to explain the recent experiments mentioned above , is also capable of explaining the experiment in ref .",
    "[ ] . according to this model , the chiral character of the electron transport at the qh edge allows one to apply the free - fermionic approach to the derivation of the initial state of the injected electron wave packet , followed by the use of the bosonization technique @xcite to describe its subsequent evolution , and to account for the interactions non - perturbatively .",
    "we examine the splitting of the state at the qpcs of the mz interferometer and evaluate the average current and the visibility of the ab oscillations using the tunnelling hamiltonian approach to the lowest order in tunnelling .",
    "finally , we come to the conclusion that by using this approach , one is not able to explain the plateau in the visibility , observed in the experiment [ ] , i.e. , some additional physical ingredients have to be considered , such as , perhaps , effects of disorder and/or of the non - linear dispersion , that are not included in our model . instead , we find that the visibility as a function of the energy of the initial state , oscillates and decays in a power - law manner .",
    "our results can be interpreted in two alternative ways .",
    "on one hand , despite the strong interactions , a chiral quasi - one - dimensional system of electrons remains an integrable system in terms of collective bosonic charge excitations .",
    "in other words , in the case of linear dispersion law for electrons , the bosons are free and , therefore , they keep the memory of the initial state , including its energy .",
    "thus the plateau in the visibility of the ab oscillations as a function of the energy of the initial state is not expected .",
    "on the other hand , although the initial electron wave packet splits into two wave packets propagating with different velocities , each of them does not spread further due to the linear dispersion law , as we show below .",
    "therefore , all the initial energy is stored in the space limited by the initial width of the wave packets , and mostly in the form of electron - hole excitations .",
    "this heats the state up to the temperatures of the order of the initial energy , and leads to energy dependent decoherence .    our findings with regards to the important role played by the integrability",
    "raise an interesting question about the nature of the intermediate quasi - stationary state , i.e. , before it reaches the final equilibrium .",
    "indeed , if the initial electron wave packet does not relax to the fermi level despite the strong interactions , what is the energy distribution in the outgoing state ? in order to investigate this question in detail , we follow the suggestion of the refs.~ [ ] and derive the energy distribution and the wigner function of the two outgoing wave packets corresponding to the dipole and the charged mode .",
    "we find that the effect of interactions is twofold : it distributes an electron with an initial energy @xmath4 more or less homogeneously in the interval between @xmath7 and @xmath4 around the fermi level , and it creates a bunch of electron - hole excitations with the excess distribution @xmath8 with a cutoff at @xmath9 .",
    "these our findings may be of great importance for the new field of electron quantum optics , @xcite which is essentially based on creating electron states with the help of single - electron sources .",
    "@xcite    it is worth to mention that a similar problem has been recently addressed @xcite in the context of the experiment of the group of frederic pierre , @xcite where the initial non - equilibrium state was created at the qh edge by injecting electrons via a qpc of transparency @xmath10 , biased with a voltage @xmath11 .",
    "the ref .",
    "[ ] finds that in the case of low transparencies , @xmath12 , the initial double - step electron distribution function relaxes to the quasi - stationary distribution of the form @xmath13 with a high - energy cutoff at @xmath14 , and a low - energy cutoff at @xmath15 .",
    "taking into account our present results , this behaviour can be interpreted as a result of the individual contributions of electron wave packets injected by the qpc , and of the collective effect of the partition noise of the qpc , regularizing the distribution at low energies .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : i ] we introduce the model of the system , starting from the hamiltonian of all the constituting parts , followed by the bosonization prescription . in sec .",

    "[ sec : vii ] is devoted to the derivation of the wigner function and of the distribution function of the outgoing state .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : viii ] .",
    "we start by introducing the hamiltonian of a qd connected to an interferometer ( see fig.[inter ] ) .",
    "we use the effective theory describing edge states as collective fluctuations of the charge density @xmath16 , where indexes @xmath17 label the number of the channel in the state @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the hamiltonian of the quantum hall edge states at filling factor @xmath0 . the charge density operators are expressed in terms of chiral bosonic fields @xmath21 , namely , @xmath22 .",

    "hamiltonian @xmath31 can be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath32 introducing the charged @xmath33 and the dipole @xmath34 modes , respectively .",
    "the new fields satisfy the commutation relations @xmath35=i\\pi\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta_{jk}sgn(x - y).\\ ] ] substituting these fields into the hamiltonian , we obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    the hamiltonian of the qd at the resonance with the fermi level may be written as : @xmath39 where @xmath4 is the energy of the charged qd , with respect to the fermi level in the edge channels , and @xmath40 is the electron annihilation operator at the dot .",
    "the hamiltonian of tunneling between the dot and the channel @xmath41 reads @xmath42 where @xmath5 is the coupling constant . using eq .",
    "( [ fermion - boson - correspondance ] ) , it can be written as @xmath43    finally , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath44 describes the tunneling between the edge channels @xmath41 and @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 , i.e. , the tunnel junctions are placed at the points @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the bosonic representation of the tunneling hamiltonian then acquires the form @xmath51    this model describes the evolution of the initial state of the charged qd with energy @xmath4 .",
    "analysis of the evolution of this state is a complex problem , because the coulomb interaction makes the total hamiltonian non - linear in terms of fermions .",
    "we thus split this problem in two parts .",
    "first , we consider the process of discharging the qd into the qh edge and obtain the electron state on the edge channel as a function of time @xmath52 .",
    "then , we construct an auxiliary initial state in the system without a qd , but which gives the same state as in the previous case after being evolved by the edge hamiltonian at the time @xmath53 , and consider it as the initial state for the interferometer .",
    "this procedure allows us to consider the first part of the problem non - perturbatively with respect to the coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "the second part of the problem is then solved as a perturbation theory with respect to the coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the simplification , justifying this procedure and leading to an exact solution of the problem , arises from the fact that the processes of discharging of the qd and of tunnelling of the excitations in the interferometer take place sequentially , because of the chirality of the edge excitations and of the local nature of the tunneling processes .",
    "as an intermediate step , we consider the case of filling factor @xmath54 and describe the qh edge states using the free - fermion picture .",
    "we obtain the initial state for the interferometer in this case , and then use it to derive the initial state in the case of @xmath0 .    the total hamiltonian of a qd",
    ", tunnel - coupled to a qh edge , reads @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the hamiltonian of the qh edge and the qd , and @xmath57 is the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath58 is the fermi velocity . let us consider the evolution of the single - particle state @xmath59 where @xmath60 . solving the equations of motion @xmath61 @xmath62 with the initial conditions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , implying that at time @xmath65 the qd is charged and the channel is empty , we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the qd level width .",
    "considering the long - time limit @xmath68 , we approximate the single - particle state ( with exponential accuracy ) as @xmath69 because the qd is empty on large times .",
    "let us apply the operator @xmath70 , evolving the state backward in time : @xmath71 it is important that the time evolution of the initial state @xmath72 with hamiltonian @xmath73 therefore results in the single - particle state of the total system containing the qd and the edge channel at time @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , one can show that this result is correct for all times @xmath74 , because of chirality of the edge excitations .",
    "one can therefore replace the problem of finding the evolution of the electron state injected from the qd , by the calculation of the evolution of an auxiliary initial state without the qd .",
    "the many - particle case , then can be obtained with the initial state @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fermi sea ground state of the system .",
    "particularly , a state with an electron injected at point @xmath77 then can be presented as @xmath78 .",
    "the initial state has been obtained for the case of free fermions , therefore it can not describe the case of two quantum channels with the coulomb interaction . as a simple manifestation of this difference we can point out that the initial state ( [ free - fermion - state ] ) of the system contains the fermi velocity @xmath58 of the free fermion problem .",
    "however , it should be characterized by parameters of the real channel , such as velocities @xmath79 and @xmath30 .",
    "the processes of discharging of the qd and further evolution of the edge excitations in the channel have three important properties .",
    "first , during the tunneling process , the electron excitation appears in the electron channel at the point @xmath77 because of the locality of the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ h_tun_d ] ) .",
    "second , the charge in the qd decays exponentially , as in the free - fermion case , but with a different rate @xmath80 , which is determined by the density of electronic states in the channel .",
    "this means that the current in the point @xmath77 also has an exponential profile .",
    "third , the absence of backscattering in the channel and assumed in our model short - range character of the interaction implies the absence of back - action on the qd . since apart from the renormalization of the parameter @xmath80 the tunneling process is not affected by interactions , we find the resulting quantum state using the following method .",
    "we consider a free fermion wave - packet state ( [ free - fermion - state ] ) with certain @xmath80 which is found later , and let it evolve during time @xmath81 with the diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath82\\nonumber\\\\ + & \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{x_0}^\\infty dx [ u(\\partial_x\\xi_1)^2+v(\\partial_x\\xi_2)^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the system where the interactions are only present from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "a state , obtained in a such way is equivalent to the state created in the interacting channel as a result of discharging of the qd .",

    "then the correction takes the form @xmath223,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath224    note , that this correction is a product of the spatially- and energy - dependent functions .",
    "the spatial term reproduces the particle density profile of the injected electron ( [ h_alpha ] ) , while the energy - dependent part becomes relevant only in the region @xmath225 . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy of electrons in a physical system is restricted by the bottom of the electronic band .",
    "therefore , the injection of an electron into the channel must induce a deformation of the bottom of the band , which determines the high - energy correction .     as a function of normalized @xmath207 for @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",

    "@xmath208.,width=321 ]    to summarize this section , we recap the most important stages of the evolution of the state of the injected electron . for the short times",
    "@xmath229 , right after the moment of the injection of an electron into the channel , the two modes start to form .",
    "the energy distribution function of the corresponding state has a lorentzian profile with the energy @xmath4 and the width @xmath80 .",
    "after the time @xmath230 the modes are spatially separated .",
    "the coulomb interaction smears the initial energy distribution function over the region @xmath231 . in the long - time limit",
    "@xmath232 the modes behave independently .",
    "the wigner function of each wave - packet does not change with time , and is characterized by the parameters of the injected electron , namely by @xmath4 and @xmath80 , see fig .",
    "[ total ] . thus , as a result of the integrability of the system , the final steady state retains the memory of the initial state .",
    "interactions , no matter how strong they are , do not lead to a complete relaxation of the initial state . therefore , the visibility vanishes with the increasing energy of the injected electron .",
    "motivated by the puzzling results of the recent experiment from the group of patrice roche [ ] , we have investigated the evolution of a single - electron wave packet in chiral one - dimensional electron channels on the edge of a qh system at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "the experimentalists have used resonant tunnelling of electrons via a qd , tunnel - coupled to the electron channel , in order to create such states , and a mz interferometer embedded downstream of the quantum dot to detect the degree of phase coherence remaining after the strong coulomb interaction between channels has considerably affected the state .",
    "the question that arises in the context of this physical situation is whether the strong interactions are able to relax the initial state , created at the energy @xmath233 , down to the fermi level @xmath234 of one - dimensional electrons of the edge channels , as they typically do for electrons in fermi - liquid systems , or whether the free - bosonic character of the collective charge excitations , resulting in the trivial integrability of the system , does not allow this to happen .    in order to investigate this problem ,",
    "we have applied the model of interacting edge states at filling factor @xmath0 , proposed earlier in ref .  .",
    "this model has been successfully used for the theoretical explanation of a number of recent mesoscopic experiments with qh edge states .",
    "@xcite according to this model , tunnelling of an electron to chiral edge channels is not affected by the interaction and can be described exactly using free - fermionic approach . at the same time , the strong interactions that affect the state after the injection , are non - perturbative , although they can be analysed exactly using the free - bosonic approach . using this technique ,",
    "we have evaluated the visibility of the ab oscillations and have found that it decays with the energy @xmath4 of the initial state as a power - law function [ see eqs .",
    "( [ visibility - one ] ) and ( [ visibility - two ] ) ] , contrary to the observation in ref .  [ ] where it saturates at large energies .",
    "this indicates that despite strong interactions , that considerably deform the initial state before it reaches the interferometer , it still remembers the initial conditions and in particular the energy @xmath4 of the injected state .    in order to further clarify the mechanisms of the relaxation of the initial state towards the quasi - stationary state at long distances , where the interaction splits the electron wave packet into the dipole and the charged modes",
    ", we follow the refs .  [ ] and investigate the electron distribution function and the wigner function of the outgoing state .",
    "we find that the effects of the propagation and of the strong interactions is twofold : they distribute an electron , initially created with energy @xmath4 above the fermi sea , almost homogeneously inside the interval of energies from @xmath7 to @xmath4 , and create a bunch of electron - hole excitations around the fermi level distributed as @xmath235 with the almost sharp cutoff at @xmath217 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ f alpha o ] ) and ( [ asymptotic ] ) ] .",
    "this result helps us to understand the behaviour of the visibility as a function of the initial energy .",
    "indeed , taking into account the fact that the linear dispersion law , assumed for the electrons in our model , conserves the width of the wave packets , the total injected energy @xmath4 is locked inside the finite space interval and this heats the state up to the ( effective ) temperatures of the order of @xmath4 . as a result",
    ", the coherence of the state is suppressed inside the interferometer , depending on the initial energy @xmath4 .",
    "an additional interesting observation is that the excess distribution function @xmath236 that describes the contribution of the injected electron , does not carry the complete charge of one electron ( in other words , its integral over energy is not equal to 1 ) .",
    "however , the point - splitting procedure restores the total charge of the injected electron .",
    "this indicates that the additional contribution to the total electron charge arises from the high energies and can not be directly accounted by the bosonization procedure , which relies on the linearization of the spectrum of electrons .",
    "taking into account the incompressibility of the fermi sea , the remaining charge can only be attributed to the interaction - induced local deformation of the bottom of the conduction band , which propagates with the wave packets .",
    "we support this conclusion by considering an additional example of this effect in appendix [ sec : d ] .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that a similar problem of relaxation of an initial state towards a non - equilibrium quasi - stationary state at the edge of a qh system has been considered in refs .",
    "however , as the initial state , the authors of these works have considered a double - step electron distribution created by voltage biasing a qpc connecting the two channels .",
    "they have found that the excess distribution also scales as @xmath235 and is cutoff at the energies of the order of the voltage bias @xmath237 .",
    "in addition , for the case of low qpc transparencies @xmath238 , the distribution acquires the low - energy cutoff at @xmath239 . taking into account the results of the present paper ,",
    "the conclusion is rather obvious : the electron distribution in this case arises from the individual contributions of the electrons injected trough the qpc in the energy interval from @xmath240 to @xmath237 , accompanied with the effect of partition noise , that cut off the distribution at low energies .",
    "it remains to understand the puzzling results of the experiment [ ] .",
    "the saturation of the visibility at finite values points at an additional physical effect arising at certain energies , which is not accounted for our model , and which can not be explained solely by strong interactions .",
    "we can only speculate that this phenomenon requires accounting for the non - linearities in the spectrum of electrons , and perhaps considering the strong effects of the disorder which is always present at a qh edge .",
