    "in the past decade a number of states in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors have been discovered with properties in conflict with the quark models for mesons which were quite successful in describing the low - lying heavy quarkonium states as @xmath1 @xmath2 states , such as the classical godfrey ",
    "isgur quark model  @xcite and cornell potential model  @xcite .",
    "the newly observed structures in the heavy quarkonium mass region include , among many others , the @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath4  @xcite and the charged states @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite in the charmonium sector and the @xmath8 , @xmath9@xcite in the bottomonium sector ( see , e.g. the mini review on heavy quarkonium spectroscopy in the review of particle physics by the pdg  @xcite ) . because of the failure in describing these structures simply as @xmath1 mesons , they are considered as candidates of exotic hadrons .",
    "various models were proposed to explain these structures , see e.g. ref .",
    "however , no consensus for almost any of these states has been achieved .",
    "it is thus of utmost importance to scrutinize these models , and manifest their distinct predictions . because the near - threshold narrow structures in the continuum channel of the open - flavor meson pair can not be explained by just a threshold cusp  @xcite",
    ", we will assume that all the states to be discussed correspond to physical states .",
    "the dynamical structure of these states are being investigated in several different models .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present distinct predictions of several commonly discussed models .",
    "the scenarios to be considered include the tetraquark model , the hadro - charmonium model , and hadronic molecules .",
    "a brief description of each model including a list of relevant references and a short description of the underlying assumptions will be presented in the corresponding sections .",
    "one has to keep in mind that different components mix with each other whenever such a mixing is not forbidden .",
    "thus , when we present predictions for a certain scenario for a given state , we always mean that we are looking for the consequences that arise if that scenario is assumed to be dominant .",
    "the key feature we are going to exploit in this work is heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) .",
    "it is an approximate symmetry and becomes exact in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks .",
    "it arises because the spin - dependent quark - gluon coupling in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is proportional to the magnetic moment of the heavy quark , and vanishes in the heavy quark limit . as a result",
    ", it leads to spin multiplets . within a multiplet",
    ", the masses are degenerate in the heavy quark limit , and the mass splittings depend on the dynamics of the model for finite quark masses . as will be discussed",
    ", the multiplet structure differs in different scenarios , and thus provides invaluable information .",
    "we will compare the spectroscopy predicted by each of these three scenarios in the following sections .",
    "we close with a summary .",
    "a hadro - quarkonium is a system with a compact heavy quarkonium embedded inside a cloud of light hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "this scenario was motivated by the fact that several charmonium - like states were only observed in final states of a specific charmonium and light hadrons .",
    "examples are the @xmath0 discovered in @xmath10  @xcite , the @xmath7 discovered in @xmath11  @xcite , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 observed in @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the recent besiii observation of similar cross sections for @xmath15 and @xmath16 at 4.26  gev and 4.36  gev in @xmath17 collisions  @xcite stimulated li and voloshin to generalize the hadro - charmonium model to include hqss breaking and describe the @xmath4 and @xmath12 as a mixture of two hadro - charmonia  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the wave functions of the @xmath21 hadro - charmonia with a @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 core charmonium , respectively .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath25 contains predominantly a @xmath26 ( rather than the ground state @xmath27 ) and that @xmath28 contains predominately an @xmath29 .",
    "the decays into the @xmath30 then occur through de - exciting @xmath26 to @xmath27 in the light hadronic matter .",
    "the strength is controlled by the so - called chromo - polarizibility @xmath31 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath15 events seen in @xmath17 collisions at energies around 4.26 and 4.36  gev are mainly from the decays of @xmath4 and @xmath12 , the besiii data imply that @xmath32 is similar to @xmath33 . to achieve this pattern a mixing angle as large as @xmath34",
    "is needed  @xcite .",
    "such a large angle translates into a small mass difference between the @xmath28 and @xmath25 hadro - charmonia since @xmath35 which can be obtained from @xmath36 a mixing angle of around @xmath37 leads to @xmath38  gev , @xmath39  gev and a mixing amplitude @xmath40  mev .",
    "in addition to the interference patterns in the line shapes discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , what else does the proposal of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 as mixed hadro - charmonia imply ? as mentioned in the introduction , hqss is quite useful in this respect .",
    "the binding force between the charmonium core and the surrounding light hadronic matter is due to the exchange of soft gluons . because both the charmonium and light hadronic matter are color singlets , at least two gluons need to be exchanged .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) interaction is due to exchanging two chromo - electric gluons  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the heavy ( anti-)quark spin decouples from such an interaction .",
    "therefore , the lo interaction between the light hadronic matter with a particular heavy quarkonium , [ @xmath1 ] , should be the same as that for the spin partner of that @xmath42 $ ] state .",
    "this means that a hadro - quarkonium should have spin partner(s ) just as its core heavy quarkonium does .    exchanging one chromo - electric and one chromo - magnetic gluon provides a p and cp odd force , and thus induces the mixing between two hadro - quarkonia with core heavy quarkonia of opposite p and cp .",
    "the mixing between the @xmath25 and @xmath28 states , which contain the @xmath26 ( @xmath43 ) and the @xmath29 ( @xmath44 ) , respectively , is such an example .",
    "exchanging two chromo - magnetic gluons provides one source for splitting the masses for one spin multiplet of hadro - quarkonia .",
    "it is suppressed by @xmath45 in comparison with the lo interaction , and gives a tiny correction ( @xmath46 for hadro - charmonium and @xmath47 for hadro - bottomonium ) to the potential energy and thus to the mass of the hadro - quarkonium . the mass splitting between the spin partners within the same multiplet of hadro - quarkonia",
    "is therefore given approximately by the mass splitting between the core heavy quarkonia with the next - to - leading spin symmetry violation controlled by mixing analogous to the one discussed above for the @xmath0 and the @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , analogous to the question of interest , hqss has been used to predict that the @xmath13 as a @xmath48 bound state  @xcite which may be regarded as a specific example of hadro - charmonium has a spin partner : an @xmath49 bound state , with mass of around 4616  mev .    from the discussion above it follows that the @xmath25 state has a spin partner characterized by the same light quark cloud with the @xmath26 in the core replaced by the @xmath50 .",

    "it has @xmath52 and a mass of around @xmath53 similarly , replacing the @xmath29 in the @xmath28 state by any of the @xmath54 states leads to three spin partners of @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite that an @xmath75 state exists with a mass between those of @xmath12 and @xmath0 .    since all the considered hadro - charmonium states are above the corresponding thresholds for the decay into the core charmonium and two pions",
    ", we expect that they decay easily through dissociating the light hadronic matter into two pions , in complete analogy to @xmath0 and @xmath12 that were observed in final states consisting of a charmonium and two pions .",
    "this mechanism will introduce a width of @xmath76  mev , in the ball park of the widths of the @xmath0 and the @xmath12 , for each of them . considering that both the widths of the @xmath50 and the @xmath77 are about 10  mev  @xcite , much larger than those of the @xmath26 and the @xmath29 , the predicted states @xmath78 and @xmath79 can also decay via the decays of the @xmath50 and @xmath77 .",
    "hadro - quarkonia can also decay into open flavor heavy meson and antiheavy meson pairs  @xcite , but it is natural to expect the first mechanism to be dominant .    in the above , we have argued that if the @xmath0 and the @xmath12 are mixed hadro - charmonium states , then it is very likely that they have spin partners as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadrocharmonium ] . thus searching for these partners can provide valuable information on the nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 . in which processes",
    "should they be searched for ? as for the two pseudoscalar states @xmath78 and @xmath79 , because of the probably sizeable mixing , both of them decay into the @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "being pseudoscalars , they can not be produced directly in @xmath17 collisions .",
    "one way of searching for them is to measure the @xmath82 invariant mass distribution for the decays @xmath83 as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for searching for the spin partner of the @xmath13 .",
    "another possible way of searching for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 is to study the radiative decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 . because the branching fraction for @xmath84 is 10%  @xcite , two orders of magnitude larger than that for @xmath85 , both the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states can be produced through the decays of the @xmath25 components of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 into their @xmath86 $ ] components .",
    "hence , one may search for these two states in the process @xmath87 at the center - of - mass energies around the masses of the @xmath0 and the @xmath12 .",
    "the exotic state @xmath88 and the state @xmath89 can be searched for in analogous processes in the decays of @xmath12 with the @xmath77 in the final state replaced by the @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "this kind of measurements may be performed at besiii and a future high - luminosity super tau - charm factory .",
    "if there are hadro - charmonium states , it is natural that the analogous hadro - bottomonium states should exist as well  @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength between the heavy quarkonium and the light hadronic matter is dictated by the chromo - polarizibility which is a matrix element for the propagation of a color - octet @xmath1 pair  @xcite , and thus depends on the wave functions of the heavy quarkonia involved .",
    "numerically it was found that the off - diagonal chromo - polarizability for the transition @xmath92 is a factor of 3 smaller than that for the charmonium analogue @xmath93  @xcite .- wave , and the available phase space for either of them is larger than 560  mev for the @xmath94 invariant mass . in this range",
    ", one expects that the @xmath95 , thus the @xmath94 final state interaction ( fsi ) , plays an important role .",
    "the fsi was neglected in ref .",
    "however , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath94 fsi reduces the values of chromo - polarizability for the @xmath24 and @xmath96 by a similar factor .",
    "one should also keep in mind that the charged bottomonium - like @xmath97 and @xmath98 states couple to both the @xmath99 and @xmath100 , hence contribute to the dipion transition between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "such a contribution has not been taken into account in the analysis of the chromo - polarizability so far . ]",
    "therefore , there is no flavor symmetry connecting the hadro - bottomnium to the hadro - charmonium .",
    "however , because the mixing is induced by exchanging one chromo - electric and one chromo - magnetic gluon , one naively expects that the mixing amplitude for hadro - bottomonium states is much smaller than that for the hadro - charmonium states , and roughly scales down by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "if the unmixed states do not accidentally have a tiny mass difference , one should be able to neglect the mixing between hadro - bottomonium states .",
    "this means that the @xmath23 hadro - bottomonium states ( possibly with a core @xmath96 of higher excitation  @xcite ) , should decay cleanly either into @xmath104 or into @xmath105 .",
    "tetraquarks are four - quark states constructed in analogy to the regular quark model . in particular",

    "the states in each line are ( approximately ) degenerate .",
    "in addition , as before , all of them appear as an isospin singlet and an isospin triplet when we restrict the light quark and anti - quark to be the up and down flavors .",
    "thus , the above list amounts to 56 @xmath66-wave tetraquark states even without radial excitations taken into account .    the assignments of the @xmath23 @xmath66-wave tetraquark states to the observed structures in ref .",
    "@xcite are as follows : among the four @xmath23 states , three of them were identified with the @xmath145 , @xmath0 and @xmath146 , observed in the @xmath147 and @xmath13 observed in @xmath148 correspond to the same state  @xcite . ] and the other one was identified as one of two structures , called @xmath149 observed @xmath150 and @xmath0 observed in @xmath10 correspond to the same state  @xcite . ] and @xmath151 observed in @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 were suggested to be the radial excitations of the @xmath145 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , up to the first radial excitation , only 6 of 112 ( 28 if considering only the isospin singlet ones ) @xmath66-wave tetraquark states have candidates so far .",

    "for states with the same @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath65 and @xmath122 , the mass decreases for increasing @xmath118 , which appears to be a consequence of the negative sign in front of @xmath153 . for instance , among the states @xmath154 with @xmath155 , the @xmath23 state has the largest mass while the @xmath156 one has the smallest .",

    "because the pions are in the adjoint representation of the isospin @xmath191 group , and the non - strange heavy mesons are isospin-1/2 states , each heavy - meson  pion vertex is accompanied by a factor @xmath192 which stands for the pauli matrices operating in the isospin space .",
    "the full one - pion exchange contribution between two heavy mesons therefore comes with a factor @xmath193 , where the subindices label the heavy meson to which the corresponding vertex is attached .",
    "one finds for a given pair of isospin-1/2 particles with total isospin @xmath194 and the third component @xmath195 @xmath196,\\ ] ] which is @xmath197 for @xmath198 and 1 for @xmath199 .",
    "thus , if for a given set of quantum numbers the one - pion exchange contribution is attractive in the isoscalar channel , it will be repulsive in the isovector , and vise versa .",
    "consequently , there is either an isoscalar state _ or _ an isovector state with some fixed quantum numbers , but typically not both .",
    "this is in contrast to the predictions for the tetraquark models discussed in the previous section , since the one - gluon exchange potential is flavor independent .    in this paper",
    "we discuss where to expect @xmath65-wave molecular states from non - perturbative interactions of the @xmath200 multiplet @xmath201 with the anti - particles @xmath202 or with the @xmath203 multiplet @xmath204 .",
    "particles and anti - particles need to be combined such that the states have a well defined @xmath129-parity .",
    "bound systems formed from members of two @xmath203 multiplets are potentially too broad to show a striking signal in experiment and will therefore not be discussed here . within this model space",
    "the following quantum numbers can be reached for @xmath205 , @xmath206 here and in the following , we use the phase convention for the charge conjugation so that @xmath207 with @xmath208 representing any charmed meson and @xmath209 the charge conjugation operator .",
    "whenever there appears more than one state for given quantum numbers , hadronic molecular states may appear as a result of coupled - channel dynamics and very limited statements are possible without a detailed dynamical calculation .",
    "exception to this are the @xmath133 and @xmath210 states .",
    "it is natural to identify the @xmath133 state with the @xmath132 .",
    "in addition , it turned out that hqss forces the binding potentials for these two cases to be equal at lo in the low - energy expansion such that one arrives at the prediction of a tensor state @xmath211 located close to the @xmath212 threshold  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that within a scheme where the one - pion exchange is treated perturbatively , this result is stable under inclusion of the @xmath213 inelastic channel in the @xmath180 wave .",
    "as mentioned above , as a result of the isospin factor of the one - pion exchange , in the molecular picture one does not expect any isovector states with the quantum numbers @xmath133 and @xmath210 .",
    "coupled - channel equations based on lo @xmath65-wave interactions typically produce as many states as the channels included in the calculation .",
    "thus , we expect two states to be present with quantum numbers @xmath22 that strongly couple to @xmath214 and @xmath212",
    ". indeed , both are established experimentally with the isovector states @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "current experimental evidence locates both states above the thresholds  states in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . for @xmath65-wave states",
    "this can be achieved either by momentum dependent interactions  @xcite or non - trivial coupled - channel dynamics .",
    "which one of these mechanisms is at work here ( if any ) requires a detailed model - building which however is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "again , since isovector states are observed one should not expect their isoscalar partner states with @xmath22 quantum numbers .",
    "the situation for @xmath215 is more complicated , since also for this system we are faced with a coupled - channel system .",
    "in addition , the one - pion exchange is not allowed for the diagonal @xmath213 interaction as a consequence of parity conservation .",
    "neither does hqss equalize the lo contact interaction in this channel to that in any other channel  @xcite .",
    "thus , at this point we can not make any statement about the existence or non - existence of hadronic molecular states in the @xmath215 channel .",
    "the number of available channels and quantum numbers for the @xmath216 system is even much larger than the one for @xmath205 : @xmath217    in this case , one can also check in which channels hqss predicts the same lo interaction . for each isospin , 0 or 1 , there are four independent interactions denoted as @xmath218 with @xmath219 : @xmath220 it turns out that for the diagonal interactions all of the above listed channels have a different linear combination of the matrix elements given in eq .  .",
    "therefore , not much can be derived from hqss without further input in this case .",
    "in addition , in case of the @xmath216 system two kinds of one - pion exchange contributions are possible in the channels with odd parity .",
    "they correspond to the @xmath221-channel and @xmath190-channel one - pion exchange , cf .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . denoting the coupling constants for the coupling of a pion with two @xmath222 states ( @xmath66-wave ) , with two @xmath223 states ( @xmath66-wave ) and connecting a @xmath222 state and a @xmath223 state ( @xmath180-wave ) by @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 ,",
    "respectively , the potential for the @xmath221-channel exchange is proportional to @xmath227 and the one for the @xmath190-channel exchange is proportional to @xmath228 . while the magnitude and sign of the coupling constant @xmath224 are fixed by data and lattice qcd calculations , nothing is known yet about @xmath225 .",
    "therefore , we can not identify the channels where the corresponding one - pion exchange potential is attractive .",
    "the situation is different for the part of @xmath190-channel exchange with two @xmath180-wave vertices proportional to @xmath228 ( although the additional momentum factors on the vertices might suppress this part of the potential ) . looking only at the sign of this @xmath190-channel exchange contribution for the uncoupled channels , one finds attraction for isoscalar states with the exotic quantum numbers @xmath143 and @xmath229 , while this part of the interaction is attractive in the isovector channel with the quantum numbers @xmath230 and @xmath156",
    "however , as mentioned above , since for these systems we can not even analyze the complete one - pion exchange contribution no strong conclusion can be drawn regarding the existence or non - existence of these states .    for the quantum numbers @xmath231 , @xmath232 three channels couple to each other .",
    "thus , here even less can be said without dynamical analysis . however , some general statements are still possible .",
    "for instance , since hadronic molecular states appear in the vicinity of @xmath65-wave thresholds , the lightest molecular state in the @xmath216 family is expected to be close to the lowest threshold , namely @xmath233 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : molecules ] ) , and with the quantum numbers of either @xmath23 or @xmath74 . indeed , in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 was proposed to be ( predominantly ) a @xmath233 bound state with @xmath21 , and in ref .  @xcite the molecular states with exotic quantum numbers @xmath234 were investigated .    for the quantum numbers",
    "@xmath235 , if a corresponding state exists at all , it should be around the @xmath236 threshold and thus more than 100 mev above the mass of the @xmath0 . while this mass range is similar to what is predicted in the tetraquark picture , it is very different to what is predicted in the hadro - charmonium scenario , where the @xmath230 states are predicted to be the lightest of their kind .",
    "one striking distinction between the tetraquark picture and the hadronic molecular scenario becomes visible for the @xmath157 states : while in the tetraquark model of ref .  @xcite those are amongst the lightest states , in the hadronic molecular picture , if they exist , they should be close to the @xmath237 threshold , again more than 100  mev above the @xmath0 , cf .",
    "[ fig : molecules ] .",
    "in this work we have investigated the exotic charmonium spectrum in different scenarios based on hqss . in particular , we have compared the spectra arising from three models , i.e. hadro - charmonium , tetraquark and hadronic molecule , which turn out to provide quite distinct predictions for not yet discovered  @xmath238 \" states .    in the hadro - charmonium scenario",
    "we find that if @xmath0 and @xmath12 are mixed hadro - charmonium states with @xmath21 as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite then two spin partners with @xmath52 and two more with @xmath234 and @xmath239 , respectively , should exist as well .",
    "their possible production and decay modes are discussed to guide the experimental search in the future .    in the tetraquark scenario",
    "the spectrum is much richer than in other scenarios with approximate degeneracies between isospin singlet and triplet states .",
    "if one assigns the observed @xmath132 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 to the @xmath65-wave states , some of the states with @xmath21 can also be assigned to the @xmath66-wave tetraquark states , i.e. @xmath145 , @xmath0 and @xmath146 , while the possible existence of two @xmath23 states , @xmath149 and @xmath151 in @xmath240 will accommodate all the @xmath66-wave @xmath23 tetraquark ground states .",
    "however , it should be noted that so far only a small number of predicted tetraquark states can be assigned to existing observations  at least 67 among 80 of the ground states are left to be discovered , if compact tetraquarks provide the dominant components of the new @xmath238 states .    in the scenario of hadronic molecule",
    "very little can be said without detailed modeling of the relevant hadron - hadron potentials . under the assumption that the one - pion exchange potential plays a dominant role ,",
    "one expects bound states to appear either in the isoscalar or isovector channel but not in both simultaneously .",
    "the observation of the isospin singlet @xmath132 and the isospin triplet @xmath134 and @xmath135 without evidence of isospin partners matches this expectation well . taking into account that the constituent mesons are to be narrow enough in the hadronic molecular system , the allowed number for hadronic molecules formed by low - lying narrow charmed meson pairs turns out to be a lot smaller than what is predicted within the tetraquark scenario .    in order to highlight",
    "that the spectroscopy of the different scenarios is indeed very different we summarize the implications for two quantum numbers : amongst the three models only the hadro - charmonium scenario predicts 2 @xmath230 states with one of them being even lighter than the @xmath0 . in the tetraquark picture",
    "also two @xmath230 states appear , however , both are predicted to be heavier than @xmath0 . due to lack of a dynamical model , in the hadronic molecular picture",
    "there is no prediction yet for a @xmath230 state , however , if it exists it should be located near the @xmath241 threshold  again above the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , we find that the tetraquark model of ref .",
    "@xcite and hadronic molecular scenarios predict strikingly different patterns for the @xmath157 states . in the former scenario",
    "the @xmath242 state is expected to be among the lightest states , while in the hadronic molecular scenario the @xmath157 states should have masses close to the @xmath243 threshold if they exist .",
    "an observation of the @xmath157 states should provide crucial information about the underlying dynamics .",
    "it is very important to test the different scenarios in future experimental studies at lhcb , besiii , belle - ii , panda and others .",
