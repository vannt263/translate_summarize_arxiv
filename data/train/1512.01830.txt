    "but the question we are most interested in is : what overdamping phenomena can occur for a two - component composite system with a lossy and a lossless component when the loss fraction condition ( [ sintro4a ] ) , that is , @xmath94 , is satisfied ?",
    "the answer is that ( generically ) some of the modes of the system will be overdamped and some will be underdamped , and we refer to this phenomenon as _ selective overdamping_. in the next subsection , we will give a brief description of this phenomenon along with our motivation for its study , and in the subsection afterwards give an overview of our main results .      an important motivation for our studies of two component dissipative gyroscopic system is the development of a theory of broadband absorption suppression in magnetic composites .",
    "such a theory , we believe , can provide guiding principles for the design of broadband low - loss magnetic composites with functionality comparable to bulk magnetic materials .",
    "the development of theory requires a deeper understanding of the interplay between losses and magnetism manifested as gyroscopic effects .",
    "there are numerious applications of low loss magnetic materials .",
    "for instance , they are crucial components in many microwave , infrared , and optical devices @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "detrimental to the performance of many such devices are the high losses associated with the magnetic materials in frequency ranges of interest , @xcite , @xcite , and this is a major problem with many natural and synthetic magnetic materials .",
    "the discussion above raises a question if such broadband absorption suppression in composites even possible ?",
    "quite remarkably , the answer is yes .",
    "this result was firmly established in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xcite an example was given of a two - component dielectric medium composed of a high - loss and lossless components , namely , a magnetophotonic crystal ( mpcs ) consisting of a finite stack of alternating lossy magnetic and lossless dielectric layers .",
    "they showed that the magnetic composite could reduce the absorption ( losses ) by two orders of magnitude in the chosen frequency range compared to those of the uniform bulk magnetic material while simultaneously enhancing one of its desired magnetic properties , namely , nonreciprocal faraday rotation . that example demonstrated that it is possible to design a composite material / system which can have a desired property comparable with a naturally occurring bulk substance but with significantly reduced losses .",
    "in addition to this , an interesting and rather counterintuitive idea arose , which was first introduced in @xcite , and also recently noticed independently in @xcite for mpcs .",
    "it is the idea that reduction of losses in the magnetic composite and enhancement of the magnetic properties / functionality might actually be more substantial when the lossy magnetic component is replaced by another with even higher losses .",
    "what is the origin of that seemingly counterintuitive behavior in composites ? in order to understand the general mechanism for this behavior , we developed in @xcite a model , based on the linear response theory from @xcite and @xcite , for two - component composite systems with a high - loss and lossless component and introduced in @xcite a lagrangian framework , based on the lagrangian - hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics , in order to account for the physical properties of the composite system .",
    "we showed that for such composite systems the losses of the entire system become small provided that the lossy component is sufficiently lossy .",
    "this behavior can be explained by two important phenomena , namely , the _ modal dichotomy _ and _",
    "overdamping_.    as the focus of this paper is on the study of these two phenomena in gyroscopic - dissipative systems , we will provide a brief explaination from our studies in @xcite , @xcite on how these phenomena contribute to the loss suppression .",
    "we introduce first a dimensionless loss parameter @xmath66 which scales the dissipation in the lossy component of the system .",
    "we consider then the system eigenmodes , i.e. , the states of the system in the absence of external forces with exponential time dependency of the form @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the frequency , @xmath97 is the damping factor , and @xmath98 is the relaxation time . to any such mode is associated its quality factor ( q - factor ) @xmath99 , which is an important figure of merit that helps to characterize the performance of the dissipative composite system . now as the losses in the lossy component of the composite system become sufficiently large , i.e. , @xmath100 , the entire set of eigenmodes of the composite system splits into two classes , _ high - loss _ and _ low - loss modes _ , based on their dissipative properties . we refer to this phenomenon",
    "as the _ modal dichotomy_. one important feature of this dichotomy is that the high - loss modes decay exponentially in time with both an extremely small relaxation time @xmath101 and q - factor @xmath51 that decrease with @xmath102 and @xmath103 as @xmath104 . on the other hand , the low - loss modes have an extremely large relaxation time @xmath101 which increases with @xmath105 as @xmath104 , whereas the q - factor @xmath51 either decreases or increases with @xmath103 or @xmath106 , respectively , as @xmath104 ( as to this behavior of the q - factor and whether such low - loss high - q modes even exist , we address this in the next paragraph ) .",
    "moreover , in lagrangian systems , when the loss of the high - loss component exceeds a finite critical value , i.e. , @xmath107 , the frequencies of the all the high - loss eigenmodes become exactly zero , i.e. , @xmath108 for @xmath107 , a phenomenon known as overdamping . consequently , when the composite is excited by external forces at frequencies ranges well separated from zero , the high - loss modes hardly respond to these excitations because they are overdamped with extremely small relaxation time , and hence do not contribute much to the entire composite losses .",
    "this analysis leads to the important question : do such high - q modes even exist in systems with a high - loss component ?",
    "as discussed in @xcite , @xcite the answer is yes , but not always and composites with a high - loss component @xmath100 are key to selectively suppressing low - q modes and enhancing high - q modes .",
    "more precisely , one of the main result of our studies in @xcite is that a rather universal phenomenon , called _ selective overdamping _ , occurs for non - gyroscopic composite systems whenever the lossy component of the composite is sufficiently lossy @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , we proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 25 and 26 ) that for a lagrangian system governed by evolution equations ( [ sintro1 ] ) , that it will occur for @xmath100 whenever @xmath14 , @xmath94 , and @xmath110",
    ". the term _ selective _",
    "was used to refer to the fact that only a fraction , namely , the loss fraction @xmath111 , of the system s eigenmodes are overdamped , specifically , all the high - loss modes and an equal number of low - loss modes , whereas the remaining _ positive fraction , namely , _ @xmath112 _ _",
    "@xmath111 _ _ , of modes are low - loss oscillatory modes ( i.e , the underdamped modes ) with high quality factor that actually becomes higher the more lossy the lossy component becomes in the system__.    since overdamping phenomenon has a potential to be a mechanism for significant broadband absorption suppression in composites , we are motivated to analyze and understand it better , especially in gyroscopic - dissipative systems .",
    "it turns out that as the losses in the lossy component increase the overdamped high - loss modes are more suppressed while all the low - loss oscillatory modes are more enhanced with increasingly high quality factor .",
    "_ this provides a mechanism for selective enhancement of these high quality factor , low - loss oscillatory modes ( the underdamped modes ) and selective suppression of the high - loss non - oscillatory modes_.      the main goal of this paper is to understand if the selective overdamping phenomenon can occur in gyroscopic systems , and if so whether it as universal of a phenomenon as for non - gyroscopic systems .",
    "one of the major achievements of this paper , we think , is that we have found sufficient conditions for overdamping to occur for the high - loss modes , have derived uppper bounds on the amount of loss required , and have given estimates on the frequencies , damping factors , and q - factors for the underdamped modes .",
    "in addition to that , a simple example is given in section [ scircuits ] of an electric circuit with a resistor and a gyrator which illustrates our ideas , methods , and results both analytically and numerically .",
    "in this section , we will give an overview of the main results of this paper , which are formulated precisely and proven in section [ smainr ] .",

    ", we have an interesting example , example [ sodngc ] , which shows an extreme case of what can happen for dissipative systems which are gyroscopic ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) .    we will begin by introducing some notation .",
    "after this we will discuss the modal dichtotomy in section [ sbsbsecmd ] and then , in section [ sbsbsecsod ] , conclude with a description of the overdamping phenomenon in terms of the modal dichotomy .",
