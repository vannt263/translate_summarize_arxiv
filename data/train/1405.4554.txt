    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the main sources of galactic cosmic rays , charged particles with energies up to @xmath8 ev that are thought to gain their energy mainly through the mechanism of first order fermi acceleration in the shocks of snrs @xcite and its non - linear modification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , since these particles do not travel directly from their sources due to the presence of galactic magnetic fields that change their directions of motion , the cosmic ray content of snrs is studied indirectly by analyzing the properties of their non - thermal photon spectrum .",

    "these electrons may also produce leptonic gamma - ray photons through inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of low energy ambient photons and bremsstrahlung emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gamma - rays may also result from hadronic interactions through the decay of neutral @xmath9mesons produced in inelastic collisions between cosmic - ray protons ( or ions ) and ambient nuclei .",
    "the detection of a characteristic pion decay signature in the gamma - ray spectrum of snrs would therefore constitute direct evidence for the existence of high - energy cosmic rays in these sources .",
    "an important window of observations , with improved energy and angular resolution , mainly in the range from @xmath10 100 mev to 300 gev , has been opened with the launch of the _ fermi _ observatory @xcite .",
    "however , most studies of gamma - ray observations of snrs have yielded ambiguous results regarding the nature of the emission .",
    "snrs that are relatively bright in gamma - rays and interact with molecular clouds , such as w28 , w49b , w51c , g8.7 - 0.1 and , possibly , rcw 103 , show spectra that seem to favour a hadronic origin @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been claimed that , below @xmath10 100 mev , the spectrum of the snrs ic 443 and w44 can not be accounted for by leptonic mechanisms and shows a typical hadronic behaviour @xcite .",
    "other examples of gev snrs include the lower luminosity extended sources cygnus loop @xcite , s147 @xcite and g296.5 + 10.0 @xcite ; and younger snrs , such as cas a @xcite , tycho s snr @xcite , rcw 86 @xcite , rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite and rx j0852.0 - 4622 @xcite .    in this paper , cumulative observations of the region around the snr hb9 ( g160.9 + 2.6 ) by the large area telescope ( lat )",

    "based on x - ray observations , a distance of 1.5 kpc and an age of @xmath12 kyr are estimated @xcite , while a distance of @xmath13 kpc is obtained from a likely association with hi structures @xcite .",
    "there are several other estimates of these parameters in the literature , for example , the evaporative cooling model developed by white & long @xcite give an age of 4 - 7 kyr and an explosion energy of @xmath14 erg .",
    "an explosion energy of @xmath15 erg , an age of 8 kyr and a distance of 1 kpc are adopted in this work .",
    "the large extension of the snr has allowed radio spectral studies in different regions of the source . after subtracting background radio sources ,",
    "flux measurements have yielded a radio spectral index @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) between 408 and 1420 mhz @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite for the remnant .",
    "spatial variations in spectral index seen @xcite imply that the radio spectra of regions near the rim of hb9 are harder than those of regions towards the interior of the remnant , which is explained in terms of a higher compression and therefore higher magnetic field values at larger distances from the center of the snr , which is also consistent with the higher radio brightness seen in the outer shell compared to the interior @xcite .",
    "hb9 is believed to be located near the molecular clouds sh217 and sh219 @xcite , but no definitive interaction with a molecular cloud has been claimed .",
    "as has been mentioned , ambient gas interacting with snrs might provide target material for cosmic - ray collisions , which is thought to be responsible for an enhancement of gamma - ray emission seen in some sources .",

    "the extension of the snr offers an exciting opportunity to carry out studies on spatially - dependent particle acceleration .",
    "for example , a spatial study of the radio emission in the band 408 - 1420 mhz has shown that synchrotron emission from the center of the shell is softer than that from the outer shell @xcite . however , the current statistics of the gamma - ray observation is too low to draw definitive conclusions regarding any possible variation of the flux level or of the spectral parameters across the source .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum is consistent with an inverse compton scenario where cmb photons are up - scattered by the synchrotron - emitting electrons responsible for the radio emission .",
    "the physical parameters derived are reasonable ( magnetic field 8 @xmath64 g , total electron energy of 2.7% of the available energy ) and consistent with observations in the x - ray band ( low ambient density , @xmath78 @xmath68 ) .",

    "a hadronic interpretation might seem less likely due to the low ambient densities observed .",
    "the required mean density across the snr is around 1 @xmath68 for a total cosmic ray energy of 20% of the available energy of @xmath91 erg ( or higher density for a corresponding lower cosmic ray energy content ) . a power - law with exponential cutoff momentum distribution with index @xmath92 and cutoff momentum 80 gev / c for the protons can account for the gamma - ray sed .",

    "the radio observations of this object above 3 ghz could discard this scenario if the same power - law synchrotron emission is present at higher radio frequencies .",
    "the high density requirement can be relaxed by increasing the total energy in the electrons and lowering the magnetic field ( the value used is 6 @xmath64 g ) .",
    "however , the magnetic field is likely not lower than at least the typical galactic value ( @xmath103 @xmath64 g ) .    for both the hadronic and bremsstrahlung scenarios",
    "the density requirements could be easily achieved if the snr interacts with clumps of high density material in its environment .",
    "new observations should be carried out to confirm or discard this possibility .",
    "finally , it is noted that a better fit to the sed might be obtained with more complex scenarios such as those involving several particle populations .",
