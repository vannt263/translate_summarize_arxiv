    "it has been stated for a long time that the solar atmospheric plasma is not in a neutral state nor in a fully ionized state .",
    "the effects of the partial ionization have been taken into account in many contexts , such as spectral line formation and inversion techniques .",
    "the influence of this plasma state on the dynamics becomes currently the focus of many investigations as well @xcite .",
    "many studies of chromospheric and coronal plasma dynamics use the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) as main tool for successfully understanding the complex structure and dynamical processes of these solar atmospheric layers , but the standard mhd theory does not include partial ionization effects .",
    "an extended multi - fluid theory is a conceptually simple form to start integrating these effects without invoking mathematically more complex statistical approaches ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the basic assumptions of a multi - fluid theory is that the plasma is composed of different species , each of them behaving like a fluid and interacting with the rest of species , either directly or under certain conditions , with the collisional coupling between the fluids relatively weak .",
    "hence , the plasma mostly behaves as a single fluid , but in certain processes there might be deviations between the dynamical and thermal properties of the different species , that are then smoothed by the interactions in relatively short time - scales ( typically of the order of minutes ) .",
    "the general transport equations for a multi - component plasma can be derived from the boltzmann kinetic equation , taking into account general properties of the collisional terms @xcite .",
    "a basic assumption is that the collisional terms can be approximated as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the collision frequency between the species labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the mean velocity of the species labelled @xmath5 . using this formalism , an equation for the relative velocity ( referred as `` drift '' velocity in the rest of the paper ) between ions and neutrals , namely @xmath6 , can be written as @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 - \\frac{\\vec{g}}{\\alpha_n } + m_e\\nu_{en}\\frac{\\vec{j}}{e \\alpha_n}\\ ] ]    in this equation @xmath8 is the neutral fraction ; @xmath9 is the sum of collisional frequencies between neutrals and other species multiplied by the corresponding mass densities ; @xmath10 is the electron - neutral collisional frequency ; @xmath11 is the magnetic field vector , @xmath12 is the current ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron mass and charge .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is the partial pressure gradient term , being @xmath16 the electron pressure and @xmath17 the neutral pressure .",
    "equation [ eq : w ] comes from combining the momentum equations for the electron , ion and neutral fluids , and neglecting the inertia terms compared to the friction terms .",
    "its derivation is given in details in section iv b of @xcite .",
    "introducing this drift velocity in the combined momentum equation of charged species , the induced electric field and the generalized induction equation can also be obtained @xcite .",
    "the existence of these drifts between species is thus a direct consequence of the partial ionization , and reflects that the coupling between the fluids is not strong enough to behave as a single fluid .",
    "however , in the physical conditions of the solar atmosphere , these terms are small , and electric fields and drift velocities are rapidly dissipated .",
    "the scale depends on the details of the process and the values of the physical parameters , but simulations show that the time scales involved are typically of the order of minutes or even less @xcite , since the collisions are still efficient enough to prevent large deviations from single fluid theory .    to detect these effects , it is then necessary to measure as accurately as possible the velocity of different species at the same spatial position and simultaneously . evaluating these drifts",
    "does not rely on unknown relations or assumptions , since measuring the doppler shifts of different lines is straightforward . in a recent work",
    ", we made an attempt to detect differences between velocities of the evershed flow measured co - spatially and simultaneously from spectral lines of neutral and ionized iron atoms @xcite .",
    "the results reveal a slightly larger velocity of the evershed flow in neutral lines .",
    "however , the drawback of such kind of measurements is the use of spectral lines with different formation heights in the photosphere of the sun . on the one hand",
    ", there is an uncertainty regarding the precise formation height , depending on the model atmosphere taken and on the position on the limb , especially in an inhomogeneous environment such as a sunspot penumbra . on the one hand , the photosphere is dense and collisional effects dominate , which results in lower drift velocities expected according to equation [ eq : w ] . in the present paper , we try to improve these two aspects .",
    "we choose as a target a solar prominence because its plasma can be considered relatively optically thin so that the formation region of different spectral lines largely occupies the same plasma volume .",
    "in addition , the physical conditions in prominences are expected to give rise to a significant partial ionization with a considerable amount of neutral and ionized species , depending upon the height in the prominence where measurements are made .",
    "velocity fields are also non negligible and important mass flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , as well as instabilities have been observed @xcite .",
    "instabilities may also lead to mass motions that can have a different impact on neutral and ions @xcite .",
    "our main aim here is to investigate if any measurable drift velocity can be reliably detected in these structures and to discuss the implications of a possible detection in terms of partial ionization effects .",
    "the data used in this study were taken at the german vacuum tower telescope ( vtt , observatorio del teide , tenerife ) on 2012 september 11 .",
    "several targets were registered during this campaign , but here we focus on one particular series where a prominence near ar11564 at s12w83 was observed continuously for more than half an hour with relatively good seeing conditions for the entire observation . the uncorrected @xmath18 parameter given by the adaptive optics ( ao ) software of the telescope @xcite gave values close to 10 cm during the whole series .",
    "the target was an active prominence undergoing evolution during the observation .",
    "it had well developed barbs , and at some parts of the slit there was some contamination from surges coming from the nearby active region that were superimposed with the prominence material .",
    "the ao system was working quite well locked in a nearby pore near the solar limb and did only jump once in the whole series .",
    "we simultaneously detected spectra of  10830   and  8542    lines using the detector of the tenerife infrared polarimeter ( tip ii * ? ? ? * ) for the former and a camera optimized for the visible part of the spectrum for the latter .",
    "the spatial sampling along the slit was 018 , the same for both detectors .",
    "the time cadence was 1.5 sec per slit position for both spectral lines .",
    "to ensure such a high cadence and an acceptable noise level we did not use the polarimetric capabilities of tip - ii and only detected intensity spectra .",
    "the set has 1200 frames organized as follows : 120 scans of the body of the prominence in ten scanning positions separated by 035 in the direction perpendicular to the slit .",
    "this means that an area of 35 was observed and spectra at a fixed position were taken every 15 sec .",
    "additionally , a slit - jaw  camera provided full field - of - view images of the prominence in the core of this spectral line .",
    "an example of an  image can be seen at the left panel of figure [ halpha ] .",
    "notice that these data were not used in this study anymore , since the camera did not provide spectral information about the  line .",
    "we only used  images to put the results from the other lines in context .    using the data from sdo 304   channel ( right panel of figure [ halpha ] )",
    ", we can see that the target prominence was close to the ar11564 .",
    "the prominence itself can be seen in absorption on the disc during the previous days , and seems to be an active one related to the active region .",
    "the prominence spine was almost parallel to the limb and the prominence remained quite stable , despite the active region emitted jets during the observation .",
    "this particular active region did not produce any flare during the days before and after the observation .",
    "the raw  and  spectra were reduced using a standard procedure .",
    "first of all , the data were cleaned from discrepancies between pixel counts from different parts of the ccd cameras by subtracting the averaged dark current images taken before and after the observational sequence .",
    "then , the data were corrected for flat field individually in each spectral region using the corresponding scans in  and   taken before and after the series at the solar disc center .",
    "the continuum of the flat field images was normalized to 10000 counts .",
    "the same normalization factor was applied to the prominence data , and the final amplitudes of the reduced spectra are in the same units of the disc center continuum for both lines .",
    "finally , the only tip - tilt jump in the series was corrected by adequately displacing the spectral images in the slit direction .",
    "after these operations , data cubes of spectra of each of the two lines were obtained in every pixel along the slit and for any temporal position of the series . to perform the wavelength calibration",
    ", we compared the average flat field spectrum of the lines with the fts atlas @xcite .",
    "the spectral sampling of the  spectra was 16.5 m / pixel , and 11.0 m / pixel for  , and the spectral range was covered by 668 and 1010 pixels , respectively .",
    "the signal to noise level in the reduced spectra was about 11 in  line and of about 400 in  line .",
    "the signal - to - noise level in  line was relatively low because the emission is intrisically lower in this line and because of the low quantum efficiency of the camera used .",
    "the  spectra were further filtered using a principal component analysis technique @xcite which clearly improved the signal - to - noise ratio , as can be seen in fig.[fig : spectra ] . for that , each  profile was represented by a linear combination of a set of eigenvectors @xmath19 with appropriate constant coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 the system of eigenvectors was obtained from a dataset of randomly chosen 4000  profiles using a singular value decomposition ( svd ) method @xcite . in practice",
    "most of the eigenvectors do not carry information about the shape of the profiles , but only about the particular noise pattern of each profile .",
    "the truncation of the series allows therefore to remove the information about noise and to improve the signal no noise ratio .",
    "we truncated the expansion after the first 25 terms .",
    "this allowed to improve the signal to noise level in  by a factor of approximately 3.5 .",
    "we fitted the observed  and  line profiles to obtain the physical parameters of the plasma necessary for our study .",
    "the structure of the  spectra is generally relatively simple and consists of a single emission line profile .",
    "therefore , we fitted the  line with a single gaussian profile ( with a base line that accounts for stray light coming from the disc ) , using the following equation    @xmath22 + a_3 \\label{eq : caprof}\\ ] ]    with four degrees of freedom in the fit",
    ". non - linear least square fits routines were used to find the best fit for these parameters , and the result is very good in over 80% of the spectra .",
    "however , since the  line counts were relatively low , at some pixels the noise led to problems in the fit .",
    "hence , only those pixels in which the maximum number of counts on at least one spectral position was over 5 times the noise level were selected and fitted . because of this reason we excluded about 39% of pixels where the prominence was not visible in   in the field of view .",
    "such locations appear as black in the upper left and middle panels of figure [ fig : ajuste ] .",
    "multi - component profiles were also present at some time instants and locations , produced by surges and jets .",
    "the single - component fit failed for the profiles where multicomponent signals were clearly present .",
    "such locations were identified and excluded from the analysis of velocities performed below .    regarding the helium triplet line , we chose as a typical line profile a two - gaussian mold with fixed spectral separation and same width , and a with constant base line .",
    "the red components of the profile nearly overlap , so we have used a single gaussian profile for them instead of resolving them separately ( as in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have not imposed fixed relative amplitudes between the elements of the triplet , therefore the ratio of the amplitudes of the blue and red components allows us to consider the opacity effects .",
    "those effects are expected to be low for prominence material .",
    "the shape of the profile is then given by @xmath23 } \\nonumber \\\\   & + & a_3 \\exp{\\left[\\frac{-(x - a_1)}{2 a_2}\\right ] } + a_4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with five degrees of freedom . the spectral separation ( @xmath24 ) was obtained as the difference between the average positions of the red and blue components , see @xcite . as mentioned above , the number of counts is much higher in the  line than in the  line . virtually , we could find a significant signal in all areas of the prominence .",
    "nevertheless , the complicated structure of the triplet implied that in those cases where more than one contribution was present , the least - square fit could not distinguish if the signal had only one contribution of several of them ( except in a few selected cases ) .    for both  and  lines",
    "the fits were weighted to give more relevance to spectral points with higher counts , since we are more interested in the peak position for velocity determination .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we have plotted some spectra for the  and  lines taken at the same position and simultaneously .",
    "we have overplotted the result of the best fit in red lines .",
    "the first pair ( panels @xmath25 ) corresponds to a regular point where the single component fit was very accurate ; we can also check that in this particular example both spectral lines are blue - shifted .",
    "however , there are other spectra which show significant extra components in the red wing ( panels @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) or the blue wing ( panes @xmath14 and @xmath28 ) of . in the cases as those shown in panels @xmath26 and @xmath27 the velocity shift between the components is relatively mild , while in the cases @xmath14 and @xmath28 is becomes more pronounced . at some rare instants",
    "there are components that only appear in one of the lines , such as happens at the panel @xmath28 , where there is a discernible contribution in the  blue wing , but no significant contribution in the  triplet , although the secondary peak is slightly higher .",
    "this is related to the fact that  line is much wider than the  one and multiple components can be more easily distinguished in the latter case .",
    "there is also a prominent example of the contrary behavior , shown in the panel @xmath29 where the  line shows a clear multiple component structure , while the  signal is low amplitude and asymmetric with a discernible low - amplitude red component in its wing .",
    "nevertheless , in most of the cases both lines show the same features and thus we can conclude that the plasma emitting these lines is having very similar dynamical properties . even if secondary components are present , their amplitudes in the majority of the cases are very close to the noise level .",
    "the single component fit is accurate enough in over a 80% of the points .",
    "while single - component fit is acceptable in the cases shown in the panels @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( with a somewhat larger width in the cases @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , the profiles as those shown in the panels @xmath29 , @xmath14 and @xmath28 can not be reliably handled with such a fit .",
    "their space time location is related to a plasma ejection from the nearby active region that happens to overlap with the prominence .      since in this work",
    "we are interested in reliably establishing the difference between the velocities of neutral and ionized atoms , we proceeded by discarding space - time locations where the velocities can not be measured reliably .",
    "besides disregarding those points where the amplitude of the signal was too low , we used the additional following criteria to identify such locations :    * locations where the width obtained after the fit is above 6   in  line or above 12  in  line .",
    "the line width above these values reveals the presence of multiple components separated in velocity but not spectrally resolved .",
    "we excluded 2% of pixels due to this criterion .",
    "* locations where the width obtained after the fit is below 1  in  line , since an extremely low line width indicates errors of the fit .",
    "we also used this criterion to select locations where the signal in both  and  lines is reliably measured .",
    "this criterion coincides with the one based on the number of counts to identify the locations where the signal is above the noise in  line .",
    "about 39% of pixels were excluded .",
    "* locations where the amplitude of the blue - wing or red - wing signal in  is above a certain level .",
    "we choose as a reference the wavelengths 1.4   and -1.96   to the red and to the blue from the average line center position of the red component .",
    "the presence of a significant signal at these locations can be indicative of the existence of several components with large difference in velocities overlapping at the line of sight .",
    "* locations where the ratio of the amplitudes of the blue and red component of  is above 0.24 or below 0.12 . in the optically thin plasma",
    "this ratio should be exactly equal to 1/8=0.125 .",
    "larger values indicate that the plasma is not completely optically thin and lower values are not physically feasible .",
    "since our aim is to measure  and  velocities originating from the same plasma , we discarded the locations where the plasma becomes thicker than a certain threshold , which would introduce an uncertainty about the location where the signal in both lines originates .",
    "about 5.5% of points suffer this kind of problem in our data .",
    "most of them are coincident with the criterion based on the amplitude of the blue - wing or red - wing signal in  above .    since in some of the pixels various items from listed above are present simultaneously , all in all we excluded about 44% of pixels .",
    "the last criterion is the most important one in our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows the map of the ratio between the blue and red components of , @xmath30 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : heprof ] .",
    "it shows that the amplitude ratio varies around the mean value of about 0.18 for most of the prominence locations .",
    "the spatial variation of the ratio is in a narrow range staying essentially between 0.16 and 0.20 .",
    "it indicates that the plasma in the observed prominence is very close to be optically thin with a very small spatial variation of the opacity .",
    "one distinguishes also some isolated locations where the ratio is above 0.24 or below 0.12 .",
    "those locations are marked by red contours and are excluded from the analysis .",
    "the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] shows the map of the  signal in the red and blue wings , correspondingly .",
    "it can be seen that the locations with @xmath31 coincide with those of the strong blue - shifted signal ( right panel ) and those with @xmath32 coincide with the red - shifted signal ( middle panel ) .",
    "this brings the last two criteria in the above list to be the same .",
    "in order to evaluate the velocity errors associated to the fit we proceed in the following way . the proper non - linear fitting routines gives a formal error of the fit of each of the free parameters in eqs .",
    "[ eq : caprof ] and [ eq : heprof ] .",
    "however , those errors are very small and do not give a true evaluation of the uncertainty but a measure of the inaccuracy of the fitting procedure .",
    "we therefore assumed that the uncertainties of the velocity measurements are limited by the wavelength resolution of observations .",
    "we took an upper estimate for such errors of half a pixel in wavelength .",
    "this gives us an uncertainty of @xmath33  in  and @xmath34  in .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the zero velocity position was done by comparing the averaged spectra of each of the lines to the fts atlas and correcting for the velocity of solar rotation at the latitude of the observed prominence , according to @xcite .          to be able to compare as accurately as possible the signal from the two lines , we need to take into account the differential refraction from the earth atmosphere .",
    "the setup of the campaign ensured that the data from the two spectral regions were taken simultaneously and with the telescope pointing to the same place , but since both infrared lines have different wavelengths , they experiment a different refraction angle , so the light entering the optical system of the telescope does not originate from the same position in the sun .",
    "because of the orientation of the slit during the observation , this effect was almost in the direction of the scan .",
    "a direct calculation ( using the time of the day and the relative position of the sun to the horizon ) gives us a value of 03 .",
    "additionally , we have compared the images from the different scanning positions in order to find the best correlation between them . in figure",
    "[ fig : correlation ] we plot the correlation between the time - slit maps of velocities for different scanning positions .",
    "the best correlation is obtained when the  map is taken at the previous scanning position ( which is shifted 1.5 s in time ) , but the correlation is almost as good with the same position .",
    "this means that the differential refraction is present , but is below the size of the scanning step ( 035 ) .",
    "since both positions give very similar results , for the rest of the paper we compare the results for the  and  lines at the same scanning positions because this implies no temporal shift .",
    "we proceed to analyze the parameters resulting from the gaussian fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : ajuste ] shows the time - slit maps of the amplitudes , widths and displacements for the 1st scan position for both  ( top ) and  ( bottom ) lines .",
    "similar results are obtained for the rest of the scan positions .",
    "the contour lines ( same in all panels ) underline the locations selected under the criteria listed in section [ sect : selection ] .",
    "one can observe that the gaussian amplitude , which can be used as a proxy of the density of the plasma , is quite uniform in the emitting regions , with some higher values in specific knots .",
    "the doppler velocities show spatial and temporal correlations , with plasma flowing towards and away from us at a fixed slit position , depending on the time instant .",
    "the comparison between the time - slit maps shows that both lines originate from plasma with very similar dynamical conditions .",
    "the amplitudes of the lines ( left panels ) are coherent and show the same features , taking into account that the signal in the  line was much lower , meaning that we could not fit it confidently in those points with lower counts . regarding the line widths ( middle panels ) we also verify that there is a good agreement between the lines , taking into account that the thermal width ( assuming lte emission ) is related to the atomic number , so that the width of the  line is related to the width of the  line by a factor @xmath35",
    ". however , the most striking similarity appears in the doppler velocity ( right panels ) , where the same features can be identified in both lines .",
    "there are several dynamical processes that were taking place during the observations of the prominence .",
    "the slit was crossing the body of the prominence , while at some moments the jets from the nearby active region were contaminating at the line of sight .",
    "one can see in figure  [ fig : ajuste ] that there is strong evidence of wave behavior in the observed signal . since the information about the magnetic field vector is not available , it is hard to infer the type of wave .",
    "nevertheless , the wave parameters can be inferred rather reliably .",
    "the wave main period of the waves is around 3 min .",
    "the 3 min oscillations are present almost during all the observation at all the slit positions covering the prominence .",
    "the wavelength of oscillations appears to be larger that the whole observed prominence ( more than 60 ) , i.e. the whole body of the prominence is oscillating , although not necessarily in phase at all the parts .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations reaches 3  and the oscillations appear to be slightly non - linear .",
    "the oscillations continue without apparent damping during all the observation for more than half an hour .",
    "the active region close to the observed prominence showed some activity , with jets and plumes sometimes coming from it and crossing the slit .",
    "most of this activity lied in the other part of the slit not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] .",
    "however , at one instance we found evidence of one of these jets in the spectral information where prominence signal was also recorded .",
    "an example of such spectra is the pair @xmath29 from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the space - time evolution of the jet can be followed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] at time around 12 min and location between 60  and 70 .",
    "it can also be seen in the  slitjaw images.the line - of - sight velocity component is almost zero at the onset of the jet , but it becomes much higher at later stages , reaching over 50 .",
    "the jet is clearly seen in the red wing , and it accelerates as time passes until its amplitude vanishes without slowing down or reversing the velocity sign .",
    "in this section we compare in detail the velocities obtained from the  and  lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] . we assumed that the  line serves as a proxy of the movement of ionized species , while the  line is related to neutral species .",
    "the drift velocity is defined as the difference between the velocity of both lines , @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cuts ] provides examples of time and space cuts through the velocity maps from fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] for both spectral lines .",
    "the upper panels of this figure shows that the match between the velocities of the lines is extremely good .",
    "both lines follow closely each other and show the same displacements , with very little differences between them .",
    "nevertheless , at the instants of extreme velocities ( maxima and minima ) there is some difference in the behavior of both lines , with  velocities being slightly larger .",
    "we could not find evidences that the difference between  and  velocity follows the 3 min oscillations , as individual velocities do .",
    "the phase shift between the velocities of both lines is found to be around zero .",
    "similar behavior is also found when considering spatial variations at a fixed time ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] ) .",
    "there , one may observe similar patterns for both lines , with some hints that spatial variations of  velocities are slightly smoother .",
    "this is particularly evident at the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] where the gradients of  velocity are slightly more pronounced .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the time - slit map of the drift velocity @xmath36 for the same scan position as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] , obtained by directly subtracting the velocity maps from that figure .",
    "we set @xmath37 artificially to zero at locations that do not satisfy the selection criteria outlined in sect .",
    "[ sect : selection ] .",
    "the inspection of this figure confirms the conclusion already apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : ajuste ] that the difference between  and  velocities is small in most of the locations , taking into account the error bars .",
    "however , patches of blue and red colors are distinct , showing regions where the drift velocities are non - zero",
    ". typical values at those locations are in the range of @xmath38 .",
    "there are also patches where @xmath37 is positive and above 2  located at the left border of the structure visible in the image .",
    "the inspection of the line profiles of both lines at these locations reveal that they have some asymmetry .",
    "the latter may be a consequence of the line of sight velocity gradient at these locations , affecting the velocity measurements by the method adopted in this paper .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] shows the histogram of @xmath37 over all selected locations of the time - slit map and all scans ( solid line ) .",
    "the dotted line in the same figure is the histogram of the same quantity but with the opposite sign , shown for the purposes of highlighting the asymmetry of the distribution .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution of the relative velocity is slightly asymmetric , with its most probable value being slightly negative ( i.e.  velocity larger than  velocity ) , but with a more extended tail toward the larger positive values ( i.e. more locations where  velocity is significantly larger than  velocity ) .",
    "this histogram confirms the impression from fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] where we have observed that  shows larger extreme values of the velocity compared to .",
    "the average value of @xmath37 over all locations is very close to zero .",
    "we have verified whether the values of @xmath37 are affected by the opacity of the prominence material , i.e. if the difference in  and  velocity origins because the lines are not formed as exactly the same location .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] shows the bi - dimensional histogram of @xmath37 as a function of the ratio between the blue to red amplitudes of  profile , as an indicator of the opacity of the prominence .",
    "it reveals no dependence between both quantities .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , to the first order , the presence of non - zero @xmath37 is not due to line formation effects .",
    "we also checked whether there is a dependence between @xmath37 and any other line parameters , such as the doppler width , amplitude or displacement .",
    "the bi - dimensional histograms of the kind as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] reveal no such dependence for any of the quantities .",
    "nevertheless , the locations with non zero in @xmath39 are not randomly distributed over the time and space , but there is temporal and spatial coherence .",
    "the areas with non - zero @xmath37 cover about 2  in space and have a typical lifetimes around 1 minute .",
    "some of those areas may correspond to locations where jets contaminated the signal from the prominence at the field of view .",
    "despite we have tried to avoid the areas with multi - component profiles , it is still possible that the selection criteria used do not completely eliminate such locations .",
    "nevertheless , at other locations the one - component fit is reliable but still @xmath37 is non zero .",
    "this is the case in most of the time - slit map .",
    "we analyzed with more detail one of the regions in figure  [ fig : slits ] with reliable one - component fit .",
    "the spectra in this area have no significant second components , so the fits are quite reliable and the effect can not be attributed to problems in the fit .",
    "the plots show that there is part of the prominence with patches of non - zero drift velocity distributed coherently both across the slit ( with the typical the size of about 2@xmath403 ) and in time ( with lifetimes about @xmath41 minutes ) .",
    "the structures coherently evolve from one slit location to another .",
    "the fact that coherence is maintained only for short periods of time below one minute reinforce the necessity of the high time- and spatial resolution observations in order to reliably detect those drift velocities .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed high temporal and spatial resolution observations of a prominence done simultaneously in an ionized  line and a neutral  line .",
    "our analysis reveals that the structures observed with both lines are very similar indicating that they both form in essentially the same plasma volume .",
    "the velocities obtained from both lines are also very similar . at the same time",
    ", we obtained that there are small scale and small life time transients where the balance between both velocities is broken and drift velocity is observed . the balance is usually lost at places with large individual velocities or large spatial or temporal gradients . the magnitude of this drift velocity is below 1  in most of the locations where it is detected , and both positive and negative values of @xmath37 are measured , apparently unrelated to the dynamical processes ( such as wave motions ) that the prominence was undergoing during the time of observations .",
    "the patches with non - zero drift velocity are distributed coherently in time and space when carefully considering only cases with reliable one - component fit to the profiles .",
    "large drift velocities are also detected at locations where some jet from the nearby active region overlaps the observed field of view .",
    "however , at those locations , multi - component profiles are typical for one or both spectral lines , and the one - component fit becomes less reliable .",
    "those locations are nevertheless interesting and need further detailed investigation .",
    "there are several effects than may be responsible for the appearance of the mismatch between the velocities of both spectral lines . as mentioned in the introduction , in a partially ionized atmosphere , as collisions weaken , the ionized and the neutral plasma components become partially decoupled . the drift velocity given by eq .",
    "[ eq : w ] depends on currents , magnetic field and partial pressure gradients of the species .",
    "our finding from fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] that the mismatch between  and  velocities becomes more pronounced at locations with larger individual velocities and larger gradients may serve as a confirmation that the detected drift velocities are due to physical decoupling of the components by partial ionization effects .",
    "the fact that the patches are coherent over space and time , are short - lived and only occupy small areas also provides confirmation that the observed effect are due to some physical process rather than observational drawbacks .",
    "numerical simulations of prominence instabilities by @xcite show that similar amplitudes of the drift velocities are expected in the prominence - corona transition region .    other explanations for the mismatch between  and  velocities are also possible .",
    "one of the possible drawbacks of our approach is the uncertainty about the formation region of both spectral lines .",
    "the prominence material is frequently assumed to be optically thin .",
    "the ratio between the amplitudes of the blue and red components of  profile shows that the observed prominence plasma was indeed very close to optically thin , with some slight variations of the opacity in space in time .",
    "however , we have found no correlation between the amplitude ratio of the  components and the magnitude of the drift , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] . figure [ fig : ajuste ] demonstrates that the amplitudes and widths of both lines are well correlated , taking into account the fewer counts in the  line .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the velocity signal measured by both lines originates at essentially the same locations over most of the observed prominence .    we were able to detect drift velocities due to the very high temporal resolution of our observations .",
    "if the signal would be integrated over larger intervals , the effect apparent in figures [ fig : cuts ] , [ fig : hist ] and [ fig : slits ] would probably be lost or become much smaller .",
    "it is then expected that , if the resolution increases , the amplitudes of the ion - neutral velocity difference would become larger . in future works , it would be desirable to include more ionized and neutral spectral lines for the analysis in order to confirm the physical origin of the non - zero drift velocities measured in this work .",
