    ", supersymmetry may provide also the understanding of the origin of neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) models have been used as benchmarks to evaluate the potentiality for new discoveries at the current high energy colliders , such as the tevatron , and the future colliders , like the cern large hadron collider or the international linear collider .",
    "collider signals for supersymmetry have been studied both in the context of r  parity conservation  @xcite , as well as in scenarios with r  parity violation  @xcite .",
    "a variety of recent neutrino physics experiments  @xcite has established the existence of neutrino oscillations and masses , indicating clearly the need for physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is tempting to imagine that neutrino physics and supersymmetry are tied together  @xcite : susy models exhibiting r ",
    "parity violation can lead to a pattern of neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite in agreement with the current solar and reactor neutrino data as well as atmospheric and accelerator neutrino data .",
    "the simplest realization of this idea assumes bilinear violation of r ",
    "parity  @xcite .",
    "such restricted r ",
    "parity violation can arise either as an effective description of a spontaneous r  parity violation scenario  @xcite , or as a result of suitable symmetries of the underlying theory  @xcite .",
    "it also corresponds to the simplest broken r ",
    "parity version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , to which we refer , in what follows , as rmssm .    despite the presence of additional interactions in r",
    " parity violating supersymmetry , the susy particle production cross sections at colliders are essentially the same as in the mssm , since the smallness of neutrino masses implies small r  parity violation parameters .",
    "similarly , the susy particle cascade decays are controlled by r ",
    "parity conserving interactions until the lsp is produced .",
    "in contrast to r  parity conserving supersymmetry , the lsp is unstable in these models as it is not protected by any symmetry .",
    "in fact , r  parity violating interactions determine its branching ratios and can lead to large decay lengths and displaced vertices if these interactions are sufficiently small .",
    "parenthetically , let us mention that a light gravitino , as it occurs for example gauge mediated susy breaking , is a possible candidate for dark matter  @xcite . in case that the gravitino is heavy",
    ", dark matter must come from some other source , like the qcd ",
    "sector axion . in the light gravitino case displaced",
    "vertices discussed here should come from the r  parity violating nlsp decays which still have a large probability  @xcite . turning to the case of interest , namely the rmssm",
    ", it has been shown that in this case the lsp decay properties can be directly tested at collider experiments  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the possibility of the @xmath1 decay length being large enough to generate displaced vertices at the tevatron , which could be observed by the tracking systems of the experimental collaborations .",
    "we work within the framework of the simplest model of this kind , namely the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) version of the rmssm with universal soft breaking terms at unification  @xcite .",
    "we call it rmsugra , for short . however , here we are not enforcing universality conditions for r  parity violating soft terms . in such models one can show that over a large range of the accessible parameter space the masses of the sleptons , the lighter chargino ( @xmath2 ) , and the lighter neutralinos ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) are considerably smaller than the gluino and squark masses ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite and references therein . as a result ,",
    "at tevatron energies , the largest reach in supersymmetry searches comes from the production of charginos and neutralinos , and one might expect a copious number of displaced vertex events at the tevatron depending on the parameters of the model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the presence of bilinear r  parity violating ( brpv ) interactions enhances the discovery reach for supersymmetry over most of the parameter space with respect to the one obtained using the trilepton / multilepton signal  @xcite .",
    "previous analysis of the potential of the tevatron for probing neutrino mass models based on r  parity violation either analyzed the changes in the multilepton signal due to the lsp decay  @xcite or studied the same sign dilepton production presenting a displaced vertex due to the decay of a neutralino into @xmath4 or @xmath5 pairs  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these analyses were performed imposing only the constraints from atmospheric neutrino data . here , we analyzed events exhibiting two reconstructed displaced vertices and we scan the full accessible rmsugra parameter space at tevatron , taking into account all constraints coming from neutrino masses and mixing angles in the brpv model . we show that the predicted number of events at tevatron depends mainly on @xmath0 , or equivalently the neutralino mass , with mild dependences on the other msugra parameters or specific neutralino decay channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ model ] summarizes the most relevant features of the rmsugra model .",
    "the displaced vertex analysis is presented in section [ cuts ] , while we summarize our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "here we consider a simple variant of the mssm that includes the following bilinear terms in the superpotential  @xcite @xmath6 the relevant bilinear terms in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector are @xmath7 the simultaneous presence of the bilinear term in the superpotential and its analogue in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector violates r  parity and lepton number explicitly , inducing vacuum expectation values ( vev ) @xmath8 , @xmath9 for the sneutrinos . in order to reproduce the observed values of neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite we must have @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the susy bilinear mass parameter  @xcite .    in a minimal supergravity model with universal soft breaking terms at unification",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath12 where @xmath0 and @xmath13 are the common gaugino mass and scalar soft susy breaking masses at the unification scale , @xmath14 is the common trilinear term , and @xmath15 is the ratio between the higgs field vev s . although many parameterizations are possible , we take as the free parameters the @xmath16 of the superpotential and the so - called alignment parameters , @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , we are not enforcing universality conditions for r  parity violating soft terms .",
    "successful explanation of neutrino data requires small r  parity violating couplings .",
    "therefore , the induced shift in the susy masses by the brpv interactions is smaller than the foreseeable experimental accuracy , and thus , we use the following strategy : for a given set of the r  parity conserving parameters we calculate the mass spectrum setting the r  parity violating parameters to zero when evolving the parameters from the unification scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "this procedure was carried out using the package spheno ; details of this calculation can be found in  @xcite . at the electroweak scale",
    "we choose the r  parity violating parameters such that the neutrino data are successfully explained within the @xmath18 range as given,_e.g .",
    "_  in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath19 in order to obtain the mixing matrices between sm and susy particles we diagonalize the corresponding mass matrices containing sm and susy fermions and scalars , for instance , the full @xmath20 mass matrix for neutrinos and neutralinos .",
    "afterwards all susy r  parity violating as well as r  parity conserving decays are calculated using an adapted version of spheno .",
    "the output of this calculation is tabulated in the slha format  @xcite and inputed into pythia  @xcite , which is used to generate the events .",
    "we studied the scenarios where the lsp is the lightest neutralino which decays into sm particles due to the mixings induced by the brpv interactions .",
    "the lightest neutralino has leptonic decays @xmath21 , the invisible mode @xmath22 and semi - leptonic decays @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite . as an illustration , we depict in fig.[fig : br ] the lightest neutralino branching ratios as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . in this plot we took the r  parity violating parameters for each msugra point that lead to the largest decay length compatible with neutrino data at the @xmath18 level .",
    "as we can see from this figure , the decay @xmath29 dominates at small @xmath13 .",
    "this decay channel arises from an effective coupling @xmath30 , induced by the higgs - slepton mixing , where @xmath31 is the bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "therefore , this decay is enhanced at small @xmath13 due to the lightness of the scalars mediating it and at large @xmath15 due to enhanced yukawa couplings . moreover , at large @xmath13 all @xmath1 decay channels give a sizeable contribution with the main decay modes being the semi - leptonic ones exhibiting light quarks .",
    "the expected @xmath1 lifetime ( decay length ) depends both on the magnitude of r ",
    "parity breaking parameters and the chosen values of the msugra parameters .",
    "the smallness of the r  parity violating parameters implies that the lightest neutralino has a small decay width  @xcite , thus having a lifetime large enough to give rise to displaced vertices . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpath ] we depict the lightest neutralino decay length as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath32 100 , 200 , and 1000 gev and @xmath26 , @xmath33 , @xmath28 . in this figure , we varied the r  parity violating parameters so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 lie in the @xmath18 bands required to account for the neutrino oscillation data  @xcite . note from fig.[fig : dpath ] that the lsp decay length strongly depends on @xmath13 , as it controls the masses of the scalar particles exchanged in the lsp decay . in contrast , the dependence on @xmath14 is rather mild .",
    "one can see from this figure that the lsp decay length is in the range of tenths of mm up to @xmath36 cm .",
    "therefore , the lightest neutralino should decay inside the detectors of tevatron yielding an observable displaced vertex .",
    "in the context of our rmssm / rmsugra , supersymmetric particle production and subsequent cascade decays proceed as in the r  parity conserving case ( mssm / msugra ) up to the final state containing two lightest neutralinos , as mentioned above . since neutrino data require the r  parity violating couplings to be small , the decays of these two neutralinos leads , in general , to displaced vertices  @xcite . assuming that gluinos and squarks are too heavy to be produced at the tevatron , the most important susy production processes at the tevatron are @xmath37    the main decay modes of the lightest neutralino in our model are    * @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath11 denoted by @xmath40 ; * @xmath41 denoted @xmath42 ; * @xmath43 , called @xmath44 ; * @xmath29 , that we denote by @xmath45 ; * @xmath46 , called @xmath47 ; * @xmath48 , called @xmath49 .",
    "in order to mimic the triggers used by the tevatron collaborations , we accept events passing at least one of the following requirements :    1 .",
    "the event has two muons with transverse momenta satisfying @xmath50 gev ; 2 .",
    "the event possesses a lepton ( electron or muon ) with @xmath51 gev and a displaced track with an impact parameter in excess of 0.120 mm and @xmath52 gev ; 3 .",
    "the event exhibits two displaced tracks of opposite charge with @xmath53 gev and impact parameter larger than 0.120 mm .    in the @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 decays , the tracks point to the lsp decay vertex , up to measurement errors . in our analysis",
    "we smeared the energies , but not directions , of all final state particles with a gaussian error given by @xmath54 ( @xmath55 in gev ) for hadrons and @xmath56 for charged leptons .",
    "therefore , the lsp decay vertex is reconstructed correctly for these modes within these approximations . on the other hand , the tracks originating from the @xmath47 and @xmath49 decay modes do not converge to the lsp decay vertex . for these events we looked for tracks that do not point to the interaction region and whose",
    "reconstructed trajectories come closer than @xmath57 m",
    "( @xmath58 m ) if the closest point of the two trajectories are inside the silicon detector ( central tracker ) . in this case",
    ", we defined the position of the displaced vertex as the average of the closest points of the two trajectories .    in our analysis , we also required that the two reconstructed vertices are away from the interaction point , more specifically , we demanded that both lsp decay vertices lie outside an ellipsoid @xmath59 where the @xmath60-axis is along the beam direction .",
    "we assumed that @xmath61 m and @xmath62 m .    to guarantee a high efficiency in the reconstruction of the displaced vertices without a full detector simulation , we restricted our analysis to reconstructed vertices with pseudo - rapidities @xmath63 . moreover",
    ", both neutralinos should decay well inside the inner detectors to guarantee enough hits in the track system .",
    "therefore , we require that the neutralinos decay inside a cylinder with radius @xmath64 mm and length @xmath65 mm .",
    "the sm backgrounds coming , for instance , from displaced vertices associated to @xmath66 s or @xmath67 s can be eliminated by requiring that the set of tracks defining a displaced vertex should have an invariant mass larger than 20  gev .",
    "this way the displaced vertex signal passing all the above cuts is essentially background free .",
    "[ fig : minva ] displays the reconstructed invariant mass of displaced vertices after cuts for @xmath68 gev , @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath69 taking the largest value compatible with neutrino data .",
    "as we can see , the neutralino decays lead to a substantial invariant mass associated to the displaced vertices . if necessary",
    ", the invariant mass can be further tightened without a substantial loss of signal .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : nevdl ] the expected number of events ( @xmath70 ) after the above cuts as function of the neutralino decay length for various values of @xmath13 and @xmath0 and an integrated luminosity of 8 fb@xmath71 . in this plot",
    "we chose the r  parity violating parameters such that the largest decay length is obtained compatible with neutrino data at the @xmath18 level .",
    "the same plot for smaller decay lengths is basically the same but with a shift of large @xmath13 values to the left side .",
    "for example , for the point with @xmath72gev we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 mm and @xmath75 , while for smaller value of @xmath76 for the same sugra point , we find @xmath77 18.4 and @xmath78 mm . in general ,",
    "the variation of the number of events at any sugra point is of order 10% for the full range for the r  parity parameters compatible with neutrino data .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the decay length is mainly determined by the values of the neutrino masses which are already known rather precisely .    in order to illustrate the behavior of the signal for a fixed value of @xmath13 we present , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nevdl0100 ] , the expected number of events for the same parameters as in fig .  [ fig : nevdl ] but for fixed @xmath79 gev .",
    "the numbers given beside some points indicate the corresponding value of @xmath0 . at small decay lengths ( @xmath80 mm )",
    "the production cross section of neutralinos is rather low , as well as the efficiency for extracting the signal . as the decay length increases",
    ", @xmath0 ( @xmath81 ) decreases and the production cross section increases , however , the detection efficiency reaches a maximum around @xmath82 mm and then decreases again .",
    "these two opposite behaviors lead to an approximately constant signal rate for decay lengths @xmath83 mm .",
    "we are now set to study the discovery reach of the tevatron using the displaced vertex signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach ] we show the region of the @xmath84 plane where the displaced vertex signal can be established at tevatron for integrated luminosities @xmath85 of 2 fb@xmath71 and 8 fb@xmath71 and fixed values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath86 .",
    "our conventions are as follows : in the points below the solid line the expected number of events ( @xmath70 ) is greater than 4 , while the region below the dashed line exhibits a sizeable statistics ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the black squares denote points with an expected number of events greater than 4 for an integrated luminosity of 8 @xmath88 , while the grey ( green ) squares indicates the points presenting a high statistics ( @xmath87 ) for this luminosity .",
    "moreover , points denoted by diamonds have @xmath89 with 8 @xmath88 , while the stars correspond to points with @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the present direct search limits are violated at the points indicated with a round black circle , while the white circles mark the points where the neutralino is no longer the lsp but the lighter stau .",
    "the stau is to short - lived to produce a visible decay length as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore a different analysis is required for such cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](a ) , top - left panel , we present the tevatron reach for @xmath92 gev , @xmath93 and @xmath27 , taking the the r  parity violating parameters such that we obtain the largest decay length for the lightest neutralino and being at the same time compatible at 3@xmath94 level with the present neutrino data .",
    "we see from this figure that the tevatron with 2 fb@xmath71 integrated luminosity is able to probe @xmath95 gev at moderate and large values of @xmath13 . at small values of @xmath13 , where the decay lengths are smaller and",
    "the main decay channel is @xmath96 , the tevatron can probe well the region @xmath97 gev .",
    "this reach is larger than the one provided by trilepton and multilepton searches @xcite .",
    "moreover , for @xmath98 gev and @xmath99 gev we expect a large number of events , which can not only make the discovery easy , but also be used to perform preliminary studies of the neutralino branching ratios and confront them with the predictions of our model .",
    "the tevatron reach can be considerably extended provided larger integrated luminosities become available , for instance , the region @xmath100 gev and large values of @xmath13 can be explored for @xmath101 fb@xmath71 with the region @xmath102 gev exhibiting a large statistics .    in order to understand the effect of different choices of the r  parity violating parameters , we present in fig .  [ fig : reach](b ) , top - right panel , the tevatron reach for r  parity violating parameters leading to a minimal decay length of the lightest neutralino compatible with neutrino data while keeping the r - parity conserving parameters fixed . as expected from the previous discussion ,",
    "the reach is in both cases rather similar .    to study how our results depend upon @xmath14 , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](c ) , lower - left panel , the displaced vertex discovery reach at the tevatron for @xmath103 gev and all other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](a ) and the r  parity violating parameters such that the neutralino decay length is maximized .",
    "the changes in the predicted number of events are again at the level of a few percent which leads to slightly smaller tevatron reach .",
    "furthermore , there is a region with a stau lsp which can not be covered by the present analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](d ) the msugra parameters are chosen as in ( a ) but with @xmath104 .",
    "again we have chosen the r  parity violating parameters such that the neutralino decay length is maximized .",
    "as we can see , the tevatron reach increases at moderate @xmath13 , remaining approximately the same at large @xmath13 .",
    "as in the previous case , fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](c ) , the stau is the lsp at small @xmath13 and thus this region is not covered by our analysis .",
    "we can learn from the fig .",
    "[ fig : reach ] panels that the displaced vertex signal remains approximately stable , showing that this channel depends mainly upon @xmath0 and hardly on the other parameters , including the r  parity violating ones provided they are in the range allowed by neutrino data .",
    "this is at variance with the behavior of the trilepton and multilepton signals for our r  parity violating sugra model  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the decay length depends , in addition to @xmath105 , mainly upon the two ratios @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which are constrained to lie in narrow ranges by the neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : br ] , the neutralino branching ratios into different allowed channels exhibits a much stronger dependence on the rmsugra parameters @xcite being , therefore , less robust .    for illustrative purpose only , as the maximum luminosity expected for the tevatron run - ii will be at most 8@xmath108 , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:25fb-1 ] the expected reach in the displaced vertex channel assuming an integrated luminosity of 25 fb@xmath71 in order to allow easier comparison with the tevatron reach of the trilepton signal in the mssm  @xcite and the trilepton and multilepton signals with rmsugra obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing the last two signals we learn that the presence of r  parity violation enhances the tevatron",
    "reach over most of the parameter space , specially at moderate and large @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the reach in @xmath0 of the displaced vertex signal is more than twice the one of the trilepton and multilepton signals for basically all values of @xmath13 and @xmath15 .    despite the large reach of the two - displaced - vertices channel , it is interesting to study whether we can further enlarge the tevatron sensitivity to rmsugra .",
    "one possible way to achieve this goal is to consider events containing one or more displaced vertices @xcite that pass our selection cuts instead of requiring two displaced vertices .",
    "we depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] the tevatron reach requiring at least one reconstructed vertex in the events for the same choice of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach](a ) . as we can see",
    ", the reach in @xmath0 can be extended in 50 gev in accordance with ref .",
    "however , this results should be taken with a pinch of salt since it is not obvious that our cuts eliminate completely the sm backgrounds when there is just one observed displaced vertex .",
    "to verify this result a detailed detector simulation is called for .",
    "we have analyzed displaced vertices from neutralino decays in a supergravity model with violation of r  parity ( rmsugra ) at the fermilab tevatron . in this model r  parity",
    "is violated effectively by bilinear terms in the superpotential and soft supersymmetry breaking sector . despite the small r  parity violating couplings needed to generate the neutrino masses and mixings indicated by current neutrino data",
    ", the lightest supersymmetric particle can decay inside the detector .",
    "this leads to a phenomenology quite distinct from that of the r  parity conserving scenario . we have quantified the tevatron reach for the displaced vertices signal , displaying our results in the @xmath84 plane .",
    "in contrast with other studies @xcite , we have a background free signal with a very stable yield which depends mainly on the neutralino mass .",
    "this follows from our requirement of two displaced vertices instead of only one @xcite , and the fact that we imposed all constraints of the neutrino data on the rmsugra parameters .",
    "in fact , even for @xmath109  gev ( @xmath110  gev ) , and moderate to high @xmath13 values , a few events are expected for an integrated luminosity of 8 fb@xmath111 , with a minor dependence in other rmsugra parameters .",
    "this reach is considerably larger than the one in the trilepton / multilepton channels in either the mssm or rmsugra .",
    "therefore , the displaced - vertices signal is an essential tool to extend considerable the search possibilities of tevatron in the case of broken r  parity .",
