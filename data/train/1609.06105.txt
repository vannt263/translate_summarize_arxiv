    "in addition , one may speculate whether the unusual temperature dependence of the specific heat , i.e. a field - independent hump - like region in the ordered phase , is associated with the interplay of anisotropy and energetically neighboring states , too .",
    "very recently , the ground state at @xmath9 was found to exhibit a small tilting from the ( 110 ) plane in the spin - spiral plane .",
    "@xcite it is speculated that this tilting could arise from a small angle between the direction of the anisotropy and the [ 001]-axis .",
    "we note , that the hf - esr data presented here probe the magnetic phase above @xmath165  t.    finally , our results imply short - range magnetic correlations well above @xmath2  as consistently indicated by the shift of hf - esr resonance fields below @xmath166  k , the failure of a power law description in the lf - esr data , and the observation of magnetic entropy changes at temperatures well above @xmath2 .",
    "such a wide range of antiferromagnetic fluctuations agrees to the structurally triangular , @xmath167 magnetically frustrated arrangement of mn@xmath11-ions in mnsb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the failure to describe the lf - esr linewidth in terms of a single power - law may indicate dimensional crossover when approaching the chiral magnetic ground state .",
    "to summarize , we report the static and dynamic magnetic properties as well as specific heat of structurally and magnetically chiral mnsb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram shows competing antiferromagnetic phases at small magnetic fields , i.e. at @xmath6  @xmath7 0.5  t and @xmath8  = 0.9  t. the afmr modes imply planar anisotropy which qualitatively confirms recent predictions .",
    "@xcite the data are well described by means of an easy - plane two - sublattice model with the anisotropy field @xmath3  t. the exchange field @xmath168  t is obtained from the saturation field of the static magnetization .",
    "the results are discussed in terms of a delicate balance of cycloidal and helical spin structures under the influence of small planar anisotropy and external magnetic field .",
    "the frustrated nature of the system is reflected by the fact that short - range magnetic correlations are observed well above @xmath2 .",
