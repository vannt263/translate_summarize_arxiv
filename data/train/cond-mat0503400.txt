    "many years ago , steven weinberg mentioned to me that he was disconcerted that none of the classic textbooks on superconductivity would explain the phenomenon in terms of the higgs mechanism  @xcite for the electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "this concern is of course very well justified , and it was most likely with this concern in mind that weinberg has included a section on superconductivity in his treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism in his series of volumes entitled _ the quantum theory of fields _  @xcite .",
    "when i was asked recently to present some lectures on superconductivity , i opened his book expecting to find a particularly lucid exposition of this in condensed matter physics rarely emphasized perspective .",
    "i found the exposition i was looking for , but to my surprise , build around the following statement : _ a superconductor is simply a material in which electromagnetic gauge invariance is spontaneously broken .",
    "_ what weinberg means with this statement is just that the electromagnetic gauge field `` acquires a mass '' due to the higgs mechanism in a superconductor , as particle physicists often speak of spontaneously broken gauge invariance interchangeably with the higgs mechanism .",
    "nonetheless , i am not perfectly at ease with the above statement , which is , by the way , by no means specific to weinberg s exposition , but widely believed and accepted .",
    "while it is obvious that weinberg fully understands the matter , the statement may still be misleading to a young student who is learning the subject for the first time .",
    "the problem is that the statement is , if one takes it literally , not correct : gauge invariance can not spontaneously break down as a matter of principle , and in particular is not broken in a superconductor , as i will explain in the following section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : gau ] , we discuss the statement quoted above including the danger which may result from a literal interpretation of it in depth .",
    "in particular , we show that the bcs ground state is , in contrast to statements made in the literature , fully gauge invariant .",
    "the crucial ingredient often omitted is that gauge transformations involve , in addition to the standard transformation of gauge fields , local phase rotations of _ both _ creation ( and annihilation ) operators _ and _ wave functions . in section",
    "[ sec : ord ] , we discuss the nature of the order parameter in superconductors , with a particular emphasis on finite systems , which always possess a unique ground state . the arising subtlety is explained by drawing an analogy to quantum antiferromagnets , which also possess a unique and rotationally invariant ground state for finite systems . in section  [ sec : eff ] , we motivate and elaborate the effective field theory of a superconductor at low temperatures , which contains the theory of a neutral superfluid as the special case where the charge is set to zero .",
    "in particular , we obtain the particle density and current as well as the energy and momentum density from the physical symmetries of the theory , invariance under global u(1 ) phase rotations of the order parameter and invariance under translations in time and space . the quest for a consistent definition of the superfluid velocity",
    "yields a relation between current and momentum densities in the superfluid , which in turn requires corrections to the effective lagrangian . since the density of the superfluid is essentially the `` momentum conjugate '' of the order parameter phase , hamilton s equations yield physical information not contained in the euler ",
    "lagrange equations ; specifically , we obtain a gauge invariant generalization of anderson s characteristic equations of superfluidity to the case of superconductors .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief justification of the classical nature of the effective field theory . in section",
    "[ sec : phe ] , we discuss the phenomenology of superconductors as compared to neutral superfluids , or , in general terms , the higgs mechanism .",
    "to begin with , we briefly address the phenomenology of neutral superfluids including vortex quantization , and give a general introduction to the higgs mechanism in field theories .",
    "we then turn to the phenomenology of simply connected superconductors , solve the equations of motion , obtain electric and magnetic screening , london s equation , the bernoulli hall effect , and the balance of the lorentz force .",
    "we demonstrate that the higgs mechanism never corresponds to a spontaneous violation of a gauge symmetry , and that it is incorrect to interpret it in terms of `` a mass acquired by the electromagnetic gauge field '' , as the massive field is no longer a gauge field .",
    "specifically , we show that the massive vector field , which may alternatively be used to describe a ( simply connected ) superconductor , is correctly interpreted as a four - vector formed by the chemical potential and the three components of the superfluid velocity .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the subtle difference between the physical invariance of the theory under global u(1 ) rotations of the order parameter phase and gauge invariance , which is nothing but a local invariance of our description of the system . in the last section",
    ", we review a family of `` quantum effects '' : the quantization of magnetic flux in superconductors , phase slippage , and the josephson effect in both neutral superfluids and superconductors .",
    "in these effects , planck s constant manifests itself in the phenomenology through the compactness of the order parameter phase field ; these effects require either a non - trivial topology or more than one superfluid .",
    "we derive them from the effective field theory introduced in section  [ sec : eff ] , and thereby demonstrate that the very few assumptions made in motivating the effective theory are sufficient to account for them .",
    "to illustrate how dangerous the statement quoted in the introduction is in the case of superconductivity , where we do not only have a description in terms of an effective field theory but also a microscopic description in terms of model hamiltonians and trial wave functions , i will at first assume the statement was true and take it literally .",
    "i will pretend to be a student who has just learned that electromagnetic gauge invariance is spontaneously violated in a superconductor .",
    "well , what does this mean ?",
    "a spontaneously broken symmetry means that the hamiltonian of a given system in the thermodynamic limit is invariant under a given symmetry transformation ( commutes with the generator(s ) of this symmetry ) while the ground state is not invariant .",
    "there are many ground states , which transform into each other under the symmetry transformations .",
    "a classic example is ferromagnetism : the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant , while any particular ground state , specified by the direction the magnetization vector points to , is not .",
    "so if gauge invariance is broken in a superconductor , this must mean that the ground state of the superconductor does not share the gauge invariance of the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , a glance at the bcs wave function  @xcite @xmath0 where the coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are chosen real and @xmath3 is an arbitrary phase , appears to confirm this picture .",
    "there are many different ground state wave functions , labeled by @xmath3 , which transform into each other under an electromagnetic gauge transformation given by @xmath4 which is tantamount to taking @xmath5 for simplicity , we have chosen @xmath6 independent of spacetime .",
    "the electron charge throughout this article is @xmath7 .",
    "next , i the student ask myself whether these many bcs wave functions for different parameters @xmath3 correspond to physically different states .",
    "i know that gauge transformations are not physical transformations : gauge invariance is an invariance of a description of a system , while other symmetries correspond to invariances under physical transformations , like rotations or translations , which affect the physical state in question .",
    "for example , if the hamiltonian for given system ( like a ferromagnet ) is invariant under rotations in space , this implies that if we rotate a given eigenstate , we will obtain another eigenstate . depending on whether the original state is rotationally invariant or",
    "not , it will transform into itself or into a physically different state . a gauge transformation , by contrast ,",
    "will only transform our description of a system from one gauge to another , without ever having any effect on the physical state of the system .",
    "gauge transformations are comparable to rotations or translations of the coordinate system we use to describe a system .",
    "another way of seeing the difference is by noting that it is possible to rotate or translate a superconductor in the laboratory , but as a matter of principle not possible to gauge transform it .",
    "returning to the superconductor , i the student conclude that if the many different ground states only differ by a gauge transformation , they can not be physically different",
    ". the ground state of a superconductor must hence be physically unique .",
    "in fact , there is another way of looking at the problem which appears to confirm this conclusion .",
    "a bcs superconductor can not only be described in the grand - canonical ensemble , where the chemical potential rather than the number of particles is fixed , but also in the canonical ensemble , where the number of particles or pairs is fixed . following anderson  @xcite",
    ", we can project out a ( not normalized ) state with @xmath8 pairs from ( [ e : bcs ] ) via @xmath9 and obtain ( see appendix ) @xmath10 where the real - space creation operator fields @xmath11 are simply the fourier transforms of the momentum - space creation operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 the wave function for each of the individual pairs , which only depends on the relative coordinate , is ( up to a normalization ) given by @xmath14 this form nicely illustrates that all the pairs have condensed into the same state , which is the essence of superfluidity .",
    "as @xmath15 is uniquely determined for a given hamiltonian , the ground state of the superconductor ( [ e : bcsn ] ) once more appears to be unique and non - degenerate .",
    "so far the students train of thought .",
    "the conclusion reached is of course completely wrong : a superfluid , and in particular a superconductor , is characterized by a spontaneously broken symmetry , and , at least in the thermodynamic limit , there are many degenerate ground states .",
    "there are several mistakes in the students analysis .",
    "the first is his literal interpretation of the statement quoted in the inroduction .",
    "in fact , _ a gauge symmetry can not spontaneously break down as a matter of principle , since it is not a physical symmetry of the system to begin with , but merely an invariance of description _  @xcite .",
    "the only way to violate a gauge symmetry is by choosing a gauge , which again has only an effect on our description , but not on the physical system itself .",
    "in particular , the bcs ground state does not violate gauge invariance , even though statements to the contrary have been made in the literature .",
    "the apparent contradiction with ( [ e : bcs ] ) and ( [ e : gaugec ] ) can be resolved by recalling that a gauge transformation only affects our description of the system , and is analogous to a rotation of the coordinate system we use in the example of a ferromagnet : if we rotate the coordinate system accordingly , a ground state with the magnetization vector pointing in the @xmath16-direction in the original coordinate system will `` transform '' into a state with the magnetization vector pointing in the @xmath17-direction in the new coordinate system , while the physical state has not been affected at all .",
    "so while the bcs wave function may look different in a different gauge , the state itself will remain the same .",
    "it is worthwhile to rephrase this statement in equations . to begin with ,",
    "let us consider a ( relativistic quantum ) field theory .",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance is the invariance of a given theory under u(1 ) rotations of the complex scalar fields which carry the charge : @xmath18 where @xmath17 denotes spacetime .",
    "we use the conventions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . if the theory contains gradient terms in these fields ( as it usually does )",
    ", gauge invariance demands that they are minimally coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field , the gradient terms must enter the lagrangian as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath24 must transform according to @xmath25 the statement that the theory is gauge invariant simply means that the lagrangian is invariant under the combined transformation ( [ e : gaugeprel ] ) and ( [ e : gaugearel ] ) .",
    "it is not a physical invariance , but an invariance of description , as it only amounts to a reparametrization of fields .",
    "the concept of gauge invariance is implemented in a very similar way in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , where the gauge field @xmath26 is no longer considered a dynamical variable , but an externally applied vector potential , and we usually do not describe a system by a lagrange density , but by a hamiltonian operator and its eigenstates . for pedagogical reasons , let us first assume a formulation in second quantization .",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance means once again that the description is invariant under u(1 ) rotations of the particle creation and annihilation operator fields  @xcite , @xmath27 the kinetic part of the hamiltonian will again contain gradient terms in the operator fields , which once again must be minimally coupled to the electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "for example , the standard kinetic hamiltonian for a quadratic dispersion @xmath28 is obviously invariant under ( [ e : gaugep ] ) provided we transform the gauge field simultaneously according to @xmath29 let us now turn to the gauge transformation properties of the eigenstates .",
    "consider a general @xmath8 electron eigenstate @xmath30 the state is invariant under ( [ e : gaugep ] ) provided we transform the wave function according to @xmath31 this already illustrates the statement phrased in words above : a gauge transformation leaves physical states invariant .",
    "this is just not obvious in every formulation .",
    "if we formulate a problem in non - relativistic quantum mechanics in first quantization , a gauge transformation will only amount to ( [ e : gaugea ] ) and ( [ e : gaugepsi ] ) , as we do not even introduce the operator fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "as @xmath34 implements an externally applied magnetic field , we must choose a gauge in order to obtain explicit expressions for the hamiltonian and the eigenstates .",
    "the vector potential and the wave functions will have different functional forms in different gauges . the gauge rotations ( [ e : gaugep ] ) of the particle creation and annihilation operators , by contrast , only amount to a local change of variables ; we could write @xmath35 and then simply omit the primes .",
    "this part of the gauge transformation is often omitted as a choice of convention .    in the case of a bcs superconductor , such a convention would be all but propitious , as it would suggests that the ground state is not gauge invariant .",
    "the apparent contradiction in the students train of thought is immediately resolved as one uses the full and correct prescription for a gauge transformation , @xmath36 where the transformation of the phase @xmath3 is the equivalent of ( [ e : gaugepsi ] ) above . then the bcs ground state @xmath37 is evidently gauge invariant ; it is merely the label @xmath3 in @xmath38 which will be adjusted under a gauge transformation .",
    "the transformation @xmath39 is also required for the classical ( or ginzburg  landau ) order parameter field @xmath40 , which is given by the expectation value of the operator field @xmath41 to have to the correct gauge transformation properties . for the bcs ground state , @xmath42 will transform as a field of charge @xmath43 under ( [ e : gaugecc ] ) , @xmath44 this is the physically correct prescription .",
    "when we couple @xmath40 minimally to the electromagnetic gauge field , as required by ( [ e : opgauge ] ) , we obtain the correct effective field theory description of superconductivity .",
    "this theory displays the higgs mechanism and yields london s equation .",
    "( by contrast , if we were to adhere to ( [ e : gaugec ] ) , @xmath40 would be invariant , could not be coupled to the electromagnetic gauge field , and no sensible effective field theory could be formulated . )",
    "before proceeding further with the higgs mechanism , i would like to return to the students train of thought and explain what is wrong with his conclusion drawn from the bcs wave function in position space .",
    "the problem here is that while the ground state is indeed unique for a finite system , there are many degenerate states in the thermodynamic limit , which correspond to different numbers of particles . to understand this issue in depth ,",
    "it is best to first recall how rotational symmetry is spontaneously violated in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets . as a minimal model , we consider a three dimensional cubic lattice of spins with spin quantum number @xmath45 and assume the heisenberg hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath46 where the sum extends over all nearest - neighbor bonds @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) for a ferromagnet ( an antiferromagnet ) .    in the case of a ferromagnet",
    ", the order parameter is given by the total spin operator @xmath50 where the sum extends over all lattice sites .",
    "it commutes with the hamiltonian , @xmath51}=0,\\ ] ] and it is hence possible to choose simultaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the order parameter . in other words , the degenerate eigenstates of the order parameter corresponding to all possible directions the magnetization vector @xmath52 can point to , are simultaneously degenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "( for a ferromagnet with @xmath8 spins , all the spins align and the ground states are just the states with maximal total spin @xmath53 . ) the ground state of the hamiltonian is vastly ( @xmath54 fold ) degenerate even if the system is finite .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the antiferromagnet .",
    "the order parameter is given by the nel vector , which in operator form is given by @xmath55 where a and b denote the two sublattices of the ( bipartite ) cubic lattice .",
    "it does _ not _ commute with the hamiltonian : @xmath56}\\ne 0.\\ ] ] this implies that we can not choose simultaneous eigenstates for the hamiltonian and the order parameter .",
    "in fact , a theorem due to marshall  @xcite states that the ground state for @xmath8 even is unique and a spin singlet , or in other words , rotationally invariant .",
    "( it is possible to choose simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath57 and @xmath58 as ( [ e : commstot ] ) holds independently of the sign of @xmath59 . )",
    "the classical nel order parameter , @xmath60 will vanish for any finite system .",
    "this is not to say that there is no order for a finite system ; it just manifests itself only through long - range correlations in the staggered spin - spin correlation function : @xmath61 where the @xmath62 sign applies for @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the same sublattice , the @xmath65 sign for @xmath63 and @xmath64 on different sublattices , and @xmath66 is understood to denote a very large separation within ( the finite volume of ) the system .",
    "as we approach the thermodynamic limit , the difference in energy between the lowest singlet and lowest eigenstates for @xmath67 vanishes , and the ground state becomes degenerate ( see fig .",
    "[ f : spec]a ) .",
    "these degenerate states can now be classified by the directions of the nel vector @xmath68 , and the spontaneous breakdown of rotation symmetry is evident .",
    "the situation in superconductors is analogous to the antiferromagnet : the ( operator valued ) order parameter ( [ e : op ] ) does not commute with the bcs hamiltonian for any finite system even if we work in the grand - canonical ensemble , and the ground state for any finite volume will have a well defined particle number . the difference in energy between a system with @xmath8 or @xmath69 or @xmath70 _ etc . _  pairs , however , will vanish in the thermodynamic limit ( see , and the many degenerate ground states can be classified by the phase @xmath3 of the ( classical ) order parameter @xmath71 the broken symmetry is of course also present in a system with a fixed number of particles , but like in the case of the antiferromagnet , only as a long - range correlation of the ( operator valued ) order parameter field : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is simply the hermitian conjugate of @xmath74 . this correlation is referred to as off diagonal long - range order ( odlro )  @xcite .",
    "this type of order is characteristic to all superfluids , whether charged ( like a superconductor ) or neutral ( like liquid helium ) , whether fermionic ( like a superconductor or @xmath75he ) or bosonic ( like @xmath76he ) . for a bosonic superfluid , the ( operator valued ) order parameter @xmath74 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath77 no longer create or annihilate a pair of fermions , but simply create or annihilate a single boson ( like a @xmath76he atom ) .",
    "the odlro is already evident from the position space wave function ( [ e : bcsn ] ) : since all the pairs have condensed into the same quantum state , which is translationally invariant as it does not depend on the center - of - mass coordinates of the pairs , we expect to obtain a finite overlap with the original ground state if we rather clumsily ( via @xmath78 ) remove a pair of particles at some location @xmath79 and equally clumsily ( via @xmath74 ) recreate it at a distant location @xmath80 . in a superfluid or superconductor with a fixed number of particles , the phase @xmath3 will align over the entire system , like the direction of the staggered magnetization or nel vector will align in an antiferromagnet .    to illustrate the significance of the phase once more ,",
    "let us consider a large ( but finite ) superconductor a , and describe it as a combination of two superconductors b and c :    ( 180,40)(-90,-20 ) ( -55,-16 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''",
    "( 55,-16 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( -55 , 16 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( 55 , 16 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( -90,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( -20,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( 20,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( 62,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( 90,0 )    ( 0,0 )    ' '' ''    ( 0 , 0)(0,0)@xmath81 ( -55 , 0)(0,0)a ( 41 , 0)(0,0)b ( 76 , 0)(0,0)c    if we label the ground states of each superconductor by its phase , we can obviously write @xmath82 as the phase @xmath3 of the order parameter will align over the entire system . if we now transform to a description in terms of fixed numbers of pairs @xmath83 for each superconductor , @xmath84 where @xmath85 can be a , b , or c , the ground state of a is no longer a direct product of the ground states of b and c : @xmath86 no matter how we choose @xmath87 , as the phases no longer align .",
    "so while it is possible to describe a superconductor in a canonical ensemble ( with fixed particle number ) , it is highly awkward to do so .",
    "it is comparable to a description of an antiferromagnet with long - range nel order in terms of an overall singlet ground state of the system .",
    "the most significant difference between an antiferromagnet and a superfluid or superconductor with regard to the order parameter is that the broken rotational symmetry in the former case is much more evident to us , as all the macroscopic objects in our daily life experience violate rotational symmetry at one level or another .",
    "in particular , the structure of the material in which antiferromagnetic order occurs provides us already with a reference frame for the direction the nel order parameter may point to . in the case of the superconductor , we need a second superconductor to have a reference direction for the phase , and an interaction between the order parameter in both superconductors to detect a relative difference in the phases .",
    "( in practice , such an interaction may be accomplished by a pair tunneling or so - called josephson junction . )",
    "the interference experiments will of course only be sensitive to the relative phase , and not the absolute phase in any of the superconductors , as all phases can , as a matter of principle , only be specified relative to some reference phase . in principle , the same is true for rotational invariance , but in this case the fixed stars provide us with a reference frame we perceive as `` absolute '' .",
    "we may conclude at this point that in a superfluid or superconductor , a symmetry is spontaneously violated , but this symmetry is _ not _ gauge invariance , but global u(1 ) phase rotation symmetry .",
    "this is already evident from the fact that the discussion above made no reference to whether the order parameter field @xmath74 is charged or not , and equally well applies to neutral superfluids , where @xmath74 carries no charge .",
    "there is , however , a very important difference between these two cases .",
    "if the order parameter field is neutral , the excitation spectrum of the system contains a gapless ( or in the language of particle physics `` massless '' ) mode , a so - called goldstone boson  @xcite , which physically corresponds to very slow spatial variations in the direction ( as for the case of broken rotational invariance ) or phase ( as for the case of a superfluid ) of the classical order parameter field .",
    "if the order parameter field is charged , however , it couples to the electromagnetic gauge field , and the goldstone boson is absent due to the higgs mechanism . the physical principle underlying the mechanism",
    "was discovered by anderson  @xcite in the context of superconductivity : as the electromagnetic interaction is long - ranged , the mode corresponding to very slow spatial variations in the phase @xmath3 of the superconducting order parameter , which implies currents by the equation of motion and hence also variations in the density of the superfluid by the continuity equation , acquires a gap ( or `` mass '' ) given by the plasma frequency .",
    "most of the phenomenology of superfluidity or superconductivity can be derived from a simple effective field theory , which in the latter case displays the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is probably best to turn directly to the low - energy effective lagrangian for the superconductor , as it contains the superfluid as the special case where the coupling @xmath88 of the order parameter to the electromagnetic gauge field is set to zero . to motivate the lagrangian , recall first the ginzburg ",
    "landau  @xcite expansion of the free energy density in terms of the order parameter ( which is now normalized differently from ( [ e : bcsop ] ) above ) in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath89 , where the transition between normal and superconducting phases occurs : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the effective mass and charge of the electron pairs , respectively , and @xmath93 is the magnetic field .",
    "the material parameter @xmath94 changes sign to become negative as we pass through the transition from above , while @xmath95 has to remain positive . minimizing the free energy in the superconducting phase yields that ( i ) the gradient term must vanish , ( ii ) @xmath96 , and ( iii )",
    "this means that the amplitude @xmath98 of the order parameter @xmath99 has to be fixed while the phase @xmath3 , which labels the many degenerate ground state configurations , can be arbitrary as long as the variation over the sample is given by @xmath100 which implies @xmath101 if we choose the gauge @xmath102 . in the vicinity of the transition",
    ", we may treat @xmath103 as a small parameter , which implies that the expansion ( [ e : lg ] ) provides us with a complete description of the system at the level of thermodynamics .    the ginzburg ",
    "landau expansion is also helpful in motivating the low energy effective lagrange density at low temperatures . to begin with",
    ", we may assume that since the amplitude fluctuations are massive , they do not enter in the low energy description .",
    "taking @xmath104 to be constant , the free energy density above reduces to a constant , an electromagnetic field contribution , and @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a phenomenological parameter which depends on the material and the temperature .",
    "it has the dimension of a density and is equal to the density of the superfluid in the absence of currents and inhomogeneities at @xmath107 , as we shall see below .",
    "it is usually referred to as the superfluid density , but it would be more appropriate to use the superfluid stiffness @xmath108 as a parameter instead  @xcite .",
    "we will also see below that galilean invariance of the superfluid implies that @xmath91 is the bare mass of the superfluid particles , @xmath109 for cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "we take ( [ e : fmag ] ) to be part of the potential energy in the effective lagrange density for the superfluid .",
    "the remaining contribution arises from the coupling of the charge of the superfluid to the electrostatic potential @xmath110 , which is in leading order given by @xmath111 this term is usually not included in the free energy of the superconductor , as it is always canceled off by another such term with opposite sign arising from the uniform positive background charge .",
    "it is essential to our effective field theory here , however , as it is part of the lagrange density for the superfluid , while the uniform background charge is accounted for by another lagrange density @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes spacetime .",
    "note that @xmath114 is not invariant under ( time dependent ) gauge transformations @xmath115    we now turn to the kinetic energy term in the effective lagrange density .",
    "the simplest gauge invariant lagrange density containing both potential energy terms above is given by  @xcite @xmath116 this lagrange density , however , can not be complete .",
    "the only term containing a time derivative , @xmath117 , appears as a total derivative ( here time derivative of @xmath3 ) and hence does not affect the euler ",
    "lagrange equations of motion .",
    "it is nonetheless of physical significance , as it both ensures gauge invariance and accounts for the leading contribution to the particle density , as we will see below .    to obtain a second order time derivative term ,",
    "recall that the characteristic feature of a neutral ( @xmath118 ) superfluid is that the only excitation at low energies is a sound wave with a linear dispersion @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the wave number and @xmath121 is the velocity of sound in the fluid . as we wish the effective lagrange density for the superfluid both to be gauge invariant and to yield ( [ e : lindis ] ) as an equation of motion for @xmath118 , we arrive at @xmath122 with @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath24 , the lagrange density may also be written @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "the total lagrangian of the system is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the standard maxwell lagrange density for electromagnetism .",
    "the astonishing feature is now that this simple lagrangian for the compact u(1 ) field @xmath129 ( compact since the values @xmath3 and @xmath130 describe the same physical state and hence must be identified ) coupled to the electromagnetic gauge field accounts for all the essential features of superfluidity or superconductivity .",
    "there are also important corrections to it , but we will discover them automatically as we proceed .    in order understand the physical content of the lagrangian , it is highly instructive to study its symmetries , in particular particle number conservation and invariance under translations in space and time .",
    "we wish our analysis to apply both to the case of a neutral and a charged superfluid . in the former case ,",
    "the theory is no longer invariant under a local u(1 ) gauge transformation ( as the electromagnetic gauge transformation ( [ e : gaugeprel ] ) reduces to the identity transformation for @xmath118 ) but still invariant under a global u(1 ) rotation @xmath131 where @xmath132 is independent of spacetime .",

    "this concludes our derivation or motivation of the fundamental equations of superfluidity in the limit of low temperatures and low energies . before turning to the phenomenology these equations imply ,",
    "i would like to digress briefly and justify one of the implicit assumptions made above .",

    "these numbers are comparable to the position and momentum uncertainties of a macroscopic object .",
    "the description of a macroscopic superfluid in terms of a classical field theory is therefore as appropriate as the classical description of any other macroscopic object .",
    "this is of course not in contradiction with the fact that planck s constant @xmath229 appears in this effective field theory .",
    "we will see below that it manifests itself in a family of `` quantum effects '' , which are related to the compactness of the u(1 ) field @xmath129 .",
    "these effects require either a non - trivial topology or more than one superfluid , and are very similar for neutral and for charged superfluids .",
    "to begin with , however , let us consider the superfluid flow in a simply connected superfluid .",
    "the phenomenology depends strikingly on whether the fluid is charged or not . for a neutral superfluid , @xmath118 , and the gauge field decouples completely . even for a fixed set of boundary conditions",
    ", we have an infinite set of solutions for the superfluid flow , corresponding via @xmath230 to all possible choices of the phase field @xmath129 . in a simply connected superfluid",
    ", the flow will be vortex - free , @xmath231 and subject to boundary constraints , but apart from this , it only has to satisfy the continuity equation as an equation of motion .",
    "the simplest example of a multiply connected superfluid is a superfluid with a line defect , or vortex , along which the magnitude @xmath232 of the superfluid order parameter vanishes .",
    "the phase @xmath129 still has to be single valued everywhere in the fluid , but being a phase , its value may change by a multiple of @xmath233 as we circumvent the line defect along a closed curve @xmath234 : @xmath235 where @xmath236 is an integer .",
    "the angular momentum of each superfluid `` particle '' around the vortex is hence quantized in units of @xmath229 . with stokes theorem and the definition @xmath237 we may express this alternatively as quantization condition for the vorticity @xmath238 where @xmath239 is a unit vector normal to the surface and the area integral extends over any open surface @xmath45 which is pierced by the vortex once .",
    "the quantization of vortices in a superfluid is the simplest of the `` quantum effects '' alluded to above , where planck s constant @xmath229 enters in the phenomenology through the compactness of the field @xmath129 .",
    "( if @xmath129 was not compact , we could eliminate @xmath229 completely from the effective theory by rescaling @xmath240 . )",
    "let us now turn to the phenomenology of a simply connected charged superfluid or superconductor , which displays the higgs mechanism .",
    "the essence of the mechanism is that the phase field @xmath129 looses its independent significance in the presence of the gauge field .",
    "there are two ways of seeing this .",
    "the first is on the level of the equations of motion .",
    "we can simply choose a gauge such that @xmath241 everywhere in the fluid ; any other choice of gauge can be brought into this gauge via ( [ e : gauge ] ) with @xmath242 the second is on the level of the effective lagrangian .",
    "we may introduce a new vector field @xmath243 in terms of this field , the superfluid lagrange density ( [ e : ls3 ] ) looks the same except that all terms containing @xmath3 have disappeared .",
    "in particular , the terms quadratic in the derivatives of @xmath3 in @xmath157 have turned into a mass term @xmath244 for the vector field . the maxwell lagrange density and the lagrange density for the uniform neutralizing background charge take the same form with @xmath245 and @xmath246 replaced by @xmath247 and @xmath248 , respectively , except for a total derivative or boundary term we discard .",
    "thus the massless gauge field @xmath246 is replaced by a massive vector field @xmath248 , while the goldstone boson @xmath3 disappeared .",
    "the total number of degrees of freedom , however , is preserved : before , the massless vector field has two ( the two helicity states of the photon ) and the goldstone boson one , while the massive vector field after the change of variables has three degrees of freedom . in sidney",
    "coleman s words , `` the vector field has eaten the goldstone bosons and grown heavy ''  @xcite .",
    "we will return to this issue after studying the phenomenology of the superconductor using the equations of motion .",
    "the euler  lagrange equation for @xmath246 , @xmath249 yields maxwell s electrodynamics with electric charge density @xmath250 and current @xmath251 , @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 and @xmath255 are given by ( [ e : rho3 ] ) and ( [ e : j3 ] ) , respectively . in principle , we could also obtain the continuity equation ( [ e : cont ] ) as the euler  lagrange equation for @xmath3 , but since @xmath256 depends on derivatives of @xmath246 only through @xmath245 and @xmath3 is minimally coupled to @xmath246 , ( [ e : cont ] ) is automatically satisfied by any solution of ( [ e : max1 ] ) and ( [ e : max2 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath3 has lost its independent significance due to the higgs mechanism .    for convenience , we choose the gauge @xmath241 .",
    "then ( [ e : rho3 ] ) , ( [ e : j3 ] ) , and ( [ e : vs ] ) imply @xmath257 @xmath258 let us now restrict our attention to quasistatic phenomena , where we can neglect the time derivative terms .",
    "the analysis given below implies that this assumption holds for frequencies significantly smaller than @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the london penetration depth .",
    "then ( [ e : max1])([e : j4 ] ) reduce to @xmath261 let us first look at the linear terms in these equations , the solution for infinitesimal @xmath262 and @xmath26 . under quasistatic conditions , ( [ e : max2 ] ) implies @xmath263 and with ( [ e : j4 ] ) for infinitesimal fields @xmath264 .",
    "the equations reduce to @xmath265 we have electric screening in addition to magnetic screening , but with a screening length reduced by a factor @xmath266 .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the dominant energy is the coulomb interaction , which effects charge neutrality or @xmath267 .",
    "we now simply assume that this is a valid approximation , and justify it _",
    "a posteriori_. then ( [ e : rho4 ] ) implies @xmath268 and ( [ e : j4 ] ) reduces to @xmath269 taking the curl of this equation , we obtain london s equation  @xcite @xmath270 under quasistatic conditions , we have again @xmath263 and with ( [ e : j5 ] ) @xmath264 , which implies that ( [ e : eom2 ] ) reduces to ( [ e : eomi2 ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ e : eomi2 ] ) describes exponential screening with penetration depth @xmath271 .",
    "if we have , for example , a superconductor which occupies the half - space @xmath272 subject to an external magnetic field @xmath273 at the boundary @xmath274 , we obtain @xmath275 where @xmath276 the screening of the magnetic field is known as the meissner effect . according to ( [ e : hall ] ) , the vector potential implies an electrostatic potential @xmath277 this potential allows us to verify the validity of our approximation @xmath267 . substituting ( [ e : hall2 ] ) into ( [ e : eomi1 ] ) , we find that the ratio of the neglected term to the terms kept is @xmath278 the approximation is excellent .",
    "the electrostatic potential ( [ e : hall2 ] ) is called the london or bernoulli hall effect  @xcite . to understand its physical origin , it is best to rewrite ( [ e : hall ] ) with ( [ e : vs ] ) for @xmath241 in terms of the superfluid velocity :",
    "@xmath279 the electrostatic potential simply compensates the kinetic energy contribution to the chemical potential , as required by ( [ e : h1 ] ) with @xmath241 .",
    "for stationary flow , this condition reduces to the requirement that the electrochemical potential @xmath280 is constant across the superconductor . in practice",
    ", the london hall effect can only be measured with capacitive contacts , as ohmic contacts are sensitive to the electrochemical rather than the electrostatic potential  @xcite .",
    "the effect furnishes us with an independent meaning of the superfluid density @xmath194 or the effective mass @xmath91 , while under quasistatic conditions all other effects  @xcite depend only on the superfluid stiffness @xmath281 .",
    "the underlying theoretical reason is that the london hall effect is a consequence of the corrections incorporated in the effective lagrange density ( [ e : ls3 ] ) . in these terms , the parameter @xmath91 enters by itself , while ( apart from a total time derivative term irrelevant to the equations of motion ) only the combination @xmath281 entered in the previous approximative lagrangian ( [ e : ltot ] ) with ( [ e : ls ] ) , ( [ e : lb ] ) and ( [ e : lmax ] ) .",
    "since we have given a precise definition of the superfluid velocity , it is legitimate to ask whether the london hall effect ( [ e : hall4 ] ) balances the lorentz force , or , if not , what other forces balance it . the total electromagnetic force on a given particle with charge @xmath282 in the fluid is given by @xmath283 with ( [ e : hall4 ] ) and ( [ e : vs ] ) we obtain @xmath284 thus the gradient @xmath285 of the electrostatic potential ( [ e : hall4 ] ) does not balance the lorentz force @xmath286 , but both terms together account for the difference between local and substantial acceleration ( [ e : force ] ) in the superfluid .",
    "this difference is significant when , for example , the flow is stationary but does not follow a straight line .",
    "let us summarize how the higgs mechanism manifests itself in the equations of motion .",
    "for a neutral superfluid with @xmath118 , there are many solutions to @xmath287 for fixed boundary conditions , corresponding to all possible configurations for the phase field @xmath129 .",
    "these solutions reflect the existence of the massless sound mode described by the field @xmath129 .",
    "for the charged superfluid , however , all the different configurations for @xmath129 merely correspond to different choices of gauge ; as far as the current or magnetic field distributions are concerned , all these solutions are always equivalent to one for which we have @xmath241 .",
    "thus the field @xmath3 does no longer describe an excitation . for a simply connected superconductor ,",
    "it is only meaningful in that it assures gauge invariance , both on the level of the lagrange density and on the level of the equations of motion .",
    "the solution of these equations is physically ( apart from the freedom to choose the gauge ) unique for a given set of boundary conditions .",
    "we now return to the manifestation of the higgs mechanism on the level of the lagrangian . for a simply connected superconductor",
    ", we have already seen that we may eliminate the phase field @xmath3 if we introduce a new vector field @xmath248 according to ( [ e : newfields ] ) . the mass term ( [ e : mass ] )",
    "we find for @xmath248 may appear to violate gauge invariance , as mass terms generally do , and may , at first sight , to be taken as a signature of a spontaneously broken gauge invariance .",
    "for one thing , however , gauge invariance is not violated . from the definition ( [ e : newfields ] ) it is clear that the new field simply transforms as @xmath288 under a gauge transformation ( [ e : gauge ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian hence remains manifestly gauge invariant , and has to remain gauge invariant , as it is the same lagrangian as before expressed in terms of different fields .",
    "furthermore , if a symmetry is spontaneously broken , it is never violated on the level of the lagrangian or the hamiltonian , but only on the level of the ground state .    in the literature",
    ", one sometimes finds the statement that `` the gauge field acquires a mass '' due to the higgs mechanism .",
    "this is not exactly to the point , as it suggests that the massive vector field @xmath248 is still a gauge field , while we have just seen that it is gauge invariant . in the case of a superconductor , we even know how to interpret the individual components of @xmath248 physically . according to ( [ e : newfields ] ) , ( [ e : mu ] ) , and ( [ e : vs ] ) , @xmath289 the higgs mechanism hence does not imply that `` the electromagnetic gauge field acquires a mass '' , but only that we can describe the superconductor in terms of gauge invariant fields , that is , in terms of the chemical potential @xmath290 and the superfluid velocity @xmath188 . if we do this , we also have to express the maxwell lagrange density ( [ e : lmax ] ) in terms of @xmath291 and @xmath292 . with @xmath293",
    "we obtain for the total lagrange density @xmath294 the euler ",
    "lagrange equations we obtain from ( [ e : l2 ] ) for @xmath291 and @xmath292 are equivalent to ( [ e : max1])([e : j4 ] ) , and yield exactly the same solution as above .",
    "writing the lagrangian in terms of @xmath291 and @xmath292 does not yield any practical advantage , but clearly illustrates that gauge invariance has become irrelevant  it is not broken , but has simply left the stage .",
    "since all the fields are gauge invariant , ( [ e : l2 ] ) does not even provide a framework to think of a spontaneous violation of a gauge invariance .",
    "these considerations apply to every field theory which displays the higgs mechanism . in any such theory ,",
    "the lagrange density is invariant under a global physical symmetry for a matter field , and invariant under a local gauge symmetry , which affects both the matter field and the gauge field .",
    "the global symmetry is `` physical '' as we can classify the states of matter according to their transformation properties , while the gauge symmetry is `` unphysical '' as gauge transformations have no effect on the states of matter , but only on our description of these states . in our example of a superfluid , charged or neutral ,",
    "the global symmetry transformation is @xmath295 where @xmath132 is independent of spacetime .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously violated , which means that there are many degenerate ground states which map into each other under ( [ e : global ] ) . for a neutral superfluid",
    ", we obtain a massless mode according to goldstone s theorem .",
    "the situation is more subtle for a superconductor , as the matter field is coupled to a gauge field and the lagrange density is also invariant under the gauge transformation ( [ e : gauge ] ) .",
    "this `` unphysical '' symmetry , however , seems to contain the physical symmetry as the special case @xmath296 the formal equivalence of the transformation ( [ e : global ] ) and ( [ e : gauge ] ) with ( [ e : globalgauge ] ) is at the root of the widely established but incorrect interpretation of ( [ e : global ] ) as a gauge transformation , and in particular of the spontaneous violation of ( [ e : global ] ) as a spontaneous violation of a gauge symmetry .",
    "( this is presumably the reason why particle physicists like steven weinberg speak of `` spontaneously broken gauge symmetries '' interchangeably with `` the higgs mechanism '' . )",
    "the problem here is that the equivalence is only formal .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ e : globalgauge ] ) represents a transformation of our description , similar to a rotation of a coordinate system we use to describe a physical state , while the transformation ( [ e : global ] ) corresponds to a transformation of our physical state , like a rotation of a physical system .",
    "clearly , a ( counterclockwise ) rotation of the coordinate system has the same effect on our equations as a ( clockwise ) rotation of the physical system we describe with these equations , but the transformations are all but equivalent .",
    "it is hence incorrect to refer to the spontaneous violation of ( [ e : global ] ) as a spontaneous violation of gauge symmetry .",
    "a gauge symmetry can not be spontaneously violated as a matter of principle .",
    "the difference between the `` physical '' symmetry ( [ e : global ] ) and the gauge symmetry ( [ e : gauge ] ) can also be appreciated at the level of conservation laws . the former yields particle number ( or charge ) as a conserved quantity , according to ( [ e : cont ] ) , while there is no conservation law associated with the latter . in the literature , ( [ e : global ] ) is often referred to as a global gauge transformation , and the conservation of charge attributed to gauge invariance .",
    "this view , however , is not consistent .",
    "if one speaks of a global gauge symmetry , this symmetry has to be a proper subgroup of the local gauge symmetry group .",
    "the alleged global gauge symmetry hence can not be a `` physical '' symmetry while the local gauge symmetry is an invariance of description , or be spontaneously violated while the local symmetry is fully intact .",
    "the difference between the global phase rotation ( [ e : global ] ) and a global gauge rotation ( [ e : globalgauge ] ) is even more at evident at the level of quantum states .",
    "the bcs ground state ( [ e : bcs ] ) is , for example , not invariant under ( [ e : global ] ) , while it is fully gauge invariant , as we have seen in section [ sec : gau ]    the conclusions regarding the physical significance ( or maybe better insignificance ) of gauge transformations we reached here for superconductors hold for any field theory which displays the higgs mechanism .",
    "this discussion of the higgs mechanism applies only to simply connected superconductors .",
    "if we have a nontrivial topology or more than one superfluid , the phase field @xmath3 reassumes physical significance through its compactness , that is , the fact that its value is only defined modulo @xmath233 . in these situations , we are not allowed to set @xmath241 in the equations of motion or eliminate it from the effective lagrange density via ( [ e : newfields ] ) or ( [ eq : a ] ) , as we would loose the information regarding the compactness . since the phase field @xmath3 is multiplied by planck s constant @xmath229 whenever it enters in the lagrange density , any effect due to the compactness of @xmath3 will depend on @xmath229 , and only exist for @xmath297 .",
    "therefore we refer to them as `` quantum effects '' .",
    "the simplest of these effects in superconductors is the quantization of magnetic flux , which is analogous to the quantization of vorticity in neutral superfluids .",
    "the effect was predicted by london in a footnote in his first book  @xcite almost a decade before bcs proposed their microscopic theory . consider a macroscopic superconductor with a hole in it , which may either be a hole in the superconducting material or a line defect or vortex in the superconducting order parameter .",

    "we now take @xmath234 well inside the superconductor , that is , separated at each point by a distance much larger than the penetration depth @xmath271 from the hole or defect .",
    "then , according to the meissner effect or our derivation of london s equation above , which still applies locally , the superfluid velocity @xmath299 has to vanish along @xmath234 , and ( [ e : vortex2 ] ) implies @xmath300 where we have used stokes theorem once more . the magnetic flux through the hole or vortex is hence quantized in units of @xmath301 , which for @xmath302 is half of the dirac flux quantum .",
    "note that the vorticity ( [ e : vorti ] ) is not quantized in a superconductor .",
    "we now review two further quantum effects , which are similar in neutral and charged superfluids ; as in our derivation of the effective theory above , the equations for the latter case contain the former as the special case @xmath118 .",
    "one of the effects is phase slippage  @xcite .",
    "consider two points @xmath303 and @xmath304 in a superfluid , which are connected by a vertical path",
    "( see now imagine we adiabatically move a vortex from the very far left across the path to the very far right .",
    "this process yields a difference in the electrochemical potential between the two points , which is according to ( [ e : muelch ] ) given by @xmath305 where the line integral is taken along the path between the points .",
    "the time integrated difference in the electrochemical potential is hence given by the difference between the line integral at the end of the process and the line integral at the beginning .",
    "let us first consider the case of a neutral superfluid , @xmath118 .",
    "the line integral of @xmath306 will have changed by @xmath233 , as the difference in the paths is topologically equivalent to encircling the vortex once ( see .",
    "alternatively , we may say the vortex has dragged a branch cut across the path .",
    "( we assume that at the beginning and the end , the vortex is so far away from points @xmath303 and @xmath304 that we can neglect its influence on the line integral . )",
    "if we now have a continuous flow of vortices across the path , the line integral will pick up a contribution of @xmath307 from each of them , and we obtain a chemical potential difference @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the average rate of vortices crossing the path .",
    "let us now turn to the case of a superconductor , where we assume that during the entire process the distance between the vortex and either of the points @xmath303 and @xmath304 is much larger than the penetration depth . since the line integral we obtain when encircling a superconducting vortex along a circle well inside the superconductor is zero , @xmath310 we do not obtain a difference in the electrochemical potential as we move an isolated vortex carrying a magnetic flux quantum across the path .",
    "so , at first sight , it may appear as there is no phase slippage effect in superconductors .",
    "the situation just described , however , is not the general one , as we dragged a unit of magnetic flux with the vortex from the very far left to the very far right .",
    "this produced a hall effect which exactly canceled the phase slippage effect .",
    "if we consider a situation where we have a large , almost uniform magnetic field and an abrikosov vortex lattice or liquid in which the distance between the vortices is much smaller than the penetration depth , and we have a flow of vortices across the path , the magnetic field will remain to a reasonable approximation unaffected by the flow and we recover ( [ e : phslip ] ) for the electrochemical potential difference .",
    "the voltage we measure between the two points is then given by @xmath311 this voltage is known as the nernst effect in superconductors .    the last and possibly most striking quantum effect we review is the josephson effect  @xcite .",
    "consider two superfluids or superconductors s@xmath312 and s@xmath313 , which are weakly coupled , say by a narrow constriction for superfluid particles or a tunneling barrier for cooper pairs .",
    "the only requirement for the effect is that there is an energy associated with the weak link , which depends on the ( gauge invariant ) phase difference @xmath217 between two points 2 and 1 in superfluids s@xmath313 and s@xmath312 : @xmath314 with @xmath315 where the line integral is taken along the path the superfluid particles take when they move from one superfluid to the other .",
    "note that @xmath217 divided by the distance between the points 2 and 1 is just the discrete version of the gradient term @xmath316 we already encountered in the ginzburg  landau free energy , where the magnetic energy ( [ e : fmag ] ) was essentially given by its square .",
    "we assume that @xmath317 is likewise minimal for @xmath318 , which implies that the first term in a taylor expansion around this minimum is quadratic in @xmath217 . in the case of the junction , however , this term is not sufficient .",
    "since @xmath3 is only defined modulo @xmath233 , @xmath319 has to be a periodic function of @xmath217 .",
    "josephson has shown that to a reasonable approximation , it is given by @xmath320 let us now assume a situation where both macroscopic superfluids are in a state of equilibrium , but the phases are not necessarily aligned relative to each other .",
    "then only the energy stored in the junction depends on the phases of the superfluids , and the `` characteristic equation '' ( [ e : h2  ] ) becomes for superfluid s@xmath313 @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the number of superfluid particles or cooper pairs in s@xmath313 .",
    "( we would also obtain a similar equation for s@xmath312 , but since we assume @xmath323 and @xmath317 only depends on @xmath324 , it does not provide any additional information . ) the particle current from superfluid s@xmath312 to s@xmath313 is hence given by @xmath325 on the other hand , since the other `` characteristic equation '' ( [ e : h1 ] ) holds for each superfluid , @xmath326 if we add @xmath327 to both sides of ( [ e : h1  ] ) , we obtain @xmath328 or , if we take @xmath329 time independent , @xmath330 substitution into ( [ e : josj ] ) yields @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the josephson frequency .",
    "this implies that if the electrochemical potential is equal for both superfluids , we find a dc particle current depending on the initial alignment of the phases .",
    "if there is a difference in the potential , however , the current will oscillate with frequency @xmath333 .",
    "this is called the ac josephson effect .",
    "the effect exists for both neutral and charged superfluids , but it is much easier to measure in a superconductor , as we can realize a difference in the electrochemical potential by applying a voltage @xmath334 across the junction , @xmath335 , and easily measure oscillations in the electrical current .",
    "note that the josephson effect , so astonishing its phenomenology may be , follows through the `` characteristic '' equations of superfluidity directly from the fact that there is a broken symmetry in superfluids and that the compact phase field which labels the different degenerate ground states is the field conjugate to the density in the superfluid .",
    "the other assumption we made in this article , the assumption that both current and momentum are carried by the same species of particles in a superfluid , was not required to explain any of the quantum effects .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the position space wave function ( [ e : bcsn ] ) by projecting the bcs state ( [ e : bcs ] ) onto a fixed number of pairs @xmath8 .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) bcs state may be written @xmath336 @xmath337 the pair creation operator @xmath338 is given by @xmath339 where @xmath15 is given by ( [ e : varphi ] ) .",
    "if we now project out a state with @xmath8 pairs according to ( [ e : project ] ) , we obtain @xmath340 which is ( up to a normalization ) equivalent to ( [ e : bcsn ] ) .",
    "i wish to thank t.  kopp , d.  schuricht , m.  vojta , and p.  wlfle for discussions of various aspects of this work .",
    "there are relativistic corrections to this , arising from the binding energy of the cooper pairs .",
    "the theory of those is still controversial ; see for example m.  liu , _ phys .",
    "lett .  _ * 81 * , 3223 ( 1998 ) and references therein .",
    "feynman , r.b .",
    "leighton , and m.  sands , _ the feynman lectures of physics _ ( addison wesley , 1965 ) .",
    "feynman takes the point of view that since @xmath341 may be interpreted as a condensate wave function , it should obey a schrdinger equation .",
    "the corresponding lagrange density is given by @xmath342 if one takes the amplitude @xmath232 constant , this reduces to the lagrange density given in the text .",
    "note , however , that there is no connection as of yet between the effective mass @xmath91 in ( [ e : tvs])([e : gal2 ] ) and @xmath91 in the effective lagrange density .",
    "the equivalence is only established with ( [ e : js ] ) and ( [ e : gww ] ) below .            strictly speaking ,",
    "this is london s second and more famous equation . the first equation",
    ", @xmath343 is obtained from ( [ e : muelch ] ) with ( [ e : j3 ] ) if we neglect the @xmath344 term , which is a rather crude approximation .",
    "there is yet another effect which depends on the cooper pair mass directly .",
    "if one rotates a superconductor , the rotation of the uniformly charged background induces a uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath345 well inside the superconductor , where @xmath346 is the angular velocity of rotation . to derive this effect , one simply has to add the electric current @xmath347 induced by the rotating background charge to the right of ( [ e : max2 ] ) : @xmath348 discarding the time derivative term and taking the curl , one obtains with ( [ e : j5 ] ) and @xmath349 @xmath350 solving this equation yields @xmath351 and therefore a uniform magnetic field deep inside the superconductor .",
