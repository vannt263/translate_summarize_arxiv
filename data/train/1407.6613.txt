    "the development of attosecond light sources paved the way for new exciting opportunities for studying time - resolved dynamical processes .",
    "experiments on the attosecond electron dynamics in atomic , molecular and condensed matter systems confirmed the feasibility of this technique for a wide class of systems @xcite . thereby , an attosecond streaking metrology is employed for tracing the dynamics @xcite : an extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulse with a duration of a few hundred attoseconds plays the role of the pump and a phase - controlled few - cycle infrared ( ir ) pulse acts as the probe pulse . the coherent xuv pulse is characterized by a moderate intensity , short wavelength and a keldysh parameter @xmath0 .",
    "valence electrons , which are emitted due to the action of the xuv field , are accelerated to different final momenta in the presence of the ir field .",
    "the asymptotic momenta depend on the vector potential of the ir - field while the electron recedes from the residual ion allowing thus to access time information via momentum measurements .",
    "the experiment in ref.@xcite reports on the time delay in the photoemission of electrons from the @xmath1 subshell relative to those from the @xmath2 subshell .",
    "a series of theoretical works were developed to quantitatively reproduce the measurements ( for a review of the time delay concept we refer to ref . and references therein ) . in the present work",
    "we refer for details of the time delay theory / interpretation we refer to the review articles @xcite .",
    "the experiment yielded a relative time delay of @xmath3  as . within an independent electron model schultze _",
    "were able to calculate a delay of 6.37  as from matrix elements obtained by means of the state - specific expansion approach @xcite .",
    "ivanov and kheifets reached a delay of 6.2 as by calculating scattering phases and dipole matrix elements in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "accounting for first order correlation correction via the random phase approximation with exchange ( rpae ) added 2.2 as .",
    "another factor that may influence the time delay is the interaction between the photoelectron and the infrared field .",
    "the measured delays can be generally divided in two parts .",
    "the first is the wigner - like delay @xmath4 originating from the xuv photoionization process @xcite , while the second term is a contribution from the interaction of the moving photoelectron ( in the coulomb - field of the residual ion ) with the ir field , which is called coulomb - laser coupling delay @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6 zhang and thumm showed for then one - dimensional hydrogen model that the resulting delay is independent of the ir pulse intensity @xcite .",
    "_ confirmed this statement with the help of three - dimensional full numerical propagation simulations .",
    "they found that the wigner - delay is accessible by streaking only if distortions of both the initial - state entrance channel and the final - state exit channels ( e.g. initial state polarization by ir or combined coulomb - ir fields ) are precisely accounted for @xcite .",
    "recently moore _",
    "_ @xcite found a value of @xmath7  as for relative delay between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 subshells when using the r - matrix method .",
    "the discrepancy between theory and experiment is not yet resolved , however .",

    "et al_. reported on the relative time delay between the photoemissions from the @xmath8 and @xmath9 subshells of argon for photon energies in the range of 34 to 40 ev @xcite .",
    "this measurement was repeated later by gunot _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , whose results agree very well , except for that obtained at the highest energy corresponding to 40  ev . + the angular dependence of the time delay has received relatively less attention .",
    "e.g. , it was calculated for hydrogen atom showing a strong dependence of the time delay around @xmath10 with respect to the laser polarization axis @xcite .",
    "h@xmath11 was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ in the experiment the time - of - flight detector ( tof ) collects all electrons within a certain solid angle .",
    "we introduce the angle @xmath12 between the asymptotic direction of the momentum of the photoelectron and the laser polarization axis .",
    "the latter is chosen to be parallel to the @xmath13-axis .",
    "the aim here is to investigate to which extent the angular dependence influences the resulting time delay with reference to its value by @xmath14 .",
    "we analyze whether the calculations allow for some trends in the angle - dependent time delay . to address this point",
    "we study all possible propagation directions of the photoelectrons and calculate the corresponding angle - resolved time delays for neon and argon .",
    "+ we concentrate on the angular dependence of the wigner time delay @xmath4 , which enters the time delay in eq . and the delay measured in attosecond streaking experiments .",
    "the corrections to the wigner time delay through the coulomb - laser coupling effect can be evaluated according to @xcite .",
    "neon was chosen because of the experiment by schultze _",
    "_ @xcite and the large number of theoretical results for the relative time delay between photoemissions from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states ; argon on the other hand is interesting due to the presence of a cooper minimum in the spectra .",
    "the atomic units will be used throughout the text unless indicated otherwise . the wave function representing a photoelectron wave packet is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 stand for a set of continuum wave functions of the system and @xmath17 are the corresponding projection coefficients .",
    "the projection coefficients corresponding to photoionization of a bound state indexed @xmath18 are in general angle - dependent and can be evaluated as @xmath19 we employ the length gauge @xmath20 for the interaction with the laser electric field @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the matrix element @xmath22 for transition from the bound state @xmath23 to the continuum state @xmath24 with the free energy @xmath25 have to be calculated , where @xmath26 is the frequency of xuv pulse and @xmath27 is the energy eigenvalue of the bound state .",
    "we express the wave function of the initial state as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the radial and spherical parts of the wave functions indexed by the usual quantum numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the continuum states we expand in partial waves @xcite @xmath33 the radial wavefunctions are normalized as @xmath34 . for bound states we use a self - consistent hf method @xcite , while the continuum states are evaluated in the hf frozen core approximation @xcite .",

    "the reduced coulomb matrix elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 describe the time - forward and time - reversed correlation processes , which include both direct and exchange parts @xcite .",
    "important for the phase information is that the integration in the time - forward term contains a pole with the consequence that the reduced matrix element is complex and acquires therefore an extra phase .",
    "thus , @xmath42 can be expressed as @xmath49 .",
    "the rpae dipole matrix element has now the form @xmath50 the wigner time delay is defined as the energy derivative of photoionization amplitude of the respective subshell i , i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ] , which provides a direct connection between the time delay and scattering phases @xmath53 , which strongly influence the dipole matrix element . by writing the spherical harmonics",

    "one can see immediately that in this case the phase of the dipole matrix element @xmath62 is only dependent on the angle @xmath63 but not on @xmath64 ( since @xmath32 is zero ) .",
    "this means that the time delay @xmath4 as the energy derivative has an angular dependence which is strongly influenced by the ratio @xmath65 and the scattering phases @xmath66 . + in the cases of photoemission from a @xmath67 state ( @xmath68 and @xmath61 ) and photoemission from a @xmath59 state with @xmath69 eq . reduces to @xmath70 , because @xmath71 vanishes . in these special cases",
    "the time delay as the energy derivative of @xmath62 is only characterized by the properties of the scattering phase @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the hf and rpae theory predicts that we find no angular dependence of these state - specific time delays .",
    "+ the time delays defined as the energy derivative of the phase of the photoionization amplitude eq .",
    "are in general energy - dependent . to find the characteristic time delay corresponding to the photon frequency @xmath74 we have to average over the ionization probability @xmath75 , which has also an angular dependence due to the angular dependence of @xmath76 .",
    "finally we define the time delays corresponding to photoionization from the @xmath67 and @xmath59 subshells : @xmath77",
    "the considered xuv field is modeled as @xmath78 for times @xmath79 within the interval @xmath80 $ ] and vanishes otherwise . in view of the experiment @xcite the parameter @xmath81 for ne",
    "is chosen such that the pulse fwhm is 182 as .",
    "the amplitude of the electric field of xuv field is 0.12  a.u . which corresponds to a peak intensity of @xmath82 w/@xmath83 .",

    "although the rpae is a more advanced theory because it treats intershell correlation we compare its predictions of the angular dependence with a full three dimensional sae ( single active electron ) propagation .",
    "previous studies showed that in ne the intershell correlation has no significant impact on the @xmath1 photoionization process @xcite , which is according to eq .",

    "+ the rpae results indicate a strong angular dependence of the time delay which corresponds to the @xmath1 photoionization channel with @xmath61 .",

    "we find only a weak angular dependence around @xmath97 , which can be explained by the fact that the partial waves with @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which dominate the ionization channels of these initial states , vanish and partial waves with higher angular momenta become decisive .",
    "+ the time delay of the photoionization process corresponding to the @xmath1 initial state with @xmath100 shows substantial variations .",
    "the pronounced sharp structures around @xmath101 emerge due to the vanishing contribution of the typically dominating transition to the @xmath102 partial wave @xcite , that means the corresponding phase @xmath103 mainly determines the time delay . from eq .",
    "follows that the phase @xmath62 is then mainly determindes by the scattering phase @xmath104 , whose energy derivative is negative .",

    "the panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ delayneon ] ) shows the angular dependence of the relative delay .",
    "the results illustrate that the strong effect of the angular dependence corresponding to the @xmath1 initial state with @xmath100 is nearly compensated by the constant time delays corresponding to @xmath108 ; underpinning the fact that the sum in the denominator of eq .",
