    "later , other algorithms were discovered by shackleton @xcite and webb @xcite , but none of these algorithms were studied seriously from the viewpoint of doing explicit computations , and all seem unsuitable for that purpose .",

    "the gray sides of the rectangle are identified , left - to - right and top - to - bottom , to form a torus minus two discs .",

    "three such @xmath114 can be immediately identified .",
    "this is because the complement of @xmath115 in @xmath109 is a collection of some number of @xmath10-gon regions and one single @xmath12-gon region .",
    "the boundary of any one of these regions is an alternating joining of segments in @xmath82 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , any @xmath10-gon boundary has two segments in @xmath81 ; and , the boundary of the single @xmath12-gon has @xmath116 segments in @xmath81 . requiring that any @xmath112 intersect segments of @xmath81 at most once forces it to either not intersect a @xmath10-gon , or intersect each of the two @xmath81 segments of a @xmath10-gon once .",

    "minimum is not realizable and the realizable minimum is in fact @xmath10 .",
    "recent work of aougab and huang @xcite has given a construction for realizing the theoretical minimum for @xmath124 .",
    "additionally , they show that all such minimum filling pairs are distance @xmath31 . for fixed @xmath1 , using his uniform hyperbolicity result , aougab proved that the theoretical minimum intersection number grows exponentially as a function of distance ( theorem 1.2 , @xcite ) .",
    "also , aougab and taylor @xcite give a recipe for producing filling pairs at a given distance whose intersection numbers are close to the minimum in an asymptotic sense ; see their paper for the precise statement .",
    "ido , jang and kobayashi @xcite also have a construction for producing filling pairs of a prescribed distance . the arguments in these last three citations employs the high power machinery of masur and minsky , including the _ bounded geodesic image theorem _ @xcite .",
    "thus , the growth bounds and constructed examples inherit a `` coarse geometry '' quality , which so far in the literature has not been used to produce the exact minimal intersection number with accompanying filling pairs for a specified distance and genus .    in contrast",

    "micc was originally created as a tool that would help in the search for distance @xmath10 filling pairs on surface of genus greater than @xmath30 .",
    "we have since realized that it can be set to other uses .",
    "for example , it was recently used to find geodesic triangles where any pair of vertices correspond to filling pairs in minimal position . as mentioned previously ,",
    "we hope researchers will find additional uses .    remarking on the complexity of the algorithms employed in micc , the most computationally expensive task involves finding all cycles in the graph @xmath344 of  [ subsec : curves ] . we know that the runtime of the process of counting all cycles in a graph is at best exponential .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the complexity of finding all cycles in @xmath344 , and thus on the complexity of the program itself .",
    "there are many ways in which we would like to improve the current version of micc . currently , micc is only a partial implementation of the algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "we plan to extend the functionality of micc to encompass the full scope of the efficient geodesic algorithm of @xcite . yet",
    "this partial implementation is also manifestation of the complexity barrier involved with the current exponential running time of the graph search .",
    "an improved algorithm will allow for more intricate curves to be studied , and parallelization of the micc would help future users to fully utilize their multicore computers in their research .",
