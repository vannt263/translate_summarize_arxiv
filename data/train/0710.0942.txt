    "models for directed polymers in a random environment have been introduced in the physical literature @xcite for two main reasons .",
    "first , they provide a reasonably realistic model of a particle under the influence of a random medium , for which a number of natural questions can be posed , in terms of the asymptotic behavior for the path of the particle .",
    "the second point is that , in spite of the fact that polymers seem to be some more complicated objects than other disordered systems such as spin glasses , a lot more can be said about their behavior in the low temperature regime , as pointed out in @xcite . at a mathematical level , after two decades of efforts , a substantial amount of information about different models of polymer is now available , either in discrete or continuous space settings ( see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "the current article can be seen as a part of this global project consisting in describing precisely the polymer s asymptotic behavior , beyond the spin glass case . except for some toy models such as the rem or grem @xcite ,",
    "little is known about the low temperature behavior of the free energy for spin glasses systems , at least at a completely rigorous level .",
    "we shall see in this paper that polymer models are amenable to computations in this direction : we work to obtain some sharp estimates on the free energy of two different kind of polymers in continuous time , for which some scaling arguments seem to bring more information than in the discrete time setting . here , in a strict polymer sense , time can also be interpreted as the length parameter of a directed polymer .    a word about random media appellations",
    ": we believe the term random environment  normally implies that the underlying randomness is allowed to change over time ; the appellation random scenery  or random landscape  is more specifically used for an environment that does not change over time ; the models we consider herein fall under the time - varying environment  umbrella .",
    "we now give some brief specifics about these models .    *",
    "( 1 ) * we first consider a brownian polymer in a gaussian environment : the polymer itself is modeled by a brownian motion @xmath3 , defined on a complete filtered probability space @xmath4 , where @xmath5 stands for the wiener measure starting from the initial condition @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding expected value is denoted by @xmath7 , or simply by @xmath8 when @xmath9 .",
    "the random environment is represented by a centered gaussian random field @xmath10 indexed by @xmath11 , defined on another independent complete probability space @xmath12 . denoting by @xmath13 the expected value with respect to @xmath14 , the covariance structure of @xmath10",
    "is given by @xmath15   = ( t\\wedge s)\\cdot q(x - y ) , \\label{e : en2}\\ ] ] for a given homogeneous covariance function @xmath16 satisfying some regularity conditions that will be specified later on .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath17^{-1/2}w(t , x)$ ] will be a standard brownian motion for any fixed @xmath18 ; for every fixed @xmath19 , the process @xmath20 is a homogeneous gaussian field on @xmath21 with covariance function @xmath22 .",
    "notice that the homogeneity assumption is made here for sake of readability , but could be weakened for almost all the results we will show .",
    "the interested reader can consult @xcite for the types of tools needed for such generalizations .",
    "once @xmath23 and @xmath10 are defined , the polymer measure itself can be described as follows : for any @xmath24 , the energy of a given path ( or configuration ) @xmath23 on @xmath25 $ ] is given by the _ hamiltonian _ @xmath26 a completely rigorous meaning for this integral will be given in the next section , but for the moment , observe that for any fixed path @xmath23 , @xmath27 is a centered gaussian random variable with variance @xmath28 .",
    "based on this hamiltonian , for any @xmath18 , and a given constant @xmath29 ( interpreted as the inverse of the temperature of the system ) , we define our ( random ) polymer measure @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 ) as follows : @xmath32   .",
    "\\label{defgt}\\ ] ]    * ( 2 ) * the second model we consider in this article is the continuous time random walk on @xmath1 in a white noise potential , which can be defined similarly to the brownian polymer above : the polymer is modeled by a continuous time random walk @xmath33 on @xmath1 , defined on a complete filtered probability space @xmath34 . the corresponding expected value",
    "will be denoted by @xmath35 , or simply by @xmath36 when @xmath9 .",
    "notice that @xmath37 can be represented in terms of its jump times @xmath38 and its positions @xmath39 between the jumps , as @xmath40 .",
    "then , under @xmath41 , @xmath42 , the sequence @xmath43 is i.i.d with common exponential law @xmath44 , and the sequence @xmath39 is a nearest neighbor symmetric random walk on @xmath1 .    in this context",
    ", the random environment @xmath45 will be defined as a sequence @xmath46 of brownian motions , defined on another independent complete probability space @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "just like in the brownian case described above , the covariance structure we assume on @xmath45 is of the following type : @xmath49   = [ t\\wedge s]\\,\\hat { q}(x - y),\\label{e : en3}\\ ] ] for a covariance function @xmath50 defined on @xmath1 . note that the case where @xmath51 for all @xmath52 except @xmath53 , is the case where brownian motions in the family @xmath54 are independent , i.e. the case of space - time white noise .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system can be defined formally similarly to the continuous case , as @xmath55 notice however that , since @xmath23 is a piecewise constant function , the hamiltonian @xmath56 can also be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 designates the number of jumps of @xmath37 before time @xmath59 , and @xmath60 by convention . once the hamiltonian @xmath61 is defined , a gibbs - type measure @xmath62 can be introduced similarly to ( [ defgt ] ) in the brownian case .    as mentioned before , our aim in this article is to give some sharp estimates on the free energies @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the two systems described above , for large @xmath29 .",
    "the quantities of interest are defined asymptotically as @xmath65   , \\quad\\mbox { and } \\quad\\hat{p}(\\beta)=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\mbox{{\\bf e}}\\left [   \\log(\\hat{z}_{t})\\right ]   ; \\ ] ] it is well - known ( see e.g. @xcite for the brownian case ) that the limits above exist , are typically positive , and are both bounded from above by @xmath66 .",
    "it is then possible to separate a region of weak disorder from a region of strong disorder according to the value of @xmath63 : we will say that the polymer is in the weak disorder regime if @xmath67 , while the strong disorder regime is defined by the strict inequality @xmath68 .",
    "these two notions have some nice interpretations in terms of the behavior of the particle under the gibbs measure ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it is expected , for any model of polymer in a random environment , that the strong disorder regime is attained whenever @xmath29 is large enough .",
    "it is then natural to ask if one can obtain a sharper information than @xmath68 in the low temperature phase . indeed ,",
    "on the one hand , this may quantify in a sense how far we are from the weak disorder regime , and how much localization there is on our measures @xmath69 . on the other hand",
    ", the penalization method explained in @xcite can be roughly summarized in the following way : if one can get a sharp equivalent for the quantity @xmath70 $ ] , then this will also allow a detailed description of the limit @xmath71 .",
    "this latter program is of course beyond the scope of the current article , but is a good motivation for getting some precise information about the function @xmath63 .",
    "we now describe our main results .",
    "our principal result in continuous space will be obtained in terms of the regularity of @xmath22 in a neighborhood of 0 .",
    "in particular , we shall assume some upper and lower bounds on @xmath22 of the form @xmath72 , \\label{holderhypo}\\ ] ] for a given exponent @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noticed that condition ( [ holderhypo ] ) is equivalent to assuming that @xmath10 has a specific almost - sure modulus of continuity in space , of order @xmath75 , i.e. barely failing to be @xmath76-hlder continuous ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "then , under these conditions , we will get the following conclusions .",
    "[ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - holder ] assume that the function @xmath22 satisfies condition ( [ holderhypo ] ) .",
    "then the following hold true :    1 .",

    "let us make a few elementary comments about the above theorem s bounds , which are also summarized in figure [ fig : exp - beta ] .",
    "first of all , the exponent of @xmath29 in those estimates is decreasing with @xmath76 , which seems to indicate a stronger disorder when the gaussian field @xmath10 is smoother in space .",
    "furthermore , in the case @xmath77 $ ] , the gap between the two estimates decreases as @xmath76 increases to @xmath89 ; for @xmath90 , we get bounds with the powers of @xmath29 equal to @xmath91 and @xmath92 and for @xmath93 , the bounds are @xmath91 and @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that the case @xmath90 is our least sharp result , while the case @xmath93 yields the lowest power of @xmath29 ; one should not expect lower powers for any potential @xmath10 even if @xmath10 is so smooth that it is @xmath95 in space : indeed , unless @xmath10 is highly degenerate , the lower bound in ( [ holderhypo ] ) should hold with @xmath93 , while the upper bound will automatically be satisfied with @xmath93 .",
    "the case of small @xmath76 is more interesting .",
    "indeed , we can rewrite the lower and upper bounds above as @xmath96 where the functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 satisfy @xmath99and @xmath100 for @xmath6 near @xmath101 .",
    "we therefore see that the asymptotic @xmath102 is quite sharp for small @xmath76 , but that the second order term in the expansion of the power of @xmath29 for small @xmath76 , while bounded , is always positive .",
    "[ fig : exp - beta ]     in function of @xmath76 ]    using ideas introduced in @xcite to deal with spatially non - homogeneous media , it is possible to extend theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - holder ] . the reader will check that the first of the following two corollaries is trivial to prove using the tools in this article .",
    "the second corollary requires techniques in @xcite , and can also be proved directly by using sub - gaussian concentration results ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not give any details of its proof , for the sake of conciseness .",
    "neither corollary assumes that @xmath10 is spatially homogeneous .",
    "one will note that no assertion on the existence of @xmath104 is made in these corollaries , but that the first corollary already implies strong disorder for large @xmath29 in the sense that @xmath105   < \\beta^{2}q\\left ( 0\\right )   /2 $ ] .",
    "@xcite can be consulted for conditions under which @xmath106 exists even if @xmath10 is not spatially homogeneous .",
    "[ cor1 ] in the non homogeneous case , the following bounds are satisfied :    * _ [ upper bound ] _ assume that for some @xmath107 , for all @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , the spatial canonical metric of @xmath10 is bounded above as@xmath110   \\leq c_{1}\\left\\vert x - y\\right\\vert ^{2h}.\\ ] ] then , replacing @xmath104 by @xmath111   $ ] , the two upper bound results in theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - holder ] hold . * _ [ lower bound ] _ assume that for some @xmath112 , for all @xmath108 such that @xmath113 , we have@xmath110   \\geq c_{0}\\left\\vert x - y\\right\\vert ^{2h}.\\ ] ] then , replacing @xmath104 by @xmath114   $ ] , the two lower bound results in theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - holder ] hold .",
    "[ cor2 ] under the hypotheses of corollary [ cor1 ] , its conclusions also hold @xmath115-almost surely with @xmath111   $ ] replaced by @xmath116 , and similarly for the @xmath117 s .",
    "since our estimates become sharper as @xmath118 , and also due to the fact that the behavior of @xmath63 is nearly quadratic in @xmath29 for small @xmath76 ( i.e. approaching the weak disorder regime ) , we decided to explore further the region of logarithmic spatial regularity for @xmath10 , in order to determine whether one ever leaves the strong disorder regime .",
    "namely , we also examine the situation of a covariance function @xmath22 for which there exist positive constants @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 such that for all @xmath6 with @xmath122,@xmath123 where @xmath124 is a given positive exponent . assumption ( [ loghypo ] ) implies that @xmath10 is not spatially hlder - continuous for any exponent @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the theory of gaussian regularity implies that , if @xmath125 , @xmath10 is almost - surely continuous in space , with modulus of continuity proportional to @xmath126 , while if @xmath127 , @xmath10 is almost - surely not uniformly continuous on any interval in space , and in fact is unbounded on any interval .",
    "we will then establish the following result , which is optimal , up to multiplicative constants .",
    "[ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - log ] assume condition ( [ loghypo ] ) where @xmath128 .",
    "we have for some constants @xmath129 and @xmath130 depending only on @xmath22 and @xmath0 , for all @xmath29 large enough , @xmath131    besides giving a sharp result up to constants for the free energy @xmath63 , the last result will allow us to make a link between our brownian model and the random walk polymer described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : expression - hamil - discrete ] ) . indeed , the following result will also be proved in the sequel .",
    "[ thm : bnd - free - nrj - walk ] assume that @xmath132 , where @xmath133 has been defined at ( [ e : en3 ] ) .",
    "then the free energy @xmath134 of the random walk polymer @xmath135 satisfies , for @xmath29 large enough : @xmath136 for two constants @xmath129 and @xmath130 depending only on @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "relation ( [ eq : bound - p - beta - discrete ] ) will be obtained here thanks to some simple arguments , which allow the extension to spatially inhomogeneous media . in the special homogeneous case of space - time white noise ( @xmath137 for all @xmath138 ) ,",
    "more can be said : the exact value of the limit @xmath139 can be computed in this situation ; this result has been established by the authors of the work in preparation @xcite .    in relation with the continuous space model considered at theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - log ]",
    ", we see that to obtain the same behavior as with space - time white noise in discrete space , we need to use precisely the environment @xmath10 in @xmath140 with the logarithmic regularity corresponding to @xmath141 in ( [ loghypo ] ) . as mentioned before , this behavior of @xmath10 happens to be exactly at the threshold in which @xmath10 becomes almost - surely discontinuous and unbounded on every interval .",
    "nevertheless such a @xmath10 is still function - valued .",
    "hence , for the purpose of understanding the polymer partition function , there is no need to study the space - time white noise in continuous space , for which @xmath142 is not a bonafide function ( only a distribution ) , and for which the meaning of @xmath143 itself is difficult to even define .",
    "another way to interpret the coincidence of behaviors for _ space - time white noise in _ @xmath2  and for @xmath141  is to say that both models for @xmath10 are function - valued and exhibit spatial discontinuity : indeed , in discrete space , one extends @xmath142 to @xmath21 by making it piecewise constant , in order to preserve independence . the fact that the limit in theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - log ] depends on @xmath124 does prove , however , that the continuous - space polymer model under logarithmic regularity is richer than the discrete - space one .    as in the hlder - scale continuous space setting , we have the following corollaries , in which @xmath10 is allowed to be spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "again , we do not include proofs of these results for the sake of conciseness .",
    "assume the lower and upper bound hypotheses in corollary [ cor1 ] hold with @xmath144 replaced by @xmath145 .",
    "then the conclusions of theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - brown - log ] hold with @xmath104 replaced by @xmath146   $ ] for the lower bound , and by @xmath147   $ ] for the upper bound .",
    "almost - sure results as in corollary [ cor2 ] also hold .    for the discrete space polymer in theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - walk ] , assume , instead of @xmath148 , that @xmath149   > 0 $ ] . then the conclusions of theorem [ thm : bnd - free - nrj - walk ] hold with @xmath150 replaced by @xmath151 $ ] for the lower bound , and with @xmath150 replaced by @xmath152 $ ] for the upper bound .",
    "almost - sure results as in corollary [ cor2 ] also hold .",
    "let us say a few words now about the methodology we have used in order to get our results .",
    "it is inspired by the literature on lyapounov exponents for stochastic pdes @xcite ; our upper bound results rely heavily on the estimation of the supremum of some well - chosen gaussian fields , using such results as dudley s so - called entropy upper bound , and the borell - sudakov inequality ( see @xcite or @xcite ) ; our lower bound results are obtained more by hand , by isolating very simple polymer configurations @xmath23 or @xmath37 which maximize the random medium s increments in the hamiltonian @xmath153 or @xmath154 , and showing that these configurations contain enough weight to provide lower bounds .",
    "it turns out that these estimation procedures works better when the configuration @xmath23 is simple enough , such as a piecewise constant or linear function . for the upper bound in the continuous case",
    ", a careful discretization of our brownian path will thus have to be performed in order to get our main results ; the resulting proof can not exploit the discrete case itself because of the different nature of the discrete and continuous environments .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : section 2 contains preliminary information on the partition function .",
    "section 3 deals with the brownian polymer .",
    "section 4 covers the random walk polymer . in order to simplify the notation , throughout the paper we will use @xmath155 to represent the constants , but",
    "acknowledge that the value it represents will change , even from line to line .",
    "in this section , we will first recall some basic facts about the definition and the simplest properties of the partition functions @xmath143 and @xmath156 which have been already considered in the introduction .",
    "we will also give briefly some notions of gaussian analysis which will be used later on .",
    "we begin with basic information about the partition function of the brownian polymer . recall that @xmath10 is a centered gaussian field on @xmath157 , defined by its covariance structure ( [ e : en2 ] ) . the hamiltonian @xmath27 given by ( [ nrj ] ) can be defined more rigorously through a fourier transform procedure : there exists ( see e.g. @xcite for further details ) a centered gaussian independently scattered @xmath158-valued measure @xmath159 on @xmath157 such that @xmath160}(s)e^{\\imath ux}\\nu(ds , du ) , \\label{e : rep_int}\\ ] ] where the simple notation @xmath161 stands for the inner product @xmath162 in @xmath21 . for every test function @xmath163 ,",
    "set now @xmath164 while the random variable @xmath165 may be complex - valued , to ensure that it is real valued , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath166 is of the form @xmath167 for real valued functions @xmath168 and @xmath169",
    ". then the law of @xmath159 is defined by the following covariance structure : for any such test functions @xmath170 , we have @xmath171   = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}_{+}\\times{\\mathbb{r}}^{d}}f(s , u)\\overline{g(s , u)}\\hat{q}(du)ds , \\label{e : cov_x}\\ ] ] where the finite positive measure @xmath50 is the fourier transform of @xmath22 ( see @xcite for details ) .    from ( [ e : rep_int ] ) , we see that the it - stochastic differential of @xmath10 in time can be understood as @xmath172 , or even , if the measure @xmath173 has a density @xmath174 with respect to the lebesgue measure , which is typical , as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a white - noise measure on @xmath157 , i.e. a centered independently scattered gaussian measure with covariance given by @xmath177 = m_{leb}\\left (   a\\cap b\\right )   $ ] where @xmath178 is lebesgue s measure on @xmath157 .",
    "we can go back now to the definition of @xmath27 : invoking the representation ( [ e : rep_int ] ) , we can write @xmath179 taking this expression as a definition of @xmath153 for each fixed path @xmath23 ; it can be shown ( see @xcite ) that the right hand side of the above relation is well defined for any hlder continuous path @xmath23 , by a @xmath180-limit procedure .",
    "such a limiting procedure can be adapted to the specific case of constructing @xmath153 , using the natural time evolution structure ; we will not comment on this further .",
    "however , the reader will surmise that the following remark , given for the sake of illustration , can be useful : when @xmath50 has a density @xmath166 , we obtain @xmath181\\times{\\mathbb{r}}^{d}}e^{\\imath ub_{s}}\\sqrt{f\\left ( u\\right )   } m\\left (   ds , du\\right )   .\\vspace*{0.1in}$ ]    we use as the definition of the partition function @xmath182 , its expression in ( [ defgt ] ) , and set its expectation under @xmath115 as@xmath183   , \\label{fren}\\ ] ] usually called the free energy of the system .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath184 is independent of the initial condition @xmath18 , thanks to the spatial homogeneity of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in the remainder of the paper , @xmath6 will be understood as @xmath101 when not specified , and @xmath185 will stand for @xmath186 , etc ... we summarize some basic results on @xmath184 and @xmath143 established in @xcite .",
