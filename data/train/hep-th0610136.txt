    "since the proof of power counting non renormalizability @xcite of general relativity ( * gr * ) , the scientific community has increasingly accepted the idea that einstein s theory is an effective field theory @xcite .",
    "although some candidates for the high energy limit of gr have emerged , no one has managed to give a power counting renormalizable theory that also reproduces the dynamical behavior of gr in four dimensions .",
    "the most general gravitational action in five dimensions has one additional free parameter besides the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "these two parameters can be chosen so that the lagrangian becomes a chern - simons form , acquiring some of the features that make @xmath0 gravity a theory with zero beta function @xcite .",
    "this particular @xmath1 gravitation theory is a gauge theory where the spin connection @xmath2 and the vielbein @xmath3 are parts of a single connection for the lie algebras @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "gravitation theories that have these properties exist in all odd dimensions .",
    "they have been studied in @xcite and a review of them can be found in ref .",
    "another compelling reason to consider these gauge theories for the @xmath7 group , they admit an immediate supersymmetric extension @xcite .",
    "moreover , the local supersymmetry in those theories is realized off shell and without invoking auxiliary fields or ad - hoc constraints .    in this work ,",
    "the topological sector in the sense that no metric is needed to construct it , of the gauged wess - zumino - witten ( * gwzw * ) lagrangian , is shown to arise from higher - dimensional gravity . in the case where the connection is valued in the lie algebra @xmath8 , the gwzw term plus a kinetic piece for the goldstone fields , arises as the effective lagrangian of qcd @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the gauge group will not be @xmath9 , but the anti - de - sitter group in five dimensions , @xmath10 .",
    "the most general five dimensional , ghost - free @xcite , gravitational action is given by .",
    "lower case latin indices @xmath11 take values @xmath12 , while capital indices @xmath13 cover the range @xmath14 . ]",
    "@xmath15 where the curvature two - form is written in terms of the lorentz ( spin)connection @xmath16 , as @xmath17 the vielbein @xmath18 is related to the spacetime metric through @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the lorentz - invariant metric .",
    "the vielbein and the lorentz connection are regarded as independent fields .",
    "the field equations associated with the variations of @xmath2 are satisfied if the torsion , @xmath21 , is set equal to zero . in the sector of the theory where the torsion is zero and the vielbein is invertible",
    ", @xmath2 is a function of the vielbein , and the usual second order equations for the metric are recovered from the field equations obtained from the variation with respect to @xmath3 .    an interesting accident occurs when the constants in the action are in the ratio @xmath22 . in that case , the action can be rewritten as a chern - simons theory @xcite , @xmath23where @xmath24@xmath25 is dimensionless , @xmath26 = -j_{ac}\\eta _ { bd}+j_{bc}\\eta _ { ad}- ( a \\leftrightarrow b)$ ] , and @xmath27 stands for an invariant symmetric trace in the algebra .    in this way , the action acquires an enlarged gauge symmetry .",
    "if @xmath28 the gauge group is @xmath29 and the action has positive cosmological constant .",
    "for @xmath30 the gauge group is @xmath10 and the cosmological constant is negative . in the latter case , localized deformations of the geometry",
    "give rise to asymptotically locally anti - de sitter geometries .",
    "strictly speaking , under a gauge transformation the action ( [ cs ] ) is not gauge invariant but changes by a closed form plus a boundary term .",
    "this quasi invariance is a source of ambiguities in an asymptotically @xmath31 spacetime , where the boundary terms that arise by gauge transformations change the action and modify the conserved charges , producing even divergent values for them .",
    "this problem can be circumvented if the action principle is modified by the addition of some new terms that do not modify the field equations but render the action truly gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "the trick is to replace the lagrangian in ( [ cs ] ) by a transgression form , @xmath32where @xmath33    the transgression form is the object which appears in the chern - weil theorem , that states that the pullback of invariant polynomials of the curvature @xmath34 are members of cohomology groups of the manifold where they are defined @xcite , @xmath35where @xmath36 is defined by equation ( [ tp ] ) up to a closed form .",
    "the gauge invariant , globally - defined expression for @xmath37 stands for the transgression form . in @xmath38 dimensions ,",
    "the transgression takes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the boundary term @xmath42 is uniquely determined by the chern - weil theorem .",
    "the field equations for @xmath43 are the same , whether the action principle is defined by ( [ tpp ] ) or by ( [ cs ] ) .",
    "however , there is a problem interpreting the physical meaning of the field @xmath44 an interpretation was proposed in @xcite , where the lagrangian @xmath45 was considered as defined in a manifold with opposite orientation to the one for @xmath46 .",
    "an alternative is to regard @xmath47 not as a dynamical field but as a means of constructing the boundary term which makes the action finite @xcite .",
    "a different philosophy will be followed here , that is to regard @xmath47 and @xmath43 as two connections defining the same non trivial , principal bundle .",
    "that is , they are related by a gauge transformation .",
    "if a non trivial bundle is considered , the integrand does not exist globally either in ( [ cs ] ) or in ( [ tpp ] ) .",
    "this non existence problem will be treated in @xcite , where a detailed study of the definition of an action principle in a manifold divided into patches , for a non trivial principal bundle , will be presented .",
    "case was studied in @xcite ] in the case of a non trivial bundle , however , the action ( [ tpp ] ) can be treated formally provided more than one chart is used . in this case , it is necessary to introduce connection one - forms defined on each chart , such that , in the overlap of two charts the connections are related by a gauge transformation , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a transition function which determines the non triviality of the bundle .",
    "replacing @xmath50 in ( [ tpp ] ) , it is straightforward to check that the action takes the form of a gwzw term ,    @xmath51    where the curvature is @xmath52 and @xmath53 this action is invariant under the adjoint action of the gauge group , namely , @xmath54    as has been shown , the principle of gauge invariance , through the mathematical structure of the theory of principal bundles , provides a compactification mechanism .",
    "beginning with a five dimensional gauge theory that has no metric in it , a @xmath55 gauge invariant theory has been obtained .",
    "this is a compactification mechanism alternative to kaluza - klein .",
    "the relation between three - dimensional chern - simons theories and two - dimensional gwzw models was early realized in @xcite .",
    "originally , gwzw terms were obtained in @xcite by trial and error , and it was later shown that they can be obtained systematically see , e. g. , @xcite .    other attempts to relate the @xmath55 gwzw lagrangians to @xmath1 chern - simons theory can be found in the literature ( see for instance , refs .",
    "however , asymptotic conditions for the metric were always assumed in order to reproduce the kinetic term for the goldstone fields , not present in ( [ wz ] ) .",
    "as can been seen from the previous discussion , such a strong assumption is not required here , the kinetic term does not appear , but the gwzw term arises naturally from the transgression form .    the action ( [ wz ] ) , usually supplemented with a kinetic term for the so - called goldstone fields , requires the introduction of the hodge dual , which in turn requires the existence of a metric in the manifold .",
    "the point of view followed here is that the metric arises from the components of a gauge connection in a broken phase of the theory , but it is not assumed to be defined a priori . in the next section the action principle ( [ wz ] ) for a particular class of @xmath49 will be studied further .",
    "the action ( [ wz ] ) describes a theory with @xmath56 gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to its diagonal subgroup @xmath10 the extension of the results to @xmath29 is trivial . in this section",
    "the indices @xmath57 take values in the range , @xmath58 . ]",
    "the gauge invariance is manifest since the connection takes its values in the diagonal subalgebra only @xcite .",
    "however , in order to describe the known low energy gravitational behavior , it is necessary to reduce the symmetry to the usual @xmath59 local symmetry present in the einstein - hilbert action . a way to do this",
    "is by replacing the gauge group @xmath10 by the coset @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for the group of transformations generated by @xmath62 and an element of the coset , @xmath49 , is a representative of the equivalence class @xmath63 = \\left\\ { h\\sim h^{\\prime } \\longleftrightarrow h^{\\prime } = e^{\\phi j_{45}}h|h , h^{\\prime } \\in so(4,2)\\right\\}$ ] . using the adjoint action ,",
    "the stability group of this coset is @xmath64 and it corresponds to the residual gauge invariance present in the theory , that is , @xmath65 \\longrightarrow g^{-1}hg\\in \\left [ h\\right ] \\longleftrightarrow g\\in so(3,1)\\times r$ ] .    fixing the goldstone field associated to @xmath66 in the action ( [ wz ] ) , corresponds to reducing the gauge symmetry down to @xmath67 .",
    "there is an interesting geometrical interpretation of this .",
    "suppose we have a six - dimensional manifold @xmath68 and delete a four dimensional submanifold @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ 6d_fig ] )",
    ".     has been deleted , as indicated by the infinitesimal loop in the center of the diagram.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    then , by considering the integral of a characteristic class on @xmath70 , the action induced on @xmath69 is ( [ wz ] ) @xcite , @xmath71 the field @xmath72 can be interpreted in terms of the six - dimensional pseudo - riemannian geometry , as a deficit angle around the four - dimensional defect @xmath73 which , as shown here , is related to the four dimensional cosmological constant . here",
    "we have assumed that @xmath72 is a constant , thus breaking part of the gauge symmetry  by hand \" . in terms of this geometrical picture ,",
    "the defect is assumed to have a fixed deficit angle .",
    "now , in order to write the field equations associated with the gwzw term ( [ wz ] ) for the coset @xmath60 , it is helpful to decompose the connection and the curvature in a way that reflects the @xmath59 symmetry , @xmath74j_{a4 } \\\\ & & + [ de^{a}+b^a\\phi]j_{a5}+[d\\phi - b_{a}e^{a}]j_{45},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath75 .",

    ", it can be parametrized by @xmath79 coordinates @xmath80 , as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is an arbitrary , real , constant .",
    "the purely gravitational sector of the theory , that is the one in which only the vielbein and the spin connection are present , corresponds to setting @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the @xmath79 goldstone fields equal to zero . in this dynamical sector",
    "the set of equations ( [ con ] ) reduces to @xmath85    here the constant @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 . excluding the trivial case @xmath88 implies @xmath89 , and equation ( [ tor ] ) implies that the torsion is zero . solving the torsion for the spin connection and replacing it back in ( [ eh ] ) , the einstein s equations in standard form",
    "are obtained .",
    "it is reassuring to check that these field configurations also satisfy the @xmath79 field equations obtained from ( [ 2 ] ) .    in order to write einstein s equations",
    "it is necessary to assume that the vielbein @xmath90 is invertible , and to make contact with a metric theory , it is also necessary to rescale the vielbein with a parameter with dimensions of length , @xmath91 . in this way , the metric is @xmath92 , the effective cosmological constant acquires its usual units @xmath93 , and ( [ eh ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath94    however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming the invertibility of the vielbein spoils the possibility of making a sensible , quantum mechanical , perturbative expansion around @xmath95 .",
    "the rescaling of @xmath96 is also unhelpful in the sense that , if no such rescaling is done , all the parameters of the theory are dimensionless , which would suggest the possibility of power counting renormalizability of the theory .",
    "here we have shown that general relativity is a dynamical sector of a gwzw theory for the coset @xmath60 .",
    "it can be checked that the same phenomenon occurs if in the @xmath10 gwzw , a representative of the group is taken as @xmath97 , and @xmath72 is kept fixed in the action reducing the symmetry to @xmath64 .",
    "the four - dimensional spacetime arises in the sector of solution space characterized by @xmath98 , det@xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "having obtained the equations of general relativity , a more detailed analysis of the dynamical structure of the theory ( [ wz ] ) is necessary .",
    "generically , as it happens with all higher dimensional chern - simons theories , the system will possess degenerate dynamical sectors @xcite . a deeper understanding of this problem would be required prior to any study of the quantum properties of the action ( [ wz ] ) .",
    "the theory changes dramatically if the @xmath72 field is regarded as dynamical . in that case , there is no purely gravitational sector with only @xmath96 and @xmath101 nonzero .",
    "however there are solutions of gravity coupled to the other fields , including an interesting class of gravitational solitons , that is , lorentzian , everywhere regular , classical solutions .",
    "a two - parameter family of these solitons will be presented in @xcite .",
