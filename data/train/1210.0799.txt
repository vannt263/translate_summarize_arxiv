    "all of our numerical calculations in the paper are performed on @xmath118 .    the attractive interaction term along @xmath4-rows , @xmath121 , in @xmath119 decouples in the hartree - fock approximation : @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",

    "we further assume that by tuning @xmath126 the renormalized hopping @xmath127 matches the pairing amplitude @xmath128 .",
    "as argued in the main text , we also take the @xmath129 limit to arrive at the effective model @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the main text .      in this section",
    "we show that the ground state of @xmath118 in the main text is @xmath41 fold degenerate for our cylindrical geometry @xcite for @xmath130 .",
    "we then discuss the @xmath131 limit . in the main text we defined a set of sos @xmath71 along the @xmath4 direction , which commute with @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , we define a set of sos @xmath132 along the @xmath7 axis , which also commute with @xmath118 , @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 where the transformation coefficients are given by : @xmath136 note that the operator @xmath137 corresponds to a spin @xmath138 operator along the @xmath4 direction in spin space , @xmath139 , based on the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "one can check that @xmath140 .    to see the degeneracy explicitly , suppose that we have a common eigenstate @xmath141 of @xmath118 and @xmath132 .",
    "if we act @xmath71 on the state @xmath141 , we get @xmath142",
    ". since @xmath71 does not commute with @xmath132 , @xmath143 must be different from @xmath141 .",
    "however , @xmath143 is still an eigenstate of @xmath118 with the same eigenvalue as @xmath141 , because @xmath71 commutes with @xmath118 .",
    "each eigenstate is , therefore , at least 2-fold degenerate .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath144=0 $ ] , @xmath143 is also an eigenstate of the operator product @xmath145 .",
    "we then have @xmath146 , which means that acting @xmath147 on @xmath141 will not generate a different state than @xmath142 .",
    "every eigenstate , including the ground state , is therefore , 2-fold degenerate .",
    "exact diagonalization studies in combination with @xmath148 order perturbation theory show that in the @xmath79 limit the low - lying @xmath149 excited states will collapse with the exact 2-fold degenerate ground state , thus forming a @xmath41-fold degenerate ground state in the equivalent spin - quantum compass model @xcite ( for a mapping to the quantum compass model see the section `` qmc simulations '' ) .",
    "the gap between the ground state and the low - lying @xmath149 excited states was found to collapse as @xmath150 for @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath41-fold degeneracy arises even in the large @xmath45 limit .",
    "we now consider the @xmath152 limit , i.e. , non - zero hopping along the @xmath7 direction . in our model , with @xmath129 , edge mfs are unable to hybridize with those in neighboring rows . in the @xmath152 limit we also observe a @xmath41 degeneracy in spite of edge mf coupling ( hybridization ) effects discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "our model is different from these works because it is very strongly interacting .",
    "even with a small @xmath29 hopping , we believe that hybridization is still strongly suppressed because of the strong @xmath45 term , which will give a large energy penalty if a single fermion hops between chains .",
    "we have performed direct numerical simulations of eq.(1 ) in the main text for various lattice sizes , @xmath153 and 8 , to confirm , within numerical accuracy , the emergence of such a set of degeneracies in the ground state .",
    "for example , we find degeneracies for @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , that are immune to small @xmath29 perturbations .      to show the existence of mfs and domains we perform a mean field decoupling of eq .",

    "the mean field theory presented in this section is in terms of real fermions but is equivalent to the mf mean field theory presented in the next section , eq .",

    "we then verify the mean field theory by direct comparison with an unbiased qmc analysis .",
    "finally we will discuss the parameter regimes of validity .    to construct the mean field equations we divide the lattice into 2 sublattices , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , along the @xmath7 direction , and decouple the interaction terms ( staggered density assumption ) .",
    "we obtain the following 4 coupled mean field equations : @xmath159 where @xmath160 . @xmath161 and @xmath162 are applied staggered chemical potentials for @xmath157 and @xmath158 sublattices . in the spin language , the first equation defines a single spin in a magnetic field while the second is a quantum ising model .",

    "if this assumption is correct , it implies that excitations for any given @xmath4-row are copied to all other @xmath4 rows to yield a domain .",

    "[ qmc_pmft_cmp ] shows that the mean field theory offers an excellent approximation to the qmc results .",
    "the large value of @xmath49 leads to bond ordering along @xmath7 ( large @xmath164 ) . but the non - zero values of @xmath165 show quantum correlations along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "therefore both qmc and mean field theory show that the @xmath7-columns superpose throughout the lattice to yield a quantum entangled ground state at non - zero temperatures .",
    "the good agreement between qmc and mean field theory therefore supports the domain picture implicit in eqs .",

    "there are , however , small differences between qmc and mean field calculations for @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ qmc_pmft_cmp ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that mean field calculations ignore quantum fluctuations ( and therefore underestimate @xmath167 ) at low temperatures and exaggerate the effects of classical @xmath45 interactions ( and therefore overestimate @xmath168 ) . despite this drawback ,",
    "mean field calculations for @xmath51 still capture the essential physics of the original model . to be specific , at low temperatures both qmc and mean field calculations give @xmath169 , which means that @xmath170 . at half filling for a uniform system ,",

    "this explains why mean field calculations are accurate in this regime .",
    "the validity of our mean field theory crucially depends on the order parameter assumption ( staggered density in a given column to avoid @xmath45 interactions ) .",
