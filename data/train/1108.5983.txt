    "cosmological magnetic fields have been studied for decades .",
    "various upper bounds have been placed on the strength of any primordial galactic and extragalactic magnetic field by faraday rotation measure @xcite , cmb anisotropy @xcite and primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite although they are inconclusive regarding its existence .",
    "recently , a lower bound of @xmath0 g has been claimed by using tev gamma - ray sources @xcite .",
    "given the increasing quantity and accuracy of the data from astronomical observations , it is important to examine various theoretical possibilities concerning the large - scale electromagnetism in curved space - time even if the effect is likely to be small .",
    "it is well known that the energy density of electromagnetic field decays as the inverse fourth - power of the scale factor of the universe when it is perturbatively analyzed around a flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background due to the conformal invariance of the maxwell equations .",
    "recently , however , it has been pointed out that in open flrw universes , the decay of magnetic energy density can be slower than that of blackbody radiation if you take into account modes with wavelengths above a certain threshold @xcite .",
    "the source of amplification is the interaction between the scalar curvature of the three - spaces and the vector - mode perturbation of electromagnetic field , which would be a second - order effect in the perturbation around flat flrw .",
    "based on that result , it is interesting to look into nonlinear effects of the magneto - curvature coupling on large scales .",
    "spatially homogeneous bianchi cosmologies are a suitable framework to generalize flrw cosmology in the limit of small long - wavelength inhomogeneities .",
    "while the model is tractable as a system of ordinary differential equations , it is fully nonlinear and complicated enough to exhibit qualitatively new behaviour .",
    "it is known @xcite that only types i , ii , vi@xmath1 and vii@xmath1 admit pure magnetic fields among all the different models of spatially homogeneous universes and they have been investigated by many authors @xcite . although the other models have been given less attention in the context of magnetic fields because of the lack of observational evidence for large - scale electric fields , we need to investigate them for the nonlinear effects described above because only type v and vii@xmath2 contain open flrw models as special cases . indeed , it is this mixing of electric and magnetic mode that gives rise to the amplification in the perturbative analysis .",
    "we expect , at least intuitively , that the isotropic limit of those homogeneous universes should reproduce the behaviour of a long - wavelength limit of perturbations around open flrw .",
    "these models belong to a subclass of homogeneous cosmological models , the so - called class b of bianchi cosmologies which is of interest from a mathematical point of view as well because of the existence of electro - vacuum plane - wave solutions that are generalization of vacuum gravitational plane - waves . in the pure - gravitational class b models ,",
    "the vacuum plane - wave space - times are found to be stable attractor solutions for expanding initial conditions @xcite .",
    "when a tilted perfect fluid , whose peculiar velocity is not aligned to the unit normal of the homogeneous spatial slices , is included , it has been shown that they are not necessarily simple attractor solutions and can exhibit non - self - similar looplike behaviour at late time @xcite .",
    "since the inclusion of the electromagnetic field introduces energy fluxes with respect to the homogenous hypersurfaces ( as does that of titled fluid ) , it is natural to ask whether these plane - wave space - times are stable in the einstein - maxwell system .    in the present paper ,",
    "we carry out a thorough analysis of the nonexceptional bianchi class b cosmological models containing a general electromagnetic field and an orthogonal ( nontilted ) perfect fluid with a linear equation of state ( we refer to it as a @xmath3-law fluid ) .",
    "first , in section ii , we reduce the governing equations to a standard form which is suited to analyze the stability of various self - similar solutions . in section iii",
    ", the dynamical system analysis suggests that the 2-parameter family of electro - vacuum plane - wave solutions is a stable attractor and possesses features very similar to its pure - gravitational counterpart . in section iv",
    ", we take a closer look on the axisymmetric subcases which still contain open flrw models as a special case . in section",
    "v , we integrate the equations analytically in some special cases to complement the qualitative analysis and to facilitate comparison with the perturbative analysis later . some of the solutions have not been found before to the best of our knowledge . in section",
    "vi , we look for a connection between these nonlinear homogeneous models and the large - scale limit of linear perturbations and argue that the bianchi models correspond to a certain long - wavelength limit of vector perturbations around an open flrw universe .",
    "the notations and terminology are mostly employed from wainwright and ellis @xcite ( chapter 1 for covariant approach to bianchi cosmologies and chapter 4 for application of dynamical systems analysis to cosmology ) .",

    "it is natural , though not always necessary , to demand that all the components of the electromagnetic field in this frame depend only on @xmath4 . in defining the @xmath15 split of field strength tensor @xmath16 ,",
    "we follow the convention of misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite ; that is @xmath17 the source - free maxwell equations @xmath18 can be written in terms of the components in the orthonormal frame with a help of the relation @xmath19 the result reads as follows : @xmath20    the isometry group @xmath21 of bianchi class b admits an abelian subgroup @xmath22 and we choose @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be tangent to the orbits of the @xmath22",

    "@xmath44 there is an algebraic constraint among the quadratures : @xmath45    here we comment on the degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamical system is not closed because there is a remaining gauge freedom as we mentioned above . in order to decide the frame to fix the gauge , we face a similar problem as was seen in the analysis of tilted bianchi class b models by coley and hervik @xcite .",
    "namely , that there is not a simple choice of frame for which the governing equations become regular everywhere .",
    "which choice is convenient depends on the equilibrium points or invariant sets under consideration and we will make use of several different choices in the present article . note that construction of scalar variables such as @xmath46 would lead to too many constraints as was the case in the ref . .",
    "whichever choice we make , however , the dimension of the dynamical system is seven .",
    "the counting goes as follows ; we take @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the fundamental variables ; @xmath49 , @xmath35 and @xmath50 are determined by ( [ eq : jacob ] ) , ( [ eq : pi ] ) and the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) respectively ; @xmath51 will be determined by fixing the gauge , which also imposes an additional constraint among the spin-2 variables ; finally taking into account the momentum constraint ( [ eq : mom ] ) , we are left with nine variables and two constraints .",
    "the purpose of this section is to extend the result obtained by hewitt and wainwright @xcite about the stability of vacuum gravitational waves to einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we follow the usual procedure of dynamical system analysis .      to facilitate the understanding of the dynamical system , it is worth sorting out possible _ invariant sets _ , which are defined to be subsets consisting of trajectories specified by certain restrictions which form dynamical systems by themselves .",

    "the physical amplitude of the electric field in the orthonormal frame behaves as @xmath146 as it should because of the symmetry between source - free electric and magnetic field . in terms of the energy density @xmath147 ,",

    ", we just have the adiabatic decaying law @xmath148 .",
    "but for longer wavelengths , the decay rate is modified to @xmath149 each of which corresponds to growing ( @xmath150 ) and decaying ( @xmath151 ) mode .",
    "if the background is milne , then @xmath152 and we have @xmath153    it later turns out to be helpful to compute the poynting vectors associated with the solutions derived above .",
    "they are given by @xmath154 this means that for each given @xmath155 , the growing and decaying modes have exactly antiparallel poynting vectors , which is reminiscent of the lrs models where the system shows different asymptotic behaviours according to the handedness of the field .",
    "let us now consider the electromagnetic bianchi models near isotropy .",
    "for the limit of isotropy , we assume @xmath156 in the dynamical system ( [ eq : ein ] ) - ( [ eq : pi ] ) .",

    "the linearized electromagnetic sector obeys @xmath159 first of all , we note that the evolution equations for @xmath63 and @xmath35 are closed among themselves and do not receive any contribution from @xmath160 or @xmath161 , which is exactly the feature of null electromagnetic field appearing in the lrs models .",
    "that is , any electromagnetic perturbation that must have nonzero energy density @xmath63 inevitably excites the energy flux perturbation @xmath35 as well , while @xmath160 and @xmath161 are independent of @xmath63 as the quadratic constraint ( [ eq : pi ] ) is degenerate at linear order .",
    "the latter two modes are also subject to the remaining gauge freedom .",
    "therefore their physical significance is questionable .",
    "fortunately , we can consider the lrs modes @xmath63-@xmath35 separately as far as the isotropic limit is concerned .",
    "moreover , the evolution of @xmath162 is trivial anyway since the equations ( [ eq : p3 ] ) and ( [ eq : p4 ] ) solve regardless of the background as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the background hubble expansion rate .",
    "this is just the adiabatic decaying law of radiation . from now on , therefore , we focus our attention on the lrs models for which we have some exact solutions and full dynamical picture .    for @xmath165 ,",
    "the generic behaviour of the lrs models is to start from an anisotropic singularity dominated by extrinsic curvature , possibly becoming almost isotropic for an intermediate time interval and attracted towards electro - vacuum , which is driven by the intrinsic curvature synchronised with the null maxwell field in the future .",
    "the handedness of the electromagnetic wavelet , namely the direction of the poynting vector , is important in deciding the asymptotic states . in left - handed cases ,",
    "both past and future dynamics receive significant contributions from the maxwell field appearing as plane - wave space - times while right - handed fields only affect the intermediate evolution .    in the cosmological context , we are interested in the future asymptotic behaviour of the electromagnetic energy density @xmath70 in the isotropic limit .",
    "that is , when an orbit is attracted towards milne point @xmath166 .",
    "this is also the situation where the magnitude of the shear variable @xmath62 takes its minimum in most cases : i.e. all the right - handed models and left - handed models with @xmath167 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] ) .",
    "phase portrait of type v and vii@xmath2 lrs models for radiation ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "all the orbits achieve their most isotropic state at late time . ]",
    "we can solve the perturbed lrs maxwell s equations ( [ eq : p1 ] ) and ( [ eq : p2 ] ) with @xmath168 and obtain the two independent solutions @xmath169 they translate into the decaying mode @xmath170 and the growing mode @xmath171 .",
    "looking at the exact solutions for @xmath93 and @xmath122 , we can easily see that the decaying ( growing ) mode represents the right - handed ( left - handed ) orbits .",
    "in fact , this is the generic feature of asymptotic behaviour of the lrs models in isotropic limit . near isotropy",
    ", the decaying rate of electromagnetic energy density is decided by the handedness of the field .",
    "recalling the perturbative result for open flrw ( [ eq : decay ] ) , the long - wavelength inhomogeneous perturbation of @xmath172 shares the decay rates and the relation to the handedness with the lrs modes studied here .",
    "this appears to imply that the super - adiabitc mode of @xmath172 in open flrw generalizes to the left - handed lrs orbit attracted towards the close - to - isotropy plane - wave solutions .",

    "[ fig : soft ] ) .",

    "the presence of the isotropic perfect fluid smears out the effect of magneto - curvature coupling .",
    "it should be mentioned that these arguments are far from conclusive since the orbits that are future - asymptotic to milne are of measure zero in the general electromagnetic class b models . on the other hand",
    ", there is no lrs left - handed orbit which approaches milne and we can only have approximately isotropic final states there while all the right - handed orbits approach @xmath166 . in this sense",
    ", the above comparison is asymmetric between left and right , in turn growing and decaying modes .",
    "however , it simply indicates that the nonlinear interaction can lead to a quite different behaviour from linear perturbations and the dominant effect their seems to be the electromagnetic plane - wave mode .",
    "it is reasonable that this nonlinear plane - wave corresponds to the growing mode of the perturbation while the decaying mode can only be seen in the exceptional orbits which are asymptotic to milne .",
    "we have investigated a class of spatially homogeneous einstein - maxwell space - times and described possible asymptotic behaviours by a dynamical systems analysis .",
    "the results are analogous to pure - gravitataional models , with the electromagnetic field acting as a kind of bridge between extrinsic and intrinsic - curvature dominated regimes .",
    "the extended electromagnetic plane - waves are stable attractors of the system . in the lrs models , we derived more detailed features of the dynamics by looking at some exact solutions .",
    "the handedness of the null field plays a crucial role in the magneto - curvature coupling in the restricted class of models .",
    "these lrs null maxwell modes appear to generalise the electromagnetic vector perturbations around open flrw with the wave - vector @xmath178 .",
    "the bianchi models provide another example of the close relation between gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "the dynamics here are surprisingly simple considering the dimensionality of the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that maxwell fields can dominate over perfect fluids , for example dust at late times in a long - wavelength limit , even though the simple adiabatic decaying law of electromagnetic energy density suggests otherwise .",
    "as to the connection to the perturbations , this analysis shows that we might not necessarily be able to ignore the vector mode with the wave - number smaller than @xmath179 in open flrw models as used to be done ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "it was already argued for scalar modes that we should take into account the supercurvature mode @xmath180 when we are concerned with a random distribution of perturbations over the sky , even though any causal perturbation could be described by the subcurvature modes which span the basis of square - integrable functions over hyperbolic space @xcite . in the case of the vector mode , it is already not obvious what square - integrable means and it is not clear which wavelengths we should include in what situation .",

    "<S> we carry out a thorough analysis on a class of cosmological space - times which admit three spacelike killing vectors of bianchi class b and contain electromagnetic fields . using dynamical system analysis , we show that a family of electro - vacuum plane - wave solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations is the stable attractor for expanding universes . </S>",
    "<S> phase dynamics are investigated in detail for particular symmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> we integrate the system exactly for some special cases to confirm the qualitative features . </S>",
    "<S> some of the obtained solutions have not been presented previously to the best of our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> finally , based on those analyses , we discuss the relation between those homogeneous models and perturbations of open friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universes . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the electro - vacuum plane - wave modes correspond to a certain long - wavelength limit of electromagnetic perturbations . </S>"
