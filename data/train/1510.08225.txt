    "since the average side chain length must be 6 monomers , this implies that molecules must contain a few long side chains which compensate for the many very short chains .",

    "the average end - to - end distance @xmath120 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : stretching ] as a function of the number @xmath46 of grafted monomers for backbones of length @xmath79 and @xmath104 and monomer functionality @xmath45 .",
    "one can clearly distinguish two regimes : in the initial regime up to @xmath121 , where monomers attach directly to the backbone , @xmath120 increases sharply with @xmath46 .",
    "then , the curves level off and continue to increase much more slowly , such that the additional stretching of @xmath120 relative to the end - to - end distance of the bare backbone is only of order @xmath122 per additional grafted monomer .",
    "we expect that this curve will further flatten at much higher @xmath46 once @xmath120 becomes comparable to the contour length , but this regime was not reached in the simulations . if monomers have reduced reactivity , the range of the first regime is slightly extended and @xmath120 increases .",
    "the slope of @xmath120 in the second high @xmath46-regime does not seem to depend on the monomer reactivity .    for comparison ,",
    "we have also studied the end - to - end distance of the corresponding dendronized molecules .",
    "the behavior in the initial regime is quantitatively similar to that of hyperbranched chains . in the second regime ,",
    "the slope is much larger .",
    "this underlines once more the fundamental differences between dendronized molecules and hyperbranched molecules .",
    "we have studied the structural and conformational properties of linear - hyperbranched copolymers by computer simulations of a simple , solvent - free , coarse - grained spring - bead model .",
    "the model is designed to mimic the synthesis of linear - hyperbranched copolymers in good solvent under conditions of slow monomer addition .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    the topological properties of the hyperbranched chain ( the chain architecture ) are intermediate between those of linear and dendronized chains .",
    "the evolution of the numbers of branching points with different coordination numbers as a function total polymerization agreement is in very good agreement to a simple rate theory proposed by hlter and frey @xcite , despite the fact that the theory neglects screening and excluded volume effects .",
    "the theory predicts an upper limit for the degree of branching , hence our results suggest that the dendronized limit can not be reached on principle . the wiener index @xmath99 is found to scale with the scaling exponent @xmath123 with @xmath124 , which is between the exponents for dendrimers ( @xmath125 with logarithmic corrections ) and linear chains ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "likewise , the behavior of the polymer size ( as specified by the radius of gyration @xmath8 or the hydrodynamic radius @xmath9 ) as a function of molecular weight is intermediate between that of linear and dendronized chains .",
    "the scaling exponent is found to be around @xmath11 , closer to the exponent of diffusion limited aggregation than to other exponents suggested in the literature ( 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 ) .",
    "however , the asymptotic regime might not have been reached , and we can not exclude the possibility that the true exponent is @xmath127 as predicted by konkolewicz _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite . at small molecular weights ,",
    "the exponent is nonmonotonic and varies between 0.4 and 0.5 .",
    "we should note that these questions are not only of academic interest .",
    "molecular weight distributions of polymers are often measured by chromatography , and they are calibrated by comparison with linear polymers of known length .",
    "thus one implicitly assumes that the hydrodynamic radii of the target chains and the calibration chains behave similarly as a function of molecular weight .",
    "if the exponent @xmath18 deviates significangly for both architectures , the analysis becomes questionable and correction terms must be applied .",
    "this requires a good knowledge of @xmath18 in the target chain .",
    "unfortunately , our results suggest that neither linear chains nor fully dendronized chains are good reference systems .",
    "we have specifically addressed the question , whether molecules can be made more compact by reducing the monomer reactivity .",
    "we find that reducing the reactivity by a factor of three has relatively little influence on the degree of branching and no influence on the scaling properties of both structural and conformational properties of the chains .",
    "it does , however , influence the prefactor in the asymptotic power law for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "hence the chains are more compact , but their behavior does not change qualitatively .    we have also studied the distribution of monomers on the side chains and found that it depends on the grafting point of the side chains on the core backbone . for long backbone chains ,",
    "the side chains that have polymerized at their ends are about twice as long as the ones in the middle , leading to a pom - pom like structure .",
    "this somewhat unexpected result of the present study will also have implications for the synthesis and resulting properties of such structures .",
    "finally , we have examined the influence of the side chains on the conformations of the backbone chain .",
    "as one would expect , linear backbone chains stretch out if side chains are hypergrafted to them .",
    "however , the effect is much less pronounced than for dendronized chains .",
    "since our simulations are done with an implicit solvent model , they do not include hydrodynamic interactions . in fluids at rest",
    ", hydrodynamics should not be important on the time scales relevant for slow monomer addition .",
    "this might change if one applies flow externally , and it might be possible to manipulate the synthesis process by applying external flows , _",
    "e.g.  _ , in microfluidic setups .",
    "for example , linear - hyperbranched copolymers might stretch in flow at high weissenberg numbers , which should facilitate the grafting of monomers to inner side chains .",
    "this will be the subject of future investigations .",
    "the scaling behavior of the wiener index for fully dendronized molecules can be estimated as follows : molecules of generation @xmath128 contain monomers in total , and the number of terminal monomers per side chain is @xmath129 . in the limit @xmath130 , one has @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "terminal monomers on different side chains are separated by a path of length larger than @xmath133 , and all paths are shorter than @xmath134 . thus we can estimate @xmath135 . since both the upper and lower bound of @xmath99 scale as @xmath136",
    ", this must also hold for the wiener index @xmath99 itself ."
