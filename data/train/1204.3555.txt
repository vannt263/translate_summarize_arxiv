    "we realized the four internal coin states @xmath33 with the linear polarization states , horizontal @xmath34 and vertical @xmath35 , and two spatial modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 , similar to the four spatial modes proposed in ( _ 27 _ ) .",
    "the spatial modes correspond to the two input ports of the first polarizing beam splitter ( fig .",
    "a.1 ) ) . we encoded the states by @xmath38 to implement our quantum operations in the four - dimensional hilbert space of the quantum coin we decomposed the @xmath39 unitary coin operation into products of multiple @xmath40 operations ( _ 31 _ ) .",
    "each @xmath40 transformation is implemented either by half - wave plates ( hwp ) or an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) .    in the basis of the four coin states",
    "the transformations are given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the angle of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , relative to its optical axis and @xmath45 a tunable phase .",
    "depending on the position of the four hwps in the setup ( fig .",
    "a.1a ) they operate on different coin state pairs , due to the spatial switch via polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) . the hadamard coin ( fig .",
    "2b+e ) was obtained for the configurations @xmath46 , while the coin used in fig .",
    "2d+e was given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "to implement controlled - hadamard gates either @xmath49 or @xmath50 were aligned to their optical axis ( @xmath51 ) , while the remaining plates were set to @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "the transformation of the eom with @xmath53 corresponds to a controlled - z operation .",
    "additional static phase factors changing the relative phase between the four coin states can occur during the propagation through the setup . however , these phases do not influence the final propability distribution due to the property of the coin operators that can be implemented with the used optical elements .",
    "given precise phase control , two additional hwps and a pbs would allow the implementation of arbitrary @xmath39 coin operators .",
    "our experiment simulates a 2d quantum walk on a regular square lattice , which means that a walker can move in four possible directions from a given site .",
    "the direction of the movement is determined by the current coin state of the walker . to implement the quantum walk in a 2d topology we use the time - multiplexing technique ( _ 9 _ ) .",
    "this method maps each individual position of the 2d graph on the one - dimensional time line .",
    "in contrast to determining the direction of the following step in space , the coin state defines a fixed time delay in the time - multiplexed system .",
    "a.1 shows the first step of a quantum walk in our system and the corresponding mapping of the temporal spread on the 2d lattice .",
    "the propagation of the initial pulse representing the walker through the setup is split into five parts :    1 .",
    "we initialize the photonic input state in the coin state @xmath54 with the starting time corresponding to position @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   after launching the pulse into the setup",
    "we perform the coin operation @xmath56 , as defined in eq .  a2 .",
    "3 .   split by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) the pulse travels through two fibers of different lengths .",
    "the resulting time separation @xmath57 can be interpreted as a step in vertical ( @xmath23 ) direction .",
    "we hereby define the transformation @xmath58 for pulses passing the longer fiber , while the pulses in the shorter arm acquire the transformation @xmath59 .",
    "additional retardation plates hereby compensate for unwanted polarization effects in the fibers .",
    "4 .   subsequently @xmath60 and @xmath61 implement the coin operation @xmath62 ( eq .",
    "a2 ) , determining the coin state for the horizontal ( @xmath22 ) direction .",
    "the step operator in the horizontal ( @xmath22 ) direction is performed with a second pbs and a temporal shift @xmath63 , obtained by traveling in two free space paths of different lengths .    as a result one step in our quantum walk setup combines both a shift in vertical and horizontal direction , restricting the translation on a 2d grid to the diagonal neighbors ( fig .",
    "starting in the origin , this leads to a spread over maximally @xmath64 positions after @xmath11 steps .",
    "after each step a time resolving measurement gives information about the location of the photon .",
    "the detection times for the first and second step of a hadamard walk are shown in fig .",
    "a.1b . at the first detection",
    "the photons can arrive at four different times , which is either the minimal time @xmath65 ( corresponding to position state @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 stating position @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) or @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . at the second step on the other hand , multiple pulses can arrive simultaneously at the detectors .",
    "independent of the coin state and , hence , spatial and polarization modes of the photons , all coinciding detections correspond to the same position state @xmath73 . in the following step wave packets in the same time bin and spatial mode",
    "interfere at @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , while wave packets in different spatial modes can interfere at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "during the time evolution , the area of the grid covered by the quantum walker grows quadratically with the number of steps .",
    "the use of the time - multiplexing technique guarantees that the number of elements stays constant independent of the size of the simulated grid . in the experimental implementation",
    "it is only the lengths of the optical paths that needs to be adjusted to the maximum number of steps that are to be realized .",
    "in addition , the performance of our time - multiplexed setup is limited only by imperfections of the optical components resulting in errors , decoherence and losses . in the following",
    "we want to discuss each point individually .",
    "a sharp limitation for the maximal step number is given by the design of the experiment . if the minimal time for one round trip @xmath65 is shorter than the temporal expansion of all positions in a single step , temporal overlaps between different steps can occur .",
    "we choose our experimental parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 without eom such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 to prevent temporal overlaps of different positions for the first 12 steps .",
    "an occurring additional delay induced by the modulator changed the conditions without inducing unwanted temporal overlaps .",
    "however , by simply changing the fiber lengths or the path differences the step number can easily be increased .",
    "the most significant source of systematic errors in the setup is the eom . due to the architecture of the modulator",
    "the applied phase is not only affecting the horizontal polarization component , as shown in eq .",
    "a2 , but also the vertical component with a factor 1/3.5 .",
    "this decreases the achievable similarities for quantum walks where controlled - z coin operations are used .",
    "additionally , the wave front of pulses passing the modulator are distorted differently for both polarizations , which influences the occurring interferences .",
    "both effects are included in the theory presented in fig .",
    "a replacement of the eom with an optimized modulator would improve the achievable similarity at higher number of steps .",
    "decoherence in the time - multiplexed setup can occur if mechanical vibrations of the optical elements influence the interference properties .",
    "typically mirrors vibrate with a frequency below 500hz , corresponding to a time scale of 2ms .",
    "the duration of twelve steps in the current setup is less than @xmath82 , a factor of 200 faster compared to mirror vibrations .",
    "this suggests that decoherence effects will not influence the time - multiplexed quantum walk up to at least 100 steps .    at the present stage",
    "the main factor limiting the scalability is given by the losses per step .",
    "these are induced by the probabilistic detection method and losses at optical elements . to counter the effect of losses one can either start with an increased intensity or use optical amplifiers , as shown in ( _ 32 _ ) .",
    "while the first approach requires an active protection of the single - photon detectors , the second prohibits the use of the experiment with single - photon sources . a third method to reduce the losses",
    "is a change from probabilistic to a deterministic coupling mechanism with additional polarization modulators .",
    "this technique combined with a change - over to a low - loss wavelength regime ( 1550 nm ) , makes the setup interesting for single photon input states .",
    "using one of the described methods to circumvent the losses can increase the number of steps significantly .",
    "to quantify the two - particle entanglement simulated in the system we assumed that the quantum walk evolution results in a pure state @xmath83 after @xmath11 steps , with the complex parameters @xmath84 .",
    "the assumption is based on the fact that the system does not show signs of decoherence for any of the coin operators , confirmed by the high values of the measured similarities .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath24 , which quantifies the entanglement ( _ 33 _ ) is given by @xmath85 with the eigenvalues @xmath86 of the reduced density matrix @xmath87 , given by the trace over one subsystem .",
    "for details see ( _ 23 _ ) .",
    "by individually measuring the arrival probability in each coin and position state we obtain the absolute squared of the parameters @xmath88 , hence no direct extraction of the phase information is possible .",
    "however , we can obtain information about the relative phases between position and coin states from the final interference pattern . as a result we can reconstruct the phase distribution with the help of the theoretical model up to three undetermined relative phases between the four different coin states and a global phase factor . by choosing the phases inducing the minimal entropy , we are able to give a lower bound for the simulated entanglement in the experiment .",

    "<S> the non - zero entropies obtained in the higher steps of the separable hadamard walk are attributed to the high sensitivity of the entropy measure to small errors in the distribution for @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigated interactions can be interpreted as long - distance interactions with the interaction strength being independent of the spatial distance of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is a unique effect and highly non - trivial to demonstrate in actual two - particle quantum systems .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the position independent interactions is the evolution of two - particle quantum walks with short - range interactions , that is interactions occurring only when both particles occupy the same position . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions can be interpreted as two - particle scattering or non - linear interactions . when utilizing a 2d quantum walk to simulate two walkers , all vertices on the diagonal of the 2d - lattice correspond to both walkers occupying the same position . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we can introduce non - linear interactions by modifying the coin operator on the diagonal positions while keeping all other positions unaffected . </S>",

    "<S> evidently , the quantum walk is to a large extent confined to the main diagonal ( @xmath31 as opposed to the hadamard walk @xmath32 ) , a signature of the presence of a bound molecule state . in general , using a coin invariant under particle exchange , bosonic or fermionic behavior can be simulated , depending on whether the initial states are chosen to be symmetric or anti - symmetric with respect to particle permutations . with our initial state being invariant under particle exchange </S>",
    "<S> we simulated an effective bose - hubbard type non - linearity for two bosons @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated an efficient implementation of a two - dimensional quantum walk and proved the experimental feasibility to simulate a diversity of interesting multi - particle quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment overcomes the technical challenges of two - particle experiments , while exhibiting very high similarity and scalability . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the flexibility in the choice of input state , controlling the coin at each position independently allows for simulations of a broad spectrum of dynamic quantum systems under different physical conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> our experimental architecture can be generalized to more than two dimensions , with the addition of extra loops and orbital angular momentum modes as coin states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this opens a largely unexplored field of research , facilitating quantum simulation applications with multiple walkers , including bosonic and fermionic behavior , and non - linear interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it may be possible to study the effects of higher dimensional localization , graph percolations or utilize the network topology in conjunction with single- or two - photon states . additionally , a foreseeable future application for our system is the implementation of a quantum search algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that , with a physical resource overhead , a classical experiment can simulate many genuine quantum features . while our experiment is important for simulation applications , </S>",
