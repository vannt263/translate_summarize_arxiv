    "we assume that the deformation matrix @xmath6 has the simple block - diagonal form @xmath7 we note that the parameter @xmath8 is necessarily quite small on physical grounds , e.g. see reference  @xcite for a recent discussion of experimental aspects .",
    "by now it is well established that the non - commutative model described by the action ( [ naive ] ) is not renormalizable due to the fact that it suffers from the infamous uv / ir mixing problem that plagues moyal deformed field theories  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we refer to the action ( [ naive ] ) as the _ nave model _  @xcite .",
    "a procedure to obtain a renormalizable theory consists of adding a properly chosen term to the action ( [ naive ] ) in order to overcome the uv / ir mixing problem . in doing so ,",
    "one clearly changes the initial model , but one obtains a consistent quantum field theory .",
    "recently , three such proposals have been made and each of them has been proved to provide a renormalizable theory ( see reference  @xcite for a short review ) .",
    "the first proposal , put forward by grosse and wulkenhaar  @xcite , consists of adding a harmonic oscillator - like potential of the form @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "a notable shortcoming of this model is that it breaks translation invariance .",
    "we also remark that the corresponding quantum corrections are hard to evaluate due to the occurrence of the mehler kernel which is quite involved .",
    "the generalization of this model to non - commutative gauge theories is not obvious , though some work in this direction has been done  @xcite .",
    "another proposal , due to grosse and vignes - tourneret  @xcite , consists of adding a non - local term of the form @xmath11 to the action ( [ naive ] ) .",
    "this approach yields a minimalist translation - invariant @xmath0-theory in non - commutative space .",
    "the third proposal , made by gurau , magnen , rivasseau and tanasa  @xcite , consists of adding a non - local counterterm @xmath12 for the quadratic ir divergence of the nave model .",
    "this procedure provides a solution for the uv / ir mixing problem while maintaining translation invariance .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the latter model , i.e. on the action @xmath13&\\equiv \\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{r } ^4 } d^4x \\left[{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\left({\\partial}^\\mu\\phi\\star{\\partial}_\\mu\\phi + m^2\\phi\\star\\phi -\\phi\\star\\frac{a^2}{\\square}\\phi\\right ) + \\frac{{\\lambda}}{4!}\\,\\phi\\star\\phi\\star\\phi\\star\\phi\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in euclidean space . in expression ( [ eq :",

    "one of our motivations is that the non - local term has been generalized  @xcite to @xmath17 gauge theories whose renormalizability still remains an open problem .",
    "therefore , it should be quite useful to gain deeper insight into the quantum corrections for the model ( [ eq : action ] ) since the multiscale analysis  @xcite which was used to establish its renormalizability can not be applied to gauge field theories as it breaks gauge invariance .",
    "accordingly we will study perturbative corrections to the propagators and vertices for the theory ( [ eq : action ] ) , and in particular the vanishing mass limit which is of interest for gauge theories . in doing so , we will explicitly exhibit the improvements for the quantum theory brought about by the non - local term .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : after introducing the feynman rules for the model in the next section , we deal with the renormalization procedure at the one - loop level in sections  [ sec:1-loop ] and  [ sec : remarks ] . section  [ sec : higher - loop ] is devoted to two and more loops , and exhibits the mechanism that removes the potential ir divergences , which ultimately leads to the renormalizability of the model  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the scaling behaviour of the propagator determined by the action ( [ eq : action ] ) plays an essential role .",

    "<S> in this paper we elaborate on the translation - invariant renormalizable @xmath0 theory in @xmath1-dimensional non - commutative space which was recently introduced by the orsay group . by explicitly performing feynman graph calculations at one loop and higher orders </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the mechanism which overcomes the uv / ir mixing problem and ultimately leads to a renormalizable model . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results show that the ir divergences are also suppressed in the massless case , which is of importance for the gauge field theoretic generalization of the scalar field model .    </S>",
