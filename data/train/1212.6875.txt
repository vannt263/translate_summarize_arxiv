    "one of key topics in finite - time thermodynamics is the efficiency at maximum power for heat engines , which has been widely investigated by many researchers  @xcite .",
    "the most elegant result on this topic is @xmath7 , the efficiency at maximum power for endoreversible heat engines  @xcite , where @xmath8 represents the carnot efficiency .",
    "recently , the efficiencies at maximum power for stochastic heat engines  @xcite , the feynman ratchet  @xcite , and quantum dot engines@xcite were respectively achieved , and their expressions look quite different from @xmath9 .",
    "it is this difference that attracts researchers attention to the following two issues : one is the universal efficiency at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines operating between two baths at small temperature difference @xcite ; the other is the global bounds of efficiency at maximum power for heat engines operating between two baths with arbitrary temperature difference  @xcite . in particular",
    ", van den broeck  @xcite found that the universal efficiency at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines is equal to @xmath10 up to the first order term of relative temperature difference between two baths .",
    "the universality up to the second order term of relative temperature difference was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , then proposed as a conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite , and finally proved by esposito _",
    "et al . _ for tight - coupling heat engines in the presence of left - right symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in addition , esposito _ et al .",
    "_ also found the efficiency at maximum power of heat engines to be bounded between @xmath10 and @xmath11 under low - dissipation conditions  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these two bounds are also shared by the linear - irreversible heat engines @xcite .",
    "the accessibility of the bounds for different kinds of heat engines were also investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , the maximum power point was proved to be unavailable for refrigerators  @xcite , which leads to discussions  @xcite on the proper optimization criterion for refrigerators and the corresponding coefficient of performance ( cop ) .",
    "yan and chen  @xcite suggested to take @xmath12 as the target function , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the cop of refrigerators and the heat absorbed by the working substance from the cold bath per unit time , respectively .",
    "they also optimized this target function and found the corresponding cop to be @xmath15 for endoreversible refrigerators  @xcite , where @xmath16 is the carnot cop for reversible refrigerators . recently , de toms _ et al . _",
    "introduced a unified target function for heat devices including heat engines and refrigerators .",
    "this target function is now called @xmath0-criterion which is defined as the product of the energy conversion efficiency and the heat absorbed per unit time by the working substance  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-criterion reverts to the power output for heat engines since the energy conversion efficiency for heat engines is exactly the thermal efficiency which is defined as the ratio of the power output to the heat absorbed per unit time by the working substance ( from the hot bath ) .",
    "it also degenerates into the target function proposed by yan and chen for refrigerators since the energy conversion efficiency is exactly the cop of refrigerators and the the working substance of refrigerators absorbs heat @xmath14 from the cold bath per unit time .",
    "additionally , the cop at maximum @xmath0 was also found to be @xmath17 for symmetric low - dissipation refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "based on the work by de toms _ et al .",
    "_ , one of the present authors and his coworkers derived that the cop at maximum @xmath0 was bounded between @xmath18 and @xmath19 for low - dissipation refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "the observed cop s for real refrigerators are also located in the region between these bounds , which is in good agreement with their theoretical estimation .",
    "these bounds were also confirmed by izumida _",
    "et al . _ with a minimally nonlinear irreversible model for refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "the above researches on refrigerators support that @xmath0-criterion is an appropriate figure of merit for refrigerators .",
    "the results obtained from maximizing @xmath0 for refrigerators have counterparts in those derived from maximizing the power output ( equivalent to the @xmath0-criterion ) for heat engines . to begin with",
    ", the cop at maximum @xmath0-criterion ( @xmath17 ) for endoreversible refrigerators  @xcite corresponds to the efficiency at maximum power ( @xmath7 ) for endoreversible heat engines  @xcite .",
    "next , the bounds [ @xmath18 and @xmath19 ] of cop at maximum @xmath0 for low - dissipation refrigerators  @xcite correspond to the bounds [ @xmath10 and @xmath11 ] of efficiency at maximum power for low - dissipation heat engines  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cop at maximum @xmath0-criterion ( @xmath17 ) for symmetric low - dissipation refrigerators also corresponds to the efficiency at maximum power ( @xmath7 ) for symmetric low - dissipation heat engines  @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a lack of the counterpart of universal efficiency at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines in the cop at maximum @xmath0-criterion for tight - coupling refrigerators when they operate between two baths at small temperature difference .",
    "our main goal in this work is to complement this theoretical imperfection .",
    "based on the expression of cop at maximum @xmath0 for endoreversible refrigerators and symmetric low - dissipation refrigerators , we conjecture that @xmath3 might be the universal cop at maximum @xmath0 for tight - coupling refrigerators operating between two baths at small temperature difference .",
    "this conjecture is proved to be true under certain symmetric conditions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics by adopting a new convention ( eq .  [ eq - newconv ] ) on the thermodynamic flux related to the heat transfer between two baths .",
    "the universal behavior of efficiency at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines is also recalculated with the consideration of this new convention .",
    "as it was done by van den broeck  @xcite for heat engines , here we consider a generic setup for a tight - coupling refrigerator shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - generic ] .",
    "an external force @xmath22 is applied on the system and inputs a power @xmath23 into the system , where @xmath24 is the thermodynamically conjugate variable of @xmath22 .",
    "the dot represents the derivative with respect to time .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic force is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the temperature of the system which can be well defined due to the assumption of local equilibrium .",
    "the thermodynamic flux conjugated to @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "then the power input can be expressed as @xmath29 in terms of the thermodynamic flux and force .",
    "assume that the system is in contact with a cold bath at temperature @xmath30 and a hot bath at temperature @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 should satisfy @xmath35 due to the constraint @xmath36 .",
    "their specific values depend on the coupling strengths between the model system and the cold or hot baths .",
    ", width=302 ]    in steady state , since a certain amount of heat @xmath37 is released to the hot bath and heat @xmath14 is simultaneously absorbed from the cold bath by the refrigerator per unit time , the total entropy production rate can be expressed as @xmath38 , which can be further expressed as @xmath39 or @xmath40 due to the conservation of energy ( @xmath41 ) . considering @xmath31 and @xmath30",
    ", we can transform ( [ eq - e11 ] ) and ( [ eq - e12 ] ) into @xmath42+\\dot{q}_c(1/t_h-1/t_c)\\label{eq - e13}\\ ] ] and @xmath43+\\dot{q}_h(1/t_h-1/t_c),\\label{eq - e14}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath44 represents the term in the same order of @xmath45 . multiplying ( [ eq - e13 ] ) by @xmath33 and ( [ eq - e14 ] ) by @xmath34 , respectively , then adding them up together",
    ", we can further derive @xmath46+(s_c\\dot{q}_c+s_h\\dot{q}_h)(1/t_h-1/t_c)\\ ] ] with the consideration of @xmath35 and @xmath47 for refrigerators .",
    "the above equation enlightens us to take @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively as the thermodynamic flux and force related to the heat transfer between two heat baths .",
    "the truncation error with the consideration of new convention ( [ eq - newconv ] ) is in the order of @xmath45 when the entropy production rate is expressed as @xmath50 .",
    "the other conventions such as @xmath51 or @xmath52 result in the lower accuracy with the truncation error in the order of @xmath53 when the entropy production rate is expressed as @xmath54 .",
    "now we turn to the generic setup for a tight - coupling heat engine as shown in fig  [ fig - generic ] .",
    "as was done by van den broeck  @xcite , we assume that the system outputs power @xmath55 against an external force @xmath22 , where @xmath24 is the thermodynamically conjugate variable of @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic force is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the temperature of the system .",
    "the thermodynamic flux conjugated to @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "then the power output can be expressed as @xmath56 in terms of the thermodynamic flux and force .",
    "assume that the system is in contact with a cold bath at temperature @xmath30 and a hot bath at temperature @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "similar to the analysis of refrigerators , since a certain amount of heat @xmath37 is absorbed from the hot bath and heat @xmath14 is simultaneously released to the cold bath by the heat engine per unit time , the total entropy production rate @xmath57 can be expressed as @xmath58 or @xmath59 if considering @xmath31 and @xmath30 , we can transform ( [ eq - entgen5c ] ) and ( [ eq - entgen5d ] ) into @xmath60+\\dot{q}_c ( { 1}/{t_c}-{1}/{t_h}),\\label{eq - entgen5a}\\ ] ] and @xmath61+\\dot{q}_h({1}/{t_c}-{1}/{t_h}).\\label{eq - entgen5b}\\ ] ] from the above two equations , we obtain @xmath62+(s_c\\dot{q}_c+s_h\\dot{q}_h)({1}/{t_c}-{1}/{t_h})\\label{eq - entgen5}\\ ] ] with the consideration of @xmath35 and @xmath63 for heat engines .",
    "the above equation enlightens us to take the thermodynamic flux @xmath64 and the thermodynamic force @xmath65 such that the entropy production rate can be expressed as @xmath66 with a truncation error in the order of @xmath45 .",
    "we note that the expression of thermodynamic force @xmath67 for heat engines opposites to the thermodynamic force ( [ eq - force2ref ] ) for refrigerators while the thermodynamic flux has the same form as ( [ eq - newconv ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath68 when @xmath69 .",
    "that is , endoreversible refrigerators and symmetric low - dissipation refrigerators share the same asymptotic behavior at small temperature difference @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we may conjecture that a universal cop at maximum @xmath0-criterion , @xmath71 might exist for tight - coupling refrigerators working between two baths at small temperature difference since both kinds of refrigerators can be regarded as tight - coupling refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "now we will adopt the high - precision convention ( [ eq - newconv ] ) to deal with tight - coupling refrigerators . according to linear irreversible thermodynamics ,",
    "we write the linear relationship between the thermodynamic fluxes and forces : @xmath72 where the onsager coefficients satisfy @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the expression of @xmath77 implies that @xmath78 is a quadratic form .",
    "thus @xmath37 and @xmath14 may contain quadratic terms due to the constraint @xmath79 .",
    "it is unsuitable to merely take either @xmath37 or @xmath14 as @xmath80 because @xmath80 is a linear form . our new convention ( [ eq - newconv ] )",
    "ensure @xmath80 to be linear through a special combination between @xmath37 and @xmath14 , which is reflected in the truncation error in the order of @xmath45 when the entropy production rate is expressed as @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , the tight - coupling condition @xmath81 leads to @xmath82 which indicates that the mechanical flux is proportional to the heat flux under the tight - coupling condition  @xcite .    with the consideration of ( [ eq - newconv ] ) and @xmath83 ,",
    "the heat absorbed from the cold bath can be expressed as @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the cop can be expressed as @xmath85 due to @xmath47 , from which we have @xmath86 . substituting this equation into the definition of @xmath0-criterion",
    ", we obtain @xmath87/t(\\varepsilon+s_h)^2.\\ ] ]    maximizing @xmath0 with respect to @xmath13 ( equivalently with respect to @xmath88 ) , we find that the cop at maximum @xmath0-criterion satisfies @xmath89 , which gives @xmath90 . considering @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we achieve @xmath93    if the model system is symmetrically coupled with both heat baths such that @xmath94 , we derive @xmath95 when @xmath96 from ( [ eq - coprefig23 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have proved the conjecture on the universal cop at maximum @xmath0 for tight - coupling refrigerators symmetrically interacting with two heat baths at small temperature difference .",
    "in addition , in the extremely asymmetric cases of @xmath97 ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) and @xmath99 ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) , equation  ( [ eq - coprefig23 ] ) leads to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , which surprisingly equate the global lower and upper bounds [ @xmath103 and @xmath104 of cop at maximum @xmath0 for low - dissipation refrigerators which are also found to be reached in the case of extremely asymmetric dissipations  @xcite .",

    "so the efficiency can be expressed as @xmath108 with the consideration of tight - coupling condition ( [ eq - tccond ] ) and @xmath63 for heat engines .    on the other hand , the @xmath0-criterion degenerates into the power output for heat engines  @xcite . within the linear irreversible thermodynamics",

    ", we can derive the efficiency at maximum power : @xmath115 thus @xmath116 is equal to @xmath10 up to the first order term in the limit of small relative temperature difference as it was obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when the model system is symmetrically coupled with both heat baths such that @xmath117 , we arrive at @xmath118 which equates the universal efficiency at maximum power up to the second order term of @xmath8 for tight - coupling heat engines in the presence of left - right symmetry @xcite .    in addition , in the extremely asymmetric cases of @xmath100 ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) and @xmath98 ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) , equation ( [ eq - effcc3 ] ) leads to @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively , which surprisingly equate the global lower and upper bounds [ @xmath121 and @xmath122 of efficiency at maximum power for low - dissipation heat engines which are also found to be reached in the case of extremely asymmetric dissipations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , equation  ( [ eq - effcc3 ] ) implies that @xmath116 is strictly bounded between @xmath119 and @xmath120 if the temperature difference is not too large .",

    "we have also derived the universal efficiency ( [ eq - univeta ] ) at maximum power up to the second order term for tight - coupling heat engines symmetrically interacting with two heat baths at small temperature difference . in this sense ,",
    "asymptotic behavior ( [ eq - copsmalt ] ) for refrigerators tightly and symmetrically coupled with two baths at small temperature difference can be regarded as the counterpart of universal efficiency ( [ eq - univeta ] ) at maximum power for tight - coupling heat engines operating between two baths at small temperature difference in the presence of left - right symmetry .    as a byproduct , we surprisingly find that the global bounds of efficiency at maximum power for low - dissipation heat engines obtained in ref .",
