    "one of the challenging problems in pulsar astrophysics is to find a consistent and observationally verified explanation for the high peculiar velocities of pulsars . these velocities can be as high as 1000  km / s and have a mean value of 450  km / s , much greater than the random velocities of ordinary stars ( harrison et al .",
    "@xcite ; lyne & lorimer  @xcite ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been put forward in the past to explain the origin of the large proper motions .",
    "since it is believed that pulsars are born during the first stages of some type  ii or core - collapsing supernovae , an asymmetric core collapse or explosion could give the pulsars the observed velocities ( shklovskii  @xcite ; woosley  @xcite ; woosley & weaver @xcite ; janka & mller  @xcite ; burrows & hayes  @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of close binary systems could also be responsible for the large pulsar velocities ( gott et al .",
    "@xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "the emission of electromagnetic radiation during the first months after the supernova explosion , stemming from an off - centered rotating magnetic dipole in the newborn pulsar , could give the pulsar a substantial kick ( harrison & tademaru  ) .",
    "another approach is based on the assumption that most of the energy and momentum released during a type ii supernova explosion ( @xmath0  erg ) are carried off by the relativistic neutrinos , as was observationally confirmed by the detection of a neutrino burst associated with sn1987a ( hirata et al .",
    "@xcite ; bionta et al .",
    "therefore , an asymmetric neutrino emission , caused for example by convection ( woosley  @xcite ; woosley & weaver  @xcite ; janka & mller @xcite ) or strong magnetic fields ( chuga@xmath1  @xcite ; dorofeev et al .",
    "@xcite ; vilenkin  @xcite ; horowitz & piekarewicz @xcite ) , may play an important role when trying to understand the origin of pulsar velocities .",
    "not all these mechanisms , however , seem to be able to produce the required high velocities and many of them suffer from the fact that they need magnetic fields of the order of @xmath2  g , pulsar periods of @xmath3  ms or that they are not sustained by other observed pulsar properties ( duncan & thompson  @xcite ) .    in a recent paper kusenko & segr ( @xcite ) , hereafter ks , have proposed a new mechanism of asymmetric neutrino emission based on resonant neutrino oscillations .",
    "the three types of neutrinos , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are abundantly produced in the core of a collapsing star which later on may become a pulsar .",
    "the matter density is so high in the core that the neutrinos do not escape but get trapped .",
    "they undergo a diffusion process until they reach higher radii , where the density has decreased and they can freely stream away . the emission surface , the so - called neutrino sphere , is not the same for the three types of neutrinos . since electron neutrinos can interact via both charged and neutral currents they interact more strongly in the protoneutron star than muon and tau neutrinos",
    "hence , the electron neutrino sphere is at a larger radius than the muon and tau neutrino spheres .",
    "the authors in ks showed that under these conditions neutrinos @xmath6 can resonantly turn into @xmath4 , by means of the adiabatic msw effect ( smirnov  @xcite ) , in the region between the tauonic and the electronic neutrino spheres and @xmath6 have been discussed with @xmath7 and small mixing . ] .",
    "the emerging electron neutrino , however , will be absorbed by the medium and therefore the resonant surface becomes the effective surface of emission of the @xmath6 .",
    "neutrinos propagating in media with a longitudinal magnetic field @xmath8 have different electromagnetic properties than in the vacuum case .",
    "they acquire an effective electromagnetic vertex which is induced by weak interactions with the charged particles in the background and generates a contribution @xmath9 to the effective self - energy of the neutrino , @xmath10 being the neutrino momentum ( esposito & capone @xcite ; dolivo & nieves  @xcite ; elmfors et al .",
    "the induced vertex modifies the flavor transformation whilst preserving chirality and , as a result , the location at which the resonance occurs is affected , leading to the spherical symmetry of the effective emission surface being replaced by a dipolar asymmetry .",
    "the condition for resonant oscillations to take place is accordingly given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino vacuum mixing angle , @xmath13 the fermi constant , @xmath14 the charge density of the degenerate electron gas in which the neutrino propagates and @xmath15 the radial coordinate .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the two magnetic poles of the resonant surface then have slightly different temperatures because the two poles are at slightly different radii .",
    "the outcome is an asymmetric emission of momentum carried by neutrinos which gives the neutron star a kick in the direction of the magnetic field and thus leads to a recoil velocity in agreement with observational data .",
    "quantitatively the kick is described by the asymmetry in the third component of momentum and estimated by @xmath16 since the total momentum carried away by neutrinos emitted by the protoneutron star is times the momentum of the proper motion of the pulsar , an asymmetry of 1% would give a kick in agreement with observation .",
    "assuming an average energy for the tau neutrinos leaving the protoneutron star of @xmath17  mev , which corresponds to @xmath18  mev , the authors in ks obtain the desired asymmetry of 1% for values of @xmath19  g. as an advantage over other neutrino emission mechanisms the one discussed here works for smaller magnitudes of the magnetic field and does not demand for any constraints on the pulsar period .",
    "if the resonant neutrino conversion turned out to be the origin of pulsar velocities , one could use pulsar observations to obtain information on neutrino masses .",
    "the implications for particle physics models would be of great importance .    a possible weak point of the model",
    ", however , lies in the fact that the mass of the tau neutrino is required to be @xmath20  ev in order to have a resonant conversion in the protoneutron star between the electron and the tau neutrino spheres .",
    "although such a mass is not excluded by laboratory experiments , it is difficult to accommodate it in the standard big bang cosmological model .",
    "indeed , the present age of the universe can be used to set an upper bound on the mass of any light , stable neutrino species ( gerstein & zeldovich  @xcite ; cowsik & mcclelland  @xcite ) : @xmath21  ev , where @xmath22 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km s@xmath23/mpc .",
    "nevertheless , this problematic point might be overruled by unstable tau neutrinos or by a better understanding of the evolution of the universe .",
    "another comment can be made in the context of the supernova physics . from treatments of neutrino transport",
    "it was found that the average energy for tau neutrinos leaving the supernova can be as high as 27  mev ( janka  @xcite ) .",
    "such a value , however , would demand for a higher magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ kick ] ) in order to still explain the observed pulsar velocities thus weakening one of the advantages of the proposed model . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to note that neutrino oscillations between @xmath4 and a tau neutrino with a mass of @xmath24  mev could , for a large range of mixing angles , help to explode supernovae while leaving r - process nucleosynthesis unscathed ( raffelt  @xcite ) . a better understanding of supernova explosions and data from future galactic supernovae could be used to test whether the asymmetric resonant neutrino emission model is actually realistic .    since none of the above mentioned points represent a serious danger to the discussed mechanism , but its implications for astrophysics and physics beyond the standard model of the fundamental interactions would be significant , it is worthwhile to examine further related observational consequences with the aim of arriving at independent constraints . in addition , the derived constraints can be used to test the viability of some of the other proposed models for the origin of pulsar velocities . in this paper",
    "we derive , using the mechanism introduced in ks , a new expression relating the transverse velocity , the magnetic field and geometric parameters of fast spinning pulsars .",
    "we analyze observational data on pulsars to see whether this relation is fulfilled .",
    "our work , however , seems to indicate that pulsars do not satisfy this relation , and therefore present data do not support the neutrino oscillation mechanism .",
    "according to the authors of ks the asymmetric neutrino emission from a magnetically distorted neutrino sphere gives a net momentum to a pulsar along the magnetic axis .",
    "it is believed that , in general , the spin and magnetic axes of pulsars are not aligned , and thus the magnetic field rotates around the spin axis with the period @xmath25 of the pulsar . from this",
    "it can be seen that a net velocity along the magnetic axis is only obtained if the pulsar period is much larger than the characteristic time scale @xmath26 on which the neutrino flux from the cooling protoneutron star remains constant .",
    "for such a case , the length of the velocity vector @xmath27 and magnetic field vector @xmath8 in the core of the pulsar should be proportional : @xmath28 in a different paper kusenko & segr ( @xcite ) apply the model to pulsars which are slow spinning at birth , @xmath29  s and @xmath30  s , and argue that this @xmath31 correlation should become increasingly more significant as the period of rotation approaches a few seconds .",
    "they claim that observational data show such an increase in the correlation for the examined periods , which would support the investigated model .    in the present paper we consider fast spinning pulsars , @xmath32  s , instead .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath26 is of the order @xmath33  s ( suzuki  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a reliable test of the mentioned correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 for slow spinning pulsars should only be possible for periods @xmath36  s which are not observed .",
    "we believe that pulsars with @xmath37  s form a better set to test the model .",
    "a period @xmath37  s is sufficiently smaller than the time interval in which neutrinos are emitted and therefore it can be safely assumed that the magnetic field and thus the net momentum vector rotate around the spin axis several times during the neutrino emission .",
    "the momentum component on the plane orthogonal to the spin axis averages out and only the component parallel to the spin axis survives .",
    "thus , for fast spinning pulsars , the proper motion should be in the direction along the pulsar spin axis . as an important consequence of this alignment of the velocity and spin axis for fast spinning pulsars",
    "one can easily prove that the relation @xmath38 must apply where @xmath39 is the projected pulsar velocity in the sky , @xmath40 the angle between the magnetic and spin axes , and @xmath41 is the angle between the magnetic axis and the line of sight ( impact parameter ) .",
    "we will see that observational data allow a test of this relation .    pulsar proper motions are determined by radio interferometry ( harrison et al .",
    "@xcite ) and by interstellar scintillation observations ( cordes  @xcite ) .",
    "in order to determine the emission geometry parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 one has to rely on some emission model for pulsars .",
    "the so - called magnetic - pole model assumes that the electromagnetic radiation originates in the vicinity of a magnetic pole .",
    "the radiation is emitted in a narrow cone - shaped beam centered around the magnetic axis .",
    "the nonvanishing angle @xmath40 between the spin axis and the magnetic axis produces the characteristic pulses every time the beam sweeps the line of sight ( lyne & graham - smith  ) .",
    "two different groups ( lyne & manchester  ; rankin  @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite ) have determined @xmath40 and @xmath41 for more than one hundred pulsars . the method used by both groups is based on the apparent increase of pulse width as @xmath42 .",
    "the classification scheme of pulsars , however , differs between the two groups and , for calculating the angles , they find different empirical laws relating the pulse width and the pulsar period : while lyne & manchester ( ) use width @xmath43 , rankin ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) employs width @xmath44 .",
    "the results of both groups show , in general , a remarkable agreement for angles @xmath45 but they can widely differ for larger angles ( miller & hamilton  ) .    our aim has been to find out whether the relation given by eq .",
    "( [ vbangles ] ) is corroborated by observational data .",
    "bearing in mind the lack of complete agreement between the different measurements of the emission angles , we have studied three different sets of data : ( a ) angles from lyne & manchester ( ) , ( b ) angles from rankin ( @xcite ) and ( c ) the average of the angles from sets ( a ) and ( b ) for those pulsars which are common in both of these sets and which have similar @xmath40 values , namely @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , it has to be taken into account that eq .",
    "( [ vbangles ] ) , true at the pulsar birth , may be spoiled by the temporal evolution of pulsar parameters ( angles and magnetic field ) .",
    "it is believed that the magnetic field of a pulsar decays with a characteristic time @xmath47  years ( harrison et al .",
    "there is also observational evidence supporting that the magnetic and spin axes become aligned when the pulsar ages ( lyne & manchester ) . to avoid these problems associated with time evolution we have selected from the data the pulsars younger than @xmath48  years and , to be even safer , younger than @xmath49  years ( lorimer et al .",
    "@xcite ) thus creating two subsets for each of the sets ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we disregard older pulsars since their present properties may be rather different from those at birth .",
    "we do not consider pulsars in binary systems either since for them eq .",
    "( [ vbangles ] ) could be affected by the evolution of close binary systems .",

    "we have also examined the case of young , fast spinning pulsars with small angles @xmath70 . in the framework of the studied mechanism",
    "those pulsars should have small transverse velocities @xmath39 ( since @xmath41 is small for most pulsars ) .",
    "for the mean transverse velocity of the pulsars fulfilling the selection criteria we obtain 344  km / s .",
    "this has to be compared with the mean average transverse velocity for pulsars without any restrictions on @xmath40 or the pulsar period .",
    "such mean values were computed to be @xmath71  km / s for 29 pulsars which are younger than 3  myr , and @xmath72  km / s for 99 pulsars without the age constraint ( lyne & lorimer  @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that there is no significant difference between the mean transverse velocity we obtain and the latter ones above does not support the model examined here .",
    "there is yet another important consequence of the alignment of the spin axis and the velocity vector for fast spinning pulsars , which has been explored some time ago ( tademaru  @xcite ; anderson & lyne  @xcite ) in the context of the asymmetric emission of electromagnetic radiation mentioned in the introduction of this paper .",
    "if these two vectors are aligned , the difference between the projected pulsar velocity angle in the sky @xmath73 and the position angle of the linear polarization vector in the center of a pulse ( corrected for faraday rotation ) @xmath74 should be either @xmath75 or @xmath76 depending on the emission mechanism and the inclination of the spin and magnetic axes to the line of sight . while tademaru ( @xcite ) found that the histogram of @xmath77 showed two peaks at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , a subsequent study performed by anderson & lyne ( @xcite ) concluded that such peaks were not present .",
    "the latter result was argued to be in disagreement with the mechanism introduced by harrison & tademaru ( ) . it would not support the resonant neutrino emission model discussed here either .",
    "given the significant increase in the amount and quality of available pulsar data over the last years it would be of interest to carry out the @xmath78 test again .",
    "this could not only help to resolve the contradicting conclusions of the previous studies but also yield an additional test of the neutrino emission model if only fast spinning pulsars are selected from the updated and enlarged sets of observational data .",
    "moreover , both tests have different sources of errors . while the @xmath78 test does not depend on the angles",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 the derivation of which is model dependent , it relies on the measurement of the rotation measure rm of a pulsar .",
    "the contribution from faraday rotation , rm@xmath79 , has to be subtracted from the measured polarization angle to obtain the intrinsic polarization angle @xmath74 .",
    "our test relies on the measurement of @xmath40 and @xmath41 but does not need the value of rm for each pulsar which can be a significant source of errors . in this sense ,",
    "both tests constitute complementary ways of checking whether the model given in ks and related models are realistic or not .",
    "we have looked into possible ways of testing the new mechanism suggested by ks to explain the large proper motion of pulsars .",
    "it was argued that for fast spinning pulsars this mechanism forces the vector velocity of a pulsar to be aligned with its spin axis . making use of this alignment",
    "we have found eq .",
    "( [ vbangles ] ) , which is a relation between the magnetic field of a pulsar , its proper motion , the angle @xmath40 between the magnetic and spin axes and the impact parameter @xmath41 .",
    "this relation should be true as long as pulsar velocities are produced by asymmetric emission from a magnetically distorted resonant neutrino - sphere .",
    "we have studied whether pulsar data actually show this correlation . to carry out this study",
    "we have had to face the fact that there is some controversy about the true values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the sense that the angles from two different groups show discrepancies for @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we have in a first step considered separately the data from each group . in addition , we have also selected the pulsars studied by both groups for which there is a reasonable agreement between the angles measured by either group .",
    "we believe that the results we derive in the latter case are the most reliable . in this case , observational data do not show any significant correlation and therefore , the mechanism introduced in ks is unlikely to explain the proper motion of pulsars .",
    "we have indicated that the temporal evolution of pulsars may spoil any initial correlation . to diminish this effect",
    "we have only considered young pulsars .",
    "another possible caveat is the fact that eq .",
    "( [ vbangles ] ) involves the magnetic field in the core of the pulsar whilst what is measured is the surface magnetic field .",
    "it is , however , plausible and accepted to assume that both fields are proportional ( manchester & taylor @xcite ; ruderman  @xcite ) .",
    "looking at table  [ tab3 ] one can see that the number of pulsars with available data which satisfy all the requirements regarding period , age and availability of emission angles as well as proper motions is small in all the cases considered .",
    "although our results cast doubt on the resonant neutrino emission as the mechanism responsible for the proper motion of pulsars , clearly one needs more data , and clarify the uncertainties related to the true emission angles , to rule out definitely or support this mechanism .    as a final remark we would like to point out that our conclusions also apply to other mechanisms proposed to explain the large velocities of pulsars",
    "this is the case for fast spinning pulsars in all models where the momentum kick is collinear to the magnetic axis and the resulting velocity proportional to @xmath34 . under these conditions velocities along the spin axis",
