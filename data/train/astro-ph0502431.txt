    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) belong to a group of objects called magnetars , since the main source of energy powering their radiation comes from the superstrong magnetic field .",
    "the first observational suggestion of the superstrong magnetic field came from analysis of the march 5th burst properties @xcite , and the basic model of magnetar emission was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the existence of superstrong magnetic fields has been inferred from the spindown measurements @xcite .",
    "the axp population exhibits a lot of similarities to the sgrs .",
    "their spins and spindown rates are similar , and recently axps have also shown bursting behavior @xcite . for a review of the properties of magnetars",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    in the conditions prevailing in a magnetar atmosphere ,",
    "the basic contributions to the opacity come from the electron scattering , free - free absorption , and the proton scattering .",
    "the atmospheres should be completely ionized during the bursts , if they are composed mainly of hydrogen , yet in the quiescence some non - ionized material can be present .",
    "the density changes very rapidly since the gravitational acceleration is in excess of @xmath0cms@xmath1 . for typical magnetar fields ,",
    "the proton cyclotron frequency @xmath2kev , where @xmath3 g , comes right in the x - ray range .",
    "important additional effects arise from the polarization of the vacuum .",
    "these effects for strong magnetic fields have been discussed by several authors ( e.g. , tsai & erber 1975 ; ventura et al .",
    "1979 ; pavlov et al . 1980 , for a review see , e.g , pavlov & gnedin 1984 ; meszaros 1992 ) .",
    "modeling the atmospheres of strongly magnetized sources is usually done using the two normal modes description .",
    "there are basically two methods to solve the radiative transfer equation : the finite difference scheme and the monte carlo method .",
    "the finite difference scheme was used to model the radiation spectra of x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also applied to the case of the superstrong magnetic fields .",
    "the monte carlo method was also used in modeling of accreting x - ray pulsar spectra @xcite and to the atmospheres with superstrong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the difference scheme method allows to construct self - consistent models of static atmospheres , yet requires a careful choice of the grids in order to resolve the sharp resonances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "imposing the radiative equilibrium is easy in this approach .",
    "inclusion of the comptonization effects is , however , much more difficult . in the case",
    "when the magnetic field is tilted , not perpendicular to the surface , an accurate solution of radiative transfer becomes extremely tedious within the difference scheme .",
    "the azimuthal angle is an additional degree of freedom , and the dimensions of the matrices increase significantly .",
    "however , approximate solutions can be obtained in the diffusion approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the monte carlo method allows to treat the comptonization effects easily and permits to resolve sharp resonances .",
    "imposing the radiative equilibrium constraints is much more difficult .",
    "past attempts to use the monte carlo technique suffered from the limited statistics .",
    "the method also allows to investigate the tilted field case , as the length of calculations does not increase strongly when the rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "it has to be emphasized that a comparison of the two methods provides a cross - check to independently confirm the results .",
    "the effects of the vacuum polarization in application to the superstrong fields have been first analyzed by @xcite , who solved the radiative transfer using a monte carlo method .",
    "they modeled the atmospheres with the temperatures above @xmath4kev , typical of the sgr bursts .",
    "they have shown that vacuum polarization leads to appearance of a broad absorption - like feature in the region around @xmath5kev in the presence of superstrong magnetic fields .",
    "the vacuum feature in the spectrum appears because of density dependence of the vacuum resonance energy .",
    "the radiative transfer is dominated by the extraordinary mode because of its much lower cross - section in comparison to the ordinary mode .",
    "the vacuum resonance then leads to creation of an opaque layer for the low - cross - section mode , which effectively changes the depth of its photosphere .",
    "@xcite neglected the effects of proton cyclotron resonance . in recent years",
    ", the difference scheme solution of magnetized atmospheres has been applied to compute the spectra of magnetars in a series of papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have mainly considered the case of emission in quiescence , with temperatures around @xmath6k .",
    "the proton cyclotron resonance was included and shown to appear as a rather prominent line .",
    "proton cyclotron resonance has also been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a monte - carlo - type calculations of the magnetar atmospheres .",
    "our main goals are to include and investigate the effects of vacuum polarization the proton cyclotron resonance , calculate the polarization of the outgoing radiation , and solve the radiative transfer in the case of an atmosphere with tilted magnetic field . in ",
    "2 we present the calculations of normal mode opacities and polarization vectors , and in  3 we describe the monte carlo procedure .",

    "transfer of electromagnetic radiation in a magnetized medium can be conveniently described in terms of normal modes .",

    "the position angle @xmath36 is measured between the major axis of the polarization ellipse and the projection of the magnetic field @xmath37 on the plane perpendicular to the wavevector @xmath38 .",

    "therefore , for a radiation which can be regarded as a superposition of different waves with intensities @xmath43 , they are @xmath44 in the monte carlo approach this allows one to calculate the stokes parameters of the outgoing radiation by summing up the contributions of the individual photons .      to find normal mode properties through equations ( [ ni]-[nc ] ) and ( [ nj ] ) one must determine the permittivity tensor @xmath45 and the magnetic permeability tensor @xmath46 . in the medium in which the plasma density is low , the contribution of the plasma to the dielectric tensor comprises a small departure from unity , so that @xmath47 .",
    "the magnetic permeability tensor is essentially @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , when the magnetic field is small , the vacuum contributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , for such a system the contributions of the plasma and the vacuum can be added linearly , and the total dielectric tensor and total inverse magnetic permeability are @xmath51 because of this , one can rewrite equations ( [ ni]-[nc ] ) in the form convenient for further discussion of normal mode properties @xmath52 where the contributions to @xmath53 and @xmath54 come from inserting @xmath55 into equations ( [ ni]-[nc ] ) in place of @xmath45 .",

    "the absorption - like features in the spectra owe their existence to the influence of vacuum polarization on the absorption and scattering cross - sections , and in the latter case the effect of vacuum on the mode switching probability is most important .",
    "optical depths for photons interacting in the resonance are large , thus their propagation through the atmosphere requires several absorption or scattering acts .",
    "absorption can set the photon energy out of the resonance , to the region of small optical depths , thus leading to its escape from the atmosphere and creating a relative deficit at the original energy .",
    "the net effect of scattering is similar  at the resonance the mode switching probability is close to unity ( see fig .",

    "correspond roughly to the frequencies @xmath215 and @xmath216 , at which resonant physical depths are equal to the production depths .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ tauz ] , at energies above @xmath217 the optical depths for photons produced at the smaller production depth @xmath193 are small .",

    "the location of the decoupling layer , estimated roughly as a mean physical depth of the last interaction , is shown in figure [ zmean ] , for the representable value of the propagation angle @xmath219 . for energies at which absorption - like feature forms , injection depth is on average above the mean decoupling depth , but",
    "the differences are small .",
    "this and the fact that the feature is shallow in this case results from the optical depths of photons which form the vacuum feature being only slightly enhanced compared to the regions outside of it , so that their propagation is only weakly influenced by interaction processes .",

    "correspondingly , the mean decoupling depths in the feature ( fig .",
    "[ zmean]b ) are also considerably reduced .",
    "note also that the high - energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath220 ) is steeper then the blackbody because the cross - section for scattering , that is dominant in this energy range , increases as @xmath221 , which shifts the distribution of escaping photons to lower energies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figs [ tauz]d and [ zmean ] ) .",

    "[ tauz]b ) .",
    "the decoupling density is also reduced at the proton resonance and is lower than the decoupling densities in the absorption - like feature ( fig . [ zmean ] ) .",
    "this results from enhanced absorption and the dominance of proton scattering over compton electron scattering near  @xmath174 .",

    "in particular , lower energy bound of the feature moves to lower energies in the model without protons .",
    "the enhanced flux at lower energies in the model with protons occurs mainly because the absorption cross - section in the electron - proton plasma is significantly reduced over the pure electron plasma value below @xmath174 ( see  [ scat ] and eq .",

    "the reduction in the proton line strength and width by vacuum polarization in such a case was also discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    as was noted in @xcite , the exact shape of the spectra and the vacuum feature depends also on other parameters than the injection depth , like the magnetic field strength , the scaleheight and the pair fraction .",

    "the upper energy bound on the feature remains roughly constant , whereas the lower bound moves to lower energies .",
    "this is due to the fact that the typical density gradients are smoother when @xmath173 is large and hence the optical depth through the vacuum resonance increases .",
    "the depth of the proton cyclotron line also increases with scaleheight , which is especially marked for the lower production depth @xmath223 .",

    "this is due to geometric effects , since at a given propagation angle @xmath229 and growing @xmath230 , the physical depth to the top of the atmosphere increases .",
    "since the low - cross - section mode makes the main contribution to the photon flux emerging from the optically thick neutron star atmosphere , the observed radiation is expected to acquire strong linear polarization . as noted in  [ npol ] ,",

    "we find that the critical frequencies in the normal modes disappear at the density when the vacuum frequency overlaps the proton cyclotron resonance .    in our treatment of the radiative transfer we have neglected the effects of mode conversion @xcite .",
    "mode conversion may occur when photon traverses a layer of varying density and encounters the vacuum resonance . at energies for which the vacuum resonance layer is optically thick in the extraordinary mode",

    "thus the mode conversion effects do not alter the results in this energy range . in the range of energies where the vacuum resonance layer is optically thin ,",
    "the low - cross - section mode photon may change its polarization to the high - cross - section one and be absorbed .",
    "this effectively increases the optical depth through the resonance layer .",
    "thus the major effect of including the mode conversion effects would be to extend the vacuum absorption - like feature further to the low energies .",
    "this effect has also been noted in @xcite .",
    "we confirm the existence of a wide vacuum feature in the spectra .",
    "@xcite suggested that the feature appears as a consequence of the comptonization effects .",
    "we found that it is formed also in an absorption - dominated atmosphere , which means that the formation of the vacuum feature is a general property expected to occur in spectra of magnetar atmospheres .",
    "the vacuum feature appears if the plasma density at the photon production depth is large enough .",
    "when the scaleheight is increased , the vacuum feature becomes more prominent since the optical depth through the resonant layer increases ( see the estimates in @xcite ) .",

    "thus the vacuum feature should be prominent in magnetar spectra provided photons are produced at sufficiently large optical depths and the atmosphere scaleheight is large enough .",
    "this second condition might be fulfilled for sgr bursts , since during the burst the atmosphere is probably lifted by radiation pressure and plasma is confined by the strong magnetic field .",
    "we do not expect a significant absorption - like feature in the sgr spectra in quiescence . in this case",
    "the effective temperature is @xmath258k and the vacuum feature would appear only as a broad depression in the exponentially falling high - energy tail , as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the proton resonance appears as a narrow line on a wider background .",
    "this line is due to the proton resonance itself .",
    "the broad background line appears because the presence of the proton resonance affects the normal mode polarization vectors in a broad frequency range around it , which in turn influences the opacities .",
    "we also calculate a model atmosphere with a magnetic field tilted at an angle of @xmath199 to the surface normal .",
    "the spectrum in this case is very similar to the one obtained for the model with perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "such field configurations are important when considering radiation emitted from the entire surface of the star .",
    "our result shows that the spectrum in the tilted field case can be well approximated by the the spectra calculated in the simpler case of the field perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this is an independent confirmation of the earlier results obtained in the diffusion approximation for the pulsar - type magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the magnetar - type fields , the spectra for the field tilted at @xmath259 were shown to be similar to the @xmath260 case in the monte carlo simulations by @xcite , and in the diffusion approach by @xcite .",
    "we present the polarization of the outgoing radiation .",
    "it is essentially linear and the influence of the critical frequencies around the vacuum and proton resonances is very small . for the case of the small production depth @xmath212 , the effects of the vacuum resonance appear as deviations from the linear polarization near @xmath108 , especially at the angles close to the direction of @xmath37 .",
    "if the injection depth is large , @xmath210 , the effects of the vacuum resonance are spread around the width of the feature , as photons arrive to the observer from regions of different densities .",
    "the proton cyclotron resonance causes similar distortions from linear polarization at @xmath174 , regardless of the production depth .",
    "sgr spectra in outbursts have been first analyzed in the hard x - ray range above @xmath261kev and the typical optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) temperatures were found to be in the range of @xmath262 to @xmath263kev @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of the sgr spectra extending to @xmath264kev have been performed for the case of sgr 1806 - 20 by @xcite and @xcite .",
