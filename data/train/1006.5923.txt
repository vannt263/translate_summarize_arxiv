    "there are various physical motivations to study quantum field theories on two - dimensional compact manifolds with a complex structure , possibly with non - empty boundary .",
    "applications appear e.g. in condensed matter physics and in string theory .",
    "such a surface is , by terminology inherited from string theory , called a _",
    "world sheet_. the situation becomes particularly interesting for a ( full , local ) conformal field theory ( cft ) , i.e. a two - dimensional qft with conformal symmetry defined on world sheets . in two dimensions ,",
    "there are , apart from the global conformal transformations , an infinite number of local conformal transformations giving rise to an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of the huge amount of symmetry , conformal field theories can be studied in a fully non - perturbative manner .",
    "this is another reason to study 2d cft .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 a world sheet , possibly with boundary , and a number of field insertions in the bulk or on the boundary .",
    "the correlation function @xmath4 for the world sheet @xmath3 associates to @xmath3 a map from the relevant space of fields to the complex numbers .",
    "correlation functions are linear in the fields and satisfy a number of consistency conditions . among them",
    "are the factorization constraints , which can be thought of as a concrete realization of the notion of inserting a complete set of states . solving a cft amounts to giving the correlation function for any world sheet @xmath3 .",
    "this paper concerns a special class of cft s , the so - called _ rational _ cft s ( rcft ) , for which there is a nice description of the construction in terms of modular tensor categories .",
    "an important issue in cft is the classification of conformal boundary conditions .",
    "a priori this is a difficult problem , except for some simple models . in e.g. the ising model , a simple spin model , all boundary conditions can be described in terms of a fixed external magnetic field applied to the spin variables at the boundary .",
    "this gives rise to a one parameter family of boundary conditions , which renormalize to three different boundary conditions in the continuum model .",
    "two of them , spin up and spin down , correspond to a non - zero external magnetic field , whereas the third one , the free boundary condition , corresponds to taking the external magnetic field to be zero . however , it is far from obvious that boundary conditions of this form exhaust the conformal boundary conditions .",
    "e.g. in the three - states potts model , there is one conformal boundary condition which can not be related in a simple way to the external magnetic field @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the conformal boundary conditions for a specific class of theories are classified by a semi - simple commutative associative complex algebra , the so - called classifying algebra @xmath2 . in @xcite we establish the existence of the classifying algebra for any rcft .",
    "the structure constants of @xmath2 are obtained by comparing bulk and boundary factorization of a disc with two bulk field insertions .",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath2 are the so - called reflection coefficients .",
    "the reflection coefficients , which appear e.g. in @xcite , are collected in so - called boundary states .",
    "the boundary states contain essential physical information regarding boundary conditions , such as ground state degeneracies @xcite and ramond - ramond charges of string compactifications @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been shown , for some special classes of models , see e.g. @xcite , that the reflection coefficients appears naturally in the annulus partition functions . in this paper",
    "we show , by applying bulk factorization , that essential information concerning the annulus partition functions for any rcft is contained in @xmath2 and its representation theory .",
    "thus the appearance of the reflection coefficients in the annulus coefficients of a rcft is a generic phenomenon .",
    "the symmetries of a cft can be encoded in the mathematical structure of a conformal vertex algebra @xmath5 , by physicists often referred to as the chiral algebra .",
    "a rational cft is distinguished by the property that the strictification of the category @xmath6 of representations of @xmath5 is a modular tensor category @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation functions of a rational cft satisfy holomorphic factorization , e.g. the correlation function @xmath4 is a vector in the space of conformal blocks on the double @xmath7 .",
    "the double is obtained from @xmath3 by taking the orientation bundle over @xmath3 and pairwise identify points over the boundary @xmath8 : [ double ] : = ( ) /~,(x,)~(x,-)x .",
    "the double is in particular a complex curve , thus we can study the space of conformal blocks on @xmath7 .",
    "the solution of a rational conformal field theory , with given chiral algebra @xmath5 , can be split off into two separate parts , a complex - analytic and a purely algebraic part .",
    "the first problem amounts to solving the chiral theory on @xmath7 , i.e. to obtain the space of conformal blocks of @xmath5 on @xmath7 .",
    "the second problem amounts to selecting , from the space of conformal blocks , the particular vector @xmath4 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the second problem . as a consequence",
    ", we will be able to restrict to topological world sheets . a topological world sheet @xmath9 is obtained from @xmath3 by suppressing the conformal structure .",
    "this paper is formulated in the framework of the tft - construction .",
    "the tft - construction provides all solutions to a rational cft with given chiral algebra @xmath5 .",
    "a rational cft , with chiral algebra @xmath5 , is constructed from the modular tensor category @xmath0 , which is the strictification of @xmath6 , and a distinguished object @xmath1 in @xmath0 , with the structure of a symmetric special frobenius algebra .",
    "in fact , the rational cft s with chiral algebra @xmath5 are classified by morita classes of simple symmetric special frobenius algebras in @xmath0 .",
    "we will not discuss vertex algebras explicitly , we will rather work in the framework of an abstract modular tensor category .",
    "thereby we cover all rational cft s simultaneously .",
    "a crucial tool in the tft - construction is a topological field theory .",
    "a topological field theory is a tensor functor @xmath10 from the category @xmath11 to the category @xmath12 of finite - dimensional complex vector spaces .",
    "the morphisms of @xmath11 are cobordisms , i.e. three - manifolds with embedded ribbon graph .",
    "the tft - construction provides the correlator as the invariant of such a cobordism .",
    "the correlator of a topological world sheet @xmath9 is an element in a finite dimensional vector space .",
    "this space can be identified with the space of conformal blocks on the world sheet @xmath3 , obtained by endowing @xmath13 with a complex structure .",
    "thus the structure constants of the expansion of such a correlator are the same as the ones for the correlation function . however",
    ", a certain quotient of correlators will only depend on the conformal equivalence class of the metric , see @xcite .",
    "it is these quotients that can be obtained via the tft - construction . ] .    in section 2",
    "we review some basic facts concerning modular tensor categories and the tft - construction .",
    "section 3 describes how the factorization constraints are implemented on a specific correlator .",
    "there are 2 types of factorization , bulk and boundary factorization .",
    "boundary factorization is covered only briefly since we do not need it for the calculations in this paper . in section 4",
    "we use bulk factorization to show how @xmath2 and its representation theory appear in the annulus partition functions .",
    "a modular tensor category @xmath0 is in particular an abelian , semisimple , @xmath14-linear , ribbon category .",
