    "scattering of antiprotons off polarized nuclei can be used to produce a beam of polarized antiprotons by exploiting the so - called spin - filtering effect @xcite .",
    "the pax collaboration intends to utilize scattering of antiprotons off a polarized @xmath8h target in rings @xcite as the basic source for antiproton polarization buildup at an upgrade of the fair facility in darmstadt . in view of the limited information on the spin dependence of the @xmath9 force ,",
    "the interaction of antiprotons with a polarized deuteron is also of interest for the issue of the antiproton polarization buildup .    in a recent paper @xcite we considered @xmath0 scattering within the glauber theory of multi - step scattering @xcite , taking into account the full spin - dependence of the elementary @xmath1 scattering amplitudes .",
    "predictions for various observables were given for antiproton beam energies from 50 to 300 mev employing @xmath1 amplitudes generated from @xmath2 potentials developed by the jlich group @xcite .",
    "specifically , the @xmath9 amplitudes were taken from the models a(box ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and d described in ref .",
    "both models provide a very good overall reproduction of the low- and intermediate energy @xmath2 data as documented in those works . on the other hand ,",
    "there are clearly visible deficiencies in the description of spin - dependent observables like the analyzing powers , for elastic @xmath3 scattering but in particular for the @xmath10 reaction@xcite .    while we were preparing our work @xcite an updated version of the nijmegen partial - wave analysis",
    "was presented by zhou and timmermans @xcite . for this new analysis",
    "concrete values of the resulting phase shifts and inelasticities are provided in the publication so that we can reconstruct the corresponding @xmath11 amplitudes and we can employ them for a calculation of @xmath0 scattering within the glauber theory . as demonstrated in @xcite",
    "the @xmath11 amplitudes based on those phase - shift parameters yield an excellent description of the experimental data included in the database of the analysis .",
    "thus , they constitute definitely the best and most reliable representation of the @xmath11 interaction , and specifically of its spin dependence , that we have at hand at the moment .",
    "therefore , it is instructive to investigate the implications of those amplitudes on the various @xmath0 scattering observables that we considered in our recent paper @xcite . of particular interest are , of course , spin observables such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "equally interesting are predictions for the efficiency of the polarization buildup for antiprotons in a storage ring for scattering off a deuteron target .",
    "those are the parameters relevant for the planned experiments of the pax collaboration and it is rather helpful for the preparations of a future experiment to have values at one s disposal that are as well - founded as possible .",
    "corresponding results are presented in this brief report . in the following we use",
    "the abbreviation `` zt '' when we refer to the amplitudes of zhou and timmermans @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath0 scattering was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite utilizing , however , the results from the old nijmegen @xmath12 partial - wave analysis @xcite from 1994 .",
    "we study @xmath0 scattering within the glauber theory based on the single- and double @xmath1 scattering mechanisms . the full spin dependence of the elementary @xmath1 scattering amplitudes is taken into account and both the @xmath13- and @xmath14-wave components of the deuteron",
    "are considered .",
    "details of the formalism can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we also provide definitions of the considered @xmath0 observables in terms of the twelve invariant amplitudes that arise for spin 1/2 + 1 scattering .",
    "the @xmath2 amplitudes of the new analysis of zhou and timmermans are reconstructed from the phase shifts and inelasticity parameters as given in their tables viii - x @xcite .",
    "those values are obtained under the assumption of isospin symmetry and , therefore , match our study where likewise isospin symmetry is imposed for the hadronic amplitude . since",
    "only partial waves up to a total angular momentum of @xmath15 are listed we considered two options for supplementing the contributions from higher partial waves , namely ( a ) one - pion exchange and ( b ) higher partial waves predicted by the jlich model a. it turned out that there is very little difference in the resulting @xmath2 amplitudes , at least up to @xmath16 mev / c , which is the highest momentum considered in our study . actually , even in a test calculation of differential cross sections and analyzing powers based on the phase shifts at @xmath17 mev / c with our reconstructed amplitudes we obtained nice agreement with the results for @xmath12 elastic and @xmath18 charge - exchange scattering ( at @xmath19 mev / c ) displayed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "following our previous work we use a gaussian ansatz for representing the amplitudes generated from the @xmath11 phase - shift parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite in analytical form .",
    "again , we aim at an excellent reproduction of the original amplitudes over the whole angular range . in the @xmath20 calculation",
    "we introduce a cutoff that suppresses the amplitudes in the backward hemisphere as described in @xcite and we vary the cutoff angle in the @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the bands in the figures represent the variation of the @xmath0 observables due to the procedure described above . as argued in @xcite , we regard these bands as a sensible guideline for estimating the angular region where the glauber theory is able to provide solid results for a specific observable and where this approach starts to fail .",
    "we want to remind the reader that contributions from large angles are in contradiction with the basic approximations underlying the glauber model and , thus , any sizable influence from them undoubtedly marks the breakdown of this approach .",
    "first let us consider the differential cross section at 179 mev where data are available @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ pd179q2 ] .",
    "our glauber calculation describes the first diffractive peak quite well - for amplitudes taken from the @xmath12 partial - wave analysis as well as for those generated from the @xmath11 model d of the jlich group .",
    "( the result for the former is based on the amplitudes at 175.3 mev ( @xmath21 mev / c ) listed in ref .",
    "model d also explains the first minimum in the differential cross section , located at @xmath22 ( gev / c)@xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , and the onset of the second maximum whereas here the zt @xmath11 amplitudes lead to an overestimation .",
    "the obvious strong disagreement with the data at larger transferred momenta , @xmath25 ( gev / c)@xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath26 , lies already in the region where the increase in the band widths indicates that our glauber results are not reliable anymore , cf .",
    "the corresponding discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in case of the vector analyzing powers @xmath5 and @xmath4",
    "our investigation @xcite had indicated a strong model dependence .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the corresponding predictions for the zt amplitudes differ from those of the jlich models as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ay179 ] .",
    "indeed , the zt amplitudes yield significantly larger values for those observables .",
    "the tensor analyzing powers @xmath6 and @xmath7 were found to be much less sensitive to differences in the @xmath2 amplitudes because these observables are dominated by the spin - independent amplitudes . for the zt amplitudes we obtain results that exhibit an angular dependence that is very similar to the one predicted by the jlich models . indeed",
    "the results almost coincide with those for model a and , therefore , we do not display the latter for reasons of clarity .    the total @xmath0 cross section is defined by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unit vector in the direction of the antiproton beam , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the polarization vector of the antiproton ( deuteron ) , and @xmath31 is the tensor polarization of the deuteron ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "corresponding results are presented in figs .",
    "[ totsigm0 ] and [ totsigm1 ] .",
    "it is obvious that the unpolarized cross section @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ totsigm0 ] ) based on the zt amplitudes is somewhat smaller than those for the jlich @xmath11 models .",
    "it is also below the bulk of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "a closer inspection revealed that this difference is mainly due to a qualitative difference in the magnitude of the isospin @xmath34 amplitude . in the jlich models @xmath35 is about 10 - 15 % larger than the result we obtain for the @xmath34 amplitude of ref .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath36 cross sections are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , so that interferences between the @xmath39 and @xmath34 amplitudes play a role and the ( absolute ) size of the isospin amplitudes is not so tightly constrained .",
    "however , the @xmath0 scattering cross section is given ( in the simple impulse approximation @xcite ) by @xmath40 .",
    "note that the calculation for the zt amplitudes was done at those energies ( marked by `` @xmath41 '' in the figures ) for which the values are listed in @xcite . to guide the eye we connected those points with a dotted line .",
    "predictions for the spin - dependent @xmath0 cross section @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are shown in fig .  [ totsigm1 ] . again , as for the analyzing powers discussed above , we see sizable differences in the results based on the zt amplitudes to the ones obtained from the @xmath11 amplitudes of the jlich models .",
    "specifically , those cross sections are larger ( @xmath42 ) or even of oppositive sign ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "only the tensor - polarized cross section @xmath44 turns out to be similar for all three considered @xmath11 amplitudes .",
    "the quantity relevant for the efficiency of the polarization buildup is the polarization degree @xmath45 at the beam life time @xmath46 @xcite . with our definition of @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath47 where the unit vector @xmath48 is directed along the target polarization vector @xmath49 .",
    "results for the transversal polarization @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and for the longitudinal polarization @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fmerit ] for @xmath54 . obviously , there are sizable differences in the predicted values for the considered @xmath11 amplitudes .",
    "but the overall magnitude  which is decisive for the polarization buildup  is comparable and in the order of 5 - 10 % in the energy region considered .",
    "with regard to the calculation based on the @xmath11 amplitudes from the partial - wave analysis @xcite we want to point out that our results for the polarization degree for a deuterium target are smaller than those for a hydrogen target , found to be around 20 % in ref .",
    "@xcite for the acceptance angle of 20 mrad considered by us .",
    "moreover , they are much smaller than the large values of around 30 % reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in a @xmath0 calculation that utilizes the old nijmegen @xmath11 partial - wave analysis @xcite .",
