    "we measure 0.7 \" full width half maximum intensity on our spectra .",
    "the airmass was approximately 1.5 at the time .",
    "the slit was oriented to the parallactic angle ; we note that imacs also includes an atmospheric dispersion compensator , so our relative fluxes from the red to the blue should be good despite the modestly large airmass .",
    "flat - fielding was performed by means of a series of flats obtained on a projector screen ; wavelength calibration ( he - ne - ar lamps ) were obtained immediately after the three exposures .",
    "a large number of bias frames ( 60 ) were averaged and used to remove residual two dimensional structure after overscan correction and trimming .",
    "in addition to the observation of woh g64 , observations of three lmc rsgs with known radial velocities from massey & olsen ( 2003 ) were obtained immediately prior to the woh g64 observation in order to check on lmc membership for woh g64 ( see   [ sec : mem ] ) .",
    "those exposures were 60 sec long , and obtained at the parallactic angle .",
    "each observation was also followed by a henear comparison arc .    throughout the course of this and",
    "several other nights we also observed spectrophotometric standard stars from the list of hamuy et al .",
    "the spectrograph slit was oriented to the parallactic angle for these observations as well .",
    "some of those data were obtained under non - photometric conditions , but all of the standards data were combined , with a grey shift calculated such that the average through - put agreed with the observation with the highest through - put .",
    "the resulting residuals from a high - order fit were a few hundrenths of a magnitude , as expected .",
    "the sensitivity curve we derived was applied to the woh g64 observation .",
    "all data were processed using iraf .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an optimal extraction algorithm , with deviant pixels identified and rejected based upon the assumption of a smoothly varying spatial profile .",
    "before investigating the physical properties of woh g64 , we first wished to confirm that it was indeed a rsg member of the magellanic clouds , rather than an unusual foreground giant .",
    "elias et al .  ( 1986 ) measure a radial velocity of 315 km s@xmath4 from several nebular emission lines , but state that the velocity zero point is uncertain by 50 km s@xmath4 , and cite this as evidence of membership in the lmc .",
    "however , this really only demonstrates that the star is not a foreground dwarf ; a halo giant will have a similar velocity to the lmc s systematic velocity , as it is due mainly to the reflex motion of the sun .",
    "this value can also be compared to the @xmath12 270 - 278 km s@xmath4 velocity of the maser emission reported by marshall et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is more in line with our expectations of the lmc s rotation ( olsen & massey 2007 ) .",
    "finally , van loon et al . ( 1998 ) use the ca ii triplet to measure a heliocentric velocity of @xmath12 300 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we can use our spectra to determine if the star s radial velocity is consistent with the kinematics of other rsgs in the lmc .",
    "we measured the radial velocity of woh g64 by cross correlating our spectra against those of three lmc rsgs with accurate velocities measured by massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , [ m2002 ] lmc 022204 , 024014 , and 024987 .",
    "for this , we used the ` fxcor ` task in the iraf ` rv ` package , restricting the cross - correlation region to 8450 - 8700a , which contains the very strong triplet lines at @xmath13 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the spectra were first normalized to unity , and then a value of 1 subtracted so that only spectral features add signal to the cross - correlation .",
    "we used the three individual woh g64 spectra in order to determine the internal consistency of our measurements ; in addition we cross - correlated each of the radial velocity  standards \" against each other .",
    "these tests revealed that the maximum difference seen in cross - correlating any two calibrating stars against themselves was 10 km s@xmath4 , giving us assurance that the velocity we determine with the combination of the three would be a few km / sec .",
    "we expect to be able to centroid each line to about 10% of the spectral resolution element or better , and so this is consistent since the 4.3  resolution translates to about 150 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we obtained a radial velocity of 294 @xmath0 2 km s@xmath4 , where the error refers to the formal standard deviation of the mean , and reflects the good agreement in cross - correlating the stars used for the velocity determinations against themselves .",
    "given this star s location in the lmc , we expect a heliocentric velocity of 263 km s@xmath4 due to contributions from the lmc s space motion relative to the sun and its internal rotation , using a kinematic model fit to lmc carbon stars ( olsen & massey 2007 ) .",
    "although our measured velocity for woh g64 is @xmath1230 km s@xmath4 higher than that of the carbon stars , it is still entirely consistent with lmc membership , as seen in figure [ fig : kinematics ] . the difference in velocity can be attributed to the fact that the lmc s rsgs appear to exhibit @xmath1245 km s@xmath4 faster rotation than the carbon stars ( whether this is because either the lmc s rsgs or its carbon stars have been kinematically disturbed by external forces is not yet clear ; see olsen & massey 2007 ) . in any case ,",
    "woh g64 s velocity is indeed typical for an lmc rsg at its position .",
    "elias et al .  ( 1986 ) obtain a 6200   - 9200  spectrum of woh g64 from the ctio blanco 4-meter and rc spectrograph .",
    "based on this spectrum they assign the star a type of @xmath12 m7.5 , and derive an m@xmath14 of @xmath15 ( adopting a distance modulus of 18.6 ) by integrating over ir ground - based and iras data and assuming the ( @xmath1 ) color to be @xmath12 8 ; we correct this to m@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) adopting a distance modulus of 18.5 ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",

    "we have measured the radial velocities of the emission lines by fitting gaussians to them , and find an average ( heliocentric ) value of @xmath68 km s@xmath4 , where the error refers to the standard deviation of the mean ; radial velocities for each of these features are given in table [ tab : elines ] .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the @xmath69 km s@xmath4 we measure for the star itself (   [ sec : mem ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the redshift of these emission lines can be explained in part by scattering of the spectrum by an extended , expanding dust shell , a phenomenon that has previously been observed and described in red supergiants ( romanik & leung 1981 , and references therein ) .",
    "we measure the integrated fluxes of these emission lines , and correct these values for extinction based on the h@xmath11/h@xmath67 emission line ratio , assuming the balmer decrement for case b recombination ( h@xmath11/h@xmath67 = 2.87 , following osterbrock 1989 ) and the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law .",
    "we calculate an @xmath29 = 1.90 , very different than the value determined for the star from our spectral fitting ; however , it is not surprising that the gas we observe has a net extinction that is lower than the star , and this is in fact consistent with it forming in the outer part of the dust shell .",
    "the observed and dereddened integrated fluxes are included in table [ tab : elines ] .    with these dereddened fluxes we are able to calculate several common emission line diagnostic ratios , notable log ( [ ] @xmath286584/h@xmath11 ) = 0.05 , log ( [ ] @xmath286300/h@xmath11 ) = @xmath70 , and log ( [ ] @xmath285007/h@xmath67 ) = @xmath71 ) , and a lower limit of log([]/h@xmath11 ) @xmath72 ( see baldwin et al .",
    "1981 for a detailed discussion of these diagnostics ) .",
    "the value of the [ ] /h@xmath11 ratio is much higher than the minimum value at which [ ] is considered  present \" , defined in baldwin et al .",
    "( 1981 ) as log ( [ ] @xmath286300/h@xmath11 ) = @xmath73 .",
    "this high relative strength of the [ ] line implies that the dominant source of ionization is likely shock heating .",
    "this is also implied by the relatively high lower limit of the log([]/h@xmath11 ) @xmath72 ratio in our spectrum ( see , for example , allen et al . 1999 , 2008 ) , and we thank the anonymous referee for pointing this out . however , this is not the only explanation , as called to our attention in thoughtful comments by nathan smith ( 2009 , private communication ) and phil bennett ( 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "bennett argues in particular that such nebular emission is typical of vv cep - like systems , i.e. , formed by ionization by a hot companion , but see discussion below .",
    "we also find that nitrogen is highly enhanced in the nebula ; if we use the standard galaxy diagnostics of pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) , which rely upon a constant n / o ratio , we would derive a 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.9 , considerably in excess of the 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.4 that is typical of hii regions in the lmc ( russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "but , far more likely is the possibility that n is simply enhanced in this gas . without other line diagnostics ( such as [ ] @xmath283727 , [ ] @xmath284363 , or [ ] @xmath286717 ) we lack a quantitative knowledge of the oxygen abundance , electron density , and electron temperature .",
    "such n enrichment is a signature of many shells and rings around massive stars , such as sher 25 ( brandner et al .  1997 ,",
    "hendry et al .  2008 ) .",
    "sher 25 is a blue supergiant , but is thought to be in a blue loop phase , with the high n - enriched gas ejected during a prior evolutionary phase ( brandner et al .",
    "1997 ; see also discussion in smartt et al .",
    "2002 and hendry et al .",
    "other such examples are also known ( hunter et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we note that [ ] @xmath74 is strongly present .",
    "like the [ ] @xmath75 line , this doublet is also collisionally excited ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and we take its strength as further evidence of shocks and nitrogen enrichment , consistent with the above .",
    "we have used the marcs stellar atmospheres and moderate resolution spectrophotometry and broad - band photometry to investigate the physical properties of the enigmatic supergiant woh g64 . in our addition our study conclusively shows that the star is a supergiant member of the lmc , rather than ( say ) an unusual giant star in our own galaxy s halo .",
    "our analysis finds an effective temperature of 3400 @xmath0 25 k , considerably warmer than previous studies have adopted . with our parameters from spectral fitting , and taking into account the additional flux contribution at @xmath31 from the asymmetric circumstellar dust envelope",
    "as seen in ohnaka et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we determine m@xmath76 for woh g64 . while woh g64 has previously been cited as having a t@xmath6 and m@xmath14 that would make it the largest rsg known , those parameters have also placed it at odds with the position of the evolutionary tracks on the h - r diagram . by contrast ,",
    "our parameters place woh g64 closer to the predictions of stellar evolutionary theory and in good agreement with other rsgs in the lmc .",
    "we determine a stellar radius of @xmath3 = 1540 which , while still the largest in the lmc , is now in good agreement with the size of other large rsgs ( @xmath77r@xmath5 ; paper i ) , given that such radii have 5% errors or larger .",
    "the question still remains as to whether or not woh g64 is a levesque - massey variable .",
    "its extreme physical properties and position on the h - r diagram are similar to those observed in levesque - massey variables . however , there is currently no evidence for spectral variability based on past observations ; spectra obtained by elias et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , van loon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and this work all show woh g64 remaining in a consistent , cool , late - m - type state .",
    "the disagreement in type between m5 and m7 - 8 is almost certainly a result of differing methods rather than changes in the spectrum .",
    "however , more frequent observations of woh g64 could well uncover variations in its @xmath7 magnitude and t@xmath6 ; data from the all sky automated survey ( asas ) project ( pojmanski 2002 ) demonstrates that the star s",
    "@xmath78 magnitude shows considerable variability , but there is no @xmath7 or @xmath31 band data available . on the other hand",
    ", the star s very high reddening , well - defined dusty torus , and considerable maser activity would be unique among the levesque - massey variables ; these properties suggest woh g64 s similarity to the milky way s vy cma , as well as other dust - enshrouded rsgs with maser activity such as nml cyg , vx sgr , and s per ( schuster et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "finally , we detect a number of emission lines in the woh g64 optical spectrum , including h@xmath11 and h@xmath67 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] .",
    "the radial velocity of these features , 344 @xmath0 9 km s@xmath4 , is considerably greater than the star s radial velocity , 294 @xmath0 2 km s@xmath4 , which may be due to scattering by the expanding dust region .",
    "we also note the presence of some tio band heads in emission .",
    "this has been previously seen in the spectrum of vy cma , which is due to the extreme circumstellar environment .",
    "inspection of our data shows that the emission is not spatially extended , and the strength of the [ ] feature suggests that the dominant source of ionization for these features is shock heating .",
    "we can not reject the possibility that woh g64 is a binary system , with the nebular component contributed by a hot companion , but we do not favor this interpretation . first is the issue of the nebular radial velocities .",
    "we find a significant ( 50 km s@xmath4 ) velocity difference between the nebular emission and the stellar component , and , at first blush , this might be taken as an indication of binarity ; i.e. , with the nebula emission ( somehow ) tracking the motion of the hot component .",
    "however , a similar velocity was also noted by elias et al .",
    "while this could be a coincidence , it certainly does nt argue in favor of a binary hyptothesis . besides , in a short - period system we would not expect the ionized gas to be  attached \" to the hot star .",
    "rather , we prefer the explanation that the nebular redshift is the result of scattering within the expanding dust shell",
    ". we do note that if the putative hot companion shared the extinction measured from the nebular lines , rather than that of the rsg , its flux would dominate even in the red part of the spectrum , which is clearly not the case .",
    "if instead the companion shared the same high extinction as the rsg , but its hii region did not , we would still expect that the companion would dominate the flux in the blue part of the spectrum",
    ". a better spectrum going further into the blue should be able to substantiate or refute the possibility that a hot companion is present with the same extinction , as a late o - type dwarf would have a bolometric luminosity of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "accounting for the bolometric corrections involved would lead to @xmath81 for the companion , and @xmath82 for the rsg .",
    "thus , at @xmath83 , the two stars would be equally bright , as @xmath84 for a late - type o star , while @xmath85 for a rsg ( see massey 1998a , 1998b , and paper i ) .",
    "however , further investigation into the source of these emission lines will likely require further spectral analyses , as well as observations of woh g64 in the bluer regions of the spectrum .",
