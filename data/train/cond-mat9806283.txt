    "a two - dimensional system of non - interacting quasiparticles is considered in a periodic potential with a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the periodic potential can be understood as a pinned charge density wave , formed in a two - dimensional low - density electron gas due to coulomb interaction .",
    "this model is related to a possible formation of a wigner crystal in a two - dimensional electron gas with a perpendicular magnetic field , a problem which has attracted considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "another possible realization of the model is a system of quasiparticles in a layered type ",
    "ii superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field , where a periodic structure due to the vortex lattice in the abrikosov phase arises . due to impurities ,",
    "the periodicity of the potential is not perfect in a real system , and we have to incorporate weak random fluctuations of the potential .",
    "therefore , the total potential is a superposition of the periodic potential and weak randomness , creating a nearly periodic potential .",
    "we start with a continuum model which we map to the network model , following the ideas of chalker and coddington @xcite for the quantum hall system .",
    "the resulting model is defined by an evolution operator for the quasiparticles on a two - dimensional lattice , where the latter is an approximation of the nearly periodic potential .",
    "two types of scatterings are possible .",
    "one describes the scattering along the equipotential lines , while the other corresponds to the scattering through the saddle points of the potential .",
    "this model undergoes a transition between hall plateaux of the integer quantum hall effect , the quantum hall transition ( qht ) , when the scattering through the saddle points exceeds a critical value .",
    "the network model has been very successful as a starting point for numerical studies of the qht @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the model is not easily accessible to analytic methods due to its internal lattice structure .",
    "however , a large scale approximation , for weak disorder , sufficient for the investigation of transport properties , has been applied to the network model by ho and chalker @xcite .",
    "they found that the network model is equivalent to a model of dirac fermions .",
    "this result indicates that the network model is similar to the tight - binding model with half flux quantum per plaquette , where the large scale approximation also leads to dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding randomness in the resulting dirac fermions is different : the tight - binding model with random potential leads to dirac fermions with a random mass whereas the network model of the nearly periodic potential leads to dirac fermions with a random vector potential and a random energy .",
    "dirac fermions with randomness can be treated by field theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "a particular case is the purely random vector potential , which can be solved exactly by bosonization @xcite .",

    "we consider the dynamics of a particle with charge @xmath3 in the potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents a weakly fluctuating disorder potential .",
    "we start with a discussion of the classical motion , taking into account the lorentz force created by the perpendicular field @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coordinate vector . for a sufficiently small mass @xmath9",
    "the first term can be neglected , and the resulting first order differential equations show that the particle follows the equipotential lines of the potential : @xmath10 the approximation by the first order differential equation is equivalent with neglecting the cyclotron motion of the particle and reducing the dynamics to the motion of the guiding center . for @xmath11 a particle with energy",
    "@xmath12 follows closed counterclockwise orbits around a hill ( @xmath13 ) or clockwise orbits around a well ( @xmath14 ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) . only a particle with energy @xmath15 can travel through the whole two - dimensional space because there are extended equipotential lines at @xmath16 or at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the behavior near @xmath15 can be quantized using a lattice approximation .",
    "this approximation is based on the orbits of quasiparticles at a given energy @xmath19 which form a network of loops .",
    "quantum effects are described by tunneling between these loops in regions where the loops are close to each other , i.e. at the saddle points of the potential . for @xmath14",
    "the tunneling occurs between the loops in fig .",

    "for @xmath13 we have a complementary situation in which the preferred loops appear with the opposite current direction .",
    "apart from this difference , the subsequent analysis can be applied to this case as well .",
    "we will consider @xmath14 in the following .",
    "the tunneling can be expressed by discretized scattering processes of effective quasiparticle positions on the centers of the loop edges , enumerated by @xmath22 in fig .",

    "@xmath29 this state can be scattered along the loop , or can tunnel through one of the four saddle points to the loops at @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the component @xmath30 can be scattered either to @xmath31 with rate @xmath32 , obtaining a phase @xmath33 , or can tunnel to @xmath34 with rate @xmath35 , obtaining a phase @xmath36 .",
    "all possible processes can be combined as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , for example , are lattice shift operators in the positive ( negative ) @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) direction .",
    "the phases @xmath43 , ... , @xmath36 are associated with the centers of the loop edges .",
    "the weak random potential @xmath44 induces weakly fluctuating phases with @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this choice ensures the presence of half a flux quantum per current loop on average .",
    "( notice that the original network model @xcite has strong disorder due to a uniform distribution of the phases @xmath48 on the interval @xmath49 .",
    "it is not clear if our model with weak disorder belongs to the same universality class . since strong fluctuations of",
    "the phase correspond to strong fluctuations of the external magnetic field , the fact that a random magnetic field is a relevant perturbation @xcite indicates that both models may be qualitatively different . )",
    "the random potential @xmath44 also affects the tunneling between the loops .",
    "this induces randomness in the lattice shift operators @xmath50 .",
    "the latter are statistically independent for different nearest neighbor pairs on the lattice .",
    "we believe that @xmath51 is not realistic for the physical model because this describes a situation where the quasiparticles prefer to tunnel through the saddle points rather than go along the equipotential lines",
    ".    the ( discrete ) time evolution of the quasiparticle state on a loop can also be described by the evolution operator @xmath52 as @xmath53 @xcite , with @xmath54 assuming ( discrete ) translational invariance ( i.e. @xmath55 in the original model ) , we can diagonalize the scattering matrix by applying a fourier transformation @xmath56 . thus we find the eigenvalues of @xmath52 , @xmath57 the corresponding dispersion relation , @xmath58 , obtained via @xmath59 , has a gap around @xmath15 depending on @xmath23 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the gap vanishes at @xmath60 for @xmath61 , i.e. for @xmath62 .",
    "thus the quantum model reflects the behavior of the classical model , where infinite equipotential lines exist only at zero energy .",
    "the effect of disorder on this behavior will be studied subsequently .",
    "we briefly discuss an alternative lattice approximation of the almost periodic potential .",
    "it is based on the tight - binding representation of the continuous model . for this purpose",
    "we regard the minima , @xmath63 , and the maxima , @xmath64 , of the periodic potential as a lattice .",
    "quasiparticles can hop between neighboring lattice points with hopping rate @xmath27 , i.e. for hopping between a maximum and a minimum .",
    "moreover , it is reasonable to take the hopping between next - nearest neighbors into account also which are either pairs of maxima or pairs of minima , and associate a hopping rate @xmath65 with this process .",
    "the magnetic field leads again to a peierls phase factor in each of the hopping terms @xcite .",
    "disorder can be introduced by adding random fluctuations @xmath44 to the lattice points .",
    "this lattice approximation differs from the above network model because there are two types of hopping now .",
    "the nearest neighbor hopping between a maximum and a minimum has been excluded in the network approximation , since tunneling is considered only between states at the same energy .",

    "however , these correlations do not play a role here because the green s function is block - diagonal with respect to @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we emphasize that a non - compact continuous symmetry exists in the case @xmath98 ( pure random vector potential ) and @xmath99 , namely @xmath100h_{mn }   [ ( 1+\\zeta^2)^{1/2}\\sigma_0+\\zeta\\sigma_3 ]   \\label{csymm}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath76 , with @xmath101 .",
    "this symmetry indicates that the pure random vector potential is qualitativly different from the general case with @xmath102 , e.g. the symmetry is reduced to a discrete one with @xmath103 for averages of physical quantities if @xmath104 .",
    "the time evolution of the quasiparticles in the network is given by iterating the time step operator @xmath52 .",

    "this behavior of the transport quantity @xmath2 is unphysical , and will be replaced by a continuous behavior when we take disorder into account : then the dos is found to vanish at @xmath15 for all @xmath118 , which indicates that the hall current flows on the boundary .",
