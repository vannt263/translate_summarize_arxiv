    "spin systems coupled to fluctuating manifolds are studied as a simple example for matter fields coupled to euclidean quantum gravity . to describe the gravity sector we used the discrete regge model  @xcite which is both structurally and computationally much simpler than the standard regge calculus with continuous link lengths . here",
    "numerical simulations can be done more efficiently by implementing look - up tables and using the heat - bath algorithm . in the actual computations we took the squared link lengths as @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "because a four - dimensional regge skeleton with equilateral simplices can not be embedded in flat space , @xmath4 takes different values depending on the type of the edge @xmath5 .",
    "in particular @xmath6 for edges , face diagonals , body diagonals , and the hyperbody diagonal of a hypercube .",
    "we investigated the partition function @xmath7 \\exp[-i(q ) - k e(q , s)],\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the gravitational action , @xmath9 the first sum runs over all products of triangle areas @xmath10 times corresponding deficit angles @xmath11 weighted by the gravitational coupling @xmath12 .",
    "the second sum extends over the volumes @xmath13 of the 4-simplices of the lattice and allows together with the cosmological constant @xmath14 to set an overall scale in the action .",
    "the energy of ising spins @xmath15 , @xmath16 is defined as in two dimensions  @xcite , with the barycentric area @xmath17 associated with a link @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we chose the simple uniform measure as in the pure gravity simulations  @xcite , @xmath20=\\prod_l dq_l { \\cal f}(q_l)$ ] .",
    "the function @xmath21 ensures that only euclidean link configurations are taken into account . for every monte carlo",
    "simulation run we recorded the time series of the energy density @xmath22 and the magnetization density @xmath23 , with the lattice size @xmath24 . to obtain results for the various observables @xmath25 at values of the spin coupling @xmath26 in an interval around the simulation point @xmath27 , we applied standard reweighting techniques  @xcite . with the help of the time series",
    "we compute the specific heat , @xmath28 , the ( finite lattice ) susceptibility , @xmath29 , the binder parameter , @xmath30 , and various derivatives of the magnetization , @xmath31 , @xmath32ln@xmath33 , and @xmath32ln@xmath34 .",
    "all these quantities exhibit in the infinite - volume limit singularities at @xmath35 which are shifted and rounded in finite systems .",
    "in four dimensions it is generally accepted that the critical properties of the ising model on a static lattice are given by mean - field theory , with logarithmic corrections .",
    "the finite - size formulas can be written as  @xcite @xmath36 where the critical exponents of mean - field theory are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the gravitational degrees of freedom of the partition function ( [ z ] ) were updated with the heat - bath algorithm . for the ising spins we employed the single - cluster algorithm  @xcite . between measurements we performed @xmath41",
    "monte carlo steps consisting of one lattice sweep to update the squared link lengths  @xmath42 followed by two single - cluster flips to update the spins  @xmath43 .",
    "the simulations were done for cosmological constant @xmath44 and gravitational coupling @xmath45 .",
    "this @xmath12-value corresponds to a phase transition of the pure discrete regge model  @xcite .",
    "the lattice topology is given by triangulated tori of size @xmath24 with @xmath46 up to 10 . from short test",
    "runs we estimated the location of the phase transition of the spin model and set the spin coupling @xmath47 in the long runs . after an initial equilibration time we took about @xmath48 measurements for each lattice size . analyzing the time series we found integrated autocorrelation times for the energy and the magnetization in the range of unity for all lattice sizes .",
    "the statistical errors were obtained by the standard jack - knife method using 50 blocks .    applying the reweighting technique we first determined the maxima of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath32ln@xmath52 , and @xmath32ln@xmath34 .",
    "the locations of the maxima provide us with five sequences of pseudo - transition points @xmath53 for which the scaling variable @xmath54 should be constant . using this fact we then have several possibilities to extract the critical exponent @xmath55 from ( linear ) least - square fits of the fss ansatz with logarithmic corrections  ( [ eq : kc2 ] ) , @xmath56 to the data at the various @xmath53 sequences .",
    "we also performed fits of a naive power - law fss ansatz .",
    "the exponents @xmath57 resulting from fits using the data @xmath58 are collected in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "@xmath59 denotes the standard goodness - of - fit parameter . for our simulations all exponent estimates with the logarithmic corrections and",
    "consequently also their weighted average @xmath60 are in agreement with the mean - field value @xmath61 . with the naive power - law ansatz one",
    "also gets an estimate for @xmath57 close to the mean - field value , but clearly separated from it .    ",

    "the combined estimate from the five sequences leads to @xmath71 .    knowing the critical coupling we may reconfirm our estimates of @xmath57 by evaluating the above quantities at @xmath35 .",
    "as can be inspected in table  [ tab:1 ] , the statistical errors of the fss fits at @xmath35 are similar to those using the @xmath69 sequences",
    ". however , here we have to take into account the uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath35 .",
    "this error is computed by repeating the fits at @xmath72 and indicated in table  [ tab:1 ] by the numbers in square brackets . in the computation of the weighted average",
    "we assume the two types of errors to be independent . as a result of this combined analysis",
    "we obtain strong evidence that the exponent @xmath55 agrees with the mean - field value of @xmath40 .    to extract the critical exponent ratio @xmath73 we use the scaling  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) of the susceptibility @xmath50 at its maximum as well as at @xmath35 , yielding in the range @xmath74 estimates of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 $ ] ( @xmath78 ) , respectively .",
    "these estimates for @xmath73 are consistent with the mean - field value of @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_sus4diz2 ] this is demonstrated graphically by comparing the scaling of @xmath80 with a constrained one - parameter fit of the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",

    "we have performed a study of the ising model coupled to fluctuating manifolds via regge calculus . analyzing the discrete regge model with two permissible edge lengths",
    "it turns out that the ising transition shows the expected logarithmic corrections to the mean - field theory .",
    "we have also studied the pure ising model on a rigid lattice without presenting the results in this short note .",
    "the critical exponents of the phase transition of the ising spins on a static lattice as well as on a discrete regge skeleton are both consistent with the exponents of mean - field theory , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . in summary , from our comparative analysis with uniform computer codes we conclude that the phase transition of the ising spin model coupled to a discrete regge skeleton exhibits the same critical exponents and the same logarithmic corrections as on a static lattice",
