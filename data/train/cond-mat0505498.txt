    "in the past few years , there has been a large volume of literature regarding the applications of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) in the presence of the so - called _ nonlinearity management _",
    "( often referred to also as feshbach resonance management ) .",
    "the nls is a prototypical dispersive nonlinear wave equation of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex envelope field , @xmath2 is an external potential , @xmath3 is a time - periodic nonlinearity coefficient , and @xmath4 is the laplacian operator with @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "nonlinearity management arises in applications in optics for transverse beam propagation in layered optical media @xcite , as well as in atomic physics for the feshbach resonance of the scattering length of inter - atomic interactions in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the periodic variation of @xmath3 through an external magnetic field has been used as a means of producing robust matter - wave breathers in quasi - one - dimensional becs @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the nonlinearity management may prevent collapse - type phenomena in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the nonlinearity management were performed with a reduction of the time - periodic pde problem ( [ eqn1 ] ) to a time - periodic ode problem using a variational method @xcite and a moment method @xcite .",
    "the physical relevance of the time - periodic nls equation , as evidenced by the above works , led to further developments in analysis of the pde problem ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "as an example , the success of the averaging theory @xcite for optical solitons in the presence of _ strong dispersion management _ , led to an analogous development for _ strong nonlinearity management _ produced originally in @xcite and systematized in @xcite .",
    "the time - periodic nls equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) is averaged in the limit @xmath7 , where @xmath8 measures a short period and the large variation of @xmath3 in the decomposition @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 has a unit period and zero mean .",
    "after the averaging procedure , the time - periodic pde problem ( [ eqn1 ] ) is governed by the averaged nls equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the mean - zero anti - derivative of @xmath10 .",
    "derivation and local well - posedness of solutions of the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) in function space @xmath15 are reviewed for @xmath16 in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider global well - posedness of solutions of the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) in the energy space @xmath17 for @xmath6 .",
    "the use of @xmath18 and @xmath6 seems more appropriate for physical applications of the averaged model ( [ eqn0 ] ) . in particular",
    ", we address the question whether the averaged nls equation with a nonlinearity management @xmath19 arrests the blowup of solutions of the nls equation in two and three dimensions that would occur if no nonlinearity management was applied @xmath20 ) .",
    "we show that the averaged nls equation is globally well - posed and no blowup of solutions occurs for @xmath21 .",
    "this is demonstrated initially , in section 2 , from the point of view of scaling arguments .",
    "the statement is subsequently proved using rigorous estimates in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we compare the above conclusion and earlier works where possibilities of blowup of solutions of the full time - periodic nls equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) have been reported .",
    "section 5 summarizes our findings .",
    "the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) has a standard hamiltonian form ( see @xcite ) with the hamiltonian functional : @xmath22 due to the gauge invariance , the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) also conserves the squared @xmath23 norm : @xmath24 solitary wave solutions of the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) are critical points of @xmath25 at the level set of fixed values of @xmath26 .    using formal scaling arguments @xcite",
    "( see also the review of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we consider a two - parameter family of dilatations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are parameters and @xmath29 is a suitable function of @xmath30 .",
    "the squared @xmath23 norm ( [ eqn2a ] ) is preserved by the dilatations ( [ eqn4a ] ) whenever @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn2 ] ) at the dilatations ( [ eqn4a ] ) is scaled as a function of parameter @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 let us consider the case of no nonlinearity management and no external potential , when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eqn4 ] ) that the hamiltonian function @xmath37 is positive definite in the defocusing case , when @xmath38 . in the focusing case , when @xmath39 , the hamiltonian function @xmath37 is bounded from below for @xmath16 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and is unbounded from below for @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 when @xmath37 is unbounded from below as @xmath45 , the critical points of @xmath25 at a fixed value of @xmath26 ( i.e. , solitary wave solutions ) can not be stable for small width @xmath46 and instability of solitary waves implies a blowup of localized initial data in the time evolution of the cubic nls equation ( see @xcite for details ) .    when the nonlinearity management is applied , the last term in the decomposition ( [ eqn4 ] ) always dominates and it preserves the boundness of @xmath37 from below for any @xmath47 .",
    "this indicates on the level of formal scaling arguments that the blowup of solutions is arrested by the nonlinearity management term in the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) .",
    "we shall prove this conjecture with rigorous analysis of well - posedness of solutions .",
    "we also note that the first term in the decomposition ( [ eqn4 ] ) does not change the conclusions above if @xmath48 is a smooth non - negative potential , such that @xmath49 . typical examples of @xmath48 are parabolic magnetic traps , when @xmath50 , and periodic optical lattices , when @xmath51 .",
    "the rigorous analysis of the local well - posedness of the averaged nls equation is not a trivial task .",
    "in fact , to the best of our knowledge , one can not verify even the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to this problem .",
    "the problem has been considered in one dimension @xmath16 by poppenberg where a local well - posedness result with data in @xmath52 was established @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    "@xmath53 , one needs to require that the initial data be in @xmath54 for sufficiently large @xmath55,@xmath56 , that is @xmath57 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , one needs to assume a `` non - trapping '' condition on the symbol of the second order operator .",
    "this is a geometric condition , which depends on the profile of the initial data ( see @xcite for details ) .    to summarize",
    ", we can not state a precise condition under which the averaged nls equation has a ( local ) solution that preserves values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 constant in time .",
    "we will however show , that whenever such a local solution exists for a short time @xmath60 , it can be extended globally for all @xmath61 .    to that end",
    ", we represent the hamiltonian @xmath25 in the form : @xmath62 where @xmath63 we consider the focusing case @xmath39 and prove that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are bounded by the two conserved quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "first , we quote a variant of the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality ( see ( 1.1.16 ) on p. 15 in @xcite ) .    for all @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , it is true for every function @xmath69 on @xmath70 that @xmath71    next , we define and use the fourier transform and its inverse for a function @xmath69 on @xmath70 : @xmath72 the plancherel s formula gives @xmath73 and the inequality @xmath74 is immediate from the definition .",
    "let @xmath75 be a @xmath76 function with a compact support on @xmath77 $ ] , such that @xmath78 on @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath80 be a @xmath81 function , such that @xmath82 .",
    "the ( smooth ) fourier multiplier @xmath83 is defined for every positive @xmath84 by @xmath85 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath86 let @xmath87 .",
    "then both @xmath88 are self - adjoint , bounded on @xmath23 operators .",
    "the following statement is a modification of the sobolev embedding theorem .",
    "[ le:1 ] there exists a constant @xmath89 , which depends only on the dimension @xmath6 , so that it is true for every function @xmath69 on @xmath70 that @xmath90    since @xmath91 , it will suffice to show that @xmath92 the bound follows simply by the plancherel s theorem and @xmath93 .",
    "indeed , @xmath94 by duality , the bound follows from the estimate @xmath95 . that is trivial as well , since",
    "@xmath96 the positive constant @xmath97 can be taken to be the square root of the volume of the ball in @xmath98 with radius @xmath99 .",
    "the central result of our analysis is the following theorem .",
    "[ theo:1 ] there exist @xmath100 and @xmath101 , so that for every @xmath102 , it is true for every function @xmath103 on @xmath70 that @xmath104    let @xmath105 with @xmath106 in and obtain @xmath107 next , we set @xmath108 and obtain @xmath109 for some positive constant @xmath110 .",
    "we have used here that @xmath111 by the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality ( [ gn ] ) , we have @xmath112 , such that the last inequality is rewritten in the form : @xmath113 where in the last line we have used the cauchy - schwartz inequality : @xmath114 let @xmath115 , where @xmath116 .",
    "then , the term @xmath117 can be estimated from the bound as follows : @xmath118 for some constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 . by the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality ( [ gn ] )",
    ", we have @xmath121 , such that the upper bound for @xmath122 follows from ( [ cs ] ) and : @xmath123 which is the desired upper bound .    as a corollary of the main theorem , we pick @xmath124 and immediately obtain the following upper bounds .",
    "there exists constants @xmath125 and @xmath126 that depend on @xmath127,@xmath128,@xmath129 , so that @xmath130 and @xmath131    since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are conserved in the time evolution , the cauchy problem for the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) has global solutions in the energy space @xmath17 , if the initial data @xmath132 gives rise to local solutions in the same energy space .",
    "therefore , the blowup of solutions of the nls equation with @xmath35 in @xmath53 is arrested by the nonlinearity management for any @xmath47 .",
    "we have proven that the blowup does not occur in the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) in higher dimensions @xmath53 for @xmath21 .",
    "this result raises the question whether the blowup of solutions is arrested in the full nls equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) for any non - zero variance of the time - periodic nonlinearity coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "we address this question within the ode reduction of the time - periodic problem , which was considered recently with a variational method @xcite and a moment method @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the time evolution of the radially symmetric localized solutions of the full nls equaiton ( [ eqn1 ] ) is approximated by a time - dependent , generalized ermakov - pinney @xcite equation : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is an effective width of a localized solution , while @xmath135 are constants found from an initial data , such that @xmath136 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we shall consider the critical case @xmath40 and rewrite the ode ( [ eqn5 ] ) with the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath3 in ( [ eqn2aa ] ) in the explicit form : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 is a mean - zero @xmath8-periodic function of @xmath141 .",
    "conditions for blowup and existence of bounded oscillations in solutions of the ode ( [ eqn5a ] ) were recently reviewed in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "the sufficient condition for the blowup ( when @xmath142 in a finite time @xmath143 ) is @xmath144 the sufficient condition for the unbounded growth of the solution width ( when @xmath145 as @xmath146 ) is @xmath147 the necessary condition for the bounded oscillations of @xmath148 for any @xmath149 is @xmath150 numerical simulations in @xcite showed that the condition ( [ suf-2 ] ) was also sufficient in the case @xmath151 for the blowup arrest for any @xmath149 .",
    "it is obvious from the explicit scaling that @xmath152 in the asymptotic limit @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the second condition ( [ suf-2 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath151 and solutions of the time - periodic ode ( [ eqn5a ] ) do not collapse , in agreement with our results derived for the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) .",
    "previous work @xcite ( see also the review in @xcite ) has also addressed the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) in the limit of _ weak _ nonlinearity management , when @xmath10 is rescaled as @xmath153 and the parameter @xmath154 is small in the limit @xmath7 as @xmath155 .",
    "solutions of the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) at the leading order @xmath156 blow up in a finite time , but the small @xmath157-terms formally stabilize the blow - up for any @xmath158 .",
    "although this approximation of the critical nls equation has been considered in many applications of nonlinear optics ( see sections 4 - 5 in @xcite and references therein ) , it is clearly insufficient for a correct identification of the domain , where the blowup of solutions occurs . indeed , while the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) with small @xmath154 predicts no blowup of solutions , it is clear that the weak nonlinearity management corresponds to the case @xmath159 ) ) collapse in the domain ( [ suf-1 ] ) .",
    "following the work @xcite , we address the failure of the averaging procedure for weak nonlinearity management in a simple time - periodic ode problem : @xmath160 where @xmath151 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are order of @xmath163 in the limit @xmath7 . by using the formal asymptotic multi - scale expansion method ( see @xcite for details ) , we construct an asymptotic solution to the problem ( [ eqn5b ] ) : @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are recursively found from the set of linear inhomogeneous problems , @xmath167 the mean - value term @xmath168 satisfies an extended dynamical equation that excludes secular growth of the correction terms of the series ( [ series ] ) in @xmath169 : @xmath170 the averaged ode problem ( [ ode ] ) is an equation of motion for an effective particle with a coordinate @xmath168 in the potential field with an effective potential energy : @xmath171 when @xmath151 and @xmath172 , the particle with @xmath173 reaches @xmath174 at a finite time @xmath175 , that indicates the blowup of a localized solution . when the next @xmath176-term is taken into account ( as in the approximation of weak nonlinearity management @xcite ) , the blow - up is arrested and the mean - value term @xmath168 oscillates in an effective minimum of the potential energy @xmath177 , truncated at @xmath176-terms . when the next @xmath178-term is taken into account ( beyond the approximation of weak nonlinearity management ) , the potential energy @xmath177 with @xmath151 does not prevent the blowup of the localized solution depending on the initial data @xmath179 .",
    "existence versus non - existence of blowup depends on the ratio of parameters @xmath162 but the difference can only be detected in the averaging method if convergence of the power series ( [ potential ] ) is established in a closed analytical form .",
    "similarly , the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) can not be used in the limit of weak nonlinearity management for an accurate prediction of existence versus non - existence of blowup of solutions . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the full nls equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) in @xmath40 with @xmath180    we have observed that collapse of localized initial data does occur ( see solid curve on fig .",
    "[ qfig1 ] ) by monitoring the half - width ( of one dimensional slices along @xmath181 ) of the wavefunction ( for radially symmetric gaussian initial data ) , @xmath182 ) with the same parameters show that the half - width @xmath55 never decreased below @xmath183 ( see dashed curve on fig .",
    "[ qfig1 ] ) indicating the absence of collapse in accordance with the rigorous results presented above .",
    "therefore , the averaged nls equation ( [ eqn0 ] ) can only be used for modeling of the blowup arrest in the limit of strong nonlinearity management of the full nls equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) when @xmath184 and @xmath8 is small .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the global well - posedness of solutions of the averaged nls equation that describe strong nonlinearity management of the time - periodic nls equation .",
    "we have showed with formal scaling arguments and rigorous analysis that the blowup of solutions in higher dimensions is arrested within the averaged nls equation .",
    "we have also discussed the non - applicability of the averaged nls equation to the weak nonlinearity management , where the blowup of solutions can occur beyond the weak management limit .",
    "it is an open problem to study well - posedness of the full time - periodic nls equation , depending on parameters of the nonlinearity management and profile of initial data .",
    "rigorous results on the latter problem are only available within the ode approximation ( [ eqn5 ] ) , when the pde model is reduced to a dynamical system with one degree of freedom .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to study mathematically and to examine numerically whether the theoretical prediction from the method of moments provides an optimal bound for the full pde model with arbitrary initial data .",
