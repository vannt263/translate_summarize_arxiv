    "quantum dots ( qd ) are one kind of nano - device in which the motion of electrons is quantized in all three dimensions through the lateral confinement of a high - mobility modulation - doped two - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor hetero - structure.@xcite both quantum interference and electron - electron interactions play important roles , and their interplay underlies many properties that are fascinating in terms of both fundamental mesoscopic physics and future technical applications .",
    "various theoretical models have been developed to explain experimental discoveries and to predict new properties .",
    "the kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) method @xcite provides an accurate numerical model to study electron - electron interaction effects in qd systems .",
    "@xcite in spite of its comparatively low computational cost , previous dft calculations are limited to systems in which the electron number is generally less than a few tens . in many experimental cases ,",
    "however , the electron numbers involved are more than several hundred .",
    "the main theoretical approaches in the regime of large number of electrons are statistical methods @xcite which are usually based on some general assumptions whose validity , in many cases , is yet to be justified .",
    "it is therefore desirable to explore the large dot regime directly by using numerically more accurate models such as dft .",
    "this imposes a demanding computational task because to obtain meaningful statistics , many calculations with several hundred electrons need to be done .",
    "it is therefore compelling to develop more efficient numerical techniques for dft simulation of qd systems ; this is the main object of the current study .",
    "two key issues are involved in the numerical implementation of the ks - dft method:@xcite ( 1 ) the numerical representation of wave functions and the ks hamiltonian , and ( 2 ) the solution of the numerical ks equation . while local basis sets ( mainly gaussian - type orbitals ) dominate in conventional quantum chemistry of molecular systems , the plane wave ( pw ) basis,@xcite combined with the pseudo - potential method , is widely used in the _ ab initio _ electronic calculations of various material systems , in which the fast - fourier transform ( fft ) method can be used to take full advantage of the periodicity of crystal structures . in principle , the pw method is valid only for periodic systems , but aperiodic systems can be treated by introducing the super - cell technique.@xcite in recent years , several groups have been advocating the use of basis - free real space methods for electronic structure calculations of finite systems , in which the wave functions are represented in real space , and the kinetic energy operator is discretized by a high - order finite difference ( fd ) method .",
    "@xcite with a given representation , there are various methods to solve the resultant numerical ks equation .",
    "roughly they fall into two different types : methods that minimize the total energy directly , and those that solve the ks equation in a self - consistent way .",
    "in addition , for dft simulations of finite systems , another important issue is the calculation of the hartree potential .",
    "aiming at modelling qd systems efficiently , we have developed new techniques in both the numerical representation of ks orbitals and the solution of the ks equation .",
    "we note that in qd systems , the wave functions vanish at the boundaries , and in some cases even the hard - wall boundary condition is used . for a function in a rectangular box with zero boundary values , the most natural basis set is the particle - in - the - box ( pib ) basis set .",
    "the kinetic energy operator is diagonal in the pib space and the transformation between real and pib space can be efficiently performed by the fast sine - transform ( fst ) method , which is a variant of the fft .",
    "for the solution of the ks equation , we modified teter , payne and allan ( tpa ) s band - by - band conjugate gradient method @xcite to get a more efficient direct minimization approach .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section , after a simple description of the ks - dft method , we present the main components of our algorithm : ( 1 ) the pib representation of the ks equation ; ( 2 ) a modified band - by - band conjugate gradient method for the direct minimization of the ks total energy ; ( 3 ) a fourier convolution method for the calculation of the hartree potential that was developed by martyna and tuckerman @xcite in the pw pseudo - potential calculations ; and ( 4 ) a simplified multi - grid technique to accelerate the convergence . in section iii , the new algorithm is tested in a 2d model qd system with electron number @xmath0 .",
    "section iv summarizes the main results and concludes the paper .",
    "considering the important role played by electron spin in qd systems , we take the effect of spin polarization explicitly into account in the framework of kohn - sham spin - density functional theory ( ks - sdft ) .",

    "one of the key ingredients in our algorithm is the action of the single - particle hamiltonian operator on wave functions , @xmath36 the efficiency of which is critical for the performance of the whole algorithm . whereas the potential energy operator is diagonal in real space , the kinetic energy operator is diagonal in pib space .",
    "wave functions can be transformed between the two spaces efficiently by the fast sine transform . in our algorithm ,",
    "wave functions are in discrete real space @xmath37 , and the application of the potential energy operator is therefore trivial , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the value of the potential at the point @xmath40 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator is applied to wave functions in pib space , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , which in the discrete form becomes @xmath43    the pib representation formulated above is closely related to the pw method .",
    "in fact , for finite systems with soft - wall boundaries , the two representations are numerically equivalent .",
    "mathematically , however , they are different : the pib basis set is real and the zero boundary condition is imposed by the basis set itself , but in the pw case the basis functions are complex and the wave functions are forced to be zero at the boundaries by the external potential of systems under study .",
    "the pw method will fail in the case of the hard - wall boundary problem , which is quite common in the studies of quantum dots , but the pib method is still valid .      in direct minimization approaches ,",
    "the ks total energy functional is minimized directly over orbital wave functions under orthonormal constraints .",
    "we have made several important modifications to tpa s band - by - band conjugate - gradient scheme to obtain higher efficiency .",
    "here we give an outline of the algorithm , and emphasize the modifications we have made .",
    "the basic idea of a band - by - band scheme is to minimize the total energy over one band ( or orbital ) at a time , which , compared to other conjugate - gradient schemes,@xcite has the following advantages : ( 1 ) much lower requirement for storage space , ( 2 ) simpler implementation , and ( 3 ) particularly in our algorithm , an efficient approximate line - minimization scheme , as will be shown .",
    "first the steepest descent ( sd ) vector for the @xmath44-th orbital at the @xmath45-th iteration is calculated from @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( to simplify the notation , we use dirac s state vector notation and drop the spin index in the following formulation ) . in tpa",
    "s algorithm , the sd vector is preconditioned before it is used to build the conjugate vector . in our calculations , however , it was found that although in many cases preconditioning does accelerate the convergence , its effect is not always positive . on the other hand",
    ", the computational overhead in the preconditioning step , which involves another orthogonalization process as well as the action of the preconditioning operator on the sd vector , can be expensive for large systems .",
    "as shown later , by using a simplified multi - grid technique , we can achieve fast convergence even without preconditioning of the sd vectors .",
    "the conjugate vector @xmath48 is then constructed as a linear combination of the sd vector @xmath49 and the previous conjugate vector , @xmath50 where @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the conjugate vector is further orthogonalized to the present band @xmath53 and normalized ( @xmath54 is denoted as the normalization operator ) , @xmath55 the new wave function for the @xmath44-th orbital @xmath56 is formed from the linear combination @xmath57 which is guaranteed to remain normalized and orthogonal to all other orbitals .",
    "@xmath58 is obtained by minimizing the total energy as a function of @xmath59 with @xmath60 . in tpa",
    "s algorithm , @xcite @xmath58 is determined by the following approximate scheme : the total energy as a function of @xmath61 is approximated by @xmath62 ; the three unknowns , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are determined according to three pieces of information : @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "here we propose a more efficient approximate scheme for the determination of @xmath58 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath69 with respect to @xmath61 can be obtained from @xmath70 assuming @xmath71 , from @xmath72 we get @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 the underlying approximation in our scheme is similar to that of tpa s , but our scheme is much more efficient in terms of computational effort : in tpa s scheme , at each band iteration the total energy must be calculated twice , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath68 ; in our scheme , the most time - consuming step is the action of @xmath76 on @xmath77 , which is much faster than the calculation of the total energy .",
    "considering further the fact that the total number of band iterations can be very large , we note that an efficient line - minimization scheme such as ours is crucial to reduce the computational effort .    in tpa s",
    "algorithm , after the wave - function is updated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : update ] ) , the kohn - sham hamiltonian is updated immediately , which involves the reconstruction of @xmath78 and @xmath79 according to the new density .",
    "this is actually quite expensive for large systems . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that the ks hamiltonian will not experience large changes inside the iterations of a single orbital .",
    "so in our algorithm , we update @xmath80 after every @xmath81 band iterations , and the optimal value of @xmath82 will be explored in the next section .    in each orbital ,",
    "the procedure described above is repeated @xmath83 times ; the iterations are then started on the next orbital .",
    "after the wave functions of all orbitals are updated in this way , the total energy is calculated and is compared to that of the previous cycle to determine if the final convergence is achieved .",
    "the main parameters in the algorithm are @xmath84 and @xmath82 .",
    "their effects on the performance of the algorithm will be tested in detail in the next section .      for finite systems , the simplest and perhaps most inefficient way to calculate",
    "@xmath24 is by direct numerical integration , which is feasible only for small systems .",
    "another widely - used approach is to solve the poisson equation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : vh ] ) .",
    "though the poisson equation itself can be solved with great efficiency , the calculation of boundary values can be quite expensive even by using efficient multipole expansion techniques .",
    "additionally , the poisson solver approach is valid only for 3d systems ; in the case of 2d systems , there is no poisson equation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : vh ] ) . in recent years , several schemes",
    "have been proposed to extend the conventional fourier convolution method to finite systems.@xcite in particular we have incorporated martyna and tuckerman s method@xcite into our algorithm .",
    "considering that the martyna - tuckerman method was developed mainly for the modelling of molecular and material systems within the plane - wave pseudo - potential framework , we will formulate the approach here with some detail .",
    "the calculation of the hartree potential is straightforward for periodic systems , but this is not the case for finite aperiodic systems .",
    "the potential @xmath86 has the form of the convolution between the density and the coulomb interaction kernel , @xmath87 , which has the following simple relation in the fourier space,@xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 refers to the fourier transform of @xmath90 .",
    "( [ eq : vh2 ] ) is useful only when we have the analytical form of @xmath91 and can perform the inverse fourier transform of @xmath92 analytically , which is not true for most cases where the density is usually represented in discrete real space .",
    "illustration of the fourier convolution method for the calculation of the hartree potential in finite systems .",
    "the original grid where the density and potential are defined is extended into doubled space .",
    "the density in the extended region is set to zero . imposing the periodic boundary condition for this extended grid",
    ", the unphysical interaction between neighboring super - cells can be avoided.,width=268 ]    when applying the fourier method to discrete finite systems , periodic boundary conditions are always assumed .",
    "it has long been known that the unphysical interactions between neighboring super - cells can be avoided by calculating @xmath24 in a doubly extended grid . @xcite in particular for 2d systems as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vh ] , the original @xmath93 grid ( @xmath94 ) is extended to @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the density in the extended grid is defined as @xmath97 imposing periodic boundary conditions to both the density and the coulomb interaction kernel in the extended grid , the potential can be calculated according to the convolution theorem , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are respectively finite fourier integrals of the density and the coulomb interaction kernel in the extended grid , @xmath101 where @xmath96 is used to denote both the extend grid and its volume ( or area in the 2d case ) .",
    "while @xmath99 can be easily obtained from the discrete fourier transform of its real space values by fft , the calculation of @xmath100 is much more involved because of the singularity of the coulomb interaction kernel in real space .",
    "the key to martyna - tuckerman s approach is to decompose the coulomb interaction kernel into long- and short - range parts , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the error function and its complement , respectively , and @xmath105 is the parameter that controls the effective cut - off range .",
    "the finite fourier integral of the short range part can be well approximated by its infinite fourier transform , @xmath106 which is analytically known in both 2d and 3d cases .",
    "the finite fourier integral of the long - range interaction can be directly obtained from the discrete fourier transform of its real space values . in the practical implementation",
    ", @xmath107 needs to be calculated only once at the beginning .",
    "the calculation of @xmath108 involves only two ffts ( one forward and one backward ) , which makes this approach much more efficient than methods based on a poisson solver .",
    "the multi - grid method is an efficient technique to accelerate the convergence in various real space relaxation approaches.@xcite the basic idea is that low - frequency errors are easier to eliminate in a coarse grid than in a fine grid .",
    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple one - way multi - grid technique in finite - difference real space ks calculations .",
    "wave functions being represented in real - space in our algorithm , a similar simplified multi - grid ( smg ) method can be implemented in a straightforward way : the ks energy functional is first minimized in a coarse grid ; the converged wave functions , after interpolation and re - orthogonalization , are taken as the initial guess for the minimization on the fine grid . with these well - preconditioned initial wave functions , the convergence in the fine grid can be easily attained .",
    "in most experimental qd systems , the excitation in the vertical direction can be neglected , and a 2d model is a good approximation . in this paper",
    "we will report test results only in a 2d system ; the extension to 3d systems is straightforward , and the high efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to explore large dots even in the 3d case .",
