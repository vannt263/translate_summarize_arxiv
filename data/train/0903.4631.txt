    "the maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory , @xmath0 , is an extremely special four dimensional field theory . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that the colour ordered one - loop scattering amplitudes are remarkably close to a universal form : @xmath4 where @xmath2 is helicity - independent and @xmath5 is a helicity - dependent correction .",
    "@xmath2 contains the exact @xmath6 and @xmath7 infrared singular terms .",
    "we find that the error is surprisingly small , being less than @xmath8 for the explicit six , seven and eight point amplitudes we study .",
    "the exact analytic forms of many one - loop amplitudes are known , however approximate universality is not manifest from an analytic study of these expressions .",
    "instead it is observed when we numerically evaluate these analytic forms . in the next section we review the known analytic forms of @xmath0 one - loop @xmath9-point amplitudes and in section 3",
    "we present a numerical study of these expressions for six and seven gluon amplitudes together with the nmhv eight - point amplitudes .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes for gluon scattering in @xmath0 super - yang  mills are particularly simple , being heavily constrained by the large symmetry .",
    "they can be expressed entirely in terms of scalar boxes  @xcite : @xmath10 the amplitude is completely defined by specifying the rational coefficients @xmath11 .",
    "this is a considerable simplification relative to a generic yang ",
    "mills amplitude which would contain scalar triangle functions , scalar bubble functions and additional rational pieces .",
    "the set of scalar box functions is @xmath12 with the labeling as indicated in figure  [ boxesfigure ] .",
    "+    such amplitudes are `` cut - constructible '' meaning they may be reconstructed using cutting rules with on - shell four dimensional tree amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 may be determined in various ways , originally via the two - particle cuts  @xcite , but perhaps most conveniently using `` quadruple cuts ''  @xcite .",
    "the quadruple cuts give the box - coefficients as a product of four tree amplitudes , @xmath13 the sum is over all allowed intermediate configurations and particle types  @xcite . using the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ boxexpansion ] ) together with the quadruple cuts makes the computation of one - loop amplitudes considerably more tractable than the corresponding qcd amplitudes .",
    "it is convenient to define rescaled box functions @xmath14 by @xmath15 the @xmath16 functions are the box functions with the appropriate momentum prefactors removed ; explicit formulae may be found in , for example , ref.@xcite",
    ". the momentum invariants are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "analytic results will be given in the four - dimensional helicity regularisation scheme ( fdh )  @xcite with the box integrals defined in @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "the amplitudes in other schemes such as t  hooft  veltman are simply related to those in fdh via @xmath20 which leads to a small modification of @xmath2 but leaves @xmath5 unchanged .    in any supersymmetric theory",
    "the gluon scattering amplitudes with all or all - but - one helicities of the same type vanish @xmath21 and the simplest non - vanishing amplitudes are the `` mhv '' ( maximally helicity - violating ) amplitudes which have exactly two negative helicity gluons . at tree level",
    "these amplitudes are given by the parke ",

    "we use the notation @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being a massless weyl spinor with momentum @xmath28 and chirality @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the spinor products are related to momentum invariants by @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the one - loop mhv amplitudes in @xmath0 have the form  @xcite : @xmath32 where the sum of @xmath33 functions is over all possible inequivalent functions with the appropriate cyclic ordering of legs .",
    "the form @xmath2 is universal in that it does not depend upon which two legs have negative helicity .",
    "the sum over box coefficients can be expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms via @xmath34 where all indices are understood to be mod @xmath9 and @xmath35 is the renormalisation scale .",

    "@xcite , with the generalisation to all-@xmath9 being given in ref .",
    "the detailed formulae are given in these references , however the pattern for the nmhv is one of increasing complexity .",
    "for example the seven - point amplitude is @xmath60 which is a sum over all possible seven - point box functions .",
    "the formulae for the 35 coefficients are given in two different forms in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . very few coefficients are absent .",

    "@xcite and used them to study the seven- and eight - point nmhv amplitudes numerically .",
    "in this section we present a numerical study of approximate universality in @xmath0 one - loop amplitudes .",
    "since four- and five - point amplitudes must be mhv ( or conjugate to mhv ) these amplitudes have an exact universality ; therefore we start our study with the six - point amplitudes .",
    "the functional forms of the different components of the six - point amplitudes are gathered together in  @xcite together with the implementation of most of these in mathematica .",
    "these components have also been calculated at a specific kinematic point and evaluated numerically by ellis , giele and zandereghi ( egz )  @xcite . for convenience",
    "we first examine the amplitudes at this kinematic point using the published numerical values .    in table",
    "[ sixpointn4 ] we extract the @xmath0 amplitudes and split them into their @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath62 pieces .",
    "we also look at the combination @xmath63 .",
    "if the amplitudes were exactly universal this combination would be identical for each helicity configuration .",
    "the numerical value of the tree amplitude is embedded within this table since the coefficient of @xmath6 is just @xmath64 .",
    "we have only included a single mhv amplitude since the combination @xmath63 is identical for the different mhv amplitudes . as we can see , despite the very different analytic forms of the nmhv expressions , the amplitudes are numerically almost universal .",
    ".the almost universal nature of the six - gluon @xmath0 amplitudes at the egz kinematic point . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "there are many surprises but no accidents in quantum field theory .",
    "we have been surprised by the almost universal nature of the one - loop amplitudes we have studied here .",
    "we have seen approximate universality in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory but not in pure gauge theory , minimally supersymmetric theories , nor @xmath65 supergravity .",
    "the main contributions to the scattering appear completely determined by the tree amplitude .",
    "explanations for this could be simply the amplitude being largely determined by its infrared behaviour , or more intriguingly , an indication of a broken symmetry such as dual conformal symmetry  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this behaviour beyond one loop and possibly relate it to some of the other remarkable results in the @xmath66-matrix of @xmath0 super - yang ",
