    "markov decision processes over continuous state spaces are an appropriate framework to study and formalize systems that involve continuously valued variables such as those arising in physics , biology , and economics ; and where some of those variables are known only in a probabilistic way .    in this direction ,",
    "_ labelled markov processes ( lmp ) _ were developed in @xcite by desharnais et alter .",
    "a lmp has a labelled set of _ actions _ that encode interaction with the environment ; thus lmp are a reactive model in which there are different transition subprobabilities for each action . in this model , uncertainty is ( only ) considered to be probabilistic ; therefore , lmp can be regarded as generalization of deterministic processes .",
    "intimately related to lmp are _ stochastic relations _",
    "@xcite ; lmp are exactly the stochastic kripke _",
    "frames_. it will be convenient , in search for motivation , to draw a panorama of the problems addressed by the present work in the context of lmp .",
    "there are several ways to face the problem of ` equivalence of behavior ' or _ bisimilarity _ for lmp .",
    "one possible but rather arbitrary way to classify them is as _ relational _ , _ coalgebraic _ and _ logical _ , and at the core of the matter that concerns us are the connections between these different roads .",
    "each one has its own advantages and sharp edges .    in the relational way",
    ", one uses some natural generalizations to continuous spaces of _ probabilistic bisimilarity _ as defined by larsen and skou @xcite . hence bisimulations and",
    "the relation of bisimilarity are simply binary relations on the base space .",
    "this way to define bisimulations is the standard one for kripke models and will play a central role in this paper .",
    "another , perhaps more important observation is that this relational view is _ internal _ : it only works inside a single process . when one wants to compare states in two different processes _ relationally _ , it s necessary to construct their direct sum first .",
    "since bisimulations in this sense have no structure ( they re plain sets of pairs ) facts as the transitivity of the relation of bisimilarity are straightforward .    in the coalgebraic view , @xcite there are two options for describing behavior of processes : coalgebraic bisimilarity is the existence of a span of zigzag morphisms and the concept of _ behavioral equivalence _ , which is given by a cospan of morphisms . here",
    "the problem of transitivity is not trivial .",
    "it can be shown by functorial manipulations that behavioral equivalence is transitive .",
    "but in the case of spans , this is a deep theorem .",
    "there are two approaches to this problem .",
    "one is to apply a technical lemma by edalat @xcite which ensures the existence of semipullbacks in the category of lmp over analytic spaces ; that is , every cospan can be completed to a commutative square .",
    "the second one allows the construction to be carried out without leaving the realm of polish spaces , in case one starts with a cospan of lmp over polish spaces .",
    "this was achieved by doberkat @xcite by using a selection argument .",
    "coalgebraic bisimilarity is a refinement of the relational view , since the mediating process ( the `` vertex '' of the span ) can be regarded as binary relation carrying a lmp structure .",
    "note , however , that the passage to the relational view is not completely smooth , since ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 1 ) shows that direct sum is not always compatible with coalgebraic bisimilarity .",
    "finally , in the logical view one fixes a variant of hennessy - milner modal logic .",
    "formulas of the modal logic can be regarded as tests on a process and we call two states _ logically equivalent _ if they satisfy exactly the same formulas",
    ". we do nt put logical equivalence under the `` relational approach '' since the main ingredients are the logical formulas ; moreover , logic is _",
    "external_. there is an alternative but equivalent view , called `` event bisimulation '' @xcite where emphasis is put on families of measurable subsets of the state space .",
    "the connection between these two is that the _ semantics ( or validity sets ) of hennessy - milner formulas are measurable sets _ for each interpretation ( process ) .",
    "this is a recurrent theme that will be exploited in our results .",
    "there is a generalization of this logical / event approach through the investigation of the lifting of countably generated equivalence relations to the space of probabilities @xcite .    as in older and related areas as kripke frames and models ,",
    "one of the main problems about lmp is to make a link between the logical and the other approaches , specially to relational and coalgebraic bisimilarity .",
    "for the former , the problem of _ logical characterization of bisimilarity _ on a class of processes consist in proving that ( relational ) bisimilarity is the same as logical equivalence for each process in the class .",
    "one of the cleanest way to do this is to apply the _ unique structure theorem _ for analytic spaces , as it was done in the work of danos et al .",
    "this works for the class of lmp with analytic state spaces , but it can be shown that both notions actually differ in the class of lmp over general measurable spaces , and that coalgebraic bisimilarity is not even transitive @xcite ( note that , trivially , logical equivalence is ) .",
    "our interest lies in models that include both probability and internal nondeterminism .",
    "these arise naturally , e.g. , by abstraction or underspecification of lmp . in the discrete case , the class of _ probabilistic automata _ is an example . over uncountable state spaces , the common generalization of lmp and probabilistic automata",
    "is given by _",
    "nondeterministic labelled markov processes ( nlmp ) _",
    "nlmp allow , for each state @xmath1 and each action @xmath2 , a ( possibly infinite ) set of probabilistic behaviors @xmath3 .",
    "deterministic nlmp ( i.e. , for which @xmath3 is a singleton for each @xmath4 ) are essentially the same as lmp .",
    "( it s worth to mention a very different approach to underspecification , using super - additive functions , proposed in @xcite . )    in @xcite the problem of defining appropriate notions of bisimulation and finding logical characterizations for bisimulation of nlmp was addressed .",
    "it turns out that there are three different notions of bisimilarity for these processes : traditional , state - based and event - based .",
    "the first two are `` relational '' in nature , and for deterministic nlmp they collapse to state bisimilarity .",
    "( it should be noted that a neat coalgebraic presentation of nlmp is still missing , so we wo nt be concerned with the coalgebraic approach in this work . )",
    "event bisimilarity is analogous to the concept for lmp bearing the same name and hence it is characterized by a logic , though one far more complex than hennessy - milner s .",
    "it has two levels and uncountably many formulas in the general case .",
    "indeed , we witness a similar phenomenon as in labelled transition systems ( lts ) vs.  modal logic , where some logical operators ( e.g. conjunction ) must have arity at least as the branching of the process . in our case",
    "we can do by just using countable conjunctions , in spite the sets @xmath3 may have the cardinality of the continuum . in any case , by using infinitary operators one is lead to an uncountable logic .",
    "nevertheless , the arguments used in @xcite can be generalized to encompass image - finite nlmp ( i.e. , having all the sets @xmath3 finite ) over analytic state spaces .",
    "actually , a proof strategy can be found in @xcite : every countable ` measurable ' logic @xmath5 satisfying certain local restrictions must characterize bisimilarity .",
    "( here we call a logic _ measurable _ if the validity set of each formula is a measurable subset of the state space . )",
    "both countability and measurability requirements are necessary for the proof to work .",
    "as far as we know , all approaches to the problem of logical characterization of bisimilarity need a logic satisfying these two properties .",
    "several examples in @xcite show that in the case of uncountable branching , our logic does not characterize neither of the relational bisimilarities considered , and that they are different .",
    "so the remaining case is the one of countably infinite branching . in this paper",
    "we show that the relation of bisimilarity is not borel in an appropriate countably branching process @xmath6 having a polish state space , and therefore we prove that there is no countable measurable logic that characterizes bisimilarity in any class of nlmp containing @xmath6 , thus banishing hope for using the current techniques for proving logical characterization .",
    "we will do this in two steps : first we ll see that the relation of bisimilarity on the space @xmath7 of all trees on @xmath8 is a non borel set ( actually , it is analytic - complete ) .",
    "we will then use @xmath7 to build the state space of @xmath6 , providing a nlmp structure .    in the next section we review some of the known results on nlmp , describing the available notions of bisimulation .",
    "most calculations in the paper will be carried on a nlmp where the sets @xmath3 consist entirely of point masses ( dirac s deltas ) .",
    "this simpler model has another , more practical , presentation which is essentially a lts over a measurable space ( section [ sec : measurable - lts ] ) .",
    "in section 3 we use some machinery of sequence spaces and unwinding of labelled transition systems to assess the complexity of the relation of bisimilarity .",
