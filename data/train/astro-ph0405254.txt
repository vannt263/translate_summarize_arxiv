    "the iron  complex is the strongest emission line in the x - ray spectra of magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) . in such stars",
    "an accretion shock above the white dwarf surface heats accreting material to 30 .",
    "the highly ionized , optically thin plasma then cools and settles onto the white dwarf , eventually becoming optically thick .",
    "the observed x - ray emission is thus the sum of contributions from a range of temperatures , densities , and optical depths ( e.g. , aizu 1973 ; cropper  1999 ) .    in principle",
    ", the emission lines will provide diagnostics of the accretion flow in mcvs [ see fujimoto &  ishida ( 1997 ) for a determination of white dwarf mass , and mauche , liedahl &  fournier ( 2001 ; 2003 ) for density diagnostics ] though the inhomogeneity of the accretion column complicates the interpretation .",
    "the relative contributions of collisional ionization and photo - ionization are also uncertain : mukai  ( 2003 ) argue that photo - ionization dominates the spectrum at high mass - accretion rates but not at lower rates",
    ".    early studies of the fe  line in mcvs ( e.g.  norton , watson &  king 1991 ) used data that had insufficient resolution to resolve the components from h - like , he - like and colder iron .",
    "this was first possible with the ccd detectors on the  satellite , which gave 120-  resolution . using  data ,",
    "hellier , mukai & osborne ( 1998 ) claimed that in some mcvs ( e.g.  v1223  sgr ) the three components were clearly resolved , whereas in others ( e.g.  ao  psc ) the components appeared broadened and blended .",
    "the 150-   broadening was attributed to compton scattering .",
    "the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) on  is a further advance : though it has a lower effective area than the  ccds , its 35-  resolution is sufficient to separate the three main components with ease , and to discern some of the structure within the components .",
    "the forthcoming  will be better still , with 6-  resolution and a high effective area . in this paper",
    "we report the appearance of the fe  complex at the -hetg resolution , based on a compilation of mcv spectra .",
    "five mcvs have so far been observed with the -hetg , namely ao  psc , am  her , ex  hya , v1223  sgr and gk  per .",
    "the observations are listed in table  1 . for each we extracted the heg ( high energy ) and meg ( medium energy ) spectra , combining the + 1 and 1 orders .",
    "the gk  per data consist of two observations taken during the 2002 outburst when the optical magnitudes were 11.0 and 10.5 . in our analysis",
    "we have summed the two spectra .",
    "the am  her spectra were obtained in an intermediate brightness state at an optical magnitude of 14 ; the ao  psc , v1223  sgr and ex  hya spectra were obtained in the usual state of these stars .",
    ".the observations and measured equivalent widths .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     fig .",
    "1 shows the iron  region of heg data for each star ( the meg data are not useful at this energy and so are not shown here , but see mukai  2003 ) .",
    "the division into three distinct components is clear in all cases , conflicting with hellier s ( 1998 ) report of blended lines , in particular in the  sis data of ao psc . to investigate this",
    "further we show in fig .  2 both the  heg and the  sis spectra of ao psc .",
    "the illustrative model is a power law and three gaussians fitted to the  data . the same model ( adjusting only the power - law normalisation )",
    "is shown plotted on the  data after folding through the  response .",
    "the  spectrum has a group of 4 high points between the h - like and he - like lines , explaining why the  spectrum is best fit by very broad , blended h - like and he - like lines .",
    "this is not supported by the higher - resolution  data ( though there are two high points in a similar place ) .",
    "overall we suggest that apparent broadening in the  spectrum is a statistical fluke , although a change in the source characteristics can not be ruled out , and we await an  spectrum to finally settle the issue .",
    "it is also possible that the narrow lines seen in the  data are accompanied by a broad , faint , compton - scattered base that is hard to detect in high - resolution but low - s / n grating spectra .",
    "indeed , this is expected to some degree ( see hellier  1998 ) , since the resonance lines are likely to be borderline optically thick , increasing the path length of resonance - line photons to the point where compton scattering is appreciable ( see also terada  2001 for the effect of resonance scattering on equivalent widths ) .",
    "the ` 6.97- ' line of fe xxvi consists of ly@xmath3 at 6.973  and , with theoretically half the intensity , ly@xmath4 at 6.952  [ these are transitions to @xmath5 from @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ] .",
    "dielectronic recombination leads to satellite lines at slightly lower energies in the range 6.916.95  ( the energy shift arises from the presence of a ` spectator ' electron in a higher-@xmath8 level ; strictly they are he - like lines , but occur near the h - like line since the second electron is not in the ground state and so does nt perturb the energy as much ) .",
    "calculations of the positions and intensities of the satellite lines are given by dubau  ( 1981 ) while observations of the h - like complex in the solar spectrum can be found in pike  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we can thus ask whether the satellite lines are contributing to the mcv spectra , although we ca nt resolve them at the heg resolution , their presence would shift the line centroid to the red .",
    "thus we used xspec s fakeit facility to find that narrow ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 components alone would , folded through the heg response and fitted with a gaussian , produce a line centroid of 6.964  with a width ( @xmath9 ) of 9 .    fitting the observed 6.97-  lines with a gaussian produced a redder centroid .",
    "a fit to all 5 stars simultaneously found a centroid of 6.958@xmath100.003 , with 6.964 ruled out at 90 per cent confidence .",
    "the measured width , at 24@xmath106 , was significantly greater than 9 .    to interpret this we need to consider possible doppler shifts , since the 6-  shift is equivalent to 260  and the broadening to 1000 .",
    "we thus repeated the analysis on the h - like lines of ne , mg and si , using the meg data .",
    "since the strength of satellite lines scales as @xmath11 , these lines should be free of satellites .",
    "we found no shifts to a 90-per - cent limit of 100  and no broadening to a limit of 450 .",
    "this does nt completely exclude doppler shifts in the fe lines , since the fe emission centroid will be hotter and higher up the accretion column , where velocities are larger .",
    "however , the low level of any doppler shifts suggests that the observed shift in h - like fe is instead caused by the presence of satellite lines .",
    "the lack of doppler shifts to a limit of 100  is somewhat surprising , considering that the escape velocity of a 0.7-  white dwarf is 5000 .",
    "however , the infall velocity drops by a factor 4 through the stand - off shock , and reduces further as the material cools and settles onto the white dwarf ( scaling with height as @xmath12 ; e.g. , frank , king &  raine 2002 ) .",
    "since the density scales inversely to the velocity , and since the x - ray emissivity depends on density squared , the emission is predominantly from low - velocity material close to the white dwarf surface .",
    "further , the projection onto the line of sight , and the fact that the projected motions will be smeared out over the spin cycle , can reduce the observed velocities by another factor 23 .",
    "thus the observed 100-  limit is explained if the emission arises predominantly from the lowest few per cent of the accretion column .",
    "the ` 6.7- ' line of fe xxv consists of the resonance line , @xmath13 , a forbidden line , @xmath14 , and two intercombination lines , @xmath15 [ being transitions to the ground state @xmath16 from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively ] .",
    "interspersed with these are dielectronic satellite lines over the range 6.616.68 .",
    "the relative line intensities depend on temperature , density , the degree of photoionization , and the extent to which the resonance line is depleted by compton scattering ( which is greatly enhanced by resonant trapping of such photons ) . calculations of the 6.7-  complex can be found in bautista & kallman ( 2000 ) and oelgoetz &  pradhan ( 2001 ) .",
    "such calculations indicate that satellite lines will dominate the 6.7-  complex at temperatures below 3k , with the he - triplet components dominating at higher temperatures .    at the  resolution the different components",
    "are not resolved , but some tentative statements can be made .",
    "the ao  psc spectrum is compatible with a strong resonance component and contributions from the forbidden lines , or nearby satellites .",
    "the relative strength of the resonance line implies a temperature of @xmath203k [ see the diagnostic curves in bautista &  kallman ( 2000 ) and oelgoetz & pradhan ( 2001 ) ] .",
    "in contrast , in the am  her spectrum the resonance line appears weaker , with the intercombination lines , or adjacent satellites , appearing strongest .",
    "one possibility is that resonant scattering is affecting this line ( a resulting beaming of resonance - line photons is already thought to be important in some am her stars ; terada  2001 ) .    alternatively",
    ", a weak resonance line could result from a low temperature of @xmath212k ( @xmath212 ) . at such temperatures",
    "the line will be dominated by satellite lines , assuming that collisional equilibrium holds .",
    "a low temperature is consistent with the lack of doppler shifts , since @xmath22 , so that the observed 100-  limit implies a temperature in the line emitting region of 0.2@xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand , ishida  ( 1997 ) deduce a temperature of 1015  from the line ratios observed in the  spectrum of am  her , which is incompatible with our interpretation .",
    "both of these temperature estimates are based on barely - resolved line data , so we await for more reliable results .",
    "a possible explanation for am her being different from ao psc is that am her , being a polar , has a much stronger magnetic field of 14 mg ( bailey , ferrario &  wickramasinghe 1991 ) , whereas the other stars have weaker fields of 1 mg . thus cyclotron cooling will be important in am her , but not in the others .",
    "the ex  hya data suggest a strong resonance line , along with @xmath15 , and @xmath14 and/or satellites .",
    "overall , the ratio of he - like / h - like equivalent widths is very different from that in the other systems ( table  1 ) .",
    "similarly , mukai  ( 2003 ) found that the ex  hya spectrum is unlike that of other magnetic mcvs , being compatible with a collisionally - excited , cooling - flow model , whereas others showed photoionized spectra .",
    "the difference is probably due to the much lower accretion rate and luminosity of ex  hya , which are in line with it being the only system in our sample below the period gap .",
    "the fluorescence line peaks near 6.41  in all stars , compatible with cold iron in states fe i to fe xvii .",
    "there is little sign of iron at ionizations between xvii and xxv .",
    "the gk  per fluorescent line has the highest s / n .",
    "it has a red wing extending to 6.33 , consistent with a doppler shift of up to 3700 .",
    "we suggest that this arises from pre - shock material , which will be falling at near the white - dwarf escape velocity .",
    "further , the gk  per line appears to have a fainter shoulder to its red wing , extending to 170  from the line centre .",
    "we suggest that these are photons compton downscattered by up to two compton wavelengths .",
    "it is notable that gk  per s fluorescent line has an equivalent width more than a factor two greater than seen in the other systems ( table  1 ) .",
    "since this line arises from scattering of the emitted x - rays , the equivalent width will be set primarily by the size of the scattering targets , namely the white dwarf ( filling half the solid angle as seen from the emission region ) and the inflowing material .    in most mcvs material",
    "accretes only over a small range of magnetic longitude , as deduced from eclipse studies of the size of the emission region ( e.g.  hellier 1997 ) , and from the blackbody areas of regions of heated white - dwarf surface ( e.g.  haberl &  motch 1995 ) .",
    "thus the ` accretion curtains ' of infalling material are a small target compared to the white dwarf , in keeping with the fact that the fluorescent lines are not doppler - shifted wholesale .    however , from an analysis of the spin - cycle pulsation of gk  per , hellier , harmer &  beardmore ( 2004 ) claimed that , during outburst , the material accretes from all azimuths to form a complete accretion ring .",
    "this would fill most of the sky , as seen from the emission region , thus greatly enhancing the equivalent width of the fluorescent line . in keeping with this idea",
    "the fluorescent line observed in quiescence by  is much weaker , with an equivalent width of only 50  ( hellier  1998 ) .",
    "we present the first compilation of fe -line spectra of mcvs using the -hetg .",
    "we conclude that :            \\(5 ) the absence of doppler shifts and the hints of structure in the he - like line are encouraging for observations with the xrs on the forthcoming .",
    "its 6-  resolution will separate the different he - triplet and satellite lines , allowing the application of temperature diagnostics .",
    "\\(6 ) the fluorescence line in gk  per shows a doppler - shifted red wing owing to pre - shock material falling at near the escape velocity .",
    "we also detect a fainter , 170-  shoulder caused by compton down - scattering .",
    "the high equivalent width of gk  per s fluorescence line supports the suggestion by hellier  ( 2004 ) that , during outburst , the accretion flows from all azimuths to form a complete accretion ring .",
