    "the first detections of exoplanets are now 2 decades old @xcite and over 700 confirmed and @xmath03000 candidate exoplanets @xcite are now known .",

    "the fundamental limitation on the detection of these low mass exoplanets is no longer just instrumental , but also astrophysical @xcite .",
    "stellar analogs of solar activity features such as faculae , starspots , stellar flares , and stellar cycles induce time dependent variations on the observed brightness and spectra of stars",
    ". these can be large enough to mask or imitate planetary companions @xcite with the largest impact on the detection of low mass planets .",
    "stellar models , long term observations , and higher resolutions can help address these effects @xcite , but often at high observational cost .",
    "a well known example is the proposed earth - mass planet orbiting @xmath1 cen b in a 3-day orbit @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the significance of the signal depends on the method used to treat the activity - induced rv from the star , with some epochs exhibiting an activity - induced rv amplitude of 7 m s@xmath2 .",
    "stellar noise has also led to controversy regarding several of the low mass planet candidates orbiting the m dwarf gl 667c @xcite with activity related signals discussed by @xcite .",
    "the system of most controversy has been gl 581 and its multiple , proposed , hz super - earths .",
    "recently , these have been shown to actually be stellar activity signals @xcite .",
    "this result not only shows how stellar activity can appear to be planetary signals , but correcting for these stellar signals boosts the signal of the real planets .",
    "identifying how to minimize astrophysical systematics , especially with regard to stellar activity , is thus extremely important to confirm the small exoplanets , as also shown recently by @xcite for the corot-7 system .    over the past few centuries studying our sun",
    "has helped us to understand stellar activity and stellar processes .",
    "initial observations involved counting sunspots , which was later followed by the identification of large flares , and the space age bringing details about coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . @xcite tied most of the variable characteristics of the sun to the solar magnetic field through the @xmath3 dynamo @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 dynamo is based on magnetic field lines being stretched , wound , and twisted by the sun s rotation , especially differential rotation between the sun s convective and radiative layers .",
    "another small scale variation is contributed by granulation on the surface due to the convective nature of the underlying layer @xcite . both of these effects manifest as photometric variability for the sun and for other stars @xcite .",

    "* ) , and the infrared spectropolarimeter ( spirou ; * ? ? ?",

    "using data provided by the solar radiation and climate experiment spacecraft ( sorce ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have undertaken a study of solar noise as a function of wavelength and time .",
    "we estimate rvs from sorce data using the photometric f / f technique @xcite . section 2 briefly discusses our understanding of solar and stellar activity , ",
    "3 discusses the f / f method , and in  4 , the sorce observations and spacecraft are described .",
    "section 5  discusses the analysis including the implementation of the f / f method .",
    "the results are presented in  6 and  7 contains a discussion . in  8 ,",
    "this work is summarized and future potential work is presented .",
    "the sun was long considered to have a constant irradiance , i.e. the solar constant , but was also known to be variable through sunspots and solar flares .",
    "the advent of space - based radiometers has allowed the small changes in the solar constant to be measured precisely .",
    "these changes can be tied to physical features including sunspots , p - mode oscillations , granulation , faculae , plages , and supergranulation @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that similar features are responsible for variations observed on other stars as well , and are driven by the magnetic field , @xmath3 dynamo , and convection .",
    "these features manifest on different timescales and in different observable ways .",
    "temporally , p - mode oscillations and granulation show variations on the shortest timescales ( minutes to hours ) .",
    "granulation , sunspots , faculae , and plages are responsible for the variation up to a few days , with sunspots driving variability on timescales similar to the rotation period @xcite .",
    "these effects are known to be wavelength dependent .",
    "sunspots change the observed brightness highly in the visible but less in the infrared @xcite while granulation may affect all of the spectrum .",
    "these features also affect observations of the surface kinematics @xcite .",
    "granulation is an upwelling driven by the motion of the solar material @xcite , while sunspots , faculae and other magnetically driven phenomena can add or subtract flux with different doppler velocities .",
    "the decrease or addition of velocity shifted emission is observed in other stars and alters measurements of the absolute rvs @xcite . any activity - induced shift in rv ; random , coherent , or periodic will impact the detection of planets around other stars .",
    "simulations of the impact of stellar activity on rvs have been conducted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we seek in this work to use actual spectro - photometric observations of the sun to explore the rv variability as a function of wavelength .",
    "despite the plethora of observations of the sun , obtaining an integrated rv measurement is difficult .",
    "the resolved nature of the sun means one must either integrate the flux over the sun s solid angle or observe reflected light from other objects .",
    "the first was demonstrated using the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and showed agreement with simulations to within 30% .",
    "preliminary results from the second method are detailed by @xcite using the high - accuracy radial velocity planetary searcher spectrograph ( harps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and reflected light from the asteroid vesta .",
    "this method introduces additional factors that must be accounted for such as the asteroid s properties , its rotation , and its velocity .",
    "more importantly , obtaining the measurements needed for a long - term rv characterization of the sun is observationally expensive requiring many nights of observing to acquire sufficient data .    in this work",
    "we estimate solar rv variability as a function of wavelength using the f / f method developed by @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on a simplified spot model that converts observed stellar fluxes into estimated rv variations .",
    "starspots , being cooler than their surroundings , emit less light .",
    "because these spots are spatially distributed , the lower emission comes from specific regions that would normally have a doppler shift due to rotation and convection .",
    "the spots suppress these regions s contributions to the integrated flux , shifting the measured rv .",
    "this effect can cause scatter or coherent signals that can suppress or masquerade as the signals of planets .",
    "the f / f method attempts to replicate the rv variability that would be observed if the sun was an unresolved source .",
    "the governing formulae are :    @xmath4    @xmath5 ^ 2 + \\frac{\\dot{\\psi(t)}}{\\psi_0}\\left[1-\\frac{\\psi(t)}{\\psi_0}\\right]\\frac{r_\\star}{f } \\label{eq : two}\\ ] ]    equation [ eq : one ] shows that the total rv variation ( @xmath6 ) estimated by the f / f method is the sum of the estimated convective component ( @xmath7 ) and the estimated rotational component ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the convective component comes from the suppression of the convective blueshift in spot regions while the rotational component is the rv signature of spots reducing light from different regions with different rotational velocities .",
    "these terms are then broken down in equation [ eq : two ] into the components that can be measured from the photometry or modeled .",
    "@xmath9 is the difference between the convective blueshift in the spot region and the normal photosphere , @xmath10 is the ratio of the magnetized area to the spot surface , @xmath11 is the maximum measured flux , @xmath12 is the measured flux , @xmath13 is the derivative of the flux , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the minimum observed flux , and @xmath16 is the radius of the sun .",
    "while the f / f technique can be used to estimate an rv shift , it is worth emphasizing that it yields only an incomplete ( albeit powerful ) account of activity related rv noise .",
    "for example , it does not consider the photometric effect of faculae ( which can lead to the suppression of the convective blueshift ) .",
    "@xcite invoked an additional activity function to supplement the f / f technique in their analysis of the corot-7 system , though this is only useful if simultaneous precision photometry and rv data are available .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the f / f technique alone can give results equivalent to those of long term , conventional rv measurements .",
    "data from the microvariability and oscillations of stars mission ( most ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations from the sophie spectrograph @xcite showed good agreement between the spectral and photometric rvs for hd 189733 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the f / f method showed good agreement when comparing synthetic solar photometry and rv datasets .",
    "we use the f / f technique to calculate solar rv variability derived from space - based spectrophotometric observations from the sorce spacecraft .",
    "while this ignores sources of rv variability that the f / f technique does not account for , we believe it is suitable for our purpose which is to probe the rv variability as a function of wavelength .",
    "sorce is a nasa sponsored spacecraft mission launched in 2003 as part of nasa s earth observing system @xcite .",
    "the main mission of sorce is to measure the incoming solar radiation , its variations , and its properties from the x - ray and ultraviolet wavelengths through the near - infrared    the sorce spacecraft itself consists of four instruments : the total irradiance monitor ( tim ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spectral irradiance monitor ( sim ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the solar stellar irradiance comparison experiment ( solstice ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the xuv photometer system ( xps ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work uses data from sim and tim .",
    "because sorce was built for a different science goal than we are using it for , the instruments , specifically sim , must be well understood to derive results accurate for our needs .",
    "tim is responsible for measuring the total solar irradiance ( tsi ) .",
    "tim does this using an electrical substitution radiometer ( esr ) with 4 bolometers and an aperture of 0.5 @xmath17 ( total incident flux @xmath065mw ) . the esr uses these 4 bolometers in 2 pairs . within each pair",
    ", one bolometer is exposed to sunlight and allowed to absorb the incident irradiance .",
    "the other bolometer is then heated to match the first .",
    "the amount of energy needed to bring the bolometers into equilibrium is equal to the amount of solar irradiance absorbed .",
    "using this setup , tim is able to measure the tsi to an accuracy of parts per million @xcite while maintaining accuracy and measuring ( and compensating ) for degradation using the two pairs .",
    "this is some of the highest precision photometry ever achieved , exceeding that of the _ kepler _ mission by a factor of @xmath185 . for full instrument description",
    "see @xcite .",
    "sim is the primary instrument of interest for this study .",
    "it observes the ssi over a wavelength span of 200 to 2700 nm @xcite .",
    "its design is a dual fery prism spectrometer . to observe over this wavelength span , sim uses 5 different detectors and observes an integrated irradiance of @xmath01320 w m@xmath19 .",
    "for discussion of missing irradiance ] solar radiation incident on the instrument can take one of three paths through the instrument .",
    "these paths allow the spectral irradiance to be measured ( spectrometer path ) , the instrument to be wavelength calibrated ( wavelength control path ) , or the instrument s degradation to be measured ( prism transmission path ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary detector , used for calibration and large wavelength measurements , is an esr which uses two independent bolometers and initially places them in temperature equilibrium via heating from resistors .",
    "one of the surfaces is then exposed to the radiant energy of the sun .",
    "the heating from the resistor for the active bolometer is then reduced until the surface temperatures return to equilibrium .",
    "the electrical power reduction is then equal to the radiant energy incident on the bolometer to within the noise limit @xcite .",
    "the esr can measure the irradiance over the total 255 - 2700 nm range , however , it is not suitable for spectral scanning purposes due to its slow response time .",
    "therefore , the esr is used more for calibration of the other 4 detectors .",

    "two of the silicon photodiodes are designed with n - p silicon geometry along with a nitride passivated sio@xmath20 layer to make them sensitive and stable in the uv .",
    "these two detectors , uv and vis1 , cover wavelengths of 200 - 308 nm and 310 - 1000 nm respectively .",
    "the final silicon photodiode ( vis2 ) has p - n silicon geometry and has a wavelength coverage of 360 - 1000 nm .",
    "finally , sim has an ingaas photodiode used for ir irradiance measurements .",
    "this detector has a wavelength coverage of 944 - 1655 nm .",
    "these 5 detectors allow sim to measure the ssi with high accuracy over 97% of the solar spectral energy distribution .",
    "the resolution of sim changes over the wavelength range covered . from 200 to 400 nm the fwhm of the resolution elements is less than 5 nm .",
    "the resolution increases up to a peak of around 20 - 30 nm near 1200 nm , before slowly decreasing .",
    "the sim mission began in 2003 and lasted until 2011 at which time a power cycling mode was initiated due to a battery failure .",
    "therefore , the sim database provides an almost continuous dataset of daily solar spectral irradiance measurements for nearly 8 years with the interruptions in the observations listed in table [ tab : events ] .      due to sim s design ,",
    "a number of systematic effects have to be taken into account when using the data for our needs .",
    "specifically , in the 800 - 1000 nm region the quantum efficiency of the photodiodes is strongly dependent on their temperature due to the way they are biased .",
    "this introduces an increased systematic uncertainty that can not fully be accounted for and the data in this region have been excluded from our analysis .",
    "our analysis showed that this effect is still present down to 760 nm .",
    "additionally , the esr is the only detector available for measurements past 1600 nm .",
    "wavelengths longer than 1600 nm have not been included in our analysis due to the esr s larger uncertainty .",
    "tim measures tsi every 6 hours in addition to providing a daily value .",
    "this allows comparisons to be made between spectral frequency and total irradiance variations ( ie .",
    "comparison of the sim and tim measurements ) .",
    "integrating the sim measurements yields an average measured irradiance of 1319.1 w m@xmath19 ( 97% of the measured tsi ) with a standard deviation of 0.63 w m@xmath19 over the entire mission .",
    "the sim flux values over the entire wavelength coverage for 2006 january 29 are shown as an example in figure [ fig : sim ] along with the integrated flux for that day .",
    "the average tsi value is 1360.7 w m@xmath19 with a standard deviation of 0.3 w m@xmath19 .",
    "the missing 40 w m@xmath19 of energy from sim is distributed with @xmath014 w m@xmath19 emitted in the fuv and x - rays , and the remainder emitted in the infrared tail .",
    "the sim and tim datasets were retrieved from the sorce website and provided daily measurements of the total and spectral irradiance from 2003 april to 2011 april .",
    "these data sets were fairly continuous , with breaks described by the instrument and spacecraft events in table [ tab : events ] .",
    "each data set provides the time of observation and the irradiance value ( either total or at each wavelength of observation ) with the same cadence as the synthetic solar data used by @xcite .",
    "the same technique as used by @xcite can therefore be applied to the sorce data to estimate the rv variations that would be observed due to sunspots and convection .    to estimate the rv shift , the quantities described in equation [ eq : two ] need to be calculated or estimated .",
    "these quantities estimate the rotational and convective rv variations .",
    "the measured flux @xmath12 , the maximum measured flux @xmath11 , and @xmath21 were taken from the observed sim and tim irradiance datasets .",
    "@xmath13 , is the derivative of the irradiance and was found from the sim and tim light curves using a simple spline model fit and its derivative . to mitigate transient effects from introducing large changes in the derivative ,",
    "the light curve was smoothed with a 3-day boxcar .",
    "this is the same technique as applied in @xcite where the smoothing width is equal to approximately one - tenth the rotation period .",
    "an additional check on the behavior of the derivative was made using the difference between neighboring points .",
    "both results produced similar amplitudes for the derivative .",
    "the final quantity that is known is @xmath16 , the radius of the sun @xcite .",
    "the two quantities that are not known precisely are @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "these two quantities significantly affect @xmath7 and therefore @xmath6 as well .",
    "@xcite fit for @xmath10 and @xmath9 as one quantity with values of @xmath22 ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 m s@xmath2 . for our calculations",
    ", we chose @xmath25 400 m s@xmath2 , which was fitted for the active solar case .",
    "this value is important as it increases the contribution of the estimated convective rv scatter to the total rv scatter .",
    "this value was adopted for a number of reasons ; @xcite fitted for this value using synthetic tsi values thus removing any dependance on our data set and these synthetic values overlapped with our observations so should be accurate for the solar cycle of interest .",
    "we do note that the choice of a constant does affect the time - dependent analysis as @xmath10 does change with the solar cycle and with wavelength .",
    "this should only have the effect that the values estimated during the solar quiescent period are to be taken as upper limits .",
    "the analysis described above resulted in estimated @xmath26rvs from the tsi and ssi as a function of time , the latter also as a function of wavelength .",
    "figure [ fig : stdev ] shows the standard deviation of the ssi @xmath26rvs over the entire mission .",
    "the greyed regions are excluded due to additional noise sources from detector effects ( see section [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that the @xmath26rvs decrease in variability with increasing wavelength . in the uv higher variability",
    "is seen , decreasing throughout the visible , and eventually reaching a floor around a standard deviation of 0.3 m s@xmath2 .",
    "the subplots show the data in the harps and hpf bandpasses .",
    "the visible wavelengths covered by harps still contain significant variation .",
    "this variability has an inverse relationship with increasing wavelength .",
    "the nir bandpass shows little variation with wavelength .",
    "additionally , the observed nir variation has a lower overall magnitude than in the visible .",
    "this data suggests that when searching for low mass planet rv signals , the nir will have a lower stellar rv component .",
    "some caveats are important in making this claim :    * the advantage of the nir spectrographs becomes truly important if they can reach levels of precision comparable , or not significantly worse , than the state of the art in optical rv spectrographs .",
    "this statement hold both for instrument limits on rv precision as well as photon & information content limited rv precision ( see sec 7.4 for a more detailed discussion of the latter ) . * due to the lower information content in the nir and red for f , g , and k stars as compared to the remainder of the optical @xcite , nir instruments will have to be on larger telescopes or be limited to studying activity on the brightest stars to identify the smallest planets .",
    "this condition does not apply to the mid to late m dwarfs where nir instruments are competitive with optical spectrographs from an information content perspective .",
    "* we assume observed stellar activity is magnetic activity and is manifested by spots , faculae , prominences , and flares with driving physics similar to our sun albeit of varying magnitudes .",
    "the wealth of data from the sorce mission , with the f / f method , has permitted the estimation of the rv variation that would be observed if we were observing the sun from a distant planet .",
    "the main result from this work is that the rv variability in the nir is less than that in the optical for the sun , and by proxy for solar type stars .. we further examine our results , with a focus on time variability , to better understand the relative contributions from the two components used in the f / f method .",
    "the f / f method consists of two components to the total estimated @xmath26rv , that from convection and from rotation .",
    "the convective term is a blueshift from the upwelling of material seen at the photosphere .",
    "the rotation term is due to spot coverage and relies on the decreased emission from spot regions associated with a particular radial component of the rotational velocity .",
    "it is the combination of these terms that the f / f method uses to derive the rv variability .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows the total @xmath26rv , the convective @xmath26rv , and the rotational @xmath26rv over our entire baseline .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] shows that the tsi consistently estimates the lowest @xmath26rv .",
    "this is expected as activity mechanisms influence the blue wavelengths more than the integrated output of the sun .",
    "the sim and tim data show that the tsi changes by @xmath01.3 w m@xmath19 while the uv ( 240 - 400 nm ) and visible ( 400 - 750 nm ) each change by @xmath02 w m@xmath19 , though in opposite directions , over the solar cycle .",
    "the uv flux correlates with tsi , decreasing towards solar minimum , while the visible increases during the same time period and with the same amplitude showing evidence for this higher variability .",
    "therefore , the tsi estimated @xmath26rvs should represent a floor when using the f / f method .",
    "we note that this is different from the case of simultaneous photometry from kepler or corot as these bands are fairly well matched to the optical rv instruments used to confirm planets .",
    "also seen is that the nir @xmath26rvs are lower than the visible @xmath26rvs consistently over the entire mission , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev ] .    for the convective @xmath26rvs , the same wavelength dependence applies as for the total @xmath26rv .",
    "we draw the reader s attention to the number of sunspots and the k emission index @xcite plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "we can see that , except for the initial values , the number of sunspots has an inverse relationship to the convective @xmath26rv .",
    "finally the third panel shows the rotational @xmath26rv contribution .",
    "this plot shows that the tsi , nir , and visible appear indistinguishable .",
    "we again see a relationship with the number of sunspots .",
    "as the number reaches a minimum in the solar cycle , the rotational term shows less scatter approaching zero .",
    "this is expected as when there are few to no sunspots , the mechanism that the f / f method relies on for this contribution is not present .",
    "the long baseline of the sorce mission allowed the analysis of estimated rv variation as a function of both time and wavelength .",
    "this data is presented in figure [ fig : monthly ] which shows the standard deviation of the estimated rv variation each month as a function of wavelength and time .",
    "additionally , the tsi is over plotted on top of the tsi - estimated rv variation . the wavelength range that is considered unreliable",
    "is whited out along with months corresponding to instrument events ( table 1 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the sim data vary in resolution with wavelength .",
    "the resolution functional form is given in figure 10 of @xcite .",
    "the resolution changes from 1 nm at 300 nm , to 10 nm near 600 nm , and to a maximum of @xmath1820 nm near 1200 nm .",
    "our results agree with our initial hypothesis that the nir is reliably the region of lowest variability .",
    "over most of the mission , the nir shows a lower variation , although near the solar minimum ( months 60 - 80 ) the visible reaches a variability on par with the nir .",
    "the conclusion drawn from this graph is that , the nir will show lower rv variability for solar type stars than the optical .",
    "if one has knowledge and is able to observe during the stellar cycle minimum , however , the visible variability should be on the same level as that in the nir .",
    "additionally , we note that fig .",
    "[ fig : monthly ] shows vertical streaks .",
    "some of these coincide with known spectral lines , including lines sensitive to activity .",
    "the strongest line seen in this analysis ( not shown ) is actually in the uv and corresponds to the h&k lines .",
    "these lines are an order of magnitude more variable than any shown within fig .",
    "[ fig : monthly ] . in the figure ,",
    "some of the vertical streaks correspond to wavelengths of ; @xmath0656 nm , around h@xmath1 ; @xmath0590 nm , around the doublet ; @xmath0519 nm , near the triplet ; and @xmath0392 and 396 nm , corresponding to ca h & k. we note that h@xmath1 and ca h & k lines are known activity indicators @xcite .",
    "the d lines have also been explored as an activity tracer in cool stars @xcite , but those lines are photon - dominated in hotter stars .",
    "all of these are approximate locations as the line width of the features in the plot is due to the resolution of the instrument which leads to uncertainty in the wavelength .      in section 5",
    ", we noted that our choice of @xmath22 was taken from @xcite and set to be 400 m s@xmath2 .",
    "this value was fitted for by @xcite from synthetic data which overlapped with our data set and was the value for the active sun .",
    "we stress that while using a constant value prevents the values shown from being a perfectly accurate representation of reality , it does not prevent the comparison between wavelengths and with time .",
    "this value should decrease as the stellar cycle gets quieter , meaning that our values shown during the quiet period are upper limits .",
    "the choice of a constant @xmath22 has an additional effect on the estimated rv noise as a function of wavelength .",
    "different wavelengths probe different heights in the solar atmosphere and thus may be subject to different physical conditions , which can affect @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , any wavelength dependance in the spot covering fraction would be due to a depth - dependent change in the spot size , which is not constrained by current data @xcite .",
    "this topic must be revisited for future f / f applications as this is the first application to specific wavelengths instead of to large bandpasses or to the tsi .",
    "the overall reduction in f / f estimated stellar rv noise in the nir supports the possibility of the use of new nir instruments , such as hpf , to observe bright solar - type stars .",
    "this claim is not without caveats .",
    "specifically for f & g stars , the nir is hampered by the reduction in suitable spectral lines , an increase in telluric lines , and decreased emission from the stars @xcite .",
    "although the blackbody peaks of solar - types stars lie at visible wavelengths instead of in the nir , they should still prove to be suitable targets if significantly brighter than the m & k dwarfs that will be the primary targets of these instruments .",
    "the information content available and contamination from telluric lines are major obstacles that any nir observers must consider .",
    "if the rv noise is indeed lower , as implied by our f / f measurements , then these instruments may be able to unambiguously observe the rv signatures of smaller planets , in addition to supporting the observations of optical instruments .",
    "we feel that the nir instruments will be especially useful in disentangling activity from real planetary signals for solar type stars .      the data used in this paper came from v19 of the sim data release .",

    "variability is lower in the nir , even though the two reductions show slightly different slopes and variability in sim data .",
    "we present the results of our f / f analysis of the sun using the sorce spacecraft . applying the method of @xcite to the spectral irradiance data provided by the sim instrument showed that the nir has lower estimated rv noise than the optical .",
    "this is true over the entire stellar cycle suggesting that nir instruments can play an important role in the detection and confirmation of low mass planets .",
    "the effects of stellar activity on the detection of exoplanets has been seen and continue to present a problem .",
    "additional work should continue to determine both the best methods to confirm exoplanets ( such as in what bandpass to observe ) and on how to remove stellar rv signals from rv observations without affecting the signals of planets .",
    "additional applications of the f / f method to other stars as well as to the sun can help refine the technique and prove its validity .",
    "finally , a suitable nir activity indicator should be sought to aid in observations of f , g , and k stars with nir instruments .",

    "<S> using solar spectral irradiance measurements from the sorce spacecraft and the f / f technique , we have estimated the radial velocity ( rv ) scatter induced on the sun by stellar activity as a function of wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> our goal was to evaluate the potential advantages of using new near - infrared ( nir ) spectrographs to search for low - mass planets around * bright * f , g , and k stars by beating down activity effects . unlike m dwarfs , which have higher fluxes and therefore greater rv information content in the nir , solar - type stars are brightest at visible wavelengths , and , based solely on information content , are better suited to traditional optical rv surveys . however , we find that the f / f estimated rv noise induced by stellar activity is diminished by up to a factor of 4 in the nir versus the visible </S>",
    "<S> . observations with the upcoming future generation of nir instruments can be a valuable addition to the search for low - mass planets around bright fgk stars in reducing the amount of stellar noise affecting rv measurements . </S>"
