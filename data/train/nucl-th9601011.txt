    "it has recently been found in theoretical investigations that in quark - hadron phase transition ( pt ) there are hadronic observables that exhibit scaling behavior @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is based on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) description of second - order pt .",
    "subsequently , the consideration has been extended to first - order pt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "besides the unique features of the qcd dynamics , what distinguishes the problem from the standard critical phenomena such as ferromagnetism is the lack of control of the temperature in a heavy - ion collision and the availability of only the hadrons as observables . together with the complications in the nonperturbative regime of qcd , these difficulties preclude at this stage any observable predictions that follow from first principles . for that reason",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory has been used as the framework for quark - hadron pt , in which quantitative predictions on the hadronic observables can be derived and compared with experiment @xcite .",
    "however , it is a mean - field theory that is accurate only in high dimensions . in the ising model",
    "the upper critical dimension is four , above which the critical exponents determined in the theory is exact . the physical problem in heavy - ion collision , however , has dimension @xmath9 , as we shall argue below .",
    "it is therefore important to consider the ising model in @xmath9 for quark - hadron pt , and compare its scaling behavior , if existent , with that derived in the gl theory .",
    "it is also useful to consider the @xmath10 case so that the scaling result can be checked against the mean - field result . in that way one can gain some insight on",
    "whatever discrepancy there may exist between the gl and @xmath1 ising results .",
    "those are the problems that we shall investigate in this paper .",
    "the use of ising model as a solvable problem to study particle production has been done by many authors in the past several years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the focus has been on the issue of intermittency @xcite , i.e. , power - law behavior of the normalized factorial moments as functions of the bin size .",
    "differences in their conclusions appear to depend largely on how a particle is defined in terms of the lattice spins and how the limit of large @xmath11 ( number of lattice sites ) is taken . in those papers that are specifically concerned with the @xmath12 ising model ,",
    "no pt is contemplated . in the gl formalism",
    "it has been found analytically that there is no intermittency @xcite ; nevertheless , there is a different scaling behavior , called @xmath13-scaling , for which a numerical scaling exponent @xmath4 has been determined .",
    "we want to check the value of @xmath4 in the ising model .",
    "one of the shortcomings of the gl approach is that the phase transition described by it is spatially too smooth . in a heavy - ion collision one",
    "expects hadrons to be formed one at a time or in clusters at the surface of a quark - gluon plasma ( if created ) with large spatial fluctuations .",
    "the ising model is well suited to improve on that aspect of the problem",
    ". we shall consider cells as basic units consisting of several lattice sites , and vary the size of bins that contain certain multiples of the basic cells . in that way the model problem simulates the real situation in a much better approximation .",
    "the fluctuations that we study can not be analyzed analytically , so computer simulation will be essential in carrying out the investigation .",
    "our study in @xmath2 can help to elucidate the question whether the difference between the gl and @xmath1 ising results is due to the specific dimension chosen or to the modified definition of hadrons in the ising system .",
    "the conventional picture of a heavy - ion collision that creates a quark - gluon plasma is an expanding cylinder of quarks and gluons with temperature @xmath5 high in the interior , lower on the surface .",
    "if the plasma undergoes a second - order pt to hadrons , then there is no mixed phase , and the surface of the cylinder is where the pt takes place at @xmath14 , the critical temperature .",
    "after the hadrons are formed , they leave the plasma and are decoupled from the system under consideration . thus focusing on the cylinder surface",
    "only , we are dealing with a two - dimensional system of quarks and gluons , which has patches that hadronize but are immediately replaced by the same quark system underneath after the hadrons are removed .",
    "the hadronization patches fluctuate in location and in size , as time evolves .",
    "what we shall analyze is the spatial fluctuation at any given time .",
    "if time is integrated over , which is equivalent to collecting all the emitted hadrons from the beginning to the end of the hadronization process , then the fluctuations we seek would be smoothened out by the overlap of hadrons produced at different times . thus in order to see the fluctuations in the experimental data ( apart from the complications arising from the possibility of hadron gas , which is a totally different issue , not to be considered here ) , it is necessary to make @xmath15 cuts .",
    "that is based on the general feature that the average @xmath15 decreases with increasing time due to the decrease of transverse pressure , as the longitudinal and transverse expansion progresses .",
    "so selecting a narrow range of @xmath15 has the effect of selecting a narrow time range of hadronization , during which the spatial fluctuations can be frozen in the data @xcite .",
    "the above discussion forms the basis of our consideration of a two - dimensional system for the second - order quark - hadron pt .",
    "we unfold a finite section of the cylinder at midrapidity and map it onto a square lattice . to treat the pt problem on this lattice in the framework of the ising model",
    "requires a careful consideration of what constitutes a hadron .",
    "various definitions have been used in refs . @xcite-@xcite ; the most common one associates spin up to a particle at a site . that may be satisfactory for particle production without pt , but is unsatisfactory for our purpose because for @xmath16 there should be no hadrons produced except for those produced due to fluctuating effects .",
    "our definition is the result of a long chain of reasoning , which goes as follows .",
    "our starting point is the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of pt considered in ref .",
    "one may question the validity of that starting point for hadron production .",
    "the support for that position is to be found in the production of photons at the threshold of lasing , which is known to be a second - order pt describable by the gl theory @xcite .",
    "indeed an experiment in quantum optics has accurately verified the prediction in @xcite of the scaling exponent @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable then , in the absence of a workable theory to describe the fluctuations of hadronic observables , to replace photons by hadrons in the gl theory . in the laser problem",
    "the rate of photon emission is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the complex eigenvalue of the annihilation operator that specifies the coherent state @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of detecting @xmath21 photons in time @xmath22 with detector efficiency @xmath23 is then @xmath24 b(\\phi ) \\label{2.2 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is the poisson distribution corresponding to the multiplicities in a pure coherent state @xmath20 . the integration in ( [ 2.2 ] )",
    "is weighted by the probability @xmath26 that the system is in the state @xmath20 .",
    "that probability is given by a boltzmann factor , whose exponent for a homogeneous single - mode laser has exactly the same form as the gl free energy for second - order pt @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we now adapt this formalism for hadron production with the identification @xcite @xmath27 as the hadron density at the spatial coordinate @xmath28 defined in a @xmath29 space .",
    "the poisson distribution is explicitly @xmath30\\quad , \\label{2.4 }        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hadron distribution as a result of pt is @xcite @xmath31\\ , e^{-f \\left [ \\phi \\right]}\\quad , \\label{2.5 }        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32}$ ] , and @xmath33 $ ] is the gl free energy @xmath34 = \\displaystyle \\int_a dz \\left [ a\\left| \\phi(z ) \\right|^2 + b\\left| \\phi(z )   \\right|^4 + c \\left| \\partial \\phi/ \\partial z \\right|^2 \\right ] \\quad .\\label{2.6 }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the gradient term in ( [ 2.6 ] ) is explicitly taken into account in @xcite , it is generally not considered in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the integrations over @xmath28 in ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) are over the area of a bin of size @xmath35 .",
    "thus the fluctuations examined are variations from bin to bin without further details within each bin .",
    "we want to improve on that by use of the ising model .    in the gl theory of ferromagnetism",
    "@xcite the free energy is as given in ( [ 2.6 ] ) with the order parameter @xmath36 being identified as the local mean magnetization field , which in the ising model is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the spin @xmath39 at site @xmath40 .",
    "the sum in ( [ 2.7 ] ) is extended over an area @xmath41 ( surrounding @xmath28 ) smaller than the resolution of the detector , which in our case is the bin size @xmath35 , but large enough to contain many sites .",
    "hereafter , we shall call that area a _ cell _ , having the size @xmath42 , where @xmath43 will be specified below . thus in connecting quark - hadron pt with the ising model , using the laser problem and the gl theory as intermediaries",
    ", we should identify the hadron density ( [ 2.3 ] ) with the absolute square of ( [ 2.7 ] ) so that the hadron multiplicity in the _ i_th cell is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a scale factor that relates the quark density of the plasma at @xmath6 to the lattice site density in the ising model .",
    "@xmath45 relates a physical space to a mathematical space , and there is no way to determine _ a priori _ what that scale factor is .",
    "any observable consequences of our calculation should , of course , be independent of @xmath45 .",
    "a heavyside function has been appended in ( [ 2.8 ] ) for reasons to be explained below .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model without external field is @xmath46 where the sum is over the nearest neighbors . in the simulation of the spin configurations",
    "the net magnetization @xmath47 of the whole lattice of size @xmath48 may be either positive or negative . if @xmath49 , we reverse all spins , replacing @xmath50 by @xmath51 at every site in the lattice , so that we always have @xmath52 , essentially by definition .",
    "we then define hadron multiplicity in a cell by ( [ 2.8 ] ) , in which the @xmath53-function puts @xmath54 , when the net spin in cell @xmath55 is not positive definite .",
    "thus at @xmath16 the disordered state tends to have @xmath56 near zero ; even if @xmath57 for certain cells due to fluctuations , there should be nearly as many cells in a bin that have no hadrons . at @xmath58 the ordered state",
    "has mostly nonempty cells .",
    "these are the characteristics that are physically reasonable , and should be incorporated in the description of the heavy - ion collisions where hadrons are produced from the cylinder surface in patches of fluctuating positions and sizes .",
    "it is an aspect of the hadronization process that can not be addressed in the gl theory .",
    "monte carlo simulation of the ising model by use of the metropolis algorithm suffers greatly from the phenomenon of critical slowing down , when @xmath5 is near @xmath6 @xcite , i.e. the autocorrelation time in generating new configurations becomes very long .",
    "previous numerical work on the study of intermittency in the ising model @xcite must have encountered that difficulty .",
    "we avoid the problem entirely by adopting the wolff algorithm @xcite , with which there is no dependence on the number of steps required to remove autocorrelation .",
    "we work with a 2d lattice of size @xmath59 and consider cells of size @xmath60 .",
    "we use @xmath61 sweeps to set up an initial configuration , and then generate @xmath61 configurations to calculate event averages .",
    "the average hadron multiplicity @xmath62 in a cell in units of @xmath45 is shown as a function of @xmath5 in fig .  1",
    ". the sharp drop occurs at @xmath63 ( in units of @xmath64 ) , a value slightly higher than the analytical value of @xmath6 , 2.27 , for infinite lattice @xcite .",
    "our determination of the precise value of @xmath6 will be given below according to a well - defined procedure . in fig .  1 , @xmath65 approaches 256 as @xmath66 , as it should , since when all spins are aligned , the total - spin squared in a cell is @xmath67 . in the large @xmath5 limit @xmath62",
    "is not zero because not every cell has equal numbers of spin - up and -down .",
    "however , the nonvanishing of @xmath62 is not important for our result , for we shall examine scaling behaviors only in the neighborhood of @xmath6 .",
    "the observable whose scaling properties are to be studied is the normalized factorial moments @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the hadron multiplicity in a bin of size @xmath70 : @xmath71 @xmath56 being the cell multiplicity given in ( [ 2.8 ] ) , the sum being over all @xmath72 cells in a bin , where @xmath73 . in ( [ 3.1 ] ) @xmath74 means ( horizontal ) average over all bins in a configuration , and @xmath75 means ( vertical ) average over all configurations .",
    "the number of bins @xmath76 in the lattice is @xmath77 .",
    "intermittency refers to the scaling in the bin size or in @xmath76 @xmath78 over a range of @xmath76 .",
    "more precisely , we shall refer to it as @xmath76-scaling to be distinguished from @xmath13-scaling , which is the power - law behavior @xmath79 when @xmath76 is varied",
    ". clearly , the validity of ( [ 3.3 ] ) guarantees ( [ 3.4 ] ) , but ( [ 3.4 ] ) may be valid even if ( [ 3.3 ] ) is not .",
    "the latter situation is , in fact , the case in the gl theory @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , there is support for @xmath13-scaling , when the evidence for @xmath76-scaling is weak , from data that have no relevance to quark - hadron pt @xcite .    to determine the @xmath3 moments we generate a spin configuration at a given @xmath5 by the wolff algorithm and calculate the cell multiplicity @xmath56 for a wide range of @xmath45 for all cells in the lattice , which is partitioned into @xmath80 bins . since for any given @xmath45",
    "the bin multiplicity @xmath69 need not be an integer , we take the largest integer less than @xmath69 and use it in ( [ 3.1 ] ) for each bin .",
    "we then perform the horizontal averages in ( [ 3.1 ] ) over all bins in the lattice , followed by averaging over @xmath61 configurations at the same @xmath5 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath45 is shown in fig .  2 for a number of representative values of @xmath82 and @xmath76 .",
    "as expected , there is nearly no dependence on @xmath45 when @xmath45 is large in the interval @xmath83 , since when @xmath69 is large the factorial product @xmath84 is approximately equal to @xmath85 and the @xmath45 factors are canceled in the ratio .",
    "but when @xmath45 is very small , then the effect on @xmath3 is significant .    since the critical point is independent of how we map the quark density to the lattice density , we first set @xmath86 and determine the critical temperature @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the @xmath76 dependence of @xmath81 for @xmath86 at three values of @xmath5 : 2.20 , 2.315 , and 2.40 , always in units of @xmath64 hereafter . it is evident that @xmath76 scaling is good for @xmath87 , but not for the other two temperatures .",
    "the quality of straightness in the log - log plots can be made more transparent by comparing just the @xmath88 moments in the same figure , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . since at @xmath6 clusters of hadronic patches of all sizes are formed , we expect @xmath3 to exhibit @xmath76 scaling at @xmath6 as a characteristics of criticality .",
    "thus we have a criterion for the determination of @xmath6 : @xmath81 should show strict @xmath76 scaling at @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "5 we show the @xmath89 of straightline fits of all @xmath3 @xmath90 for a range of @xmath5 in the neighborhood of small @xmath89 and find that @xmath89 is lowest at @xmath87 , which is therefore the @xmath6 in this problem .    having determined @xmath6",
    ", we now investigate the @xmath45 dependence of @xmath76 scaling . in fig .",
    "6 we show at @xmath6 the @xmath76-scaling behaviors for six values of @xmath45 : 1 , 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.03 , 0.02 , and 0.01 . for each value of @xmath82",
    "the set of curves appear lower for lower values of @xmath45 . clearly , @xmath76 scaling is still good up to @xmath91 100 even for the lowest @xmath45 , but for @xmath92 bends over and even decreases at high @xmath76 and small @xmath45 .",
    "this behavior is reasonable , because at small @xmath45 , the cell multiplicities @xmath56 are small , so the bin multiplicities @xmath69 are also small at high @xmath76 ; thus the factorial product in ( [ 3.1 ] ) vanishes for many cells at high @xmath82 , and @xmath3 receives nonvanishing contribution only from the rare cells and events that have large fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon is not an artifact of the ising model , but is the realistic situation in the data on multiparticle production ( see , for example , the workshop proceedings of @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason our use of the ising model in the way we define hadron multiplicities constitutes a concrete improvement over the previous work on the ising model on the one hand , and over the gl approach to quark - hadron pt on the other .    from fig .",
    "6 we can determine the slopes @xmath93 from the regions where @xmath76 scaling is good . even for @xmath45 = 0.01 , that can be done between @xmath76 = 10 and 100 .",
    "the results for @xmath45 = 1.0 and 0.01 are shown in fig .",
    "evidently , the dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath82 is remarkably linear , which we parameterize as @xmath94 the slopes determined from fig .  7",
    "are 0.135 and 0.121 , respectively , which can be summarized as @xmath95 .",
    "this result should be compared to that of the analytical work of satz on the ising model @xcite , where @xmath96 for @xmath9 .",
    "the agreement is excellent despite the fact that no reference to hadrons is made in @xcite .",
    "this gives us confidence in our procedure of relating quark - hadron pt to the ising model .",
    "the above result is for @xmath97 only .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is no @xmath76 scaling at @xmath98 .",
    "we now show that @xmath13 scaling as defined in ( [ 3.4 ] ) is nevertheless good for a small range of @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , the slope @xmath100 satisfies the formula @xmath101 found in @xcite . but",
    "first , at @xmath6 the validity of ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) implies the validity of ( [ 3.4 ] ) with @xmath102 thus at @xmath97 , we have @xmath103 exactly to the extent that ( [ 14 ] ) is exact .",
    "of course , ( [ 14 ] ) is only a fitted result that is very good , but not exact .",
    "a direct evaluation of @xmath13 scaling can be accomplished by examining @xmath3 vs @xmath104 in log - log plots . in fig .",
    "8 we show those plots for three values of @xmath5 at @xmath86 : ( a ) @xmath105 , ( b ) @xmath106 , and ( c ) @xmath107 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 scaling is good for the first two cases , but not for the third .",
    "hadronization at @xmath108 is only due to fluctuations , and we shall not consider that region any more below . on the other hand , pt can take place at @xmath5 in a small region below @xmath6 , so our @xmath13-scaling analysis takes into account a wider range of hadrons produced in a pt , not just at @xmath6 .",
    "the values of the slopes @xmath109 in fig .  8(a ) and ( b ) are shown by square symbols in fig .",
    "9 as functions of @xmath110 in the log - log plot .",
    "they are well fitted by straight lines , thus verifying the validity of ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "the exponents @xmath4 are found to be 1.068 for @xmath87 , and 1.565 for @xmath105 .",
    "these are the results for @xmath86 .    to see the @xmath45 dependence , we show in fig .",
    "10 the @xmath13-scaling plots for four values of @xmath5 at and below @xmath6 and for various values of @xmath45 .",
    "the range of @xmath45 in which @xmath13-scaling is manifest shrinks as @xmath5 is moved farther away from @xmath6 . for those values of @xmath5 and @xmath45 where straight - line fits can reasonably be made in those figures , the slope parameters @xmath100 are determined .",
    "they all satisfy ( [ 15 ] ) very well . the case for @xmath111",
    "is shown by diamond symbols in fig .",
    "thus @xmath13 scaling , when it exists , can be represented by a value of the scaling exponent @xmath4 , which depends on @xmath5 and @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "11 is shown @xmath112 for various @xmath45 .",
    "when no value of @xmath4 is given , it means that @xmath13-scaling is not good enough to provide unambiguous extraction of @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath86 the range of @xmath5 where @xmath4 can be determined is largest .",
    "11 shows that @xmath4 increases from 1.07 at @xmath6 to 1.67 at @xmath113 .",
    "but for @xmath114 only at @xmath6 can @xmath4 be determined to be 1.02 .",
    "the result at @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath115 , differs slightly from the earlier result of @xmath103 that follows from ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "they are close enough to be compatible , considering the fact that both procedures involve fitting of approximate scaling curves in different variables .",
    "the physical situation corresponds to low values of @xmath45 , since the hadron multiplicities in a cell should not be too large . taking only @xmath114 and @xmath116",
    ", we show the corresponding values of @xmath4 in fig .  12 .",
    "the variation is between @xmath117 and @xmath118 over a narrow range of @xmath5 below @xmath6 .",
    "it straddles very well the value @xmath17 ( dashed line ) determined in the gl theory @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the gl calculation there is no dependence of @xmath4 on the gl parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( so long as @xmath14 ) and on the dimension @xmath121 .",
    "it is an average result that is situated in the middle of the range of @xmath122 that we have now determined with the spatial fluctuations taken into account .",
    "the two results therefore give mutual support to each other .",
    "we have varied the cell size by reducing @xmath43 from 4 to 3 .",
    "all the results are found to be virtually unchanged .",
    "indeed , a sensitive dependence of @xmath43 would render our procedure of determining the scaling behavior of particle production unreliable and physically irrelevant .",
    "since @xmath5 is not subject to experimental control in heavy - ion collisions , we have no way to check the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath122 empirically .",
    "detected hadrons , even in a small @xmath15 interval may be created in a range of @xmath5 below @xmath6 , so the observation of @xmath123 for all hadrons emitted would be a confirmation of both the gl and ising descriptions of pt .",
    "our study here not only generalizes the pt problem to allow for spatial fluctuations of hadronization patches , but also demonstrates that smaller @xmath4 means larger fluctuation , since it is known that the fluctuation is greatest at @xmath6 .",
    "before going into @xmath2 , let us first review what we have learned so far .",
    "we have been trying to relate three physical processes and models : ( a ) quark - hadron pt , ( b ) gl theory of pt , and ( c ) ising model in @xmath1 . from ( b ) is derived in @xcite the scaling behavior of @xmath3 , which is the measure appropriate for ( a ) ; however , being a mean - field theory ( b ) is too smooth to reveal spatial fluctuations of ( a ) . since the physical dimension for the pt is @xmath1 , ( c )",
    "is used to examine the scaling behavior where the discreteness of the hadron multiplicity in a cell is emphasized .",
    "the result affirms the @xmath13-scaling behavior found in ( b ) , but with the scaling exponent @xmath4 dependent on @xmath5 , which is not a feature of ( b ) . at @xmath6",
    "the value of @xmath4 agrees with what can be inferred from the analytic treatment of 2d ising model @xcite , but when averaged over a small range of @xmath7 , it agrees with the analytic result derived on the basis of ( b ) .",
    "thus the disagreement between the original , strict results of ( b ) and ( c ) ( i.e. , @xmath124 and 1.0 , respectively ) is removed by our present treatment of hadron formation in the context of ( a ) . however , there is a level of understanding still unattained thus far . in carrying out our calculation",
    "we have used the definition of hadrons on the lattice as described in sec .  2 at the same time when the 2d ising model is used to simulate second - order pt .",
    "the question then arises as to which one of these two aspects of the problem is more responsible for the result of the previous section , i.e. , our way of counting hadrons or the two - dimensionality of the space . to answer this question",
    "we perform a similar calculation using the hadron definition of sec .  2 , but in the @xmath2 ising model , which is known to have critical indices in agreement with the gl theory .",
    "in so doing we can learn whether the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath4 is a result of discrete hadron counting ( as would be the case if the behavior persists in @xmath2 ) or of the two - dimensionality ( if the behavior disappears in @xmath2 ) .    in @xmath2 we must be content with smaller lattice size . we have used @xmath125 in each dimension , and considered a cell as being of volume @xmath126 , with @xmath127 .",
    "thus a cell has @xmath128 sites , as in the case of @xmath1 where @xmath129 .",
    "our bins of lattice volume @xmath130 can contain @xmath131 cells , which can vary from @xmath132 to @xmath133 cells .",
    "as before , we use ( 8) to define the hadron multiplicity on the 4d lattice , except , of course , that the sum is over @xmath134 , all sites of a 4d cell at @xmath55 . since a 4d lattice is far from the reality of a quark - gluon system , there is no precise meaning to the value of @xmath56 calculated by ( 8) , apart from the physical interpretation that it plays the role of multiplicity in 4d .",
    "the scale factor @xmath45 should , nevertheless , be present as in the 2d case to make the present calculation as close to the previous one as possible , so @xmath45 can be varied over the same range . as in 2d , we would not want to think that a cell can contain as many as @xmath135 particles .",
    "we continue to use ( 9 ) as the hamiltonian , but in 4d , and to employ the wolff algorithm for simulation .",
    "since we have been unable to find in the literature an analytical determination of @xmath6 for the 4d ising model , we have to search for the critical point without any guidance except by the procedure used in the previous section .    in fig .",
    "13 we show the average cell multiplicity in units of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "it is the result of averaging over @xmath136 configurations after initial runs of @xmath136 sweeps . evidently , the transition temperature is not as distinct as in fig.1 for @xmath1 . to determine @xmath6",
    "precisely we have attempted to find the temperature at which there is @xmath76 scaling as in fig .",
    "since @xmath6 is independent of @xmath45 , we set @xmath137 during the search .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to find any @xmath5 at which @xmath3 exhibits strict power - law behavior in @xmath76 , which is now @xmath138 .",
    "perhaps it is because in 4d the value of @xmath139 at @xmath140 is not large enough to allow the full manifestation of long - range correlation .",
    "14 is an example of the @xmath76 dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "that figure is actually for @xmath97 , the value of which is to be determined later . at neighboring values of @xmath5 the behaviors of @xmath3 vs @xmath76 are similar , so we omit their presentation .    for any set of @xmath3 at a given @xmath5 we can plot @xmath3 vs @xmath104 .",
    "15 shows such a plot for the @xmath3 in fig .  14 . fitting all such plots by the @xmath13-scaling formula ( 13 )",
    "we can determine the scaling exponent @xmath4 .",
    "15 shows the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 . remarkably there is a dip at @xmath141 .",
    "mindful of a similar dip in fig .",
    "11 , we declare the critical point to be at @xmath142 . in the absence of any other method that we can apply for a precise determination of @xmath6 ,",
    "the dip in @xmath122 emerges as the only feasible method . knowing @xmath6 allows us to focus on the behavior of the scaling exponent in its neighborhood .    returning to fig .  14 we can examine the @xmath76 dependences for various values of @xmath45 at @xmath6 .",
    "note that there is essentially no difference between @xmath143 and @xmath144 , just as it is in fig .",
    "6 for @xmath1 .",
    "but for @xmath145 all @xmath3 fall below @xmath146 for @xmath147 and are not plotted in fig .  14 . for the range of @xmath76 shown for @xmath145 , which corresponds to @xmath148 , the dotted lines almost show @xmath76 scaling . in the @xmath13-scaling plot of fig .",
    "15 , there appears to be no dependence on @xmath45 for @xmath149 up to the second highest values for @xmath3 .",
    "the last and highest points for log@xmath150 are for @xmath151 and for @xmath152 and @xmath144 only .",
    "the large gap from the second highest ones @xmath153 can not be reduced because the bin size must jump discretely from two cells to one in each dimension .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are determined by straight - line fits of the portion of fig .",
    "15 corresponding to @xmath154 , i.e. , excluding the highest points .",
    "the result on @xmath112 , shown in fig .",
    "16 , exhibits some @xmath45 dependence at @xmath6 . for the case",
    "@xmath145 , which is perhaps closest to the physical problem with the lowest @xmath155 per cell , we have @xmath156 , in agreement with the result in gl theory @xcite .",
    "that is gratifying , since this is our only way of checking that the scaling behaviors of 4d ising model and of the gl theory agree .",
    "the fact that @xmath4 is distinctly different from @xmath157 implies that the scaling exponent is not universal . as in the 2d case ,",
    "@xmath13 scaling is valid only within a very small range of @xmath5 around @xmath6 , when @xmath145 .",
    "when @xmath158 , we can investigate the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath112 .",
    "fig.16 shows that @xmath112 increases as @xmath5 decreases from @xmath6 , exhibiting essentially the same features as in fig .",
    "this result answers the question we have asked toward the end of the first paragraph of this section .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath159 is independent of the dimension @xmath121 .",
    "since the analytic result from the gl theory is that @xmath160 independent of @xmath5 @xcite , we now see that the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath112 is a consequence of the spatial fluctuations , which have been simulated on the lattice , but are lacking in the gl theory , and has little to do with the dimension of the system .",
    "by working with the ising model we have learned a number of things about second - order pt that are relevant to the quark - hadron problem .",
    "first of all , because the physical system of interest is two dimensional , it is the result of the 2d ising model that we should concentrate on . using the definition of hadrons on the lattice that we have constructed on the basis that hadron density is related to the square of the order parameter ( or the total magnetization in a cell ) , we have been able to introduce spatial fluctuations during the hadronization process , a feature that is missing in the gl description . in so doing we are faced with a dilemma that the result of our simulation resolves .",
    "the dilemma is that the scaling behavior of 2d ising model is known from analytical studies @xcite to imply @xmath161 , whereas the gl theory yields the analytical result of @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "the resolution is that when discrete hadron counting is achieved by lattice simulation , a temperature dependence is introduced into @xmath122 . at @xmath97",
    ", @xmath162 is indeed approximately @xmath157 , but at @xmath7 , @xmath122 is larger .",
    "the average is approximately @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "12 . in the gl theory",
    "@xmath4 is independent of @xmath5 so long as @xmath7 , so its result @xmath124 may be regarded as an average over @xmath5 in agreement with our simulated result . in the physical problem of quark - hadron pt in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the hadronization temperature is not measurable .",
    "the observed hadron multiplicity fluctuations may well reflect hadronization occurring at a range of @xmath7 .",
    "thus the average @xmath124 is still the relevant scaling exponent in phenomenology .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath122 is not a special feature of @xmath1 . by simulating in @xmath2",
    "we have found essentially the same @xmath5 dependence .",
    "moreover , at @xmath6 in 4d the value of @xmath163 is approximately @xmath8 rather than @xmath157 , reconfirming the known fact that the gl theory and the ising model agree at @xmath2 or higher .",
    "this gives us confidence in our choice of definition of hadron multiplicity in the ising model and in the physical implications of the results obtained by simulation in 2d .",
    "the basic understanding we have learned is that when the shortcoming of the gl theory is amended by taking into account the spatial fluctuations of hadronization , the predicted result of @xmath124 is unchanged , except for the realization that it is a mean value after averaging over a range of @xmath5 below @xmath6 .",
    "it is also important to recognize at a more general level that in our attempt to relate quark - hadron physics to statistical physics we have found the effectiveness of using the factorial moments @xmath3 , the significance of @xmath13-scaling , and the amazing validity of @xmath164 in all circumstances , with the consequence that the scaling exponent @xmath4 has emerged as an effective parameter characteristic of pt , in lieu of the usual critical indices that rely on @xmath5 being under experimental control .",
    "it is therefore suggestive that our method of describing the properties of pt may find applications in other areas of science where discrete multiplicities are the only observables at one s disposal .",
    "such an application has recently been found in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
