    "the @xmath8-classically correlated states take in general the form @xmath116 with @xmath11 denoting an orthonormal basis for subsystem @xmath8 .    to prove that @xmath8-classically correlated states have vanishing lqu @xmath117 , it is sufficient to define the observable @xmath118 where @xmath119 is diagonal in the basis defined by @xmath120 , to obtain @xmath121=0 $ ] which means @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",
    "a vanishing lqu ensures the existence of a local observable @xmath123 such that @xmath124 .",
    "hence @xmath125 commutes with the density matrix , and we can diagonalize them simultaneously . since the observable is assumed nondegenerate , its eigenvectors define a _ unique _ basis on @xmath8 ( up to phases ) , say @xmath126 . then , an eigenvector basis for @xmath127 will be simply @xmath128 , and the state must necessarily be of the form @xmath129 , which is a zero discord state .",
    "this proves that @xmath130 vanishes if and only if @xmath9 is an @xmath8-classically correlated state .",

    "consequently , the lqu inherits this property .",
    "denoting as @xmath127 the most certain observable for @xmath9 , we have @xmath140 .",
    "finally , for pure states @xmath141 , the lqu reduces to the variance of @xmath135 minimized over all local observables @xmath135 . in the next section we present a proof ( which can be of independent interest ) that such a quantity decreases monotonically under local operations and classical communication , so that the lqu , alias minimal local variance , reduces to an entanglement measure on pure states .",
    "+      [ permutanda ] consider a @xmath142-dimensional density matrix @xmath9 , and the set @xmath143 of all observables with fixed spectrum @xmath144 .",

    "an observable in the considered set can the be written as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is a unitary transformation .",
    "the variance of @xmath12 on the state @xmath9 reads ( @xmath150 ) @xmath151 ^ 2\\qquad p_{ij}\\equiv p_i\\lambda_j^2,\\;q_{ij}\\equiv p_i\\lambda_j,\\;b_{ij}\\equiv|v_{ij}|^2.\\label{boh}\\ ] ] note that @xmath26 is a unistochastic matrix , and in fact , any unistochastic matrix is expressible as @xmath152 for some unitary @xmath149 .",

    "the two operators clearly yield the same variance , since the labels @xmath191 do not affect its calculation .",
    "note that it is always possible to pick @xmath135 in the above form since the operators on @xmath8 restricted to a @xmath183-dimensional subspace can assume the same form as any operator in @xmath182 .",

    "<S> we assess whether and how quantum correlations in the ( generally mixed ) state @xmath9 play a role in determining the sensitivity of the estimation . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the remaining steps of the estimation process are assumed to be noiseless ( the unknown transformation @xmath78 is unitary and the output measurement is the ideal one defined above ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation stems from the relation between the wigner - yanase and the fisher metrics @xcite , which implies that the skew information of the hamiltonian is majorized by the qfi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath69 is not necessarily the most certain local observable with spectrum @xmath79 , the @xmath79-lqu itself fixes a lower bound to the qfi : @xmath80 then , for probe states with any nonzero amount of discord , and for @xmath81 repetitions of the experiment , the optimal detection strategy which asymptotically saturates the quantum cramr - rao bound produces an estimator @xmath63 with necessarily limited variance , scaling as @xmath82 hence , we established on rigorous footings that the quantum correlations measured by lqu , though not necessary @xcite , are a sufficient resource to ensure a guaranteed upper bound on the smallest possible variance with which a phase @xmath60 can be measured with mixed probes .    </S>",
    "<S> we now provide a simple example to clarify the above general discussion . </S>",
    "<S> suppose system @xmath8 is a spin-@xmath83 particle undergoing a phase rotation @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the third spin component , and @xmath60 the phase to be estimated . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the estimation precision is bounded by the so - called _ heisenberg limit _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . a typical scheme achieving this limit </S>",
    "<S> can be outlined as follows . </S>",
    "<S> assume that system @xmath26 is simply a qubit with states @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath59 system is initially prepared in the product state @xmath88 , where @xmath89 are the eigenstates of @xmath85 with eigenvalues @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> then , a ` control - flip ' operation @xmath92 is applied , so that the system evolves to @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the entangled state @xmath94 used as a probe achieves the heisenberg limit . </S>",
    "<S> our general treatment allows us to study quantitatively the effect of noise on the estimation power of the bipartite state @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose now that the probe state , ideally @xmath94 , is prepared in a noisy environment , which induces partial dephasing in the basis @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> then , our probe state is in general given by @xmath95,$ ] where @xmath96 quantifies the degree of residual coherence , and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> as this is effectively a @xmath98-qubit state , we can restrict our analysis to a truncated @xmath99 hilbert space . here </S>",
    "<S> the restriction of @xmath85 has the spectrum @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus calculate the @xmath70-lqu in this effective @xmath99 hilbert space , obtaining @xmath101 . for any @xmath83 , notice that the discord is a monotonically increasing function of the coherence @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ premestruo ] ) one has @xmath103 as the spin number @xmath83 is increasing , this guarantees that the classical scaling @xmath104 ( i.e. the so - called _ shot noise limit _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) can still be beaten provided that @xmath105 .    the connection between the lqu and the sensitivity of parameter estimation </S>",
    "<S> can also be appreciated in more abstract geometrical terms , without the need for invoking the fisher information . as shown by brody @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the skew information @xmath106 of the hamiltonian @xmath69 determines the squared speed of evolution of the density matrix @xmath9 under the unitary @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides another geometric interpretation for the lqu : the observable @xmath38 which achieves the minimum in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lqu ] is the local observable with the property that the resulting local unitary operation @xmath107 makes the given state @xmath9 of the whole system evolve as slowly as possible ( the observable @xmath38 is the least disturbing in this specific sense ) . since a higher speed of state evolution under a change in the parameter @xmath60 means a higher sensitivity of the given probe state to the estimation of the parameter , our result can be interpreted as follows : the amount of discord ( lqu ) in a mixed correlated probe state @xmath9 used for estimation of a parameter @xmath60 bounds from below the squared speed of evolution of the state under any local hamiltonian evolution @xmath108 , hence the sensitivity of the given probe state @xmath9 to a variation of @xmath60 , which is a general measure of precision for the considered metrological task .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._ in this letter we studied the quantum uncertainty on single observables . </S>",
    "<S> the exploration of this concept allowed us to define and investigate a class of measures of bipartite quantum correlations of the discord type @xcite , which are physically insightful and mathematically rigorous . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for qubit - qudit states a unique measure is defined ( up to normalization ) , and it is computable in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> quantum correlations , in the form known as quantum discord @xcite , manifest in the fact that any single local observable displays an intrinsic quantum uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> discord in mixed probe states , measured by the local quantum uncertainty , is further proven to guarantee a minimum sensitivity in the protocol of optimal phase estimation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believe worthwhile to substantiate in future work the promising uncovered connections between quantum mechanics , information geometry and complexity science @xcite by addressing the role of quantum uncertainty , in particular induced by quantum correlations , in such contexts . + _ note added in proof . </S>",
