    "the evolutionary prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) has attracted substantial attention over the past few decades  @xcite . in this game , two agents must simultaneously select one of two strategies : cooperation or defection .",
    "the prisoners receive payoffs that are dependent on their choices",
    ". a selfish agent will adapt their strategy to maximize their payoff .",
    "game theory involves the construction of many types of models and analysis of these models using varied parameters .",
    "therefore , game theory serves as a powerful metaphore for simulation of the interactions between individuals in many domains , including biology , economy , and ecology .    in the pdg",
    ", mutual cooperation generates the highest return for the community .",
    "however , the nash equilibrium state is mutual defection because defection is a better choice for the prisoner , regardless of the strategy of the other prisoner .",
    "importantly , in the real world , mutual cooperation is the most commonly utilized strategy .",
    "systems such as the pdg are considered to be an important tool for study the emergence of cooperative behavior between selfish individuals  @xcite .",
    "nowak and may  @xcite introduced a spatial prisoner s dilemma game ( spdg ) consisting of a two - state cellular automaton . in the general spdg ,",
    "the agents in the game play the pdg with their network neighbors and get payoffs according to a payoff matrix .",
    "the total payoff of each agent is the sum of all payoffs in this step .",
    "an agent may then mimic his neighbor s strategy by comparing his payoffs in this step with his neighbor s payoffs .",
    "an important conclusion is that spatial structure can promote the persistence of cooperation .",
    "because the interactions of an agent are limited to his local neighbors , pdg models have been extensively explored in the past few years  @xcite .",
    "in addition to spatial structure , there are several mechanisms that may facilitate the emergence and persistence of cooperation among populations .",
    "hamilton found that kin selection can favor cooperation  @xcite .",
    "axelrod s model demonstrated that the  _ tit for tat _ strategy could sustain cooperation in systems of all players playing the game together .",
    "the simulation performed by szab , vukov , and szolnoki provided evidence that noise and irrational choices affect the maintenance of cooperative behavior  @xcite .    in the traditional spdg model ,",
    "the changing probability of strategy is determined by the agents performance on one step . in other words",
    ", people assume that the agents are shortsighted and forgetful .",
    "in fact , when people make an important decision , they generally consider the current situation and their experiences .",
    "therefore , the effect of memory should be taken into account .",
    "historical memory plays a key role in the evolutionary game  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to evaluate whether memory enhances the density of cooperators and detracts the cooperators from the temptation .",
    "we observed the maximum value of critical points from a homogeneous cooperator to a mixed state of cooperator and defector .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an evolutionary spdg with the memory effect in a square lattice , in which players update their strategy by considering previous payoffs .",
    "the rules of the game are explained in section ii .",
    "the simulations , which are detailed in section iii , show that the evolution of spdg depends on the magnitude of the memory effect and payoff - matrix elements .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "in the traditional pdg , there are two players .",
    "each player choses one of two strategies : _ cooperator _ ( @xmath0 ) or _ defector _ ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "there are four combinations for the two players : ( @xmath0 , @xmath0 ) , ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 ) , and ( @xmath1 , @xmath1 ) , which corresponded to payoffs ( @xmath2 , @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , ( @xmath4 , @xmath3 ) , and ( @xmath5 , @xmath5 ) . the rewards or punishments for each player can be tabulated as @xmath6 payoff matrices ( see table [ table-1 ] ) .",
    ".the payoff matrix of prisoner s dilemma game . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table-1 ]    four elements in the payoff matrix satisfy the order ranking @xmath7 and the additional constraint @xmath8 for repeated interactions .",

    "our study is based on systematic monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on a square lattice network with periodic boundary conditions .",
