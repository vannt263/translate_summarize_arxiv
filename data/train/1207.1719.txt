    "we find that following a different protocol , the window function still describes two pulses of opposite signs propagating in the same direction .",

    "after the two pulses have separated due to their different velocities , the fractionalized charges on the two edge channels can be obtained from @xmath124 for the charge pulse and from @xmath125 for the neutral pulse . in the former , a charge @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 parametrizes the strength of interactions ) travels in channel 2 and @xmath126 in channel 1 . in the neutral pulse ,",
