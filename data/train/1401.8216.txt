    "the interaction of mesons with opposite charm to give hidden charm heavy mesons is capturing much attention recently .",
    "indeed , the large number of x , y , z states being reported experimentally @xcite are finding difficulties to be fitted in the ordinary order of standard charmonium states @xcite and call for more complex structures .",
    "the molecular picture of states coming from the interaction of @xmath14 or @xmath15 has been one of the sources to interpret some of these states , and different combinations of such mesons giving hidden charm mesons have been considered . in this sense , a bound state of @xmath16",
    "was theoretically found in @xcite and tentatively called x(3700 ) .",
    "other works have also reported on this possibility @xcite .",
    "subsequently , experimental support for such a state was found in @xcite from a bump close to the threshold of the @xmath16 invariant mass distribution in the @xmath17 reaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 interaction has also been studied @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an extension of the interaction from the local hidden gauge approach @xcite was used and several states in different spin - isospin channels were found , some of which could be associated to known x , y , z states .",
    "the isospin @xmath1 states are more difficult to obtain within this approach since the interaction is weaker in this channel .",
    "even then , a state with @xmath1 and @xmath19 was found in @xcite , prior to the reports of the @xmath1 @xmath20 @xcite found in the @xmath21 reaction looking at the invariant mass of @xmath22 , or the claimed @xmath23 from a peak in the @xmath24 spectrum close to threshold @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this peak as a @xmath25 new state with mass 4025 mev has been scrutinized in @xcite where it was found that the peak seen was compatible with a @xmath26 state with mass around 3990 mev and a width around 160 mev .",
    "subsequently , the analysis of @xcite has been revised in @xcite in the light of the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) and it was found that the binding is smaller than found in @xcite , compatible with the mass suggested in @xcite and with a similar width .",
    "the @xmath0 systems have been the most studied , stimulated by the large impact that the x(3872 ) state @xcite has had in this field @xcite . much at the origin , this state was assumed to be a @xmath27 @xcite , however , subsequent works have stressed the relevance of considering the charged component @xmath28 forming a quite good isospin i=0 state @xcite .",
    "more recently , the radiative decay of the x(3872 ) into @xmath29 has shown that the charged components are essential to obtain the right rates @xcite .",
    "once again , it was surprising to find @xmath1 states , since the interaction in this channel is weaker than for i=0 . yet , experimental work has been conducted recently and the besiii collaboration has reported a state @xmath11 from the invariant mass of @xmath5 in the @xmath30 reaction @xcite , with a width of @xmath31 mev .",
    "the belle collaboration has reconfirmed the finding and , using different energies for the electron beam , a peak is also seen in @xmath5 around 3894 mev and a width of about @xmath32 mev @xcite .",
    "cleo has followed with more precision and reported a peak at 3886 mev and a width of @xmath33 mev @xcite .",
    "the state observed has @xmath1 and @xmath25 .",
    "theoretical work has followed : in @xcite a discussion is made on possible structures of this state and suggestions of new experiments are made to get a further insight on its nature .",
    "a @xmath0 molecular structure is suggested in @xcite .",
    "work has also been done using qcd sum rules , suggesting a tetraquark structure . in particular , in @xcite a tetraquark interpolating current was used in order to estimate the decay width of the @xmath11 , while in @xcite the same tetraquark current is used to estimate the mass .    in the present work we use an extrapolation of the chiral symmetry approach for the pseudoscalar - vector interaction used in @xcite .",
    "this approach was extrapolated to the charm sector in @xcite , where several axial vector states were obtained from the interaction , among them the x(3872 ) . yet , in @xcite no states in @xmath1 for @xmath0 were found , the interaction being weaker in this channel than in i=0 .",
    "meanwhile , several works have shown the relevance of heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) in dealing with the interaction of heavy mesons and how the dynamics of the local hidden gauge approach provides a natural extension of chiral symmetry to the heavy sector , since it respects the rules of hqss for the dominant terms that come from the exchange of light vectors @xcite .",
    "further clarifying is the work of @xcite , where the impulse approximation is used at the quark level to provide an easy interpretation of the hqss , showing then how to extrapolate the local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector .",
    "all these ideas have been put together in @xcite to study the @xmath18 interaction in @xmath1 . in that work",
    "it is shown how the exchange of a light @xmath2 is ozi forbidden in @xmath1 , which makes the combined exchange of the su(3 ) nonet of pseudoscalar cancel in the limit of equal masses , and the exchange of @xmath34 also cancel . as a consequence",
    ", only the @xmath35 exchange is allowed in the case of @xmath1 , plus the simultaneous two pion exchange , which was evaluated in @xcite but found weaker than the exchange of the vector meson . in spite of the large mass of the @xmath35 , which suppresses the propagator in the @xmath35 exchange ,",
    "it was found in @xcite that the interaction could bind the @xmath18 system weakly and at the same time provide an explanation for the experimental peak in the @xmath18 mass distribution from where the @xmath23 was claimed @xcite .",
    "one reason why a weak state not seen before is now obtained has to be found in the improvements on the interaction in the light of hqss and on the extended range of the momenta allowed in the intermediate states , since the small mass of the light vectors restricts the momenta in the loops to a much larger extent than the exchange of heavy vectors .",
    "another aspect that one should take into consideration is the fact that , similarly to the case of the claimed @xmath23 from the peak in the invariant mass of the @xmath24 close to threshold , in this case there is also another reaction , @xmath6 measured at besiii @xcite , where the peak in the @xmath8 invariant mass is interpreted in terms of a new @xmath25 resonance with mass around 3885 mev and width @xmath36 mev .",
    "it is unclear whether this state is the same as the one claimed in besiii @xcite , or belle @xcite or cleo @xcite . in view of the present situation",
    "we combine in this paper the two lines of work in @xcite and @xcite and perform a theoretical study of the @xmath0 interaction with the extended hidden gauge approach . after this",
    ", we perform an empirical analysis of the data from the @xmath6 reaction and see if they can be interpreted in terms of the theoretically found resonance . the answer to",
    "the question is yes and we propose to interpret the data in terms of a resonance @xmath37 with a mass around @xmath9 mev and a width around @xmath10 mev , coming from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 decay channels .    in this work we study the @xmath3 system taking into account the possible sources of interaction in order to compare them and identify the most relevant process .",
    "we start analysing the contribution coming from the exchange of heavy vectors , proceeding then to the evaluation of the exchange of one light pseudoscalar ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , followed by the exchange of two correlated and also uncorrelated pions .",
    "we find the last three processes very small compared to the heavy vector exchange , which , as in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , is found to be the leading source of interaction and , even if small , it is enough to bind the system .",
    "we want to study states of @xmath1 eventually generated by the @xmath3 interaction . to do this , we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from the observation that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ozi ] , the exchange of a light meson is ozi forbidden , since a @xmath41 state exchange is forced to be converted into a @xmath42 state .",
    "this means that the contributions coming from @xmath43 and @xmath44 exchange cancel when taking equal masses and the same happens in the case of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath45 mesons if equal masses are taken , or for large momenta bigger than the mass of the mesons .",
    "a @xmath41 from the upper vertex is forced to convert into a @xmath46 pair in the lower one , evidencing an ozi forbidden mechanism . ]",
    "thus , we evaluate the heavy vector exchange , where the ozi restriction no longer holds .",
    "we want to study the interaction between pseudoscalar mesons and vectors in the charm sector .",
    "in particular , we are interested in possible states with quantum numbers @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath1 .    in this sector",

    "however , we will only take into account the last three : since we are investigating the energy region around @xmath58 mev , the @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels , whose thresholds are at much smaller energies , will only slightly affect the results . for negative @xmath49-parity ( @xmath59 , we will only account for the @xmath60 channel , since the @xmath61 and @xmath62 are too far from the energy values we are interested in .    in order to study the @xmath63 interaction , we use the hidden gauge symmetry",

    ", we have used an extension of local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector to study the interaction of @xmath3 and @xmath288 , together with coupled channels with a pseudoscalar and a vector meson .",
    "the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry show that the terms which are dominant in other processes , like in @xmath289 , due to the exchange of light mesons , are now forbidden . hence , one resorts to sub - dominant terms that come from the exchange of heavy vectors , or the exchange of two pions .",
    "we find that the exchange of two pions is quite small in comparison with the exchange of heavy vectors and its effect is included in the uncertainties of the results .",
    "we find a state with a mass of @xmath290 mev and a width around @xmath275 mev with @xmath1 and positive @xmath291parity .",
    "this state , in our formalism , is an isospin partner of the @xmath292 .",
    "the second part of the work consists in a reanalysis of the experiment of @xcite in the @xmath293 reaction .",

    "we performed a reanalysis of the data and found a solution close by , with @xmath295 mev and @xmath296 mev preferably .",
    "hence , the present study shows that the data of @xcite are compatible with a slightly lower mass , as obtained theoretically in the present paper .",
    "thus , the results reported here offer a natural explanation of the state claimed in @xcite , in terms of a @xmath297 weakly bound state that decays into the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels .",
    "the question remains whether that state reconfirmed in this paper would be the same as the @xmath11 claimed by besiii in @xcite , or the @xmath298 reported by belle @xcite , or the @xmath299 reported by cleo in @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties in the masses and widths in all these experiments , it is quite likely that these experiments are seeing the same state , although other options can not be ruled out at the present time . in any case",
    ", we can say that , given the fact that a single channel @xmath3 with an energy independent potential can not produce a resonance above the threshold at @xmath300 mev @xcite , a state with @xmath58 mev could not be easily interpreted as a @xmath297 molecular state , while the one at lower energy stands naturally for a molecular interpretation , as we have reported here .",
    "further precise measurements and investigations of other decay channels will help shed light on this issue in the future , and they should be encouraged .",
