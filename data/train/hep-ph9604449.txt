    "in earlier work @xcite we used a supermultiplet theory uniting the vector and pseudoscalar mesons to attempt to obtain a universal three ",
    "point coupling constant .",
    "the relativistic multispinor fields of the supermultiplet theory described pointlike mesons with correct spin , parity , flavor and color degrees of freedom without necessarily invoking the notion of constituent quarks . despite the apparent contradiction with the modern understanding of the quark nature of mesons",
    "it has been shown @xcite that such a field is dynamically equivalent to a system of two quarks moving at equal velocity and on  shell .",
    "this relatively simple scheme does nonetheless compare favorably with experimental results for strong vector and pseudoscalar interactions in the light and heavy meson sector .",
    "when we include the radiative decays by incorporating vector meson dominance with the scheme we once again found reasonable agreement , but there were some unexpected and significant deviations from the theory , particularly in the @xmath4 decays .",
    "the supermultiplet theory and exact su(3 ) predict the coupling ratio @xmath5 to equal 2 . but",
    "experimental measurement currently estimates the ratio as @xmath6 , a substantial difference .",
    "one possible reason why the supermultiplet scheme did not comply with the experimental measure is that the exact form of the vector meson dominance is not known in the @xmath7 limit ; it is only accurately known for @xmath8 from @xmath9 decays .",
    "hence there is some uncertainty in extrapolating vector meson dominance to the off  shell case .",
    "however , the difference in theory and experiment is so large that it is unlikely this is the only contributing factor .",
    "thus we also implemented some symmetry breaking in the supermultiplet scheme , but the @xmath10 radiative decays seemed impervious to our attempts at matching theory with experiment as large discrepancies remained .    to understand these deviations further",
    ", we sought a method which easily allowed for off  shell propagation of the quarks so that we could evaluate the magnitude of this necessary correction . a convenient and apparently successful method for doing",
    "this was by use of a quark triangle diagram ; which so far has given accurate predictions for @xmath11 decay widths @xcite and pion and kaon charge radii @xcite .",
    "a form which used chiral and isospin symmetry has also been successfully applied to the @xmath10 radiative decay problem and some radiative decays in the light meson sector @xcite .",
    "the resulting loop integral accounted for the difference in quark masses and hence propagators in the loop , and correspondence between theory and experiment was achieved .",
    "nonetheless , a crucial assumption of the quark triangle diagram is that the meson  quark ",
    "antiquark vertex has the form @xmath12 for the pseudoscalar meson and @xmath13 for the vector meson . if we are to confidently use the quark triangle method we wish to test the appropriateness of this assumption .",
    "we do this by extracting the couplings from experimental measurements and examine the extent to which they carry the spin and flavor symmetries . with this in mind , we firstly formulate the limit free form of the integral and derive a limiting case which uses chiral symmetry .",
    "this enables us to compare our result with others .",
    "we also determine a heavy quark expansion . following this ,",
    "the scheme is applied to @xmath1 decays which yield estimates of @xmath3 and then to @xmath0 decays to obtain the product @xmath14 for different quark flavors .",
    "the results indicate that the meson ",
    "antiquark couplings in the @xmath15 sector determined from different channels which involve common constituent quarks are remarkably uniform , suggesting that the effective vertex in the quark triangle diagram is valid .",
    "the data also demonstrates that the triangle method should be highly predictive due to the stability of the couplings .",
    "finally we use the method in the heavy meson sector , to predict coupling ratios of the form @xmath16 where the only free parameters required are the constituent quark masses .",
    "our result for @xmath17 decays fall within other theoretical estimates , while that of @xmath18 is sensitive to @xmath19 quark mass .",
    "in the quark triangle formulation of figure  [ fig : qtri ] , the decay from vector meson to pseudoscalar meson and photon state is mediated by a quark loop with flavors of constituent mass @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "( the choice of constituent mass rather than current mass is supported @xcite ) .",

    "also we remain cautious of predictions involving the @xmath175 meson due to its association with the u(1 ) anomaly .",
    "since our @xmath27 is approximation free ( i.e.  no chiral limit assumptions ) we can safely use it in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 meson cases .",

    "the results appear in figures  [ fig : dratio ] and [ fig : bratio ] . in order to give actual values",
    "we use a @xmath129 quark mass of 1550 mev ( approximately half the @xmath252 mass ) yielding @xmath253 and a @xmath19 quark mass of 4730 mev ( approximately half the @xmath254 mass ) which gives @xmath255 .",
    "we can compare our results with those of other workers .",
    "these are presented in table  [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "we hoped that our study of @xmath256 measurements would enable us to make some reasonable guesses of @xmath257 and @xmath258 , but the data does not allow this .",
    "thus we can not make predictions about actual decay widths .",
    "we have successfully evaluated @xmath67 and @xmath130 processes in a quark triangle diagram scheme which is valid for arbitrary vector or pseudoscalar masses . by comparison with available experimental data",
    ", we found that this scheme works well for all radiative processes involving the light mesons ( no charm or bottom quarks ) , except for @xmath259 ( due to the sensitivity of this channel to the mixing angle ) and @xmath260 .",
    "the scheme produces well determined estimates of the meson  quark ",
    "antiquark couplings for the light mesons .",
    "the large difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates a substantial violation of spin symmetry in the quark triangle formalism .",
    "we also observed a relatively weak su(3 ) chiral symmetry breaking due to the finite masses of the goldstone  type pseudoscalar mesons , along with a more apparent su@xmath219 symmetry breakdown arising from the difference in light constituent quark masses .",
    "we note that these coupling constants are relatively insensitive to the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "a number of predictions have been made based on the scheme .",
    "firstly we note that our theoretical result for the @xmath234 decay width is around the present experimental upper limit and awaits comparison with further measurement .",
    "secondly our prediction for @xmath261 with @xmath262 is within range of other theoretical estimates , while @xmath263 for @xmath264 is small compared with the few results in the literature .",
    "we expect future measurements of these radiative decays will distinguish between these predictions .",
