    "in recent years , theories of the formation and evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been dominated by a simple geometric unification model @xcite .",
    "it is envisaged that an optically thick obscuring torus lies between the broad - line and narrow - line regions at a distance of @xmath9  pc from the central black hole , and the orientation to the line - of - sight of this torus is the dominant parameter in determining the observational properties of an agn .",
    "the opening angle of the torus is such that it blocks the view of the optical / uv continuum and broad - line region for most observers , and therefore accounts for the observed dominance of narrow - line agn ( type 2s ) over broad - line agn ( type 1s ) in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the torus will also produce absorption in the x - ray band , and , indeed x - ray observations generally show that optical type 2 agn exhibit more soft x - ray absorption than type 1 objects @xcite .",
    "however , there are exceptions to this rule ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and rapid absorption variability observed in some local agn @xcite indicate that refinements to the toroidal unification picture are required .",
    "the geometric agn unification model is also an important component in explaining the shape of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ; @xcite ) at energies @xmath10  kev .",
    "between 1 and 20  kev  the cxrb can be described by a power - law with a photon - index of @xmath11 @xcite , while most unobscured agn are observed to have @xmath12 ( after taking into account the effects of compton reflection ; @xcite ) .",
    "it was therefore postulated that the spectrum of the cxrb can be built up by summing the spectra of many obscured agn over a distribution in redshift , luminosity and absorbing column density @xmath13  ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this picture has now been largely confirmed by very deep x - ray observations by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  that have resolved 5090% of the background below 10  kev  into individual sources @xcite .",
    "interestingly , optical followup of these objects have shown that they mostly reside at redshifts @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have x - ray luminosities typical of seyfert galaxies ( @xmath15  erg  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the predictions of the earlier synthesis models @xcite which were based on the local type 2/type 1 ratio , and thus expected a large number of type 2 quasars  obscured high luminosity objects ( @xmath16  erg  s@xmath1 )  at redshifts @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "x - ray luminosity functions measured by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that at @xmath18 the space density of agn is dominated by moderate - luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "@xcite argue , however , that an unevolving unified model ( i.e. , a torus ) is still consistent with the data if the deep surveys are subject to significant selection effects ( see also @xcite ) .    at the same time as the cxrb was being revealed , observations by the _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ showed a remarkable connection between the mass of the supermassive black hole in the centers of local , inactive galaxies and the mass of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "it now seems clear that the growth of both the central black hole and galaxy must be connected in a fundamental way , and that feedback from the accreting black hole and/or star forming - regions have a significant impact on the structure of the bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the connection between star - formation and black hole accretion has long been suspected based on observations of local seyfert 2s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further evidence has been provided by the redshift distribution of the _ chandra _  cxrb sources @xcite , which peaks at about the same redshift as the cosmic star formation rate @xcite .",
    "more recent cxrb synthesis models which allow type 2 objects to separately evolve as infrared - bright star - forming galaxies @xcite can reproduce the low-@xmath3 peak in the redshift distribution , but seem to overpredict the number of obscured agn at @xmath19 @xcite .    recent observations are providing significant pressure on the basic assumption that an unevolving unified model can be applied for all agn at all redshifts .",
    "the comprehensive optical follow - up work of @xcite on x - ray deep fields provides compelling evidence that the fraction of type 1 objects increases significantly with luminosity even at redshifts as low as @xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "the large numbers of obscured seyferts at @xmath22 indicate galaxy formation and evolution is still ongoing at this era , but is evidently different than the earlier quasar epoch which seems to have a much smaller fraction of obscured agn @xcite .",
    "perhaps there are large numbers of type 2 quasars which have been missed in the deep surveys due to selection effects ( i.e. , buried quasars which release the majority of their bolometric luminosity in the infrared ; @xcite ) , a possibility that future _ spitzer _ surveys should elucidate . alternatively , the lack of type 2 quasars may be explained by invoking the receding torus model @xcite , where , because of the effects of dust sublimation , the inner radius of the torus is increased at higher luminosity .",
    "another possibility is that radiation pressure flattens the torus in high luminosity objects @xcite .",
    "both these explanations , since they assume no connection between the agn and the host galaxy , should be independent of redshift , but figure  19 in the paper by @xcite also shows evidence that the broad - line agn fraction decreases with redshift at a given luminosity .",
    "these authors find that at the redshift where the bulk of the cxrb is produced ( @xmath23 ) , the type 1 fraction at a luminosity of @xmath24  erg  s@xmath1 is only @xmath2520% as compared to 7080% at @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the low redshift ( @xmath27 ) optical type 1 and 2 luminosity functions constructed by @xcite from nearly 3000 agn in the sloan digital sky survey find a type 2/type 1 ratio of approximately unity at low seyfert luminosities , with type 1s dominating at higher luminosities ( see also @xcite ) . these results all imply that the obscuring material responsible for blocking the agn continuum in seyfert 2s evolves with redshift , as well as luminosity . moreover ,",
    "if the sloan results are accurate the absorbing medium must evolve so that it increases its covering fraction by a factor of 34 from @xmath28 to @xmath7 .",
    "this evolution exactly tracks that of the star formation rate in the universe .",
    "the central idea proposed here is that the obscuration important for providing the correct shape of the cxrb is regulated by and controlled via active star - formation within the galaxy .",
    "the actual processes responsible for the obscuration are unknown , but it may be associated with star - formation on many - hundred pc scales , or be brought in closer to the nucleus by a starburst disk @xcite .",
    "thus , the type 2/type 1 ratio does evolve with redshift and peaks at @xmath7 , where both the star - formation rate is a maximum and the majority of the obscured agn discovered by the deep surveys are found .",
    "similar ideas have been discussed before @xcite , but here we use the latest observational constraints on the cxrb spectrum , source number counts and type 2/type 1 ratio ( @xmath29 ) to determine what kind of agn evolution is possible and if it is consistent with the above hypothesis .",
    "we begin by describing in the next section the calculation of the cxrb spectrum and number counts , including assumptions on the agn spectral model and evolution of @xmath30 .",

    "a number of key ingredients must be specified .      for the normalization and evolution of the space density of agn",
    ", we use the hard x - ray luminosity function ( hxlf ) of @xcite .",
    "it is defined for the absorption corrected luminosity in the rest - frame 210  kev  band .",
    "as it is absorption - corrected , it describes the density and evolution of all detected agn , both type 1 and 2 .",
    "@xcite found that the evolution of the luminosity function was best described using a luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model such that the lower luminosity objects peaked in density at lower redshift than sources with higher luminosities .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that pure luminosity evolution was the best fit to their hard x - ray luminosity function at @xmath19 .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite and @xcite have both found that ldde best describes agn evolution from @xmath28 to @xmath49 . in this paper",
    ", we assume the ldde model and parameters of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we take @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , where from this point on the luminosity @xmath4 refers to 210  kev  luminosity .",
    "consistent with using the @xcite hxlf where there is no distinction between the type 1 or type 2 objects , a single spectral model is assumed for all the agn in the calculation .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that there is little change in the x - ray spectral shape of agns over a large range of luminosity and redshift .",
    "the spectrum defined here consists of a power - law with photon - index @xmath12 and high - energy rollover at 375  kev , augmented by compton reflection .",
    "the pexrav model of @xcite is used to calculate the reflection spectrum with a reflection fraction of unity , solar abundances , and an inclination angle of 63  degrees .",
    "this model is very similar to ones assumed in other cxrb synthesis calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum was calculated from 0.1 to 900  kev  in 1000 logarithmically spaced steps .      the following expression is used to convert from 210  kev  flux , @xmath54 , to luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) : @xmath55      as has been standard over the last few years , type 2 objects are defined here to be those which are seen through columns @xmath56 , with type 1s being less absorbed .",
    "once the ratio of absorbed to unabsorbed objects ( @xmath30 ) is calculated for a given @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see   [ sub : ratio ] ) , the @xmath13  distribution for the obscured and unobscured agn must be defined . however , the distribution of absorbing columns for agn is unknown except for locally , where @xcite measured it for nearby luminous seyfert  2s .",
    "ten @xmath13  bins are defined in the calculation : @xmath57 .",
    "the implicit assumption is that objects which are severely compton - thick with @xmath58 will not significantly contribute to the observed cxrb . in lieu of any other information , we first make the simplest choice and assume a flat @xmath13distribution for both type 1 and type 2 sources .",
    "computations were also performed with the @xcite distribution where 75% of all type 2s have @xmath59 and half are compton thick .    for @xmath60 ,",
    "the solar abundance photoelectric cross - sections of @xcite are used to modify the spectrum . at higher columns , where compton scattering becomes important within the absorber",
    ", we extracted the results plotted by @xcite and divided them by their incident spectrum ( @xmath61 power - law with cutoff energy of 500  kev ) to obtain the absorption / transmission curve in our energy range .",
    "we then applied the appropriate curve to our model spectrum to account for compton - thick absorbing columns .",
    "the effects of correctly including the absorption and transmission properties of compton - thick columns are illustrated in figure  [ fig : tu ] where we reproduce the results of @xcite . including the proper treatment of compton thick absorbers produced a poorer fit for this set of parameters .",
    "the central hypothesis in this work is that the type 2/type 1 ratio , @xmath30 , will increase with redshift until @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , @xmath30 will decrease with @xmath4 as seen in many recent observational campaigns .",
    "since the leading explanations for this effect are based on radiative processes associated with the central engine , we assume that there is no redshift dependence for this @xmath4-evolution .",
    "there is still , however , immense freedom in how the evolution of @xmath62 can be described , and as can be seen from previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cxrb is not very constraining on its own .",
    "we therefore make use of the results presented by @xcite in their figure  19 which shows the observed fraction of type  1 objects as a function of 28  kev  luminosity in three different redshift bins : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "while the exact parameterization of @xmath62 remains unconstrained , barger s data provides landmarks to which the model can be pinned .",
    "ideally , we would be able to compute the type  1 fraction from a self - consistent model of star formation and black hole growth from redshift 1 to zero .",
    "however , such a complicated calculation is not necessary for this study . at this stage , it suffices to determine if redshift evolution of @xmath30 is needed to explain the observations , and , if so , to quantify the degree of the evolution .",
    "we are thus searching for the best description of @xmath62 that simultaneously accounts for barger s data , the cxrb spectrum , and the x - ray number count distributions ( in multiple bands ) .    in practice , we do not compute @xmath62 , but the related quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the fraction of type 2s and type 1s , respectively .",
    "these three parameters are related by @xmath68 and @xmath69 four different parameterizations were used to explore the evolution of the agn type 2/type 1 ratio from @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the assumptions outlined above , these particular forms were chosen solely as good candidates for accounting for the observed data from @xcite , i.e. , to smoothly run from 01 over the observed range of @xmath4 .",

    "the @xmath89 data point in the @xmath90 bin and the @xmath91 point in the @xmath92 bin are omitted in the @xmath86 calculation because they were an upper - limit or had very small errorbars .",

    "section  [ sect : results ] presented moderately strong evidence for redshift evolution of the obscuring medium around an agn , but the strength of that evolution depends on the assumption on what the local type 2/type 1 ratio is at low @xmath4 .",
    "on one extreme , if we accept the sloan results that @xmath107 @xcite , then very strong @xmath3 evolution is needed ( @xmath129 ) in order to account for the cxrb spectrum ( figs .",
    "[ fig:1to1 ] and  [ fig:1to1risaliti ] )",
    ". however , this parameterization completely fails to fit the type 1 ratios observed by @xcite , requiring the x - ray surveys to miss many low - luminosity unobscured sources and high luminosity obscured agn . on the other hand , models which best fit the barger data ( e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig:6to1 ] and  [ fig:6to1risaliti ] ) can not reproduce the shape of the cxrb spectrum for any @xmath80  there are too many unobscured agn .",
    "we conclude that the best compromise solution is the @xmath110 model shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:4to1 ] and  [ fig:4to1risaliti ] .",
    "this parameterization provides an adequate fit to the barger data and a good match to the observed shape of the cxrb spectrum and x - ray number counts .",
    "it predicts a redshift evolution of the type 2 agn fraction of @xmath130 .",
    "we prefer this solution over the @xmath107 sloan - inspired model because the value of @xmath80 is consistent with earlier work @xcite and it requires fewer missing obscured sources at higher @xmath3 .",
    "the implication is that the sloan work is missing local obscured sources",
    ". these could be agn whose narrow - line regions are obscured and reddened , and therefore only appear as agn in the x - ray ( i.e. , x - ray bright optically inactive galaxies or elusive agn ; @xcite ) .",
    "future observational work is required to accurate measure the local value of @xmath30 over a range in @xmath4 .",
    "this type of measurement is vital to the understanding of agn and galaxy evolution  only when the local type 2/type 1 ratio is well known can the amount of evolution be determined .",
    "as described by @xcite , it is likely that the deep x - ray surveys are missing heavily obscured agn , especially ones that are compton thick .",
    "evidence for this can be seen in the hard x - ray number counts , which have yet to exhibit a turnover @xcite , and the stacking analysis of @xcite , who shows that the cxrb may only be @xmath131  % resolved at @xmath132  kev .",
    "we propose that the missing obscured agn predicted by the evolution model will mostly be compton thick , but that the type 2/type 1 ratio will only be @xmath133 at higher agn luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) .    comparing the results of the cxrb model between a simple uniform @xmath13distribution and",
    "the @xcite one , where half of the seyfert 2s are compton thick , showed that additional compton thick sources over the uniform model are needed to improve the fit to the cxrb spectrum at @xmath134  kev .",
    "however , the @xcite ratio is too large to hold in general , because the 28  kev  number counts are significantly underpredicted .",
    "similar to @xmath30 , the fraction of compton - thick seyfert 2s is likely to be a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , measurements of the @xmath13  distribution at different redshifts and luminosities are needed to accurately constrain the predictions of cxrb synthesis models . a focusing hard x - ray instrument , such as _ _ nustar _",
    "_ , is necessary to discover and trace the evolution of the compton thick agn population .",
    "these three topics are discussed together because our results , when combined with recent observational and theoretical work , now show that they are connected and dependent processes . one can not discuss the formation and evolution of a galaxy without accounting for the growth of its black hole @xcite .",
    "similarly , we assert that the evolution of agn and their observational appearance is connected to the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "the fact that the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn increases with redshift requires a change to the traditional unification paradigm . since the obscuring medium is changing with @xmath3 it must be influenced by forces and evolution on the extragalactic scale . the cosmic star formation rate , which peaks at a very similar redshift as @xmath30 , seems to be the most likely candidate .",
    "as star formation increases in a galaxy it signals an increase in the amount of absorbing gas and dust present that can act as an obscuring medium for any agn .",
    "the location of the absorbing material would depend on the location and size of the star forming regions and could exist close to the dust sublimation radius ( and thus mimic some properties of an absorbing torus ) , but could also be spread over a large extent in the inner part of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the idea of an extended , more galactic - scale obscuring medium is consistent with recent infra - red ( ir ) observations which have pointed out the remarkable similarity in the mid - to - far - ir emission between seyfert 2s and 1s @xcite , in contrast to the predictions of the simple molecular torus model .",
    "of course , galactic scale obscuration of agn emission is commonly seen in the x - ray band when observing the massively - star - forming ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if , as seems to be the case , galactic star formation and agn activity are related then the question of agn fueling arises ( see recent review by @xcite ) . at this point it is important to distinguish between high luminosity quasars and lower luminosity seyferts , which dominate the production of the cxrb .",
    "as is well known , quasars peak in density at high redshift ( @xmath135 ) , and here interactions between gas - rich disk galaxies are more common @xcite and would cause the ignition of a substantial starburst and accretion onto a black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , only these most luminous agns show observational evidence for interactions @xcite . at lower luminosities",
    "there is little observational evidence for seyfert galaxies being associated with mergers @xcite .",
    "likewise , there is no evidence that the decline in star formation from @xmath2 is due to a decrease in major mergers @xcite .",
    "rather , it is possible that at lower redshifts most interactions of a large disk galaxy are with smaller , gas poor satellites @xcite that may trigger an accretion phase onto the black hole , but with a much lower amount of obscuration regulated by the associated star formation .",
    "therefore , it is not valid to apply the results of major merger calculations to observations like the cxrb which are dominated by seyferts .",
    "depending on the exact nature of the interaction , a number of different obscuration geometries could be set up around the black hole , from a nearby starburst disk to an extended gas / dust lane ( cf .",
    "* ) . also , because fueling a black hole is difficult ( the angular momentum problem ; @xcite ) , a very long time may pass following the interaction before any gas makes it close enough to the center to be accreted rapidly onto the hole .",
    "this delay between the causal event and the resulting agn activity could mask the cause from observations , particularly if the interaction is weak .",
    "thus , the galaxy may not look like it was disrupted by a merger or interaction , but the resulting star formation and agn activity could still be ongoing .",
    "the power of the cxrb spectrum and the deep x - ray surveys is that they allow an investigation of the global properties of agn over cosmic time .",
    "we now know that most of the accretion in the universe is obscured , and that this obscuration evolves similar to the star - formation rate .",
    "these facts deepen the connection between star - formation and agn fueling as well as between black hole growth and galaxy evolution . to fully explore and understand these connections , the sources of the cxrb must be found and investigated in more detail over a range of redshift and luminosity .",
    "this paper explored the hypothesis that the obscuration around an agn evolves with both redshift and luminosity .",
    "the motivation behind this idea is that the obscuration is due to star - formation ongoing in the host galaxy .",
    "our conclusions are the following :    * to the extent that the type  1 agn fractions observed by @xcite are accurate , redshift evolution of the type  2/type  1 agn ( @xmath30 ) to @xmath7 is required to best fit the data . * the evolutionary model that most successfully reproduced the barger data , the cxrb spectrum , and the x - ray number counts had @xmath136 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the redshift evolution of the type 2 agn fraction is @xmath5 . *",
    "these models imply that the deep x - ray surveys are missing about 50% of obscured agn with @xmath6 at all @xmath3 .",
    "these are likely to be mostly compton thick . * additional compton - thick sources above the uniform @xmath13",
    "distribution improve the fit to the cxrb spectrum .",
    "however , applying the @xcite distribution , where 50% of all type 2s are compton thick , over all @xmath4 and @xmath3 underpredicts the 28  kev  number counts .",
    "the fraction of compton thick obscured objects should be less than 50% but will likely vary with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "* there are very tentative indications that the covering factor evolves more slowly with @xmath3 for more luminous agn .",
    "* a simple , non - evolving torus can not alone provide the agn obscuration over all cosmic time , and the shape of the cxrb spectrum is due to obscuration correlated with star - formation within the evolving host galaxy .",
    "* seyfert galaxies , which dominate the production of the cxrb , are likely fueled by minor mergers or interactions which trigger a star formation event somewhere in the nuclear region .",
    "unlike quasars , there may be a significant delay between the interaction and the subsequent ignition of the agn .",

    "<S> as a result of deep hard x - ray observations by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  a significant fraction of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) has been resolved into individual sources . </S>",
    "<S> these objects are almost all active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and optical followup observations find that they are mostly obscured type 2 agn , have seyfert - like x - ray luminosities ( i.e. , @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 ) , and peak in redshift at @xmath2 . since this redshift is similar to the peak in the cosmic star - formation rate , this paper proposes that the obscuring material required for agn unification is regulated by star - formation within the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we test this idea by computing cxrb synthesis models with a ratio of type 2/type 1 agn that is a function of both @xmath3 and 210  kev  x - ray luminosity , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary models are constrained by parameterizing the observed type 1 agn fractions from the recent work by barger et al . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization which simultaneously best accounts for barger s data , the cxrb spectrum and the x - ray number counts has a local , low-@xmath4 type 2/type 1 ratio of 4 , and predicts a type 2 agn fraction which evolves as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> models with no redshift evolution yielded much poorer fits to the barger type 1 agn fractions . </S>",
    "<S> this particular evolution predicts a type 2/type 1 ratio of 12 for @xmath6 , and thus the deep x - ray surveys are missing about half the obscured agn with these luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> these objects are likely to be compton thick . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization also predicts a covering fraction approaching unity at @xmath7 and @xmath8 which would be very difficult to explain using a simple unevolving torus model . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these calculations show that the current data strongly supports a change to the agn unification scenario where the obscuration is connected with star formation in the host galaxy rather than a molecular torus alone . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the obscuration implies a close relationship between star formation and agn fueling , most likely due to minor mergers or interactions . </S>"
