    "in contrast to the @xmath6 , experimental results on radiative decays of the @xmath7 to non - charmonium hadrons are scarce ; in the latest particle data group tables , only upper limits for a few decay modes are listed  @xcite . moreover , it is found experimentally that , while decays to @xmath8 and @xmath9 vector pseudoscalar ( _ vp _ ) final states are significant ( @xmath10 ) for the @xmath6 , hadronic decays of the @xmath7 to these same _ vp _ final states are strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this longstanding mystery of charmonium physics is referred to in the literature as the @xmath8 puzzle  @xcite .",
    "the processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are radiative _ vp _ channels that have been measured by several experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to see if the same radiative _ vp _ decays of the @xmath7 are suppressed to the same extent as the hadronic @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays .",
    "recently , the cleo experiment has reported an anomalously large branching fraction for the inclusive production of @xmath3 in the @xmath13-meson decay @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes an inclusive hadronic system containing a strange quark  @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation is the presence of an intrinsic charm component of the @xmath3 meson induced by the strong coupling of the @xmath3 to gluons via the qcd axial anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath3-@xmath4 mixing has been proposed as the dominant mechanism for the ozi forbidden radiative charmonium decays such as @xmath16 and @xmath12 . in this case , the branching fraction for @xmath2 is estimated to be in the range @xmath17  @xcite .    the ratio of the @xmath18 and @xmath12 decay rates of the @xmath19 charmonium states is sensitive to the pseudoscalar octet - singlet mixing angle @xmath20 .",
    "assuming that the process occurs primarily through radiation of the photon from one of the initial state @xmath21-quarks and the applicability of su(3 ) symmetry for the decay amplitudes , one has the simple relation  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the momentum of the @xmath25 ( @xmath3 ) in the @xmath26 rest frame .",
    "the measured @xmath6 branching fraction values  @xcite imply a mixing angle of @xmath27 ( the second error is theoretical ) , which agrees well with the value determined from other processes  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the corresponding branching fractions for the @xmath7 provide a consistency check of this relation .",
    "in this report we present the first measurement of the branching fractions for @xmath2 and @xmath5 using @xmath28 @xmath7 decays collected using the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) located at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) at the beijing institute of high energy physics .",
