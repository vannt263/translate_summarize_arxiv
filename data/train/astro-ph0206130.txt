    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars were originally defined by sargent and searle as stars with colours corresponding to those of b stars in which the balmer lines are abnormally broad compared to those seen in population i main - sequence stars .",
    "subdwarf o ( sdo ) stars and subdwarf ob ( sdob ) stars are related stars of correspondingly earlier spectral type ( see , e.g. , vauclair & liebert 1987 ) . based on an interpretation of their evolutionary state , sdb stars are also sometimes referred to as extreme horizontal branch stars .",
    "they are generally considered to be core helium burning stars with extremely thin hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath4 ) , and most of them are believed to have masses around @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "indeed , a recent asteroseismological analysis by brassard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has confirmed a mass of 0.49@xmath6 for the sdb star pg 0014 + 067 . in this paper",
    ", we collectively refer to core helium burning stars with thin hydrogen envelopes as sdb stars if they are located in the corresponding region in a ( @xmath7 , @xmath3 ) diagram , even if some of them may in reality be sdo or sdob stars .",
    "subdwarf b stars form an important class of objects in several respects . at the galactic level , they are the dominant population in surveys of blue objects @xcite and constitute a population of stars that are important for our understanding of the structure and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "pulsating sdb stars @xcite provide a standard candle for distance determinations . on a larger cosmological scale",
    "they have been used to constrain the ages of the oldest galaxies and hence cosmological models .",
    "the latter is based on measuring the age of giant elliptical galaxies from the ultraviolet ( uv ) excess , or `` upturn '' , with the help of evolutionary population synthesis models where low mass core - helium burning stars provide the dominant source of uv radiation @xcite .    more importantly , sdb stars are exotic objects because of their thin hydrogen - rich envelopes . understanding the process of their formation helps to improve our understanding of the theory of stellar and binary evolution",
    ".    there have been extensive surveys of sdb stars in the past .",
    "magnitude - limited and colour - selected samples have been obtained from the palomar green ( pg ) survey @xcite ( magnitude limit @xmath8 ) and the kitt peak downes ( kpd ) survey @xcite ( magnitude limit @xmath9 ) .",
    "saffer et al .  ( 1994 ) measured atmospheric parameters , such as effective temperature , surface gravity and photospheric helium abundance , for 68 sdb stars .",
    "ferguson , green & liebert found 19 sdb stars with main sequence ( ms ) companions from the pg survey and derived a binary frequency of about 50 percent .",
    "allard et al .   found 31 sdb binaries from 100 candidates chosen from the pg and the kpd surveys and estimated that 54 to 66 percent of sdb stars are in binaries with ms companions after taking selection effects into account .",
    "thejll , ulla & macdonald and ulla & thejll also found that more than half of their sdb star candidates showed infrared flux excesses , indicating the presence of binary companions .",
    "aznar cuadrado & jeffery obtained atmospheric parameters for 34 sdb stars from spectral energy distributions and found that 19 were binaries with ms companions , while 15 appeared to be single .",
    "these observations showed that at least half of the sdb stars were in binaries .",
    "a major recent development has been the identification of many sdb stars as short - period binaries @xcite . in particular , maxted et al .   concluded that more than two thirds of their candidates were binaries with short orbital periods from hours to days and that most of the known companions were white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "a variety of formation channels for sdb stars have been proposed in the past but mainly for single sdb stars because of the absence of identified sdb star binaries at the time . in the merger channel , two helium white dwarfs in a close binary",
    "are driven together by the orbital angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave radiation . when the white dwarfs merge and the merged object ignites helium , this produces a single sdb star @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "stellar wind mass loss near the tip of the first giant branch ( fgb ) may strip off a giant s envelope and leave an almost bare helium core .",
    "if helium is ignited in the core , the star will appear as a single sdb star @xcite .",
    "sweigart has studied the evolution of globular - cluster stars and suggested that helium mixing driven by internal rotation substantially increases the helium abundance in the envelope ; this may lead to enhanced mass loss along the fgb and the formation of a sdb star .    on the other hand , mengel , norris & gross carried out conservative binary evolution calculations for a binary system with initial masses of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and a composition @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and showed that there exists a range of initial separations for which stable mass transfer can produce an sdb star of @xmath14 in a wide binary .    from a binary evolution point of view , these formation channels are not complete .",
    "when a star fills its roche lobe near the tip of the fgb , mass transfer begins and may be dynamically unstable .",
    "this leads to the formation of a common envelope ( ce ) @xcite , where the ce engulfs the helium core and the secondary .",
    "due to friction between the envelope and the immersed binary , the orbit shrinks , depositing a large amount of orbital energy in the envelope .",
    "if this energy is enough to eject the envelope and if helium is subsequently ignited in the core , a sdb star in a short - period binary is formed with a mass near @xmath5 .",
    "these are exactly the types of objects identified in large numbers by maxted et al .  .",
    "if mass transfer near the tip of the fgb is dynamically stable , the envelope of the primary is lost as a result of stable rlof , and the remnant core will be in a binary system with a long orbital period .",
    "it becomes a sdb star when helium in the primary s remnant is ignited .",
    "an additional channel for the formation of sdb stars in wide binaries , which has not received much attention in the past , involves binaries that experience stable rlof when passing through the hertzsprung gap ( so - called early case b mass transfer ) ( han , tout & eggleton 2000 ; han et al .",
    "2002 ; in preparation [ henceforth , paper ii ] ) .",
    "all of the sdb binaries produced through stable rlof channels are consistent with the observations by green , liebert & saffer who showed that some sdb stars appear to be members of long - period binaries .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to re - examine the various scenarios for the formation of sdb stars in some detail . in this first paper",
    ", we concentrate on the individual evolutionary channels . using detailed stellar and binary calculations ,",
    "we model the physics and appearance of sdb stars and then test individual evolutionary channels using binary population synthesis ( bps ) .",
    "we demonstrate that all of the main evolutionary channels proposed previously can lead to the formation of sdb stars . as a by - product we constrain the ce ejection efficiency from the observed period distribution of compact sdb binaries to arrive at a physically motivated and experimentally calibrated prescription for the ce phase .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the stellar evolution code and the binary population synthesis code adopted in this study . in section 3 , we present the conditions for the formation of sdb stars from the ce ejection channel , their evolutionary tracks and simplified bps models to constrain the ce ejection efficiency . in section 4 , we derive the conditions for helium ignition in objects that result from the merger of two he white dwarfs and use monte carlo simulations to determine their mass distribution . in section 5",
    ", we investigate the criterion for stable rlof and the formation of sdb stars in wide binaries . in the follow - up paper ( paper ii )",
    "we will apply these results to a comprehensive binary population synthesis study and will estimate the relative importance of these individual channels .",
    "in this study , we employ two numerical computer codes : a stellar evolution code to determine the structure and follow the evolution of sdb stars , and a binary population synthesis code to examine different evolutionary channels .",
    "the stellar evolution code used is the one that has been originally developed by p. p. eggleton , which has been updated with the latest input physics over the last 3 decades as described by han , podsiadlowski & eggleton   and pols et al .  .",
    "the code distinguishes itself by the use of a self - adaptive non - lagrangian mesh , the treatment of both convective and semiconvective mixing as diffusion processes and the simultaneous and implicit solution of both the stellar structure equations and the chemical composition equations which includes convective mixing .",
    "these characteristics make the code very stable and easy to use .",
    "the current code uses an equation of state that includes pressure ionization and coulomb interaction , recent opacity tables derived from rogers & iglesias and alexander & ferguson , nuclear reaction rates from caughlan & fowler and caughlan et al . , and neutrino loss rates from itoh et al ..    we set @xmath15 , the ratio of the mixing length to the local pressure scale height , to 2 .",
    "for population i ( pop i ) stars ( with a typical composition of hydrogen abundance @xmath16 , helium abundance @xmath17 and metallicity @xmath18 ) , such a value for @xmath19 gives a roughly correct lower main sequence , as determined observationally by andersen .",
    "it also well reproduces the location of the red giant branch in the hr diagram for stars in the hyades supercluster @xcite , as determined by bessell et al .  .",
    "a fit to the sun also leads to @xmath20 as the most appropriate choice @xcite .    for convective overshooting",
    ", the code does not employ a prescription in terms of the pressure scaleheight @xmath21 where the overshooting length is a fixed fraction of @xmath21 .",
    "instead the code uses an approach based on the stability criterion itself , the ` @xmath22 prescription ' , by incorporating a condition that mixing occurs in a region with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure and @xmath22 is a specified constant , the overshooting model parameter .",
    "critical tests of stellar evolution by means of double - lined eclipsing binaries @xcite show that @xmath25 gives the best fit to the observed systems , where @xmath25 corresponds to an overshooting length of @xmath26 pressure scale heights .",
    "roche lobe overflow is treated directly within the code .",
    "it has been tested thoroughly and works very reliably . because the mesh - spacing is computed along with the structure , the inclusion of rlof is almost trivial",
    ": it just requires a modification of one surface boundary condition .",
    "the boundary condition is written as @xmath27 \\label{boundary}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 gives the rate at which the mass of the star changes , @xmath29 is the radius of the star , and @xmath30 the radius of its roche lobe .",
    "@xmath31 is a constant . with @xmath32yr",
    ", rlof proceeds steadily , and the lobe - filling star overfills its roche lobe as necessary but never overfills its lobe by a substantial amount ( typically @xmath33 ) .    the stellar evolution code described above evolves only a single star or both components of a binary at a time .",
    "however , stellar evolution theory should give and predict the _ statistical _ properties of a whole stellar population as well as the properties of individual stars or binaries . in order to investigate statistical properties of stars and check evolutionary mechanisms for different types of stars , han , podsiadlowski & eggleton developed a monte carlo simulation code , or ` binary population synthesis ' ( bps ) code , which is able to evolve a sample of 1 million or more stars ( including binaries ) simultaneously by interpolating the properties of individual stars as a function of evolutionary age in a specially prepared grid of stellar models .",
    "this code has been steadily updated ever since @xcite .",
    "the bps code needs a grid of stellar evolution models .",
    "taking pop i as the standard population model , we carried out a large number of stellar evolution calculation for a wide range of masses ( @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) , including the evolution of helium stars from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , at an interval of @xmath38 in @xmath39 . in the calculation of the stellar models ,",
    "we did not include stellar wind mass loss for most of the grids calculated .",
    "however , for massive stars the evolution was terminated at the humphreys - davidson ( hd ) limit @xcite ; we assumed that at the hd limit the envelope of the massive star was lost completely , and then treated the remnant core as a helium star .",
    "the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars was terminated at the point when the total energy of the envelope became positive , assuming that the envelope was ejected at this point , leaving a white dwarf remnant @xcite . for a given star",
    "we obtain the required stellar parameters at a particular evolutionary age ( e.g. the luminosity , effective temperature , radius , core mass , core radius , envelope binding energy ) by interpolation from our set of stellar evolutionary tracks .    in bps , one has to evolve binaries as well as single stars . at present stellar wind mass loss and binary interactions",
    "are included in the form of simple prescriptions .",
    "we plan to replace these by ever more realistic modelling as part of our ongoing work .",
    "one important improvement we have implemented in the present work is that we adopted full binary evolution calculations for systems where rlof occurs in the hertzsprung gap @xcite .",
    "another uncertainty which we will address in more detail in the future is the criterion for dynamically unstable rlof . if the primary fills its roche lobe as a red giant , rlof may be dynamically unstable if the mass ratio at the onset is larger than some critical value @xmath40 , given e.g. by hjellming & webbink and webbink .",
    "however , this critical mass ratio only applies to conservative rlof and does not fully take into account the detailed dynamics at the onset of mass transfer . from observations",
    "it is clear that rlof on the fgb / agb is non - conservative @xcite .",
    "part of the transferred mass is lost from the system . in our model",
    "we assume that the lost matter carries away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the system . defining a mass transfer efficiency , @xmath41 , as the ratio of the mass accreted by the secondary to the mass transferred from the primary ( @xmath42 for conservative rlof ) , we find that the critical ratio @xmath40 depends strongly on the mass transfer efficiency @xcite .",
    "dynamically unstable mass transfer may result in the formation of a common envelope ( ce ) @xcite , leading either to the formation of a close binary or the complete merger of the two components ( see section 3 ) .",
    "given a binary sample , the bps code performs all the necessary interpolations in the model grid , integrates the mass loss along evolutionary tracks for an assumed stellar - wind law and deals with all the binary interactions .",
    "the output of the code are all the parameters for different types of binaries or single objects formed as a consequence of the evolution and various interactions .    in the original version ,",
    "the bps code used the following stellar model grids as input :    1 .",
    "z=0.02 , no stellar wind , no overshooting , 0.08 - 126.0@xmath43   for normal stars",

    "in the common - envelope ( ce ) channel , the sdb star forms in a close binary as a consequence of dynamical mass transfer and a ce phase where the progenitor , a giant star , starts to fill its roche lobe when it is relatively close to the tip of the first red - giant branch ( fgb ) .",
    "this situation generally occurs when the radius of the mass - losing star increases faster than its roche - lobe radius .",
    "this leads to mass transfer on a dynamical timescale and the formation of a common envelope where the envelope of the giant engulfs both its degenerate core and the companion star .",
    "friction between these orbiting components and the envelope causes the orbit of the immersed binary to shrink .",
    "if the orbital energy released in the process is able to eject the envelope , this process leaves a very tight binary consisting of the degenerate core of the giant and the companion star .",
    "this is believed to be the main mechanism , originally proposed by paczyski ( 1976 ) , by which an initially wide binary is transformed into a very close system .",
    "if this happens when the giant was sufficiently close to the tip of the fgb at the beginning of mass transfer , i.e. the core was close to experiencing the helium flash , the remnant core of the giant may still ignite helium ( as first demonstrated by castellani & castellani 1993 ) and hence become a helium core - burning sdb star , where the companion can be either a white dwarf ( wd ) or in some cases a low - mass star .",
    "these are exactly the objects observed in large numbers by maxted et al .. note that the companion star can in principle also be a normal dwarf star with a mass as high as @xmath48 ( which depends on the condition for dynamical mass transfer ; see  5.1 ) .",
    "however , such a system would have a composite spectrum .",
    "since such systems were excluded from the pg catalog , they would not appear in radial - velocity studies based on this catalog .",
    "the details of ce evolution , in particular the conditions for which the envelope can be ejected are far from well understood at the present time ( see e.g. iben & livio 1993 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the identification of a large number of sdb stars in very close binaries , which must all have passed through such a well - defined evolutionary channel , provides a unique opportunity to test particular models of ce evolution and may even help to calibrate the criterion for ce ejection .",
    "indeed , it is one of the surprises of the observations by maxted et al .   that the period distribution is extremely wide ranging from 2hr to more than @xmath49d .",

    "as the figure shows , there is generally excellent overlap between the evolutionary tracks and the observed systems . to show this more systematically , panel ( b ) of figure  [ sdb - evol ] presents the tracks for sdb stars of a typical mass of @xmath75 , but with different masses of the hydrogen - rich envelope , ranging from 0 to @xmath76 ( here the envelope is defined as the outer part of the sdb star with a hydrogen mass fraction larger than 0.01 ) .",
    "the two dashed curves give the location of the zahb ( right curve ) and the location where the sdb stars exhaust helium in their centres ( left curve ) .",
    "tick marks are also shown along the tracks to indicate the speed of evolution across the diagram .",
    "as one would expect , sdb stars without hydrogen envelopes are the hottest and the most compact , and the evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower temperatures and lower gravity as the mass in the hydrogen - rich envelope is increased .",
    "the majority of observed systems lie between the dashed curves , marking the range of helium core - burning objects .",
    "there appears to be , however , a fairly large range of envelope masses from 0 to @xmath77 .",
    "there are also a few objects that lie significantly outside the helium core - burning band .",
    "while evolutionary tracks will pass through most of these observational points after the end of helium core burning , this corresponds to a fast evolutionary phase , as can be seen from the wide separation of tick marks .",
    "a more likely explanation is that some of these are more massive objects . in panel ( c ) of figure  [ sdb - evol ]",
    "we show the dependence of evolutionary tracks of sdb stars on convective overshooting .",
    "the sdb stars without convective overshooting display ` breathing pulses ' ( see e.g. castellani et al .",
    "1985 ) . in panel ( d ) of figure  [ sdb - evol ]",
    "we show the dependence of the location of the helium core - burning sdb stars on the mass of the sdb star for 3 envelope masses ( 0.001 , 0.002 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the masses of the sdb stars range from 0.35 to @xmath79 ( note that sdb stars more massive than @xmath80 can form in some of the other evolutionary channels discussed later in this paper ) helium core - burning star that was artificially transformed into a sdb star of the chosen total mass and envelope mass . ] .",
    "four of the six objects that were outside the helium core - burning band in panel ( b ) fall onto a helium core burning track with a more massive sdb star .",
    "this may provide an indication that some of the sdb stars have masses as high as @xmath81 .",
    "the two remaining objects ( pg 1553 + 273 and pg 1051 + 501 ) , both of which show low radial velocity variations , lie well above all of these tracks .",
    "this suggests that they have either substantially more massive envelopes ( see section 5 ) or have already exhausted helium in their cores and are now evolving quickly away from the horizontal branch .",
    "ce evolution is one of the most important but also one of the least understood phases of binary evolution ( see iben & livio 1993 ; taam & sandquist 2000 ; podsiadlowski 2001 for reviews with different emphasis ) .",
    "one of the uncertainties is related to the conditions under which a binary experiences dynamical mass transfer and a ce phase ( this will be further discussed in   5.1 ) . a second area of uncertainty",
    "is related to the criterion for the ejection of the ce , which crucially determines the orbital period distribution of post - ce binaries .",
    "the latter depends on what fraction of the orbital energy that is released in the spiral - in process can be used to drive the ejection , which depends on the efficiency with which energy can be transported to the stellar surface where it can be radiated away .",
    "it also depends on the efficiency of the dynamics of the ejection process ; e.g. if the envelope is ejected with a velocity much larger than the surface escape velocity , the efficiency per unit mass will be reduced ( see e.g. the discussion in taam & sandquist 2000 ) .",
    "a further factor is related to the question what fraction of the thermal energy , in particular the ionization energy , can be converted into kinetic energy and can help to drive the expansion of the envelope .",
    "this is particularly important for giants that fill their roche lobes near the tip of the fgb or the agb since in such extended stars the total binding energy of the envelope , including the ionization energy , is greatly reduced and ultimately becomes 0 ( see han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 ; hpe ) .",
    "this has the consequence that very little spiral - in is required to release , in principle , enough energy to eject these loosely bound envelopes ; this leads to post - ce binaries with relatively long orbital periods .    in binary population synthesis ( bps )",
    "studies it is commonly assumed that the common envelope is ejected when the change in orbital energy times some efficiency factor , @xmath82 , exceeds the binding energy of the envelope , where the latter is often approximated by a simple analytical expression . our approach is rather different from this and it is designed to provide a more physical parametrization of the ce - ejection process .",
    "our common - envelope ejection criterion can be written as @xmath83 the left - hand side represents the fraction of the change in the orbital energy that can be used for the ejection , as in most other commonly used prescriptions . however , on the right - hand side , we include both the gravitational energy of the envelope ( @xmath84 ) and a fraction @xmath85 of its thermal energy ( @xmath86 ) , which in particular includes the ionization energy .",
    "moreover , instead of using analytical approximations for these energies , we use the values obtained from full stellar structure calculations ( see hpe for details and also dewi & tauris 2000 ) . the fact that we have 2 parameters , @xmath82 and @xmath85 , instead of one allows us to specifically assess the importance of the thermal energy contribution .",
    "indeed , the observations of post - ce sdb binaries from this well - defined evolutionary channel may allow the calibration of this parameter  at least in principle .      in order to test the ce ejection criterion",
    ", we need to perform a binary population study where we simulate the period distribution of sdb binaries after the ejection of the common envelope . to avoid unnecessary complications",
    ", we use a simplified bps model in this section , simplified in the sense that we do not model the evolution of the system before the ce phase that leads to the formation of the close sdb binary .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to systems where the companion star is likely to be a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the model is completely specified by three distributions : the distribution of the white - dwarf mass , the mass of the giant and the orbital separation before the ce phase .",
    "we use a uniform distribution in @xmath87 from 1 to 4 where @xmath88 is the orbital separation , a simple wd mass distribution ( @xmath89 for @xmath90 or @xmath91 ) and a miller & scalo mass distribution for the giant between 0.8 and @xmath92 . the wd mass distribution may seem a little bit odd at first sight , but it actually mimics the bimodal mass distribution of wds after the first rlof phase as found in previous bps studies @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that because of the wide distribution in @xmath93 it is almost certain that the resulting orbital period distribution of post - ce sdb binaries will be wider than what would be obtained in a more realistic simulation , since in a full bps simulation only a subset of this parameter space would be realized by actual systems ( see paper ii ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall show below , this method still provides a good diagnostic for the ce efficiency .      in our first series of bps simulations ,",
    "we assume a population i metallicity of @xmath18 and include convective overshooting ( of 0.25 pressure scale heights ) .",
    "we consider 3 sets of stellar models : ( 1 ) models with no stellar wind ; ( 2 ) models with a reimers wind mass loss with @xmath94 ; and ( 3 ) models with a reimers wind with @xmath95 .",
    "for each of these 3 sets we take six combinations of ce parameters @xmath82 and @xmath85 , including both efficient and inefficient models .",

    "first , note by comparing the three panels that the different assumptions about the stellar wind make relatively little difference . on the other hand",
    ", the variation of the ce parameters affects the orbital period distributions quite dramatically .",
    "the overall behaviour of the various curves is relatively easy to understand .    in the case of inefficient ce ejection , i.e. low @xmath82 ,",
    "the binary has to spiral in much further during the ce phase before enough energy has been deposited in the envelope to make ejection possible , resulting in very short orbital periods . as @xmath82 is increased , the orbital period distribution shifts towards longer orbital periods .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath85 also increases the post - ce orbital periods , since it reduces the binding energy of the envelope .",
    "it also widens the period distribution very substantially .",
    "this reflects the relative importance of the ionization energy which varies significantly between a star of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . for a @xmath104 star ,",
    "the total binding energy of the envelope near the tip of the fgb is close to 0 ( in fact , it may be positive , see hpe ) , implying that the envelope is only very loosely bound and that very little spiral - in is required to eject it .",
    "on the other hand , the envelope of a @xmath105 star is much more tightly bound , leading to much smaller post - ce orbital periods of the systems .",
    "some of the curves ( e.g. the dotted ones ) have three peaks .",
    "the left one corresponds to giants with @xmath106 which have much more tightly bound envelopes than fgb stars with @xmath107 .",
    "since this requires much deeper spiral - in before the envelope can be ejected , it leads to the shortest orbital periods .",
    "the middle and the right peaks are the result of ce ejections for fgb stars with @xmath107 , where the middle peak corresponds to white dwarf primaries with @xmath108 and the right peaks to white dwarfs with @xmath109 . in cases where the ce ejection is not very efficient ,",
    "i.e. either @xmath82 or @xmath85 is small , the differences in the period distributions for the two sets of white dwarfs tends to be small and the latter two peaks tend to merge into one .",
    "the short ticks in these panels along the orbital period axis show the periods of sdb binaries with known orbital periods @xcite .",
    "as is clear by inspection , the simulated period distributions taken together cover the whole range of observed periods , although no single model on its own provides a perfect fit to the observed distribution .",
    "the best models require high values for both @xmath82 and @xmath85 in order to cover the whole range of orbital periods . inspection of panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ sbps - p ] suggests that the dotted simulations with @xmath110 provide the best overall representation of the observed period distribution .",
    "such a combination of parameters is physically quite reasonable , since it suggests that both the ejection of the common envelope and the conversion of thermal ( and ionization ) energy are efficient processes , but are not perfect .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical ce ejection simulations @xcite and independent constraints from bps studies of other post - ce binaries with relatively long orbital periods ( e.g. certain symbiotic stars and barium stars ; see han et al . 1995 ) , which require fairly efficient ce ejection .    in figure  [ sbps - tg ]",
    ", we present various simulated distributions of the best overall model , i.e. the model with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ sbps - tg ] are scatter diagrams in the @xmath7  @xmath3 and the h - r diagram , respectively .",
    "we assumed that the envelope masses are uniformly distributed between 0.0 and @xmath113 .",
    "this leads to the concentration of sdb stars in the upper - right part in panel ( a ) or the right part in panel ( b ) ( see panel ( b ) of figure  [ sdb - evol ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the observed distribution of sdb stars in figure  [ sbps - tg](a ) overlaps nicely with the simulated distribution .",
    "the systems that fall outside the theoretical region are the same as those already discussed in   3.2 .",
    "these may be more massive sdb stars or those with larger hydrogen - rich envelopes and may originate from some of the other sdb channels discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "there are no observational data points @xcite in the lower - right part of panel ( a ) due to observational selection effects ( this point will be addressed in detail in paper ii ) .    figure  [ sbps - mf]a shows the simulated distribution of the mass function for sdb stars and figure  [ sbps - mf]b compares the mass function distribution for different masses of the sdb star . while this comparison should not be taken too literally ( since it relies on a very simplified and incomplete bps model )",
    ", it confirms that a model with a sdb mass of @xmath14 provides an overall good fit to the observed distribution , consistent with earlier findings ( e.g. heber 1986 ) .",
    "figure  [ sbps - m ] gives the simulated distributions of masses of sdb stars .",
    "the distributions have three peaks  a sharp major peak at @xmath75 , a secondary peak at @xmath114 , and a minor peak at @xmath115 .",
    "the major peak is caused by systems with a low - mass zams secondary where the ce is ejected near the tip of fgb ( see figure  [ min - core ] ) .",
    "the secondary peak is due to the fact that the range in stellar radius which leads to ce ejection near the tip of the fgb and produces sdb stars is wider for @xmath116 than for @xmath117 ( see table  [ min - core - tab ] ) .",
    "furthermore ce ejection with @xmath118 results in a low - mass sdb star which has a long core helium - burning lifetime .",
    "the minor peak contains systems which had a zams mass greater than the helium flash mass .",
    "the figure shows that almost all the simulated masses of sdb stars are less than @xmath119 , which means that the sparsely scattered dots at @xmath120 in figure  [ sbps - tg ] correspond to the post - central - helium - burning phase of sdb stars .      in order to test how the results depend on metallicity",
    ", we also performed a series of simulations representing a thick disc population with a metallicity @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "these results are shown in panel ( d ) of figure  [ sbps - p ] ( for the same combinations of ce parameters as in ",
    "3.4.1 ) and are quite similar to the previous case .",
    "however , the middle and the right peaks discussed in ",
    "3.4.1 merge into a single peak .",
    "the reason for this convergence is that lower - metallicity giants are hotter and more compact , and therefore have more tightly bound envelopes .",
    "different wds then lead to smaller differences between orbital periods for the post - ce systems , causing a merging of the two peaks .      in this section",
    "we have shown that helium - burning sdb stars in compact binaries can be formed if the progenitor giants filled their roche lobe when they were close to the tip of the fgb .",
    "figure  [ p - range ] shows the range of orbital periods at the beginning of mass transfer as a function of zams mass for which the core ( degenerate if @xmath107 for pop i or @xmath122 for @xmath63 ) will subsequently ignite helium .",
    "since this is a well - defined evolutionary channel , it provides an excellent diagnostic to test the criterion for the ejection of the ce . in figure  [ p - tg ] we plot systems with determined orbital periods in the @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath3 diagram where the size of the symbols indicates the orbital period",
    ". there may be a weak hint that the systems with longer orbital periods are less compact and cooler , which implies that they have bigger envelope masses .",
    "this would be consistent with simple expectations for ce ejection , since larger remnant envelopes may remain bound to the system if the envelope is ejected at a wider separation .",
    "on the other hand , a small fraction of sdb stars may result from ce ejections with @xmath123 for pop i or @xmath124 for @xmath63 . since the envelope of these more massive giants",
    "are more tightly bound and the orbital energy available in the spiral - in phase is smaller ( due to the smaller orbital period of the pre - ce system ) , sdb stars produced from more massive giants tend to have very small orbital periods .",
    "most of these sdb stars have fairly low masses ( @xmath74 ) and are probably selected against in the observational sample ( see paper ii ) .",
    "our analysis , however , raises a few further issues .",
    "the first is the question whether the orbital parameters that lead to the formation of the compact sdb binary , in particular the orbital period range in figure  [ p - range ] , are being realized by actual binaries ( note that we do not plot the figure for stars more massive than @xmath125 , as they hardly contribute to the formation of sdb stars due to their tightly bound envelopes ) .",
    "this depends on the previous binary evolutionary phases , which have not been modelled in this paper , but will be addressed in paper ii .",
    "a second problem is that we found that there is no single combination of the ce parameters @xmath82 and @xmath85 that produces a perfect fit to the observed period distribution for both metallicities considered .",
    "it is quite possible that the observed wide distribution is at least in part a consequence of a large variation of metallicities and possibly even a variation in the ce ejection parameters . considering how uncertain the theoretical modelling of the ce phase is at present",
    ", this would not be very surprising .",
    "finally we would like to point out an alternative possibility : in recent studies of the dynamics of the ce ejection process , ph.p .",
    "( see e.g. the discussion in podsiadlowski 2001 ) found that even in cases where the envelope is not ejected in the initial dynamical phase , it will always be ejected at a later stage if the spiralling - in star is relatively compact and penetrates into the initially radiative layer of the giant .",
    "an example for such a delayed dynamical ejection is shown in figure  [ vrp ] , which represents a 1-dimensional , hydrodynamical simulation of the spiral - in of a @xmath126 compact star spiralling into the envelope of a 1.6@xmath43 giant .",
    "the initial spiral - in is very rapid ( see the thick solid curve ) , but slows down once the envelope has expanded significantly and the friction between the spiralling - in binary and the envelope has decreased ; in the subsequent slow spiral - in , the envelope is close to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , once the compact object reaches the initially radiative region , a dynamical instability ensues that it is likely to lead to the ejection of the envelope .",
    "while this result should only be considered tentative at the moment , we note that the conditions for such a delayed dynamical instability depend mainly on the structure of the giant and can not be described , not even in principle , by a simple @xmath19 ejection criterion .",
    "the characteristic period obtained in this case is of order @xmath127 , similar to the shortest periods of observed sdb binaries .",
    "if this is the process that leads to the formation of sdb binaries with the shortest orbital periods , one may expect to see some structure and possibly even some evidence for a bimodal orbital period distribution , for which there is no evidence at the moment .",
    "a second channel that can lead to the formation of a single sdb star involves the merger of two he white dwarfs @xcite . close",
    "he wd binaries are formed as a result of one or two ce phases @xcite .",
    "if the orbital period is sufficiently short ( typically less than 6.76 hr for a @xmath126+@xmath126 pair to merge in 15gyrs ) , gravitational radiation will cause such a system to shrink until the lighter white dwarf fills its roche lobe at a typical period of @xmath128min .",
    "mass transfer will be dynamically unstable when the lighter white dwarf is larger than @xmath129 2/3 the mass of the more massive component @xcite .",
    "this leads to its dynamical disruption and the formation of an accretion disc surrounding the more massive white dwarf @xcite .",
    "while the subsequent evolution has not been modelled in any detail , it is probably reasonable to expect that a large part of this accretion disc will be accreted by the more massive component .",
    "this accretion will initially occur on a dynamical timescale , but , as the mass in the disc decreases and the disc expands , the accretion rate will decrease and be ultimately determined by the internal viscous processes that govern the evolution of the disc . as the mass of the white dwarf increases , there will be a point at which helium is ignited in a shell and the star will subsequently become a helium core - burning sdb star due to the inward propagation of these nuclear burning shells @xcite . unlike the other scenarios considered in this paper",

    "[ stable - rlof - sdb ]    to determine the conditions for the formation of sdb stars through the stable rlof channel , we performed a series of binary stellar evolution calculations for mass donors with different masses on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , ranging from 0.8 to @xmath105 .",
    "for each mass , we systematically varied the mass of the core at the beginning of mass transfer and the mass of the companion star . in these calculations we assumed that mass transfer was completely non - conservative , and that all the mass that was lost from the system carried with it the orbital angular momentum of the accreting component ( as appears to be most appropriate if the accretor is a white dwarf ) . in the standard set of calculations , we included a reimers - type wind with @xmath139 ( see equ .",

    ", we checked first whether mass transfer was dynamically stable . in cases , where mass transfer is dynamically unstable",
    ", there is no solution for the mass - transfer rate , @xmath140 , for which the radius of the secondary can be equal to the roche - lobe radius ( see han , tout & eggleton 2000 for the treatment of the surface boundary condition ) . if mass transfer is stable , we continued mass transfer until the mass donor started to shrink below its roche lobe , terminating the mass - transfer phase .",
    "if , at this point , the mass of the h - exhausted core exceeded the appropriate minimum core mass for subsequent helium ignition ( as determined in ",
    "3.1 ) , it may appear as a helium core - burning sdb star .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized in tables  [ stable - rlof ] and  [ stable - rlof - sdb ] , which show for each zams mass the core mass and the total mass of the mass donor at the beginning of mass transfer and the minimum mass of the secondary ( and critical mass ratio ) for which mass transfer is stable and leads to the formation of a helium - burning sdb star .",
    "these results demonstrate , as discussed above , that mass transfer is dynamically stable even if the mass donor is substantially more massive than the secondary and that sdb stars can form through this channel without any non - standard assumptions . for stars with zams masses",
    "@xmath141 , the secondary mass has to be larger than @xmath142 , which is similar to the maximum mass of a white dwarf , and hence does not correspond to realistic systems with white - dwarf accretors .",
    "note that , for each mass , the critical mass ratio tends to decrease for the initially more evolved systems , since for these the evolutionary timescale is shorter and hence the mass - transfer rate higher than for the less - evolved ones .",
    "this has the consequence that the core mass grows less during the mass - transfer phase .",
    "one may also notice that some of the behaviour in table  [ stable - rlof ] is non - monotonic .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath143 at the lowest @xmath133 is caused by primaries with a core mass @xmath133 near the base of the fgb , where the core is not very degenerate and the envelope is not yet fully convective .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour for @xmath144 stars with the largest @xmath133 is a consequence of its thin envelope mass .",
    "while these calculations show that sdb stars can form in wide binaries without any non - standard assumptions , it is quite plausible , perhaps even likely , that the wind mass - loss rate before the beginning of the rlof phase will be enhanced due to the tidal interaction with the companion ( as originally proposed by eggleton & tout 1989 ) .",
    "the main effect this has is to increase the overall parameter space for which this channel produces sdb stars in wide binaries .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ min - wd ] , which shows the minimum mass of the accreting white dwarf as a function of the zams mass of the donor for the standard model used above and two sequences of calculations , where we assumed that the pre - rlof wind mass loss rate was enhanced by a factor of 4 and 8 , respectively ( i.e. we took @xmath145 and 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ binary ] shows a representative binary calculation from one of the sequences in the previous section for a star with a zams mass of @xmath104 . at the beginning of mass transfer , the mass donor has a core mass of @xmath146 and a total mass of @xmath147 , and the mass of the companion star is @xmath148 . with these parameters , mass",
    "transfer starts at an orbital period of 348.4d .",
    "initially , mass transfer occurs on a thermal timescale and reaches a maximum of @xmath149 .",
    "after the mass ratio has been reversed and the star has regained thermal equilibrium , mass transfer settles to a rate of @xmath150 and gradually decreases as the secondary ascends the giant branch . once the mass in the h - rich envelope drops below @xmath151 , the secondary shrinks below the roche lobe and mass transfer stops .",
    "as the remnant envelope collapses , the secondary quickly moves across the h - r diagram and ultimately becomes a sdb star of @xmath152 in a wide binary with an orbital period of 948.9d .    whether the secondary becomes a sdb star and its location both in the @xmath7  @xmath3 and the h - r diagram also depends on mass loss via a stellar wind after the rlof phase .",
    "for example , consider a binary with an orbital period of 606d consisting of a giant with a total mass of @xmath153 and a core mass of @xmath154 ( which corresponds to one of the sequences with a @xmath104 zams star ) in orbit with a @xmath155 white dwarf .",
    "if wind mass loss is switched off once the system has entered the rlof phase , the giant starts to ignite helium when its core mass reaches @xmath156 , but its total mass is still @xmath157 ( the system has an orbital period of 1306d at this point ) .",
    "if there is no further mass loss , the secondary will then settle on the normal horizontal branch , burn helium in the core and then ascend the asymptotic - giant branch ( agb ) ( this typically requires an envelope mass larger than @xmath158 ; see dorman , rood , oconnell 1993 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if wind mass loss is not switched off during the rlof phase but continues at a rate of 1/4 of the reimers rate , the total mass is @xmath159 when helium is ignited in the core of mass @xmath156 . in this case it has the appearance of a sdb star lying in the upper - right corner of the @xmath7  @xmath3 diagram .",
    "as we have shown in this section , stable rlof provides a third channel for the formation of sdb stars .",
    "these will generally be in wide binaries with typical orbital periods of @xmath160d .",
    "the mass distribution is similar to the distribution in the ce channel .",
    "however , one might expect that the envelope masses could be systematically larger than in the ce ejection case , since the orbital period is much longer , which means that a larger envelope mass may remain bound to the degenerate core when the donor becomes detached .",
    "this would suggest that sdb stars formed through this channel would be less compact and cooler than their counterparts from the ce channel .",
    "the importance of this channel is difficult to assess .",
    "while standard assumptions lead to the formation of sdb stars , the allowed range for the binary parameters is probably quite small in this model , since it requires relatively massive white dwarfs , which are not very common .",
    "however , this parameter range could be dramatically increased if the stellar - wind mass - loss rate is significantly enhanced , e.g. due to the tidal interaction with the companion star @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "observational surveys could in principle allow the calibration of such enhanced stellar winds .",
    "one may notice that we only deal with wd companions in this section , though stable rlof with ms companions can also produce sdb stars .",
    "observational surveys show that at least half of all sdb stars have cool ms companions ( see section 1 ) .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the observations by maxted et al .   that the majority of sdb stars are short - period binaries with wd companions , as it implies a binary fraction larger than 1 .",
    "the contradiction is due to various observational selection effects and will be addressed in paper ii .    in this section , we made the simplifying assumption that mass transfer to a wd companion is completely non - conservative in the stable rlof channel .",
    "this assumption is appropriate for low mass - transfer rates , where nova explosions are believed to be effective in expelling all of the transferred matter , but probably not for higher rates ( larger than @xmath161 ) , where the white dwarf may be able to accrete most of the transferred matter and burn it steadily ( as in supersoft x - ray binaries ) . on the other hand , for even higher rates the white dwarf will start to swell up @xcite and may then lose most of the transferred mass again , possibly in the form of an optically thick wind @xcite .",
    "clearly all of these effects need to be studied further and should be included in future studies .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that the three binary evolution channels that have been proposed for the formation of sdb ( and related sdo / sdob ) stars may all contribute to the observed population .    in the ce ejection channel , which may account for more than 2/3 of all sdb stars , dynamically unstable mass transfer near the tip of the fgb results in the formation of a ce and spiral - in phase , leaving a short - period binary after the envelope has been ejected .",
    "the system becomes a sdb binary if helium is ignited .",
    "using detailed stellar evolution calculations , we have determined how close to the tip of the fgb the progenitor has to be at the onset of rlof . using simplified binary population synthesis calculations ,",
    "we have been able to show that the ce ejection process has to be very efficient and that the ionization energy in the envelope has to be included in the ejection criterion in order to be able to explain the observed orbital period distribution .    in the stable rlof channel ,",
    "the progenitor systems experiences stable mass transfer in which the giant is stripped off its envelope as a result of the mass transfer .",
    "if this occurs near the tip of the fgb , the remnant helium core will still ignite helium in the core and become a sdb star in a binary with a long orbital period and a fairly thick hydrogen - rich envelope as compared to the other channels . using detailed binary evolution calculations",
    ", we demonstrated that this channel usually requires a fairly massive white dwarf companion or enhanced stellar wind mass loss before the onset of rlof ( e.g. tidally enhanced winds ) .",
    "double he wds may coalesce due to gravitational wave radiation .",
    "when helium is ignited in the merger , a single sdb star is formed , and its hydrogen envelope is likely to be very thin . we have determined the conditions for which the merged system will be able to ignite helium .    in a follow - up paper",
    "we will implement these results in full binary population synthesis calculations to assess their relative importance and to allow direct comparison with observed subdwarf populations .",

    "<S> the ce ejection channel leads to the formation of sdb stars in short - period binaries with typical orbital periods between 0.1 and 10d , very thin hydrogen - rich envelopes and a mass distribution sharply peaked around @xmath0 . on the other hand , under the assumption that all mass transferred is soon lost </S>",

    "<S> the merger channel gives rise to single sdb stars whose hydrogen - rich envelopes are extremely thin but which have a fairly wide distribution of masses ( 0.4  0.65@xmath1 ) . </S>",
