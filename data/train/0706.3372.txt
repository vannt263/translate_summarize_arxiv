    "as observed , this influence can span over orders of magnitude in some real networks .",
    "our analytical estimations are proved as valid expectation values of reciprocity by comparison to ensemble averages of random networks which preserve desired types of correlations .",
    "both from a theoretical and a practical point of view , it would be highly desirable to extend the current work and obtain expected values of other network measures , e.g. clustering coefficient , average pathlength , motif profiles , etc . following a similar philosophy :",
    "analytical expressions should be computable using only information that can be directly measured from the specific real network under study . in the absence of such results , for the moment , the numerical methods introduced in this paper are a useful tools for significance testing of network measures under conditions of prescribed degree sequences and degree correlations .",
    "the dynamical influence of degree correlations has been studied for epidemic spreading  @xcite and for synchronization in undirected networks  @xcite . in the light of our results , which clearly relate reciprocity and degree correlations ,",
    "it is important to also investigate the influence of reciprocity on those phenomena for the broader class of directed networks .    in order to perform satisfactory modeling , the key parameters governing network growth and evolution need to be identified .",
    "therefore , theoretical understanding of the interplay between different topological properties is necessary to distinguish between the significant measured values and those expected as by - products of other properties . in this paper",
    ", we have explored the interplay between degree correlations and network reciprocity .",
    "previous efforts in this direction include relations between degree correlations and clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "degree correlations are also expected to be relevant for other network measures , e.g. , pathlength , network motifs , modularity , etc . therefore ,",
    "further work is desirable to extend the analytical and experimental approaches presented in this paper .",
    "no doubt , quantification of similar structural interrelations will significantly elucidate the essence of the structure - function - evolution interplay in complex networks .",
