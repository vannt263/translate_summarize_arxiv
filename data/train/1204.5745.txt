    "furthermore , both sources have only recently emerged in the mid - ir .",

    "[ fig : colmag ] , these properties are unique to j18103305 and sakurai .",
    "the nature of j18103305 is completely unknown , but these facts suggest that its ir photometric properties are analogous to sakurai .",
    "sakurai is known to have ejected a large amount of dust around 1998 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if j18103305 also ejected dust recently , the optical and near - ir are expected to have faded and reddened since peak brightness , while the mid and far - ir fluxes would rise due to dust reemission .",
    "the extremely red w3w4 color of both these sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : colmag ] is indicative of the presence of dust .",

    "this suggests that dust ejection occurred sometime between the  and 2mass epochs .",
    "the  sed implies a much lower thermal temperature ( @xmath24@xmath10320 k ) in 2010 , though a single modified blackbody sed does not fit the observed fluxes well ( a mix of multi - temperature components is likely ) .",

    "the bolometric ir power of j18103305 has declined by a factor of @xmath105 between the 2mass and  epochs .",
    "regarding other wavelengths , in the optical a historical counterpart exists for j18103305 , but was not known pre-1991 for sakurai .",
    "multiwavelength variability is a common characteristic in both objects . in the far - ir regime ,",
    "the  65 and 90  data of j18103305 lie above the extrapolation of the blackbody curve overlaid on the  data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , suggesting the presence of additional cooler dust already in existence in 2006 , or some systematic change in dust properties . unfortunately ,  did not carry out sufficient scans of sakurai for accurate far - ir photometry .",
    "j18103305 lies more than 6 degrees below the galactic plane ( @xmath32=1@xmath33.0 , @xmath34=6@xmath33.6 ) . the integrated galactic neutral gas column ( ) along this line - of - sight",
    "is determined to be = 1.88@xmath3510@xmath36 @xmath37 @xcite . for a typical milky way dust : gas ratio , this translates into a reddening value of = 0.32 @xcite , or an optical extinction = 1.0 for a standard extinction curve slope with @xmath38=3.1 .",

    "[ fig : sed ] plots the plausible range of observed optical fluxes after accounting for these uncertainties . the overall sed shape in the optical appears to have been red , and the redder colors suggest a tentative late ( k or m ) type classification .",
    "j18103305 may thus be in an earlier evolutionary phase as compared to the post - agb phase that sakurai was discovered in .",
    "sakurai displayed a sharp increase in its optical fluxes around 1991 @xcite .",
    "the rising optical phase for j18103305 may have already begun before the mid-1980s , according to its brightening @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes . if the historical optical data probe pre - dust - ejection photospheric fluxes of a late - type central star with an sed peak around @xmath101  , then  should have brightened by @xmath10100 in order to power the hot 2mass emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the emerging picture is that we could be observing early dust ejection during the thermal pulse of an agb star .",
    "the presence of an optical pre - cursor , its ( tentative ) late - type classification , the rapid and strong increase in  and the massive amount of dust ejected ( @xmath40@xmath1010@xmath42 ) are all consistent with this scenario .",
    "the dust ejection epoch ( @xmath49 ) lies between the  ( 1983 ) and 2mass ( 1998 ) observations .",
    "@xmath49 may be estimated by assuming that the dust exists in a single shell in instantaneous thermal equilibrium with stellar heating .",

    "if the expansion velocity remained constant since @xmath49 , backward extrapolation places @xmath49 between 1996 october and 1998 july . using a more realistic @xmath25 increases @xmath56 and pushes @xmath49 closer to the 2mass epoch .",
    "the @xmath22 band , on the other hand , shows a mild historical decline .",
    "this may be a sign of erratic ( early - time ) photometric variability such as sakurai exhibited at late times @xcite , though the large photometric uncertainties make conclusive inferences impossible .",
    "if  did increase @xmath10100-fold post-1983 , it would imply a peak @xmath22 mag @xmath1010.511.4 , similar to sakurai .",
    "if so , why was the appearance of a new bright star not reported for j18103305 ?",
    "one possibility is a very brief period between brightening and dust obscuration .",
    "moreover , the source location is far enough outside the galactic plane that it does not fall in intensively - monitored fields , but is still close enough to the plane that the field is relatively crowded in the optical making it a non - trivial study for amateur observations .",
    "the rapid evolution of sakurai outpaces all canonical predictions made by theory of post - agb stars , which expects slower flux changes from the onset of the helium flash @xcite .",
    "in contrast , j18103305 may now be providing us a testbed for studying the helium flash of the ( earlier ) agb phase . the infrared brightening and reddening appear to be coeval in both objects , but the earlier optical rise of j18103305 suggests that the optical evolution of j18103305 may be slightly slower than that of sakurai (   [ sec : optical ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the post-2mass  decline indicates that the central star could already be relaxing following the thermal pulse , unlike the apparently steady output of sakurai .",
    "if so , the thermal pulse lasted no more than @xmath1030 years  the interval from the optical measurements of the late-1980s to the  epoch .",
    "this is exceptionally - brief even compared to the ultra - short  mass - loss timescales of @xmath1010@xmath57 years considered in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the other possibility is that multi - temperature expanding shells result in complex optical depth effects unaccounted for in the  computation .",
    "large sky surveys are optimal for serendipitously catching rare objects .",
    "the fact that only two sources ( j18103305 and sakurai ) in the entire  preliminary database share similar properties emphasizes the rare ( brief ) nature of such events .",
    "only a handful of other sources have been compared to sakurai ( e.g. a  30 , a  78 , fg sge , v605 aql and v838 mon ; @xcite ) . almost all are in more advanced states of evolution , and none appears to be coeval with sakurai .",
    "j18103305 thus provides a unique opportunity for follow - up .    ascertaining the degree of affinity between these sources requires optical and infrared spectroscopic observations of j18103305 in order to determine its spectral class , measure element abundances and understand the nature of circumstellar dust .",
    "irrespective of these comparisons , however , it appears that we have identified a massive dust ejection event at early times , making wise j18103305 an interesting object in its own right .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of a source with broadband infrared photometric characteristics similar to sakurai s object .  </S>",
    "<S> ( hereafter , j18103305 ) shows very red  colors , but a very blue 2mass [ @xmath0 vs.  [ w1 ( 3.4 ) ] color . </S>",
    "<S> it was not visible during the  era , but now has a 12  flux well above the  point source catalog detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> there are also indications of variability in historical optical photographic plates , as well as in multi - epoch  mid - infrared measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the broadband infrared spectral energy distribution shape , post-  brightening and multiwavelength variability are all characteristics also shared by sakurai s object  a post asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) star which underwent a late thermal pulse and recently ejected massive envelopes of dust that are currently expanding and cooling . </S>",
    "<S> optical progenitor colors suggest that j18103305 may have been of late spectral class . </S>",
    "<S> its dramatic infrared brightening , and the detection of a late - type optical counterpart are consistent with a scenario in which we have caught an extremely massive dust ejection event ( in 1998 or shortly before ) during the thermal pulse of an agb star , thus providing a unique opportunity to observe stellar evolution in this phase . </S>",
    "<S> j18103305 is the only source in the entire  preliminary data release with similar infrared sed and variability , emphasizing the rarity of such sources . </S>",
    "<S> confirmation of its nature is of great importance .    </S>",
