    "a _ relativistic positioning system _ is defined by four clocks @xmath0 ( _ emitters _ ) in arbitrary motion broadcasting their proper times @xmath1 in some region of a ( four - dimensional ) space - time @xcite .",
    "the future light cones of the points @xmath2 constitute coordinate hypersurfaces @xmath3 of a coordinate system for that region . indeed , at every event of the domain , four of these cones broadcasting the times @xmath1 intersect , endowing thus the event with the _ emission coordinates",
    "_ @xmath4 the four proper time signals received by any observer at the event from the four clocks .    as a _ location system _",
    "( i.e. as a physical realization of a mathematical coordinate system ) @xcite , the above positioning system presents interesting qualities and , among them , those of being _ generic _ , ( gravity-)_free _ and _ immediate_. this fact has been pointed out elsewhere @xcite and some explicit results have been recently obtained for the generic four - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "a full development of the theory for this generic case requires a hard task and a previous training on simple and particular situations . in @xcite",
    "we have presented a two - dimensional approach to relativistic positioning systems introducing the basic features that define them .",
    "we have obtained the explicit relation between emission coordinates and any given null coordinate system wherein the proper time trajectories of the emitters are known .",
    "we have also developed in detail the positioning system defined in flat space - time by geodesic emitters .",
    "finally , we have shown that , in arbitrary two - dimensional space - times , the data that a user obtains from the positioning system determine the gravitational field and its gradient along the emitters and user world lines .",
    "this two - dimensional approach has the advantage of allowing the use of precise and explicit diagrams which improve the qualitative comprehension of general four - dimensional positioning systems .",
    "moreover , two - dimensional scenarios admit simple and explicit analytic results .",
    "these advantages encourage us in proposing and solving new two - dimensional problems , many of them already suggested in a natural way by the results presented in @xcite .    in the present work we want to detect the possibility of making relativistic gravimetry or , more generally , the possibility of obtaining the dynamics of the emitters and/or of the user , as well as the detection of the absence or presence of a gravitational field and its measure .",
    "this possibility is here examined by means of a ( non geodesic ) _ stationary positioning system _ , that is to say a positioning system whose emitters are uniformly accelerated and the radar distance from each one to the other is constant .",
    "such a stationary positioning system is constructed in two different scenarios : minkowski and schwarzschild planes .    in both scenarios , and for any user , the trajectory of the emitters in the _ grid _ , i.e. in the plane @xmath5 are two parallel straight lines . at first glance , this fact would seem to indicate the impossibility to extract dynamical or gravimetric information from them , but this appearance is deceptive .",
    "we shall prove that the simple qualitative information that the positioning system is stationary ( but with no knowledge of the acceleration and mutual radar distance of every emitter ) and that the space - time is created by a given mass ( but with no knowledge of the particular stationary trajectories followed by the emitters ) allows to know the actual accelerations of the emitters , their mutual radar distances and the space - time metric in the region between them in emission coordinates @xmath6 also , the transformations to other standard coordinate systems may be obtained .",
    "the important point for gravimetry is that , in the above context , the data of the schwarzschild mass may be substituted by that of the acceleration of one of the emitters .",
    "then , besides all the above mentioned results , including the obtaining of the acceleration of the other emitter , the actual the schwarzschild mass of the corresponding space - time may be also calculated .",
    "these relatively simple two - dimensional results strongly suggests that relativistic positioning systems can be useful in gravimetry at least when parameterized models for the gravitational field may be proposed .    a comment about the presentation of the results .",
    "the user is supposed to continuously receive data from the positioning system and have some a priori information about it and/or the space - time .",
    "because of their operational importance , the statements involving exclusively consequences of these two types of knowledge , have been emphasized and numbered .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section - previous ] we summarize the basic concepts and notation about relativistic positioning systems in a two - dimensional space - time .",
    "sections [ section - iii ] and [ section - iv ] are devoted to the analysis of stationary positioning systems respectively in minkowski and in schwarzschild planes . in sections",
    "[ section - gravimetry ] and [ section - grav - along ] we analyze the roles that different user s data play in obtaining the gravitational field and in recovering the characteristics of the positioning system .",
    "finally , we finish with a short discussion about the present results and comments on prospective work in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "in a two - dimensional space - time , let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the world lines of two clocks measuring their proper times @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "suppose they broadcast them by means of electromagnetic signals , and that the signals from each one of the world lines reach the other .",
    "this system of two clocks ( _ emitters _ ) is called a _",
    "relativistic positioning system_.    a domain @xmath11 in the region between both emitters constitutes a _",
    "coordinate domain_. indeed , the past light cone of every event in @xmath11 cuts the emitter world lines at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath14 are the coordinates of the event : the two proper time signals received by any observer at the event from the two clocks",
    ". we shall refer to them as the _ emission coordinates _",
    "@xmath15 of the system in @xmath11 . also ,",
    "by continuity , we shall call _ emission coordinates of the emitters _ the pair of proper times formed by the proper time of the clock in question and that received from the other clock . nevertheless , the signals @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not constitute coordinates for the events in the outside region .    the plane @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in which the different data of the positioning system can be transcribed is called , as already remembered , the grid of the positioning system . in this grid , the trajectories of the two emitters ( which , for the auto - locating positioning systems considered below , can be drawn from the positioning data broadcast by the emitters ) define an interior region and two exterior ones .",
    "this interior region in the grid is in one - to - one correspondence with the interior region in the space - time , i.e. with the set of events that can be distinguished by the pair of times @xmath14 that reach them .",
    "but the exterior regions in the grid are not in one - to - one correspondence with the corresponding exterior regions in the space - time , because these last regions are foliated by null geodesics whose events have all the same values @xmath14 that the emission coordinates of the emitter that borders the region .",
    "so , the pairs @xmath14 of the exterior regions in the grid _ are not _ emission coordinates : they do not correspond to pairs of signals broadcast by the two emitters .",
    "consequently , for this emission protocol , they do not correspond to points of the two - dimensional space - time ( nevertheless , as mathematical extensions , they could be of interest in some situations ) .",
    "the grid origin depends exclusively on the choice of the instant zero of the emitter clocks .",
    "this synchronization is not a necessary prior information for positioning and it can be obtained from the system data .",
    "emission coordinates are null coordinates and thus the space - time metric depends on the sole _ metric function _",
    "@xmath18 : @xmath19    an observer @xmath20 traveling throughout an emission coordinate domain @xmath11 and equipped with a receiver allowing the reading of the received proper times @xmath14 at each point of his trajectory , is called a _ user _ of the positioning system .",
    "from now on we will consider _ auto - locating positioning systems _ , which are systems in which every emitter clock not only broadcasts its proper time but also the proper time that it receives from the other , i.e. the systems that broadcast the emission coordinates of the emitters .",
    "thus , the physical components of an auto - locating positioning system are @xcite a _ spatial segment _",
    "constituted by two emitters @xmath7 , @xmath8 broadcasting their proper times @xmath21 @xmath10 _ and _ the proper times @xmath22 , @xmath23 that they receive each one from the other , and a _ user segment _ constituted by the set of all users traveling in an internal domain @xmath11 and receiving these four broadcast times @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth remarking that any user receiving continuously the emitted times @xmath25 knows his trajectory in the grid .",
    "indeed , from these _ user positioning data _ @xmath25 the equation @xmath26 of the user trajectory may be extracted : @xmath27    on the other hand , any user receiving continuously the _ emitter positioning data _",
    "@xmath24 may extract from them not only the equation ( [ user - trajectory ] ) of his trajectory , but also the equations of the trajectories of the emitters in the grid : @xmath28    eventually , the positioning system can be endowed with complementary devices .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the dynamic properties of the system , the emitters @xmath7 , @xmath8 could carry accelerometers and broadcast their acceleration @xmath29 , @xmath30 , meanwhile the users @xmath31 could be endowed with receivers able to read , in addition to the emitter positioning data , also the broadcast emitter accelerations @xmath32 .",
    "these new elements allow any user to know the acceleration scalar of the emitters : @xmath33    in some cases , it can be useful that the users generate their own data , carrying a clock to measure their proper time and/or an accelerometer to measure their proper acceleration @xmath34 .",
    "the user s clock allows any user to know his proper time function @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) and , consequently by using ( [ user - trajectory ] ) , to obtain the proper time parametrization of his trajectory : @xmath37 the user s accelerometer allows any user to know his proper acceleration scalar : @xmath38 thus , a relativistic positioning system may generate the _ user data _ : @xmath39    the emitter trajectories ( [ emitter - trajectories ] ) and the emitter accelerations ( [ emitter - accelerations ] ) do not depend on the user that receives them .",
    "thus , among the user data ( [ user - data ] ) we can distinguish besides the emitter positioning data @xmath40 , the _ emitter dynamical data _ @xmath32 , their union or _",
    "public data _ @xmath41 and the _ user proper data _ @xmath42 .",
    "the purpose of the ( relativistic ) theory of positioning systems is to develop the techniques necessary to determine the space - time metric as well as the dynamics of emitters and users by means of physical information carried by light signals .",
    "but in order to develop it in known space - times , it is useful to connect our emission coordinates to the usual coordinates in which these space - times have been already studied .",
    "we finish this section by summarizing the explicit obtaining of the emission coordinates from an arbitrary null coordinate system @xmath43 in a generic two - dimensional space - time @xcite .",
    "let us assume the _ proper time history of two emitters _ to be known in this coordinate system : @xmath44    we can introduce the proper times as coordinates @xmath15 by defining the transformation to the null system @xmath43 given by : @xmath45 thus , relations ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) define _ emission coordinates _ in the _ emission coordinate domains",
    "_ @xmath11 between both emitters .",
    "note that outside this region of domains the transformation ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) also determines null coordinates , but they are not emission coordinates , i.e. they can not be constructed by means of broadcast signals @xcite .",
    "in emission coordinates , the emitter trajectories take the expression : @xmath46 where , from ( [ principalemit ] ) and ( [ coordinatechange0 ] ) , the emitter trajectories @xmath47 are given by : @xmath48",
    "we consider here the positioning system defined by two non inertial stationary emitters @xmath7 , @xmath8 in absence of gravitation , that is to say , in minkowski plane ( two - dimensional flat space - time ) .",
    "thus , the emitters have a uniformly accelerated motion and they are at rest with respect to each other , i.e. the hyperbolic emitter trajectories have the same asymptotes ( these observers have been largely studied by rindler in @xcite )",
    ". then we can choose inertial null coordinates @xmath43 such that the trajectories of the emitters are [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : accelerated-1](a ) ] : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is the acceleration parameter of the emitter @xmath0 .",
    "it is known that the space - like half - straight lines cutting at the coordinate origin determine the locus of simultaneous events for both emitters .",
    "thus , we can define a synchronization of the emitter clocks by giving their proper times @xmath52 and @xmath53 at two simultaneous events . with this synchronization ,",

    "these parameters @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath52 and @xmath79 yield an operational definition of the null canonical inertial coordinates @xmath43 associated with the emitters , i.e. those with origin in the intersection of the null asymptotes of the stationary system to which the emitters belong .",

    "it is such a parameter ( say @xmath86 here ) that relations ( [ iii - acceleracions ] ) and ( [ iii - sigma ] ) leave free for given data parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath87      now , let us analyze the metric information that any user can obtain from the emitter positioning data .",

    "this statement shows that the sole public quantities @xmath92 received by any user allow him to know the space - time metric everywhere .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth remarking that , in order for a user to obtain this result , the user must be informed that _ the emitter positioning data come from a stationary positioning system in absence of gravitational fields_. otherwise , the above deduction based on the existence of the coordinate transformation ( [ iii - change - a ] ) would not be valid .",
    "remark also that this required information does not demand the specific value of the accelerations of the emitters , which may be also determined by the user by relations ( [ iii - acceleracions ] ) .",
    "the users may know that the system of the two emitter clocks is stationary by an _ a priori information _ , forming part of the dynamical characteristics of the positioning system and its foreseen control .",

    "@xcite )    in any case , the user information of the dynamics of the pair of clocks by any of these two methods is generically necessary , because _ emitter trajectories that are parallel straight lines in the grid are not necessarily uniformly accelerated trajectories in a flat space - time _ @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ section - iv ] we show that in a non flat space - time we can also find in the grid the same picture that fig .",
    "[ fig : accelerated-1](b ) .",
    "the considerations that follow in this section are qualitatively independent of the synchronization of the emitters .",
    "for this reason , we assume for the sake of simplicity the synchronization parameter to be zero , @xmath64 .",
    "all the above considerations are valid for any user @xmath31 which , as we have already said , can also obtain from the user positioning data @xmath25 his own trajectory in the grid .",
    "then , the expression ( [ iii - metric ] ) of the metric tensor allows him to calculate as usual his proper time lapse and acceleration in terms of the emitter positioning data @xmath93 .",
    "suppose now that a user obtains from these data the following trajectory : @xmath94 that is , a straight line parallel to the emitter trajectories [ see fig .",

    "it is worth remarking that the emitter positioning data received by a user give , in the two physically different two - dimensional minkowski and schwarzschild space - times , the same qualitative information about the emitter trajectories in the grid , as we have seen in this and the precedent section [ see figs .

    ", we shall see in the next section that complementary data that afford dynamic information of the system allow the user to distinguish between both systems .",
    "the relevance of the dynamical data for the determination of the system is manifest in the case of a geodesic user : his trajectory in the grid is different in both cases .",
    "is is easy to show this fact because the trajectory ( [ iii - user - geo ] ) of a geodesic user in the grid of the system in the flat case is not geodesic for the schwarzschild metric ( [ iv - metric - uv ] ) , as a straightforward calculation shows . in this last case the geodesics , qualitatively similar to those of the flat case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accelerated-3](b ) , have nevertheless a different trajectory equation . by comparison of this trajectory with the one constructed by the geodesic user from the received sole data @xmath182 , he is able to distinguish in which space - time he is evolving .",
    "the interest of auto - locating positioning systems in gravimetry has been pointed out in @xcite , where we have shown that , if a user has neither a priori information on the gravitational field nor on the positioning system , the user data determine the metric and its first derivatives along the user and emitter trajectories . in the next section",
    "we apply these results to obtain the gravitational information that can be extracted from the user data generated by the positioning systems of the precedent sections .",
    "but in some cases the user can have some a priori information about the space - time or about the kind of positioning system he is using . the different levels of not null information in these two aspects establishes different kinds of gravity problems .",
    "for example , in the last two precedent sections , we have supposed the space - time fully known ( minkowski or schwarzschild planes ) , and also the partial information on the positioning system assuring its stationarity , but without specifying the space - time trajectories of the emitters .    in this section we will consider other situations of total or partial information on the space - time itself and/or on the positioning system , and we will analyze the role that the emitter accelerations and the proper user data can play in obtaining the gravitational field and in recovering the complementary characteristics of the positioning system .",
    "we consider two levels in the a priori information that the user can have about the gravitational field .",
    "he may know generically that :    * ( gf-1 ) the space - time belongs to the family of schwarzschild planes expanded to include minkowski plane ,    or specifically that :    * ( gf-2 ) the space - time is a particular schwarzschild plane with a known the schwarzschild radius @xmath115 or it is minkowski plane .",
    "we also consider two levels in the a priori user information about the positioning system .",
    "he may know generically that :    * ( ps-1 ) the positioning system is defined by two stationary emitters ,    or specifically that :    * ( ps-2 ) the positioning system is defined by two particular stationary emitters with known radial coordinates @xmath134 and a fixed synchronization @xmath60 .",
    "if the user has the widest information ( gf-2 ) about the gravitational field and the widest information ( ps-2 ) about the positioning system , then , from ( gf-2 ) he can take a convenient coordinate system and express in it the metric components and from ( ps-2 ) he can describe in this coordinate system the trajectory of the emitters and the future light rays that spread from them . then , he may construct the emission coordinates and calculate the coordinate transformation relating them to the initial ones .",
    "consequently , he can evaluate the emitter trajectories and the space - time metric in emission coordinates .",
    "thus , without receiving any data , the user can know by calculation the pairs @xmath183 and @xmath184 locating the emitters as well as their dynamics .    with this full information about the metric and the positioning system ,",
    "a user receiving the user positioning data @xmath182 may extract his trajectory @xmath185 in the grid .",
    "moreover at every event @xmath186 on his trajectory , he may know the metric function @xmath187 and his acceleration .",
    "thus , in particular , the user may obtain his own units of time and distance .",
    "for example , in the particular case of a stationary user , his proper time is given by ( [ iv - user - tau ] ) .",
    "the situation in which a user has the widest information about the gravitational field ( gf-2 ) and partial information about the positioning system ( ps-1 ) is the one that has been analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "[ section - iii ] for minkowski plane and in sec .",
    "[ section - iv ] for schwarzschild plane .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the sole emitter positioning data @xmath40 complete the system information [ see statements [ iii - alfas - taus ] and [ iv - rhos - taus ] ] .",
    "moreover we have shown that the space - time metric may be obtained in terms of these data ( see statements [ iii - prop - metric ] and [ iv - prop - metric ] ) .",
    "once completed the system information in this way , the user is in the situation of the precedent subsection and , as commented there , he can also obtain his trajectory and his own units of time and distance .",
    "suppose now that the user has partial information ( gf-1 ) about the gravitational field and also partial information ( ps-1 ) about the positioning system .",
    "the user knows thus that the system is defined by stationary emitters and , consequently , that they have constant acceleration .",
    "if the emitters carry accelerometers and broadcast their accelerations , the user can receive the precise value @xmath29 @xmath30 of these accelerations .",
    "can this dynamical information determine the schwarzschild mass ?",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "furthermore , apart from the emitter positioning data @xmath40 , _ only one of the two accelerations _ is sufficient to the user to obtain the schwarzschild mass and , consequently , to acquire the information level considered in the precedent subsections .    in order to specify",
    "exactly this result let us assume firstly that the user knows the full set of the public data @xmath188 .",
    "we know that the data parameters @xmath189 depend on the emitter positioning data [ see ( [ iii - par - taus ] ) ] .",
    "because the accelerations @xmath50 are also known , the first expression in ( [ iv - pi - q - rhos ] ) and the the two in ( [ iv - accelerations ] ) constitute three relations in @xmath190 that allow to obtain them explicitly in terms of @xmath191 .",
    "on the other hand , the resulting expressions have to be compatible with the expression of @xmath59 given in ( [ iv - pi - q - sigma ] ) .    in the case of minkowski plane , the user data parameters @xmath192",
    "are submitted not to one but to two compatibility conditions , those given by ( [ iii - parametres - a ] ) .",
    "this fact and the considerations in the above paragraph lead to the following    [ prop - mass - accelerations ] consider a user of a stationary positioning system in a space - time of which he only knows that it is either a schwarzschild or minkowski plane .",

    "indeed , from ( [ iv - accelerations ] ) we obtain : @xmath204 this expression allows eliminate @xmath115 in the expression ( [ iv - pi - q - sigma ] ) of @xmath59 , which becomes : @xmath205 % \\label{theta - rhos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , substituting ( [ iv - rho2 ] ) in ( [ theta ] ) , ( [ q - alpha1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath206 this expression of @xmath207 is an effective function on @xmath208 consequently it admits an inverse : @xmath209 and we can state :    [ prop - mass - acceleration ] consider a user of a stationary positioning system in a space - time of which he only knows that it is a schwarzschild plane .",
    "let @xmath40 be the emitter positioning data that he receives and suppose that he also receives but one of the emitter dynamical data , say @xmath29 .",

    "let us assume again that the user has partial information ( gf-1 ) and ( ps-1 ) respectively about the gravitational field and the positioning system .",
    "we show here that if the user is stationary and generates his proper time , he can also obtain the schwarzschild mass .",
    "let us suppose that a user receiving the emitter positioning data @xmath40 carries a clock that measures his proper time @xmath149 and that he is stationary with respect to the stationary positioning system .",
    "remember that , from statement [ iii - prop - user - estat - acc ] , he knows that he is stationary if his trajectory in the grid is parallel to the trajectories of the stationary emitters and that this property may be extracted from the user positioning data he is receiving . from his trajectory in the grid , he may also extract by ( [ iv - user - a ] ) the value of the specific data parameter @xmath211 .    on the other hand , by comparing the user time @xmath149 with one of the received times ,",
    "say @xmath9 , the user can obtain the data parameter : @xmath212 this parameter relates the radial coordinates of the user and the emitter @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , from ( [ iv - lambda ] ) and ( [ iv - user - tau ] ) one obtains : @xmath213    then , from the second expression in ( [ iv - pi - q - sigma ] ) and relations ( [ iv - rho - bar ] ) and ( [ iv - user - tau ] ) we have : @xmath214 and substituting ( [ iv - rho2 ] ) and ( [ rouser - ro1 ] ) one obtains : @xmath215 this expression of @xmath216 is an effective function on @xmath155 .",

    "now we suppose that , in a schwarzschild or minkowski space - time , and in a stationary positioning system , we have a user which is unaware of these two facts , i.e. he has no information about the gravitational field and the positioning system .    we know that the emitter positioning data @xmath93 determine the user trajectory @xmath185 as well as the emitter trajectories @xmath222 in the grid , and that this happens whatever be the curvature of the two - dimensional space - time .    in @xcite we have studied the information that these data give about the space - time metric and we have shown that _ the emitter positioning data @xmath24 determine the space - time metric function along the emitter trajectories_. if in addition the user knows the emitter dynamical data @xmath32 , and consequently the acceleration scalars @xmath223 , @xmath224 , we have also shown in @xcite that _ the public data @xmath225 determine the gradient of the space - time metric function along the emitter trajectories_. we can apply the general explicit expressions given in @xcite and the results of the sections [ section - iii ] and [ section - iv ] to obtain the metric component and its gradient corresponding to the parallel straight lines emitter trajectories and constant accelerations broadcast by the stationary emitters .",

    "it follows that the compatibility restrictions ( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ restriction ] ) [ or ( [ restrictions - flat ] ) for minkowski plane ] are necessary but not sufficient conditions to characterize a stationary positioning system in schwarzschild planes . consequently , the user needs to receive complementary data or a priori information in order to obtain the gravitational field everywhere or to get the specific characteristics of the positioning system .    alternatively , even if the positioning system is not auto - locating ( broadcasting the sole proper times @xmath25 ) , when the user also knows the proper user data @xmath42 , he may obtain gravimetric information along his trajectory . indeed , from these data the user can obtain his parameterized proper time trajectory ( [ user - proper - time ] ) and his acceleration scalar @xmath229 . we have then shown in @xcite that _ the public - user data @xmath230 determine the space - time metric function and its gradient on the user trajectory_.    thus , applying the explicit expressions given in @xcite to the stationary user considered in the sections [ section - iii ] and [ section - iv ] , one has :    [ prop - along - user ] in a schwarzschild or minkowski space - time , and in a stationary positioning system , a user unaware of these two facts can obtain , from the user positioning data @xmath25 and the proper user data @xmath231 , the metric function and its gradient along the user trajectory : @xmath232 ( \\ln m),_1 ( \\tau ) = \\alpha \\frac{\\delta \\tau}{\\delta \\tau^1 }   \\ , \\quad ( \\ln m),_2 ( \\tau ) = - \\alpha \\frac{\\delta \\tau}{\\delta \\tau^2 } \\label{gradmetric - along - user}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the user data that give the metric ( [ metric - along - user ] ) and the metric gradient ( [ gradmetric - along - user ] ) along the user trajectory can be received by a non stationary user of other positioning systems and/or in other different space - times .",

    "the study of these two scenarios brings to light an interesting situation : the emitter positioning data of both systems lead to an identical emission grid .",
    "how a user can distinguish both systems ?",
    "we have analyzed this question in sec .",
    "[ section - gravimetry ] and have shown that the knowledge of complementary user data determines the schwarzschild mass ( statements [ prop - mass - accelerations ] , [ prop - mass - acceleration ] and [ prop - mass - time ] ) .",
    "these simple two - dimensional situations suggests that the relativistic positioning systems could be useful in four - dimensional gravimetry for reasonable parameterized models of the gravitational field .",
    "the gravimetry cases analyzed here are only particular situations of the general gravimetry problem in relativity where user data are the unique information that a user has .",
    "we showed in @xcite that these data allow the user to obtain the metric function and its gradient on emitter and on user trajectories . in sec .",
    "[ section - grav - along ] we have applied these results to obtain the gravitational information acquired by the user considered in sections [ section - iii ] and [ section - iv ] ( statements [ prop - along - emitters ] and [ prop - along - user ] ) .    finally , for a user that knows the space - time where he is immersed ( flat , schwarzschild , ... ) but he has no information about positioning system , we can ask the following questions .",
    "can the user data determine the characteristics of the positioning system ?",
    "can he obtain information on his local units of time and distance and his acceleration ?",
    "the answer to these questions is still an open problem for a generic space - time .",
    "but in a future paper @xcite we undertake this query for minkowski plane and we analyze the minimum set of data that determine all the user and system information .",
    "a remarkable result is that the user data are not independent quantities : the accelerations of the emitters and of the user along their trajectories are determined by the sole knowledge of the emitter positioning data and of the acceleration of only one of the emitters and only during the interval between the emission time of a signal by an emitter and its reception time after being reflected by the other emitter ."
