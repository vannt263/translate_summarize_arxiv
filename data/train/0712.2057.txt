    "the cycle of duration @xmath0 starts at @xmath1 by illuminating the motionless bec with the wave function @xmath2 with a splitting pulse from the two counterpropagating laser beams .",
    "this pulse acts like a diffraction grating splitting the initial bec cloud into two harmonics @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the atoms diffracted into the @xmath5 order absorb a photon from a laser beam with the momentum @xmath6 and re - emit it into the beam with the momentum @xmath7 acquiring the net momentum of @xmath8 .",

    "the harmonics propagate until the time @xmath16 and are subject to the action of the recombination optical pulse .",
    "after the recombination , the atoms in general populate all three harmonics @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
    "the relative population of the harmonics depend on the phase difference between the harmonics @xmath17 acquired during the interferometric cycle . by counting the number of atoms in each harmonic the phase difference can be determined .",

    "good contrast of the interference fringes was observed for cycle times not exceeding about 10  ms .",
    "this fact was theoretically explained by olshanii et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite attributed the loss of contrast to a distortion of the phase across each harmonic that was caused by both the atom - atom interactions and the residual potential along the waveguide .    a simple way to understand",
    "the reason for the loss of contrast is to consider the effect of the two forces acting on the harmonics @xmath17 during the interferometric cycle .",
    "the first force is due to a repulsive nonlinearity between the two bec clouds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ forces ]  ( a ) .",

    "the second force is exerted by the trapping potential along the waveguide and pushes the harmonics toward the center of the trap as shown in fig .",

    "the velocities of the harmonics are not equal to their initial values @xmath18 during the interferometric cycle .    , width=325 ]    consider , for example , the @xmath3 harmonic . just before the reflection pulse its velocity is @xmath19 .",
    "since the reflection pulse changes the speed of each harmonic by @xmath20 , just after the reflection pulse the velocity of the @xmath3 harmonic becomes @xmath21 . because of this fact , when the harmonic moves back to the center of the trap , its velocity before the recombination is not equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the change in the speeds of the harmonics during the first and the second halves of the interferometric cycle has two consequences .",
    "first , harmonics do not completely overlap at the nominal recombination time .",
    "second , the recombination optical pulse is unable to exactly cancel the harmonics velocities causing the recombined wave functions to have coordinate - dependent phases across the clouds .",
    "both mechanisms result in a washout of interference fringes and loss of contrast .    a modification of the single - pass interferometer interferometer shown in fig .  [ cartoon ]",

    "the interferometric cycle begins by illuminating the bec with a splitting pulse .",
    "the two harmonics freely propagate until the time @xmath23 when they are illuminated by a reflection pulse .",
    "they continue to freely propagate until the time @xmath24 when a second reflection pulse is applied .",
    "the harmonics freely propagate until the time @xmath25 when they overlap and are subject to the action of the recombination pulse .",
    "this type of an interferometer will be referred to as a double reflection interferometer . the coherence time demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite exceeded 44  ms .",
    "more recently , the coherence time of this interferometer has been extended to over 80  ms @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a double reflection interferometer over a the single reflection one is in that the shift in the velocity of the harmonics is considerably reduced allowing for larger cycle times . recently",
    "this type of interferometer was used to measure the ac stark shift @xcite .    along with the experimental realization of the single and double reflection interferometer , the authors of ref .",

    ", we use a simple analytic model to calculate the momentum and the degree of overlap of the two harmonics at the end of the cycle for both the single and double reflection interferometers .",
    "both of these depend on the time that the two harmonics spend overlapping , the total cycle time and the frequency of the trap .",
