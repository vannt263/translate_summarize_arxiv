    "it is now an established experimental fact that there are events with large rapidity gaps in the hadronic final state in which there is a large momentum transfer across the gap .",
    "such events have been observed at both the tevatron @xcite and hera @xcite in the rapidity gaps between jets process suggested for study by bjorken @xcite .",
    "the issue now for experimentalists and theorists alike is to address the question of what underlying dynamical process is responsible for such striking events .",
    "it is clear that conventional regge phenomenology can not provide an answer , since the soft pomeron contribution has died away at much lower @xmath4 values due to shrinkage .",
    "the two best developed models currently available are the bfkl pomeron @xcite , calculated within the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) by mueller and tang @xcite and implemented into the herwig monte carlo @xcite , and the soft colour rearrangement model @xcite .",
    "the recent gaps between jets analysis by the d0 collaboration @xcite favoured the soft colour model to the bfkl pomeron , although conclusions from gaps between jets measurements may be difficult to draw due to the uncertainties in the role of multiple interactions , which are poorly understood theoretically at the present time @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gaps between jets measurements at both hera and the tevatron are limited by the requirement that two jets are observed in the detector , severely restricting the accessible gap size . since the bfkl cross section is predicted to rise exponentially with @xmath5 , whilst soft colour is",
    "not , this is a severe restriction . at hera ,",
    "measurements of high @xmath4 vector meson production  @xcite have provided access to larger rapidity gaps in a well defined kinematic range , although the rate is low . with these issues in mind ,",
    "cox and forshaw @xcite suggested the study of the more inclusive double dissociative process @xmath0 at high @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we report the first measurement of this process , based on h1 data taken during 1996 .",
    "the photon and proton dissociative systems , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , are separated by finding the largest rapidity gap in the event ( the procedure used by the h1 collaboration in previous diffractive measurements @xcite ) .",
    "the process , shown schematically in figure [ diffplot ] , is considered in terms of the kinematic variables @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath2 are the 4-vectors of the photon , proton and x and y systems respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the @xmath10 center of mass energy and @xmath11 is the four momentum transfer across the rapidity gap . in this study",
    "we present measurements of the differential cross section @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the data for this analysis were collected with the h1 detector during the 1996 running period , when hera collided @xmath17 positrons with @xmath18 protons , with an integrated luminosity of 6.7 @xmath19 .",
    "photoproduction events were selected by detecting the scattered positron in the electron tagger , 33 m down the beam pipe in the scattered electron direction .",
    "this restricts the virtuality of the photon to @xmath20 gev@xmath21 .",
    "the reconstruction of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 system 4-vectors has been optimised by combining tracking and calorimeter information .",
    "techniques are applied to minimise the effects of detector noise .",
    "precise details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "losses in the forward and backward directions are , however , unavoidable , making the measurement of the invariant masses of the systems problematic . for this reason , we introduce the kinematic variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 , reconstructed using the expressions    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the proton and photon beam energies respectively , and the quantity @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is summed over all hadrons reconstructed backward ( forward ) of the largest rapidity gap in the event .",
    "this quantity has the property that it is insensitive to losses down the beam pipe , for which @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .    in order to ensure that",
    "the systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are clearly separated , only events with a rapidity gap between the two systems of at least 1.5 units of rapidity are selected .",
    "these events are specified by @xmath31 , and hence our sample is defined in the kinematic range @xmath32 and @xmath15 . and @xmath2 systems must be @xmath33 is not part of the hadron level cross section definition . any losses due to this cut",
    "are included in the acceptance corrections ]    the reconstruction of @xmath11 is more problematic .",
    "it is measured as the negative squared transverse momentum of the @xmath1 system , @xmath34 , and is sensitive to losses down the backward beam pipe , particularly for low values of @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason we choose to define our sample for @xmath35 .",
    "the events selected by the criteria described in section 2 are used to determine the cross section @xmath36 in the kinematic range defined in section 1 .",
    "the herwig monte carlo , including bfkl pomeron exchange , is used to correct for losses and migration effects in @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath11 . in the bfkl formalism at leading order",
    ", it does not make sense to run the coupling , and therefore @xmath37 is fixed in the herwig generation at @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds at leading order to a hard pomeron intercept of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the statistical error comes from the limited number of data events in the sample .",
    "systematic uncertainties are calculated on a bin by bin basis , and added in quadrature .",
    "the dominant error is due to the limited number of data events available to calculate the trigger efficiency , contributing a systematic error of approximately @xmath41 in each bin .",
    "the @xmath22 distribution , corrected for detector effects , is shown in figure [ xpom_fixw ] .",
    "the inner error bars are statistical and the outer error bars are the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the solid line is the prediction from the herwig generator for all non - singlet exchange photoproduction processes . a significant excess above the expectation from the standard photoproduction model is observed .",
    "the dashed line shows the herwig prediction with the lla bfkl prediction added .",
    "good agreement is observed in both normalisation and shape .",
    "care must be taken , however , in the interpretation of this result .",
    "there is a large theoretical uncertainty in the overall normalisation of the lla bfkl cross section prediction .",
    "the agreement in normalisation may well therefore be fortuitous .",
    "it should also be noted that the shape of the @xmath22 distribution in this region of phase space is not only determined by the underlying dynamics of the interaction , but also by kinematic effects .",
    "there is a kinematic limit on the lowest possible value of @xmath22 , set by the requirement that @xmath42 and @xmath43 gev , of @xmath44 x @xmath45 ( see equation ( 3 ) ) .",
    "this forces the cross section down in the lowest @xmath22 bin . the good agreement in shape with the bfkl monte carlo prediction , however , implies that the data are consistent with a value of @xmath46 within this model .    despite these limitations , however , with higher statistics the outlook for the future is promising .",
    "this measurement demonstrates that it is possible to extend greatly the reach in rapidity allowed by the gaps between jets approach . with the improved statistics already collected in the 1997 hera running period , and higher luminosity in the future , a much more precise determination of the dependence of the cross section on @xmath22 , i.e. the energy dependence , will be possible .      s.  abachi et al ( d0 collaboration ) , phys .",
