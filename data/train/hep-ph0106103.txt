    "as we know the higgs sector is one of the essential aspects of the standard model(sm ) @xcite@xcite , responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of masses for the fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "but until now the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking has not yet been directly tested by experiments . the extensions of the sm can lead to additional physical higgs bosons .",
    "particularly the general two - higgs - doublet model(thdm ) and the minimal supersymmetric model(mssm ) @xcite@xcite necessarily involve charged higgs bosons @xmath2 . because of its electrical charge , the charged higgs boson is noticeably different from neutral higgs particles .",
    "therefore , experimental discovery of higgs bosons including charged higgs bosons is one of the important goals of the present and future colliders .",
    "here we review briefly the production mechanisms for charged higgs bosons at hadron colliders for a comparison between the production mechanisms at lc and at the tev energy scale hadron colliders , at hadron colliders , there are several mechanisms which can produce charged higgs bosons@xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the charged higgs boson pair can be produced by @xmath3 @xcite and gluon - gluon fusions at one - loop @xmath4 @xcite at the lhc . since the heavy @xmath2-bosons decay dominantly into quark pairs , the pair production process is always accompanied by serious qcd backgrounds .",
    "( 2 ) when @xmath5 , the @xmath2 bosons can abundantly be produced in decays of top ( anti - top ) quarks @xmath6 from the parent production channel @xmath7 .",
    "the dominant decay channels in this mass range are @xmath8 .",
    "( 3 ) when @xmath9 , the single charged higgs boson production can be via @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11@xcite and @xmath12 processes @xcite .",
    "the sequential decay @xmath13 is known as a preferred channel for @xmath2 boson search . but",
    "signals in these processes appear together with large qcd background .",
    "the associated heavy @xmath2 production with @xmath14 boson is another important channel in production of the heavy @xmath2 bosons which has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this case",
    "the @xmath15-boson s leptonic decay may be used as a spectacular trigger .    in the future linear colliders ( lc )",
    "there are several mechanisms which can produce charged higgs bosons :    \\(1 ) pair production via @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the former has already been studied at the tree - level in ref.@xcite and one - loop order in refs .",
    "the latter production process is through laser back - scattered @xmath18 collisions and has been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that these two processes are prominent in discovery of the charged higgs bosons .",
    "\\(2 ) single production of charged higgs boson in association with @xmath14 gauge boson at @xmath1 colliders provides an attractive alternative in searching for @xmath2 , which is kinematically favored when @xmath19 exceeds @xmath20 . in ref.@xcite",
    "the associated production mechanism via direct @xmath1 collisions has been studied in the thdm . since there is no tree - level @xmath21 couplings @xmath22 and @xmath23 , both the @xmath24 assiociated production processes via @xmath18 and @xmath25 collisions have no tree - level contribution in the thdm and the mssm and occur at one - loop level in the lowest order .    in this paper",
    "we concentrated ourselves on the investigation of the process @xmath26 including the complete contributions in a non - susy thdm and the mssm at lc . since both the @xmath0 associated production processes via @xmath1 and laser back - scattered @xmath18",
    "collision modes are all one - loop induced at the lowest order , and from the technical point of view there is no problem in realizing the luminosity of laser back - scattered photon beam approching to that of electron beam , the production rate through @xmath18 collisions could be competitive with the @xmath1 colliding mode at lc .",
    "we arrange this paper as follows . in sec.2",
    "we present the analytical calculation . in sec.3",
    "we give some numerical presentations and discuss the numerical results of the processes @xmath27 .",
    "in frame of the mssm we do numerical calculation in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the conclusions are contained in sec.iv .",
    "finally some notations used in this paper and the explicit expressions of the self - energies are collected in the appendix .",
    "in this section we investigate the process @xmath29 in frames of a cp conserving non - susy thdm and mssm . in these models",
    "the cross section of @xmath30 coincides with the process @xmath31 because of the charge conjugation invariance .",
    "our calculation in this section is concentrated on the process @xmath32 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "but the numerical results of the total cross section in section iii involve both two processes i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "hence our numerical results of total cross section contain a factor of 2 in contrast to only @xmath34 production .    in our calculation",
    ", we adopt the t hooft - feynman gauge , and use dimension regularization scheme for the calculations in frame of the non - susy thdm and dimension reduction scheme in frame of the mssm .",
    "we denote the reaction of @xmath35 production via photon - photon collisions as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the four momenta of the incoming photons and outgoing @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "we depict the generic feynman diagrams contributing to the subprocess @xmath44 in fig.1 in the frame of the mssm . as shown in the figure , this is a one - loop induced subprocess . the diagrams with internal supersymmetric particles @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 do not appear in the non - susy thdm . in fig.1",
    "there are self - energy , triangle , box and quartic one - loop diagrams as well as the counter - term for the @xmath48 vertex appearing in t - channel .",
    "the corresponding u - channel diagrams are not shown in this figure .",
    "the existance of vertex counterterm is due to the fact that this vertex is absent at the tree level , but is uv - divergent at loop contributions .",
    "the @xmath48 vertex counter - term can be visualized in fig.1(b.1 ) , ( b.2 ) .",
    "as this subprocess involves non - diagonal gauge propagators , the loop diagrams in fig.1(a.1-a.19 ) and the one - loop diagrams in fig.1(b.3-b.5 ) are not uv - finite by themselves .",
    "both the mixing @xmath49 and @xmath50 propagators have to be renormalized to obtain finite physical results .",
    "the explicit self - energy one - loop diagrams for mixings of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are plotted in fig.2 . since the @xmath49 self - energy diagrams on the external @xmath14 boson have no contribution as a consequence of on - mass - shell @xmath14 gauge boson , we do not plot them on fig.1 . by using the renormalization condition as described in refs .",

    "it is obvious that the supersymmetric particles in loop can enhance the cross sections of the subprocess substantially by one order .",
    "when the ratio of the vacuum expectation values has a small value and the charged higgs boson mass is in the mediate range , the cross sections of the subprocess can reach @xmath157 femto barn .",

    "all these curves in fig.4a and fig.4b show that the cross section is a obviously effected by @xmath136 .",
    "that is because the couplings of higgs bosons to quark(squark ) pairs are related to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values .",
    "we can see from these figures that the dependence of the cross section on @xmath136 in the mssm is weaker than in the non - susy thdm and the maximal enhancement occurs at the low @xmath136 range .",
    "we compared our results in the non - susy thdm with those in ref.@xcite and find that the production rates via @xmath18 collision mode are of the same order as those via @xmath25 collision mode at lc .",

    "numerical analysis of their production rates is carried out at one - loop order with some typical parameter sets . with our input parameters ,",
    "the contributions from susy sector can lead to an order of magnitude enhancement of the cross section for the case of the thdm in some parameter space .",
    "our results demonstrate that this production rate via photon - photon collisions at lc can reach about 0.1 femto barn in frame of the mssm at lc when @xmath166 .",
