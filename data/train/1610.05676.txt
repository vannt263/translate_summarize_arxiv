    "the field of optical communications is one where quantum information may have its first promising applications , thanks to its somewhat easier technological requirements than , for example , computation .",
    "several theoretical works in the past have produced the ultimate bound on the transmission of classical information through a quantum channel , i.e. , the classical - quantum capacity , and demonstrated its achievability @xcite ; in particular , recently it has been shown that the classical - quantum capacity for gaussian channels , which are used to model the most common communication media , is achieved by a gaussian encoding @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there is still much work going on to achieve that capacity in practice @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that optimal decoding strategies involve joint measurements on long codewords of quantum states @xcite , which are difficult to implement with gaussian operations and photodetectors .",
    "a recent proposal by guha  @xcite , which we call the hadamard receiver , points in this direction , representing one of the first structured joint - detection receivers for optical communications , realizable in principle with current technology @xcite .",
    "this detection scheme relies on building a codebook ( hadamard code in the following ) of @xmath0 separable codewords of length @xmath0 from the binary coherent alphabet @xmath1 and transforming them at the receiver by a passive unitary gate @xmath2 represented by a hadamard matrix @xcite .",
    "the output is a pulse - position - modulation ( ppm ) code , which is easily read out by employing single - mode quantum state discrimination techniques , e.g. , photodetection . in the low - energy regime",
    "the scheme surpasses the information rate obtained by separable detection techniques , jointly reading out larger and larger codewords as the energy gets lower .",
    "further improvements can also be gained  @xcite by adding a second copy of the original hadamard codebook obtained from the latter by simply flipping the sign of the amplitudes of all the coherent states that form its codewords : the new vectors behave properly under the hadamard transformation @xmath2 , producing two ( phase - shifted ) copies of the initial ppm code which can be still read out by means of an adaptive dolinar receiver  @xcite .",
    "building up from these observations here we analyse in detail the case of a codebook formed by @xmath3 phase - shifted copies of the hadamard code ( the case @xmath4 corresponding to the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : we call this a phase - shift - keying ( psk ) hadamard code of order @xmath3 .",
    "first , by exploiting the symmetries of the problem , we compute the optimal information rate of this code , evaluating its associated holevo information .",
    "we show that , for all choices of the number of phase modulations @xmath5 and of the codewords length @xmath0 , the optimal rate saturates the classical capacity of the channel  @xcite in the low - energy region . accordingly in such regime",
    "the psk hadamard codes are optimal and any sub - performance resulting from their use is only a consequence of a lack of efficiency at the detection stage .",
    "next we compute the rates attainable when detecting psk hadamard codes with a modification of the hadamard receiver of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we dub psk hadamard receiver .",
    "it relies on the discrimination of multiple symmetric coherent states of fixed intensity  @xcite , applied to the ppm vectors that emerge from the hadamard transformation @xmath2 , operating on the transmitted elements of the psk hadamard code .",
    "the rate attainable by means of this technique saturates the optimal rate of the code at high energy , but it levels off at a plateau at low energy . comparing the results obtained for different values of @xmath3 we observe also that , while in the regime of low photon numbers @xmath4 appears to be the best choice , the use of more than two phases yields better performances in a crossover energy region where separable techniques start to perform worse than the one described in refs .",
    "@xcite ( the relative improvement being up to @xmath6 with respect to the @xmath4 case ) .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the formal definition of the psk hadamard code and its properties .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sechadcap ] we compute its associated optimal rate .",
    "the performances attainable by means of the psk hadamard receiver are presented instead in sec .",
    "[ sechadrate ] .",
    "the paper ends with sec .",
    "[ secconc ] , where we discuss our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "here we formalize the hadamard code proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and its @xmath3-phase generalization .",
    "suppose we want to transfer classical information through @xmath0 modes of the electromagnetic field , or @xmath0 distinct temporal pulses on a single field mode , traveling through a communication medium , e.g. , an optical fiber or free space  @xcite .",
    "the transmission line can be approximately represented by a phase - insensitive lossy bosonic channel of loss @xmath7 , which transforms the single - mode bosonic annihilation operator @xmath8 of the field as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the annihilation operator of the channel environment which is assumed to be in its vacuum state .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that , by imposing an upper bound @xmath11 on the average photon number that we are allowed to use per mode , the classical information capacity of this channel  @xcite can be achieved , in the limit of large @xmath0 , by means of codewords formed by products of coherent inputs whose amplitudes are sampled from a gaussian distribution centered in zero and with variance @xmath11 . ultimately this is possible because when we encode information in the optical coherent states of the field , @xmath12 , they reach the receiver end of the channel as attenuated versions @xmath13 , while keeping their original purity . since the net action of the channel on these states is a rescaling of energy by @xmath7 , we may take as a reference the _ received _ energy without loss of generality , which is equivalent to setting @xmath14 in the following .",
    "the practical use of the gaussian code described above is limited by the difficulty in implementing the optimal detection scheme that is able to read its codewords efficiently .",
    "this motivates the search for alternative ways of encoding classical messages into the channel which , while being possibly not as efficient as the gaussian one , will guarantee nevertheless better performances with readout strategies which are easier to implement .",
    "the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is one of such attempts . as in the gaussian case it employs sequences of coherent states as codewords . at variance with the latter however such sequences",
    "are selected by extracting elements from a binary coherent alphabet @xmath1 , with amplitude @xmath15 matching the average - energy constraint of the channel , i.e. @xmath16 . the number of different @xmath0-long strings one can generate this way is equal to @xmath17 ( specifically they are the vectors @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the state of the @xmath20-th communication mode ) . yet",
    "in constructing the hadamard code we only select @xmath0 specific ones of them by picking those sequences whose signs reproduce the columns of a hadamard matrix @xcite . for instance for @xmath21 the hadamard matrix , up to a normalization , is equal to @xmath22 $ ] : therefore from the set of four possible elements we select @xmath23 and @xmath24 as first and second codeword of our hadamard codebook . for arbitrary @xmath0",
    "we recall that a hadamard matrix of order @xmath25 with integer @xmath26 , is a @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 of elements @xmath29 which is orthogonal up to a scaling factor of @xmath30 and , for simplicity , symmetric ( a permutation of columns or rows is sufficient to satisfy this further requirement ) , i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xcite . such a matrix can be equivalently defined in terms of its elements as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bitwise scalar product of the binary representations of @xmath35 .",
    "then a hadamard code @xmath36 of length @xmath0 and average energy per mode @xmath37 comprises the @xmath0 codewords @xmath38 for all @xmath39 . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , this special set of states admits a passive unitary transformation @xmath40 , completely implementable through passive optical elements as beam splitters and phase shifters , that transforms the received codewords @xmath41 into equivalent ppm ones , i.e. , @xmath42 characterized by a single high - energy pulse on one of the @xmath0 available modes , the vector @xmath43 representing the vacuum state of the @xmath20-th mode ( see appendix  [ appa ] for more details on @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that the average received energy per mode @xmath11 is conserved by the transformation , although its total amount for @xmath0 modes is concentrated on a single pulse of energy @xmath44 , whose position varies from codeword to codeword .",
    "accordingly the classical messages encoded into the elements of @xmath36 can now be recovered by means of a readout strategy capable of detecting where such concentrated energy lies , e.g. photodetection or a dolinar receiver  @xcite aimed to discriminate the coherent state @xmath45 from the vacuum @xmath46 .    as already mentioned in the introduction , a refined version of the receiver proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite employs an enlarged code , obtained by adding those codewords @xmath47 with signs opposite to the ones in @xmath41 .",
    "more generally , we define a psk hadamard code of order @xmath3 by adding @xmath3 copies of the hadamard code , characterized by @xmath3 equally spaced phases of the amplitude @xmath15 , i.e. the set @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "such code is the collection of @xmath50 vectors @xmath51 with @xmath39 and @xmath52 .",
    "since the property holds for any @xmath53 , the elements of @xmath54 get transformed by @xmath40 in corresponding phase - shifted ppm codewords , i.e. the vectors @xmath55 as we shall discuss explicitly in sec .",
    "[ sechadrate ] , the readout of the input messages can benefit from this effect , the idea being to first determine the value of @xmath56 by checking in which of the @xmath0 modes the energy has been concentrated , and then determine @xmath57 by using a single - mode detection scheme to read out the phase of @xmath58 .",
    "in this section we compute the optimal communication rate @xmath59 of a psk hadamard code @xmath54 of order @xmath3 and average energy per mode @xmath60 .",
    "this is proportional to the holevo @xmath61-information @xcite of the code itself .",
    "more precisely defining @xmath62 the average state of the code , we are interested into the quantity @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & s(\\bar{\\rho})/n\\ ; , \\label{chirate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of a quantum state @xcite , and where the division by @xmath0 takes into account that we are interested in the amount of information which can be transferred _ per mode_. the quantity",
    "@xmath59 is the maximum rate of bits one can convey over the channel with the code @xmath54 with an optimal decoding procedure , e.g.  @xcite . to compute it we find it useful to exploit the unitary mapping  ( [ trans2 ] ) .",
    "accordingly the eigenvalues , and hence the entropy , of @xmath65 coincide with those of the density matrix @xmath66 with @xmath67    by construction the state @xmath68 has non - zero support only on a @xmath69-dimensional subspace of the whole hilbert space , spanned by the linearly independent states @xmath70 : we compute the entropy of @xmath68 by finding its spectrum in this subspace .",
    "we proceed in two steps : first , for all @xmath56 , we diagonalize @xmath71 , then we diagonalize the resulting multimode superposition , which turns out to be already partially diagonal .",
    "the first step has already been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , when computing the helstrom probability of discriminating the states @xmath72 ( see also sec .",
    "[ sechadrate ] ) .",
    "accordingly we can write @xmath73 where the eigenvectors @xmath74 are obtained by fourier transform of the original pulses @xmath75 and the eigenvalues @xmath76\\ ] ] depend on the fixed energy of the states , @xmath77 in our case .",
    "it is important to note that the eigenvectors @xmath78 for all allowed @xmath79 share the peculiar property of having a zero overlap with the vacuum state , i.e. , @xmath80 this is due to the fact that the overlap of any psk state with the vacuum depends only on its fixed energy and not on its specific phase , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "hence this overlap factors out of the sum in , which then amounts to a simple discrete fourier transform of a constant . replacing eq .",

    "most importantly , thanks to the property  ( [ over ] ) they turn out to be partially orthogonal , i.e. @xmath86 it is then advantageous to write @xmath87 as the sum of two operators , @xmath88 , with @xmath89 from eqs .",
    "( [ eoverlaps]-[rho+ ] ) we can deduce several facts : ( i ) @xmath90 , i.e. , the two operators are disjoint ; ( ii ) the set of states @xmath91 is an orthonormal basis of the space spanned by @xmath92 , of dimension @xmath93 ; ( iii ) @xmath94 is diagonal in this basis , with eigenvalues @xmath95 of multiplicity @xmath0 each . accordingly to determine the spectral structure of @xmath68 we have to diagonalize @xmath96 .",
    "this can be carried out by diagonalizing the gram matrix @xcite of the codewords @xmath97 , whose average state is proportional to @xmath96 itself .",

    "the latter property can be easily shown by inverting the definition of the basis states , i.e. , @xmath106 , and inserting it in to obtain @xmath107 in appendix  [ appa ] we report a detailed computation of the spectral decomposition of @xmath103 . for our purpose here , it is sufficient to say that the gram matrix is diagonalized by a unitary @xmath108 , i.e. , by the hadamard matrix of order @xmath0 , defined in sec .",

    "in this section we want to compute the rate of information transmitted per mode when reading out the psk hadamard code with the psk hadamard receiver . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the ultimate advantage of this code is the unitary equivalence between low - energy pulses distributed on several modes by the sender and high - energy ones concentrated on a single mode by the receiver , i.e. respectively the @xmath128 and @xmath129 states of eq .",

    "hence we repeat the initial procedure on the transmitted copy , sending it back to the beam splitter , measuring its reflected part on the photodetector and applying the same decision rule .",
    "note that we employ a beam splitter with rescaled reflectivity @xmath134 , so that the reflected part of the signal at this second step still carries a fraction @xmath135 of the input energy .",
    "we iterate this procedure of splitting the state and measuring its reflected part @xmath136 times , until either a click is registered at some iteration step , triggering psk detection on the remaining part of the state and the identification of a pulse , or the photodetector never clicks , in which case we guess that the received state was the vacuum . by properly rescaling the reflectivity at each step @xmath137 as @xmath138 , we can assure to always extract and measure a fraction @xmath135 of the input energy , so that after @xmath136 extractions , i.e. , no clicks , the energy is exhausted .    , @xmath52 or the vacuum , is sent through a beam splitter of reflectivity @xmath132 ( transmissivity @xmath133 ) and its reflected part is measured with an ideal on - off photodetector .",

    "we conclude that better low - energy , joint - detection receivers may be designed in the future by uniting the crucial ingredient of the hadamard one , i.e. , sending few information per mode , few codewords per number of modes , as allowed by the classical - quantum capacity at those energies , with more refined multi - mode detection techniques .",
