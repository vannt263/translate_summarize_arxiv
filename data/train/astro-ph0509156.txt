    "by now it has been well established that the x - ray emission from early - type galaxies has several components .",
    "these galaxies can roughly be grouped into two categories based on the ratio of the x - ray to optical luminosity @xmath1 : the x - ray bright galaxies which have large values of @xmath1 , and the x - ray faint galaxies which have small values of @xmath1 . in",
    "the x - ray bright elliptical and s0 galaxies , the x - ray emission is dominated by thermal emission from interstellar gas at a temperature of @xmath2 kev .",
    "the spectra of their x - ray faint counterparts tend to require two components : a soft thermal component with @xmath3 kev , and a hard component which has been fit as either thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath4 kev or a power - law ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ; allen , di matteo , & fabian 2000 ; blanton , sarazin , & irwin 2001 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the hard component varies roughly proportional to the optical luminosity , suggesting that the origin of this component is low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) similar to those seen in our own galaxy ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the modern x - ray observatories _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has allowed much of the hard component to be resolved into individual sources , thereby demonstrating that this hard component is indeed from individual sources ( e.g. , sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 , 2001 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of a _ xmm - newton _ observation of the x - ray bright elliptical galaxy ngc  4649 ( m60 ) .",
    "this is an e2 elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster .",

    "ngc  4647 was the host of the type - i supernova sn1979a ( barbon et al .",

    "we previously observed ngc  4649 with the acis s3 detector on the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( randall , sarazin , & irwin 2004 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we detected 165 discrete x - ray sources with fluxes determined at @xmath5 significance , most of which are likely to be low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) associated with ngc  4649 .",
    "the luminosity function of the resolved sources was fit by a broken power - law with a break luminosity of @xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "we argued that the break luminosity might separate black hole binaries ( at higher luminosities ) from predominantly neutron star binaries at lower luminosities .",
    "the cumulative x - ray spectrum of the resolved point sources was fit by a hard power - law model .",
    "the dominant x - ray emission from ngc  4649 is from diffuse hot gas .",
    "image showed several interesting possible structures in the x - ray gas , including radial `` fingers '' extending from the center of the galaxy .",
    "we suggested that these fingers , if confirmed , might be due to convective motions of the hot interstellar gas , as predicted in some simulations of elliptical galaxies ( kritsuk , bhringer , & mller 1998 ) .",
    "we also detected a 5  ( 0.41 kpc ) long `` bar '' feature at the center of the _ chandra _ image , which we suggested was due to a shock , perhaps driven by an undetected low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "subsequently , we observed ngc  4649 with _ xmm - newton_. the purposes of this observation included obtaining more detailed x - ray spectral information on the gas and x - ray binaries , and studying the structures in the hot ism .",
    "we adopt a distance for ngc  4649 of 16.8 mpc , based on the method of surface brightness fluctuations ( tonry et al .  2001 ) .",
    "this is the same distance assumed for out analysis of the _ chandra _ observation , and is consistent with the corrected recession velocity distance in faber et al .",

    "ngc  4649 was observed on 2001 january 2 for 53,867 s with the thin filter in place and with each epic instrument in full frame mode .",
    "the pointing was determined such that the galaxy was centered on the mos instruments so that it was not on a node boundary for these instruments .",
    "the analysis in this paper will be based on data from all three epic instruments : emos1 , emos2 , and epn . for the mos instruments ,",
    "only events with patterns 0 through 12 ( corresponding to single , double , triple , and quadruple pixel events ) were kept , and for the pn only patterns 0 through 4 ( for single and double pixel events ) were kept .",
    "we excluded bad pixels , pixels next to bad pixels , bad columns , and columns next to bad columns or chip node boundaries .",
    "the exposures for the mos and pn instruments were 51,348 s and 48,951 s respectively .    due to their high orbits , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ experience periods of high background ( `` background flares '' ) .",
    "an inspection of the binned light curves from each epic instrument showed that our data were affected by a few strong flares . to remove them , we first excluded periods most obviously affected by flares .",
    "the resulting data were further filtered such that only bins with counts within 2-@xmath8 of the mean were kept .",
    "this excluded periods of background flares and data drop - outs .",
    "the remaining exposure times were about 45,800 s and 40,800 s for the mos and pn instruments respectively .",
    "the pn camera is known to be susceptible to detecting a significant number of photons during the readout of the chip .",
    "these out - of - time events were clearly visible in the uncorrected raw image from the pn camera .",
    "fortunately , the science analysis software ( sas ) package provides the script epchain , which can be used to produce a statistical description of out - of - time events .",
    "the resulting out - of - time image was scaled by 6% , which is appropriate for full frame observing mode , and subtracted from the raw pn image .",
    "this appeared to remove all of the obvious artifacts associated with out - of - time events .",

    "thus , we believe that the absolute positions derived from the x - ray observations are typically accurate to within 3 .",

    "the images from the three epic cameras have been superimposed .",

    "is bright diffuse emission at the center of the galaxy , which swamps emission from discrete sources in that region .",
    "additionally , there appears to be a faint filament of diffuse emission extending from the northeast of ngc  4649 and curving to the east .",
    "this feature is discussed further in   [ sec : filament ] .    in order to image the fainter , more diffuse emission ,",
    "we adaptively smoothed the central region of figure  [ fig : xray_whole ] to a minimum signal - to - noise ratio of 3 per smoothing beam .",

    "the image was corrected for exposure and background .",
    "this image shows rather extended diffuse emission from ngc  4649 as well as the point sources .",
    "in addition to some extended features in the outer parts of the galaxy , the image appears to show faint radial `` fingers '' of emission reaching out from the center of ngc  4649 similar to those seen in the smoothed _",

    "[ sec : fingers ] .",
    "we opted to use the ciao wavelet detection program wavdetect to determine the discrete source population .",
    "sources were confirmed with a local cell detection algorithm implemented by the sas routine eboxdetect .",
    "source detection was performed in four energy bands : 0.31.0 kev , 1.02.0 kev , 2.012.0 kev , and 0.312.0 kev ; data from all cameras were used simultaneously to allow for the detection of faint sources .",
    "the detection significance threshold was set such that @xmath91 false source ( due to statistical fluctuations in the background ) would be detected .",
    "since wavedetect can not correct for _ xmm - newton s _ psf , the determined count rates were unreliable , although the detection process itself was unaffected .",
    "we therefore ran the sas routine emldetect on the source list generated by wavdetect , which uses a maximum - likelihood algorithm to determine source extent and count rate ( at the time , also allowing the source positions to vary was not supported ) and can properly account for the psf .",
    "thus , the final source fluxes have been corrected for exposure and the instrumental psf .",
    "we used the sas task esplinemap to generate background maps to be used by emldetect .",
    "this task removes specified source regions from the input image and performs a spline fit to the remaining data to interpolate across source regions and generate a background map .",
    "it should be noted that it was necessary to remove src .  1 from the list of sources to be cut out of the background , since this source is not a resolved source but a detection of the peak in the diffuse emission .",
    "masking this source when generating a background map caused the background to be significantly underestimated for regions just outside the region of the central source . additionally , we found it necessary to increase the minimum detection likelihood of sources that were removed from the background map above the typical value for the final source list .",
    "if the detection likelihood was set too low the background from the bright diffuse emission was undersampled , which caused the interpolated background map to underestimate this component of the background ( note that the _ xmm - newton _ psf is large compared to the scale of the radial brightness gradient of the diffuse galactic emission ) .",
    "the final source list was trimmed such that only sources whose fluxes were known to better than 3-@xmath8 in at least one energy band were kept .",
    "this technique resulted in 158 detected sources .",
    "blank - sky observations suggest that many of these sources are likely to be background sources unrelated to ngc  4649 ( hasinger et al.2001 ) . for the purposes of this paper",
    "we therefore limit the sources we consider to those within 328  ( 27 kpc ) , or 4 optical effective radii ( @xmath10 , van der marel 1991 ) of the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "table  [ tab : src ] lists the 47 sources contained within this region .",

    "columns 11 - 13 indicate which of the four energy bands ( soft , medium , hard , and total ) each source was detected in for each instrument , where a source is considered to be `` detected '' if the snr in that energy band is at least 3 .",

    "the statistical errors in the x - ray source positions are typically about @xmath151  ( 1-@xmath8 errors ) .    the detection limit in the full 0.3 - 12.0 kev band was about @xmath16 cnt s@xmath7 for @xmath17 .",
    "the detection limit was increased for @xmath18 ( 10 kpc ) due to the bright diffuse emission .",
    "this effect is obvious in table  [ tab : src ] , where no sources were detected within 66  ( 5.4 kpc ) of the center of ngc  4649 ( except src .  1 , which is not a resolved source but a detection of the peak in the diffuse emission ) .",
    "the count rates for the sources were converted into unabsorbed luminosities ( 0.312 kev ) assuming that all of the sources were at the distance of ngc  4649 , which we take to be 16.8 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "we adopted the best - fit _ xmm - newton _ x - ray spectrum of the resolved sources within the inner four effective radii ( table  [ tab : spectra ] below ) .",
    "the factor for converting the count rates ( 0.312.0 kev ) to luminosities depended on which instruments contributed to the count rates ( i.e. , in which epic cameras each source was visible ) . due to the relatively small number ( about 30 ) of sources available that were both likely to be associated with ngc  4649 and in a region of relatively faint diffuse emission",
    "we were unable to place useful constraints on the luminosity function of the sources .",
    "as noted above , there was only one source , src .  1 , detected within 66  of the center of ngc  4649 .",

    "this excess may be a combination of emission from the virgo cluster , the north polar spur , excess particle background , and/or unresolved background sources ( although we expect the blank sky background correction to largely account for any excess particle background and for unresolved background sources ) . to test for this excess we examined a region far from the center of ngc  4649 with sources removed from the region , using the blank sky data as background .",

    "we extracted the spectra for the diffuse emission from within three effective radii ( @xmath10 , 6.7 kpc ) of the center of ngc  4649 ( figure  [ fig : diffuse_spec ] ) , excluding all sources except src .  1 .",
    "strong emission lines are clearly present in the spectra that indicate that the emission is mainly thermal emission from hot interstellar gas , which is consistent with our previous results from _ chandra _ ( paper i ) .",
    "the initial fits to the diffuse emission simultaneously using data from each of the epic instruments gave large abundance values , as compared with _",
    ", with very large errors .",
    "further analysis showed that the results for the pn data gave larger abundance values as compared to the mos data , which were more consistent with _",
    "results . since we were unable to resolve these inconsistencies we omitted the pn data from all fits to the diffuse emission . removing the pn from fits to the source spectra",
    "did not significantly alter the results , presumably due to the lack of strong lines in these spectra .",
    "based on the line emitting spectra we first tried a single temperature mekal model .",
    "this did not provide an acceptable fit .",
    "in particular , there was a deficit of hard emission in the model for photon energies @xmath45 kev . since hard emission",
    "is expected from unresolved sources we added a power - law component to this model , which greatly improved the quality of the fit ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "the best fit photon index was @xmath46 , which agrees extremely well with the value found for the source spectral fits from _ chandra _ data .",
    "for simplicity the photon index was set equal to this value and frozen for all subsequent fits to the diffuse emission .",
    "as table  [ tab : spectra ] shows , the basic absorbed mekal plus power - law model still does not provide a statistically acceptable fit to the data .",
    "since previous work has found evidence for multiple temperature components and temperature gradients in this and other elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , buote 2002 ; paper i ) , we added a second mekal component to the previous model with the temperatures and normalizations allowed to vary and with the abundances of the two mekal components tied together .",
    "this provided a significantly improved fit , although it still was not very good .",
    "we also tried allowing the absorbing column to vary , but this did not improve the fit significantly .",
    "the two temperature model still did not provide a statistically good fit to the data ( chi - squared per degree of freedom @xmath47 ) .",
    "an examination of the residuals showed that much of the contribution to the chi - squared of the fit was coming from regions near emission lines .",
    "this suggested that the elemental abundances did not simply scale with solar , confirming the result of our _ chandra _ analysis .",
    "we therefore tried fitting the data with an absorbed vmekal plus power - law model .",
    "initially we allowed each abundance value to vary independently , save that of he which was set to solar . although most of the resulting abundances were very poorly constrained , their values suggested that the abundances could be divided into three groups : c , n , o , and ca ; ne through ar and ni ; and the third group being fe by itself .",
    "we tried various other groupings , including the best grouping found with the _ chandra _ data , but none of them provided as good a fit to the data .",
    "in particular , it seems necessary to allow iron to vary independently ; grouping it with other elements in general worsened the fit .",
    "although the grouped vmekal plus power - law model provided an improved fit to the data ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) it still did not give a statistically good fit .",
    "one possible cause of this is the large number of counts in the spectrum and relatively small statistical uncertainties .",
    "if the systematic errors are comparable to or larger than the statistical ones , then the @xmath33 of the fit may be increased . including a systematic error of 5% , which is roughly what is expected based on calibration analyses of the epic cameras ( kirsch 2003 ) , decreased @xmath48 from 1.36 to 1.03 while the best fit parameter values remained essentially unchanged .",
    "we believe that the systematic errors in the spectral calibration may well be on the order of 5% or larger , and thus can affect the @xmath33 values . on the other hand , they do not appear to have an significant effect on the spectral fit parameters .",
    "the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : diffuse_spec ] show particularly strong lines from s , si , and fe .",
    "we therefore determined the si / fe and s / fe ratios by fitting a modified vmekal model to the spectra .",
    "all other elemental abundances were allowed to vary freely , save that of he which was set to solar .",
    "the si / fe ratio is an indicator of what type of supernova ( sn ) explosions have enriched the diffuse gas .",
    "we find si / fe = 2.38@xmath49 and s / fe = 2.34@xmath50 .",
    "model calculations have found that for type ia sn the si / fe ratio is @xmath51 ( nomoto et al .  1984 ) , while observational studies of metal - poor galactic stars find that the average products of type ii sn have @xmath52-element abundances 2 - 3 times larger than the fe abundance ( e.g. , edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ; nissen et al .  1994 ; thielemann et al .",
    "we therefore conclude that the diffuse gas in ngc  4649 was most likely enriched by more by sn  ii than by sn  ia .",
    "the spectral properties of the diffuse emission as a function of radius were examined to search for radial temperature and abundance gradients in the gas .",
    "we divided the diffuse emission into concentric annuli centered on the galactic center such that each annulus had at least 3000 net counts per instrument and was at least 10  ( 0.81 kpc ) wide , and extracted spectra from each annulus ( with source regions subtracted ) .",
    "the annuli were required to be at least the 10  in width to avoid effects of _ xmm - newton s _ psf , which set the widths of the inner annuli .",
    "the resulting 9 annuli are defined in table  [ tab : proj_spec_grad ] ( emission from larger radii was dominated by the excess background emission discussed in   [ sec : spectra ] ) . for each model discussed in this section",
    "the photon index of the unresolved sources was fixed at @xmath46 .",
    "we first attempted to fit the observed spectra uncorrected for projection effects .",
    "we chose a simple mekal plus power - law model to simplify the comparison with the results from the deprojected spectra given in   [ sec : deproj ] .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : proj_spec_grad ] .",
    "the resulting temperature profile is consistent with our results from _ chandra _ observations ; the gas temperature is a bit hotter within the central 10 , drops to a minimum between 20 - 50  ( 1.6 - 4.1 kpc ) , and rises again in the outer regions .",
    "unfortunately , the abundance values are much too poorly constrained to allow detection of any radial variations , although one might note that the abundance of the outer annulus appears to be lower than that of any other .",
    "the large abundance errors are most likely due to the fact that much of the emission is in lines so that the continuum emission from h is faint , leading to large errors in the abundance ratios relative to hydrogen . in general ,",
    "the normalization factors for the mekal components are poorly constrained , which one would expect if this were the case .",
    "table  [ tab : proj_spec_grad ] also shows that , although some of the fits at larger radii are adequate , the fits to the central regions are not .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that when observing the central regions we must look through the outer regions , which will in general contaminate the spectra .",
    "fortunately , _ xmm - newton s _ large collecting area provided us with enough counts ( @xmath203000 per instrument per annulus ) to do a spectral deprojection to account for this effect . in the next section",
    "we describe the deprojection and give the results .",
    "we first fit the emission in the outermost annulus using the same mekal plus power - law model with galactic absorption as used for the projected annular fits .",
    "the best - fit values were then frozen and added to the fit for the next inner annulus , with the normalizations adjusted to account for geometric effects .",
    "the model component normalizations were fit and frozen independently for each camera since the different chip geometries lead to different fractional area covered by chip gaps for each camera in each annulus .",
    "we continued this process , fitting annuli and freezing the best fit values for the fit to the next annulus in , all the way to the center of the diffuse emission .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : deproj_spec_grad ] .",
    "the temperature profile is essentially the same as seen for the projected fits , with a slightly larger difference in temperatures between the hotter core and the cooler region just outside the core ( presumably because the deprojection has removed the influence from the gas in outer annuli ) .",
    "the @xmath48 s of the fits to the central three annuli are essentially unchanged .",
    "we conclude that while projection effects can noticeably influence our fitting results in the central region of ngc  4649 , it is unlikely that they are solely responsible for the poor quality of the fits in this region .",
    "as indicated in table  [ tab : deproj_spec_grad ] , the abundance values for the fourth and fifth annuli from the center were essentially undetermined .",
    "it is interesting to note that the projected _ chandra _ spectra show anomalously large abundance errors in the same region ( between 38 - 54 , or 3.1 - 4.4 kpc ) .",
    "it is possible that the spectra in this region are contaminated by some unresolved source that biases the abundance values .",
    "since the abundances were essential unconstrained , the best - fit temperatures were only very slightly affected by varying the abundances over a wide range of values .",
    "although it would be interesting to look at this region in more detail , for the purposes of this paper we simply conclude that the abundance values are undetermined and that the observed temperature gradient is not greatly affected by this uncertainty .",
    "we next tried different spectral models for the innermost annulus .",
    "the best - fit models for the total spectrum of the diffuse emission (   [ sec : diffuse_spec ] ) include several temperature components with a wider range of temperatures than seen in the deprojected annular spectra .",
    "this suggests that the gas may be locally multiphase in its thermal structure .",
    "thus , we first tried fitting the deprojected spectra of the innermost annulus with two mekal components with their abundances set equal .",
    "this provided only a slightly improved but still not ideal fit ( @xmath48 = 2.06 ) .",
    "as was also the case with the projected spectra , we found that much of the contribution to the @xmath48 of the fit originated from regions near lines , suggesting that the individual elemental abundances do not simply scale with solar .",
    "we therefore tried a vmekal model with the elements grouped in the same way as they were for the fits to the total diffuse emission (   [ sec : diffuse_spec ] ) .",
    "although this provided only an improved fit , with @xmath48 = 1.45 , it is still not a statistically good fit .",
    "we therefore tried a two - temperature vmekal model with tied abundances , thereby allowing for a two - phase ism with abundance values that do not scale with solar .",
    "the fit was somewhat improved , with @xmath48 = 1.29 .",
    "the best fit temperatures were 1.425@xmath53 and 0.741@xmath54 , while the best fit abundances were 0.0@xmath55 for c , n , o , and ca ; 2.7@xmath56 for ne , mg , si , s , ar , al , na , and ni ; and 1.4@xmath57 for fe .",
    "though this is still not an ideal fit in the statistical sense , we note that the fit statistic is only somewhat larger than that of the outermost annulus , where the projection effects are unimportant .",
    "furthermore , one might expect the goodness of the fit to be degraded since the models used for the innermost annuli to deproject the emission from the central region were statistically poor fits to the data .",
    "lastly , we tried adding a cooling flow component ( mkcflow ) to our models in lieu of a second mekal or vmekal component to model the cooler emission . adding this component only slightly improved the fit ( @xmath58 ) over the single temperature model , and the fit was inferior to that of the two - temperature vmekal model .",
    "we therefore conclude that the central emission is best modeled by a two - temperature thermally emitting gas with non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profile was determined by accumulating counts in circular annuli , excluding point sources , and correcting for both exposure and the blank sky background .",
    "we used 70 annular bins between 0 - 303defined such that each bin had @xmath59 net counts from each mos camera .",
    "this profile was deprojected to give the gas density profile , assuming that the temperature and abundance of the gas was uniform .",
    "the emissivity of the gas was derived from the mekal component of the best - fit mekal plus power - law spectral model for the total emission within 303 .",
    "the resulting electron number density profile is plotted in figure  [ fig : density ] .",
    "it is in reasonable agreement with the density profile derived by trinchieri , fabbiano , & kim ( 1997 ) using _ rosat - pspc _ observations .",
    "this procedure assumes that the spectrum of the gas ( i.e. , the abundance and temperature ) is the same everywhere .",
    "however , the density is only weakly dependent on the spectrum , and as tables  [ tab : proj_spec_grad ]  &  [ tab : deproj_spec_grad ] show the temperature and abundance do not vary greatly as a function of radius ( although some abundance values are poorly constrained )",
    ". therefore our results should not be strongly affected by this assumption .",
    "in our paper on a _ chandra _ observation of ngc  4649 we reported finding evidence for structure in the diffuse emission . specifically , we found faint radial `` fingers '' reaching out from the center of ngc  4649 , and a central x - ray bar , about 5  ( 0.41 kpc ) long , which appeared to coincide with 4.86 ghz radio emission . in this section",
    "we present additional results on these features provided by the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "additionally , we present evidence for a previously undetected feature , a faint filament of diffuse emission extending to the northeast from the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "the smoothed image of the core of ngc  4649 in figure  [ fig : fingers ] shows faint radial fingers of diffuse emission extending from the core .",
    "qualitatively , these features appear similar to those seen in the corresponding _",
    "chandra _ image , although they are somewhat less defined due to _ xmm - newton s _ relatively large psf .",
    "this similarity reinforces our previous conclusion that these structures represent real features , and are not an artifact of the telescope support structure . to check the statistical significance of these features , we defined a set of regions containing the most obvious fingers , as was done with _",
    "chandra_. the regions were slightly further from the center of ngc  4649 than the _",
    "chandra _ regions to minimize the impact of blurring the fingers by _ xmm - newton s _ psf .",
    "we considered only the raw data with _",
    "chandra _ source regions removed , unsmoothed and uncorrected for exposure , to ensure that the fingers were not an artifact of the smoothing process .",
    "for all analyses pertaining to the fingers we considered only data from the mos instruments .",
    "the pn data were not used since chip gaps , bad columns , and the out of time event correction would have complicated the analysis .",
    "we then compared the average surface brightness of these regions to that of other regions between the fingers at the same distance form the center of ngc  4649 .",
    "for the regions containing the fingers , we found on average ( 1.74@xmath150.04)@xmath60 counts s@xmath7 pix@xmath7 and ( 1.47@xmath150.03)@xmath60 counts s@xmath7 pix@xmath7 for the regions without fingers ( 1-@xmath8 errors ) .",
    "the excess of counts in the regions containing fingers was therefore significant at the 5.4 @xmath8 level .",
    "azimuthal brightness variations in the regions of the fingers had previously been detected in the _ chandra _ data . to test for these variations in the _ xmm - newton _ data we again divided up an annulus , ranging from 25  to 53  ( 2.0 - 4.3 kpc ) and centered on ngc  4649 , into 20 angular bins , excluding _",
    "chandra _ source regions .",
    "the data from the two mos instruments were combined to determine the total net flux per bin .",
    "an azimuthal plot of the net flux in each bin with 1-@xmath8 errors is given in figure  [ fig : azimuth_fingers ] .",
    "qualitatively this figure is similar to the analogous figure for _ chandra _ , though the fingers are somewhat broader , most likely due to the increased psf of _ xmm - newton_. additionally , the fingers are more significantly detected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ despite the increased psf since the larger collecting area and greater total counts provides a better snr .",
    "a @xmath33 significance test was performed comparing the net flux in each bin to the mean net flux per bin .",
    "we found a reduced @xmath33 of @xmath61 , which confirms our previous conclusion that the azimuthal brightness profile is not well - described by a constant and that the fingers are likely real features in the diffuse emission .    in our _ chandra _ analysis we compared the properties of the observed fingers to those produced in numerical hydrodynamical simulations of cooling flows in elliptical galaxies by kritsuk , bhringer , & mller ( 1998 ) .",
    "we now compare these fingers to those seen in more recent simulations by kritsuk , plewa , & mller ( 2001 , hereafter kpm ) , which implement a hybrid model that combines a subsonic peripheral cooling flow with an inner convective core .",
    "their simulations predict outflowing bubbles of hot gas , surrounded by inflowing gas that is significantly cooler than the outflowing gas at the same distance from the galactic center , and a temperature profile that is raised in the center , drops to a minimum at a few kiloparsecs , then rises again in the outer regions ( see their figure  7 ) .",
    "the shape of their predicted temperature profile qualitatively matches what we observe ( see table  [ tab : deproj_spec_grad ] ) , although kpm find that the temperature profile varies by a factor of two or more , whereas the variations we observe are on the order of 14% . to compare the temperatures of the inflowing and outflowing gas to those predicted by kpm we fit spectra accumulated from the sum of the finger regions and from the regions in between the fingers , using the same mekal plus power - law model used to fit the spectrum of the diffuse emission . as with _",
    "chandra _ , the abundances in these fits were fixed at 0.6 solar . if the abundances were allowed to vary the resulting values were unreasonably high and had large errors . the temperatures and",
    "@xmath33 s given by the fits were not significantly affected by fixing the abundance values .",
    "the results of these fits are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "the best - fit temperatures for the finger and off - finger regions closely matched those from fitting _ chandra _ data , with the finger regions being slightly hotter than the off - finger regions but consistent within the 90% confidence intervals ( difference is significant at the 2.1-@xmath8 level ) . in the kpm model , not only would would expect a larger temperature difference between the regions , but one would also expect the bright regions to be cooler than the darker regions , which is the opposite of what we find . although we might expect some scaling differences between our observations and the kpm simulations , we would expect at least the sign of the temperature difference between the finger and off - finger regions to be the same . we therefore conclude that while some form of convective instability may explain the fingers seen in ngc  4649 , the details are not reproduced by the kpm model .",
    "we previously detected a 5  ( 0.41 kpc ) long bar located at the central peak of the diffuse emission using _ chandra _ observations of ngc  4649 .",
    "unfortunately , this structure is too small to be resolved by _ xmm - newton_. however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : radial ] , _ xmm - newton s _ large collecting area provided us with enough counts to deproject the spectrum of the diffuse emission and obtain more accurate spectral models for the central emission .",
    "we used the best fit mekal plus power - law model for the central region defined in table  [ tab : deproj_spec_grad ] , applied the appropriate _ chandra _ response files , and renormalized the model until the number of net counts matched that detected for the x - ray bar by _",
    "( about 900 net counts ) .",
    "the resulting mekal component normalization was then used to calculate the cooling time of the x - ray bar .",
    "we assumed a prolate ellipsoid geometry for the bar with semi - axes of 1.35 , 1.35 , and 3.55  ( 0.11 kpc by 0.11 kpc by 0.29 kpc ) .",
    "the resulting integrated cooling time was about @xmath62 yr .",
    "we note that there is precedence for cooling times of @xmath63 yr in the central regions of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , bregman & athey 2004 ; lowenstein et al .",
    "this short cooling time suggests that the bar is a transient feature .",
    "one possible cause is accretion onto the central source detected by soldatenkov , vikhlinin , & pavlinsky ( 2003 ) , which they interpret as a quiescent supermassive black hole .",
    "figure  [ fig : xray_whole ] appears to show a faint filament extending from the northeast of ngc  4649 that curves to the east and extends from about 23 to 70 . to determine the statistical significance of this feature we compared the net counts ( 0.35.0 kev ) in a region containing the filament to those in identical rotated regions on either side of the filament , with source regions removed .",
    "we found an excess of counts in the filament region at a very high level of significance , suggesting that it may be a real feature .",
    "spectra of the filament and off - filament regions are shown in figure  [ fig : filament ] . since the filament spectra showed some emission lines we attempted to model the filament and off - filament spectra with an absorbed mekal model in the 0.35.0 kev range ( with absorption fixed at the galactic value ) .",
    "this provided a reasonable fit , with a lower temperature and higher abundance in the filament region as compared to the off - filament regions ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "however , the reduced @xmath33 s were high .",
    "an examination of the residuals showed that the model underestimated the hard emission for both the filament and off - filament regions . since we expect some contamination from point sources in the region ( potentially both galactic and background sources ) , we added a power - law component to the model , which provided a much improved fit . unfortunately , the resulting abundance values were unreasonably large and were essentially unconstrained .",
    "we therefore froze the abundance values at 60% solar , a value which we believe to be representative of the abundance in the outer regions of ngc  4649 ( see table  [ tab : proj_spec_grad ] ) .",
    "this fitted model is shown in figure  [ fig : filament ] for the filament and off - filament regions .",
    "the best - fit temperatures and their errors were essentially unaffected by freezing the abundance values .",
    "we conclude that the diffuse emitting gas in the region of the filament has a lower temperature than the surrounding gas and may also have a higher abundance ( though the latter is unclear ) .",
    "one potential worry with the above analysis is that the off - axis psf is large enough for a significant fraction of source counts to be outside the 18  radius source regions used to remove sources .",
    "since the filament contains more detected sources than the neighboring off - filament regions one might worry that the excess of counts on the filament was due solely to scattered source counts , though the clear presence of lines in the filament spectra as compared to the off - filament spectra would seem to argue against this interpretation . as a further test , we compared the fluxes from the power - law components of the filament and off - filament models and found that the flux from the off - filament component was larger by more than a factor of two .",
    "this suggests that the excess of counts in the region of the filament is not due mainly to sources , but to diffuse emission .",

    "both bright diffuse emission and point sources are detected , with the bright diffuse emission dominating the overall emission .",

    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission is reasonably well - described by a vmekal plus power - law model , where the elements are split into three abundance groups .",
    "this argues that the diffuse emission is a combination of emission from diffuse gas and unresolved lmxbs and that the elemental abundances of the combined diffuse emission do not simply scale from solar ratios .",
