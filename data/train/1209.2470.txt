    "in this paper we focus on the spectrum of thermal photons produced during the expansion of the fireball created in au+au collisions at @xmath2 gev .",
    "photons created in the interior of the fireball pass through it without any interaction , thus giving information on the properties of _ bulk _ nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "thermal photon spectra have been calculated within the framework of different fluid dynamics models @xcite as well as a hybrid kinetic - hydrodynamic model @xcite . here",
    "we employ a self - consistent chiral - hydrodynamic model combining second - order ( sot ) hydrodynamics and the linear @xmath0 model ( lsm ) , in which the temperature - dependent @xmath4 is computed from kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "we compare the spectrum of thermal photons with that obtained from the same sot with a lattice qcd - inspired equation of state ( eos ) and a temperature - independent value of @xmath4 .",
    "the latter model is commonly employed in the study of hadronic observables of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to quantify the differences in thermal photon spectra that arise from differences in these two fluid dynamical models when they are taken as a whole . in other words",
    ", no attempt is made to disentangle the impact of eos or the temperature dependence of @xmath4 on the thermal photon spectra ( see @xcite for a study along this line ) .",
    "we now describe the coupling between the chiral fields and the quark fluid , the latter described by second order boost invariant fluid dynamics ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the classical equations of motion of the lsm are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the fermi ",
    "dirac function and @xmath9 is the potential exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking . these are solved selfconsistently together with the conservation equations for the combined system of chiral fields plus quark fluid @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the comoving time derivative , @xmath13 is the spatial gradient , and @xmath14 is shear tensor .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath15 contains terms up to second order in velocity gradients and it is given in @xcite . in order to estimate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity @xmath16 in the lsm ,",
    "we adapt the method described in @xcite and employ the linearized boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation ( see @xcite ) .    to compute the spectrum of thermal photons created during the evolution of the fireball we consider the processes of compton scattering , @xmath17 annihilation and bremsstrahlung in the qgp phase , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the hadron phase @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "in all cases , the nonequilibrium distribution function of the quarks , @xmath21 , is calculated from grad s ansatz .",
    "we now go over to present our results . as a typical example of a conformal fluid we take @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponding to the supersymmetric super  yang  mills plasma .",
    "we use a 13 fm @xmath24 13 fm transverse plane , and set the impact parameter to @xmath25 fm . the initialization time is set to @xmath26 fm / c , and we use @xmath27 and @xmath28 as initial values .",
    "the initial energy density profile is obtained from glauber s model , with a temperature @xmath29 mev at the center of the fireball .",
    "we take @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] with @xmath32 fm as initial values for the chiral fields .",
    "we use the isothermal cooper - frye freeze  out prescription with a freeze - out temperature @xmath33 mev .",
    "the critical temperature is set to @xmath34 mev .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ cs ] shows the square of the speed of sound @xmath35 corresponding to the lsm with @xmath36 , which yields a smooth crossover , and to the eos calculated by laine and schrder @xcite which connects a high - order weak - coupling perturbative qcd calculation at high temperatures to a hadron resonance gas at low temperatures via an analytic crossover .",
    "recent works have shown that the comparison of hydrodynamic simulations with rhic data favor a smooth crossover over a first - order transition @xcite , and this is the reason for considering a crossover ( and not a first - order phase transition ) in the lsm .",
    "there is no appreciable change in the photon spectrum provided @xmath37 , but if @xmath38 or @xmath39 the dip in @xmath40 at @xmath41 becomes too sharp or fades away , respectively , resulting in a temperature dependence that strongly disagrees with the one obtained in lattice qcd calculations . as it can be seen from figure [ cs ] , for large temperatures the conformal limit @xmath42",
    "is reached , while for low values @xmath40 goes to zero .",
    "note also that the transition region is significantly broader in the lqcd eos than in the lsm .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ cs ] shows @xmath4 as a function of temperature for the lsm with @xmath36 .",
    "it is seen that the ratio remains small ( @xmath43 ) in the qgp phase and starts increasing abruptely for @xmath44 .",
    "for this reason we must impose a cut - off in the value of @xmath4 ; we take at which it is sensible to impose this cut - off can be estimated in @xmath45 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ]",
    "for the sot with the lqcd eos we consider a temperature - independent value @xmath47 , which corresponds to the averaged value throughout the evolution .",
    "figure [ qgp ] shows the different contributions to the total thermal photon spectrum coming from the qgp and the hadronic phases , for the lsm and the sot with the lattice qcd eos .",
    "it is seen that in all cases the photon spectrum is considerably smaller in the lsm , the difference being larger in the hadronic phase .",
    "the difference between the spectra in both models is practically independent of @xmath48 , except at very low values where the difference becomes slightly larger . in both models ,",
    "the contribution of the hadronic phase to the photon spectrum is dominant over that coming from the qgp phase .",
    "there are two reasons that make the spectrum obtained from the chiral model smaller than the corresponding to the lattice qcd eos .",
    "first , the hydrodynamic evolution is much faster in the lsm model , essentially because the speed of sound is on average larger than the one corresponding to the lattice qcd eos .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that the freeze - out temperature is reached in @xmath49 fm / c in the lsm and in @xmath50 fm / c , which represents a significant difference .",
    "the other reason is that the shear tensor is on average significantly smaller in the lsm , leading to a smaller contribution of dissipative effects to the total photon spectrum .",
    "using a simple self - consistent chiral - hydrodynamic model based on the linear @xmath0 model and @xmath1 conformal second - order hydrodynamics , we calculated the spectrum of thermal photons including nonequilibrium corrections produced during the evolution of the fireball created in au+au ultrarelativistic collisions .",
    "compared to the results obtained with a commonly used second - order fluid dynamic model with an equation of state inspired in lattice qcd and a temperature independent @xmath4 , we find that the photon production is significantly smaller in the chiral - hydrodynamic model , due to a faster evolution and to smaller dissipative corrections to the nonequilibrium distribution function .",
