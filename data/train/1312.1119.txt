    "in @xcite , it was calculated the sic - povm suitable for realizing the quantum tomography of a qutrit state .",
    "the states that generate the sic - povm elements are equidistant .",
    "they are nonorthogonal states @xmath1 for the inner product between any two equidistant states is equal to a complex number or its conjugate , which means @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath4 . moreover , when the inner product is real and positive ( equal to @xmath5 ) and the sum of the povm elements is equal to the identity we have a special type of povm : the so - called sic - povm . for one - qutrit state",
    "the nine measurement operators in the @xmath6 basis are @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath1 with @xmath8 is defined as : @xmath9 .",
    "this optimal sic - povm calculated for the one - qutrit quantum tomography can be used for implementing a minimum quantum state tomography of a bipartite two - qutrit system . for this case",
    "the povm needed for reconstructing the two - qutrit state is the set @xmath10 , @xmath11 generated by the above states and forming a set of 81 elements .",
    "notice that the povm set @xmath12 is not sic for the two - qutrit bipartite state system although is informationally complete .",
    "the experimental setup scheme is shown in fig . [ montagem ] .",
    "a 50 mw diode laser operating at 405 nm is used to pump a 2-mm - thick @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) crystal and generates , by type i spdc , degenerate non - collinear photon pairs .",
    "signal and idler ( @xmath15=810 nm ) beams pass through a @xmath16 plate ( half - wave plate ) before they cross a triple - slit placed perpendicular to the signal and idler beams direction .",
    "the triple - slit is placed at a distance of 250 mm from the crystal .",
    "the @xmath16 plate is used to rotate the photons linear polarization and is placed in front of a spatial light modulator ( slm ) because the modulation of the slm depends on polarization of the incident photon @xcite . considering the pump beam direction as the @xmath17-direction ,",
    "the triple - slit plane is in the @xmath18 plane with the smaller dimension in the @xmath19-direction .",
    "the slits s width are equal to 2a=100 @xmath20 m and are separated from each other by @xmath21 @xmath20 m .",
    "a 300 mm focal length lens @xmath22 , placed 50 mm before the crystal is used for focusing the pump beam at the triple - slit plane such that an entangled two - photon state in transverse path variables is generated after the triple - slit @xcite .",
    "let s assume the pump beam profile is narrow in the x - direction at the slits s plane such that it can be approximated by a delta function .",
    "the predicted photon pair state in this case is @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the photon path states provided by the slits , @xmath25 is a phase that depends on the path length difference between the slits and the crystal center , in our case @xmath25=1.94 rad , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to signal and idler , respectively @xcite .",
    "as it is shown theoretically in reference @xcite and measured in @xcite , the pump profile at the triple - slit plane determines the photons spatial correlation at the slits and therefore , the entanglement of the transmitted photon pair quantum state in path variables . pump beam transverse profile narrower than the slits separation at the triple slit plane is required for generating a maximum entangled state . in this condition signal and idler",
    "always cross opposite slits .",
    "the slm is positioned just behind the triple - slit , at 2.0 mm from it , for avoiding diffraction .",
    "signal and idler photons are reflected by the slm , returning through the slits s paths .",
    "the slm is a holoeye photonics lc - r 2500 ( reflecting type slm ) , which has 1024 x 768 pixel resolution ( each pixel consists in a 19 x 19 @xmath20 m square ) and it is controlled by a computer .",
    "polarizers , p@xmath28 and p@xmath29 , are placed just before the detectors because the slm adds path phase to the reflected photons and modifies their state polarization .",
    "the required photon modulation ( phase and amplitude ) is obtained by choosing specific slm grey scales and output polarizers rotation angles @xcite .",
    "two 200 mm focal length lenses , l@xmath30 and l@xmath31 , are placed at the focal distance from the detectors , to generate an interference pattern on the detectors planes . on the other hand , triple - slit image at the detectorsplane",
    "can be obtained by replacing l@xmath30 and l@xmath31 lenses by 125 mm focal length lenses , l@xmath32 and l@xmath33 , placed at distance 2f=250 mm after the triple - slit in the 2f-2f configuration .",
    "all measurements necessary to reconstruct the density operator @xmath34 are made in the fourier plane . by detecting at @xmath35 or @xmath36",
    "we are able to implement a positive operator that is proportional to the projector @xmath37 , with @xmath38 where @xmath39 rad .",
    "100 @xmath20 m single slits , s@xmath28 and s@xmath29 , are placed in front of the detectors .",
    "the smallest dimension , of each slit , is parallel to the corresponding x - direction .",
    "signal and idler beams were focused on the detectors with a microscope objective lens and two interference filters , centered at 810 nm , with 10 nm full width at half maximum , were kept before the objective lenses .",
    "pulses from the detectors are sent to a photon - counter and a coincidence detection setup with 5.0 ns resolving time .",

    "different polarizer rotation angles combined with specific grey scales introduce the necessary phase and attenuation to the photon paths @xcite .",
    "in the equations [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] were defined the povm @xmath44(@xmath45 ) which we use to reconstruct the two - qutrit density operator with the minimum number of measurements . to prepare the measurement operators",
    "we must be able to modify the state amplitude and phase of the photons transmitted by each slit .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the phase and amplitude modulation of this slm depend on input and output polarizers angle orientation .",
    "the liquid crystal display was divided into six regions , each with its own gray scale .",
    "each region corresponding to a slit .",
    "each region attenuates and/or adds phase to the photon path state defined by the slits . by adjusting the @xmath16 wave plate angle , and the angle orientation of the output polarizers , @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we are able to obtain the relative path modulation . to implement the measurement operators it was necessary to generate a phase difference of @xmath48 between any two slits and completely attenuate the third one ( eq . [ 1 ] and eq .",

    "[ ponto ] , we show experimentally that we are able to perform that kind of control .",
    "we substitute for a moment the triple - slit by a double - slit because it is easier to measure the spatial relative phase added by the slm with a double - slit than with a triple - slit interference pattern .",

    "therefore , we have all the necessary tools to implement the minimum two - qutrit tomography using the one - qutrit sic - povm .",
    "in order to prepare the transversal path entangled two - qutrit state , the pump beam was focused at the triple - slits plane , using the lens @xmath22 with 300 mm focal distance , as showed in fig.[montagem ] .",
    "triple - slit images were measured for testing the state preparation . like the previous image measurement ,",
    "the detector d@xmath29 was kept fixed at the image of one of the slits while the detector d@xmath28 was scanned in @xmath19 direction . at the fourier plane ,",
    "interference patterns were measured by scanning the detector @xmath59 while keeping @xmath60 fixed at @xmath35 mm and @xmath61 mm . this image correlation together with the measured conditional fringes in the interference patterns are entanglement signatures @xcite .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) show the states that construct the measurement operators @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "experimental implementation of these measurement operators requires to detect a photon that traveled through two different paths ( coming from slit j or k ) with a relative path phase difference of 2@xmath67 .",
    "this phase difference is added by the slm .",
    "the third path from a third slit not present in the measurement operator @xmath68 is eliminated by rotating the reflected photon polarization with a suitable gray scale at the slm and by `` blocking '' the photon with polarizers @xmath47 or @xmath46 .",
    "the path phase operation can be written as an unitary matrix @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a phase due the photon s path until each slit . adding this matrix to the povm we see that @xmath73 , @xmath74 still continues being a povm unitarily equivalent to the previous one .",
    "this @xmath72 phase was obtained by a theoretical fit of the conditional interference patterns with one of the photon paths attenuated .",
    "the obtained value is @xmath75 rad .",
    "@xmath76     + @xmath77    with the correct gray scales at the slm , that give us the desired attenuations / phases , we are able to implement the 81 measurement operators @xmath78 and we obtain the tomographic reconstruction of the state . signal and idler detectors were kept at @xmath79 in all measurements needed for the tomography reconstruction of the density operator .",

    "a relative phase appears between the remaining paths @xmath81 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the density operator is written in the two - qutrit logical bases , i.e. , @xmath82 ) are showed in equations ( [ rhoreal ] ) and ( [ rhoimag ] ) .",
    "moreover , figures ( [ rore ] ) and ( [ roima ] ) show the histograms of the real and imaginary parts of the density operator obtained .",
    "the peaks that appear in the histogram of imaginary part may be due to the gouy phase , a differing phase that modes of different order pick up on propagation .",
    "this longitudinal phase appears because of a non - optimal position between the fourier lenses @xmath83 and the detectors .",
    "similar behavior was observed in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above we measured the conditional images of the triple slit by coincidence detection between signal and idler slit images at the image plane @xcite .",
    "detector @xmath59 is scanned while detector @xmath60 is kept fixed at one of the three idler slit images .",
    "three plots of the coincidence counts in terms of the @xmath59 detector positions were made for the three fixed @xmath60 positions .",
    "the areas below the peaks in the graphs , corresponding to the photon path correlation after crossing the different slits , were calculated .",
    "these areas were normalized by dividing each one by the sum of the areas .    .normalized areas under the image curves and diagonal elements from the reconstructed density operator .

    "we see that the generated state is correlated , in a way that if the idler photon passes through one of the slits , the signal photon will pass through the symmetrically opposite one @xcite .",
    "we have checked the quality of the reconstructed density operator by comparing the theoretical state that we desired to generate ( eq . [ state ] ) with the expected values obtained from the measured density operator ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the fidelity of the measured @xmath34 with respect to the theoretically predicted state with a varying phase was calculated .",
    "we obtained a maximum value of 0.86 for a phase of @xmath25=0.58 rad different from the initially predicted @xmath25=1.94 rad .",
    "as mentioned above , this phase difference may be due a longitudinal phase that appears because of a non - optimal position between the fourier lenses ( @xmath56,@xmath56 ) and the detectors @xcite .",
    "we can also test the quality of the reconstructed density operator by comparing the predicted interference pattern @xmath85 using the tomographed @xmath84 for this calculation with the independent measured interference pattern at the fourier plane .",

    "the sum is over all slits @xmath93 . using",
    "the above equations we could obtain the interference pattern and finally compare with a measured interference pattern .",

    "in this work , we experimentally performed the two - qutrit minimum quantum state tomography using one - qutrit symmetric informationally complete positive operator - valued measure .",
    "this work was done by using two photonic qutrit states prepared in the transverse path degree of freedom when photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion cross a triple-slit.measurements for the tomography were made only performing changes in gray scales of the slm to provide phase shift and/or attenuation keeping the detectors fixed at the same position .",

    "<S> entanglement in the system is calculated via negativity and generalized robustness from the two - qutrit reconstructed density operator .    </S>",
    "<S> qudits or @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems have been the focus of an intensive research effort in the last decade because of possible applications and challenges in quantum information theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> higher dimensional quantum states are useful in quantum communications because more information can be encoded in only one system by using higher alphabets when compared with two - dimensional ones @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . quantum key distribution with @xmath0-dimensional quantum states can be safer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> maximally entangled qudits have been shown to produce violations of local realism stronger than maximally entangled qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generalized bell inequalities for qudits were found @xcite and their violation has been used as a test of entanglement for qudits systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum computation by using qudits has been proposed @xcite and quantum information tasks as cloning @xcite , entanglement concentration @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum game demonstration @xcite and quantum bit commitment protocol @xcite have been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> violation of local realism for qudits is shown to grow with the dimension d @xcite , and smaller quantum efficiency for the detectors are required for detection loophole free bell tests @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> qutrit states have been experimentally generated in several degrees of freedom of two photons such as polarization @xcite , orbital angular momenta @xcite , time - bin @xcite , and transversal path @xcite    in general manipulating ( or controlling ) higher dimensional quantum states is not a simple task because for many systems it is difficult to implement the necessary unitary transformations or the measurement operators . </S>",
    "<S> two important and particularly difficult problems are the assessment of the quality of experimentally generated higher dimensional quantum states and of the determination of the entanglement degree . </S>",
    "<S> a few works have measured entanglement witnesses for two qudits systems entangled in orbital angular momentum @xcite or transversal path @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an effective way to obtain information about a quantum system is to measure its density operator , i.e. , to perform the quantum state tomography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been used for measuring the density operator of photonic qudits in orbital angular momenta @xcite , time bin @xcite , and transversal path @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a drawback of this technique is the high number of measurements necessary for obtaining the density operator of the prepared state and the consequent increase of experimental error propagation when solving the set of equations necessary to obtain the elements of the density operator . in reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , they have made 14400 measurements for reconstruct the density operator of a two - qudit system ( d=8 ) , well above the minimum required number of measurements : 4096 . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes clear then that minimum quantum tomography schemes that produce an accurate reconstruction of the density operator are very important to characterize higher dimensional systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two optimal methods to perform quantum state tomography are the ones based on mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) and symmetric informationally complete positive operator - valued measure ( sic - povm ) . in the mubs case , </S>",
    "<S> bases have the property to be maximally incompatible . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> a state producing precise measurement results in one base produces maximally random results in all the others @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum tomography using this scheme was implemented in @xcite for the state reconstruction of photons entangled in the transversal momentum degree of freedom . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a sic - povm is composed of rank - one operators such that the product between any two of them is a constant number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mendendorp _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ performed a one - qutrit sic - povm , encoding the qutrit in polarization states of a photon with two spatial modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this last scheme is important for being part of a largest group of minimum measurements tomography schemes , specially useful in high dimensional systems as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> no sic - povm experimental tomographic characterization of high dimensional bipartite system , i. e. , two qudits entangled states , have been demonstrated . a recent experimental scheme for implementing sic - povm quantum tomography using multiport devices in path encoded qutrits </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed by n. m. tabia @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) is a natural source of correlated photon pairs and has been the most used photons source in quantum optics studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> photons generated by spdc are easy to manipulate @xcite and can be correlated in different degrees of freedom such as polarization @xcite , transversal @xcite , longitudinal @xcite and orbital momenta @xcite , energy - time @xcite , and time @xcite , or even in more than one degree of freedom when are prepared in hyper entangled states @xcite . to implement the sic - povm in the transversal path degree of freedom </S>",
    "<S> is necessary to have means of controlling the phases and amplitudes of the elements of the povm . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that this can be done by using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slm has been used for tomographic reconstruction of photonic states entangled in polarization @xcite , transversal @xcite and orbital angular momenta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the slm has been used to demonstrate a bell s inequality violation in photons prepared in orbital angular momentum state @xcite and minimum deutsch quantum algorithm @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a slm is used in this work to implement the sic - povm elements necessary to reconstruct the density operator of two photonic spatial qutrits . </S>",
    "<S> two qutrits entangled in transversal path are produced when two photons generated by spdc cross a triple - slit . </S>",
    "<S> sanchez _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ obtained analytically in @xcite , a specific sic - povm for odd dimensions . here , the experimental tomography of the photonic two - qutrit entangled state in transversal path using a one - qutrit sic - povm is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the density operator of the prepared entangled photons in spatial variables is obtained and the degree of entanglement of the two - qutrit system is calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : in section 1 , we give explicit expressions for states involved in sic - povm for qutrits . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are presented in section 2 . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the quality of the reconstructed density operator . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the predicted prepared state and the reconstructed one is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> a measured two - photon interference pattern is compared with the predicted interference pattern calculated from the reconstructed density operator . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement of the prepared two - qutrit system is also calculated from the obtained density operator for a different number of povm elements . </S>",
    "<S> this work ends with conclusions in section 4 . </S>"
