    "the observation of the pentaquark @xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) baryon @xcite in nuclear reactions induced by photons @xcite and kaons @xcite has prompted extensive theoretical studies on both its properties @xcite as well as production @xcite and decay mechanisms @xcite .",
    "although most models predict that @xmath9 has spin 1/2 and isospin 0 , their predictions on its parity vary widely . while the soliton model gives a positive parity and the lattice qcd study favors a negative parity , the quark model can give either positive or negative parities , depending on whether quarks are correlated or not .",
    "the parity of @xmath9 affects both the magnitude of its production cross section in these reactions and the photon asymmetry in photonucleon reactions . with a positive @xmath9 parity ,",
    "the production cross section is almost an order - of - magnitude larger than that for a negative parity @xmath9 as a result of a smaller @xmath13 coupling constant in the latter case @xcite .",
    "the positive parity also leads to a large positive photon asymmetry , which becomes negative if the @xmath9 parity is negative @xcite .",
    "there are other pentaquark baryons @xmath0",
    "( @xmath14 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) in the same antidecuplet as @xmath9 .",
    "although the @xmath16 has already been observed recently in p+p collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath17 gev by the na49 collaboration @xcite , its production in photonucleon reactions has not been studied . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the same hadronic model that was introduced for studying @xmath9 production in photonucleon reactions @xcite to study the production of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in these reactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ xi ]",
    ", we consider the reactions @xmath1 and @xmath18 for pentaquark @xmath19 and @xmath16 production , respectively , introduce the interaction lagrangians needed for evaluate their cross sections , and discuss the coupling constants and form factors at strong interaction vertices .",
    "results for the cross sections for these reactions are then shown and discussed in section [ results ] . in section [ summary ] , a brief summary is given . finally , the formula for evaluating the cross section for reactions involving two particles in the initial state and three particles in the final state is derived .",
    "production from the reaction @xmath1.,width=384,height=288 ]     production from the reaction @xmath3.,width=480,height=288 ]    possible reactions for pentaquark @xmath20 production in photon - nulceon reactions near threshold are @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "to evaluate their cross sections , we use the hadronic model introduced in refs.@xcite for studying @xmath9 production in photon - nucleon reactions .",
    "this model is a generalization of the su(3 ) flavor - invariant lagrangian for the interactions between octet pseudoscalar mesons and baryons @xcite to include the interactions of @xmath9 with nucleons and @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 .",
    "photon in this model is introduced as @xmath23(1 ) gauge particle , and the symmetry breaking effects are taken into account phenomenologically by using empirical hadron masses and coupling constants . in the present study ,",
    "we extend the model to include interactions among the pentaquark @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 or @xmath22 . since only three - point interactions appear in the interaction lagrangians , relevant feynman diagrams that contribute to these reactions are those shown in figs .",
    "[ diagram1 ] and [ diagram2 ] .",
    "the interaction lagrangians relevant for evaluating the amplitudes shown in figs .",

    "the pauli matrices are given by @xmath28 , while @xmath29 is an isopsin transition operator represented by a @xmath30 matrix with matrix elements given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 are diagonal charge operators , and @xmath35 denotes the antisymmetric tensor with the usual convention @xmath36 .    for the coupling constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 , their values can be related to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which has empirical values of @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 @xcite , by su(3 ) symmetry , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 if we use the ratio @xmath45 @xcite for the @xmath46 and @xmath47type interaction lagrangians between pseudoscalar mesons and baryons .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite , where the values for @xmath50 and @xmath51 have been determined in @xcite from the empirical @xmath6 and @xmath7 coupling constants using the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "since the sign of @xmath52 relative to @xmath53 and @xmath37 is not fix by the su(3 ) symmetry , we shall consider both signs for the coupling constant @xmath54 as well as the case of @xmath55 .    for photon coupling to nucleon",
    ", we include also its interaction with the anomalous magnetic moment of nucleons with empirical values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "since the anomalous magnetic moment of @xmath9 is not known , we neglect its coupling to photon .    the coupling constant @xmath58 denotes the photon anomalous parity interaction with kaons and has the dimension of inverse of energy .",

    "[ diagram1 ] or fig.[diagram2 ] are automatically taken into account by using different signs for the coupling constant @xmath11 .      with the above interaction lagrangians ,",
    "we can write the amplitudes for the five diagrams in fig.[diagram1 ] as follows : @xmath68 and those for the seven diagrams in fig.[diagram2 ] as @xmath69 in the above , @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote , respectively , the momenta of nucleon and photon in the initial states ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are , respectively , those of the kaon on the left , the cascade , and the kaon on the right in the final states of the feynman diagrams in figs . [ diagram1 ] and [ diagram2 ] . we have also introduced the following definitions : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .      to take into account the effects due to hadron internal structure , a form factor is introduced to each amplitude , and it is taken to have the following form @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are four momenta of the intermediate off - shell particles with masses @xmath81 and @xmath82 in each diagram , and @xmath83 is the cutoff parameter that characterizes the off - shell momentum above which hadron internal structure becomes important . since the amplitudes for diagram ( a ) and ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] for the reaction @xmath66 are individually gauge invariant , including form factors does not affect their gauge invariance .",
    "this is different for the amplitudes for diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) as only their sum is gauge invariant .",
    "using different form factors for these amplitudes thus leads to a violation of the gauge invariance . to recover the gauge invariance for the total amplitude , one can either drop the gauge violating terms in the amplitude @xcite or use an averaged form factor @xcite or other combinations of form factors @xcite for these terms . for simplicity , we use here a common form factor , which is given by the average of the original form factors for diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , for all these three diagrams .",
    "a similar consideration is applied to the diagrams in fig.[diagram2 ] for the reaction @xmath84 . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the form factors used in the present study : @xmath85\\nonumber\\\\ f_{(1e)}&=&f_{(2g)}=f(m_\\sigma , m_{k^*})\\nonumber\\\\ f_{(2b)}&=&f_{(2c)}=f_{(2d)}=f_{(2f)}\\nonumber\\\\          & = & \\frac{1}{4}[f(m_\\sigma , m_k)+f(m_\\sigma , m_\\sigma )          + f(m_\\sigma , m_{\\xi_5})+f(m_\\sigma , m_n)]\\nonumber\\\\ f_{(2e)}&=&f(m_\\sigma , m_n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts refer to the diagrams in figs.[diagram1 ] and [ diagram2 ] .",
    "the value of the cutoff parameter is taken to be @xmath86 gev , which is determined from fitting the measured cross section for charmed hadron production with three - body final states from photon - proton reactions at center - of - mass energy of 6 gev @xcite using a similar hadronic model based on su(4 ) flavor - invariant lagrangians with empirical hadron masses and coupling constants .",
    "this cutoff parameter is smaller than the value of 1.2 gev used in our previous study of the reaction @xmath87 @xcite , where the form factor is taken to be @xmath88 and the cutoff parameter was determined from fitting the cross section for charmed hadron production with two - body final states in photon - proton reactions .      as shown in the appendix ,",
    "the total cross section for these reactions can be expressed as @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 were defined after eq.([amp2 ] ) .",
    "we have also introduced by @xmath93 the momenta of initial - state particles in their center - of - mass system , and @xmath94 the momenta of final - state particles 4 and 5 in their center - of - mass system .",
    "the angles @xmath95 and @xmath96 are polar angles of the three - momentum of particle 4 in the center - of - mass system of particles 4 and 5 as shown in fig.[vector ] of the appendix .",
    "we first show in the upper panel of figs.[cross1 ] and [ cross2 ] the cross sections for the reactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 as functions of photon energy in the laboratory frame without including form factors at the strong interaction vertices .",
    "both cross sections are seen to increase rapidly with increasing photon energy .",
    "since the cross sections for the case of @xmath11=0 is between those with @xmath11=1.27 and @xmath11=-1.27 , the contribution from diagrams involving the coupling @xmath11 is less important than those involving the coupling @xmath97 . in the lower panels ,",
    "the cross sections with form factors are shown , and they are much smaller than those without form factors . depending on the value of the coupling constant @xmath11 , the cross section for the reaction @xmath66 has values of 0.03 - 0.6 nb at @xmath10 gev , while that for the reaction @xmath67 has values of 0.1 - 0.6 nb .",
    "we note that these values are significantly smaller that those predicted for @xmath9 production in photonucleon reactions using the same hadronic model @xcite .",
    "using a hadronic model that includes the coupling of pentaquark @xmath20 to usual @xmath24 and @xmath21 or @xmath22 , we have evaluated the cross sections for their production in the reactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 by assuming that @xmath20 has spin 1/2 and positive parity . using coupling constants related to those for pentaquark @xmath9 couplings to @xmath26 and @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and also including form factors at the strong interaction vertices with empirical cutoff parameters ,",
    "these cross sections are found in the range of 0.03 - 0.6 nb for @xmath66 and 0.1 - 0.6 nb for @xmath67 at photon energy @xmath10 gev .",
    "since the coupling constant @xmath53 is much smaller for a negative parity @xmath9 than for a positive parity one , the coupling constant @xmath97 also becomes smaller if @xmath20 has a negative parity . as a result , the cross sections for producing negative pentaquark @xmath19 and @xmath16 are much smaller than for positive ones as in the case of @xmath9 production .",
    "although the cross sections for photoproduction of pentaquark @xmath20 is an order of magnitude smaller than those for producing the @xmath9 in these reactions , measurements of @xmath20 production will be useful for understanding the properties of pentaquark baryons .",
    "this paper was based on work supported in part by the us national science foundation under grant no .",
    "phy-0098805 and the welch foundation under grant no . a-1358 .",
    "in this appendix , we describe the derivation of the cross section formula shown in eq.([cross ] ) for the reactions @xmath66 and @xmath67 involving two particles in the initial state and three particles in the final state , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "it essentially follows the method given in ref.@xcite .    in the center - of - mass frame of particles 1 and 2 , the cross section for such",
    "a reaction generally reads as @xmath99 with @xmath75 and @xmath93 denoting the momentum of initial particles in their center - of - mass system .      to evaluate the phase space integral in eq.([cs ] ) , we choose the coordinate system in the center - of - mass frame of particles 4 and 5 as shown in fig.[vector ] , in which the @xmath100-axis is along the three momentum @xmath101 of particle 2 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are in the @xmath104 plane . in terms of the angles shown in the figure ,",
    "the four momenta of these particle can be expressed as @xmath105    from four - momentum conservation and on - shell constraints , the following identities can be derived : @xmath106 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the two - body phase - space integral can be rewritten as @xmath107 where @xmath94 is the momentum of particle 4 or 5 in their center - of - mass frame .",
