    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) few - electron systems in strong magnetic fields have been the focus of extensive theoretical investigations in the last twenty years .",
    "@xcite many of these studies have used the jastrow - laughlin @xcite ( jl ) and composite - fermion @xcite ( cf ) wave functions , where the dynamics of electrons in extended fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems is governed by the so - called jastrow correlations .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the jl functions are exact eigenstates of the @xmath0-electron problem under high - magnetic fields for a special short - range interparticle repulsion . however , based on close - to - unity overlaps with exact numerical solutions @xcite of the coulomb problem for few - electron systems ( with @xmath2 ) , it is believed @xcite that the jl / cf functions should not differ significantly from the exact coulombic solutions .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on electron tunneling into the edges of a fqh system have found a current - voltage power law behavior , @xmath3 , with values for the exponent @xmath4 that are in conflict with the universal prediction @xmath5 derived from jastrow correlations .",
    "these findings motivated @xcite detailed exact diagonalization studies of fqh systems at the filling factor @xmath6 with up to @xmath7 electrons .",
    "these latest studies revealed that the long - range coulomb correlations lead to the formation of stripe - like oscillations in the radial electron densities ( ed s ) which are responsible @xcite for the observed unexpected behavior of the current - voltage power law .",
    "most importantly , the jl functions fail @xcite to capture these ed oscillations , _ in spite of having overlaps with the exact wave functions that are very close to unity_.    for the @xmath0-electron problem in strong magnetic fields and in the disk geometry ( case of quantum dots , qd s ) , we use in this paper a _",
    "microscopic _ many - body approach to derive analytic wave functions that capture the long - range correlations of the coulomb repulsion . to obtain analytic results ,",
    "we specifically consider the limit when the confining potential can be neglected compared to the confinement induced by the magnetic field .",
    "underlying our approach is a physical picture of a collectively rotating electron molecule ( rem ) and the synthesis of the states of the system consists of two steps : first the breaking of the rotational symmetry at the level of the single - determinantal _ unrestricted _ hartree - fock ( uhf ) approximation yields states representing electron molecules ( em s , or finite crystallites ) .",
    "subsequently the rotation of the electron molecule is described through restoration of the circular symmetry via post hartree - fock methods , and in particular projection techniques @xcite ( pt s ) .",
    "naturally , the restoration of symmetry goes beyond the mean - field and yields multi - determinantal wave functions .",
    "in contrast to the jl / cf functions , our analytic functions ( applicable for any @xmath0 and fractional filling ) yield oscillatory radial ed s in agreement with the exact solutions of the @xmath0-electron coulombic system ( see below ) .",
    "in general , the symmetry - broken uhf orbitals are determined numerically .",
    "@xcite however , in the case of an infinite 2d electron gas in strong magnetic fields , it has been found @xcite that such uhf orbitals can be approximated by analytic gaussian functions centered at different positions @xmath8 and forming an hexagonal wigner crystal ( each gaussian representing a localized electron ) .",
    "such displaced gaussians are written as ( here and in the following @xmath9 ) @xmath10 \\exp[-\\imath ( xy_j+yx_j)]~ , \\label{gaus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the phase factor is due to the gauge invariance .",
    "@xmath11 , and all lengths are in dimensionless units of @xmath12 with the magnetic length being @xmath13 .    in the case of a coulombic finite @xmath0-electron system , it has been found @xcite that the uhf orbitals arrange themselves in concentric rings forming em s ( referred to also as wigner molecules , wm s ) .",
    "@xcite the uhf results for the ring arrangements are in agreement with the molecular structures obtained via the conditional probability distributions ( cpd s , which can be extracted from exact numerical wave functions @xcite ) , as well as with those obtained @xcite for the equilibrium configurations of classical point charges in a 2d harmonic trap .",
    "@xcite    for an @xmath0-particle system ,",
    "the electrons are situated at the apexes of @xmath14 concentric regular polygons .",
    "the ensuing multi - ring structure is denoted by @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the position of the @xmath17-th electron on the @xmath18-th ring is given by @xmath19,\\;\\ ;   1 \\leq j \\leq n_q~. \\label{zj1}\\ ] ]    we expand now the displaced gaussian ( [ gaus ] ) over the darwin - fock single - particle states . due to the high magnetic field , only the single - particle states , @xmath20 of the lowest landau level are needed ( the angular momentum of this state is @xmath21 due to the definition @xmath11 ) then a straightforward calculation @xcite yields @xmath22 with @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "naturally , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since electrons in strong magnetic fields are fully polarized , only the space part of the many - body wave functions needs to be considered .",
    "@xcite the symmetry - broken uhf determinant , @xmath27 , describing the wm is constructed out of the localized wave functions @xmath28 . using ( [ uexp ] )",

    "@xcite the rotational symmetry by applying onto @xmath27 the following projection operator @xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36~ , \\label{amp}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xmath40 are partial angular momenta operators and values , respectively , associated with the @xmath18th ring , and @xmath41 are the eigenvalues of the total angular momentum .",
    "when applied onto @xmath27 , the projection operator @xmath42 acts as a product of kronecker deltas : from the unrestricted sum ( [ uhfde ] ) , it picks up only those terms having a given total angular momentum @xmath43 and a specific ordered partition of it into partial angular momenta associated with the concentric rings , i.e. , @xmath41 .",

    "the main conclusion is that the ed s of the rem functions exhibit @xcite a prominent oscillatory behavior in excellent agreement with the exact ed s .",

    "it has been found @xcite that the number of rings @xmath110 increases as the number of electrons grows . for @xmath111 , this results in electron - density oscillations that extend along the whole radius of the qd , with no obvious separation into bulk and edge regions .",
    "currently , the largest number of electrons for which the ring structure has been determined @xcite is @xmath112 with a concentric - ring arrangement of ( 1,6,12,18,23,25,34,37,37,37 ) .",

    "while we focus here on the strong magnetic - field regime , we note that the rem picture unifies the treatment of strongly correlated states of electrons in qd s over the whole magnetic - field range .",
    "@xcite finally , our rem wave functions , aimed here mainly at treating finite electron systems ( i.e. , qd s ) , can provide in the thermodynamic limit an alternative interpretation of the fqh effect ; namely , the observed hierarchy of fractional filling factors may be viewed as a signature originating from the magic angular momenta of rotating electron molecules .",
