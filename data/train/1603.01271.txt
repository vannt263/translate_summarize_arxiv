    "the pre - shock region ( region iii ) also includes an extended source with unknown nature ( ear2 in @xmath344.1 ) , which was excluded in the spectral analysis . for each region ,",
    "the spectra from individual observations were fitted simultaneously to an absorbed single temperature thermal emission model apec ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , after accounting for the background ( see dasadia et al .",
    "the spectra were fitted in the 0.5 - 7.0 kev energy band and the best - fit parameters were obtained by minimizing c - statistics defined in xspec .    the best - fit projected ( black ) and deprojected ( red ) temperatures are shown in figure 1c . a deprojection correction was applied by estimating the projection contribution of outer layers onto the inner ones .",
    "the layers were assumed to be spherical in the shape , which is a reasonable assumption for wedge shaped regions across fronts .",
    "the gas temperature beyond region iii , 2.5 kev , was estimated from the azimuthally averaged temperature profile of the cluster .",
    "for the deprojection analysis , we combined regions ii a & b. the best - fit density model was then multiplied by the corresponding temperature to obtain the electron pressure distribution in figure 1d .",
    "region i contains gas at a temperature of 8.2@xmath35 kev and abundance of 0.3 @xmath1 0.1 @xmath36 . across the inner edge ( c1 ) , the surface brightness drop is accompanied by an increase in the temperature .",
    "region ii contains the hottest gas in the cluster with an average temperature of @xmath14 11 kev .",
    "the best - fit temperature in region iib is 11.3@xmath37 kev .",
    "the abundance in region iib is poorly constrained .",

    "we combine regions ii a & b to obtain postshock temperature of @xmath39 = 11.0@xmath40 kev .",
    "the preshock temperature from region iii is @xmath41 = 3.2 @xmath1 1.1 kev .",
    "thus , the temperature jumps across the shock front by a factor of 3.8 @xmath1 1.3 , which corresponds to a mach number @xmath42 = 3.0 @xmath1 0.6 . the mach number after applying deprojection correction is @xmath43 = 3.2 @xmath1 0.7 .",
    "this is consistent with the mach number derived from the density jump .",
    "the preshock sound speed is @xmath44 = ( 9.1 @xmath1 0.1 ) @xmath3 10@xmath45 km sec@xmath5 , giving a shock speed of @xmath46 = ( 2.7 @xmath1 0.7 ) @xmath3 10@xmath4 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity of the cold disrupted cloud can also be estimated from the pressure ratio between just inside the cold cloud and the free stream , assuming a uniform flow of gas around a blunt body .",
    "while this is a good approximation for simple mergers , it may not be true for complex mergers like in a665 .",
    "for example , the shock is separated from the cold front by @xmath14 600 kpc , which is much larger than expected for a steady - state situation . also , in models of cluster mergers after the first core passage , the subcluster core is slowed by gravity and drag and falls back into the central region of the merged cluster , while the shock speeds up towards the cluster outskirt by following a negative pressure gradient .",
    "the obvious interpretation of the data is that the cluster is experiencing a two - body merger .",
    "a study on cluster dynamics of a665 done by ghb00 concluded that the velocity distribution is similar to a fairly relaxed and massive cluster and detected  only marginal evidence for substructure and non - gaussianity in the velocity distribution \" .",
    "this may imply that the merger is occurring nearly in the plane of sky .",
    "the @xmath47-body simulation by ghb00 suggests that the observed velocity dispersion is consistent with a merger between two similar sized subclusters caught in the middle .",
    "the x - ray data reveal one core while the other core may have been disrupted by the merger .",
    "elongation of the x - ray peak suggests that the merger axis is close to n - s. the infalling subcluster core is moving south and is being stripped by ram pressure .",
    "the surface brightness edge ahead the remnant core is a cold front ( c2 ) formed by the head - on merger .",
    "previously , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* o09 hereafter ) argued that the southern edge ( c2 ) in abell 665 is more likely a shock .",
    "o09 fitted the spectrum for the cold front using a region which extended beyond the cold front . in any case , the errors on the spectral parameters in o09 allow for either a shock or a cold front . from our new data ,",
    "we find that the temperature increases by a factor of @xmath14 1.3 ( from @xmath48 kev to @xmath49 kev ) across c2 which confirms it is a cold front ( figure 1f ) .",
    "the surface brightness distribution derived for sector s ( figure 1e ) shows no slope change outside of c2 .",
    "however , the relatively high temperature ahead of c2 may imply a shock heated region there ( as suggested in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the current  data do not allow a good constraint on the temperature beyond sector s.    we derived the abundance map of the cluster , which is nearly flat at @xmath14 0.2 @xmath36 .",
    "the core of the subcluster shows no abundance enhancement .",
    "this is in contrast to merging clusters with strong cool cores .",
    "for example , in a2146 , the abundance at the subcluster core ( @xmath14 0.9 @xmath36 ) is much higher than elsewhere at @xmath14 0.4 @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "similarly , in @xmath50 there is a clear abundance difference between two merger components @xcite . on the other hand , a665 s core is at most a weak cool core , with a central entropy of @xmath14 135 kev @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the more diffuse merger component can be seen in the north with an upstream cold front ( c1 ) .",
    "c1 has a large radius of curvature , @xmath52 @xmath14 750 kpc .",
    "the edge appears sharper in the east and can be traced over a distance of @xmath14 850 kpc .",
    "the distance between the stagnation point and the closest point on the shock ( s1 ) , also known as ",
    "stand - off \" distance @xmath53 , is @xmath14 600 kpc .",
    "this is the largest among all merging clusters e.g. , in the case of the bullet cluster , stand - off distance is @xmath14 138 kpc @xcite while in a754 it is approximately @xmath14 160 kpc @xcite .",
    "the shock has an almost flat shape and is visible over a distance of @xmath14 1.2 mpc .",
    "this is similar to the shock length @xmath14 1.1 mpc in the merging cluster a520 @xcite .",
    "however , in a520 the stand - off distance is only 50 kpc .",
    "two substructures ( ear1 & ear2 ) on the north of the cluster have been observed ( figure 1a ) .",
    "ear1 is located @xmath14 1.5 mpc from the cluster center and the faint galaxies within it have no redshift information .",
    "if ear1 is an isolated system , its redshift range can be estimated from the @xmath54 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the allowed @xmath55 range is 0.5 - 0.9 with a system temperature of @xmath14 4 kev .",
    "ear2 is located @xmath14 330 kpc north of s1 and contains two galaxies at the cluster redshift .",
    "the allowed @xmath55 range of ear2 , from the @xmath54 relation , is 0.1 - 0.3 .",
    "thus , ear2 is likely another subcluster associated with a665 .",
    "ear2 was excluded in our analysis for the pre - shock region .",
    "a665 contains a giant radio halo ( rh ) which is about 1.8 mpc in size @xcite .",
    "recent vla observations show that the rh is elongated in the se - nw direction .",
    "it appears that the radio emission is asymmetric with respect to the cluster center , being brighter and more extended towards nw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral index map of the radio halo produced by @xcite shows that the radio spectrum near the x - ray shock is flatter than that in the southern region , which may be consistent with the recent shock acceleration observed .",
    "there is some radio emission close to s1 . after removing the contribution from several point sources using multi - resolution radio data ,",
    "the flux associated with the diffuse region near the x - ray shock is @xmath56 mjy , although the source subtraction is uncertain and the presence of this emission needs confirmation with deeper observations .",
    "x - ray shock fronts often exhibit a corresponding sharp feature in the radio synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the relatively strong ( @xmath57 ) shock front that we observe in a665 does not exhibit a prominent radio relic , as do some other shocks with similar or lower mach numbers , such as a521 ( @xmath58 ; * ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a3667 ( @xmath60 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the eastern shock in the bullet cluster ( @xmath61 ; * ? ? ?",
    "it also does not exhibit ( at least with the present radio sensitivity ) an abrupt edge of the giant halo at the shock , as observed , e.g. , at the western shock in the bullet cluster ( @xmath57 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a520 ( @xmath62 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coma ( @xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a665 appears similar to a2034 ( @xmath59 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in that they both exhibit only hints of diffuse radio emission in the post - shock region .",
    "some other shocks clearly visible in x - rays do not show any radio emission  e.g. , the two @xmath64 fronts in a2146 @xcite .",
    "radio relics are believed to be produced by diffusive acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons on shock fronts ( most likely starting with aged relativistic electron population rather than thermal electrons , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but the above examples show that it occurs on some shocks but not others , apparently unrelated to the mach number .",
    "this may be explained by different density of seed electrons available for re - acceleration at the shock locations  relics occur only when a shock front crosses a cloud with an excess of such electrons , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "in other locations , shocks either do not produce detectable radio emission , or produce only a faint edge of a giant halo , within which the merger turbulence takes over and provides re - acceleration needed to sustain the halo .",
    "deep  observations of a665 have revealed complex substructures , including the detection of a new strong shock with a mach number of 3.0 @xmath1 0.6 and at least two cold fronts .",
    "the shock propagates in front of the cooler gas , apparently a remnant of a dense core which may have been disrupted by the merger .",
    "the shock front can be traced to @xmath14 1.2 mpc in length and has a velocity of 2.7 @xmath1 0.7 @xmath3 10@xmath4 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "the system exhibits a unique merger geometry , e.g. , the distance between the shock and the stagnation point of a cold front , @xmath14 600 kpc , is largest among all merger shocks .",
    "this provides an excellent opportunity to study shock heating mechanism , although this will require deeper x - ray data .",
    "we also rule out the prominent southern edge as a shock , as suggested previously ; it is in fact a cold front .",
    "the cluster hosts a giant ( @xmath14 1.8 mpc in size ) radio halo which appears to extend south of cold front ( c2 ) .",
    "there is a radio extension towards the northern shock .",
    "however , given the contamination of discrete sources located near the shock location , the spatial correlation between the x - ray shock and the diffuse radio emission must be taken with caution .",
    "mass distribution in a665 , constrained from lensing , would be important to understand the dynamics in a665 .",
    "the early result by @xcite suggested an offset of the x - ray peak from the galaxy distribution , which needs to be better studied .",
    "the support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through  awards go2 - 13160a and go2 - 13102a issued by the  x - ray observatory center which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for and on behalf of the nasa under contract nas8 - 03060 ."
