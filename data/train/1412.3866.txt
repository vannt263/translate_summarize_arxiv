    "dust enrichment has a large impact on the evolution of galaxies in various aspects .",
    "dust grains induce the formation of molecular gas through dust surface reaction of some molecular species , especially h@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust also affects the typical stellar mass or the initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite as dust cooling induces fragmentation of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "moreover , dust grains absorb optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) stellar light and reprocess it into infrared bands , dramatically affecting the observed galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiencies of the above processes are mostly proportional to the total dust amount ( or abundance ) in the system .",
    "besides the total dust amount , dust properties constitute another important aspect in dust evolution . among them , the grain size distribution is of particular importance since the optical properties such as extinction curves and grain - surface chemical reaction rates are directly modified if the grain size distribution changes . in other words , even if we precisely modeled the evolution of total dust amount in a system , lack of knowledge of the grain size distribution would cause large uncertainties in optical and chemical characteristics of the system . moreover , as shown below , the grain size distribution also affects the evolution of the total dust amount ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , it is crucial to model the total dust amount and the dust properties ( especially the grain size distribution ) at the same time .    recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a13 ) have constructed a full framework of treating the evolution of grain size distribution over the entire galaxy evolution .",
    "their calculations suggest the following evolutionary features of grain size distribution . at the early stage of galaxy evolution ,",
    "when the system is metal - poor , the dust is predominantly supplied from core - collapse supernovae ( simply referred to as sne ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "if the system reaches a metallicity level referred to as the critical metallicity , shattering produces a large amount of small grains , which eventually grow by accreting gas - phase metals in the dense interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this accretion becomes the dominant mechanism of grain mass increase at metallicities beyond the critical metallicity .",
    "after that , coagulation in dense clouds pushes the small grains towards larger sizes .",
    "the evolution of extinction curves is also investigated by @xcite using the evolution models of grain size distribution in a13 .",
    "the importance of including dust in cosmological galaxy evolution models has been shown by many authors . among them , @xcite included dust production and destruction in a cosmological simulation , predicting the statistical properties of dust emission luminosities in a large sample of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "more elaborate dust evolution models that include two major dust formation mechanisms ( dust formation in stellar ejecta and dust growth by accretion in the ism ) are also incorporated in semi - analytic @xcite or @xmath3-body @xcite frameworks .    however , the above cosmological galaxy evolution models only take the total dust content into account .",
    "it still remains challenging to include grain size distributions in these frameworks , because the freedom of grain size adds another dimension to the calculations .",
    "in fact , @xcite show that the extinction properties of lyman - break galaxies are influenced by the assumed dust size . at the same time , as shown by a13 ( see above ) , the evolution of the total dust amount is coupled with that of the grain size distribution .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to develop a method of treating the information on grain size distribution in a computationally light manner .    the first purpose of this paper is to develop a simple and light method of treating the evolution of grain size distribution in a galaxy .",
    "such a ` light ' method is also useful to analyze the dependence on various parameters that govern the grain size distribution , since we can easily run numerous cases with different parameter values .",
    "thus , the second purpose of this paper is detailed analysis of the response of dust enrichment to various dust enrichment and processing mechanisms .",
    "we also address future prospect of including the light dust evolution model developed in this paper into such complex galaxy evolution models as mentioned above ( i.e.  semi - analytic models , @xmath3-body simulations , etc . ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we first review the dust enrichment and processing mechanisms in section [ subsec : review ] , where we note that most of the dust formation and processing mechanisms work distinctively on small ( @xmath4 ) grains and large ( @xmath5 ) grains .",
    "this motivates us to apply a ` two - size approximation ' , in which we represent the grain size distribution by the ratio of the total mass of the small grains to that of the large grains .",
    "this ratio is referred to as the ` small - to - large grain abundance ratio ' . as demonstrated in this paper",
    ", this ` two - size approximation ' nicely catches the features in the full calculations of grain size evolution .",
    "we also propose to use this two - size approximation in complex galaxy evolution models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we review the processes to be taken into account , and formulate the model by using the two - size approximation in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we show the results in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we analyze and discuss the results in section [ sec : discussion ] and consider possibilities of including our models in complex galaxy evolution models in section [ sec : prospect ] .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in considering the evolution of dust in the ism of a galaxy , we need to consider not only the dust supply from stars but also dust processing in the ism .",
    "following a13 , we include the following processes considered to dominate the evolution of dust content and grain size distribution : ( i ) dust supply from stellar ejecta , ( ii ) dust destruction in the ism by supernova ( sn ) shocks , ( iii ) grain growth by the accretion of gas - phase metals , ( iv ) grain growth by coagulation ( sticking of grains ) , and ( v ) shattering ( grain disruption / fragmentation ) .",
    "these processes act differently on large and small grains . here",
    "we roughly divide the grains into large and small grains at @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the grain radius .",
    "we hereafter refer to grains with @xmath1 and @xmath0 as the large grains and the small grains , respectively .",
    "we summarize these processes in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "we also show , based on a13 , how each process acts on different grain sizes .",

    "the large grains dominate the total dust abundance because the stellar dust production is the dominant dust formation mechanism .",
    "since we assume a constant condensation efficiency ( @xmath12 ) of the metals in stellar ejecta , the dust - to - gas ratio is proportional to the metallicity ( @xmath13 ) at low metallicity ( see also section [ subsec : lowz ] ) .",
    "the slowdown of the increase around @xmath14 z@xmath15 is due to the destruction by sn shocks . at the same time , the small grains increase because shattering time - scale becomes short enough to produce small grains through the collisions of the large grains .",
    "after that , accretion further accelerates the increase of the small grains , and at the same time , the large grains rapidly increase because coagulation of small grains becomes active .",
    "this rapid increase of both small and large grain abundances appears around @xmath16 z@xmath15 .",
    "this increase slows down after a significant fraction of gas - phase metals are used up .",
    "the increase of dust - to - gas ratio is driven by the metal enrichment at high metallicity , where the dust - to - metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and sn destruction .",

    "associated with the rapid increase of @xmath18 by accretion , there appears an epoch at which @xmath23 reaches its peak . at this stage",

    "this occurs at the critical metallicity of accretion . above this critical metallicity ,",
    "the dust growth time - scale becomes shorter than the destruction time - scale so that accretion overcomes the dust destruction effect .",

    "[ fig : sn ] , we observe that the small value of @xmath32 delays the dust mass growth by accretion . this is because accretion is suppressed because more small grains are destroyed . nevertheless ,",
    "because of the strong metallicity dependence of accretion , accretion still becomes efficient enough around @xmath36 z@xmath15 to boost @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",

    "shattering does not directly change the dust abundance , but it plays an important role in the total dust abundance through its capability of producing a large number of small grains , whose growth by accretion is of fundamental importance in the dust mass increase ( see also @xcite and a13 ) .",

    "in contrast , @xcite concluded that @xmath18@xmath11 is largely affected by @xmath50 .",
    "this is because @xcite moved @xmath50 freely , while we assume the proportionality between @xmath50 and @xmath57 through equations ( [ eq : dmdt_acc ] ) and ( [ eq : sfr ] ) since both star formation and accretion occur in the dense ism .    as observed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] , the small - to - large grain abundance ratio is largely varied by the change of @xmath50 especially at low metallicity . at low metallicity ,",

    "our simple two - size approach successfully catches the characteristics of grain size evolution in a13 s full calculation of grain size distribution . in the early stage of galaxy evolution",
    "when the metallicity is much smaller than the critical metallicity of accretion , the dust is predominantly enriched by stellar ejecta . in this stage ,",
    "the large grains dominate the dust content .",
    "the only path of small grain formation is shattering , which becomes more and more efficient as the system is enriched with the large grains . at a metallicity level referred to as the critical metallicity , the abundance of small grains formed by shattering becomes large enough to activate the grain growth by accretion , which contributes to the rapid increase of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "associated with this phase , the small - to - large grain abundance ratio becomes the largest in the entire life of the galaxy . after the increase of dust - to - gas ratio by accretion",
    "is saturated , the small - to - large grain abundance ratio is governed by the balance between shattering and coagulation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dgs_dgl ] ) , valid for high - metallicity galaxies , can be used to constrain the ratio of the coagulation time - scale to the shattering time - scale . in particular , in the milky way , the self - consistent small - to - large grain abundance ratio",
    "can be estimated as @xmath115 .",
    "using @xmath116 estimated in section [ subsec : evol ] based on the mrn grain size distribution , we obtain @xmath117 in the milky way .",
    "the ratio should depend on the mass fractions of various ism phases @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to determine the absolute values of @xmath42 and @xmath46 , putting a constraint on the ratio of these two time - scales is a big step to understand the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the major purposes of developing computationally light models for the evolution of grain size distribution is to implement it in complex galaxy evolution models .",
    "it is extremely difficult to calculate the full evolution of grain size distribution , since it is simply expected that the computational time increases in proportion to the number of grain size bins .",
    "many galaxy evolution models already treat metal enrichment so that it is rather straightforward to calculate equations ( [ eq : ddldt2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ddsdt2 ] ) in such models .",
    "we could apply them to each galaxy or each sph particle .",
    "variation of @xmath46 and @xmath42 can also be included based on the mixture of various ism phases @xcite or based on the density and temperature of each sph particle @xcite , as straightforward extensions .    as a trade - off of the simplicity , there is of course a demerit of using such a simple model as developed in this paper .",
    "since it does not treat the full information of the grain size distribution , we need to assume a functional form of grain size distribution in calculating observational dust properties .",
    "representative observational quantities related to dust are extinction curves and infrared dust emission seds . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss how to calculate these quantities using the two - size model , in order to provide future prospects .",
    "the real implementation of our models to galaxy evolution models will be done in future work .    here",
    "we propose to use a ` modified - lognormal function ' for the grain size distributions of the small and large grains ( the grain size distribution is defined so that @xmath118 is the number of grains per hydrogen nucleus in the range of grain radii between @xmath7 and @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : lognormal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscript @xmath121 indicates the small ( @xmath122 ) or large ( @xmath123 ) grain component , @xmath124 is the normalization constant , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the central grain radius and the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution , respectively .",
    "the functional form is adopted so that the mass distribution @xmath127 is lognormal .",
    "we adopt @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , to roughly cover the small and large grain size ranges .",
    "we hereafter refer to this grain size distribution as the lognormal model .",
    "the normalizing constants are determined by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the gas mass per hydrogen nucleus , @xmath133 is the hydrogen atom mass , and @xmath134 is the material density of a dust grain .",
    "therefore , the evolutions of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are reduced to those of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively .",
    "the extinction at wavelength @xmath137 in units of magnitude ( @xmath138 ) normalized to the column density of hydrogen nuclei ( @xmath139 ) is written as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the extinction efficiency factor , which is evaluated by using the mie theory @xcite and the same optical constants for silicate and carbonaceous dust in @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , the mass fractions of silicate and carbonaceous dust are assumed to be 0.54 and 0.46 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath142 and 2.24 g @xmath143 for silicate and carbonaceous dust , respectively @xcite .     in appendix",
    "[ app : lognormal ] , in order to examine how well the lognormal model is capable of approximating the mrn model ( @xmath144 with @xmath145 ) , which is known to reproduce the milky way extinction curve well , we compare the extinction curves predicted by these two models under the same small - to - large grain abundance ratio .",
    "we confirm that the lognormal model approximately reproduces the milky way extinction curve , which means that the lognormal model provides a useful simple approach to predict the extinction curve in the two - size approximation .",
    "now we examine the extinction curves predicted by our two - size dust evolution models with the fiducial parameter values . in fig .",

    "the extinction curve becomes the steepest with the most prominent carbon bump .",
    "afterwards , coagulation pushes the grains to large sizes , and accordingly the extinction curve becomes flatter .",

    "these two dispersions are roughly comparable except at the carbon bump where our models predict too large a dispersion . probably the assumption that the silicate to graphite ratio is constant",

    "[ fig : ext_disp],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      another important observational feature that reflects the dust properties is the dust emission sed at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths . at long wavelengths ( @xmath154 ) ,",
    "the dust responsible for the emission can be treated as being in radiative equilibrium with the ambient interstellar radiation field , so that the sed shape depends mainly on the total dust amount and the equilibrium dust temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the grain size distribution is not very important at those long wavelengths .    in contrast , at wavelengths @xmath155 , the emission is governed by small grains ( @xmath156 ) , whose heat capacities are so small that they are transiently heated by discrete photon inputs @xcite .",
    "thus , the spectrum at @xmath155 is sensitive to the grain size distribution .",
    "moreover , some spectral features specific to certain dust species such as pah features are prominent at @xmath157 , which means that a detailed spectral modeling is necessary for this wavelength range .",
    "therefore , the two - size models developed in this paper would be too rough to predict the evolution of dust sed at such short wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , we could prepare spectral templates for the small and large grains , and mix them according to the small - to - large grain abundance ratio calculated by the two - size models .",
    "if we separately calculate various grain species , we could also sum up all the templates calculated for various dust species . in this way , we will be able to predict the evolution of dust emission seds without consuming much computational time .",
    "we have examined a possibility of treating the evolution of grain size distribution with two representing grain radii , motivated by the fact that a full treatment of grain size distribution is too heavy to be incorporated in cosmological galaxy evolution models . in this ` two - size approximation ' , we consider small ( grain radius @xmath0 ) and large ( @xmath1 ) grains and treat the evolution of the mass fractions of these two components through various processes of grain formation and processing .",
    "we include dust supply from stellar ejecta , destruction in sn shocks , dust growth by accretion , grain growth by coagulation and grain disruption by shattering .",
    "first we demonstrated that the following features of the full treatment of grain size distribution by a13 are correctly reproduced by the two - size approximation .",
    "the dust enrichment starts with the supply of the large grains from stars .",
    "the dominant dust production mechanism switches to accretion at a metallicity level referred to as the critical metallicity of accretion , since the abundance of the small grains formed by shattering becomes large enough to rapidly increase the grain abundance by accretion .",
    "just after the system has reached this stage , the small - to - large grain abundance ratio reaches the maximum .",
    "after that , this ratio converges to the value determined by the balance between shattering and coagulation , and the dust - to - metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and shock destruction .    with a monte carlo simulation",

    "we examine how well the milky way extinction curve is reproduced by the log - normal model of grain size distribution ( equation [ eq : lognormal ] ) , comparing it with the @xcite ( mrn ) grain size distribution ( @xmath158 in the grain radius range of 0.0010.25 @xmath151 ) , which is already known to reproduce the milky way extinction curve well .",
    "the mass ratio of silicate to carbonaceous dust is assumed to be the same as the value used in the text ( 0.54 : 0.46 ) .",
    "we adopt the same small - to - large grain abundance ratio as the mrn model ( 0.30 : 0.70 ; see section [ subsec : evol ] ) ; that is , we do not use the output of our dust enrichment model for the purpose of simply comparing with the mrn model .     in fig .",
    "[ fig : ext ] , we compare the grain size distributions and the extinction curves . although the lognormal model deviates from the observed mean extinction curve of the milky way more than the mrn model , the difference between these two models is significant only at the bump around @xmath159 contributed from small graphite grains and toward far - ultraviolet wavelengths , and the deviations are within 20 per cent .",
    "we expect that , in calculating extinction curves in extragalactic objects , the uncertainties arising from assumed grain properties are rather larger .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the simple lognormal model provides a good approximate method of calculating extinction curves based on the two - size approximation .     to show the mass distribution in each logarithmic bin of the grain radius @xmath7 .",
