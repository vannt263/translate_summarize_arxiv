    "the structure of a circumstellar disk is expected to dramatically change during the planet formation process . in a few  million years",
    "an optically thick massive protoplanetary disk will transform into an optically thin debris disk with little material ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "processes like viscous accretion , photo evaporation , grain growth , and planet formation shape the structure of circumstellar disks , and in particular , the process of planet formation creates gaps , cavities , and asymmetries that can be directly observed @xcite .",
    "circumstellar disks with gaps and/or cavities lack warm dust close to the star while still possessing a significant reservoir of cold dust in the outer disk .",
    "such disks are classified as transitional disks , and plenty is known about their inner disk gaps / cavities .",
    "however , it is only recently that observations have reached the sensitivity and angular resolution required to study asymmetrical features in the outer disk structure .",
    "particularly , the only known examples of high contrast asymmetries in transitional disks at submillimeter wavelengths are hd  142527  @xcite , oph  irs  48  @xcite , and lkh@xmath2  330  @xcite . to understand the process of planet formation , long wavelength observations are critical , since they are less affected by optical depth , and hence trace the bulk of the mass surface density .    in this letter",
    ", we present alma observations at 0.45  mm of two disks surrounding the stars sao  206462  and sr  21 , which exhibit large - scale asymmetries in their dust continuum emission that were not known before with high significance .",
    "sao  206462 is an isolated herbig ae / be star ( f4ve , @xmath8 ) , at a distance of 142 pc in the sco - ob2 association .",
    "the disk surrounding sao  206462  is classified as a transitional disk , with a large dust - depleted cavity ( @xmath9  au ) and a massive outer disk @xcite .",
    "recently , scattered light observations of the polarized intensity at near - ir wavelengths revealed spiral - like structure in the outer disk of sao  206462  .",
    "sr  21  is a young g3 star ( @xmath10 ) in the @xmath11-ophiuchus star forming region at a distance of 119  pc . the dust - depleted cavity ( @xmath12  au , * ?",
    "* ) in this transition disk @xcite is not completely devoid of material , as rovibrational co line observations reveal the presence of inner disk gas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent polarized intensity h - band observations of sr  21  by @xcite display emission inside the cavity radius , and unlike sao  206462 , the radial profile of emission is quite smooth .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ , > \" , ]",
    "we present maps of the dust and gas emission ( @xmath0co  @xmath1 ) in figure  1 .",
    "these observations resolve the structure of each transitional disk , revealing for the first time the striking morphology in the dust continuum emission for sao  206462  and sr  21 : a non - uniform ring with a bright asymmetry located in the south - west for sao  206462  and in the south for sr  21 . the integrated intensity map ( moment 0 ) and the intensity - weighted mean velocity map ( moment 1 ) of @xmath0co  @xmath1 are presented in the middle and right panels of figure  1 .",
    "in contrast with the dust emission , the gaseous component from the @xmath0co moment 0 map appears to be quite compact and mostly symmetric . however , significant emission ( @xmath13 ) can be found at large radii in the @xmath0co moment 1 map , just as with the dust emission .",
    "since emission from @xmath0co is most likely optically thick , it is not a good tracer of depletion inside the cavity and other tracers must be used . however , a large depletion of the inner disk can give rise to the double - peaked structure observed in the sao  206462  moment 0 map .",
    "further analysis of these co observations will be deferred to a future publication .",
    "we measured the disk position angle ( pa ) from the rotation of the disk in the @xmath0co moment 1 map ; the measured pa east of north is @xmath14 and @xmath15 for sao  206462  and sr  21 , respectively .",
    "our derived pa is consistent with measurements found in the literature . for sao  206462  measurements from molecular gas ( inside and outside the cavity ) and",
    "polarization give a pa between @xmath16-@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for sr  21 , @xcite constrained its pa to @xmath18 from rovibrational co band observations of molecular gas inside the cavity , while @xcite inferred a pa of @xmath19 from dust continuum observations of the outer disk .",
    "the contrast between the peak of emission and the opposite side of the disk is @xmath20 in sao  206462  and @xmath21 in sr  21 .",
    "these asymmetries have lower contrast values than those found in lkh@xmath2  330  ( @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hd  142527  ( @xmath23 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and oph  irs  48  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath24 , ) , nevertheless they are significant enough to warrant further analysis .",
    "the @xmath25 m observations from @xcite constrained the surface density at the edge of the cavity to be @xmath26 for both sao  206462  and sr  21 . assuming a dust opacity of @xmath27 at @xmath28 m @xcite , we find that the 0.45  mm optical depth of dust is @xmath29 at the peak of the emission from the ring , and it is expected that at larger radii from the disk @xmath30 should be lower .",
    "we also computed the brightness temperature ( @xmath31 ) of the emission without the raleigh - jeans approximation .",
    "the left panels of figure  1 show contours of @xmath31 , starting at 10  k and spaced every 5  k. at the peak of emission , @xmath32  k for sao  206462 , and @xmath33  k for sr  21 . at the distance where the asymmetry is located ( @xmath34  au for sao  206462  and@xmath35  au for sr  21 ) ,",
    "a temperature of 30 - 35  k is a reasonable value for the dust temperature in a flared disk , consistent with @xmath36 derived above .",
    "we expect then that these alma observations trace some of the mass surface density , since the emission is borderline between optically thin and optically thick emission .",
    "to constrain the structure of these large - scale asymmetries , we compare the dust continuum observations of sao  206462  and sr  21  with simple morphological models that describe the emission from a ring and a vortex .",
    "these morphological models were chosen since these are known transitional disks that can be well - described by a ring - like structure @xcite , and theoretical studies suggest that asymmetries in disk emission may arise for vortices ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for the ring morphology we use a gaussian prescription in the radial direction : in polar coordinates . ]",
    "the ring emission corresponds to @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius where the ring peaks , @xmath39 is the flux density at @xmath38 , and @xmath40 is the ring width . in our modeling the ring emission",
    "is assumed to be axisymmetric .",
    "for the vortex morphology , we employ the prescription presented in @xcite , where the mass - surface density of a steady - state vortex can be described as a gaussian in the radial and azimuthal directions : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the radius and pa of the vortex s peak , @xmath44 is the flux density at @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the radial and azimuthal width of the vortex .",
    "this way , the structure of a disk can be described by a ring of emission ( 3 parameters ) , a vortex ( 5 parameters ) , or the combination of both ( 8 parameters ) .",
    "we fix the disk pa to the value measured in section  3 , and setup models of a ring and a ring with a vortex , leaving the disk center ( @xmath47 ) and inclination ( @xmath48 ) as free parameters .",
    "each model realization is fourier transformed and sampled at the same _ uv_-positions as the observation .",
    "the best - fit model was found by minimizing the @xmath49 statistic using the latest implementation of the affine - invariant mcmc _ emcee _",
    "software @xcite .",
    "table  2 presents the best - fit parameters found for a ring model and a ring+vortex model .",
    "as expected , the @xmath49 analysis favors a ring with a vortex model , since a ring alone can not reproduce the large asymmetrical structures of these alma observations .",
    "we note that for sr 21 , our preliminary ring+vortex model fitting favored a face - on geometry ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "nevertheless , gas tracers show disk rotation making such geometry unlikely .",
    "thus , we fixed the inclination to @xmath51 for sr 21 ring+vortex modeling , consistent with the @xmath0co  @xmath1 line shape and motivated by the result of our ring - only model .",
    "the best - fit model and residual maps for the two morphologies explored are presented in figures 2 and 3 for sao  206462  and sr  21 , respectively .",
    "these figures compare alma observations ( top row , leftmost panel ) with the best - fit model and residual maps ( middle and right panels ) , where the residual emission is found by subtracting the model from the observations .",
    "when considering only a ring , the best - fit model corresponds to the average flux of the disk over all azimuthal angles .",
    "hence large regions of negative emission are expected since the azimuthally averaged flux also encompasses flux from the large - scale asymmetry .",
    "the addition of a vortex prescription in the fitting improves the resulting residual map and @xmath49 of the fit , although significant emission ( @xmath52 ) remains .",
    "the cavity radius ( @xmath53 ) found in the literature for these disks has some scatter , on average @xmath54  au for sao  206462  and @xmath55  au for sr  21   @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath53 from these studies is consistent with our constraints within @xmath56 for all but @xcite observations of sao  206462 , which have lower angular resolution than these alma observations .",
    "the analysis presented above demonstrates that a ring of emission does not describe the disk structure of sao  206462  and sr  21 ; the addition of a vortex prescription better describes the large - scale asymmetries .",
    "however , the observed asymmetries might not directly trace the mass surface density , since short - wavelength observations may not be completely optically thin .",
    "future long - wavelength observations will confirm that these asymmetries correspond to mass rather than temperature variations .",
    "the vortex encompasses 15% of the total flux density for sao  206462  and 28% for sr  21 .",
    "these are quite similar to the recently studied disk around lkh@xmath2  330  ( 30% ) but much less dramatic than the oph  irs  48  and hd  142527  disks , where a horseshoe shape , rather than a ring , is observed at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the flux density in the asymmetry corresponds to a mass ( dust+gas ) of @xmath57 for both sao  206462  and sr  21 , assuming a temperature of @xmath58 , a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and a dust opacity of @xmath27 at @xmath28 m @xcite .",
    "these are lower limits on the vortex mass , given the uncertainty in optical depth at this wavelength .",
    "compared to recent examples of large - scale asymmetries observed in lkh@xmath2  330  and oph  irs  48 , the radial extent of the vortices in sao  206462  and sr  21  is also quite narrow , with a fwhm of few tens of au ( see table  2 ) .",
    "azimuthally , the vortices are well resolved , and while the sr  21  asymmetry has a fwhm@xmath59 , similar to lkh@xmath2  330  and oph  irs  48 , the azimuthal extent in sao  206462  is 30% larger , covering almost half of the disk .    from our modeling",
    "we find that the vortex aspect ratio is @xmath60 for sao  206462  and @xmath61 for sr  21 .",
    "following the solution presented by @xcite , a steady - state vortex tends to concentrate large grains toward its center , in an amount that depends on the ratio between the dust grain stokes number ( @xmath62 ) and the gas turbulence velocity ( see also birnstiel et al .",
    "our measurements of the vortex structure and knowledge of the stokes number allow us to constrain the gas turbulence .",
    "dust grains with size @xmath63  mm and internal density @xmath64 g @xmath65 , embedded in a disk with a surface density of @xmath66 g @xmath67 have a stoke number @xmath68 .",
    "the vortex aspect ratio derived for sao  206462  and sr  21  would then require turbulent velocities of about @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively , corresponding to about 22% and 16% of the local isothermal sound speed for a gas temperature of 50  k. such values are about 5 times larger that those derived for oph  irs  48 , and consistent with an active disk layer due to the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "when including the vortex prescription in the fit , there are still significant residual emission in both sao  206462  and sr  21 .",
    "these residuals are not symmetric , and their morphology is not well described by an additional vortex since they extends outwards with increasing radius .",
    "a spiral - like structure may be a good approximation for the residual emission seen in both disks , but the number of parameters of such a prescription is quite large ( at least 5 more parameters per spiral arm ) .",
    "given the low signal of these features and degeneracies between such large number of parameters , we decided not to proceed with such a fit .",
    "observations at higher angular resolution are required to study in greater detail the morphology of these structures .    on the bottom left panel of figures 2 and 3 , we present polarized intensity maps at h - band of both disks @xcite .",
    "this emission , likely optically thick , does not directly traces mass surface density . in sao  206462",
    "two spiral - like structures are seen in h - band imaging ( figure 2 ) .",
    "@xcite compared the shape of these structures with theoretical models for a perturbation due to low - mass companions , their best - fit spirals , s1 and s2 , are labeled in figure 2 . for the s1 spiral , the location of the unseen perturber coincides with the location of the peak of emission in the alma map ( at @xmath71  au from the star with pa of @xmath72 ) .",
    "if the 0.45  mm observations trace a mass overdensity at this location , we may be witnessing a spiral wave pattern that arose from a density enhancement rather than a point - like perturber , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "figure 2 also shows the location of s1/s2 with respect to the modeling residuals .",
    "some overlap exist between the submillimeter residuals and the near - ir emission , with the s1/s2 spiral arms generally found inward of where the submillimeter residuals are .",
    "nevertheless , observations with better angular resolution of sao  206462  are required to investigate whether the submillimeter emission traces the spiral structures observed in the near - ir .    in the case of sr  21 , @xcite showed that not only is the h - band polarized intensity image is rather smooth and axisymmetric , but it is also not compatible with the large depletion of material in the inner disk ( @xmath73 ) found by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , radiative transfer modeling of these near - ir observations did not find a transition between the outer disk and the depleted inner disk , even for modest depletion levels of 1 - 10% @xcite .",
    "these h - band observations of sr  21  show evidence for emission from small grains out to a 80  au radius , and compared with our alma observations , it shows no signs of the observed asymmetries ( figure  3 ) . the difference in spatial distribution of the small grains ( traced by near - ir observations ) and",
    "the mm - sized particles ( traced by these alma observations ) , could arise from the presence of a local enhancement in the gas density .",
    "for example disk vortices , which can be excited by rossby - wave instabilities at the outer edge of gas depleted cavities , are particularly efficient at trapping large dust grains while small grains remain coupled to the gas .",
    "although not as dramatic as in the oph  irs  48  case , the vortex in sr  21  may be driving the distribution of large and small particles within the disk .",
    "we have observed two transitional disks , sao  206462  and sr  21 , with high sensitivity using alma .",
    "these transitional disks display large - scale asymmetries in their dust continuum emission , just as two other recently observed with alma @xcite , and an additional disk observed with carma @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that of the few such objects observed with high sensitivity and high angular resolution , most exhibit high contrast asymmetrical structures .",
    "the lack of previous detections is likely due to phase errors introduced by the atmosphere and the lack of sensitivity of previous observations .",
    "this may imply that the process ( or processes ) that drive these asymmetries is taking place in most transitional disks .    in the case of sao  206462  and sr  21",
    ", we have demonstrated that a ring does not describe these observations , and a vortex - like asymmetry , in addition to a ring of emission , is a better match .",
    "such asymmetrical structures encompass a significant fraction ( @xmath7 ) of the total disk emission , although we found that their contrast is much smaller than in lkh@xmath2  330 , hd  142527 , and oph  irs  48 .",
    "asymmetries in sao  206462  and sr  21  have a narrow radial size and a broad azimuthal extent , similar to the lkh@xmath2  330  and oph  irs  48  asymmetrical structures .",
    "if these asymmetries are in fact non - transient vortices , the turbulence inside them needs to be substantial in order to produce the azimuthally - broad asymmetrical features .    despite being a better fit",
    ", the vortex prescription does not reproduce every observed feature .",
    "significant residuals remain that are suggestive of spiral - like structure , in the case of sao  206462  some residuals roughly coincide with the spiral arms seen in h - band scattered light . to test the presence of large - scale spiral - like features , and to make sure the observed structures trace the mass surface density of the disk down to the midplane ,",
    "observations at longer wavelengths are required .",
    "future observations with alma at 3  mm , and/or with the very large array at 7  mm , will help in this regard , since such observations trace larger dust grains and will have lower optical depth .",
    "we thank takayuki muto , carol grady , and katherine follette for providing the near - ir images , and we thank wladimir lyra for useful discussions .",
