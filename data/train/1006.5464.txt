    "string theory has offered significant insights in answering many puzzles surrounding properties of black holes . arguably , one of the greatest successes of string theory is the statistical mechanical explanation of the bekenstein - hawking entropy of certain extremal and near - extremal black holes .",
    "the first example was the five - dimensional black hole studied in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , a number of different types of black holes have been studied and the agreement between the statistical mechanical entropy and the bekenstein - hawking entropy has been shown to hold in each case ( see e.g. reviews @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , references @xcite extended the success of @xcite to the five - dimensional near - extremal setting .",
    "the black holes considered in @xcite all have topologically spherical horizons . in 2004 ,",
    "elvang , emparan , mateos , and reall ( eemr ) @xcite presented the first example of a supersymmetric solution with horizon topology @xmath8 , that is , a supersymmetric black ring .",
    "the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the supersymmetric black ring was reproduced from a statistical mechanical description in @xcite using the maldacena - strominger - witten ( msw ) cft @xcite .",
    "although , the application of msw cft gives an impressive match of the statistical and bekenstein - hawking entropies , it leaves many questions unanswered . for a critical discussion and further references",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is hoped ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the matching of the statistical and bekenstein - hawking entropies for black rings in the thermally excited ( near - extremal ) setting will clarify many questions left unanswered in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "a microscopic discussion for the entropy of the yet - to - be found black ring that describes thermal excitations over the supersymmetric ring of @xcite is already proposed in the literature @xcite .    on the supergravity side ,",
    "the construction of a black ring solution that describes thermal excitations over the supersymmetric black ring is a significantly involved problem . unlike the case of",
    "topologically spherical black holes @xcite , one can not add a sufficient number of charges on a neutral black ring by applying familiar solution generating techniques such as boosts and string dualities .",
    "for example , one can not add @xcite three independent m2 charges to an otherwise neutral ring by applying boosts and string dualities . adding the third m2 charge",
    "typically requires applying a boost along the direction of a kk - monopole in an intermediate step .",
    "such a boost is incompatible with the identifications imposed by the kk - monopole fibration . in effect",
    ", one ends up generating pathological spacetimes .",
    "a variant of this problem also arises in the straight string limit when one tries to add three m2 charges on top of a black string carrying three m5 charges @xcite .",
    "this and related problems have resisted various attempts to construct a variety of non - extremal black string and black ring solutions @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite shed some light on this problem from a group theoretic perspective in the simplified setting of minimal five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "there the pseudo - compact generators of the three - dimensional hidden symmetry group were associated to charging transformations .",
    "a proposal was made to construct the solution in the straight string limit by acting with several charging transformations .",
    "the proposal however did not allow the authors of @xcite to write the solution in a manageable form .",
    "in this paper we extend the investigations of @xcite and present a solution of this problem in minimal supergravity in the straight string limit , i.e. , we explicitly construct the most general black string solution of five dimensional minimal supergravity .",
    "our black string has five independent parameters , namely , magnetic one - brane charge , smeared electric zero - brane charge , boost along the string direction , energy above the bps bound , and rotation in the transverse space . in our solution one is allowed to vary all five parameters independently . upon setting the magnetic or electric charge to zero ,",
    "our solution reduces to the spinning non - extremal string solutions of @xcite .",
    "our solution admits a four parameter family of extremal black strings corresponding to having maximal rotation in the transverse space .",
    "we can recover the two known extremal black strings by taking additional limits . in one limit we recover the three parameter supersymmetric string of @xcite . in another extremal limit our string solution reduces to the three parameter non - rotating non - supersymmetric string of @xcite .",
    "when the pressureless condition is imposed , our solution describes the infinite radius limit of the most general class of black rings of minimal supergravity .    on the microscopics side",
    ", the validity of the entropy formula in @xcite depends on the absence of finite ring radius corrections , which is not guaranteed _ a priori_. in the straight string limit this subtlety goes away .",
    "so , it is expected that the entropy formula in @xcite reproduces the bekenstein - hawking entropy of our string in the near - extremal limit .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case once one has made precise the connection between quantities defined near the horizon and at infinity .",
    "an important open issue in the black ring literature has been why various black ring solutions must obey a number of bounds on various parameters in order to be smooth .",
    "for example , for the supersymmetric ring of minimal supergravity , the electric charge is bounded from below @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is in terms of the dipole charge and the radius of the ring @xcite .",
    "curiously enough , the bound persists in the infinite radius limit . although , we do not offer a complete understanding of these issues , our string solution does shed light on some limit of these puzzles as well .",
    "the extremal pressureless limits of our non - rotating string provide us with a working phase diagram for a class of extremal black rings of minimal supergravity .",
    "the phase diagram suggests that as the above mentioned bound on the electric charge of the supersymmetric black ring is violated , a non - supersymmetric branch of extremal black rings emerges .",
    "this non - supersymmetric branch of extremal black rings has not yet been constructed in full generality . on this branch",
    "one can continuously take the electric charge to zero , thus the non - supersymmetric branch of black rings is connected to a dipole ring of @xcite .",
    "the dipole ring is such that in the infinite radius limit the boost along the string completely breaks supersymmetry .",
    "our phase diagram in addition suggests that there is another branch of extremal black rings in minimal supergravity .",
    "this branch is also connected to a dipole ring of @xcite .",
    "the dipole ring on this branch is such that in the infinite radius limit the boost along the string _ preserves _ supersymmetry .",
    "extremal black rings on this branch are also not known in full generality .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : setup ]",
    "we introduce our notation and conventions . in section",
    "[ sec : construction ] we construct the most general black string solution and analyze its physical properties and thermodynamics .",
    "first , in section [ charge_matrix ] , we construct a group element of g@xmath9 in order to build an appropriate ` charge matrix ; ' for the benefit of the reader the concept of the ` charge matrix ' is reviewed .",
    "next , in section [ sec : monster ] , we act on the kerr string with this group element to construct the most general string . physical properties and thermodynamics of our general solution",
    "are presented in section [ thermo ] . in section [ sec :",
    "limits ] we explicitly find the extremal limits of our solution . in [ extremal_limits ]",
    "we show there are three distinct extremal limits , corresponding to a four - parameter non - supersymmetric string with maximal rotation in the transverse space , a three - parameter supersymmetric string , and a three - parameter non - rotating non - supersymmetric string . in [ electric ] and [ magnetic ] we briefly discuss how our solution reduces to the spinning @xmath10 and @xmath11 strings respectively . in section [ sec : decoupling ] we match the entropy of our general solution with the prediction of @xcite . in section [ decoupling ]",
    "we outline how to properly take the decoupling limit and verify that our solution in this limit is @xmath12 . in section",
    "[ matching ] we match the entropy with the cft prediction .",
    "we finish in section [ sec : discussion ] with a summary and a discussion about a few implications that the work presented herein has for yet - to - be found black rings .",
    "since we are interested in constructing a black string solution , we can compactify minimal five - dimensional supergravity along the string direction and construct the corresponding black hole in the resulting four - dimensional theory . this way to approaching",
    "the problem turns out to be much more systematic , as there are a number of theorems @xcite to bank on concerning black holes in the resulting four - dimensional theory .",
    "the resulting four - dimensional theory is a single modulus @xmath13 supergravity .",
    "it is sometimes also called the s@xmath14 model ( or the @xmath15 model ) as its prepotential is cubic in the modulus .",
    "it can be obtained by setting s@xmath16t@xmath16u in the stu model @xcite . in this section",
    "we review salient features of @xmath13 single modulus s@xmath14 model .",
    "we define electromagnetic charges in this model and discuss the uplift back to minimal five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "let us start from the bosonic sector of eleven - dimensional supergravity @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a three - form and @xmath20 is its field - strength .",
    "upon compactification on a six - torus with the ansatz ds^2_11 & = & ds^2_5 + dx_1 ^ 2 + dx^2_2 + + dx_6 ^ 2 + a & = & a ( d x_1 d x_2+dx_3 dx_4 + dx_5 dx_6 ) we obtain the bosonic sector of @xmath21 ( i.e. , minimal ) five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the lagrangian takes the form of einstein - maxwell theory with a chern - simons term , @xmath22 to perform the dimensional reduction to four dimensions , we assume that the extra spatial direction ( denoted @xmath23 ) is compact and is a killing vector in the five - dimensional spacetime . using the standard kaluza - klein ansatz to yield a four - dimensional lagrangian in einstein frame",
    "we write the five - dimensional metric as @xmath24 from this ansatz one finds ( see for example @xcite ) that the resulting four - dimensional lagrangian takes the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 the scalars @xmath27 and @xmath28 parameterize an @xmath29 coset .",
    "the four electromagnetic charges corresponding to the two vectors are defined as follows .",
    "the equations of motion for the potentials @xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 and @xmath33 using , one can rewrite as the closure of a form @xmath34 , @xmath35 we then use the closed forms @xmath34 and @xmath36 given by and to define conserved electric charges in asymptotically flat four - dimensional spacetimes as integrals over a two - sphere at spatial infinity @xmath37 @xmath38 in a similar fashion , from the bianchi identities @xmath39 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 we define the magnetic charges @xmath40 note the minus sign in the definition of @xmath41 .",
    "we work with sign conventions in which the static extremal black hole carrying positive @xmath41 and @xmath42 charges is supersymmetric . from the m - theory point of view",
    "the electromagnetic charges correspond to the brane charges as indicated in table [ tablecharges ] : 0.2 cm       0.2 cm from table [ pressureless ] we can immediately draw a number of conclusions .",
    "clearly , only case @xmath43 saturates the five - dimensional bps bound .",
    "it corresponds to the black string of @xcite , which in turn corresponds to the infinite radius limit of the supersymmetric black ring of @xcite . in case",
    "@xmath43 the m2@xmath14 electric charge @xmath44 is bounded from below @xmath45 . as this bound is violated , solution @xmath43 ceases to be smooth .",
    "precisely when solution @xmath43 becomes singular , the pressureless non - supersymmetric solution , case @xmath46 , takes over .",
    "see figure [ fig : phase ] .",
    "branch @xmath46 is completely smooth . on this branch",
    "one can continuously take the electric charge to zero .",
    "thus the corresponding black ring is connected to an extremal dipole ring of @xcite .",
    "the dipole ring is such that in the infinite radius limit , the boost along the string completely breaks supersymmetry .",
    "black ring solutions on this branch are not known in full generality .",
    "case @xmath47 , on the other hand , indicates that there is another branch of extremal black rings of minimal supergravity .",
    "this branch is also connected to an extremal dipole ring of @xcite .",
    "the dipole ring on this branch is such that in the infinite radius limit , the boost along the string _ preserves _ supersymmetry .",
    "black ring solutions on this branch are also not known in full generality .",
    "a five parameter family of black rings is conjectured to exist in minimal supergravity @xcite . for ranges of parameters",
    "for which this family would admit the infinite radius limit , the corresponding string solution would be contained in our general string .",
    "after some manipulations , one can show that for our general black string the tension can be set to zero for two distinct values of the boost parameter when the remaining parameters are left arbitrary ( and finite ) .",
    "the two distinct branches of pressureless strings are distinguished by the relative sign of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , or in five - dimensional language , by the property that the orientation of the momentum along the string is aligned or anti - aligned with the orientation of the magnetic charge @xmath50 .",
    "we refer to these two branches as the _ aligned _ pressureless string and the _ anti - aligned _ pressureless string .",
    "the former contains branch @xmath47 of the pressureless extremal strings while the latter contains branches @xmath43 and @xmath46 of the pressureless extremal strings .",
    "see figure [ fig : rings ] .",
    "let us examine the properties of these pressureless strings in a little more detail .",
    "without loss of generality , we only consider @xmath51 and @xmath52 by choosing @xmath53 as explained in section [ sec : monster ] .",
    "the aligned string has then @xmath54 and the anti - aligned string has @xmath55 .",
    "after a careful numerical analysis , we find that the two branches obey the following bound m^_5 |p_z| , where @xmath56 is the mass of the neutral pressureless black string ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the fact that the ( absolute value of the ) linear momentum is bounded from below indicates that the two branches are always separated .",
    "also , we note that for a fixed value of the mass and magnetic charge , the two branches of pressureless strings have a different electric charge which always obeys q_^ q_^ , m_5 , q _ ,    the electric charge simply vanish",
    ". it would be interesting to have an intuitive understanding of this physical effect .",
    "the presence of two distinct pressureless limits suggests that there are two classes of black rings each admitting an infinite radius limit .",
    "black rings on different branches rotate in different directions relative to the orientation of the dipole charge .",
    "see figure [ fig : rings ] .",
    "the analysis of @xcite shows that there is no smooth near - horizon geometry that describes a supersymmetric black ring in ads ",
    "the near horizon geometry of a supersymmetric black ring in ads necessarily possesses a conical singularity . in @xcite",
    "a more physical argument was presented for the absence of supersymmetric black rings in ads .",
    "it was based on the observation that the ads potential requires pressure along the one - brane in order to achieve mechanical equilibrium when the one - brane is curved into a contractible circle in ads .",
    "it was speculated that supersymmetry is presumably incompatible with this pressure , and so , in ads we should not expect supersymmetric black rings .",
    "however , the three parameter supersymmetric black string of @xcite invalidates the argument made in @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric black string of @xcite can have non - zero pressure ( see ) , so one can indeed balance it in ads by curving it into a contractible circle .",
    "however , upon curving a straight supersymmetric string , the configuration will , in general , not remain supersymmetric .",
    "the extremal strings of @xcite and more generally our general string provide requisite candidate strings that might correspond to the infinite radius limit of some ( non-)extremal black rings in ads .",
    "a detailed perturbative study following @xcite is left for the future .",
