    "the topic of quantum plasmas has recently attracted considerable attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a central reason for this accrued interest derives from the importance of quantum effects in the performance of today s micro - electronic devices , for which classical transport models are not always adequate in view of the increasing miniaturization level that is now entering the submicron domain .",
    "hence , it is desirable to achieve a good understanding of the basic properties of quantum transport models .",
    "the wigner - poisson system @xcite-@xcite is a quantum transport model that has proven to be suitable in the treatment of quantum devices like the resonant tunneling diode @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been referred @xcite to as perhaps the only _ kinetic _ quantum transport model amenable to detailed numerical simulation . in the present work ,",
    "we address the question of the stability of small - amplitude waves , described by the wigner - poisson system .    a convenient tool to investigate the linear stability of systems having a dispersion relation is provided by the nyquist method @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the basis of this approach . let @xmath0 be the dispersion relation , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the frequency and wave - number for small - amplitude oscillations . in most practical cases , it is impossible to solve exactly the dispersion relation for @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 , some kind of approximation being necessary .",
    "hence , the imaginary part of the frequency , which determines the stability properties of the system , can be obtained only in an approximate way . however",
    ", exact results can be found by splitting @xmath3 in its real and imaginary parts , @xmath4 .",
    "then , for fixed @xmath2 and real @xmath1 , by varying @xmath1 from minus to plus infinity we can draw a diagram in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the resulting curve , known as the nyquist diagram , determines the number of unstable modes of the system , which equals the number of times the origin is encircled by the diagram @xcite .",
    "for example , using the nyquist method , one can show that equilibrium distributions that are monotonically decreasing functions of the energy are stable against small perturbations .",
    "moreover , for symmetric equilibria with at most two maxima , the sign of the so - called penrose functional @xcite,@xcite determines the linear stability of the classical vlasov - poisson system .    in view of the utility of nyquist s",
    "method for classical plasmas , it seems desirable to investigate whether it can be applied to the quantum case too .",
    "this approach is justified , since the linear stability of waves in the wigner - poisson system is described by a dispersion relation , and is therefore amenable to nyquist s treatment .",
    "however , we can not a priori expect to obtain a result as general as in the classical case .",
    "indeed , as we shall see , the question of stability is subtler in the quantum framework , a typical example being provided by the two - stream instability @xcite . for simplicity , in the present work we shall only consider homogeneous equilibria for one - dimensional electrostatic plasmas consisting of mobile electrons .",
    "an immobile ionic background guarantees overall charge neutrality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we develop the fundamentals of the nyquist method as applied to quantum plasmas described by the wigner - poisson system",
    ". the stability properties of quantum plasmas are determined by the specific form of the quantum dispersion relation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we show that there are a rich variety of possible behaviors in quantum systems , which are not present in classical vlasov - poisson plasmas .",
    "in particular , in section iii , we prove that a quantum analogue of the penrose functional can not exist . to show this , we consider symmetric equilibria with at most two maxima .",
    "nevertheless , the nyquist method can still be used for wigner - poisson plasmas .",
    "this is explicitly shown in section iv , where we study a two - stream equilibrium , described by a bi - lorentzian distribution function , which is amenable to exact calculations .",
    "we find an exact criterion for stability , which reduces to the classical criterion when quantum effects becomes negligible .",
    "however , large quantum effects can destroy the instability occurring in the purely classical case . in section iv",
    ", we also include the example of the physically relevant distribution corresponding to a bump - in - tail equilibrium .",
    "our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "if @xmath6 is the wigner quasi - distribution and @xmath7 the scalar potential , then the wigner - poisson system @xcite-@xcite reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a functional of the scalar potential , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is a background ionic density , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath14 is the scaled planck constant and @xmath15 is the vacuum dielectric constant .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions in space and assume that for large @xmath16 , @xmath17 and all its velocity derivatives tend to zero .",
    "we also assume that the initial wigner function is everywhere positive . however , the time evolution determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) may force the wigner function to assume negative values .",
    "hence , a strict interpretation of @xmath17 as a true probability distribution is impossible . in spite of that",
    ", the wigner function may be used as a useful mathematical tool to compute macroscopic quantities such as the charge density and electric current .    the linear stability of a plasma , be it classical or quantum ,",
    "is determined by the dispersion relation , which is obtained after fourier transforming in space and laplace transforming in time . following this procedure , we obtain @xcite for a frequency @xmath1 and a wave number @xmath2 @xmath18 where the dispersion function @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath21 stands for the principal value symbol and @xmath22 denotes the ( spatially homogeneous ) equilibrium wigner function . also , @xmath23 is the usual plasma frequency .",
    "the quantum formulae reduce to the classical ones as @xmath24 . in particular , @xmath25 moreover , no matter what the value of @xmath14 , for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as in the classical case .    the topology of the nyquist diagram is determined by the sign of @xmath29 at the points where @xmath30 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the number of unstable modes equals the number of times the nyquist curve encircles the origin .",
    "therefore , unstable modes can only exist if @xmath31 for at least one of the points where @xmath32 . in the classical case ,",
    "the zeroes of the imaginary part of the dispersion function are determined by the points at which the distribution function has zero derivative . in the quantum case , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , the decisive points are the real roots @xmath33 of @xmath34 here and in the following , @xmath35 the geometrical interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is simple : we have to find the points @xmath33 that are equidistant to any two points at which @xmath36 has the same value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding distance is @xmath37 . in a sense ,",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is the finite difference version of the classical condition @xmath38 . finally , as nyquist s diagram is obtained taking exclusively real frequencies , only the real roots of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) are relevant .",
    "the basic tasks we have to perform are first solving eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , obtaining all real roots @xmath33 for a given @xmath37 , and then studying the sign of @xmath29 at each such root , taking @xmath39 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , we have @xmath40 now , in the cauchy principal value sense , @xmath41 using this fact , we can rewrite the real part of the dispersion function in the more convenient way @xmath42 in this form , the principal value symbol is not needed anymore , since the integrand is regular as @xmath43 goes to @xmath44 . indeed , using the fact that @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we find that @xmath46 is a finite quantity .",
    "a similar ( but not identical ) regularization procedure holds in the classical case too @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) are the fundamental equations for nyquist s method for one - dimensional quantum plasmas , in which only electrostatic fields are present .",
    "so far , the treatment has been completely general .",
    "let us now consider some particular equilibria in order to analyze the consequences of eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "if the equilibrium wigner function @xmath22 has a single maximum @xmath47 , then the geometric meaning of @xmath33 is sufficient to show that eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) has always one , and only one , real solution @xmath33 for any value of @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . depending on the shape of @xmath36 ,",
    "this solution can differ considerably from @xmath47 ( one has @xmath48 when @xmath36 is symmetric with respect to @xmath47 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath37 goes to zero , and again from geometrical arguments , we can convince ourselves that @xmath33 approaches @xmath47 .",
    "indeed by definition @xmath33 is equidistant to the points @xmath49 and @xmath50 for which @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding distance from @xmath33 to either @xmath49 or @xmath50 is @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath52 we have @xmath53 and for @xmath54 we have @xmath55 .",
    "hence , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is always positive , implying that the real part of the dispersion function is a positive quantity .",
    "also , for @xmath56 we have @xmath27 and @xmath57 . since there is only one root for eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we deduce that the nyquist diagram can not encircle the origin , and therefore no unstable modes can exist for an equilibrium with a single maximum .",
    "thus , no matter how strong quantum effects are , the conclusion is the same as for the classical case .",
    "let us now consider equilibria with a single minimum , @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is equivalent to consider equilibrium wigner functions with only two maxima , as on physical grounds the equilibrium function must decay to zero as @xmath59 .",
    "physically , such equilibria correspond to a situation where two counterstreaming electron populations ( with similar temperatures ) co - exist . in the classical case",
    ", the nyquist diagram for this situation leads to the construction of the so - called penrose functional @xmath60 = \\int\\,dv\\frac{f(v_{min } ) - f(v)}{(v_{min } - v)^2 } \\,,\\ ] ] which determines the stability properties of the system .",
    "the inequality @xmath61 < 0 $ ] is a necessary and sufficient condition for instability , for appropriate wave numbers .",
    "this can be easily seen from the classical limit @xmath62 of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "classically , the points @xmath33 where @xmath30 are the maxima ( @xmath63 ) and the minimum ( @xmath58 ) of the equilibrium distribution . for @xmath64 , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is always positive , and thus can not lead to instability . for @xmath65 ,",
    "the real part of the dispersion function reduces to @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "if the penrose functional is positive , instability is ruled out .",
    "if it is negative , one can always choose @xmath2 small enough so that @xmath67 and therefore some unstable modes must exist .",
    "this completes the proof of the necessary and sufficient penrose criterion .",
    "the natural question now is whether there exists an analogue penrose functional for the quantum case . for simplicity , in the following",
    "we restrict our discussion to wigner equilibria that are symmetric about @xmath58 , the point at which @xmath36 attains its minimum value . by a galilean transformation",
    ", this point can be taken as @xmath68 without loss of generality .",
    "we first notice that , in the classical case , one only has to consider the three velocities for which the equilibrium distribution function has zero derivative . in the quantum case , however , depending on the shape of the equilibrium wigner function , there can be more then three roots for eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , with fixed @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , root @xmath69 ( connecting one increasing and one decreasing branch of the distribution ) can be obtained from the local maximum @xmath47 , by varying @xmath37 continuously from zero to a certain value .",
    "the root @xmath70 ( connecting two decreasing branches of the distribution ) is of a different nature , arising only for sufficiently large @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to realize that , in the case of two maxima , there are always only three roots for eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) if @xmath37 is small enough , and up to five roots for larger values of @xmath37 . also notice that , for symmetric equilibria , the point @xmath71 is always a root , irrespective of the value of @xmath37 . for a given @xmath37 , possessing one , three or five real roots",
    "depends on the details of the equilibrium .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that , in the case of a two - humped distribution , a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for having five roots to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) is that @xmath72 .",
    "this can be shown by plotting the left- and right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) as a function of @xmath33 , and looking at the intersections of the two curves . in general",
    ", we obtain that one can have five solutions when @xmath73 is smaller than a certain threshold .",
    "note however that five roots only appear for sufficiently large values of @xmath37 ; for small enough @xmath37 , there are always only three roots . in section iv",
    ", we shall examine a bi - lorentzian distribution possessing at most three solutions .",
    "in addition , we shall discuss another two equilibria , which possess five solutions for sufficiently large @xmath37 .",
    "let us now consider the question of the existence of a quantum penrose functional .",
    "we need to examine the sign of @xmath29 at the different solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the root @xmath74 always exists and can yield either a positive or a negative value for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , depending on the shape of the equilibrium and the value of @xmath37 .",
    "one can actually prove that the integral can be negative only if @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the positive solution of the equation @xmath77 .",
    "we now analyze the other roots of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath69 be the root obtained from the maximum of @xmath36 at the right of @xmath78 by varying continuously @xmath37 from zero to some particular value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and to eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ( with @xmath79 ) , we conclude that the integrand in @xmath29 is negative for @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in principle , the real part of the dispersion function can be negative .",
    "however , one could imagine that the negative contribution for @xmath81 is compensated by a positive contribution corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "let us examine this possibility .",
    "using the fact that @xmath36 is even , we obtain @xmath83 for @xmath82 , we have @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , which can give the only negative contribution for @xmath29 , is negative provided @xmath87 which is impossible in the prescribed range of velocities , as @xmath88 by construction .",
    "therefore , we always have @xmath89 , where @xmath69 is the ( semi - classical ) root for eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) obtained from the positive maximum of @xmath36 , and the same argument holds for the symmetric root @xmath90 .",
    "this is analogous to the classical result shown above , according to which @xmath29 is positive at the two maxima of @xmath22 . indeed , the roots @xmath91 coincide with @xmath63 when @xmath62 .",

    "[ this is not in contradiction with the above statement that some equilibria only display three solutions to eq .",

    "for instance , for the particular choice of @xmath70 shown on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the region @xmath94 contributes a negative value to @xmath95 .",
    "the same is true for the root @xmath96 . this is because , over most of the region @xmath94 one has @xmath97 and @xmath98 , implying that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is negative .",
    "another choice of @xmath70 may have yielded the opposite result , so that the sign of @xmath95 can not be determined a priori .",
    "as the parameter @xmath37 depends on the wave number , it is always possible to choose @xmath2 so as to access a root of the type @xmath92 , for which the sign of @xmath29 is undetermined .",
    "the conclusion is that there is _ no _ quantum penrose functional , since the topology of the nyquist diagram can be changed , in an essential way , by the value of @xmath29 at the quantum roots for eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "each specific equilibrium must be studied in detail . in the following section",
    ", we shall illustrate the previous theory using some concrete examples .",
    "let us consider a two - humped equilibrium given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a measure of the dispersion of the distribution and @xmath101 is a parameter associated to the distance between the two possible maxima . if @xmath102 this bi - lorentzian distribution degenerates into a one - humped equilibrium , which is consequently stable against linear perturbations , both in classical and quantum cases .",
    "the major advantage of dealing with eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) is that it is amenable to exact calculations , thus providing an appropriate example of the use of the nyquist method for quantum plasmas .",
    "moreover , it models the physically relevant situation of two counterstreaming electron populations that co - exist within the same plasma .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we obtain the following solutions , @xmath103 it is easy to check that the roots given in eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) are always complex , whatever the values of @xmath37 , @xmath101 and @xmath100",
    ". however , the roots ( [ eq16 ] ) can be real , provided @xmath104 thus , there can be one or three relevant roots , according to condition ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "this inequality , when satisfied , can also be seen to imply @xmath105 , which is the same as the condition for the existence of two maxima .",
    "hence , there can be three real roots if and only if @xmath36 is two - humped , which is not surprising in view of the arguments given in the preceding section .    an equivalent and illuminating way to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) is @xmath106 where @xmath47 denotes the ( positive ) point where @xmath36 is maximum , @xmath107 hence , @xmath108 can not exceed the distance between the two maxima of @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqq18 ] ) can be real only if @xmath105 , that is , if there are two maxima , which is again a natural result . for very large quantum effects , only the root @xmath109 survives .",
    "as there is no quantum penrose functional , it is necessary to calculate @xmath29 at all possible roots ( [ eq15])-([eq16 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath110 which can be negative if and only if @xmath111 in addition , @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the positive - definite quantities @xmath115 we can show that eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) implies @xmath116 , so that @xmath29 as given by eq . ( [ eq21 ] )",
    "is indeed always positive .    in view of eqs .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) , we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for linear instability . that this condition is sufficient",
    "can be easily proven : suppose that we have found a wave number @xmath117 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) ; then any @xmath118 will also satisfy it ; by taking @xmath2 small enough , we can make the second addendum of eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) ( which is negative ) arbitrarily large in absolute value and therefore obtain @xmath31 .",
    "note , however , that putting an equality sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) and solving for @xmath2 does _ not _ provide the transition wave number between stable and unstable behavior . in order to obtain it , one has to set eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) to zero and solve for @xmath2 .    equation ( [ eq20 ] ) means that the plasma can become unstable for sufficiently large @xmath101 ( the two maxima are sufficiently far apart ) , small @xmath100 ( small dispersion ) or small @xmath37 ( small quantum effects ) .",
    "we also notice that , as @xmath37 depends on the wave number , quantum effects can suppress the instability for small wavelengths .",

    "remembering the dependence of @xmath37 on the wave - number and taking into account the explicit forms of @xmath150 and @xmath157 , it appears that the pair of conditions ( [ x2 ] ) are very complicated expressions of @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "using appropriated units in which @xmath158 , we were able to solve eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) numerically for a few values of @xmath14 ( measured in units of @xmath159 ) . for @xmath160",
    ", we found that the unstable modes satisfy @xmath161 , where @xmath2 is measured in units of @xmath162 .",
    "this is the classical condition for linear instability . for @xmath163 ,",
    "the instability range is given by @xmath164 .",
    "we see that the total band of instability becomes smaller for a non - zero planck s constant . further increasing @xmath14",
    ", taking @xmath165 , we found that the unstable linear waves must satisfy @xmath166 .",
    "for even larger quantum effects , there is virtually a suppression of all unstable modes .",
    "this is again in agreement with the numerical results of suh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where large quantum effects were shown to stabilize all classically unstable modes for a two - stream equilibrium .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the nyquist method for the study of the linear stability of spatially homogeneous quantum plasmas described by the wigner - poisson system . for classical vlasov - poisson plasmas",
    ", this method provides a simple way to analyze the stability properties . furthermore ,",
    "for the special case of two - stream equilibria , one can construct a simple functional ( known as penrose functional ) , whose sign determines whether unstable modes exist .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that the stability analysis of quantum plasmas is generally subtler than in the classical case . in particular",
    ", we have shown that no simple analogue of the penrose functional can be constructed in order to determine the stability properties of a two - humped equilibrium .",
    "hence , a detailed analysis is necessary for each particular case , with generic and universal conclusions being more difficult to obtain .",
    "however , we were able to prove that one - humped equilibria ( i.e. , with a distribution that is a monotonically decreasing function of the energy ) are always stable : this is the same result as for classical plasmas .",
    "the main mathematical reason for the subtler behavior of quantum plasmas is that the wave number now enters the real part of the dispersion function through the parameter @xmath167 .",
    "this can change the topology of the nyquist diagram , not only by varying @xmath14 , but also by varying the wave number at fixed @xmath14 .",
    "physically , this means that new unstable modes can arise by resonant interaction between the quantum velocity @xmath37 and some other typical plasma velocity . indeed ,",
    "such purely quantum unstable modes have been observed @xcite for the special case of two - stream equilibrium @xmath168 where @xmath113 is the dirac delta function and @xmath169 the velocities of each stream .",
    "this equilibrium can be amenable to exact calculation @xcite .",
    "even when general or exact results can not be obtained , the nyquist technique can be successfully used for the study of particular equilibria , as was shown in section iv . the bi - lorentzian equilibrium treated in that section",
    "has shown that large quantum effects generally contribute to stabilize perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is not always the case , however , and we have produced an explicit example of a wave number that is classically stable and becomes unstable for finite @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the nyquist method has enabled us to derive an exact stability criterion for such a bi - lorentzian equilibrium .",
    "the nyquist technique was also applied to a classically unstable bump - in - tail equilibrium .",
    "again , large quantum effects were shown to reduce the range of unstable wave numbers .    *",
