    "when a thermal pressure of the heat , resulting from the sequence of nuclear fusion reactions taking place in a star , can not longer balance the gravitational attraction , the last stage of a massive star evolution begins . for sufficiently massive stars ( mass @xmath3@xmath4 )",
    ", the collapse of their iron core with a mass exceeding the chandrasekhar limit creates a type ii supernova ( sn ) , which explosion is an intense source of neutrinos .",
    "it is estimated that , about @xmath599% of the sn type ii binding energy ( about @xmath510@xmath6 erg ) is radiated as ( anti)neutrinos of all flavors .",
    "the sn neutrino flux is so enormous , that even ( anti)neutrino signals from sn explosions outside our galaxy can be detected on the earth .",
    "up to now , there was only one case of a detection of extra - solar system neutrinos , namely neutrinos from the sn1987a , which had exploded in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "two terrestrial detectors , kamiokande - ii  @xcite and imb  @xcite , were able to observe 20 events of the sn1987a neutrino interactions in total .",
    "this observation confirms the main features of the mechanism of the stellar evolution .",
    "the number of observed neutrino events , in the terrestrial detectors , and their energy spectrum depend on : ( 1 ) the assumed neutrino production fluxes , ( 2 ) the changes in neutrino fluxes due to the neutrino flavor mixing ( oscillations ) in both , the supernova and in the earth , and ( 3 ) the detector properties - including detection efficiency and the dead time .",
    "all these effects were taken into account in our calculations of the electron and positron energy spectra from the sn1987a neutrino interactions in kamiokande - ii and imb detectors ( these detectors were not able to distinguish between electrons and positrons ) , presented in this paper .",
    "for the purpose of our simulations , we assume that the distance between the sn1987a and the earth is 52kpc and that the total energy emitted in the core collapse of the star in form of ( anti)neutrinos is @xmath7 .",
    "we focus on the spectral characteristics of the time - integrated ( anti)neutrinos fluxes .",
    "the detailed spectral shape of the production fluences is not well known .",
    "such fluxes are often expressed in the form of fermi - dirac distributions with the chemical potential equal to zero ( see also  @xcite ) , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represents the energy of ( anti)neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath16 is the total energy released in various flavors of ( anti)neutrinos ( @xmath17 , where an equipartition of the energy emitted in different species is assumed ) , the @xmath18 is the temperature of the @xmath19 gas in the ( anti)neutrino sphere . in our calculations , we assume the following , `` standard '' , hierarchy of temperatures : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 mean @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "these temperatures corresponds to the following , approximate average values of the neutrino energies : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    using a nominal fermi - dirac distribution to approximate the spectrum",
    "is physically motivated because a truly thermal neutrino flux would follow this behavior .",
    "numerical simulations of the supernova explosion suggest , however , that the production fluences can be `` pinched '' , meaning that their low- and high - energy parts are suppressed relative to the fermi - dirac spectrum of the same average energy .",
    "therefore , we consider also an alternative `` analytic fit function ''  @xcite for which analytic simplicity is the main motivation , @xmath32 where @xmath15 is the energy of ( anti)neutrinos , @xmath33 is the total energy released , @xmath34 is the average energy and @xmath35 is the amount of spectral pinching .    in our analysis ,",
    "we sum up the spectra coming from the two phases of the supernova explosion , the `` accretion '' phase in which ( about ) 10% of the total @xmath36 is released , and the `` cooling '' phase in which the remaining 90% of the @xmath36 is released .",
    "the values of parameters , that we use , were extracted from the garching group paper  @xcite and are given in table  [ tab.keil ] .       it can be seen that none of the simulated spectra , obtained with any of the considered neutrino production energy spectra , and any of the mass hierarchy and @xmath37 combinations , agrees satisfactorily with the measured distributions .",
    "the agreement is slightly better for the imb spectra , especially for the `` analytic fit function '' neutrino production spectra .",
    "moreover , with the current neutrino mixing parameters , the different earth matter effects ( i.e.  the different distances traveled by neutrinos in the earth ) can not also explain the qualitative differences in the observed kamiokande - ii and imb spectra .",
    "in fact , as we have already noticed in  @xcite , the earth matter effects have almost no influence on the expected total number of neutrino interactions @xmath38 in detectors , nor on the predicted event spectra , except on distances below about 2500 km , where some variations within 3.5% ( 1.5% ) , for the fermi - dirac ( `` analytic fit function '' ) neutrino production spectrum exist ( one gets the highest numbers of events when neutrinos do not cross the earth at all ) .",
    "the shape of all four ( dl , il , ds and is ) simulated @xmath39 and @xmath40 energy spectra is very similar .",
    "however , the number of the expected events is considerably higher ( and the spectrum is harder ) for the il case than for the remaining three , for which the distributions are practically identical ( note also that , all these numbers scale linearly with the assumed total energy @xmath36 released in form of ( anti)neutrinos , and are inversely proportional to the square of the assumed distance to the supernova )",
    ".    the next generations of neutrino experiments , with much bigger detectors , and improved detection techniques , should be able to observe future supernova neutrino bursts , and not only confirm the main features of the sn mechanism , but also to allow for more precise tests of sn models .",
