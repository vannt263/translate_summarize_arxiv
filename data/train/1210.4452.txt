    "we investigated adiabatic charge and spin pumping through an interacting quantum dot driven out of equilibrium by a non - linear bias voltage and time - dependent parameter modulations .",
    "we showed that , regardless of the specific modulation , the time - resolved adiabatic charge and spin currents can be interpreted as the response to a perturbation in the instantaneous average charge and spin due to the variation of the driving parameters .",
    "this allowed us to identify the charge and spin emissivities to the leads in the context of interacting systems in the non - linear transport regime .    for the specific case of a modulation of the gate and bias voltage , we discussed the conditions for interaction - induced pumping in terms of the properties of vector fields associated to the adiabatic charge and spin currents .",
    "we observed that the coulomb interaction is crucial since it gives the rotational contribution to the pseudo vector potential that can not be gauged away : it generates a nonzero pseudo magnetic field and in consequence a finite pumped charge . for a single - level quantum dot",
    ", we explored the stability diagram associated to this vector field for arbitrary bias and junction asymmetry .",
    "the shape of the pseudo magnetic field reflects the two - parameter condition required for adiabatic pumping , such that it shows a maximum whenever _ two _ lines of the usual @xmath345 stability diagram meet .",
    "the analytic expressions for the pseudo magnetic field and the pumped charge enable detailed fitting of experimental results . for low bias voltages ,",
    "the pumping mechanism is dominated by the change in the response coefficient when exploring different regions of the pumping cycle . in constrast , in the high - bias regime , the finite pumped charge is generated by the cooperative effect of the above mechanism and the junction asymmetry .",
    "this allows for a direct quantitative determination of the junction asymmetry by two measurements of the pumped charge .",
    "the role of the external magnetic field was found to be twofold : first , it restores at low bias the loading / unloading symmetry previously broken by the local interaction in combination with the spin - degeneracy .",
    "this is evidenced by a suppression of the pumped charge at zero bias .",
    "second , in addition to the pumped charge , a pumped spin arises once the spin degeneracy is effectively recovered through an applied bias .",
    "in particular , the weak dependence of the pumped spin on the junction asymmetry allows for pure spin pumping in the high - bias regime .",

    "although not exact anymore for multi - level quantum - dots , we expect similar qualitative correspondences to hold in general .",
