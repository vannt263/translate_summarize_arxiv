    "a common textbook quantum physics / chemistry approach to solving the schrdinger equation in those cases where no analytical solution is available is to utilize matrix mechanics @xcite . in atomic and molecular electronic structure calculations , it is often important to go beyond the independent - particle approximation , and thus some numerical machinery is required .",
    "vast numbers of quantum mechanical research problems that are amenable to solution have been solved using matrix mechanics , one good example being for instance the study of electrons on a small lattice @xcite .",
    "one decomposes the wave function into a complete set of well known basis states    @xmath0    where the @xmath1 s are the unknown coefficients . inserting this into the time - independent schrdinger equation , and undergoing inner products with the same basis states",
    "yields the eigenvalue equation    @xmath2    where the matrix elements are given by    @xmath3    usually , one just simply truncates the expansion to include only the low - lying bound states .",
    "if the basis is reasonably chosen , a few states are required to provide satisfactory results .",
    "we have to mention that some studies @xcite have shown that basis set truncation error is of more importance than truncation of the corresponding perturbation series .",
    "however , we will not be dealing with such situation here .    in the present contribution we shall tackle the unexplained behavior of the matrix formalism depending on the hamiltonian of a problem . in section ii",
    "we introduce a model hamiltonian in two dimensions . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical approach reached where the matrix formalism works perfectly well .",
    "the introduction of a brand new system possessing analytical solution is done in section iv , which constitutes a terrible unexplained failure of the method of basis expansion .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "we shall provide here a simple system of two interacting spin - less electrons . let us suppose that we have two concentric rings .",
    "electron 1 is located on the inner ring of radius @xmath4 and electron 2 is located on the outer ring of radius @xmath5 .",
    "positions are determined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we shall assume @xmath8 .",
    "the distance between them is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation with electrons interacting via coulomb potential reads as    @xmath10    where @xmath11 .",
    "the solution is obviously periodic @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "this case is quasi - exactly solvable by using the distance between particles as a new variable @xcite .",
    "we shall test our numerical procedure with one exact case in order to check the validity of our approach to the problem .",
    "one easy way of preserving periodicity is to span the solution @xmath15 in the basis of non - interacting two particles , one in each ring , and then truncate the expansion to @xmath16 terms , @xmath17 even .",
    "that is ,    @xmath18    had we considered concentric spheres , we should be dealing with spherical harmonics . plugging ( [ spanned ] ) into ( [ equation ] ) , multiplying by @xmath19 and integrating over @xmath20 returns    @xmath21\\,c_{k , l}\\,=\\,0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath22 .",
    "let us regard @xmath23 the first line in ( [ set ] ) .",
    "solving ( [ set ] ) for @xmath24 is tantamount as providing an approximate solution to ( [ equation ] ) for the ground or excited states , increasing the accuracy when augmenting the number of terms in the expansion @xmath16 .",
    "the matrix element in ( [ set ] ) reads explicitly as    @xmath25    the set of eqs .",
    "( [ set ] ) for @xmath24 does not read yet as a standard eigenvalue problem .",
    "usual approaches to matrix quantum mechanics deal with only one quantum number , either because the instances addressed are one - dimensional problems or physical scenarios with higher spatial dimensions but characterized with only one principal quantum number . we have to point out that when this is not the case , not a single textbook explains , to our knowledge , how to proceed .    in order to tackle the problem given by ( [ set ] ) , we shall transform @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 using @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 . notice that by doing so , the problem increases significantly the effective total dimension of the ensuing eigenvalue problem .",
    "also , it is straightforward to extend the previous linear mapping of indexes to more quantum numbers if required .",
    "however , if that was the case , the final computational problem becomes quite involved .    with the previous transformation",
    ", we have the usual eigenvalue and eigenvector problem    @xmath32    and @xmath33 .",
    "finding the corresponding eigenvalues will give as the energy spectrum of the system . in order to find the eigenvectors ,",
    "the inverse transformation @xmath34 can be proved to be unique . in other words ,",
    "given @xmath35 and @xmath17 , we find a sole couple ( @xmath36 ) . in practice",
    ", we have to solve a linear diophantine equation .    in order to validate our numerical results",
    ", we can compare with the analytic case of two concentric rings @xcite .",
    "results are shown in table i. the matching is perfect .",
    ".solution coefficients @xmath24 for the analytic case @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "numerical ground energy is virtually @xmath41 to exact energy @xmath42 .",
    "notice the symmetry in the indexes @xmath36 and in the numerical value of @xmath24 .",
    "as we can appreciate , only 11 coefficients @xmath24 in the expansion suffice to find the right solution .",
    "see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     thus , having seen how well the truncation basis method works for electrons interacting via coulomb repulsion as opposed to particles under hooke s law , it is tantalizing to conclude that spanning the solution to the schrdinger equation in the natural basis of the concomitant non - interacting system is not enough to ensure the correctness of that solution .",
    "however , if we compare the ground state wave function obtained via basis truncation _ and _ the exact one for the hypersphere when @xmath43 , which is analytic @xcite as well , they have exactly the same behavior , with no nodes at either @xmath44 .    therefore , we can appreciate an anomaly as far as matrix quantum mechanics is concerned when regarding systems interacting via hooke s law .",
    "the plane wave approximation seems to be valid only for coulomb interaction , but not for the harmonic oscillator * unless * we go to a specific dimension ( concentric hyperspheres ) , where the approach becomes exact .",
    "we have presented two simple yet non - trivial quantum physics systems where the nature of the hamiltonian defines whether the matrix formalism is correct or not . by definition ,",
    "spanning the solution of the schrdinger equation in a complete basis is an exact problem , regardless of the hamiltonian involved . in the present contribution",
    "we provide an example of a system where the correctness of the formalism works well for a coulomb interaction , whereas for a harmonic oscillator type it does net reach any satisfactory solution .",
    "this problem has interesting echoes not only in unveiling the details of the matrix formalism in quantum physics with more than one particle , but also in the fact that there exists an inconsistency which can not be accounted for .",
    "incidentally , the counterexample provided constitutes a new system not considered previously in the past .",
    "it is imperative to stress the fact that no errors due to truncation have to be considered because the approximation is extremely accurate .",

    "j. batle also appreciates fruitful discussions with pierre - francois loos ."
