    "quantum information has been traditionally built around two - state quantum systems representing quantum bits ( qubits).@xcite in order to perform operations on a single or multiple qubits , qubit states must interact with control fields and with the fields that mediate the interaction . the control is typically done by a classical ( coherent state ) bosonic field , such as laser or microwave field that drives the evolution of the system.@xcite classical control , however , is insufficient to generate entanglement .",
    "the qubit states must interact with one another via a quantum field , such as an optical or a microwave cavity mode .",
    "thus , quantum two - qubit operations result from a combination of classical control and ( quantum ) physical interaction between the qubits.@xcite    traditionally , in many quantum computing systems@xcite the focus was on either coupling qubit transitions directly to the cavity mode by tuning them into the resonance or by coupling the qubits indirectly via a third state ( @xmath0-system ) , eliminating the latter from the evolution.@xcite in both cases , the system is carried through a resonance condition either by driving the system with external control fields or by slow modification of system parameters with time .",
    "a qubit system typically has multiple distinct quantum states above the two states that are used to encode the qubit .",
    "these states can also be used to manipulate qubits performing single - qubit gates ( e.g. , via a @xmath0-system @xcite ) or two - qubit gates @xcite . unlike earlier two - qubit gate schemes , in which auxiliary states play a role , the approach we use here is based on a regime of operation that is common to most qubit - cavity systems . in this paper we generalize our earlier derivations made for specific systems@xcite and show that active control of populations of additional ( auxiliary ) states can be beneficial in constructing various two - qubit operations . to this end , we demonstrate how our results can be applied to a superconducting transmon - based system@xcite that differs substantially from the optically - controlled systems@xcite investigated earlier ( see fig .",

    "we focus on two - qubit entangling operations and demonstrate that efficient two - qubit gates can be performed by driving the system along certain trajectories through excited states of the qubit - cavity system using a set of a few simple local pulses .    while the spectrum of _ each _ individual system representing a qubit is specific to the physics of that system , the spectrum of _ two _ such qubit systems interacting with a cavity mode has a structure that is common to many physical realizations .",
    "when the cavity mode is detuned far from transitions in the qubit systems , it can not effectively mediate an interaction , and the qubits remain isolated from one another . in this case",
    "only single - qubit operations are possible .",
    "when the cavity mode frequency is in resonance with transitions in both qubit systems , non - local ( entangled ) superpositions of states form and entanglement can be manipulated . at that time , single - qubit operations become difficult .",
    "we show that in the intermediate regime of resonance when the qubits are already sufficiently isolated , the auxiliary excited states can still develop substantial non - local superpositions , which can be used to perform two - qubit entangling operations .",
