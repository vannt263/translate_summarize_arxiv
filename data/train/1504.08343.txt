    "finally , we showed that selecting hospitals as sensors based on their in - degree in the static network was able to detect a large fraction of infections .",
    "furthermore , an activation time of just 5 to 7 days using the dynamic sensor implementation is sufficient to achieve this surveillance with just 2% of the hospitals acting as sensors .",
    "these results support our conceptual model that the structure of the nationwide hospital patient transfer network is important for the spread of health - care associated infections , likely well beyond the illustrative case of c. diff considered here . in particular , our work highlights the need to monitor the network of transfers not just individual hospitals in order to monitor infectious outbreaks .",
    "it is possible that other sorts of pathogens might need a different number of sensor hospitals , a different set of sensor hospitals , or different surveillance windows .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the health of the entire hospital system , from the perspective of nosocomial infections or other outbreaks , could be monitored by leveraging the network structure of patient transfers .",
    "our study has several limitations .",
    "first , the data we used to map the hospital networks are from 2006 and 2007 . however , given that hospital transfer patterns are strongly embedded in the geography of the country , as we also demonstrated here , we do not expect the age of the data to affect our results substantially .",
    "second , we can not assess the extent to which unobserved policies or commercial constraints might have affected the flow of patients from one hospital to another ; however , these policies merely affected patient transfers , which are , in any case , observable in the current and similar future data .",
    "third , our analyses and models assume that patient transfers are the only mechanism responsible for the spread of infections .",
    "there are , of course , other vectors or means that might result in hospitals being infected , such as the movement of physicians , nurses , and other health care staff between hospitals .",
    "finally , in this analysis , we did not make use of the fine - scale temporal information available in transfer data ; future work could evaluate how bursts of infected patients , perhaps on particular days of the week , might contribute to an epidemic .",
    "understanding the structure and dynamics of the hospital transfer network for the spread of real infections has a number of important implications .",
    "empirical data could be used , either periodically or perhaps even in real time to map networks of patient movement in the us health care system , and this network could then be used monitor the spread of nosocomial and other infections in the network . in our estimation , such a system could detect 80% of _ c.  diff .",
    "_ cases using just 2% of hospitals as network sensors .",
    "our methods suggest practicable strategies for identifying which hospitals should serve a surveillance function for the whole system and , in the dynamic implementation , how long the sensors should retain a higher level of alertness after each index case .",
    "these tools would be useful not only for public health interventions in the case of natural epidemics , but also in the case of deliberate ones , such as those due to a possible bioterror attack . in conclusion ,",
    "the actual structure and flow pattern of patients across us hospitals confers certain specific vulnerabilities and defenses , regardless of the biology of the pathogen per se , placing theoretical bounds on any effective containment strategy directed at a contagious pathogen .",
    "we study hospital - to - hospital transfer patterns of the entire population of us medicare patients over a two - year period .",
    "medicare provides almost universal coverage to all americans aged 65 and older , about 15% of the us population @xcite ; and about 37% of all hospital admissions in 2003 were for medicare patients @xcite .",
    "we used a 100% sample of the medicare provider analysis and review ( medpar ) files for calendar years 2006 and 2007 .",
    "the medpar files contain diagnosis , procedure , and billing information on all inpatient and skilled nursing facility ( snf ) stays .",
    "our study cohort consisted of medicare patients aged 65 or older with a hospital stay at an acute medical or surgical hospital with an active record in the american hospital association ( aha ) 2005 database @xcite . before applying these exclusion criteria , we identified 26.4 million stays of 12.5 million patients in 6,278 different hospitals .",
    "after the exclusions , our final cohort consisted of 21.0 million inpatient stays of 10.4 million patients in 5,667 different hospitals .      according to our definition ,",
    "a hospital - to - hospital transfer occurs whenever a patient is discharged from one hospital and admitted to another hospital on the same calendar day .",
    "note that a minority of transfers as defined here may not correspond to actual formal transfers of patients .",
    "for example , a patient could be discharged from hospital a and then be re - admitted to hospital b on the same day for a reason that is unrelated to her stay at hospital a. from an epidemiological point of view , however , these are essentially equivalent to formal patient transfers .",
    "( our results change little if we relax the definition of hospital transfers to allow the re - admission to take place the day following the day of discharge .",

    "we consider a network representation of the patient transfers across hospitals . in this framework , hospitals are represented as nodes and a transfer of a total of @xmath9 patients on day @xmath10 from hospital @xmath11 to hospital @xmath12 is represented as a directed edge from node @xmath11 to node @xmath12 with weight @xmath9 on day @xmath10 .",
    "the longitudinal sequence of patient transfers forms a directed , weighted , temporal network .",
    "we consider a static representation of the network that retains no temporal information of patient transfers by aggregating the data for the two - year period , where the weight of the edge from node @xmath11 to node @xmath12 is the mean daily number of patient transfers through that edge , i.e. , the total number of transfers from hospital @xmath11 to hospital @xmath12 during the study period divided by the number of days in the period ( 730 ) .",

    ".      it might be possible to make use of the properties of the hospital - hospital transfer network to set up a real - time surveillance system for infections , such as a new strain of antibiotic - resistant _ c.  diff .",
    "_ for this application , it is unlikely that exhaustive data would be available for all hospitals all the time , and this limitation calls for a parsimonious approach where only a subset of hospitals needs to be monitored at any given time .",
    "we call these monitored hospitals `` network sensors '' in the sense that they could be used to sense incipient epidemics .",
    "we consider three different prescriptions for sensor placement : ( 1 ) choose sensor hospitals in proportion to their in - degree rank in the static network ; ( 2 ) choose sensor hospitals in proportion to their out - degree rank in the static network ; and ( 3 ) choose sensor hospitals uniformly at random from the set of all hospitals . in our simulations ,",
    "we assume that a monitored hospital is able to detect every infected patient who is present either in the hospital itself or in any of its network neighbors to which it is connected via patient transfers .",
    "while this assumption is made primarily for methodological reasons and may not hold in practice , the relative performance ( the ordering ) of the three prescriptions for selecting sensors remains unaffected if the assumption were relaxed . to learn about the potential of the hospital sensor framework to detect epidemics ,",
    "we investigate its best - case performance by determining the optimal sensor set for the observed data ( see appendices ) .",
    "we expect that its performance would be somewhat reduced for an independent test data set ( data not used as part of the training of the method ) .",
    "we define the relative efficacy of the sensor @xmath13 set as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of sensors in the sensor set , @xmath16 the number of infected patients detected by a sensor set of @xmath15 sensors , and @xmath17 is the total number of _ c.  diff .",
    "_ cases in the network . while adding sensors to the system always improves its overall performance , any sensor set exhibits diminishing marginal returns in the sense that the per - sensor increment in performance declines with each added sensor .",
    "the first term in the definition corresponds to the number of detected cases normalized by the number of cases that would be detected if all sensors were as efficacious as the first sensor in the sensor set .",
    "the second term is a penalty term that corresponds to the fraction of undetected cases .",
    "high relative efficacy is therefore a combination of selecting a set of sensors that are as close as possible to the efficaciousness of the first sensor in the set and having these sensors miss as small a proportion of cases as possible .",
    "note that the two terms in the definition of the relative efficacy could be assigned different weights ; however , here , we opted for the simplest approach and only ensured that the two contributions are measured on the same scale .",
    "we implement the sensor framework in two different ways . in the static implementation , the sensors are always active , whereas , in the dynamic implementation , the sensors are either passive or active .",
    "when a sensor is passive , it can only detect infections in the hospital itself . whenever an infection is detected , the sensor either transitions from the passive state to the active state for a period of @xmath4 days or , if already in the active state , remains in that state for another @xmath4 days .",
    "in addition to the efficacy of the sensor sets , for both implementations , we keep track of the fraction of _ c.  diff .",
    "_ cases that are detected in order to assess the performance of the sensor system .    *",
    "static implementation * since we know the number of _ c.  diff .",
    "_ cases in each hospital at any given time , we simply count the number of cases in the sensor hospitals and their network neighbors .",
    "we average the results by generating 10,000 independent realizations of sensor sets for each of the three different prescriptions of choosing sensors ( in - degree , out - degree , random ) .",
    "the optimal sensor set for each strategy is the one with maximum efficacy .",
    "* dynamic implementation * we monitor the admission times of _ c.  diff .",
    "_ patients at each hospital , and whenever such a patient is admitted , we incorporate the hospital in the sensor set for @xmath4 days following the admission , a time period we call the activation time . once added to the sensor set , the hospital can detect the _ c.  diff .",
    "_ cases present in the hospital itself and its network neighbors for a total of @xmath4 days .",
    "the efficacy of the sensor system therefore depends on the value of @xmath4 , and we compute the efficacy of the sensors for @xmath4 from 0 to 100 days ( shown from 0 to 30 days in fig .",

    "jfg and jpo are joint first authors of this article .",
    "we characterize the temporal nature of hospital usage by showing the time series of the number of transfers in figure [ figs1 ] ( a ) .",
    "a clear seasonal oscillation is visible , and at a finer temporal scale , a weekly periodic cycle is also observable , where saturdays and sundays are the least active days of the week and mondays the most active and also the most variable . in figure [ figs1 ] ( b )",
    "there are periodic oscillations in many of the quantities of interest , such as the number of patients staying overnight at hospitals , number of admissions , discharges , and transfers .",
    "we then examine the structural connectivity and geographic characteristics of the static transfer network ( see fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] ) . in terms of network topology ,",
    "the in - degree distribution has a broader tail than the out - degree distribution .",
    "the network has an average ( local ) clustering coefficient of 0.51 .",
    "this coefficient measures the probability that any two hospitals connected to an index hospital are in turn connected to each other , forming a closed triad ( a cycle of three nodes and three edges ) . a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges yields an average local clustering coefficient of 0.0057@xmath0 0.0001 ( se ) , which is substantially lower than the observed value , a finding that likely reflects the network s geographic embeddedness .",
    "the average shortest path length of the network is 4.69 . to put this number in perspective",
    ", we performed network randomizations using a slight variant of the directed configuration model that preserves both in - degree and out - degree distributions @xcite .",
    "this approach gave rise to an average shortest path length of 3.6 @xmath0 0.4 ( se ) .",
    "the observed network is therefore a somewhat `` larger world '' than what would be expected by chance , but this is almost certainly driven by the underlying geography and the objective of keeping transfers as short as possible .",
    "in fact , about 90% of the transfers are to hospitals less than 200 km away .",
    "degree assortativity is the concept that nodes with many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections @xcite .",
    "when the static network is taken as undirected , we can use the assortativity coefficient to measure the extent to which the degrees of hospitals in each pair of connected hospitals are similar .",
    "we obtain a slightly negative value of -0.06 , but similar values of -0.005 @xmath0 0.001 ( se ) also arise from randomizations of the network using the algorithm discussed above . consequently , there is no statistically significant assortativity in the network over and above what would be expected by chance given the network s degree distributions .",
    "since the patient transfers are not explicit in the data but instead need to be inferred from the data , we investigated the robustness of some of the results to our definition of what constitutes a hospital transfer . instead of requiring readmission on the day of discharge , we relaxed this definition by allowing the readmission to take place also on the day after discharge .",
    "a visual examination of fig . [ figs3 ] shows that the edges induced by the same - day rule ( red edges ) and the additional edges that result using the relaxed rule ( blue edges ) . this relaxation leads to 67472 additional transfers ( 7.2% increase ) .",
    "there are 11827 new edges that appear on the transfer network ( 15.6% increase ) , with an average transfer load of 1.2 with a standard deviation of 0.7 . for the connections that appear under both rules , the difference in transfer loads averages to 0.7 transfers with a standard deviation of 1.9 .",
    "the distribution of edge weights for both cases are shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] , and the two distributions appear visually very similar to one another . the weight distribution of the additional edges , as well as the distribution of weight differences for the common edges in both cases can be seen in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] .",
    "the range of this distribution is much more constrained than that of the actual weight distributions .",
    "the number of transfers increases , but the patterns remain essentially the same both temporally and topologically . for the temporal patterns ,",
    "see the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] .",
    "note also that both measures of transfers are strictly speaking wrong , as the first one based on the one - day rule is really a lower bound on the number of transfers and the second one ( based on the relaxed rule ) is an upper bound .",
    "given the similarity of these findings across the two rules , in the following we work with the lower bound ( same day discharge and readmission ) .",
    "we determine the best sensor set we could have possibly chosen given the observed data . in order to do this , we use greedy algorithms @xcite as checking all possible combinations of hospitals to use as sensors grows exponentially in the number of hospitals and is therefore not feasible for any but the smallest hospital transfer networks . for a fast algorithm that is not guaranteed to give the optimal answer ( as is true with any heuristic algorithm ) , we choose the sensors sequentially .",
    "we first compute the number of cases each hospital would detect and we choose the one that will detect the highest number of cases .",
    "we then re - compute how many new cases would be covered by each subsequent hospital if added to the existing sensor set .",
    "this continues until we find the sensor set that covers all cases . as mentioned above",
    ", this procedure does not guarantee that we will choose the optimal sensor set given a number of sensors n , but it is however very efficient and yields an effective sensor set not far from the optimal one . in order to check that",
    "our solution is sufficiently close to the actual best solution , we used simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "the simulated annealing procedure is suitable for optimization problems of large scale , especially ones where a desired global extremum is hidden among many , poorer , local extrema .",
    "there is an objective function to be minimized , in our case the coverage of cases to be maximized , but the space over which that function is defined is not simply the n - dimensional space of n continuously variable parameters .",
    "rather , it is a discrete , but very large , configuration space with the number of elements factorially large , so that they can not be explored exhaustively .",
    "this result is in agreement with the result of the fast sequential algorithm .    in fig .",
    "[ figs5 ] we show the results of finding the sensor set that maximizes the number of detected cases in the training dataset for the static network case .",
    "this method is data - based and tries to maximize the number of detected cases without the use of any strategy of choosing sensors other than the optimization procedure . in this case",
    "we find that for a very small number of 26 ( 0.46% ) sensors , we can detect 88% of the cases .",
    "this very high performance is however likely a consequence of over - fitting the model to the observed ( training ) data .",
    "using this set of hospitals as sensors for a new dataset on patient transfers would likely result in lower ( and more variable ) performance of the sensor system .      in fig .",
    "[ figs6 ] we can see the results of performing the same analysis for the dynamic implementation . now the hospitals that are sensors act only as sensors for a period t days after admitting a patient with a c.diff infection . the greedy method for choosing sensors works as in the static case , but now taking into account the temporal restrictions for the cases that the sensor system is able to detect .",
    "the result is similar to the results of the other methods when moving from the static to the dynamic case .",
    "the results are different for a small value of the activation time , below one week , but remain basically unchanged as the activation time is raised .",
    "thte performance of statistical methods is generally quantified using some error metric , and most fitting procedures attempt to minimize this error in the process of finding suitable values for model parameters .",
    "it is often possible to reduce this training error by increasing model complexity , but generally the goal of modeling is to have the model perform well on a test data set , ideally an independent data set , that the model was not trained on",
    ". good performance on a test data set , quantified by a low test error , generally leads to better overall model performance and avoids the problem of over fitting , which refers to the model adapting to the test data `` too well '' at the expense of poor generalizability to different realizations of data from the same data generating mechanism .    in analogy with this approach to statistical learning",
    ", we performed a series of analyses to investigate the performance of sensor sets derived from one set of data and tested on another .",
    "the objective of the analysis is twofold .",
    "first , it will enable us to ascertain the validity of our methods when applied to training data , i.e. , data not used to select the set of sensors .",
    "two , given that there are likely temporal correlations in the data , it enables us to study the performance of sensor sets on data that are temporally far removed from the training data .",
    "here we divided our data to disjoint ( non - overlapping ) windows of width",
    "l , where we used values of 1 month , 2 months , 4 months , 6 months , and a year for l. for any given window , we take the first window to be our training data and use all subsequent windows as different realizations of test data .",
    "we used the training data for generating the sensor sets ( based on in - degree , out - degree , and the greedy algorithm ; we exclude considerations of the random stragy here because there is no real distinction between testing and training ) and evaluated the relative efficacy and the percentage of cases detected separately for each test data window .",
    "although intuitively it seems that the sensor sets would perform worse the greater the temporal separation between the training window and test window , we found that our methods were robust against this separation .",
    "little variation is observed as the validation window gets more and more separated temporally from the training window that was used to construct the sensor sets ( see figs .",
    "[ figs8]-  [ figs10 ] ) .",
    "this is counterintuitive especially for the sensor set obtained using the greedy algorithm because in principle we are over - fitting our model to the data and consequently this should result in more variability .",
    "nevertheless , temporal correlations in the dynamics of the system make it well behaved in this sense .",
    "an important lesson here is that it is possible to determine efficient sensor sets even using outdated data .",
    "[ [ effect - of - the - length - of - the - observation - period - on - the - sensor - set - evaluation ] ] effect of the length of the observation period on the sensor set evaluation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the validation set approach also enables us to evaluate how the construction of a sensor set is affected by the width of the window used in its construction . from the results in fig .

    "<S> we investigate a network induced by the transfer of medicare patients across us hospitals over a 2-year period to learn about the possible role of hospital - to - hospital transfers of patients in the spread of infections . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze temporal , geographical , and topological properties of the transfer network and demonstrate , using c.  diff .  as a case study , that this network may serve as a substrate for the spread of infections . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study different strategies for the early detection of incipient epidemics , finding that using approximately 2% of hospitals as sensors , chosen based on their network in - degree , results in optimal performance for this early warning system , enabling the early detection of 80% of the c.  diff </S>",
    "<S> .  cases .    every year in the us alone , there are 1.7 million nosocomial infections and 99,000 associated deaths , imposing substantial clinical and financial costs to the us health care system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of these are due to antibiotic - resistant bacteria @xcite , which have a natural reservoir in hospitals , presenting a potentially lethal threat to already - sick patients . </S>",
    "<S> the annual cost of antibiotic - resistant infections in the us has been estimated to range from $ 21 billion to $ 34 billion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a 2013 cdc ( centers for disease control and prevention ) report on antibiotic - resistant bacteria identified the lack of infrastructure to detect and respond to emerging resistant infections as a pressing gap .    </S>",
    "<S> antibiotic - resistant organisms have a natural reservoir in hospitals . in our study , over a two - year period , there were nearly one million transfer events across us hospitals of medicare patients alone . given this large number of transfers , the network of patient transfers could plausibly act as a conduit for antibiotic - resistant bacteria from hospital to hospital . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , only a few existing studies that have investigated the possible role of hospital - to - hospital transfers of patients for the spread of infections . </S>",
    "<S> some studies have focused on the structure of the nationwide transfer network associated with critical care @xcite , while others have had a more restricted scope , limited to smaller geographical units , such as counties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> local containment of antibiotic - resistant bacteria at the level of individual hospitals is a difficult but manageable task given that interactions between hospital wards are relatively structured and confined spatially @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but controlling a larger epidemic of antibiotic - resistant bacteria or responding to new mass outbreaks is much more challenging . </S>",
    "<S> this is in part related to the complex pattern of patient movements between hospitals , which gives rise to a broad , distributed network . to better understand the role of patient transfers for the spread of infections , we pursue three interconnected aims </S>",
    "<S> first , we investigate the structure of the hospital - to - hospital patient transfer network in the us ; second , we correlate the incidence of nosocomial infections on a national scale with properties of this network ; and third , we develop a scalable method for the efficient early detection of the spread of nosocomial infections .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with structural analyses by first aggregating patient transfers over time to create hospital - to - hospital connections ( `` edges '' ) in the network , and we then examine static structural properties of this network . </S>",
