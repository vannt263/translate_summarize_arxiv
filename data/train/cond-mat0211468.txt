    "gene expression in all organisms comprises the transcription of a certain gene on the dna into messenger rna ( mrna ) through rna polymerase starting from the promoter site , and its subsequent translation into a protein .",
    "the initiation of the transcription at a specific gene underlies a subtle cooperative scheme of transcription factors , which in turn is determined by a given set of boundary conditions such as the concentration of the transcription factors .",
    "transcription factors often act cooperatively , and they are known to interact with each other over distances of several thousand base pairs ( bp ) .",
    "this interaction is effected through dna looping , compare fig .",

    "a key component of this @xmath4 switch is the @xmath4 repressor which activates the expression of a gene that encodes the production of the @xmath4 repressor itself .",
    "@xmath4 repressor can bind to the three operator sites o@xmath5 which overlap the two promoter sites of the switch .",
    "@xmath4 repressor binds cooperatively as a dimer , and typically under stable lysogenic conditions two such dimers on o@xmath5 form a tetramer , the next higher order of cooperativity , which is the main factor for the stability of the @xmath4 switch against noise @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath4 repressor can also bind to the very similar operator o@xmath6 , which is located roughly 2300 bp away and not part of the @xmath4 switch .",
    "it has been found that the two @xmath4 repressor tetramers at o@xmath6 and o@xmath5 synergistically form an octamer through dna looping .",
    "this higher - ordered oligomerisation enhances the performance of the switch considerably @xcite .",
    "the specific binding along the tetramer - tetramer interface has recently been revealed through crystallographic structure determination @xcite .",
    "similar realisations of dna looping also occur in linear dna , naturally in the form of telomeres or in vitro in engineered dna , compare fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "multiple looping in large dna molecules around a locus can be observed in vivo and can be induced in vitro by introducing of specific binding zones on the dna , which leads to a considerable reduction of the gyration radius of the molecule such that it can be more easily transferred into ( e.g. , mammalian ) cells @xcite .",
    "dna looping often involves large loop sizes of several thousand bp .",
    "therefore , the formation of these loops causes a non - negligible entropy loss which has to be overcome by the binding energy released at the bond formation on loop closure . in the present study",
    ", we quantify this entropy loss for such long dna loops , taking into account self - avoiding effects due to both the monomer - monomer interaction within the loop and the additional effects due to the higher order contact points ( vertices ) at the loop closure site .",
    "the resulting numbers for typical systems suggest that the entropy loss is a relevant factor in the formation of dna loops , and it gives a lower bound for the bond - forming energy required to stabilise the loop .",
    "entropy loss due to loop formation was studied for the case of disconnected loops by schellmann and flory @xcite . in their seminal paper , poland and scheraga @xcite considered coupled gaussian loops .",
    "to our knowledge the full effect of self - avoidance in the dna looping network has not been considered before .",
    "hereby , the contributions of non - trivial vertices turns out to be a relevant factor , and for multiple looping with a common locus actually become the dominating contribution .",
    "the analytical results presented here are derived from a scaling approach for general polymer networks and provide the advantage that on their basis estimates for the entropy loss in a given dna system can be computed in a straightforward manner .",
    "it should also be noted that the additional vertex effects studied herein may be crucial in the analytical treatment of the dna looping _ dynamics _ , as the higher - order self - interaction at such vertices poses an additional barrier in the loop closure process @xcite .",
    "our results for long dna with large loops complement the investigations of the bending and twisting energies in small dna plasmids @xcite . in the case of intermediate sized dna segments , both approaches may be combined .    in",
    "what follows , we calculate the scaling results for the entropy loss on looping for the three different cases : ( i ) looping in a circular dna , ( ii ) looping in a linear dna , and ( iii ) multiple looping in a circular dna . in the appendix ,",
    "the general expressions for calculating the system entropy of an arbitrary polymer network are compiled so that the entropy loss for different configurations can be calculated according to the general procedure developed below .",
    "as stated before , we consider the limit in which each segment of the looped dna , e.g. , both subloops created in the circular dna upon looping , are long in comparison to the persistence length @xmath7 of the double - stranded dna chain @xcite . in this long chain limit , we can neglect energetic effects due to bending or twisting , such that we treat the dna as a flexible self - avoiding polymer .",
    "therefore , we can employ results for the configuration number of a general polymer network , which we briefly review in the appendix .    before looping ,",
    "the free energy of the circular dna of total length @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 combines all binding enthalpies in the macromolecule and the entropy @xmath11 is determined by the number of configurations @xcite ( see the appendix ) @xmath12 of a simply connected ring polymer of length @xmath8 in units of the monomer length .",
    "the latter can be estimated by the persistence length @xmath7 of the polymer ( about 500   for double - stranded dna corresponding to 100 bp @xcite ) . in equation ( [ circ ] ) , @xmath13 is a non - universal amplitude , @xmath14 is the support dependent connectivity constant , and @xmath15 @xcite is the flory exponent .",
    "thus , @xmath16 has the form @xmath17    on looping , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to the left , the circular dna is divided into two subloops of lengths @xmath1 and @xmath0 by creation of a vertex at which four legs of the chain are bound together . for a self - avoiding chain ,",
    "the number of configurations of the resulting `` figure - eight '' shape @xcite is not simply the product of the configuration numbers of the two created loops , but has the more complicated form @xcite ( see the appendix ) @xmath18 in this expression , @xmath19 is a non - universal amplitude , @xmath20 is an universal scaling function , and @xmath21 is an universal exponent associated with the vertex with four outgoing legs .",
    "note that in the gaussian chain limit , the exponents @xmath22 vanish ; as we are going to show , the inclusion of the additional effects due to the higher order vertex formation reflected by nonzero values for @xmath22 are non - negligible .",
    "given the entropy @xmath23 of the figure eight configuration , the entropy loss suffered from creating this configuration out of the original circular dna amounts to @xmath24 .",
    "to proceed , we now evaluate the scaling function @xmath25 in some special cases , and calculate typical numbers for the required entropy loss compensation .",
    "two limiting cases can be distinguished :    * ( 1 . ) * if one of the loop sizes is much smaller than the other ( @xmath26 , say ) , the big loop of size @xmath0 will essentially behave like a free circular chain so that its contribution to @xmath27 will scale like a regular ring polymer , i.e. , like @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , we find the behaviour @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an universal amplitude , and therefore @xcite @xmath32 in this case , the free energy difference between the initial circular and the looped states becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the binding enthalpy at the loop closure site .",
    "the formation of the looping bond has to release a higher enthalpy than what is lost in entropy , i.e. , @xmath35 . collecting the different expressions ,",
    "we thus find the condition @xmath36 \\ , .\\ ] ] in this expression ( and in similar expressions below ) , the first term in the square brackets is non - universal and depends on details of the model @xcite , whereas the remaining contributions are universal ( apart from the fact that @xmath8 is measured in units of the non - universal monomer length ) .    to get an estimate for the magnitude of the entropy loss , consider the case of the @xmath4 repressor loop in e.coli . with the size of the entire dna of approximately @xmath37  kbp and the looping branch of about 2.3  kbp",
    ", the two loops correspond to @xmath38 and 23 monomers , respectively ( each monomer corresponds to a persistence length @xmath7 of 100 bp , see above ) . neglecting the non - universal first term in brackets in expression ( [ bond1 ] )",
    "@xcite , these numbers produce @xmath39 here and in the following examples we choose @xmath40 and make use of the gas constant , @xmath41 , and the conversion factor @xmath42 @xcite . expression ( [ bonden ] ) gives a considerable minimal value for the required bond energy between the two looping sites . for comparison ,",
    "the typical free energy for base pair formation in dna is 8 kcal / mol for at pairs and 13 kcal / mol for gc pairs @xcite .",
    "thus , even for the relatively small loop of 23 monomers , the required enthalpy release is non - negligible .",
    "note that the relative contribution stemming from the @xmath43 term in equation ( [ bond1 ] ) amounts to about 20% of the required enthalpy .    *",
    "* if the two created loops are of comparable size , i.e. , @xmath44 , the corresponding value of the scaling function @xmath25 is a finite number .",

    "if both loops are of size @xmath48kbp each , the required bond enthalpy would increase to @xmath49 .",

    "we have presented an analytical method to estimate the entropy loss in different scenarios of dna looping in the limit of long segments .",

    "we noted that the entropy loss is of the same order or close to the bond melting energy required for splitting an at or gc bond , i.e. , a considerable amount .",
    "moreover , it is to be expected that the vertex effect increases the characteristic bond formation times in analytical approaches which are based on the free energy .",
