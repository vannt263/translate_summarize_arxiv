    "recently , magnetism and superconductivity in the two dimensional triangular lattice with geometrical frustration have been received much attention .",
    "an interesting class of materials is the layered cobalt oxide na@xmath12coo@xmath0 , in which the coo@xmath0 plane consists of a triangular lattice of co atoms .",
    "the electron filling in the coo@xmath0 plane is controlled by changing the na content @xmath13 : the hole concentration of co @xmath14 bands is given by @xmath15 .",
    "na@xmath12coo@xmath0 with @xmath16 exhibits a weak magnetic order below 20k @xcite , where the ferromagnetic ordered coo@xmath0 layers couple antiferromagnetically with each other @xcite",
    ". an anomalous metallic state is observed for @xmath17 : the magnetic susceptibility is curie - weiss like @xcite , @xmath18-linear coefficient of the specific heat is large and increases with @xmath13 @xcite , the thermopower is unusually large @xcite . when h@xmath0o is intercalated between the coo@xmath0 layers , takada _",
    "_ @xcite have discovered the superconductivity in na@xmath1coo@xmath19h@xmath0o with @xmath20 k for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , na@xmath23coo@xmath0 exhibits remarkable two transitions at @xmath24 k and @xmath25 k @xcite : the in - plane antiferromagnetic order is realized below @xmath26 and the system becomes insulator below @xmath27 . from the nmr and the neutron measurements , yokoi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed the magnetic structure of na@xmath23coo@xmath0 , where chains of co@xmath28 with larger staggered moment and co@xmath29 with smaller moment exist alternatively within the coo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the charge ordering of the co sites into chains of co@xmath28 and co@xmath29 is closely related to the ordered pattern of na ions which form one dimensional chains below room temperature @xcite . because both of the one - dimensional na order and the in - plane antiferromagnetic order are observed only for na@xmath23coo@xmath0 , the effect of the na order on the coo@xmath0 plane is considered to play crucial role for the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the electronic state of the coo@xmath0 plane , particularly focused on the effect of the na order on the antiferromagnetic order at @xmath8 .",
    "for this purpose , we take into account of an effective one - dimensional potential on the coo@xmath0 plane due to the effect of the na order .",
    "to investigate the electronic states of the coo@xmath0 plane in the layered cobalt oxides na@xmath1coo@xmath0 , we employ the two dimensional triangular lattice @xmath2-@xmath3 model which includes 11 orbitals : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 of co and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) of o in the upper ( lower ) side of a co plane .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is a creation operator for a cobalt @xmath44 electron with wave vector @xmath45 ( site @xmath46 ) , orbital @xmath47 and spin @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is a creation operator for a oxygen @xmath50 electron with wave vector @xmath45 , site @xmath51 , orbital @xmath52 and spin @xmath48 , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , the transfer integrals @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which are written by the slater - koster parameters , together with the atomic energies @xmath56 , @xmath57 are determined so as to fit the tight - binding energy bands to the lda bands for na@xmath23coo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "effects of the coulomb interaction at a co site : the intra- and inter - orbital direct terms @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the exchange coupling @xmath6 and the pair - transfer @xmath7 @xcite . here and hereafter",
    ", we assume the rotational invariance yielding the relations : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we also consider the effect of the one - dimensional na order , in which na ions form one dimensional chains , by taking into account of an effective one - dimensional potential on the coo@xmath0 plane : @xmath60 with the effective potential @xmath9 due to the na order .",
    "hereafter , in order to consider the both na order and the antiferromagnetic order , we use an extended unit cell including four co atoms and eight o atoms , together with the magnetic brillouin zone which is @xmath61 of the original brillouin zone .",
    "now we discuss the antiferromagnetism in the case with @xmath8 within the hartree - fock approximation @xcite . in this study",
    ", we assume that the order parameters are diagonal with respect to the orbital @xmath47 and the spin @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig-1 ] shows the sublattice magnetization @xmath47 as a function of the temperature @xmath18 for various values of the effective potential @xmath9 at @xmath62 ev and @xmath63 ev . in the absence of the na order @xmath64 , no antiferromagnetic transition is observed for small values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 as the fermi surface nesting with wave vector @xmath65 corresponding to the in - plane antiferromagnetism is weak due to the strong frustration effect in the triangular lattice . with increasing @xmath9 , the antiferromagnetic transition temperature together with the sublattice magnetization increases .",
    "due to the effect of the one - dimensional potential , the band structure becomes quasi one - dimensional and the fermi surface nesting is enhanced .",
    "then , the antiferromagnetic ordered state appears in the presence of the na order . in this case",
    ", the sublattice magnetization exclusively comes from the co sites on the na ordered line .",
    "we note that the antiferromagnetic state is realized in the both cases with and without the small fermi surface pockets predicted by the lda calculation @xcite but not observed in the arpes experiments @xcite .    in figure [ fig-2 ] ,",
    "we plot the fermi surfaces and the band structure in the antiferromagnetic state at @xmath66 for @xmath62 ev , @xmath63 ev with @xmath67 ev . in this antiferromagnetic state ,",
    "the system is metallic where the electron like fermi surfaces around k points together with the hole like fermi surfaces around m points yield a large value of the density of states @xmath10 at the fermi level . on the other hand ,",
    "when we increase the coulomb interactions as @xmath68 ev and @xmath69 for the fixed value of @xmath67 ev , the ground state becomes the semimetallic antiferromagnetic state with tiny fermi surface pockets around k points yielding a tiny @xmath10 as shown in figure [ fig-3 ] .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath68 ev and @xmath69 with larger values of @xmath70 ev , the ground state becomes the insulating antiferromagnetic state with a finite energy gap as shown in figure [ fig-4 ] . in this case , the sublattice magnetization from the co sites out of the na ordered line is larger than that from the co sites on the na ordered line , which is consistent with the magnetic structure proposed by yokoi _",
    "we investigated the electronic state in the coo@xmath0 plane of the layered cobalt oxides na@xmath1coo@xmath0 by using the 11 band @xmath2-@xmath3 model on a two - dimensional triangular lattice within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "what we found are : the effect of the one - dimensional potential @xmath9 due to the na order enhances the fermi surface nesting resulting in the antiferromagnetic ordered state for @xmath8 .",
    "there are three types of the antiferromagnetic states : ( 1 ) the metallic one for small values of @xmath4 and @xmath9 , ( 2 ) the semimetallic one for large @xmath4 with small @xmath9 and ( 3 ) the insulating one for large values of @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "although the insulating antiferromagnetic state seems to be consistent with the experimentally observed ordered state below @xmath27 , we need further investigation especially on the mechanism of the metal - insulator transition at @xmath27 .",
