    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with compton - thick ( ct ) nuclear obscuration ( @xmath18 @xmath1 1.5@xmath310@xmath22 @xmath20 ) are a crucial piece in the quest for a complete census of the agn population . while _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have revealed a large population of agn up to @xmath6@xmath105 and demonstrated unambiguously the dominance of supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) accretion in the obscured phase @xcite , the necessity of having a high snr x - ray spectrum including detection above and below rest - frame energies of 10 kev , largely limits the detectability to reveal the presence of ct agn in deep surveys @xcite .",
    "however , there are several compelling reasons to suspect an abundant distant ct agn population : ( 1 ) in the local universe the ct agn comprise roughly 50% of the optically - selected agn sample @xcite ; given the dusty high-@xmath6 universe , the distant ct agn may be more abundant .",
    "( 2 ) cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) population models invoke luminosity functions of agn with different hi columns to fit the x - ray survey data @xcite , which requires a large number of ct agn to re - produce the cxb spectrum at its peak ( 20 - 30 kev ) ; this general conclusion is largely independent of detailed assumptions in the model . ( 3 ) the multi - wavelength techniques that combine the x - ray data with optical / ir photometry offer powerful ways to identify ct candidates , and indicate an increasing spatial density of ct agn with redshift @xcite .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    ", we presented a joint population model of x - ray and infrared backgrounds that fits the survey data in the 0.5 - 60 kev and 24 - 1200 @xmath15 m bands , with the goal of studying the cosmic evolution of agn and dusty starbursts .",
    "we discuss here the ct agn abundance derived from this model .",
    "in contrast to cxb models that only fit x - ray data primarily at energies below 10 kev , our approach is fundamentally different .",
    "cxb models usually use 0.1 - 10 kev data to fit the compton - thin agn counts , extrapolate the result to 20 - 30 kev and then subtract this from the cxb spectrum to derive the abundance of ct agn .",
    "our model constrains the compton - thin agn from 0.5 - 10 kev data and starburst galaxies from far - ir data , and compares the 24 @xmath15 m from these populations to the ir background and known distributions of 24 @xmath15m - detected sources .",
    "the residual of the 24@xmath15 m emission after subtracting the contributions from compton - thin and starburst galaxies is assumed to be from compton - thick agn . as a result ,",
    "our model uses more observational information to constrain the ct agn fractions as a function of luminosity and redshift , including both number counts and redshift distributions at 24 @xmath15 m . in our model",
    ", we allow the redshift evolution of the ct agn to be a free parameter , while the cxb models typically assume no evolution , fixed evolution or an evolution as the same as the compton - thin agn .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of individual sources is crucial to any population model , but our joint model and the cxb models depend on different parts of the sed .",
    "the cxb model is sensitive to the x - ray sed above 10 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while ours relies on the 24@xmath15m/2 - 10kev ratio of the smbh sed but also the star - forming ir sed .",
    "as a result , we ran four variants of the model to incorporate the sed uncertainties , including the reference one , the one with x - ray to ir ratio of the smbh sed 3-@xmath23 ( 0.2 dex ) above the average ratio , the one with x - ray to ir ratio of the smbh sed 3-@xmath23 ( 0.2 dex ) below the average ratio and the one assuming strong redshift evolution in the star - forming sed ( for details , see paper i ) .",
    "overall , our model provides a new way to constrain the ct agn abundance using substantially more information from more diverse deep survey data .",
    "paper i presented the detailed model construction and three basic outputs including the total ir luminosity function , the smbh energy fraction in the ir band and hi column density distributions as a function of x - ray luminosity and redshift .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the predicted ct agn abundance and compare it to a large collection of empirical constraints . in   [ section_evl_ctagn ] , we show the spatial number density of ct agn .",
    "we present the type-2 and ct agn fraction as a function of x - ray fluxes in   [ section_agn_fraction ] .",

    "symbols with the same color are the empirical estimates from the literature above the same limits . among different variants of our model ,",
    "as reflected by the vertical width of the filled area in the figure , the predicted number density varies from a factor of 2 for low luminosity objects ( @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg / s ) up to a factor of 5 for luminous ones ( @xmath1 10@xmath9 erg / s ) . for ct agn with intrinsic @xmath24",

    "the local densities as measured by @xcite and @xcite are consistent with our predictions .",
    "the estimate at @xmath6@xmath100.7 by @xcite is only a factor of 2 lower than our prediction .",

    "erg / s , the comoving density of the ct agn shows a rapid rise until @xmath6@xmath102 and almost a flat trend up to @xmath6=3 . the model s prediction is more or less consistent with observations @xcite except for one data point around @xmath6@xmath300.9 but within the uncertainty @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the x - ray spectra of sources in the 1ms cdf - s and identified 14 ct agns , possibly missing the x - ray - undetected ct agns . at @xmath31 @xmath1 10@xmath9",
    "erg / s , the ct agn show a rapid evolution in the model , with two orders of magnitude increase in density from @xmath6=0 up to @xmath6=3 .",
    "model prediction around @xmath6@xmath102 is lower than the estimate by @xcite .",
    "although only x - ray detected sources are accounted for this measurement @xcite , the low number of objects caution a large uncertainty associated with the measurement .",
    "the predicted ct agn number density of our model is generally similar to predictions by the cxb model of @xcite ( dotted lines in figure  [ evl_ctagn ] ) but ours peaks at higher redshift .",
    "the model of @xcite assumed all x - ray sources detected at 0.5 - 2 and 2 - 10 kev to be compton - thin and derived their distributions as a function of redshift , luminosity and hi columns . after subtracting the contribution of these compton - thin sources from the cxb spectrum ,",
    "the residual is not zero , thus implying the existence of ct agn . by assuming the same redshift evolution for ct agn as for obscured compton - thin agn , the amount of ct agn is derived by matching to the cxb spectrum . at a given redshift and limiting x - ray luminosity",
    ", their result does not deviate from ours significantly .",
    "a significant difference however between the two models is that they predict a lower redshift for the peak of the ct agn number density . for @xmath32 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg / s ,",
    "our peak redshift is @xmath6@xmath101 - 1.5 compared to theirs around @xmath330.7 .",
    "a difference of @xmath34@xmath6=0.5 - 1 in the peak redshift is also found for the number density of ct agn at @xmath27 @xmath1 10@xmath35 erg / s .",
    "the cxb model of @xcite ( solid lines in figure  [ evl_ctagn ] ) predicts lower ct agn number densities than ours . at @xmath31 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg / s ,",
    "our predicted ct density is 5 - 10 times higher than theirs across the whole redshift range . at higher luminosities ( @xmath1 10@xmath35 erg / s ) ,",
    "their predictions are similar to ours up to their turn - over redshift but lower by 5 - 10 at higher redshifts as our predicted density rises faster .",
    "this is not surprising , since treister et al hold the ct fraction in obscured agn constant at the local value seen in the integral and swift data , allowing for no redshift evolution .",
    "in contrast , our model requires more ct agn at higher redshifts to satisfy the various sets of observations ( see paper i ) .",
    "as shown in the next section , our model has no problem in reproducing the ct agn fraction as observed by integral and swift .    in the cxb model of @xcite",
    "( dotted - dashed lines in figure  [ evl_ctagn ] ) , low luminosity ct agn ( @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg / s and @xmath1 10@xmath7 erg / s ) have comparable number densities to those predicted from our models at low redshift , but are noticeably lower than ours at high @xmath6 .",
    "the opposite seems to be the case for the high luminosity ct agn , where two models make similar predictions at high redshift , but differ at low redshift where the @xcite models predict more ct agn than do our models .",
    "these differences reflect the weaker dependence of their models on luminosity and redshift @xcite .",
    "figure  [ obsfrac_flux ] plots the fractions of agn that are type-2 ( @xmath18 @xmath1 10@xmath36 @xmath20 ) and compton thick at different 2 - 10 kev and 20 - 40 kev fluxes .",
    "the two fractions show similar behaviors , i.e. , a flat trend at bright fluxes along with a rapid rise toward fainter ends .",
    "constant type-2 fractions of 30@xmath3710% and 35@xmath3710% are found at 2 - 10 kev and 20 - 40 kev above fluxes of 10@xmath38 erg / s/@xmath13 , respectively , while the ct agn fractions remain around 3@xmath373% and 4@xmath373% at 2 - 10 kev and 20 - 40 kev above fluxes of 10@xmath12 erg / s/@xmath20 , respectively . in paper",
    "i , our model predicts a rapid redshift evolution of the type-2 and ct agn fraction at given intrinsic x - ray luminosities , making the two fractions increase with decreasing fluxes , which combined with further obscuration to ct / type-2 objects results in a flat trend at bright fluxes but a rapid rise toward lower fluxes .",
    "as shown in the figure , the predicted type-2 agn fractions are consistent with empirical constraints as compiled in the work of @xcite including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all these studies identified the type-2 in x - ray flux limited samples through x - ray spectral analysis . for the ct agn fraction as a function of the 2 - 10 kev flux , we compared our predictions to empirical estimates based on studies of three x - ray flux limited samples @xcite that are constructed from chandra 1 ms , 2ms and 4ms survey data , respectively .",
    "the first two identified ct agn through x - ray spectral analysis and derived ct fractions of 5% down to @xmath39=10@xmath12 erg / s/@xmath13 , consistent with the predictions of our model .",
    "the majority of these objects are ct agn whose transmitted light dominates over the reflected radiation in x - ray .",
    "@xcite carried out x - ray spectral analysis of 449 x - ray sources down to a flux 10 times lower ( @xmath40=10@xmath41 erg / s/@xmath13 ) , with average photon counts 3 - 5 times smaller than the other two studies .",
    "after corrections for these two effects , they argued for 20@xmath372% ct agn fraction , lower than our model s prediction but within the uncertainty . at 20 - 40",
    "kev , our result is consistent with the ct fraction as identified in swift / integral data @xcite in which all ct agn are identified as transmission sources .",
    "the recently launched nustar mission should offer strong constraints on the ct agn fraction down to 10@xmath42 erg / s/@xmath13 .    as already discussed in the previous section ,",
    "our model predicts roughly the same ct agn abundance as the model of @xcite but our predicted ct agn number density peaks at higher redshift .",
    "this is also reflected in figure  [ obsfrac_flux ] ( right panel ) where our ct fraction is lower than theirs above 10@xmath12 erg / s/@xmath13 but exceeds theirs at fainter flux levels .",
    "compared to the model of @xcite , our model predicts more abundant ct agn at high @xmath6 , resulting in a similar ct fraction above 10@xmath12 erg / s/@xmath13 but a significantly higher fraction in our model at fainter fluxes .",
    "an smbh grows through accretion , and the accretion disk is responsible for the optical through x - ray emission . by introducing the radiative efficiency @xmath43 ,",
    "the observed smbh luminosity and accretion rate are related by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the luminosity integrated from the optical to the x - ray ( 1 @xmath15 m to 200 kev ) , @xmath43 is the mass to energy conversion rate , @xmath46 is smbh mass accretion rate and @xmath47 is the speed of light . as constructed in paper i , our quasar sed invokes the luminosity - dependent optical to x - ray ratio , and thus the correction from 2 - 10 kev to the luminosity from 1 @xmath15 m to 200 kev is luminosity dependent with an average value around a factor of 30 .",
    "figure  [ smbh_accretion ] shows the comoving smbh accretion rate ( upper panel ) and cumulative accreted smbh mass above a given redshift ( lower panel ) .",
    "our predicted accretion rates seem to match those presented in @xcite up to @xmath6=2 , but exceed theirs at higher redshifts , while the discrepancy in the cumulative accreted smbh mass across the redshift is caused by that above @xmath6=2 .",
    "we believe the discrepancy to be related to the large uncertainties in deriving the obscured agn lfs at these redshifts . the derived local smbh mass density is ( 5.8@xmath371.0)@xmath310@xmath48 m@xmath49 mpc@xmath5 given @xmath43=0.1 .",
    "this number is quite consistent with those derived from local bulge mass functions through the bulge / bh - mass relationship , ( 2.9@xmath370.5)@xmath310@xmath48 m@xmath49 mpc@xmath5 @xcite , ( 4.2@xmath371.1)@xmath310@xmath48 m@xmath49 mpc@xmath5 @xcite and @xmath50@xmath310@xmath48 m@xmath49 mpc@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our model further predicts that only 33% of local smbh mass is accreted in the type-1 phase while the ct accretion contributes as much as 38% to the local smbh mass density .",
    "figure  [ cosmic_xray_light ] shows our prediction for the cxb spectrum at 1 - 200 kev as compared to observations .",
    "our model predicts a peak around 20 kev .",
    "below 20 kev , our prediction matches the results of rxte / pca @xcite and asca / sis @xcite , but is about 20% lower than those of swift / xrt @xcite and integral / jem - x @xcite . at 20 - 100 kev ,",
    "the model is systematically lower by 20 - 30% than the observations @xcite .",
    "we do not know exactly what causes the discrepancy but noticed that the model can not re - produce the local 15 - 55 kev counts of @xcite and the cxb spectrum above 20 kev at the same time . if the model fits the @xcite counts , it under - produces the cxb spectrum above 20 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "if the model is forced to fit the cxb spectrum , it would over - predict counts of @xcite . as noted in @xcite , previous cxb models have a similar problem , including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where they fit the cxb spectrum well but over - predict local 15 - 55 kev counts . a key observational input for the cxb models to fit both @xcite counts and cxb spectrum above 20 kev is the rest - frame sed at energies above 20 kev which is still not well constrained given limited observations .",
    "but certainly we can not exclude the possibility that our model has limitations in reproducing the cxb spectrum above 20 kev as it fits so many data points over a very large range of the frequency ( x - ray and ir / submm ) to minimize @xmath51 .",
    "as shown in the figure , type-1 agn dominate the cxb below 5 kev , above which the type-2 are responsible for the majority of cxb emission .",
    "the ct agn contribution rises quickly from low energy and peaks around @xmath1025% at 20 kev .",
    "our model predicts an abundant ct agn population especially at high-@xmath6 . by comparing figure  [ evl_ctagn ] to the type-1",
    "unobscured agn number density as measured by @xcite , our predicted ct agn density is 3 - 5 times higher at @xmath52 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg / s . at @xmath53 @xmath1 10@xmath8 erg / s , the predicted ct agn density is still comparable to their type-1 agn around @xmath33 2 .",
    "as shown in paper i , our model predicts an increasing ct agn fraction with redshift , resulting in a larger ct agn population at high-@xmath6 as compared to the predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the large ct agn fraction around @xmath6 @xmath10 2 may be consistent with observational evidence for high gas fractions and associated high sfrs of @xmath6@xmath54 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the high velocity dispersion of @xmath6 @xmath54 2 gas disks implies a large vertical height @xcite , as might result from continuous stirring by on - going star formation @xcite .",
    "if such behavior persists as gas is transported down to the central 1 - 10 pc scale around the nuclear bh @xcite , the dusty torus of high-@xmath6 agn might have a larger vertical extent and subsequently cover a larger solid angle , resulting in a larger ct agn fraction at high - z @xcite . in spite of their abundance in our model ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ obsfrac_flux ] , ct agn only dominate at @xmath11 @xmath21 10@xmath12 erg / s/@xmath13 , where little data is available from current x - ray missions to reliably identify these objects . another possibility to explain the increasing obscured fraction is related to redshift evolution of major mergers as shown by @xcite in which abundant dust and gas brought in by mergers obscure the nucleus before they are disrupted by radiation pressure to reveal a type-1 , unobscured quasar phase .",
    "the featureless mid - ir emission from the dusty torus of agn has been a powerful way to infer the intrinsic accretion luminosity .",
    "especially when appearing along with weak or no x - ray emission , this continuum offers a strong indicator of ct hi columns @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ew_ct_lx_red ] gives the predicted median and 20 - 80% probability range of 6.2 @xmath15 m aromatic feature ew of ct agn in three intrinsic x - ray luminosity ranges , 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath7 erg / s , 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 erg / s and @xmath1 10@xmath8 erg / s .",
    "note that the ew of star - forming templates in our model has a value of 0.6 @xmath15 m , so smaller values indicate the presence of the contribution from the dusty torus . in paper",
    "i , we compared our model s predictions on the ew distributions to observations for two spitzer legacy programs ( goals & 5muses ) and found a general consistency .",
    "figure  [ ew_ct_lx_red ] also gives the observed ew of individual ct agn drawn from the literature , where the local sample is from @xcite , and high - z sample is from @xcite .",
    "although a fair comparison between the model and observation is impossible for such a sample , the data are within the model predicted range .",

    "we define objects with ew@xmath55 @xmath21 0.4 @xmath15 m as those with detectable hot dust emission from agn , because observations confirm a small scatter in the star - forming 6.2 @xmath15 m ews , with the median of 0.6 @xmath15 m and 3-@xmath23 dispersions about 0.2 - 0.25 @xmath15 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
