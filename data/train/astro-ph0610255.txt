    "nothing can be said at this stage about the redshift of source # 7 , however . here",
    ", we assume that it is a member of the cluster of galaxies at @xmath21=0.72 @xcite .",
    "our two fors2 observing runs were arranged such that they would allow us to search for a fading ( afterglow ) as well as for a rising ( supernova ) component following grb 050813 , supposing @xmath21=0.72 .",
    "initially we searched for a transient isolated point source in the original 10 arcsec xrt error circle , but we did not find one .",
    "the fact that the sources # 2 , # 5 and # 6 ( fig .",
    "[ field ] ; table  [ tab2 ] ) are not detected in the combined image of the first vlt / fors2 observing run might be due to the presence of the moon , causing an enhanced sky background level . during the second fors2 run the sky background was much lower and the seeing even better than during the first observing run .",
    "we conclude that any well - isolated afterglow or supernova in this field was fainter than the magnitude limits at the time of the two fors2 observing runs , @xmath0=25.1 and 25.5 , respectively .      based on our deep fors2 observing runs",
    ", we searched for a potential fading afterglow superimposed on the brightest extended sources ( galaxies ) in the field ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "no evidence for variability due to an underlying transient source was found .",
    "@xcite identified object c and e as elliptical galaxies ( fig .  [ field ] ) , with c being the most likely host candidate based on its location relative to their revised elliptical error circle . in our images source e appears to have an irregular halo which does not support its classification as an elliptical .",
    "image subtraction did not reveal any transient source superimposed on this galaxy .    in order to obtain an upper limit on a possible detection of an afterglow ( or a sn ) in the first ( second ) epoch fors2 image superimposed source e , we artificially added point sources of different magnitudes to e and then performed an aperture photometry .",
    "these point sources were selected from the second epoch image .",
    "all pixels of the second epoch image were then set to zero except the pixels of the selected point source of known magnitude and the resulting image was then shifted and added to the first epoch image .",
    "this analysis showed that we would have been able to detect ( at 3 @xmath29 ) a fading afterglow superimposed on this galaxy if its @xmath0-band magnitude had been 23.5 at the time of the first fors2 observation .",
    "one of the main observational characteristics of a short burst should be the absence of a sn component in the late - time afterglow @xcite , as the merger is not expected to result in the kind of radioactivity - powered optical display typical for thermonuclear ( type ia ) and core - collapse ( types ii and ib / c ) supernovae .",
    "however , mergers may have sub - relativistic explosions with low amount of ejected mass @xcite , but they should have a small luminosity . in agreement with these expectations ,",
    "strong upper limits could be set so far on any potential sn component accompanying short bursts ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the constraints we can place on a rising sn component for grb  050813 are less severe , given the potentially relatively high redshift of this burst .",
    "for the cosmological parameters employed here , sn 1998bw @xcite redshifted to @xmath21=0.72 would have magnitudes of @xmath0=24.7 and @xmath0=23.9 during our first and second vlt / fors observing run , respectively , after taking into account a galactic reddening of @xmath30=0.056 mag @xcite in the direction of grb 050813 . at that brightness level",
    "we would have detected the sn if not superimposed on a much brighter host or strongly extinguished by dust .",
    "more precisely , we conclude that at the time of our second fors2 observation any supernova following grb 050813 was at least about 1.5 mag less luminous than sn 1998bw .",
    "while constraints placed on any sn component underlying the afterglow of e.g. grb 050509b @xcite and grb 050709 @xcite are much stronger , this makes a potential sn component following grb 050813 already fainter than any of the 11 grb - sne of long bursts known to date ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 6 ) .    on the other hand , we would have been able to detect ( at 3 @xmath29 ) a rising sn component superimposed on the bright galaxy e ( fig .",
    "[ field ] ) only if its @xmath0-band magnitude had been 23.5 at the time of the second fors2 observation .",
    "in other words , a sn 1998bw - like component would be missed in this case .",
    "the same holds for a typical type ia supernova @xcite , which would have had @xmath0=26.9 and @xmath0=25.4 at the time of our first and second fors2 observing run , respectively .",
    "short bursts , by phenomenological classification introduced by @xcite , are bursts whose @xmath4 duration measured with _",
    "batse _ was less than 2 sec . even though it has already been known in the 1990s that @xmath4 is a function of energy ( and of detector properties ) , this definition , because of its simplicity , has been widely used even in the _ hete-2 _ and in the _ swift _ era . in principle , having now much more observational data at hand for individual bursts than in the _ batse _ era , this phenomenological definition / classification scheme calls for a more accurate , namely physical classification scheme .",
    "it is clear that the classification of individual bursts with respect to the nature of their progenitor is difficult .",
    "recent investigations tackle this problem and have led to the suggestion of much more then just one criterium in order to classify a grb @xcite . as long as no consensus has been reached in the literature what the ultimate criteria are for a burst",
    "to be classified as being due to a merger event , in several cases only arguments can be provided that favor one scenario for the other ( merger vs. collapse ) .",
    "the detection or non - detection of a sn signal plays a key role in this approach but has come into question recently ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this leaves the nature of the host galaxy as the strongest argument to detect a grb due to a merger event , namely if the host is an elliptical galaxy .",
    "but the potentially broad range in merger times and hence distances of the merger events from their host galaxies ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might also call into question the application of this criterium .",
    "grb 050813 belongs to those bursts that demonstrate all these problems in detail .",
    "one of the main goals of our observing runs was the localization of the afterglow and hence the identification of the grb host galaxy .",
    "basically , the host can not be identified with certainty and we have to consider other arguments that favor or disfavor any galaxy visible on the deep fors2 @xmath0-band images of the xrt error circle as the potential host . grb 050813 then joins the increasing list of short bursts with no detected optical afterglow , starting with grb 050509b @xcite . using the upper limits on the afterglow of grb 050813 ( table 1 ) we can follow @xcite and place the properties of this afterglow in the context of other known grb afterglows ( fig .",
    "[ iclks ] ) .",
    "the long burst afterglows shown in fig .",
    "[ iclks ] by solid lines are those from the `` golden sample '' of @xcite , i.e. , those that have sufficient @xmath0-band data . in addition , we analyzed the available afterglow data on the short bursts grb 050709 @xcite , grb 050724 @xcite , grb 051221a @xcite and grb 060121 @xcite in an analogous way and also included them in fig .",
    "[ iclks ] ( see the appendix b for details ) .",
    "as can be seen , short burst optical afterglows are intrinsically very faint , with the afterglows of grb 050724 and grb 051221a being about 3 magnitudes fainter than any long burst afterglow in the sample , and grb 050709 being 4 magnitudes fainter at one day after the burst and assuming @xmath16 ( in agreement with the predictions for short burst afterglows ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are also significantly fainter than intrinsically faint afterglows of some long grbs , such as grb 021211 .",
    "only the afterglow of grb 060121 is comparable with the typical afterglows of long grbs .",
    "the upper limits on the optical afterglow of grb 050813 show that its luminosity was also far below typical luminosities of ( extinction - corrected ) afterglows of long bursts . on the other hand",
    ", it matches the luminosity region occupied so far by afterglows of the short bursts ( with grb 060121 being the only exception ) .",
    "figure  [ field ] shows that there are only two sources in the xrt error ellipse @xcite , while there are at least three additional sources in the refined error circle @xcite .",
    "the former might favor a burst related to the very faint sources # 6 and # 7 ( source # 6 appears point - like in our images ) but it does not even exclude an event in the outer halo of source c , an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.719 @xcite . the minimum distance between the border of the error ellipse and",
    "the center of this galaxy is 3.2 arcsec , corresponding to a projected distance of 23 kpc .",
    "this is less than the projected distance of the error circle of grb 050509b from the center of its suspected host , an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of @xmath21=0.225 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the minimum angular distance between source e and the border of the error ellipse is 7.1 arcsec , corresponding to a projected distance of 51 kpc .",
    "even this is within the range predicted by recent models of merging compact objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the error circle determined by @xcite is much larger , and thus allows not only source c but also galaxy e at @xmath31 @xcite to be the potential host of grb 050813 .",
    "this galaxy was classified by @xcite as an elliptical galaxy , while our images show morphology that point either to a spiral or to an irregular galaxy .",
    "the nature of the fifth , point - like source in the refined error circle , # 4 , remains undetermined .",
    "while this paper was submitted , a new revised xrt error circle was reported by @xcite .",
    "this revised error circle is 3.8 arcsec in radius and centered close to a faint edge - on galaxy .",
    "this galaxy ( source # 7 , see fig .  [ field ] )",
    "was only marginally detected during the first fors observations .",
    "a comparison with the second fors observations six days later does not provide convincing evidence for a photometric variability due to an underlying point source .    to summarize , our optical data do not reveal either an afterglow nor a sn component .",
    "if grb 050813 was occurring in a cluster of galaxies at a redshift of @xmath21=0.72 , as it might be indicated by the surrounding galaxy population , then its projected distance from its potential host galaxy could have been of the order of less than 4 to some dozen kpc , depending on the chosen potential host galaxy .",
    "the non - detection of the afterglow is well in accord with the faintness of optical afterglows following short bursts ( fig .",
    "[ iclks ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the burster would had been at @xmath21=1.8 @xcite , no sn  1998bw - like component would have been detectable in our images and any afterglow component would have been correspondingly fainter than in the former case ( fig .",
