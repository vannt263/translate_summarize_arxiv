    "molecular motors are nanosized biological machines involved in essential cellular processes such as intracellular transport , protein synthesis and transcription and repair of dna @xcite . over the last two decades molecular machines have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally in order to reveal the organizing principles behind their ability to efficiently solve specialized tasks in complex environments ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , there has been a rapid development of various artificial nanomotors with the aim of mimicking the performance of biological machines @xcite . in a typical setup",
    "the nanomachine translates along a track in an isothermal environment driven by chemical reactions , external forces , electric or magnetic fields . while an external modification of the system parameters is often needed to operate the system , the goal is to design autonomous machines that operate under steady - state conditions in anology to their biological counterparts @xcite .",
    "since motor proteins often function collectively in the cell , a detailed understanding of molecular motor function requires considering the role of cooperative effects mediated through , e.g. , excluded volume interactions or mechanical constraints imposed by motors being coupled to the same cargo @xcite .",
    "likewise , man - made molecular motors must operate in unison in order to achieve the desired efficiency and fidelity @xcite .",
    "the collective motion of molecular motors on an underlying substrate is frequently referred to as ( molecular ) motor traffic .",
    "the efficiency of isothermal machines defined as the delivered power output divided by the consumed power input is constrained by the thermodynamic bound 1 . however , achieving maximum efficiency comes at the expense of quasistatic operation and , hence , zero power output .",
    "a practically more relevant quantity to consider is thus the efficiency at maximum power ( emp ) which offers a quantitative measure of the power - efficiency trade - off in nanomotors .",
    "both the universal and system - specific features of the emp for single isothermal machines have been addressed in @xcite , while the issue of the emp for cooperative systems has received far less attention to date .",
    "motor traffic is a widely studied phenomenon , which is typically modelled using exclusion processes on discrete lattices @xcite .",
    "even so , most of these works are concerned with collective dynamics rather than thermodynamics , and they often deal with specific molecular motor proteins @xcite .",
    "our previous papers @xcite in which we studied the effect of exclusion interactions on the thermodynamic aspects of intracellular traffic , pose an exception . in these works we found that the emp is enhanced , as compared to the non - interacting case , due to an interaction - induced change in the characteristic response of the system to external loads . yet",
    ", this result was obtained in the specific context of kinesin motors moving on a single filament .",
    "an interesting question is thus whether a similar phenomenon can be observed in a more general setting .",
    "for example , in the context of biological machines it is relevant to consider motor traffic on networks as , e.g. , the molecular motors involved in intracellular transport move on the cytoskeleton that consists of many interlinked filamentous tracks rather than a single filament @xcite .    in order to address the aforementioned question",
    "we investigate the thermodynamics of motor traffic on bethe networks subject to hard - core exclusion for two different models of autonomous nanomachines that perform work against a constant load .",
    "the first model studied in this paper represents machines where the configurational space of the motor can be projected into an effective one - dimensional , periodic potential energy landscape with a single saddle point or activation barrier , like the potentials studied in @xcite . for high activation barriers ,",
    "the resulting dynamics is well - described by a network model with a single state corresponding to the minima of the energy landscape .",
    "model i thus describes one - state motors and is solved in sec . [ sec : modeli ] by adopting the mean - field approach recently introduced in @xcite for studying exclusion processes on general networks . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modeliemp ] we optimize the power output with respect to the applied load and find that the corresponding emp is enhanced , as compared to non - interacting motors with the same parameters , for a wide range of input energies , motor densities and network connectivities due to a phase transition from a heterogeneous to a homogeneous phase as the load is increased .",
    "since the emp enhancement follows from the effect of load - controlled traffic jams on the resultant motor velocity , it entails a decrease in the maximum power output , as compared to the non - interacting case .",
    "we introduce a quantitative measure in order to characterize the trade - off between emp and the maximum power output when the machines operate at maximum emp enhancement for fixed network parameters .",
    "using this measure we find that the trade - off is beneficial in a certain region of the network parameter space .",
    "generally , the configurational space of the motor is more complex than the situation considered in model i. for example , the state space of biological machines contains several intermediate states corresponding to conformational changes of the motor protein and several mechanochemical thermodynamic cycles accounting for multiple dissipative pathways @xcite . indeed , it has been shown in several works that it is important to include the existence of internal motor states into the description of cooperative effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for loosely - coupled motors , i.e. motors with several thermodynamic cycles , dissipative effects generally lead to a lower efficiency and emp than for tightly - coupled motors with a single thermodynamic cycle , which the one - state model i is a particular example of @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelii ] we therefore extend the formalism of @xcite to study motors with two states and several thermodynamic cycles ( model ii ) in order to explore the robustness of the emp enhancement to changes in the internal motor dynamics .",
    "we find for model ii that mutual interactions lead to a boost in the emp qualitatively similar to the one found for model i whenever the purely dissipative transitions are only moderately strong , which is indeed the case for a broad range of single motor parameters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : modeliiemp ] ) .",
    "likewise , in this operational regime the emp enhancement is found to be greater than the corresponding loss in the maximum output power according to the measure described earlier .",
    "we start out by considering the case of single - state machines moving on periodic bethe networks comprised of directed segments connected by vertices @xcite .",
    "the motors act as poissonian walkers and perform forward ( backward ) jumps with rate @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) between neighbouring sites on the segment , or between a vertex site and a segment , subject to hard - core exclusion ; if a motor attempts a jump to a position already occupied by another motor , the step will be rejected .",
    "the dynamics of one - state machines interacting though excluded volume effects is thus equivalent to the paradigmatic model for non - equilibrium transport known as the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic consistency requires that the stepping rates satisfy the local detalied balance ( ldb ) relation @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the input work consumed by the motor and the output work delivered by the motor when completing a step in the forward direction . here and in the following , we measure energies in units of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is boltzmanns constant , and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "the commonly used parametrisation of the jumping rates based on kramers theory reads @xcite @xmath8 and is thus consistent with the ldb condition . here",
    ", @xmath9 is a microscopic jumping rate , and @xmath10 denotes the so - called load factor related to the position of the activation barrier along the reaction coordinate .",
    "the solution for model i builds upon the transport properties of the asep on a single open segment , which we therefore briefly revisit here @xcite . in this case",
    "the particles are injected ( removed ) with rates @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) at the left end of the segment , and with rates @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) at the right end .",
    "the requirement of current conservation at the left and right segment boundaries allows to define the left and right reservoir densities , @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] , respectively , in terms of the injection and removal rates , where @xmath17=\\frac{p - q+x+y-\\sqrt{(p - q+x+y)^2 - 4(p - q)x}}{2(p - q)}.\\ ] ] the exact phase diagram for the steady - state probability current @xmath18 in the thermodynamic limit projected onto @xmath19 and @xmath20 consists of three regions termed low - density ( ld ) , high - density ( hd ) , and maximal current ( mc ) phase , respectively .",
    "the current - density relation is given by @xmath21 , where the phase - dependent bulk density @xmath22 and the phase boundaries are as follows : @xmath23    in the case of bethe networks , all the vertices have identical connectivity and must thus have equal densities which we denote by @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , all the segment densities must be identical and equal to the total density @xmath25 of motors on the network . for infinitely long homogeneous segments , the vertex and segment occupancies are related through eq . and the mean - field entry and exit rates for a segment @xcite , @xmath26&=p\\rho_v / c ,     & \\qquad \\beta[\\rho_v]&=p(1-\\rho_v ) , \\\\",

    "it is worth noting that the entry rates @xmath11 and @xmath13 are reduced by a factor of @xmath27 since the particles leaving a vertex enter only one of the @xmath27 available outgoing segments .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    " that the system undergoes a phase transition from the ld to the hd phase for @xmath28,\\gamma[{\\bar{\\rho}_v}])=1-{\\varrho_{\\text{hd}}}(\\beta[{\\bar{\\rho}_v}],\\delta[{\\bar{\\rho}_v}])\\ ] ] corresponding to the threshold vertex density @xmath29 .",
    "all the segments are thus in the ld phase for @xmath30 , where the delimiting segment density @xmath31 $ ] is @xmath32 while the high - density conditions apply for @xmath33=1-{\\bar{\\rho}}_l$ ] . for intermediate densities",
    "a heterogeneous shock phase ( sp ) arises where a ld zone with density @xmath34 and a hd zone with density @xmath35 coexist on the segment separated by a diffusing domain wall @xcite . in this phase",
    "the network responds to increasing densities by growing the hd regions at the expense of the ld regions .",
    "the resulting motor current sustained by the network is , however , unaffected since the ld and hd zones have complementary densities @xmath36 , and thus carry the same current . the current - density profile @xmath37 for model i given by @xcite @xmath38 therefore exhibits a plateau in the shock phase .",
    "we note that since @xmath39 are functions of the jumping rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath37 depends on all the motor parameters through eq . .    in fig",
    "[ fig : rhoji ] we show the current - density relation for different values of the input work @xmath3 , output work @xmath4 and connectivity @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to note that the current plateau becomes broader when @xmath27 and @xmath3 are increased , while it shrinks for increasing @xmath4 .",
    "hence , for fixed @xmath27 , @xmath25 and @xmath3 it is possible to observe a transition from the sp to the ld phase for low segment densities ( @xmath40 ) or to the hd phase for high segment densities ( @xmath41 ) as @xmath4 increases . furthermore , we note that @xmath37 is symmetric around @xmath42 due to the particle - hole symmetry exhibited by the model .",

    "it should be noted that in the sp the velocity is an average over the ( domain - averaged ) velocities of the motors in the ld and hd domains coexisting on the segment .",
    "similarly , the consumed input power per motor is given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the average flux of energy input ( in units of @xmath3 ) . since the input and output fluxes in model i are tightly coupled by construction",

    "furthermore , by considering the product of 1 ) the emp enhancement maximized with respect to the input work and 2 ) the corresponding ratio of output powers for interacting and non - interacting motors , we find for a range of network connectivities and motor densities that the emp enhancement compensates for the loss in the output power induced by exclusion . we have investigated the robustness of such a beneficial trade - off to changes in the internal motor dynamics and provided some strategies for designing motor traffic systems that operate efficiently at maximum power without a significant decrease in the maximum power due to jamming effects .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the present work was inspired by the observation that collective motor traffic of kinesin motors on a single filament exhibits an interaction - induced emp enhancement for a variety of different boundary conditions and model parameter values @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have shown that a qualitatively similar behaviour can be observed in the more general context of exclusion processes on bethe networks .",
    "furthermore , we also expect our conclusions to apply for heterogeneous networks such as , e.g. , poissonian networks @xcite where the relative number of low - density and high - density segments would change with the applied load @xcite , thereby causing a similar response of the velocity to external load as the one found for homogeneous networks .",
