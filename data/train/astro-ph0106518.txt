    "because of the high abundance of fe , the persistence of ne - like fe over a broad temperature range ( @xmath612 mk ) , and the large collision strengths for @xmath7 transitions , the @xmath8@xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) lines of at 1517    are prominent in the x - ray spectra of high - temperature plasmas found in settings as diverse as tokamaks @xcite , the sun @xcite , and both late- and early - type stars @xcite",
    ". the importance of has engendered numerous studies of its atomic structure and level population kinetics , usually with an emphasis on the _ temperature _ dependence of line ratios within the @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath12@xmath14 multiplets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the _ density _ dependence of the x - ray spectrum .    the lowest - lying configurations of are the @xmath8 ground state , the @xmath15 multiplet ( 4 levels , @xmath16739.0 ev ) , the @xmath17 multiplet ( 10 levels , @xmath18789.6 ev ) , and the @xmath19 multiplet ( 12 levels , @xmath20826.0 ev ) . because electron impact excitation from the ground state is strong for transitions into the @xmath21 configurations , but weak for transitions into the @xmath15 configuration , the population flux into the lowest - lying configuration is dominated by radiative cascades originating on higher - lying energy levels , rather than direct excitation from the ground state @xcite .",
    "the four levels of the @xmath15 configuration have , in increasing energy order , total angular momenta @xmath22 , 1 , 0 , and 1 .",
    "the @xmath8@xmath23 transition is strictly forbidden , but the remaining three levels @xmath22 , 1 , and 1 decay to ground , producing lines at 17.10 , 17.05 , and 16.78   , respectively .",
    "the 17.10    line is produced by a magnetic quadrupole transition , but it is nevertheless bright because the upper level is populated efficiently by radiative cascades , and its radiative branching ratio to ground is 1.0 . since the radiative decay rate of this transition is slow compared to the other @xmath12@xmath24 lines , collisional depopulation sets in at lower densities .",
    "thus , the intensity ratio of the 17.10    line to any of the other @xmath12@xmath24 lines provides a diagnostic of the plasma density , as was first pointed out by @xcite .    of these density - dependent line ratios",
    ", we study primarily the @xmath0 line ratio , which has a critical density of a @xmath25 . to utilize this diagnostic in a cosmic x - ray source , we require an instrument with sufficient spectral resolution to cleanly resolve the two lines , and a bright x - ray source with high characteristic densities , intrinsically narrow lines , and low interstellar absorption .",
    "the instrumental requirements are supplied by the high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , and the source requirements are satisfied by nearby magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) : semidetached binaries composed of a magnetic ( @xmath26100  mg ) white dwarf primary and a low - mass secondary .",
    "the global properties are different for polars ( am her stars ) and intermediate polars ( dq  her stars ) , but in both classes of magnetic cvs the flow of material lost by the secondary is channeled onto small spots on the white dwarf surface in the vicinity of the magnetic poles . before reaching the stellar surface , the supersonic [ @xmath27 flow passes through a strong shock [ @xmath28  mk ] , where most of its kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy . for a mass - accretion rate @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and a relative spot size @xmath31 , the density of the flow immediately behind the shock is @xmath32 .",
    "as the flow settles onto the white dwarf , it cools and its density increases , so the density is significantly higher where the temperature reaches a few million degrees , where is the dominant charge state of fe .",
    "doppler broadening of the emission lines is reduced because of the ordered , quasi - radial geometry , and the ever - decreasing velocity ( @xmath33 , hence @xmath34 ) of the post - shock flow .    with its bright x - ray emission lines and low interstellar absorption ,",
    "the well - studied @xcite intermediate polar ex  hydrae is an ideal magnetic cv in which to study high - density plasmas .",
    "spectroscopic evidence for high densities in this source is provided by @xcite , who used the ratio of the / 133    blend to the 129  line observed in an _ euve _ sw spectrum to infer a density @xmath35 for the @xmath36  mk plasma in ex  hya .",
    "below , we use the @xmath37 line ratio observed in a _",
    "hetg spectrum to infer a density @xmath2 for the @xmath38  mk plasma in ex  hya .",
    "we discuss the observations and analysis in  2 , spectral models in  3 , and close with a summary and discussion in  4 .",
    "the _ chandra _ hetg / acis - s observation of ex  hya was performed between 2000 may 18 @xmath39 and may 19 @xmath40 ut for a total exposure of 59.1 ks .",
    "extraction of the grating spectra and calculation of the effective area files was accomplished with the ciao 2.1 suite of software using the reprocessed data products and new calibration data files ( version r4cu5upd8 ) for sequence 300041 . a preliminary discussion of the resulting medium energy grating ( meg ) and high energy grating spectra has been presented by @xcite and @xcite ; here we discuss only the meg spectrum as it bears on the emission spectrum .    a detail of the meg spectrum from 14.5 to 17.5    in shown in figure  1 .",
    "this representation of the spectrum , in @xmath41 , combines @xmath42st orders and is binned by a factor of two to @xmath43   .",
    "as indicated along the top of the figure , the spectrum contains emission lines of , , and .",
    "the striking aspect of this spectrum is the absence of the 17.10    emission line , a feature seen in x - ray spectra of the sun @xcite and other late - type stars @xcite .    to determine the flux in the emission lines",
    ", we fit the meg spectrum over the 14.7215.55    plus 16.6817.20    wavelength interval with a model consisting of a linear background ( to account for the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum obvious in the broadband spectrum ) and eight gaussians ( to account for the six lines and two intervening lyman lines ) . assuming a common gaussian width and offset , the fitting function @xmath44 $ ] . fitting the meg spectrum in @xmath45    bins , separately accounting for @xmath42st orders , results in 540 data points and 528 degrees of freedom . for the wavelengths @xmath46",
    ", we assume the values measured by @xcite for and tabulated by @xcite for .",
    "the resulting fit , combining @xmath42st orders , is shown by the thick gray curve in figure  1 .",
    "it gives @xmath47 and fit parameters as follows : wavelength offset @xmath48 m , gaussian width @xmath49 m , and line fluxes @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "both the wavelength offsets and line widths are consistent with zero , given the absolute wavelength accuracy ( @xmath56 m ) and spectral resolution ( @xmath57  m ) of the meg .    with six line fluxes we can form five independent line ratios , and to compare our values to those measured in the sun we follow @xcite and @xcite and",
    "use the 16.78    line as the reference ; other line ratios of interest are @xmath58 and @xmath0 .",
    "these photon flux line ratios are listed in the middle column of table  1 .",
    "it is important to note that these ratios are virtually unaffected by interstellar absorption : for @xmath59 , the _",
    "largest _ correction amounts to only 1% . for comparison ,",
    "the photon flux line ratios for 33 solar active regions measured by @xcite with the flat crystal spectrometer aboard the _ solar maximum mission _ are listed in the right column of table  1 ( weighted mean and standard deviation ) .",
    "the @xmath60 photon flux ratios for ex  hya and the sun are plotted in the middle panel of figure  3 .",
    "it is seen that the line ratios measured in ex  hya and the sun are consistent with each other , with the exception of the @xmath61 line ratio [ or , equivalently , the @xmath62 line ratio ] , which is far smaller in ex  hya .",
    "from the results of @xcite , the small @xmath63 line ratio observed in ex  hya implies a plasma density in excess of a @xmath64 . to quantify this conclusion , we constructed model spectra for using the livermore x - ray spectral synthesizer ( lxss ) , a suite of idl codes which calculates spectral models of highly charged ions based on hebrew university / lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac ) atomic data .",
    "hullac calculates atomic wavefunctions , level energies , radiative transition rates , and oscillator strengths according to the fully relativistic , multiconfiguration , parametric potential method @xcite .",
    "electron impact excitation rate coefficients are computed quasi - relativistically in the distorted wave approximation @xcite assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "our model includes radiative transition rates for e1 , e2 , m1 , and m2 decays and electron impact excitation rate coefficients for levels with principal quantum number @xmath65 and azimuthal quantum number @xmath66 for a total of 281 levels . using these data",
    ", lxss calculates the level populations for a given temperature and density assuming collisional - radiative equilibrium .",
    "the line intensities are then simply the product of the level populations and the radiative transition rates .    in addition to collisional excitation",
    ", photoexcitation must be accounted for in the calculation of atomic level populations in uv - bright sources like early - type stars and compact binaries .",
    "for example , in he - like ions , photoexcitation competes with collisional excitation to depopulate the @xmath67 level , leading to the conversion of the @xmath68@xmath67 forbidden line @xmath69 into the @xmath68@xmath70 intercombination blend @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the radiation field is strong enough at the appropriate wavelengths , the @xmath72 line ratio can be in the `` high - density limit '' ( @xmath73 ) regardless of the density .",
    "photoexcitation has been shown to explain the low @xmath72 line ratios of early - type stars @xcite , and could explain the low @xmath72 and @xmath74 line ratios observed in ex  hya .    to account for photoexcitation",
    ", we included in the lxss population kinetics calculation the photoexcitation rates @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the continuum spectral energy distribution and @xmath77 are the oscillator strengths of the various transitions . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath78 ( i.e.",
    ", the radiation field is that of a blackbody of temperature @xmath79 ) and the dilution factor of the radiation field is equal to one - half ( i.e. , the x - ray emitting plasma is in close proximity to the source of the photoexcitation continuum ) . both of these assumptions tend to overestimate the importance of photoexcitation .",
    "first , the actual intrinsic spectrum of ex  hya probably has a strong break at the lyman limit , whereas a blackbody does not .",
    "this difference affects transitions with energy spacings @xmath80 ev such as the @xmath67@xmath70 ( @xmath81 ) transitions in si and s , but not those of o , ne , and mg .",
    "second , the uv  euv continuum in ex  hya must be due to both the accretion disk and the accretion - heated surface of the white dwarf . by assuming that the dilution factor is equal to one - half",
    ", we are in effect assuming that the accretion - heated surface of the white dwarf is the dominant source of the uv  euv light . this assumption is justified on the basis of the similarity of the shape and intensity of the fuv spectra of ex  hya ( with a disk ) and am  her ( without a disk ) @xcite . with these assumptions ,",
    "we find for a blackbody temperature @xmath82  kk ( see below ) that all of the he - like @xmath72 line ratios through are significantly affected by photoexcitation , whereas the @xmath63 line ratio is not .    to understand this result , we show in figure  2 a schematic of the important level population processes for the @xmath83 level of : the 17.10    radiative decay ( downward - pointing wavy line ) , collisional excitations ( upward - pointing lines ) , and photoexcitations ( upward - pointing wavy lines ) .",
    "since the @xmath84 level is the first excited level in , we denote it by the subscript `` 2 . ''",
    "the numbers associated with the lines are respectively the radiative decay rate @xmath85 , the collision rate coefficients @xmath86 for @xmath87 mk , and the oscillator strengths @xmath88 ( we report @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the ten transitions into the @xmath17 manifold ) . because of the large effective oscillator strength for photoexcitations into the @xmath17 manifold",
    ", the population of the @xmath83 level , and hence the strength of the 17.10    emission line , can be significantly reduced if the photoexcitation continuum is sufficiently strong in the 190410    waveband responsible for the @xmath83@xmath17 transitions . in",
    "he - like ions , it is the strength of the continuum at the wavelengths of the @xmath67@xmath70 transitions which affects the @xmath72 line ratio . for o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe these wavelengths are 1623 , 1263 , 1036 , 865 , 743 , 637 , 551 , and 404   , respectively . because the relevant waveband for is at shorter wavelengths / higher energies than those of he - like ions , the @xmath74 line ratio is considerably less sensitive to photoexcitation .",
    "we used lxss to calculate spectral models for a blackbody photoexcitation continuum , densities @xmath91@xmath92 , and temperatures @xmath938  mk ( spanning the range for which the ionization fraction is @xmath94 ; @xcite ) . assuming a white dwarf mass @xmath95 ( @xmath96  cm ) and distance @xmath97  pc",
    ", @xcite found that the fuv flux density of ex  hya could be explained if the entire white dwarf surface radiates with a blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath98  kk .",
    "consequently , we assumed for our first set of models that @xmath99  kk and @xmath100 , 4 , and 8  mk .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in the left panel of figure",
    "it is seen that the @xmath101 line ratio shows the most temperature sensitivity , while the @xmath102 line ratio shows the least .",
    "the theoretical ratios are compared to the observed ratios for ex  hya and the sun in the middle panel of the figure  3 . as with other theoretical models of @xcite , we are unable to reproduce the observed @xmath101 [ hence the @xmath103 line ratio , although the value we measure for this ratio is consistent with that measured in the sun .",
    "the observed @xmath104 and @xmath102 line ratios are as predicted by our models , but the @xmath105 and @xmath106 line ratios are too high and too low , respectively , unless the plasma density @xmath2 .",
    "it is alternatively possible that the observed @xmath61 line ratio could be explained if the effective temperature of the photoexcitation continuum is greater than assumed for the set of models discussed above .",
    "indeed , following @xcite , @xcite proposed that the spin - phase modulation of the fuv flux of ex  hya is the result of the varying aspect of a @xmath107  kk hotspot on a @xmath108  kk white dwarf . to investigate the consequences of a hotter photoexcitation continuum",
    ", we assumed for our second set of models that @xmath87  mk ( the peak of the ionization fraction ) and @xmath99 , 40 , 50 , and 60  kk .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in the right panel of figure  3 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath105 and @xmath61 line ratios are sensitive to the temperature of the photoexcitation continuum , whereas the @xmath104 and @xmath102 line ratios are not .",
    "the @xmath61 line ratio is driven toward zero ( the `` high - density limit '' ) for blackbody temperatures @xmath109  kk .    to demonstrate the level of sensitivity to photoexcitation of the @xmath110 line , we show in figure  4 a plot of the @xmath0 line ratio as a function of density assuming a plasma temperature @xmath87  mk and blackbody temperatures @xmath111 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , and 60  kk .",
    "the curve for @xmath111 kk is virtually identical to the curve without photoexcitation . as the blackbody temperature increases",
    ", the line ratio at low densities is seen first to increase slightly and then decrease strongly , approaching the high - density limit for @xmath112  kk .",
    "if the low @xmath0 line ratio observed in ex  hya is due solely to photoexcitation , the blackbody temperature @xmath113  kk . with @xmath114",
    "there is no observable flux in the euv for any of these models ,",
    "so the only constraint is that they not produce too much flux in the uv .",
    "assuming that the maximum 1010    flux density is @xmath115 @xcite , the fractional emitting area of these hotspots must be @xmath116 , 2.6% , 2.0% , and 1.5% for @xmath117 , 50 , 55 , and 60  kk , respectively .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath37 line ratio observed in the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya is significantly smaller than that observed in the sun or other late - type stars .",
    "using lxss , a new plasma code based on hullac atomic data , we find that the observed line ratio can be explained if the plasma density @xmath2 . however , if photoexcitation is included in the level population kinetics , the line ratio can be explained for any density if the photoexcitation temperature @xmath113  kk .",
    "this latter model is consistent with the assumptions ( blackbody emitter , dilution factor equal to one - half ) and the observed uv flux density only if this hotspot , and the overlying volume of million - degree plasma , covers a very small fraction of the surface area of the white dwarf : @xmath118 .",
    "such a hotspot is smaller and hotter than is usually inferred from optical and uv light curves , but it is possible that the accretion - heated photosphere of the white dwarf contains a range of temperatures , with the required @xmath3  kk spot applying only to that unfortunate piece of real estate lying directly beneath the accretion column .",
    "a surrounding larger ( @xmath119 ) and cooler ( @xmath107  kk ) suburb might then produce the flux modulations observed at longer wavelengths , but to account for _ its _ contribution to the uv flux density , the hottest part of the spot would have to be even smaller .",
    "the mean 0.510 kev flux of ex  hya during our observation was @xmath120 , and with a white dwarf mass @xmath121 ( @xmath96  cm ) and distance @xmath122  pc , this implies an x - ray luminosity @xmath123 , hence a mass - accretion rate @xmath124 , hence a post - shock density @xmath125 for @xmath118 .",
    "either way , then , the _ chandra _ hetg spectrum of ex  hya requires a plasma density which is orders of magnitude greater than that observed in the sun or other late - type stars .",
    "the @xmath126 density diagnostic is useful in sources in which the efficacy of the he - like density diagnostics is compromised by the presence of a bright uv continuum .",
    "we thank h.  tananbaum for the generous grant of director s discretionary time which made these observations possible .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge j.  raymond and n.  brickhouse for ongoing discussions about high - density plasma in ex  hya , p.  beiersdorfer and g.  brown for discussions about , j.  saba for providing the solar line ratios listed in table  1 and shown in fig .  3 , and the referee for a number of suggestions which improved the clarity of the manuscript .",
