    "since the announcement of its two resonant planets by @xcite , the planetary system of gj 876 has had a special place in exoplanetary science . as the first system detected with two planets in a mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) , [ planets gj 876 b and c , with minimum masses of 2.27 and 0.71 jupiter - masses and orbital periods of 61.11 and 30.08 days , respectively @xcite ,",
    "are in a 2:1 mean - motion resonance ] , gj 876 has been the subject of extensive research and has had major contributions to the development of the models of planet migration and resonance capture ( @xcite , @xcite ) . because of",
    "the short period gravitational interactions between its two giant planets , the dynamics of this system and the possibility of its hosting additional planetary bodies have been subjects of intense studies . soon after the announcement of its 30-day planet @xcite , @xcite studied the stability of this system and showed that its 2:1 mmr presents the most stable orbital configuration for different values of its planetary masses and orbital elements at different epochs . @xcite and @xcite also studied the dynamics of this system .",
    "these authors argued that because of the relatively small separation between the two giant planets and the possibility of their close approaches , when fitting the system s radial velocities , the interactions between these two planets have to be taken into account . by presenting new fits to the radial velocities of gj 876",
    ", @xcite showed that the system will be stable for long times when the planets orbits are co - planar and have low inclinations with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "@xcite limited this inclination to a range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the results by @xcite and @xcite were later confirmed by the analytical models of @xcite and in a thorough study of the global dynamics of gj 876 by @xcite .",
    "being a dynamically interesting system , gj 876 has also been the target of observation for many years . in 2005 ,",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the new radial velocity data of this star and showed that when planet - planet interaction , stellar jitter , and instrumental uncertainties are taken into account , a 2:1 resonant co - planar orbit with an inclination less than @xmath3 would present the most viable and stable planetary configuration for the two giant planets of this system .",
    "these authors also showed that in addition to being in a 2:1 mmr , the two planets are locked in a secular resonance where they librate around apsidal alignment with an amplitude of @xmath4 , and their joint line of apsides precesses at a rate of @xmath5 every year .",
    "the existence of this secular resonance had also been presented in the works of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite where these authors analyzed the dynamics of gj 876 and presented a model for the migration and resonance capture of its two giant planets .",
    "the continuous observation of gj 876 resulted in even more fundamental discoveries . in 2005",
    ", @xcite announced that a 6.83 earth - masses planet exists in a 1.94-day orbit around this star .",
    "this discovery that marked the detection of the first super - earth planet , prompted many astronomers to examine the possibility of the existence of other earth - like bodies in this system @xcite .",
    "in that direction , @xcite studied the dynamics of fictitious planets in the system of gj 876 and showed that in addition to a small region interior to the orbit of planet c where the super - earth planet of this system has a stable orbit , a region of stability exists beyond the orbit of the outer giant planet ( i.e. , planet b ) corresponding to an exterior 2:1 resonance with this object . in 2010 ,",
    "the prediction by @xcite materialized and a new uranus - mass planet was discovered in a @xmath6-day orbit around gj 876 , making this system the first planetary system with three planets in a laplace resonance .",
    "prior to the detection of its fourth planet , the three - planet system of gj 876 was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the architecture of the system and showed that the assumption of co - planarity is valid , and the mutual inclination of the two giant planets are within @xmath7 to @xmath8 . in a very thorough dynamical analysis , @xcite used the combined data from harps and keck , and while confirming the existence of planet d in a 1.94-day orbit , showed that the orbits of the two giant planets of the system are co - planar with inclinations of approximately @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these authors also suggested that an earth - sized planet in a 15-day orbit at @xmath11 au could have a stable orbit for a long time .",
    "this finding was very interesting since the existence of such an additional planet would help to explain the anomalous high eccentricity of planet d. we would like to mention that in a recent article , @xcite re - analyzed the harps data and suggested that the non - zero eccentricity of planet d may be due to the lack of proper interpretation for red - noise in the data .    with their new four - planet system , @xcite examined the possibility of a stable solution for the planet proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , they were unable to find a signal corresponding to the 15-day planet in their radial velocity observations . placing test particles in the region around 0.08 au and integrating the entire system numerically , these authors found that only a small fraction of particles remained stable for the 10 myr duration of the integration .",
    "given the resonant state of the three planets of the system , and that these planets have most probably captured each other in resonance while migrating inwards from outer regions , and also given the fact that gj 876 is an m star and planet formation around m stars favors the formation of low - mass objects , it would be natural to examine whether gj 876 can host additional ( low - mass ) planets , in particular an earth - like object in a 15-day orbit .",
    "this paper addresses this and several other questions regarding the dynamics of the planetary system of gj 876 .    in the rest of this paper , we present our methodology and the results of our extensive numerical analysis of the dynamics of the system .",
    "we are particularly interested in the dynamical surrounding of the fitted orbit of planet e as given in table 3 of @xcite , and the possibility of additional planets in the system including the earth - sized planet proposed by @xcite .",
    "we discuss our numerical method in section [ sec : vareq ] , and present the results in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes our analysis where we also discuss their implications for the formation of this planetary system .",
    "as mentioned above , the goal of our study is to examine the possibility of the existence of additional bodies in the four - planet system of gj 876 .",
    "our approach is to use stability analysis to identify regions where an object can have a long - term stable orbit .",
    "since there is no analytical solution to a general @xmath12-body problem with @xmath13 , the orbital evolution of the planetary system of gj 876 has to be computed numerically . as explained below",
    ", we will use a symplectic integrator for this purpose . due to their reliability and stability properties , especially for long - term integrations",
    ", these integrators have found a special place in celestial mechanics and planetary dynamics .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general overview of symplectic integrators and to , for instance , @xcite , and @xcite for applications of these integrators to celestial mechanics .",
    "to study the dynamical stability of an object , one has to identify ( and exclude ) conditions that result in chaotic motion of the body .",
    "several methods exist for this purpose that discriminate between regular and chaotic motions .",
    "one can either analyze the orbit of a particular object [ using e.g. , the frequency analysis technique @xcite ] , or study the evolution of deviation vectors @xmath14 from a given orbit .",
    "examples of the latter include the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent @xmath15 [ for a review , see e.  g. @xcite ] , the fast lyapunov indicator technique ( fli ) @xcite , the smaller alignment index ( sali ) method @xcite and its generalization gali @xcite , and the megno ( mean exponential growth of nearby orbits ) chaos indicator @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on megno as a fast and reliable method to study the dynamics of single orbits @xcite .",
    "for this chaos indicator , the variation of a quantity @xmath16 and its mean value @xmath17 during time @xmath18 are given by    @xmath19    the quantity @xmath20 in equations ( [ eq : megno ] ) denotes the derivative of the deviation vector with respect to the independent variable @xmath21 . to determine the stability of an orbit",
    ", one has to analyze the time evolution of @xmath17 , which is connected to the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent of the orbit . for stable , periodic orbits ,",
    "@xmath17 approaches 0 asymptotically , while for quasi - periodic ones it will tend to 2 . for chaotic initial conditions , @xmath17 will grow with time as @xmath22 .",
    "the lyapunov time , defined as @xmath23 , can therefore be obtained from @xmath17 using    @xmath24    in this equation , @xmath18 is the total integration time .",
    "the above - mentioned variational equations have to be integrated together with the equations of motion of the system . to increase the speed of these computations",
    ", we used a symplectic integrator , and integrated the entire set of equations of the system simultaneously .",
    "@xcite discuss different methods of employing these integrators for advancing the variational equations of a hamiltonian system .",
    "the most efficient of these methods , the so called _ tangent map ( tm ) _ technique , was applied by @xcite and @xcite mainly to low - dimensional hamiltonian systems with 2 and 3 degrees of freedom . @xcite",
    "have shown that this method can also be applied to multi - dimensional hamiltonian systems and is very efficient and superior to other commonly used numerical schemes , both in accuracy and speed .",
    "we note that the tm method was first discussed in the context of celestial mechanics by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the dynamical stability of hypothetical planets in the system of gj 876 for a wide range of their orbital elements . to make this task computationally feasible , we use the saba@xmath25/sbab@xmath25 integrators developed by @xcite , which proved to be efficient and reliable .",
    "these symplectic splitting integrators have been designed specifically for integrating hamiltonian systems of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are separately integrable , and @xmath29 , as in the case of hierarchical @xmath12-body systems . for more details on this technique and on different methods of splitting the hamiltonian into two integrable parts ,",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "as mentioned above , we used the tm method to compute the variational equations .",
    "the formulas for advancing variational equations using a symplectic integrator can be found in e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used these formalisms , specifically the latter , where also a time - discrete approximation of equations ( [ eq : megno ] ) is given .",
    "let us finally note that symplectic methods can not be used with a trivial automated step - size control .",
    "therefore , they are usually implemented with a fixed integration step , which is denoted by @xmath30 in this paper .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our stability analysis for the gj 876 planetary system .",
    "we used the saba@xmath31 symplectic integrator @xcite to integrate the equations of motion and the variational equations of the system .",
    "the latter are computed only for the test particles , which we define in this study to be always massless and used to determine the stability in the specific regions .",
    "note that all orbital elements are given with respect to the central body and integrations were carried out incorporating only newtonian gravity .",
    "no relativistic and tidal effects were included .      of gj 876    one of the exciting results of the dynamical analysis of gj 876 by @xcite",
    "is the suggestion that a stable region exists for an earth - sized planet at @xmath32 au .",
    "this island of stability that corresponds to an orbital period of 15 days , would allow a terrestrial planet to be in a three - body 1:2:4 resonance with the two giant planets of the system .",
    "the interesting fact is that if this 15-day planet exists , it may be possible to use the interaction between this object and the innermost planet of the system ( the 6.5 earth - masses super - earth that orbits the central star in a 1.94-day orbit ) as a way to account for the relatively high eccentricity of the latter body .    despite the predictions of @xcite , radial velocity observations have not been able to detect a planet in the 15-day orbit .",
    "instead , observations by @xcite revealed that an additional planet does exist in the system , but it is uranus - mass and in an orbit with a period of approximately 125 days .",
    "this body is currently the outermost planet of gj 876 system , and as shown by @xcite , forms a three - body laplace resonance with the two inner giant planets .",
    "the purpose of our study is to determine how the discovery of this new planet affects the stability of the 15-day orbit . in other words",
    ", we would like to examine whether an earth - sized planet can maintain a stable orbit at 0.083 au in this new four - planet configuration ?",
    "a few simulations by @xcite suggested that stable motion may be possible around @xmath32 au .",
    "however , those simulations had been carried out only for short integration times .",
    "our goal is to study also the long - term stability of orbits in this region .",

    "> from this figure , it can be seen that the stable island at @xmath33 au still exists .",

    "this figure also shows that the region corresponding to the most stable orbits ( the darkest area ) is now exclusively for test particles in circular motion .",

    "this time span is sufficient to identify unstable regions at reasonable cpu costs , especially when the grids in semimajor axis , eccentricity , and other orbital elements are very dense .",
    "however , it is not long enough to allow us to make conclusions about the long - term stability of the identified stable regions . for the latter ,",

    "we , therefore , considered a test particle with orbital elements corresponding to the most stable zone around 0.083 au ( the darkest spot in fig .",

    "[ f1].,title=\"fig : \" ]    as mentioned before , the main purpose for carrying out these simulations was to determine the extent to which the stability of an object in the 15-day orbit would be affected by the newly discovered planet of the system . in that respect , and in order to be able to make a comparison with the stability analysis of the system prior to the detection of planet e , it is necessary to carry out similar @xmath12-body integrations for the 15-day orbit test particle with only planets b , c , and d included .",
    "we used the orbital elements of these planets as in model ii and integrated the orbit of the same test particle as in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , for 1 myr .",
    "these results are presented as black dots in the right panel of fig .",
    "we found that for this configuration , the orbit of the test particle was stable for the entire duration of the integration .",
    "the latter indicates that the addition of planet e had a profound effect on the stability of this object .",
    "given that the orbit of our test particle was the least chaotic one in the area around 0.083 au , this result further suggests that the region between planets b , c , and e in the system of gj 876 is naturally unstable . in other words",
    ", the system of gj 876 seems to be dynamically full .",
    "we also examined the stability of an object exterior to the orbit of planet e. we used the orbital elements of the planets from table  [ tab : t2 ] ( model iii ) and carried out similar simulations for test particles in the region of @xmath50 au .",

    "as shown there , a large stable region exists outside the orbit of planet e where the system can host additional planets .",

    "for instance , the large gap at 0.53 au corresponds to a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet b. figure [ f5 ] also shows that as the semimajor axis of an object increases , stability extends to orbits with larger eccentricities .",

    "[ f5 ] is the small islands of stability that appear at high eccentricities outside the gaps of instability that are due to mean - motion resonances .",

    "we presented the results of a detailed study of the stability of the planetary system of gj 876 .",
    "our goal was to determine whether an earth - sized planet could maintain a stable orbit in a four - body resonance configuration with the currently known planets of the system .",
    "we computed the value of the chaos indicator megno for a large number of massless test particles to map the system s orbital parameter - space , and identified regions where the orbit of an additional object could be stable .",
    "results suggested an island of stability in and around the 15-day orbit .",
    "however , direct integration of test particles showed that even orbits that were initially very stable in that region became unstable in later times .",
    "we would like to emphasize that although when comparing to jovian - type planets , a test particle is a good approximation for a terrestrial - class object , the dynamical state of a test particle may not be a true representative of the dynamics of an actual earth - sized body .",
    "the mutual interactions between this object and other bodies in the system play an important role in its dynamical state and may result in a stable orbital configuration in systems where test particle simulations indicate instability . in the case of gj 876 ,",
    "however , we believe that the possibility of the existence of such an earth - sized planet is very small . given the current masses of the three giant planets of the system and their orbital configuration , in order for a fifth planet in the 15-day orbit to be stable , the mass of this object has to be larger than earth - mass so that its mutual interactions with other planets would become significant to allow its ( in)stability . given the long history of the observation of gj 876  ( over 12 years ) , such a planet is expected to have been discovered by now .",
    "results of our study suggest that the planetary system of gj 876 is most likely dynamically full .",
    "it is also worth noting that from hill radius calculations , one may argue that an additional , not too massive planet with a small eccentricity can maintain stability in the 15-day orbit .",
    "although this argument has been shown to be valid in many multiple planet system , our numerical integrations indicate that in the system of gj 876 , hill radius analysis may not be a good approach for identifying stability .",
    "the latter implies that this widely used technique has to be used with caution as it may not yield correct results at all times .",
    "the orbital architecture of the planets around gj 876 , with a super - earth in a close - in orbit and three planets in a laplace resonance , combined with the fact that this system is dynamically full , raises an important and interesting question : how did this planetary system form ? given that gj 876 is an m star , it is very unlikely that its outer three planets were formed in their current orbits .",
    "in fact , as shown by @xcite , the core - accretion model of giant planet formation fails to produce jovian - type planets around m stars .",
    "the fact that many m stars host giant planets suggests that these planets must have formed in outer regions of the circumstellar disk and migrated to their current orbits . as shown by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", migrating planets may capture other bodies in their paths into mean - motion resonances ( mainly the 1:2 resonance ) where the two ( or multiple ) resonant bodies continue their migration until they either collide with the central star or reside in a stable orbit . for a more detailed and comprehensive review on the formation , migration , and resonance trapping of giant planets around m stars ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "while migrating inward , the resonant planets excite the orbits of smaller bodies causing many of them to be scattered out of the system .",
    "some of these bodies may also collide with one another and form larger objects ( e.g. , super - earths ) .",
    "the interactions between these objects and the migrating planets may result in their scattering to stable close - in orbits .",
