    "the formation and propagation of astrophysical jets are strongly affected by plasma instabilities , whose study is therefore of fundamental importance for understanding their dynamics and their associated phenomenology . in jets",
    "there are several possible different kinds of instability , among them the most studied are the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) driven by the velocity shear between the jet and the ambient medium and the current driven instability ( cdi ) associated with a longitudinal current and therefore with the toroidal component of magnetic field .",
    "since the most promising models for the acceleration and collimation of jets involve the presence of a magnetic field with footpoints anchored to a rotating object ( an accretion disk or a spinning star or black hole ) , the presence of a toroidal field component is a natural consequence and cdi may play an important role in the jet propagation . among cdi ,",
    "the @xmath1 kink mode is the most effective , leading to an helical displacement of the whole jet body , and for this reason is the only one we will consider in this paper .",
    "recent numerical simulations have shown the development of such instabilities both in newtonian @xcite and in relativistic @xcite jets .",
    "an important step towards a better understanding of simulation results is a linear analysis of the instabilities , that is still largely missing for the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) regime .",
    "khi have been extensively studied in several different configurations in the newtonian ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and relativistic ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cases , but very few linear analyses have been presented for a relativistic magnetized jet @xcite .",
    "similarly , cdi have been widely studied in the newtonian limit ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , for the relativistic mhd case , only the force - free limit has been considered @xcite .",
    "@xcite have considered the case in which the longitudinal magnetic field is constant , showing that in this case the jet is stable , on the contrary @xcite showed that jets with longitudinal magnetic field decreasing outward can be unstable .",
    "@xcite finally derived a general necessary condition for instability .",
    "the force - free limit is valid when the energy density of electromagnetic fields is much larger than the energy density of matter , i.e. when the jet energy flux is mainly in the form of poynting flux .",
    "acceleration models predict that jets start being poynting dominated and progressively undergo a transition to a matter dominated state , but how fast the transition occurs is uncertain . from the observational point of view , the evidence is that , above the parsec scale , jets can not be poynting dominated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that jet instabilities may play a role in this conversion and that blazar activity could be linked to the development of such instabilities either through shock formation or through direct magnetic energy dissipation processes .",
    "these considerations suggest that it is very important to go beyond the force - free limit in the instability analysis and this is exactly the aim of the present paper in which we will analyze the linear stability properties of a cylindrical magnetized relativistic flow , taking into account the effects of matter inertia , but still neglecting thermal pressure .",
    "since the equilibrium configurations of the jet may be quite complex , with many possible sources of instabilities , like the longitudinal jet velocity , the toroidal field and the jet rotation , we will not start from a full configuration where all the above elements are present , but from a simpler case where one of the above elements , namely rotation , is absent .",
    "the additional effects introduced by rotation will then be examined in a following paper . in section 2",
    "we will describe the physical problem , the relevant equations , the general equilibrium configuration and the relevant parameters , while in section 3 we will derive the linearized equations and describe the procedure for finding the normal modes . in section 4",
    "we will present the results of our analysis for the non rotating case , first for a static configuration and then for a moving jet . finally in section 5",
    "we will summarize our findings .",
    "we study the stability of a cold ( zero pressure ) relativistic magnetized cylindrical flow .",
    "the relevant equations are continuity and momentum coupled with maxwell equations : @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the proper density , @xmath7 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are respectively the velocity , magnetic field , electric field and current 3-vectors .",
    "the units are chosen so that the speed of light is @xmath12 , we also remark that in the following a factor of @xmath13 will be reabsorbed in the definitions of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first step in the stability analysis is to define an equilibrium state satisfying the stationary form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drho / dt]- [ eq : de / dt ] ) and this will be done in the next subsection .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath14 ( with versors @xmath15 ) and seek for axisymmetric steady - state solutions for a relativistic magnetized jet , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the jet propagates in the vertical ( @xmath17 ) direction and the magnetic field configuration consists of a vertical ( poloidal ) component @xmath18 and a toroidal component @xmath19 and can be expressed as @xmath20 the magnetic field configuration can be characterized by the pitch parameter @xmath21 from the stationarity condition , the continuity equation and the independence of @xmath22 on @xmath17 and @xmath23 , we get @xmath24 and from the condition @xmath25 we obtain that the velocity can then be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fluid toroidal velocity and @xmath28 is the angular velocity of field lines and they are related by @xmath29 the electric field is always directed radially and can be expressed as @xmath30    the only remaining non - trivial equation is given by the radial component of the momentum equation ( [ eq : dm / dt ] ) which simplifies to @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath33 reduces to @xmath19 and the equilibrium condition acquire the classical newtonian form @xmath34 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eq ] ) or ( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) leave the freedom of choosing the radial profiles of all flow variables but one and then solve for the remaining profile .",
    "we begin by prescribing the profiles of the proper density and lorentz factor that well describe a jet configuration , with the velocity and density variations concentrated inside the jet radius @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ambient / jet density contrast , @xmath38 is the lorentz factor relative to the @xmath17 component of the velocity only , while @xmath39 is the lorentz factor on the axis where the vertical flow velocity is @xmath40 . from now on",
    ", we will use the subscript @xmath41 to denote values at @xmath42 .",
    "we note that , in the newtonian case , the presence of a longitudinal velocity has no effect on the radial equilibrium eq .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) , while it changes the relativistic eq .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eq ] ) modifying the centrifugal term .    in the newtonian limit , it is then customary to prescribe the profile of the azimuthal field @xmath19 and this choice is more arbitrary since we have no direct information about the magnetic configuration in astrophysical jets .",
    "the choice of the @xmath19 distribution is equivalent to a choice of the distribution of the longitudinal component of the current and also determines the behavior of the pitch parameter @xmath43 , that is important for the stability properties . in principle",
    ", one can then have several equilibria characterized by different forms of the current distribution , that can be more or less concentrated , can peak on the axis or at the jet boundary , and can close in different ways ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this limit , we start by considering the azimuthal field profile @xmath44\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the magnetization radius and @xmath46 determines the maximum field strength",
    ". this profile corresponds to a current distribution peaked on the jet axis and , choosing @xmath47 , concentrated inside the jet .",
    "in addition , one can assume that the current closes at very large distances from the jet .",
    "in the relativistic limit the most natural generalization is to prescribe in a similar way the behavior of @xmath33 @xmath48\\,.\\ ] ] we observe that , in the absence of rotation , @xmath33 represents the azimuthal field strength measured in the proper frame . prescribing the profile of @xmath33 instead of @xmath19 modifies the current profile in the laboratory frame , introducing a return current in the region of the velocity shear and this has consequences for the stability properties as it will be discussed below .",
    "furthermore , the equilibrium configuration may be modified by the presence of rotations to different degrees : in one extreme case the gradient of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eq ] ) ( or the gradient of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eqmhd ] ) ) is exactly balanced by the centrifugal force and @xmath18 is constant , in the other extreme it is balanced by the gradient of @xmath51 .",
    "this suggests to introduce , more generally , a parameter @xmath52 $ ] so that the equilibrium poloidal magnetic field is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the error function , @xmath55 corresponds to the absence of rotation , while @xmath56 corresponds to maximum rotation . introducing the expression for @xmath18 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bz_prof ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : radial_eq ] ) we can get the azimuthal velocity from @xmath57 finally the azimuthal field is obtained from the definition of @xmath58 using @xmath59 .",
    "this yields a quadratic equation in @xmath19 with solution @xmath60 here we consider the negative branch because it guarantees that @xmath19 and @xmath27 have opposite signs , as suggested by acceleration models .",
    "thus , in our model the radial profile of the pitch parameter , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pitch ] ) , is always negative .",
    "we choose to control the magnetic field configuration by specifying the value of the pitch on the axis @xmath61 and the ratio between the energy density of the matter and the magnetic energy density @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 represents the average across the beam : @xmath65 we note that @xmath66 by construction although the radial profile of the pitch parameter ( eq . [ eq : pitch ] ) using the negative branch of eq ( [ eq : bphi ] ) in the definition of @xmath19 is always negative .",
    "the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 appearing in the above equations can be found in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath69 from the simultaneous solution of the two expressions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_cnd_ma ] ) , together with ( [ eq : bav ] ) . in particular , from the definition of the pitch parameter , after some algebra we find ( in the @xmath70 limit ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 . in practice ,",
    "eq ( [ eq : bz0 ] ) is used to compute @xmath67 for trial values of @xmath68 until the prescribed value of magnetic energy is satisfied .",
    "summarizing , our equilibrium configuration depends on the 5 parameters @xmath37 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath61 and @xmath75 specifying , respectively , the jet density contrast , bulk flow velocity , strength of centrifugal force , magnetic pitch and the ratio between the energy density of the matter and the magnetic energy density .",
    "let us consider small perturbations @xmath76 to the equilibrium state described above , which hereafter will be identified by a zero subscript .",
    "the linearized continuity , momentum , induction equations and the ideal mhd conditions are @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    assuming now the perturbations to be of the form @xmath81 , after lengthy algebraic manipulations described in the appendix [ ap : linear ] , we arrive at a system of two first order differential equations in the radial coordinate for the two basic variables  the radial displacement @xmath82 and the perturbed electromagnetic pressure @xmath83 defined as @xmath84 and @xmath85 the system of equations can then be written as @xmath86    @xmath87\\xi_{1r}+ \\\\+ \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\rho_0\\gamma_0 ^ 2v_{0\\varphi}^2c_3 - 2d + \\frac{c_6}{r } \\right)+ c_7 \\pi_1 \\label{eq : dp / dr}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath88\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath89 the quantities @xmath90 depend on the chosen profiles of the equilibrium solution and are given in the appendix [ ap : coefficients ] .",
    "these two equations together with the appropriate boundary conditions represent an eigenvalue problem , where @xmath91 is the eigenvalue ( we observe that we here adopt a temporal approach to the stability analysis ) .",

    "the equations are singular but the solutions have to be regular while at infinity the solutions have to decay and no incoming wave is allowed ( sommerfeld condition ) . for finding the eigenvalue we use a shooting method with a complex secant root finder .",
    "the numerical integration can not start at @xmath42 ( because of the singularity ) , so we start at a small distance from the origin where the solution is obtained through a series expansion of the equations described in the appendix [ ap : small_r ] .",
    "similarly , we start a backward integration from a sufficiently large radius , where the asymptotic solution is obtained as described in the appendix [ ap : large_r ] and then we match the two numerical solutions at an intermediate radius .",
    "furthermore , we have to consider that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dxi / dr ] ) and ( [ eq : dp / dr ] ) may have singular points , that arise in the following cases :    1 .   when the doppler shifted frequency , @xmath95 , appearing in the denominators in @xmath96 and @xmath97 , becomes zero at some @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "this is a well - known corotation singularity , when the phase speed of a wave perturbation coincides with the basic flow velocity at @xmath98 and corresponds to resonant interaction between waves and the background jet flow .",

    "2 .   when the determinant becomes zero at some @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the latter condition is a quadratic equation with respect to @xmath95 that gives @xmath102 from which we derive a phase speed equal to that of a relativistic alfvn wave ( see keppens & meliani 2008 , eq .",

    "the above determinant is zero and therefore equations ( [ eq : dxi / dr ] ) and ( [ eq : dp / dr ] ) have singular , or resonant points at @xmath100 , where the phase speed of the wave perturbation coincides with that of relativistic alfvn waves . like the corotation singularity , this singularity is also physical , and results from the resonant interaction of perturbations with relativistic alfvn waves .",
    "+ @xcite have discussed the proper way to handle these singularities , however , since singular points are found only for real values of @xmath91 and since we are interested in unstable modes and therefore complex values of @xmath91 , we can assume that our integration will always avoid singular points .",
    "before discussing in detail our results , however , we recall in section [ subsec : parameters ] the units we will use , the full set of parameters defining our problem and which ones will be investigated in more detail in the present work",
    ". we then preliminarly examine the static case in subsection [ subsec : static ] , the full case in subsection [ subsec : moving ] and finally a more detailed analysis of the cdi is performed in subsection [ subsec : cd ] .      as discussed in section [ sec : equilibrium ] ,",
    "the basic equilibrium state is determined by five parameters : the jet density contrast @xmath37 , the bulk flow velocity which is derived from @xmath73 , the rotation parameter @xmath74 , the pitch on the axis @xmath61 and the ratio @xmath75 between the energy density of the matter and the magnetic energy density .",
    "we notice that our parameter @xmath106 is the inverse of the magnetization parameter often used in the literature . in the present paper ,",

    "given that the absolute value of the pitch is monotonically increasing with radius , we note that the resonant position , expressed by the condition @xmath190 , has to shift to larger radii as @xmath151 is decreased .",

    "the scaling is excellent around the maximum of the growth rate , where the eigenfunction is more concentrated in the jet core .",

    "we recall that the value of the parameter @xmath45 determines the width of the current distribution and we can then ask how the results depend on it .",
    "the width of the current distribution is related to the extent of the flat part in the pitch profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pitch ] ) : thus , if we decrease @xmath45 , the pitch grows to larger values inside the jet , the inner mode becomes stabilized at lower wavenumbers and the outer mode is also found at lower wavenumbers .",
    "the position of the stable region between the inner and outer branches is therefore a function of the value of @xmath45 and moves towards smaller wavenumbers ( when @xmath45 is decreased ) and to larger wavenumbers ( when @xmath45 is increased ) .",
    "in addition , the growth rate of the outer branch , being found at small values of @xmath151 , decreases with @xmath45 , while the growth rate of the inner branch is only determined by @xmath61 and does not depend on @xmath45 .",
    "we then expect that , by decreasing @xmath45 , the inner mode will become dominant . as an example , we show in fig . [",

    "[ fig : cd ] .",
    "we can now summarize the results obtained for the cdi in the relativistic regime : we have two branches of instability , an inner mode concentrated inside the jet and an outer mode in which the perturbation is concentrated outside the jet .",
    "the relative importance of the two branches depends both on the current concentration determined by the parameter @xmath45 and on the lorentz factor @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , as we decrease @xmath45 , the growth rate of the outer branch also decreases and the mode shifts towards smaller wavenumbers , while the growth rate of the inner branch does not change .",
    "conversely , as we increase @xmath73 , the growth rate of the inner branch decreases while the growth rate of the outer branch does not change .",
    "we have examined the stability properties of a relativistic magnetized cylindrical flow in the approximation of zero thermal pressure , neglecting also the effects of rotation and focusing only on the @xmath0 mode . in this configuration",
    "we have two kinds of instability that may be present : kelvin - helmholtz and current driven .",
    "the instability behavior depends of course on the chosen equilibrium configuration and this is somewhat arbitrary since we have no direct information on the magnetic field structure , although some indications are provided by the acceleration models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the general outcome and the properties of the solutions obtained for a particular configuration , such as the one we adopted here , can be considered valid for a more general class of equilibria .",
    "our results can then be considered representative of an equilibrium configuration characterized by a distribution of current concentrated in the jet , with the return current assumed to be mainly found at very large distances .",
    "we can summarize our results by considering the behavior of the system for different values of the ratio between matter and magnetic energy densities . for matter dominated flows ,",
    "the dominant instability is kh and the wavenumber corresponding to the maximum growth rate as well as the growth rate itself scale both as @xmath170 . somewhat above",
    "equipartion khi reaches its maximum growth rate and then it becomes rapidly stabilized . below this stabilization limit",
    "the dominant instability becomes cdi    the dependence of the khi on the value of the pitch is relatively weak and only for the smallest value of the axial pitch ( @xmath61 ) , in the relativistic case , we observe a displacement of the stability limit towards lower values of @xmath108 and a merging with cdi .",
    "cdi are therefore prevailing for flows in equipartition or magnetically dominated and the dependence on @xmath108 in these regimes is quite weak . the wavenumber corresponding to the maximum growth rate scale as @xmath117 , the growth rate itself increases with decreasing @xmath61 .",
    "and the modes have a resonant character with a peak in the eigenfunction at the radial position where @xmath188 .    at low jet velocity ,",
    "our equilibrium has no return current inside the domain , while at relativistic velocities we have a small portion of the return current corresponding to the velocity shear region .",
    "the corresponding steepening of the pitch profiles induces a stabilization of the modes for which the resonance condition corresponds to radial positions where the return current is found .",
    "we then observe a splitting of the cdi in two branches , one at high wavenumbers ( the inner mode ) characterized by an eigenfunction with a resonant peak in the inner radial part of the flow , and one at smaller wavenumbers ( the outer mode ) for which the resonant peak is outside the jet region . which of the two branches is dominant depends on the width of the current distribution and on the lorentz factor of the flow .",
    "an increase in the current concentration ( small @xmath45 ) favors the growth of the inner mode , while an increase in @xmath73 enhances the development of the outer mode .",
    "the different behavior in the explored parameter ranges may have crucial implications for the nonlinear stages as distinct types of instability may evolve differently .",
