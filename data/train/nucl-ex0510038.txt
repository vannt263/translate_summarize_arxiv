    "[ fig : spectraandraa ]    in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : spectraandraa ] we plot the @xmath9 for identified particles at rapidity @xmath1 for @xmath10 central au  +  au collisions at @xmath0 . dashed and",
    "dotted lines represent the expectation of scaling with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , while the shaded boxes are the systematic errors resulting from the uncertainties of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this figure shows suppression of pions ( left - hand panel ) and kaons ( middle panel ) at values of about 0.4 and 0.7 , respectively , similar for both particle signs , and basically independent of @xmath3 in the measured @xmath3 ranges .",
    "@xmath9 for protons however , plotted in the right - hand panel , exhibit an enhancement peak at @xmath11 .",
    "the increase of the calculated nuclear modification factor with increasing mass from pions via kaons to protons may be attributed to coalescence or radial flow .",
    "however explanation of the different shape of @xmath9 for protons requires invoking particle production mechanisms that depend on the number of quarks , such as baryon junction  @xcite or parton recombination  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : phenixraa ] we compare the @xmath9 calculated for pions and protons at @xmath1 with the ratios obtained by the phenix collaboration at mid - rapidity .",
    "data show very similar behavior for both rapidities in the @xmath3 range covered by brahms , which , combined with other brahms results  @xcite , indicate the flatness of @xmath9 with rapidity for central au  +  au collisions .     for pions ( left - hand panel ) and protons ( right - hand panel ) at mid - rapidity and @xmath1 .",
    "solid circles are phenix data  @xcite at mid - rapidity , open squares show brahms preliminary data . ]",
    "[ fig : phenixraa ]        [ fig : auauraanpart ]    the magnitude of the suppression can also be studied as a function of the system size .",
    "averaged @xmath9 for pions in the @xmath3 range from 2.0 to @xmath12 has been plotted in figure  [ fig : auauraanpart ] as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "as expected , there is less suppression at peripheral events . when compared with the phenix data obtained for neutral pions at mid - rapidity we can see that although for central events @xmath9 seems to be independent of rapidity , for the peripheral events nuclear modification factor seen at forward rapidity reaches value close to unity , larger than the phenix data .",
    "a simple finding is that similar mechanisms such as parton recombination occur at central collisions at mid- and forward rapidities , however this similarity breaks down for peripheral events .",
    "brahms experiment has measured particle distributions for identified hadrons in au  +  au and p  +  p collisions at @xmath0 at forward rapidity of @xmath1 .",
    "spectra were used to construct the nuclear modification factor , which shows suppression for mesons independent of the transverse momenta , and enhancement for protons and antiprotons around @xmath11 .",
    "systematic difference between mesons and baryons , which moreover seems to be independent of rapidity for central events ( at least up to rapidity @xmath1 ) , indicates existence of various mechanisms of particle production .",
    "remarkable independence of the investigated ratios on rapidity can be attributed to the surface emission picture  @xcite , where changes in @xmath14 result in a nearly flat dependence of @xmath9 , albeit an increase of @xmath9 is expected for @xmath15 .",
    "surprising feature is revealed when comparing nuclear modification factor dependence on centrality at mid - rapidity and at large rapidity .",
    "observed enhancement of the ratio at @xmath1 for the peripheral events may indicate change of the medium properties when going from mid- to forward rapidity .",
    "the conclusion might be drawn that the strongly interacting matter that quenches particle production at high @xmath3 extends to much higher rapidities in the central events than in the peripheral events .",

    "<S> these results are found to be very similar in strength to that observed at mid - rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we see a gradual decrease of the observed suppression towards more peripheral collisions .    first collisions of gold ions at nucleon - nucleon center of mass energies @xmath2 at rhic revealed a dramatic decrease of pion production at high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) , as compared to an incoherent sum of pions produced in the p  +  p collisions at the same energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high @xmath3 hadrons are primarily produced from the fragmentation of the hard - scattered partons and observed suppression could be either due to initial state parton saturation inside the nuclei  @xcite or due to final state jet energy degradation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial test of these different mechanisms has been performed during the third rhic run when collisions between deuterium and gold ions at @xmath0 were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements showed that the high @xmath3 particle production from d  +  au collisions around mid - rapidity is not suppressed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of this phenomena supports the interpretation that the observed suppression in the au  +  au collisions is due to the final interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however it was also observed in the brahms experiment that at forward pseudo - rapidity @xmath4 inclusive negatively charged hadrons are suppressed in both central au  +  au and minimum - bias d  +  au collisions  @xcite , which might be attributed to the possible existence of the nuclei in the color glass condensate phase  @xcite prior to the collisions . </S>",
    "<S> studying the magnitude of suppression as a function of rapidity and centrality is essential to help understanding different mechanism responsible for this phenomenon .    to study the in - medium effects on the spectra it is often useful to plot the nuclear modification factor , which is the ratio of the yield obtained from nucleus - nucleus collisions scaled with the number of binary collisions , to the yield from elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions :    @xmath5    in the absence of any nuclear effects the ratio should saturate at unity for high @xmath3 , where production is dominated by hard scatterings and is proportional to the number of binary collisions , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> production in the low @xmath3 region is dominated by soft processes and scales with the number of participants , @xmath7 , which is _ circa _ three times smaller for central au  +  au collisions than @xmath6 . </S>"
