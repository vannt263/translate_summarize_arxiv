    "according to the most general definition of a system ( see e.g. @xcite ) , by a discrete system ( further  a system ) we understand a stationary dynamical system with a discrete time @xmath6 ; that is , a 5-tuple @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a non - empty finite set , the _ input alphabet _ ; @xmath9 is a non - empty finite set , the _ output alphabet _ ; @xmath10 is a non - empty ( possibly , infinite ) set of _ states _ ; @xmath11 is a _ state transition function _ ; @xmath12 is an _",

    "multiplication and addition of infinite words over alphabet @xmath31 can be defined via school - textbook - like algorithms for multiplication / addition of integers represented by base-@xmath29 expansions .",
    "for instance , in case of 2-adic integers ( i.e. , when @xmath149 ) the following example shows that @xmath150 in @xmath5 ( as @xmath151 ) :    @xmath152    the next example shows that @xmath153 in @xmath5 ( as @xmath154 ) :    @xmath155    the set of all infinite words over the alphabet @xmath31 with so defined operations ( and distance ) constitutes the ring ( and the metric space ) @xmath126 .",

    "it is also worth noticing that when @xmath149 , the 2-adic integers representing negative rational integers may be regarded as _ 2 s complements _ of the latter ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . in computer science ,",

    "thus , for @xmath172 , the following equivalences hold : @xmath173 due to equivalence , one may use congruences between @xmath29-adic numbers rather than inequalities for @xmath29-adic absolute values which is sometimes more convenient during proofs .",
    "the advantage of using congruences rather than inequalities in @xmath29-adic analysis over @xmath126 is that one may work with congruences by applying standard number - theoretic techniques ; e.g. , add or multiply congruences sidewise , etc .",
    "more about this in @xcite .",
    "metrics on cartesian powers @xmath174 can be defined in a manner similar to that of the case @xmath175 : @xmath176 for every @xmath177 ; so @xmath29-adic continuous multi - variate functions defined on and valuated @xmath126 can be considered as well .",
    "once the metric is defined , one can speak of limits , of continuous functions , of derivatives .",
    "of convergent series , etc . ; that is , of @xmath29-adic calculus .",
    "we refer to the numerous books on @xmath29-adic analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) for further details .",
    "an important example of continuous 2-adic functions are basic computer instructions , both arithmetic ( addition , multiplication , subtraction ) and bitwise logical ( @xmath178 , the bitwise conjunction ; @xmath179 , the bitwise disjunction ; @xmath180 , the bitwise exclusive ` or ' ; @xmath181 , the bitwise negation ) and some others ( shifts towards higher order bits , masking ) .",
    "all these instructions can be regarded as ( univariate or two - variate ) 1-lipschitz functions defined on and valuated in the space of 2-adic integers @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "that is why the theory we develop finds numerous applications in computer science and cryptology : the straight - line programs ( and more complicated ones ) combined from the mentioned instructions can also be regarded as continuous 2-adic mappings ; so behaviour of these programs can be analysed by techniques of the non - archimedean dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing here that similar approaches work effectively also in genetics , cognitive sciences , image processing , quantum theory , etc .",

    "note that the first of these automata is word transitive while the second one is not .    with the use of theorem [ thm : comp - trans - der ] new types of absolutely transitive automata can be constructed as well .",

    "now note that the claim stated at the very beginning of the proof of theorem [ thm : comp - trans - der ] is just a re - statement of ( ii ) from definition [ def : auto - trans - e ] : indeed , under notation of definition [ def : auto - trans - e ] and the one from the beginning of the proof of theorem [ thm : comp - trans - der ] , the concatenation @xmath552 corresponds to @xmath2 , @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath397 , @xmath89 corresponds to @xmath188 , and @xmath24 is a @xmath312-letter suffix of the output word which is a base-@xmath29 expansion for @xmath553 , whereas @xmath57 is the length of the word @xmath96 . up to these correspondences , condition is equivalent to ( ii ) from definition [ def : auto - trans - e ] .",
