    "recently one of the major progresses in cold atom physics is the realization of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling for neutral atoms with the idea of light induced synthetic gauge fieldnist_nature , zhang_jing_fermion , mit_fermion , ustc_boson .",
    "previously , effects of spin - orbit coupling have only been studied in fermionic matters such as electron gases , while this progress opens up the new opportunity of studying so coupling in bosonic systems .",
    "this investment is interesting because so coupling changes many basic properties of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in both quantitative and qualitative way .",
    "although so coupling emerges at single particle level , it may have a significant effect to the many - body behavior due to the modification of the single particle density - of - state ( dos ) .",
    "one particular example is the rashba so coupled bose gases . because of the dramatic change of low energy dos , many intriguing many - body phenomena have been predicted there , and some questions still have not been thoroughly understood yet . while a number of theoretical works have studied its low - temperature properties , including ground state phases , quantum and thermal fluctuations , bose condensation transition and superfluiditiy zhai , victor , wu , gordom , cui , qi , biao_wu , the experimental realization of rashba so coupling remains to be a great challenge . on the other hand , the type of equal rashba and dresselhaus so coupling has been realized in current experiment with two photon raman transition . although the change of low - energy dos is not as dramatic as rashba case , such a so coupling leads to a non - monotonic behavior of low - energy dos as a function of raman strength , which should result in nontrivial manifestation of many - body properties .",
    "so far , a few papers have studied the ground state phase diagram , collective modes and response function for such so coupled condensate @xcite , but there are still several fundamental properties which have not been explored , in particular , the depletion of the condensate , the bec transition temperature and the superfluid critical velocities . in this work",
    "we report our theoretical studies of these properties .",
    "in current experiments , two counter - propagating raman beams are applied to couple two hyperfine levels of an alkali atom nist_nature , zhang_jing_fermion , mit_fermion , ustc_boson , which gives rise to the single - particle hamiltonian as @xcite ( set @xmath0 ) @xmath1where @xmath2 is the recoil momentum , @xmath3 is the raman coupling strength , and @xmath4 is the two - photon detunning . with pauli matrix , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "[ int ] , and the interaction energy @xmath32 becomes a function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "thus , a phase diagram can be constructed .",
    "more details have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we will just emphasize some general features .",
    "\\(1 ) if the energy minimization gives @xmath41 or @xmath42 , there is only one momentum component in the condensate wave function , and the density for both spin component are uniform , as it can be easily seen by setting @xmath41 or @xmath43 in eq .",

    "this is the plane wave `` condensate . while if the energy minimization gives @xmath44 , both @xmath45 and @xmath46 have spatially periodic modulation",

    "\\(2 ) because of so coupling , the densities of both components depend on momentum .",
    "if the interaction is @xmath47 invariant , i.e. @xmath48 , the interaction energy becomes @xmath49 . in this case , if the condensate is in the  plane wave \" phase , the interaction energy is independent of momentum , and one can take @xmath50 as @xmath51 which minimizes the single particle energy .",
    "however , because the two pseudo - spin states are taken as two hyperfine level of atoms , they do not have to obey @xmath52 spin rotational symmetry .",
    "thus , for a general case , three interaction parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are all unequal . therefore , even for the plane wave condensate , the interaction energy also depends on momentum @xmath56 .",
    "that is equivalent to say , even at mean - field level the self - energy correction has momentum dependence , which effectively modifies the single particle dispersion and changes the location of its minimum . in contrast , without so coupling , the mean - field self - energy correction is just a constant shift of single particle energy .",
    "thus , as first pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 is shifted away from single particle minimum @xmath51 .",
    "\\(3 ) the stripe phase has distinct properties from plane - wave phase . for the stripe phase",
    ", the total density will have spatial modulation , because the spin wave function at @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not orthogonal , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in this system the stripe phase is not favored by density interaction part @xmath60 . in another word ,",
    "if the interaction is @xmath52 invariant , stripe phase will not exist in this system .",
    "the difference in @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are necessary for stabilizing the stripe phase . moreover , since the non - uniform term in total density increases as @xmath61 increases .",
    "thus , the stripe phase , if exists , should be found in small @xmath62 regime of the phase diagram .",
    "\\(4 ) consider the limit @xmath63 , if @xmath64 , a homogeneous mixture of two components is stable against local density fluctuations , and there will be a mixed phase within certain detuning window .",
    "such a mixed phase will turn into stripe phase once @xmath61 becomes non - zero , for instance , for @xmath65rb case in fig .",
    "while if @xmath66 , the mixed phase is not stable against phase separation even for zero @xmath61 , and there will be no stripe phase in the phase diagram , for instance , for @xmath18na case in fig .",
    "hereafter , we should focus only on @xmath47 invariant interaction .",
    "this is relevant for experiment with rb or na , because the difference in @xmath67 , @xmath39 and @xmath68 are smaller than @xmath69 .",
    "the generalization to non-@xmath52 interaction is straightforward .",
    "besides , we only consider the plane wave phase , because in these systems , the stripe phase either occupies a very small regime of phase diagram or does not exist .     as a function of @xmath70 ; lower panel : dos as a function of @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",

    "the most intriguing point is at @xmath84 when the single particle dispersion behaves as @xmath85 at the lowest order and the low - energy dos reaches its maximum .",
    "as we shall see in later discussion , this has important physical consequences in the superfluid critical velocity and the bec transition temperature .",

    "this is because the phonon contribution , which dominates the quantum depletion , originates from states whose momenta are nearby condensate momentum and possess same magnetization as the condensate .",

    "critical dragging velocity is shown in fig .",
