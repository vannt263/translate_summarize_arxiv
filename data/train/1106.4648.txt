    "one of the most important factors determining properties of the transition metal ( tm ) oxides is the splitting of @xmath9-levels when the tm ions are put in a crystal .",
    "this crystal - field ( cf ) splitting largely determines magnetic and orbital state of respective ions , and thus their properties . in general",
    "there are two mechanisms , which have to be taken into account in the calculation of the cf splitting .",
    "one is the coulomb interaction of @xmath9-electrons with charges of surrounding ions - mainly nearest - neighbor anions like o@xmath10 in oxides or f@xmath11 and cl@xmath12 in fluorides and chlorides .",
    "since the coulomb repulsion with anions depends on the shape of the electron density , the resulting corrections to the energy spectrum will be different for different @xmath0orbitals .",
    "the second mechanism which also leads to the cf splitting is the covalency , the hybridization between @xmath0states of the tm ions and ligand @xmath8states .",
    "the @xmath7 hybridization ( hopping integrals @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) strongly depends on the symmetry of the local environment and will be very different for @xmath0orbitals pointing to the ligands ( @xmath5 orbitals in the case of a octahedral surrounding ) or looking in between of them ( @xmath6 orbitals in the octahedra ) , which would lead to their splitting . here and",
    "below we will discuss the octahedral symmetry .",
    "we show below that the role of these two mechanisms may strongly differ in conventional tm compounds and in the materials with the negative charge - transfer ( ct ) gaps  @xcite , with a ( e.g. oxygen ) holes in the ground state .",
    "the standard model describing transition metal ( tm ) ions in a crystal is @xmath14    here @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the creation and annihilation operators of @xmath0electrons at a site i in the orbital state @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 describe different @xmath8electrons at the @xmath21th ligand surrounding given tm site .",
    "the system is also characterized by the on - site coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction @xmath22 , and by the charge - transfer energy @xmath1 , defined as the energy of the transition @xmath23 which in the electron representation used in the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) is @xmath24 here we introduced the renormalized energy of @xmath0levels @xmath25 - the effective @xmath0energy levels to which an electron is transferred from @xmath8states of a ligand in the `` reaction ''  ( [ ct - reaction ] ) .",

    "[ posit - delta ] and [ neg - delta ] we have in mind these renormalized @xmath0levels  ( [ d - energy ] ) .    in principle one",
    "should include in this hamiltonian some other terms , such as the intra - atomic hund s rule exchange @xmath26 , coulomb repulsion for ligand @xmath8electrons @xmath27 , etc .",
    "for our purposes , however , the simplified model  ( [ ham ] ) is sufficient .",
    "in a most typical situation for the tm compounds , when the ligand @xmath8levels lie deep below @xmath0levels of the tm ions , both the coulomb and the hybridization contributions to the cf splitting lead to the same sequence of @xmath0levels . this case is characterized by a large positive ct gap @xmath1 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ ct - deter ] ) . as explained above and as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ posit - delta](a ) , the coulomb repulsion of @xmath9-electrons with negatively - charged ligands is stronger for @xmath29electrons with the lobes of the electron density directed towards the ligands than for @xmath30orbitals pointing in between the anions .",
    "this leads to the cf splitting shown in fig .",
    "[ posit - delta](c ) such that @xmath29orbitals lie _ above _ @xmath6 .",
    "this sequence of @xmath0levels is referred as `` normal '' .    the same `` normal '' sequence of @xmath0levels is also caused by the @xmath7 hybridization , i.e. by covalent contribution .",
    "since the hopping matrix elements @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are larger than hoppings between @xmath30orbitals and @xmath8orbitals of ligands ( @xmath33 ) , the @xmath29levels are pushed up stronger than @xmath6 , see figs .",

    "it was argued that an account of the real shape of ligand orbitals may change the sign of the coulomb contribution , obtained in the point - charge model .",
    "@xcite however , it was shown later that in order to consider ionic term in a correct way the @xmath0electron wave functions must be orthogonalized to the ligands .",
    "@xcite as a result , the total ionic contribution to the cf splitting has the same sign as the covalent term in the case of @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite    note that for the _ bonding _ levels ( the lower levels in fig .",
    "[ posit - delta](c ) ) the covalency contribution gives the sequence of levels opposite to the `` normal '' : the levels with the @xmath29symmetry have stronger bonding - antibonding splitting and lie _ below _ those with the @xmath30symmetry .",
    "but for large positive ct gap these states are predominantly made of the combination of @xmath8states of ligands with a proper symmetry , with only a small admixture of @xmath0states , and one rarely discuss these states , which lie deep below the fermi energy .",
    "all interesting phenomena take place in the partially - filled antibonding states , which have predominantly @xmath0character and which are responsible e.g. for magnetism , orbital ordering etc .",
    "but this changes drastically in case of the negative ct gap @xmath36 , which we now consider .",
    "the situation is quite different for the systems with small and especially negative ct gaps . in this case",
    "the coulomb and covalent contributions to the splitting of @xmath0_levels _ have different signs .",

    "@xcite on the language of energy levels a regime with the negative ct energy corresponds to the situation when the initial _ renormalized _",
    "@xmath0levels @xmath42 in  ( [ d - energy ] ) lie below the ligand @xmath8levels .",
    "we start with an analysis of the covalent contribution to the cf splitting , fig .",

    "in contrast to the case of @xmath43 it is now the lower bonding orbitals that have predominantly @xmath0character with a small admixture of @xmath8states @xmath44    for these bonding states the covalency leads to the splitting such that the @xmath30levels lie above @xmath29ones , i.e. this covalency contribution leads to an `` inverted '' cf splitting for @xmath0electrons .",
    "these bonding states are actually completely filled .",
    "the electrons of partially - filled levels will actually be in the antibonding orbitals @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath6 , opposite to the influence of the hybridization .",
    "one has to somewhat specify these arguments . in the case of @xmath36 the ground state",
    "should be better taken not as @xmath50 , but rather as @xmath51 , according to  ( [ ct - reaction ] ) .",
    "this will change the magnitude of the coulomb terms , the ting effect : still @xmath29electrons would repel stronger from the ligands ( with smaller charge , e.g. o@xmath52 instead of o@xmath10 ) .",
    "thus in the case of the negative ct gap the contributions of the coulomb interaction and of the @xmath7 covalency to the cf splitting of @xmath0states is opposite .",
    "the same can be said about the antibonding levels . as follows from eq .",

    "[ neg - delta](a ) , ( e.g. the @xmath18 combination @xmath53 $ ] , which hybridizes with @xmath54-orbital ) would have stronger attraction to a positively - charged @xmath0ion than the @xmath47orbitals , made out of the @xmath55combination of ligand orbitals . as a result",
    "the antibonding @xmath47levels due to this factor would lie higher than @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ neg - delta](b ) ) .",
    "thus we see that , in contrast to the `` normal '' case of positive ct gap , where both contributions to the cf splitting , the coulomb contribution and the covalency , lead to qualitatively the same order of levels ( antibonding @xmath5-levels are above @xmath6 , and vice versa for bonding states ) , for negative ct gaps the situation is different : these two contributions lead to the _ opposite _ level order .",
    "therefore by studying the actual order of these levels , experimentally or theoretically , one can get some information about which of these contributions is in fact stronger .",
    "we undertook such a study on the example of a system with the negative ct gap - cs@xmath3au@xmath3cl@xmath4 .",
    "cs@xmath3au@xmath3cl@xmath4 should formally contain the au@xmath57 ions .",

    "this also happens in this material : there occurs a spontaneous charge disproportionation ( cd ) into au@xmath58 ( au2 ) and au@xmath38 ( au1 ) , so that there appears in this compound two inequivalent au positions , with checkerboard ordering in a cubic perovskite lattice .",
    "@xcite , see fig .",

    "we used the pw - scf code with the ultrasoft version of pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "a maximum cut - off energy for the plane waves was chosen to be 200 ev . the brillouin - zone ( bz ) integration in the course of self - consistency interactions was performed over a mesh of 72 k - points .",

    "one may clearly see that indeed the lowest states in the valence band have largest contributions from the @xmath61 , not @xmath62 states , so that the ct energy is indeed negative in this compound .",
    "the states closest to the top of the valence band , as well as the states in the conduction band , are mainly of @xmath41-character .",
    "the total occupation of au2 @xmath63shell is 9.6 , which is close to the @xmath64 configuration , expected for au@xmath58 .",
    "however the number of @xmath9-electrons for au1 is 9.3 , much larger than 8 electrons expected from the naive ionic picture for the @xmath65 oxidation state of au .",
    "thus one should represent this states not as au@xmath38 ( @xmath66 ) , but rather as @xmath67 or even @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes ligand hole .",
    "this is due to the self - doping effect described above .",
    "au@xmath38 ions turned out to be jahn - teller active , but non - magnetic , with the configuration @xmath70 ( or rather @xmath71 ) .",
    "as it was shown in previous two sections , a larger hybridization leads to a larger bonding - antibonding splitting , independent on the sign of the @xmath1 .",
    "the cl octahedron surrounding au1 is elongated along @xmath72axis .",
    "then the bonding - antibonding splitting for the orbital of @xmath34-symmetry should be the largest among all of au @xmath63orbitals .",
    "this is exactly what we see in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ pdos ] . the coulomb contribution to the crystal - field splitting would stabilize just the opposite sequence of levels , see fig .",
    "[ neg - delta](b ) .",
    "this means that at least in this system the coulomb contribution to the total value of the cf splitting is much less than the covalent term .",
    "it is important to mention that the conduction band is basically formed by the @xmath18 combination of cl@xmath60 states with @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "these are actually the antibonding @xmath73 orbitals of the type ( 6 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ neg - delta](a ) .",
    "the charge density for this orbital , obtained using the wannier function projection technique , is shown in fig .",
    "[ x2y2-orbital ] .",
    "the detailed calculations show that about @xmath7420 % of the charge - density corresponding to this orbital has a @xmath63character , while the main part @xmath75 % comes from the cl@xmath60 orbitals .",
    "symmetry centered on au1 site , nominally @xmath76 .",
    "the central part corresponds to the contribution of the real au@xmath77 @xmath34 orbital , while the rest is a @xmath18 combination of the cl@xmath60 orbitals.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a similar analysis can be performed for the compressed along the @xmath78-axis au2o@xmath4 octahedra . here",
    "again the covalent contribution dominates and pushes down the bonding orbital of @xmath79-symmetry , which has the largest hybridization with the cl@xmath60 states .",
    "the question which naturally arises is how general is the conclusion reached above , that the covalency contribution to the cf splitting is ( much ) larger than the coulomb contribution .",
    "generally speaking , one could think that the covalency contribution to the @xmath80 splitting , which is @xmath81 could become small for very large @xmath82 .",
    "it is not surprising that this contribution dominates for systems with small or slightly negative ct gap ( apparently cs@xmath3au@xmath3cl@xmath4 belongs to this class ) .",
    "different approaches  @xcite , however , demonstrate that it is also the case for the values of parameters typical for `` normal '' tm compounds , such as knif@xmath59  @xcite or nio .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , one can not exclude that in some cases ( e.g. for the early 3d metals ) the situation could be different and the coulomb contribution would become comparable or larger than the covalency one .",
    "in this paper we analyzed possible features of the crystal field splitting in different situations , and argued that for the negative charge - transfer gaps , in contrast to the `` normal '' situation with @xmath28 , different contributions to the crystal field splitting , the coulomb contribution and that of the covalency with the ligands , act in opposite direction : the coulomb contribution always pushes the @xmath6 levels below the @xmath5 ones , whereas the @xmath7 hybridization would lead to the opposite order of the bonding levels ( which for negative charge transfer gap have predominantly @xmath0character ) .",
    "the study of a concrete example of cs@xmath3au@xmath3cl@xmath4 demonstrates that this system indeed has negative charge - transfer gap , so that the states in the conduction band are largely made of @xmath8states of cl .",
    "the bonding states of @xmath0character lie @xmath742 - 6 ev below the fermi energy , and in this region the @xmath5 levels lie below @xmath6 ones .",
    "thus in this particular system the @xmath7 hybridization dominates and determines the sequence of levels .",
    "we discuss in conclusion whether the opposite situation could be possible , in which case the sequence of @xmath0levels would be determined by the coulomb contribution and might be different from the usual one .",
