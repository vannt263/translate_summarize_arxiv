    "( b ) @xmath0 : time - dependent bnard  von krmn vortex street @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    recent experimental @xcite , numerical @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite have highlighted similarities between turbulence in quantum fluids ( e.g. superfluid helium and atomic bose - einstein condensates ) and turbulence in ordinary ( classical ) fluids @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is found that , in the idealized case of homogeneous isotropic conditions away from boundaries , the distribution of kinetic energy over the length scales obeys the celebrated kolmogorov scaling of classical turbulence @xcite .",
    "this similarity is remarkable , because a superfluid has zero viscosity and vorticity is not a continuous field but is concentrated in discrete vortex filaments of fixed circulation @xmath1 proportional to planck s constant . in the more realistic presence of boundaries ( such as an obstacle or confining channel walls ) , superfluid hydrodynamics",
    "is less understood , despite the large number of experiments in such scenarios .    in a classical viscous fluid @xcite ,",
    "the prototype problem with a boundary is the flow around a cylinder or a sphere ( or , changing the frame of reference , the motion of a cylinder or a sphere in a fluid at rest ) .",
    "the nature of such flow is determined by the reynolds number @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ( assumed uniform ) flow s velocity away from the obstacle , @xmath4 is the obstacle s size , and @xmath5 is the fluid s kinematic viscosity . if @xmath6 , a steady symmetric wake forms behind the obstacle ; if @xmath7 the wake becomes asymmetric and time dependent , forming the famous bnard  von krmn vortex street structure .",
    "these cases are depicted in figure [ fig : taneda - imgs ] . at",
    "even higher @xmath8 , the flow becomes turbulent .",
    "what happens in a superfluid is not clear .",
    "firstly , the superfluid has zero viscosity ( @xmath9 ) and hence @xmath8 can not be defined .",
    "secondly , experiments performed in superfluid helium confirm that the flow is affected by the boundaries @xcite ; unfortunately what is observed is not the flow pattern itself , but rather the trajectories of tracer particles , whose relation with the flow is still the subject of investigations @xcite",
    ". numerical simulations of three - dimensional ( 3d ) superfluid flow around an oscillating sphere performed using the vortex filament model were not conclusive - quantum vortices did not appear to organise themselves into a visible classical  like wake near the obstacle @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) scenario of an obstacle moving through a superfluid offers a simplified platform to consolidate analogs and disparities between classical and quantum fluids . in their pioneering simulations of the 2d nonlinear schrdinger equation ,",
    "frisch and pomeau @xcite observed the formation of vortex pairs in the flow past a circular obstacle .",
    "a more complete picture has been revealed by sasaki _",
    "_ @xcite . below a critical velocity ( which depends on the strength @xcite and shape of the external potential ) , the fluid undergoes laminar flow around the obstacle . above this",
    "critical velocity vortices become nucleated and peel off from the moving obstacle .",
    "two patterns are possible , depending on the size of the obstacle : vortex - antivortex pairs in either a symmetric @xcite or asymmetric configuration ( with the preference for the latter ) ; or alternating pairs of like - signed vortices , forming a trail analogous to the bernrd - von krmn vortex street . at higher velocities ,",
    "vortex nucleation becomes highly irregular .",
    "recent studies of this 2d system have considered vortex emission and drag @xcite , the critical velocity @xcite , the effect of inhomogeneous potentials @xcite , the role on the obstacle parameters @xcite , and supersonic effects such as oblique dark solitons @xcite and cerenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "et al.__@xcite have shown that , within stirred annular trapping potentials , macroscopic rotation forms due to spatial clustering of vortices .    in this work",
    "we present the first clear evidence of a classical wake in superfluid flow past an obstacle . using the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a zero - temperature bose - einstein condensate and an elliptical obstacle ,",
    "we show that the interaction of discrete vortex singularities downstream of the obstacle yields a flow pattern which indeed mimics classical vortex flow .",
    "we consider an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) moving relative to a laser - induced obstacle ( imposed through an external potential ) , as realized experimentally in 3d @xcite and quasi-2d condensates @xcite .",
    "this scenario closely resembles that of the classical wake - problem @xcite . on a much larger scale , a similar 3d configuration has been experimentally realized in liquid helium @xcite .",
    "the bec , assumed to be weakly - interacting and at ultracold temperature , is parameterized by its mean - field wavefunction @xmath10 , which defines the fluid number density @xmath11 .",
    "the wavefunction satisfies the non - linear schrdinger equation , also known as the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , where a cubic nonlinearity arises from the mean - field potential generated by the dominant _ s_-wave ( contact ) atom - atom interactions .",
    "the equation is , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the interaction coefficient , with @xmath14 being the atomic _ s_-wave scattering length and @xmath15 the atomic mass , and @xmath16 is the chemical potential of the condensate . the gpe is solved in the reference frame moving with the obstacle , at speed @xmath3 along @xmath17 .",
    "the external potential acting on the system @xmath18 is taken to be zero everywhere , i.e. a homogeneous system with uniform density @xmath19 , apart from a localized repulsive potential , gaussian in shape , which represents the obstacle .",
    "a key feature of this work is that the obstacle is taken to be elliptical , of ellipticity @xmath20 , with the short axis being parallel to the flow , @xmath17 .",
    "such a potential , in its 2d form , can be generated via the repulsive optical dipole force from an incident blue - detuned laser beam which is moved relative to the condensate either by deflection of the beam @xcite or motion of the condensate itself when offset in a harmonic trap @xcite .",

    "we begin by exploring quantum wakes in the 2d flow of a bec past an obstacle , according to the 2d gpe with the elliptical potential defined in equation ( [ eq : potential2d ] ) .      for illustrative purposes we first consider an elliptical obstacle ( size @xmath33 , ellipticity @xmath34 ) moving at speed @xmath26 .",

    "we examine the role of ellipticity in more detail in sections [ sec : crit_vel ] and [ sec : ellipt ] .    at later times",
    "[ figure [ fig : denstraj](a)(ii ) ] , the flow becomes asymmetric due to the known instability of symmetric wakes @xcite .",
    "a striking pattern emerges whereby distinct clusters of co - rotating vortices ( of the order of 5 vortices in each cluster ) develop downstream of the obstacle .",
    "each cluster contains vortices of the same sign and adjacent clusters have alternating sign .",
    "these clusters form a bnard ",
    "von krmn vortex street downstream from the obstacle , confirming the intuition that a sufficiently large number of quanta of circulation reproduce classical physics . here",
    ", the ellipticity of the obstacle facilitates the formation of this street ; the relatively high rate of vortex emission leads to a greater interaction between vortices in the wake which in turn promotes clustering .",
    "in contrast , for a circular obstacle the symmetric wake evolves into a v - shaped wake of vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite ; this because the vortex emisson rate and hence their subsequent interaction is insufficient to induce significant clustering .",
    "the vortex trajectories provide visualisation of the time - integrated nature of the wake [ figure [ fig : denstraj](b ) ] . at early times ( i )",
    ", we see that the vortex trajectories are symmetric , forming a flow pattern in striking analog to the classical wake at low @xmath29 .",
    "the generic development of vortex trajectories is as follows .",
    "pairs of singly - quantized vortices of opposite sign peel off from the poles of the obstacle and interact with each other as vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "each pair propagates in the positive @xmath17 direction with approximate velocity @xmath35@xcite , where @xmath36 is the pair separation @xcite ; the pair s velocity is less than the obstacle s velocity and it drifts behind the obstacle . as the pair moves further away from the obstacle , its separation decreases and its velocity increases , such that it begins to catch the obstacle up .",
    "once the pair is sufficiently close to the obstacle , it again separates and slows down , then the cycle repeats . as more vortices are nucleated , two distinct clusters of like - circulation form .",
    "nucleated pairs then travel around the outside of the existing cluster before contracting , speeding up and travelling through the middle of the clusters towards the obstacle .",
    "the clusters grow until they reach a maximum size depending on the obstacle s size and speed . hereafter , nucleated vortex pairs travel around the outside of the two clusters and continue travelling downstream , becoming lost from the main wake .",

    "like - signed vortices are known to co - rotate , these vortices group into clusters which slowly rotate .",
    "this cluster effects the velocity field once more , causing a cluster of opposite signed vortices to be produced .",

    "<S> we show that an elliptical obstacle moving through a bose - einstein condensate generates wakes of quantum vortices which resemble those of classical viscous flow past a cylinder or sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the role of ellipticity is to facilitate the interaction of the vortices nucleated by the obstacle . </S>",
    "<S> initial steady symmetric wakes lose their symmetry and form clusters of like - signed vortices , in analogy to the classical bnard  von krmn vortex street . our findings , demonstrated numerically in both two and three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> confirm the intuition that a sufficiently large number of quanta of circulation reproduce classical physics . </S>"
