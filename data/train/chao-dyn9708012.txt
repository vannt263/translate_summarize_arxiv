    "in 1963 lorenz@xcite reduced the equations for convective fluid flow into three first order coupled nonlinear differential equations and demonstrated with these the idea of sensitive dependence upon initial conditions and chaos .",
    "it was shown by haken in 1975 that these equations are isomorphic with the maxwell bloch laser equations for a homogeneously broadened single mode travelling wave resonantly tuned laser in which the modes are presumed plane waves and the pumping is presumed uniform@xcite .",
    "even though these equations are isomorphic their conventional layout is different , as shown in equations [ eq : lorenz1]-[eq : lorenz2 ] and [ eq : haken1]-[eq : haken2 ] .",

    "the parameters are related via @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the relaxation rate of the inversion , @xmath13 is the relaxation rate of the polarization,@xmath14 is the field relaxation rate , and @xmath15 represents the pump power , normalized to the threshold for cw lasing .",
    "it was conjectured that lorenz - like chaotic behaviour could exist in an optically pumped far infrared ring laser . subsequently ,",
    "such chaos , characterised by variable length trains of pulses of increasing amplitude ( `` spirals '' ) was observed by weiss and coworkers in @xmath16 lasers , under appropriate conditions@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will not discuss the other sorts of chaos exhibited by the laser while it is under other conditions .",
    "detailed study has since shown that there are only a few minor differences between the laser s lorenz - like chaos and lorenz haken chaos@xcite .",
    "one of the most obvious differences is the appearance of an anomalously large peak nearly always observed at the start of every spiral in the laser@xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to deviations from the simple model due to doppler broadening or coherent pumping effects on the pump transition@xcite .",
    "it was also found that this effect appears if the theory simply accounts for the fact that the laser and the pump have transverse structures ( i.e. there exist real modes in the cavity ) and are not plane wave as the lorenz haken equations assume@xcite . perhaps it is a generic effect of any small deviation from the lorenz equations .",
    "the other obvious difference in the behaviour of the laser is that under nearly all circumstances the laser pulses periodically below chaos threshold and does not make a direct transition from the steady state to chaos as the lorenz haken equations predict .",
    "although topological arguments suggest that in any continuous transition from a fixed point to a strange attractor the attractor should become one - dimensional , corresponding to a periodic orbit , at some point , the transition to chaos in the lorenz equations is a global bifurcation with no intermediate states .",
    "further , the model accounting for nonuniformity of pump and electric field also shows a transition with no intermediate periodic state .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe the route to lorenz like chaos in an optically pumped far infrared ammonia laser and suggest the possible nature of the bifurcations and hence the underlying topology of the laser attractor as the pump power is increased from the lasing threshold to chaos",
    ".    the next section will give a short revision of the route to chaos with increasing pump power for the lorenz haken equations to allow easy comparison with the route to chaos observed in the laser , which will be described in section [ route in laser ] .",
    "in section [ detuning ] the results of section [ route in laser ] will be extended to include the effect of detuning in the laser .",
    "the lorenz equations have been studied extensively over the years as a basic illustrator of chaos and demonstration platform for various theories relating to chaos .",
    "an extensive review of lorenz chaos was undertaken by sparrow@xcite , who subsequently showed numerically that there is considerable complexity in the dynamics of the lorenz equations which was not previously analytically explained .",
    "this included such phenomena as homoclinic explosions which give rise to stable periodic motion , and a heteroclinic bifurcation .    to explain how the route to chaos in the laser differs from that of the equations a brief revision of the bifurcations in the equations will be given .",
    "below lasing threshold the origin is globally attracting .",
    "that is , all trajectories finish at the origin if @xmath17 . at @xmath18 a simple",
    "bifurcation occurs which creates two stationary points at @xmath19 henceforth called @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at this bifurcation",
    "the origin loses its stability , however @xmath20 and @xmath21 are stable .",
    "the two points represent the steady state solutions for the system in the two possible orientations that they might find themselves , with the elctric field and polarization differing by a @xmath22 phase shift . at @xmath23",
    "the equations go through a second bifurcation in which the points @xmath20 and @xmath21 lose their stability .",
    "the bifurcation is of the type known as a hopf bifurcation , which may occur in two ways .",
    "the bifurcation is `` supercritical '' if each point loses its stability by expelling a stable periodic orbit .",
    "it is `` subcritical '' if they lose their stability by absorbing an unstable periodic orbit . for values of @xmath15 greater than the hopf bifurcation point",
    "the origin and both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are all unstable .",
    "there is another point on the route to chaos which delineates an important event and this is the occurence of a homoclinic orbit .",
    "the homoclinic orbit separates the region between normal stable behaviour and possible metastable chaos , associated with an unstable periodic orbit .",
    "this can be understood by considering operation just above lasing threshold .",
    "a trajectory started very near to the origin will move out and , as shown in figure 1 , quickly spiral into either @xmath20 or @xmath21 depending on which the point started closer to .",
    "as @xmath15 is increased the trajectories around the @xmath24 widen until the trajectory in both the forward and backward propagation of time moves towards the origin .",
    "there is therefore a homoclinic orbit associated with the origin . if @xmath15 is increased slightly further the trajectory jumps across to spiral into the opposite stable point .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this point and sparrow@xcite gives a more detailed explanation of how this occurs .",
    "increasing @xmath15 above the homoclinic explosion , as shown by sparrow , the homoclinic orbit becomes an unstable periodic orbit , getting smaller and finally getting absorbed by the stable point @xmath20 or @xmath21 at the hopf bifurcation .",
    "the implications of the existence of these orbits is best described by figure 2 where the bifurcations are placed into context with each other .",
    "when the unstable periodic orbits decrease in size there is a possibilty for the trajectory to oscillate between the two sides of the attractor and do so for long periods of time .",
    "however because there are two stable attractors embedded in an unstable attractor the trajectory must finally intersect the stable manifolds and spiral into the stable points @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "so instead of the infinitely long single trajectory as experienced in chaos there are an infinite number of finite length trajectories .",
    "this is generally called `` preturbulence '' or `` metastable chaos '' and refers to the fact that the dynamics may look chaotic , but will at some finite time intersect the stable manifold and spiral toward one of the stable points .",
    "the experimental setup we use has been fully described by tin win et al@xcite . briefly , it is a @xmath0 far infrared ring laser which is pumped by a @xmath25 laser whose pump output is attenuated by an acousto optic modulator ( aom ) of rise time 0.8 @xmath26 . to gain more insight into the attractor properties ,",
    "the laser was switched from above chaos threshold to below chaos threshold periodically by the aom .",
    "each period above chaos was about 50 - 100 chaotic pulses long , whereas the period below chaos threshold was generally about 100 - 150 pulses in length .",
    "the time between pulses is about 0.8 @xmath26 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the time series of the lorenz haken equations as a result of such a sudden decrease in @xmath15 from just above chaos threshold to below chaos threshold .",
    "the transition to the new state involves two phases .",
    "firstly there is a variable length period of chaotic pulsations , followed by a damped oscillation .",
    "theoretical studies of this behaviour@xcite have shown that the length of the chaotic phase can be characterised by an exponential distribution with a mean length dependent on how far below chaos threshold the pump power is .",
    "a detailed experimental study of this behaviour is being undertaken with the results to be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows a typical time series for the @xmath0 far infrared laser , demonstrating the predicted behaviour .",
    "it should be noted that the only variable which is measurable in the laser is the intensity .",
    "this of course places some restrictions on the information which is processable from any time series obtained .",
    "comparison of return maps and statistical analysis@xcite have shown that the chaos exhibited by the laser , for specific parameters is very similar to lorenz chaos . because the chaos is lorenz - like",
    "it can be assumed that the dynamics above chaos threshold must have a topologically similar structure to the lorenz haken equations . at the other extreme , tin win",
    "et al@xcite determined the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the @xmath0 laser by comparing the decay envelopes for transients for low pump power with the linearised lorenz haken equations .",
    "these studies showed that the laser operates in reasonably close agreement with the lorenz haken equations for low pump powers .",
    "figure 3 and figure 4 compare the dynamics of the experiment with what is expected from the equations . in the parameter range where the dynamics of the laser exhibits preturbulence its behaviour also seems to be very similar to the lorenz haken equations@xcite . in the lorenz haken equations , close to but above",
    "the homoclinic explosion a trajectory started in the vicinity of the origin should go around one of the points @xmath24 once and then spiral into the other point .",
    "it is normally possible to measure only the intensity in these experiments which obviously makes it difficult to observe a jump from one side of the attractor to the other .",
    "one way to detect a jump is to measure the phase of the laser radiation by heterodyne detection .",
    "we have carried out this experiment using a second @xmath0 laser ( a standing wave laser operated continuously with a few milliwatts of output power ) as a local oscillator and a schottky barrier detector as mixer with the two beams combined at a polyethylene beamsplitter .",
    "the output from the detector contains a homodyne spectrum from the ring laser , extending out several megahertz , and the heterodyne spectrum centred on the mean frequency difference between the two lasers which was limited to about 6 @xmath27 .",
    "the detector signal was digitised , the homodyne spectrum removed numerically and quadrature field components ( or amplitude and phase ) reconstructed by numerically mixing with a signal at the mean difference frequency , in analogy with rf engineering methods .",
    "appendix a has a thorough explanation of the method used to extract the amplitude and phase of the signal .",
    "this method is similar to that used by tang et al@xcite , but handles transients better .",
    "examples of the results are shown in figures 5 and 6 . in both cases the laser pump power was rapidly switched on from zero to a level giving cw output , and the transient approach to the steady state was recorded .",
    "figure 5 shows the intensity and phase variation at low pump powers with an apparent slow drift in phase ( a result of a drift in local oscillator frequency relative to the ring laser ) but no jump in phase .",
    "figure 6 , however shows the intensity and phase variation with the pump power above the first homoclinic explosion , with a @xmath28 phase jump clearly present between the first and second pulses .",
    "the only difference between the laser and the equations is the occurence of a stable oscillation within the preturbulent regime in the laser . instead of finally decaying to a steady value corresponding to a fixed point",
    ", the decay is to a stable oscillation .",
    "this oscillation is also met if the pump power is raised slowly in a quasi - static manner , with a threshold somewhat below the chaos threshold .",
    "the oscillation starts small at lower pump powers and grows with increasing pump power until the laser shows no more preturbulence .",
    "when the stable oscillation grows to be about the same size as the preturbulence , the laser jumps into chaos and stays there .",
    "figure 7 shows a typical graph of percentage pump power below chaos threshold and oscillation amplitude for a particular set of parameters .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of such behaviour .",
    "when this is compared with the time series of figure 3 it is obvious that this does not occur in the lorenz haken equations .    to revise what happens as the pump power",
    "is increased ;    \\1 . for pump powers",
    "below 120 @xmath29 at a pressure of 38 @xmath30 there is no lasing    \\2 . for powers greater than this",
    "the laser makes a transient oscillation which damps to steady state much like the lorenz haken equations , moving towards one or other of the stable fixed points ( figure 5 ) .",
    "a point started near the origin and close to lorenz - like chaos will exhibit a jump from one side of the attractor to the other and subsequently collapse into steady state lasing ( figure 6 ) .",
    "\\4 . for slightly higher pump powers",
    "the laser exhibits preturbulence much like that of the lorenz haken equations .",
    "the differences between them lies in the appearance of a stable oscillation in the laser which grows in amplitude as the pump power increases ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "so far the dynamics of the lorenz haken equations and the dynamics of the laser have been described to explain their respective routes to chaos as the pump power is increased .",
    "both routes look quite similar except for the appearance of the stable oscillation in the laser .",
    "a possible explanation for the occurrence of such a stable oscillation is shown in figure 8 . starting at low pump power the first significant event , as pump power is increased , is the appearance of the two unstable periodic orbits around the stable points @xmath24 as is the case with the lorenz haken equations . increasing the pump power further the points @xmath24 bifurcate in a supercritical hopf bifurcation , each expelling a stable periodic orbit and becoming unstable .",
    "a representative diagram showing all the orbits for a specific pump power is shown in figure 9 . increasing the pump power from here on results in an increasing size of the stable homoclinic orbits .",
    "chaos is reached when the unstable and stable homoclinic orbits annihilate each other to leave lorenz like chaos .",
    "the most trivial implication of this route to chaos is that the points @xmath24 go unstable at lower pump powers than they do in the lorenz haken equations .",
    "this also has the implication that the range of pump powers over which preturbulence exists may be reduced .",
    "during the course of the experiment it was observed that the amplitude of the stable oscillations during preturbulent chaos is dependent upon detuning of the laser cavity .",
    "it was found that within an extremely small range of detuning , preturbulence occurred with the laser relaxing down to steady state rather than the stable oscillations .",
    "this range was far narrower than the range over which lorenz like chaos was observed , and so narrow that it was not possible to carry out an exhaustive investigation . however , figure 10 shows an intensity time series of such an event . at the moment",
    "it is not possible with our setup to measure how far from zero detuning the laser is , no conclusions can therefore be made as to where this region resides",
    ". it would not be surprising however to find this region at zero detuning .",
    "this would therefore mean that there does exist a regime where the laser chaos corresponds exactly to the lorenz laser case described by the lorenz haken equations .",
    "such a regime has also been observed in the @xmath31 laser@xcite .",
    "it has been shown , based on measurements of the transient behaviour of the laser , that the @xmath0 far infrared laser has a route to chaos with increasing pump power which is slightly different from that of the lorenz haken equations . as with any other laser it has a minimum pump power below which no lasing is possible . for powers greater than this",
    "the laser makes a transient oscillation which damps to steady state much like the lorenz haken equations .",
    "using heterodyne techniques to see the field there was found to be a pump power above which the laser exhibits a jump from one side of the attractor to the other where the field subsequently collapsed to steady state lasing . at slightly higher pump powers",
    "the laser was found to exhibit preturbulence leading to a stable oscillation which grows in amplitude with increasing pump power . finally , above a certain power lorenz like chaos",
    "is observed .",
    "the route to chaos , as observed in our laser , has been conjectured to involve an extra stable periodic orbit which annihilates with the unstable periodic orbit to leave lorenz like chaos .",
    "it was also shown that for an extremely small range of detunings the laser will show preturbulence without the occurence of the stable oscillations .",
    "these phenomena will provide an excellent test for improved theoretical models of the laser .",
    "in the heterodyne measurement of the chaotic laser , the signal from the chaotic laser and the signal from the local oscillator are coupled together by a beam splitter .",
    "the mixed signals are then detected by a schottky barrier diode .",
    "the electric field of the chaotic laser and the local oscillator are : @xmath32 \\\\ e_{2}(t ) & = & a_{2}\\sin(\\omega_{2 } t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the amplitude , the  optical \" frequency and the phase of the electrical field of the ring laser respectively . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the amplitude and the  optical \" frequency of the local oscillator respectively . @xmath33 and @xmath35 are time dependent .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath37 are constant .",
    "the response of the schottky diode is  @xcite @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants .    because the rest of the electronics responds only to frequencies much lower than the  optical \" frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath37 , and a bias voltage is applied to the schottky diode to make it favor the square term , in the output from the schottky detector only the square term is important .",
    "so for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the response time of the schottky diode ) the output from the schottky diode is @xmath43}_{heterodyne\\ : part}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the output from the schottky diode is a mixture of the desired heterodyne signal carried by the beat between the chaotic laser and the local oscillator with an unwanted homodyne component .",
    "the time variation of @xmath33 and @xmath35 lead to a finite width for both the homodyne and heterodyne spectra in the frequency domain .",
    "it was ensured that the spectra did not overlap so that the homodyne and heterodyne signals could be separated by using simple filters .",
    "if they overlapped a more complicated detection setup , for instance using two schottky diodes to detect the homodyne signal and the mixed signal respectively , would be necessary .    in the heterodyne signal , @xmath33 and @xmath35",
    "are carried by the beat between the chaotic laser and the local oscillator .",
    "the carrier signal must be removed from the heterodyne signal in order to reconstruct the chaotic laser field . a fast fourier transformation ( fft )",
    "was applied to the experimental record to obtain the signal spectrum and determine the cutoff frequencies for a low and high frequency filter .",
    "these filters were subsequently used on the original experimental record to separate the homodyne and heterodyne signals .",
    "the homodyne signal was constructed directly from the low pass filtered portion of the signal .",
    "the heterodyne time series was separately mixed with a sinusoidal and a cosinusoidal signal of the beat frequency and low pass filtered in order to reconstruct the two orthogonal components of the heterodyne time series and hence the field components and phase .",
    "tests on synthetic data show this method is reliable for in analyzing transient signals , as it is able to reconstruct the original field amplitude and phase perfectly .",
    "by contrast , the signal processing method used by tang et al@xcite , which is based on maniopulation of fourier transforms , is able to reconstruct periodic data reasonably well , but it introduces errors in the amplitude and the phase when the signals are transient .",
