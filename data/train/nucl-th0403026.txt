    "<S> it is generally expected that the cooling processes via neutrino emission  @xcite , the properties of rotating dynamics , the post - glitch timing observations  @xcite , the possible vertex pinning  @xcite of a neutron star are rather sensitive to the presence of neutron and proton superfluid phases as well as to their pairing strength . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , since the paired nucleons do not contribute to thermal excitations , the proton superfluidity could suppress considerably the neutrino emission processes , and consequently affects the neutrino cooling rate of a neutron star remarkably .    </S>",
    "<S> since the neutron and proton superfluidity properties in neutron stars are related only indirectly to the observations , reliable and precise theoretical predictions based on microscopic many - body approaches are highly desirable . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is reported by using the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculations based on purely two - body nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath10 ) interactions that the @xmath0 neutron superfluid can be formed only in the low - density region ( @xmath11 ) with a maximal gap value of about @xmath12mev at a fermi momentum @xmath13@xmath14 , while due to the small proton fraction in @xmath1-stable matter the proton superfluid phase in the @xmath0 channel may extend to much higher baryon densities up to @xmath15@xmath16 with a maximal pairing gap of about 0.9mev . in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> it was found that the relativistic effect on the proton superfluidity in the @xmath0 channel is very weak , while the magnitude of the neutron pairing gap in the @xmath17 channel is reduced strongly due to relativistic corrections to the single - particle ( s.p .  ) </S>",

    "<S> the pairing correlations in nuclear medium are essentially related to the underlying @xmath10 interaction and their magnitude is determined by the competition between the repulsive short - range and attractive long - range parts of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the gap equation is extremely sensitive to the medium modifications of both the bare @xmath10 interaction and the s.p . energy . </S>",
    "<S> these medium effects on nuclear pairing are extremely difficult to study on a microscopic level and have motivated an extensive investigation by many authors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three - body forces , which turn out to be crucial for reproducing the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter in a non - relativistic microscopic approach  @xcite , are expected to modify strongly the in - vacuum @xmath10 interaction , especially the short - range part  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , their effects on the superfluidity properties in neutron stars have not yet been well investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is devoted to the influence of three - body forces on the @xmath0 neutron and proton superfluid phases in @xmath1-stable matter .    </S>",
    "<S> for such a purpose , we shall not go beyond the bcs framework . in this case , the pairing gap which characterizes the superfluidity in a homogeneous fermi system is determined by the standard bcs gap equation  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bare @xmath10 interaction in momentum space , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the s.p . </S>",

    "<S> the tbf is constructed self - consistently with the @xmath23 two - body force by using the meson - exchange current approach  @xcite and it contents the contributions from different intermediate virtual processes such as virtual nucleon - antinucleon pair excitations , and nucleon resonances ( for details , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tbf effects on the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter and its connection to the relativistic effects in the dbhf approach have been reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the tbf on landau parameters in nuclear matter and on the neutrino mean free path in neutron stars has also been explored  @xcite .    the proton fraction and the s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energies in @xmath1-stable matter are calculated by using the bhf approach for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite . in solving the bethe - goldstone equation for the @xmath24-matrix , the continuous choice  @xcite for the auxiliary potential </S>",
    "<S> is adopted since it provides a much faster convergence of the hole - line expansion than the gap choice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the tbf is included in the self - consistent brueckner procedure along the same lines as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where an effective two - body interaction is constructed to avoid the difficulty of solving the full three - body problem . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description and justification of the method are discussed in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> we simply write down the equivalent two - body potential in @xmath25-space @xmath26 @xmath27 where the trace is taken with respect to the spin and isospin of the third nucleon , and @xmath28 is the defect function . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e : tbf ] ) the effective two - body force is obtained by averaging the three - body force over the wave function of the third nucleon taking into account the correlations between this nucleon and the two others . due to its dependence on the defect function the effective two - body force </S>",

    "<S> inclusion of the tbf in the calculations increases the proton fractions at high densities . </S>",

    "<S> for comparison , the dotted and dot - dashed curves are the energy gaps reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the argonne @xmath37 and the paris potentials , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the results calculated with the three different two - body interactions agree well with each other , i.e. , the neutron superfluidity phase in the @xmath0 channel can only occur in the low - density region ( @xmath38@xmath16 ) of neutron stars with a maximal gap value of about 2.8mev peaked at a fermi momentum @xmath13@xmath14 ( the corresponding total baryon density is @xmath39@xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tbf effect is quiet small , i.e. , almost negligible at relatively low density and a slight suppression of the gap as increasing density . </S>",
    "<S> this result is expected from the low density for the @xmath0 neutron superfluidity , since three - body forces are invented to take , in an effective way , the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclear medium into account and become significant only at high densities , i.e. , around and above the empirical saturation density  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : protongap ] is reported the proton @xmath0 energy gap in @xmath1-stable matter . </S>",

    "<S> our result is in good agreement with the predictions by adopting the bonn potential  @xcite , the @xmath37 and the paris potentials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as compared to the neutron @xmath0 superfluidity , the proton @xmath0 superfluid phase extends to much higher densities but with a smaller peak gap value around @xmath40@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is a direct consequence of the small proton fraction in @xmath1-stable matter , and the latter stems from the different s.p . </S>",

    "<S> potential is much deeper than the neutron one  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the tbf are twofold as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : protongap ] . </S>",
    "<S> one is a strong reduction of the peak value of the gap from @xmath41mev to @xmath42mev and a remarkable shift of the peak to a much lower baryon density from @xmath43 @xmath16 to @xmath44@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the another is that the tbf leads to a noticeable shrinking of the density region of the superfluid phase from @xmath45@xmath16 to @xmath46@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the above predicted tbf suppression of the @xmath0 proton superfluidity in @xmath1-stable matter appears inconsistent with the small proton fractions which correspond to small proton densities in the matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , since proton pairs are embedded in the medium of neutrons and protons , both the surrounding protons and neutrons contribute to the tbf renormalization of the proton - proton interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the relevant density to the tbf effect is the total baryon density , but not the proton one . </S>",
    "<S> one can verify from fig .  2 that the strongest suppression of the energy gap is mainly in the region @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the empirical saturation density of nuclear matter , and the reduction of the gap increases rapidly as increasing the total baryon density .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing the discrepancy between the tbf effect and the relativistic effect  @xcite on the @xmath0 proton superfluidity in @xmath1-stable matter . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that the relativistic effect reduces remarkably the @xmath17 neutron gap , but the differences between the relativistic and nonrelativistic proton gaps in the @xmath0 channel are quite small . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason concerns the more or less different mechanisms involved . in the dbhf approach  @xcite , the medium renormalization of the bare @xmath10 interaction are taken into account via the dirac spinor which is dressed in nuclear medium ( which can be traced to the virtual excitation of nucleon - antinucleon pairs  @xcite ) , but the most important effect on the pairing gaps ( for instance , the @xmath17 neutron gap ) comes from the relativistic modification of the s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the tbf is expected to influence the superfluidity phases in @xmath1-stable matter via three different ways . </S>",
    "<S> first it renormalizes the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> second it modifies the s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energy spectrum in the gap equation and finally the inclusion of the tbf changes the predicted proton fractions as shown in tab .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> to see which is the most important mechanism responsible for the strong suppression of the @xmath0 proton energy gaps , we include the tbf in the bhf calculations to obtain the proton fractions and s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energies , but adopt only the pure @xmath23 as the @xmath10 interaction @xmath19 in the gap equation , i.e. , eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown by the dotted curve in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the combined effects via the proton fractions and the s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energies are relatively small , i.e. , a slight reduction , and mainly in the higher density region ( @xmath49@xmath16 ) where the tbf modifications of the proton fractions ( tab.1 ) and the proton s.p . energies  @xcite become appreciably larger . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the strongest effect stems from the tbf renormalization of the @xmath10 interaction in the medium .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the influence of the tbf on the neutron and proton pairing gaps in the @xmath0 channel in @xmath1-stable neutron star matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the tbf has only a weak effect on the neutron @xmath0 superfluidity phase , i.e. , a slight reduction of the energy gap , due to the low - density region concerned . </S>",
    "<S> however it suppresses strongly the proton superfluidity in the @xmath0 channel induced by the two - body @xmath10 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the peak value of the proton @xmath0 energy gap is reduced by about 50% from @xmath50 0.95mev to @xmath50 0.55mev and shifted to a much lower density by the inclusion of the tbf . </S>",
    "<S> the density region for the superfluid phase is also remarkably shrunken as compared to the pure two - body force prediction . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this suppression is mainly related to the tbf renormalization of the @xmath0 two - body interaction .    besides the tbf effects , the medium renormalizations of the @xmath10 interaction and the s.p . </S>",
    "<S> energies , i.e. , the screening effects such as the polarization effects and dispersive effects , may also influence largely the superfluidity properties in nuclear medium . up to now , all investigations in the literature@xcite have predicted a reduction of the bcs superfluidity gap in the @xmath0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect that the screening effects may further suppress the @xmath0 proton superfluidity in @xmath1-stable matter .    </S>",
    "<S> since the relativistic effects lead to a strong suppression of the @xmath17 neutron superfluidity in @xmath1-stable matter@xcite , the @xmath51 proton superfluidity becomes critical in determining the outcome of neutron star cooling . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected in ref.@xcite that the main suppression ( of the neutrino production ) comes from the superfluid proton in the @xmath0 state . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , the predicted suppression of the @xmath0 proton pairing gap does not favor the proton superfluid phase which is expected to suppress the modified urca processes in the interior of a neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the recent result of link  @xcite derived from the observations of long - period precession in isolated pulsars . </S>"
