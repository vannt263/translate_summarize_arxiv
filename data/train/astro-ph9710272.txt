    "in the 50  mev to 10  gev energy range the crab emits both pulsed emission , from the central neutron star , and unpulsed emission , from the surrounding nebula ( nolan et al .",
    "the crab nebula has been extensively studied from radio and optical to x - ray bands , and these photons are believed to originate as synchrotron emission from high energy electrons accelerated up to @xmath1 100 tev in the nebula ( de jager & harding  1992 hereafter jh92 ; atoyan & aharonian  1996 hereafter aa96 ) . the higher energy component , above @xmath11 gev",
    ", however , is thought to be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering between these very high energy electrons and ambient photons in the nebula . in the wide range from gev to hundreds of tev ,",
    "gamma rays are expected to emanate from the crab nebula via the ic process .",
    "spectra have been calculated for various theoretical scenarios based on the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model , using the synchrotron spectrum obtained from observations of radio to mev gamma rays as seed photons ( jh92;aa96 ) .",
    "the predicted spectra for synchrotron and ic emission are sensitive to conditions within the nebula such as the magnetic field , the nature of the seed photons , and the maximum energy of high energy electrons , which allow us to test these models . in particular",
    ", all models predict that the shape of the spectrum becomes more sensitive to a change of the parameters of the nebula as the gamma - ray energy increases .",
    "observations of the ic domain have been made in the 0.110 gev region by _ egret _ ( nolan et al .  1993 ; de jager et al .",
    "1996 ) and the 0.210 tev region by imaging air erenkov telescopes ( iacts ) ( vacanti et al .  1991",
    "; goret et al .",
    "1993 ; tanimori et al .",
    "1994 hereafter t94 ; djannati - atai et al .  1995 ; aharonian et al .  1997 ; cater - lewis et al .",
    "_ egret _ observations have revealed a break in the energy spectrum of the unpulsed component from the crab nebula above 0.1 gev , which is believed to signal the change from synchrotron radiation by several hundreds tev electrons at lower energies to ic emission at higher energies .",
    "unpulsed emission above 200 gev up to 10 tev has been detected by several iacts with high statistics , although there still remains considerable uncertainty in the absolute flux and the spectral index .",
    "however , there exists only one observation of the detection for gamma rays above @xmath1 10 tev with limited statistics : by the themistocle group with a multiple small mirror system ( djannati - atai et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "as pointed out above , the observation of gamma rays in the energy range above 10 tev is the key to understanding of the ic process in the nebula . the large zenith angle technique ( sommers & elbert 1987 ) was used by the cangaroo group in the detection of gamma rays from the crab in 1992 to obtain a single integral flux point of @xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5 above 7 tev at large zenith angles , @xmath153(t94 ) , and has provided the current best sensitivity for detecting @xmath610 tev gamma rays among the various methods .",
    "the observations reported here were made with the 3.8 m telescope of the cangaroo collaboration ( patterson and kifune 1992 ) , which is located at woomera in south australia ( 13647e and 3106s ) .",
    "the high resolution camera , set at the prime focus , consists of small square - shaped photomultiplier tubes of 10 mm @xmath7 10 mm size ( hamamatsu r2248 ) .",
    "the number of photomultipliers was 220 in 1993 and was increased to 256 , in a 16@xmath716 square pattern , in 1995 giving a total field of view of about 3 .",
    "the details of the camera and telescope are given in hara et al .",
    "after the observations in 1992 , the crab was observed again at zenith angles of 5356  in two seasons ; from 1993 december to 1994 january , and from 1995 december to 1996 january . in order to monitor the cosmic ray background contained in on - source data ,",
    "off - source runs were also done as described in t94 . in order to obtain an energy spectrum ,",
    "1992 data was analyzed again with 1993 and 1995 data .",
    "the total observation times in those three years used in this analysis were @xmath8  s ( @xmath9  s for 1993 and 1995 data ) for on - source data and @xmath10  s ( @xmath11  s for 1993 and 1995 data ) for off source data .",
    "the imaging analysis of the data is based on parameterization of the elongated shape of the erenkov light image as : `` width'',``length '' , `` distance '' ( location ) , `` conc '' ( shape ) , and the image orientation angle @xmath12 ( hillas 1985 ; weekes et al .",
    "we analyzed the data of 1992 , 1993 , and 1995 observations by the similar parameters used in t94 ; the gamma - ray selection criteria used here are @xmath13 length @xmath14 , @xmath15 width @xmath16 and @xmath17 distance @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the concentration of the yield of erenkov light in the image `` conc '' was required , taking account of the energy dependence .",
    "here we have determined above cut parameters as loose as possible to avoid both over - cutting @xmath19-ray events and the distortion of the flatness of the @xmath12 distribution for background events : by adjusting a cut parameter not to appear any @xmath12 peak near 0 in the on - source data removed by the cut , which eventually reduces the systematic errors .",
    "the detail is described in t94 .",
    "the resulting event distributions in the combined 1992 , 1993 and 1995 data - set are plotted in fig.[fig : f1]a as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 peak appearing around the origin @xmath20 in the on - source data are attributed to @xmath19-rays from the crab , and the number of background events in the @xmath12 peak region was estimated from the flat region of the @xmath12 distribution ( 3090 ) in the on - source data . here off - source data was used to verify the non - existence of a peculiar structure of the @xmath12 plot around the origin without gamma - ray events .",
    "the statistical significance of the @xmath12 peak is calculated using the following : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the numbers of events in the source region @xmath24 and in the background region @xmath25 of the on - source data respectively , and @xmath26 is the ratio of the @xmath12 range of the source region ( 15 ) to the background region ( 60 ) .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak in fig.[fig : f1]a thus obtained is 7.2@xmath27 .",
    "effects due to the bright star @xmath28 tau , visual magnitude 3.0 , which is located 1.1  from the crab and within the field of view of the camera , were investigated by the same procedure as used previously ( t94 ) .",
    "we found no effect which would cause false @xmath12 peaks .",
    "the collecting area as a function of energy and threshold energy of the telescope for gamma - ray showers have been inferred from a monte carlo simulation as described in patterson & hillas  ( 1990 ) and t94 . in order to obtain the energy spectrum ,",
    "@xmath12 plots were made by varying the minimum and maximum numbers of detected erenkov photons , required in the event analysis .",
    "the energy of gamma - rays is defined as the energy of the maximum flux of simulated gamma - ray events having a similar amount of erenkov light to the detected events .",
    "the spectrum was then estimated as follows .",
    "first , simulated events were generated between 3 tev and 70 tev , assuming a differential power law index of @xmath29 .",
    "the collecting area , trigger efficiency and threshold energy corresponding to each @xmath12 plot were independently estimated from the simulation result , and a spectrum was calculated . using this new spectrum ,",
    "the simulation was repeated and the spectrum recalculated .",
    "we iterated these steps until the spectral index converged . the resultant differential spectrum , _",
    "j(e ) _ , between 7 tev and 50 tev is plotted in fig.[fig : f2 ] , and can be written as : @xmath30 where the errors are statistical ones only .",
    "the systematic errors on the flux and the index due mainly to the event selection procedure are estimated to be @xmath31% and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "another systematic error of 50% on the flux arises from the uncertainty of the absolute gamma - ray energy of 25% , which is due mainly to errors in the estimation of the number of detected photo - electrons and the reflectivity of the telescope mirror .",
    "the total systematic error on the flux is 58% .",
    "the resultant differential spectrum smoothly connects with new results of the whipple group from 500  gev and up to 8  tev ( cater - lewis et al .",
    "1997 ) as shown in fig.[fig : f2 ] .",
    "for comparison with other results above 10 tev , the integral flux is presented in fig.[fig : f3 ] , which is consistent with the result of the themistocle group ( djannati - atai et al .",
    "1995 ) and several upper limits of gamma - ray flux obtained by array - type experiments ( alexandreas et al .  1991 ; amenomori et al .",
    "1992 ; karle et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figs.[fig : f1]b,[fig : f1]c , and [ fig : f1]d show the @xmath12 plots for the events of @xmath33 20 tev , @xmath33 37 tev , and @xmath33 47 tev , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath12 peak above the hadronic background becomes clearer as the threshold energy increases . in order to show the hardness of the observed spectrum ,",
    "the ratio of the number of gamma rays to that of the background , are plotted as a function of threshold energy of gamma rays in fig.[fig : f4 ] , where gamma - rays events in the @xmath12 peak ( @xmath34 ) and background events with ( 30@xmath3590 ) were used .",
    "these ratios were calculated using the data to which only a simple distance cut were applied in order to avoid an energy dependence of the rejection efficiencies of the imaging cuts for hadrons .",
    "the energy dependence of the trigger efficiencies for both gamma rays and hadrons are taken into account using the same monte carlo simulation .",
    "fig.[fig : f4 ] shows that this ratio increases as the threshold energy rises .",
    "this ratio is expected to be sensitive to the existence of the spectral cut - off because the hadron spectrum absolutely extends with the constant index of 2.7 up to more than hundreds tev .",
    "assuming the spectral cut - offs of 30 , 50 and 100 tev , the energy dependence of this ratio was simulated including the energy resolution as shown in fig.[fig : f4 ] , where both differential indices of ours ( 2.53 ) and the whipple group ( 2.45 ) were examined .",
    "the result obviously favors the nonexistence of the spectral cut - off at least less than 50 tev : reduced @xmath36s of our data are 5.70 ( 30 tev cut - off ) , 2.74 ( 50 tev cut - off ) and 0.85 ( 100 tev cut - off ) .    in addition , the differential spectrum of the background cosmic rays was calculated from this data to be @xmath37 tev@xmath5str@xmath5@xmath4s@xmath5 in the energy range of 13  tev to 110  tev , where the error represents only statistical one .",
    "it is noted that the differential cosmic ray spectral index can be reconstructed with good accuracy , which also shows the validity of the estimation of the relative energy scale for the gamma rays .",
    "the maximum systematic error of our simulation for the cosmic ray flux is @xmath150% because we assumed all cosmic rays are protons in the simulation .",
    "the resultant flux agrees with the recent results of balloon - borne experiments ( ichimura et al .",
    "1993 ) within @xmath120% for the proton flux .",
    "thus , the spectra of both gamma rays and cosmic rays are obtained from the same measurement , which is the first attempt as far as we know .",
    "it presents the independent and absolute calibration to estimate the energy spectrum in air erenkov experiments .",
    "improvements of the simulation are under way , taking account of the other main ingredients of the cosmic ray flux .",
    "very high energy gamma rays from the crab nebula are believed to originate in the shock acceleration of electrons by the pulsar wind in the nebula ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) , but a possible origin within the pulsar magnetosphere near the light cylinder ( cheung & cheng 1994 ) has not been ruled out , observational proof being lacking . in this region ,",
    "the strong magnetic field decreases the emissivity of the multi - tev gamma rays by the electron - positron pair creation process between gamma rays and the magnetic field .",
    "gamma rays above 10  tev therefore can not emanate from the vicinity of the light cylinder ( cheung & cheng 1994 ) .",
    "our observation of gamma rays up to 50  tev strongly disfavours this idea , and provides direct evidence that the very high energy relativistic particles are accelerated by the pulsar wind .",
    "as mentioned previously , the whole of ic gamma - ray spectrum for the crab have been calculated by several authors on the basis of the ssc model .",
    "recently it has been pointed out by aa96 that cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and infrared ( ir ) photons emitted from dust in the nebula are the main seed photons for tev gamma - ray production by the ic process .",
    "these effects modify the spectrum of tev gamma rays from the crab , causing it to be flatter than that calculated by the simple ssc model .",
    "the spectrum above @xmath1 100  gev is predicted to steepen as the energy increases , due to the klein - nishina limit in the ssc process . on the other hand ,",
    "the gamma rays produced by ic with low energy seed photons such as cmb or ir are predicted to have flat spectra up to a few tev ( thomson limit ) .",
    "consequently , the combined spectrum including the effects of ssc , and ic with cmb and ir , retains its integral index of @xmath38 up to the @xmath39  tev region .",
    "observations of tev gamma rays by the whipple , hegra , themistocle , and cangaroo collaborations are evidence of the significant contribution of ic with cmb and ir .    furthermore , as the energy increases , the observed spectrum departs from the theoretical calculations of all models which include only the above contributions such as the calculation of aa96 .",
    "intrinsically , the higher energy gamma rays generated by the ic process have a naturally steeper spectrum due to synchrotron energy loss in magnetic fields . hence all models based on electron processes have difficulty in explaining the observed hard spectrum which extends to beyond 50  tev .",
    "one simple idea to explain this is to consider the gamma - rays from @xmath40 generated by protons which may be included in a pulsar wind and accelerated by its terminated shock similarly to leptons .",
    "the spectrum of gamma - rays from @xmath40 is expected to retain its hard differential index of @xmath41 up to near the maximum accelerated energy . above @xmath110 tev , this component gradually may raise its ratio in the whole gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "aa96 presented a calculation based on such an assumption considering proton acceleration in the nebula , in which all parameters , such as the total energy used in proton acceleration , were constrained to satisfy the observational data of the crab . in the case of protons having an differential index of @xmath42 ,",
    "the resulting spectrum of tev gamma rays keeps its differential index of @xmath43 beyond 50  tev which matches very well with our result .",
    "although it can not be said that our result is strong evidence of proton acceleration in the crab nebula , it is supportive of this claim  further observations of the crab are clearly of great importance .    in order to obtain direct evidence of proton acceleration , two observations are necessary : one is the observation of the extension of the hard spectrum up to 100 tev , and the other is a measurement of the size of the emission region of gamma rays @xmath33  10  tev . in the crab nebula , very high energy electrons in the multi - tev region emit both x - rays by synchrotron radiation and tev gamma rays by ic .",
    "the size of the x - ray emission region is therefore directly related to that of the emission region of tev gamma rays .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri image at 12 kev ( hester et al .",
    "1995 ) suggests the emission region of tev gamma rays is concentrated within 2  of the center of the crab nebula , if tev gamma rays are generated by ic . on the other hand",
    ", protons can occupy the cavity within the crab nebula of diameter @xmath1 7 .",
    "if multi tev gamma rays from the crab are mainly due to high energy protons , the observed source size would increase as the energy goes above 10 tev .",
