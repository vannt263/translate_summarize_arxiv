    "the forest - fire model of statistical mechanics has been introduced by henley @xcite and drossel - schwabl @xcite in the context of self - organized criticality . from the rigorous point of view",
    ", the one - dimensional forest - fire model has been studied by van den berg - jarai @xcite , brouwer - pennanen @xcite and by the authors @xcite .",
    "we refer to the introduction of @xcite for many details .",
    "0.15 cm    let us now describe the one - dimensional forest - fire model : on each site of @xmath9 , seeds fall at rate @xmath4 and matches fall at rate @xmath10 , for some ( large ) @xmath7 . each time a seed falls on a vacant site , this site immediately becomes occupied ( by a tree ) .",
    "each time a match falls on an occupied site , it immediately burns the corresponding occupied connected component .",
    "0.15 cm    from the point of view of self - organized criticality , it is interesting to study what happens when @xmath6 increases to infinity",
    ". then matches are very rare , but tree clusters are huge before they burn . in @xcite , we have established that after normalization , the forest - fire process converges , as @xmath8 , to a scaling limit .      we now introduce a mean - field model formally related to the forest - fire process , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) for a similar study when @xmath11 .",
    "assume that each edge of @xmath9 has mass @xmath4 .",
    "say that two adjacent edges @xmath12 and @xmath13 are glued if the site @xmath3 is occupied",
    ". then adjacent clusters coalesce at rate @xmath4 and each cluster with mass @xmath14 ( containing @xmath14 edges and @xmath15 sites ) breaks up into @xmath14 clusters with mass @xmath4 at rate @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the concentration ( number per unit of length ) of clusters with mass @xmath18 at time @xmath19 .",
    "then the total mass should satisfy @xmath20 for all @xmath19 . neglecting correlations ( which is far from being justified )",
    ", the family @xmath21 would satisfy the following system of differential equations called @xmath22 : @xmath23 the first term on the rhs of ( [ eqt1 ] ) expresses a cluster with mass @xmath4 disappears at rate @xmath1 ( because it glues with each of its two neighbors at rate @xmath4 ) ; the second term on the rhs of ( [ eqt1 ] ) says that @xmath14 clusters with mass @xmath4 appear each time a cluster with mass @xmath14 takes fire , which occurs at rate @xmath16 .",
    "the first term on the rhs of ( [ eqt2 ] ) explains that a cluster with mass @xmath14 disappears at rate @xmath24 ( because it glues with each of its two neighbors at rate @xmath4 and takes fire at rate @xmath16 ) .",
    "finally , the second term on the rhs of ( [ eqt2 ] ) says that when a seed falls between two clusters with masses @xmath3 and @xmath25 , a cluster with mass @xmath14 appears . the number per unit of length of pairs of neighbor clusters with masses @xmath3 and @xmath25 is nothing but @xmath26 . here",
    "we implicitly use an independence argument which is not valid for the true forest - fire model .",
    "0.15 cm    the system ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) can almost be seen as a special coagulation - fragmentation equation , see e.g. aizenman - bak @xcite and carr @xcite , where particles with masses @xmath3 and @xmath27 coalesce at constant rate @xmath28 and where particles with mass @xmath29 break up into @xmath3 particles with mass @xmath4 at rate @xmath30 .",
    "however there is the acceleration factor @xmath31 in front of the coagulation term .",
    "the link between @xmath22 and the forest - fire model is only formal .",
    "observe however that if there are only seeds * or * only matches , then the link is rigorous .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(i ) assume that all sites of @xmath9 are initially vacant and that seeds fall on each site of @xmath9 at rate @xmath4 , so that each site is occupied at time @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 .",
    "call @xmath34 the probability that the edge @xmath35 belongs to a cluster with mass @xmath14 at time @xmath32 .",
    "a simple computation shows that @xmath36 . by space stationarity , the concentration @xmath37 of particles with mass @xmath14 at time @xmath32 satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "then one easily checks that the family @xmath39 satisfies ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) with no fragmentation term ( i.e. @xmath40 ) .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(ii ) the fragmentation term is linear and generates _ a priori _ no correlation .",
    "assume that we have initially some given concentrations @xmath41 , so that the edge @xmath35 belongs to a cluster with mass @xmath14 with probability @xmath42 and that only matches fall , at rate @xmath10 on each site .",
    "then the probability @xmath34 that the edge @xmath35 belongs to a cluster with mass @xmath14 at time @xmath32 is simply given by @xmath43 if @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 is the probability that no match has fallen on our cluster before time @xmath32 ) and @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "writing @xmath47 as previously , we see that the family @xmath39 satisfies the fragmentation equations @xmath48 and , for @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "0.15 cm    when one takes into account both coalescence and fragmentation , the rigorous link between the two models breaks down : in the true forest - fire model , fragmentation ( fires ) produces small clusters which are close to each other , so that a small cluster has more chance to have small clusters as coalescence partners .",
    "however , we have seen numerically in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) that at equilibrium , in the special case where @xmath11 , the two models are very close to each other .",
    "initially , the motivation of the present study was to decide if ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) is a good approximation of the true forest - fire model , at least from a qualitative point of view : do we have the same scales and same features ( as @xmath8 ) ?",
    "we will see that this is not really the case . however , we believe that ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) is a very interesting model , at least theoretically , since    @xmath51 many explicit computations are possible for ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) ,    @xmath51 we observe self - organized criticality ,    @xmath51 we show that two interesting points of view ( size - biased and non size - biased particles mass distribution ) lead to quite different conclusions ,    @xmath51 we have some probabilistic interpretations of our results .      we will show in this paper the existence of a unique equilibrium state @xmath52 with total mass @xmath53 for @xmath22 , for each @xmath54 fixed and we study the asymptotics of rare fires @xmath8 .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(i ) we show that the particles mass distribution @xmath55 , defined by @xmath56 , goes weakly to the law @xmath57 of the number of leaves of a critical binary galton - watson tree , which is explicit and satisfies @xmath58 as @xmath59 ;    0.15 cm    \\(ii ) we prove that the size - biased particles mass distribution @xmath60 goes weakly to , after normalization of the masses by @xmath61 , to a continuous limit profile @xmath62 with total mass @xmath4 , for which we have two explicit expressions : the first one involves the zeroes of the airy function and its derivative , while the laplace transform of the brownian excursion s area appears in the second one .",
    "furthermore , we check that @xmath63 as @xmath64 and @xmath65 as @xmath66 , for some positive explicit constants @xmath67 .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(iii ) we explain how to simulate perfectly , for @xmath54 fixed , a random variable @xmath68 with law @xmath69 and a random variable @xmath70 with law @xmath60 , using some pruned galton - watson trees .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(iv ) we deduce from ( iii ) an easy probabilistic interpretation of point ( i ) : roughly , @xmath69 can be viewed as the law of the number of leaves of a pruned critical galton - watson tree , and we only have to check that almost no pruning occurs when @xmath6 is very large .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(v ) we also derive a probabilistic interpretation of ( ii ) , which seems quite natural , since the brownian excursion s area appears in the limit .",
    "this part is quite complicated .",
    "the main idea is that that the pruned galton - watson tree of which the number of leaves is @xmath60-distributed has a scaling limit , which is nothing but a pruned continuum random tree ( precisely , a pruned self - similar crt , see aldous @xcite ) .",
    "we do not prove rigorously that this scaling limit arises .",
    "however , we show that in some precise sense , the number of leaves of the pruned crt under consideration is indeed @xmath71-distributed , where @xmath72 is the limit profile found in point ( ii ) .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(vi ) finally , this pruned crt ( heuristically ) leads to a noticeable diffusion process ( rigorously ) enjoying the strange property that its drift coefficient equals the laplace exponent of its inverse local time at @xmath73 .",
    "0.15 cm    let us discuss briefly points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the particles mass distribution is , roughly , the law of the mass of a particle chosen uniformly at random .",
    "the size - biased particles mass distribution is , roughly , the law of the mass of the particle containing a given _ atom _",
    ", this atom being chosen uniformly at random ( think that a particle with mass @xmath14 is composed of @xmath14 atoms ) .",
    "0.15 cm    point ( i ) says that if one picks a particle at random , then its mass @xmath68 is finite ( uniformly in @xmath6 ) and goes in law , as @xmath8 , to a _",
    "critical _ probability distribution ( with infinite expectation ) . point ( ii ) says that if one picks an atom at random , then the mass @xmath70 of the particle including this atom is of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 goes in law to an explicit probability distribution with moments of all orders .",
    "let us now comment on these results .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(a ) self - organized criticality , see bak - tang - wiesenfield @xcite and henley @xcite , is a popular concept in physics .",
    "the main idea is the following : in statistical mechanics , there are often some _ critical _ parameters , for which special features occur .",
    "consider e.g. the case of percolation in @xmath76 , see grimmett @xcite : for @xmath77 fixed , open each edge independently with probability @xmath78 .",
    "there is a critical parameter @xmath79 such that for @xmath80 , there is a.s .",
    "no infinite open path , while for @xmath81 , there is a.s . one infinite open path .",
    "if @xmath82 , all the open paths are small ( the cluster - size distribution has an exponential decay ) .",
    "if @xmath83 , there is only one infinite open path , which is huge , and all the finite open paths are small .",
    "but if @xmath84 , there are some large finite open paths ( with a heavy tail distribution ) . and",
    "it seems that such phenomena , reminiscent from criticality , sometimes occur in nature , where nobody is here to finely tune the parameters .",
    "hence one looks for models in which criticality occurs naturally .",
    "we refer to the introduction of @xcite for many details .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(b ) thus we observe here self - organized criticality for the particles mass distribution , since the limit distribution @xmath57 has a heavy tail and is indeed related to a _",
    "critical _ binary galton - watson process .",
    "observe that point ( i ) is quite strange at first glance . indeed , when @xmath8 , the time - dependent equations ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) tend to some coagulation equations without fragmentation , for which there is no equilibrium ( because all the particles masses tend to infinity ) .",
    "however , the equilibrium state for ( [ eqt1])-([eqt2 ] ) tends to some non - trivial equilibrium state as @xmath8 .",
    "this is quite surprising : the limit ( as @xmath8 ) of the equilibrium is not the equilibrium of the limit .",
    "observe that this is indeed _ self - organized _ criticality : the _ critical _ galton - watson tree appears automatically in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "a possible heuristic argument is that in some sense , in the limit @xmath8 , only infinite clusters are destroyed .",
    "we thus let clusters grow as much as they want , but we do not let them become infinite .",
    "thus the system reaches _ by itself _ a critical state .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(c ) for the size - biased particles mass distribution , we observe no self - organized criticality , since the limit profile has an exponential decay .",
    "the two points of view ( size - biased or not ) seem interesting and our results show that they really enjoy different features .",
    "let us insist on the fact that the particles mass distribution converges without rescaling , while the size - biased particles mass distribution converges after rescaling .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are many small particles and very few very large particles , so that when one picks a particle at random , we get a rather small particle , while when one picks an atom at random , it belongs to a rather large particle .",
    "mathematically , since the limiting particles mass distribution has no expectation , it is no more possible to write properly the corresponding size - biased distribution : a normalization is necessary .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(d ) let us mention the paper of rth - tth @xcite , who consider a forest - fire model on the complete graph . in a suitable regime",
    ", they obtain the same critical distribution @xmath57 as we do ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula ( 14 ) ) ) .",
    "but in their case , this is the limit of the _ size - biased _ particles mass distribution .",
    "their model rather corresponds to the case of a multiplicative coagulation kernel ( clusters of masses @xmath14 and @xmath85 coalesce at rate @xmath86 ) .",
    "hence we exhibit , in some sense , a link between the smoluchowski equation with constant kernel and the smoluchowski equation with multiplicative kernel .",
    "see remark [ multconst ] for a precise statement . in the same spirit ,",
    "recall the link found by deaconu - tanr @xcite between multiplicative and additive coalescence .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(e ) for the true forest - fire process , we proved in @xcite the presence of _ macroscopic _ clusters , with masses of order @xmath87 and of _ microscopic _ clusters , with masses of order @xmath88 , for all values of @xmath89 .",
    "these microscopic clusters interact with macroscopic clusters in that they limit the impact of fires . hence , while the scales are really different here , we observe something similar : in some sense , the particles mass distribution describes _ microscopic _ clusters , while the size - biased the particles mass distribution describes _ macroscopic _ clusters .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(f ) the trend to equilibrium for coagulation - fragmentation equations has been much studied , see e.g. aizenman - bak @xcite and carr @xcite , under a reversibility condition , often called _ detailed balance condition_. such a reversibility assumption can not hold here , because particles merge by pairs and break into an arbitrary large number of smaller clusters . without reversibility ,",
    "much less is known : a special case has been studied by dubowski - stewart @xcite and a general result has been obtained in @xcite under a smallness condition saying that fragmentation is much stronger than coalescence .",
    "none of the above results may apply to the present model ( at least for @xmath6 slightly large ) . for the specific model under study",
    "we are able to prove the uniqueness of the equilibrium , but not the trend to equilibrium .",
    "0.15 cm    \\(g ) finally , let us mention that our probabilistic interpretation of ( ii ) uses extensively aldous s theory on continuum random trees @xcite , which has been developed by duquesne - le gall @xcite",
    ". some pruning procedures of such crts have been introduced by abraham - delmas - voisin @xcite .",
    "roughly , the prune the crt by choosing cut - points uniformly in the tree ( uniformly according to the lebesgue measure on the tree ) .",
    "our pruning procedure is very different : we choose leaves ( according to the measure on leaves ) , these leaves send some cut - points on the branches ( joining them to the root ) .",
    "then we prune according to these cut - points , in a suitable order .",
    "the cut - points sent by leaves belonging to subtrees previously pruned are deactivated .",
    "the next section is devoted to the precise statement of points ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "section [ pr ] contains the proofs of points ( i ) and ( ii ) , which are purely analytic . using discrete pruned random trees ,",
    "we indicate how to simulate perfectly a typical particle and a size - biased typical particle in section [ proba ] .",
    "finally , we study in section [ proba2 ] a possible scaling limit of the discrete tree representing a typical size - biased particle .",
    "for a @xmath90-valued sequence @xmath91 and for @xmath92 , we put @xmath93    let @xmath7 .",
    "a sequence @xmath94 of nonnegative real numbers is said solve @xmath95 if it is an equilibrium state for @xmath22 with total mass @xmath4 : @xmath96 observe that it then automatically holds that @xmath97    to check this last claim , multiply ( [ eq2 ] ) by @xmath14 , sum for @xmath44 , use ( [ eq0 ] ) and that @xmath98 . one finds @xmath99/n=2 $ ] , from which ( [ eq1 ] ) readily follows .",
