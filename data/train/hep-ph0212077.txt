    "the quark models of baryons can be divided into two main classes : ( i ) _ constituent quark models _ describing baryons as bound states of three massive quarks interacting via a phenomenological potential and ( ii ) _ chiral models _ with `` bare '' quarks surrounded by a cloud of either effective meson fields or @xmath0 pairs .",
    "the chiral model distinguishes itself from the constituent quark models in that the baryon masses , as well as the constituent quark masses are generated dynamically .",
    "the two classes of models describe hadrons at two different levels : at a higher level , the constituent quark model successfully predicts the spectrum of baryons and their excited states ; at a lower level , the chiral models are able to describe the vacuum , meson and baryon sectors with the same effective lagrangian and they model the origin of the masses of constituent quarks and in particular the role the chiral mesons play in the constituent quark model .",
    "we present here the calculation of solitons in njl - type models and discuss how different regularization schemes influence the stability of solutions .",
    "we focus on the version with non - local quark interactions as suggested from the instanton - liquid model which supports stable solutions without introducing artificial constraints as in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "the njl model assumes an attractive interaction between quarks constructed in terms of quark bilinears in a form that obeys the chiral symmetry . to describe low energy phenomena ,",
    "it is enough to consider the non - strange quarks and keep only the scalar and pseudoscalar terms .",
    "( for a review of the model and its applications see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in the chiral limit , the lagrangian becomes : @xmath1\\ ; , \\label{l}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the isospin index .",
    "the interaction is point - like and the uv divergences have to be removed by a suitable regularization prescription .    to solve the model in the mean - field ( hartree ) approximation",
    "it is practical to introduce auxiliary chiral fields @xmath3 such that the lagrangian takes the _ semi - bosonized _ form : @xmath4 @xmath5    the vacuum in the hartree approximation is calculated by assuming a constant value , @xmath6 , for @xmath7 and evaluating @xmath8 in ( [ fields ] ) by summing up the bubble graphs or , equivalently , by performing functional integration over the quark fields .",
    "this yields the so called `` gap equation '' : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes a regularized sum over quark states with a cut - off parameter @xmath11 . starting from a zero mass",
    "we have generated a finite quark mass .",
    "the model thus exhibits the _",
    "spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry _",
    ", yielding a nonzero value for the vacuum quark condensate @xmath12 , and three goldstone bosons ( pions ) corresponding to small oscillation of the pseudoscalar field around its vacuum value @xmath13 .",
    "the model predicts the pion decay constant , @xmath14 , and for a finite current quark mass , @xmath15 , also a finite pion mass satisfying the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation .",
    "two of the three free parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath11 , or @xmath17 can be eliminated by fitting @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "the remaining free parameter is usually expressed in term of @xmath6 , the so - called _ constituent mass_.    in calculations of mesons and baryons several regularization schemes have been used including a _ sharp cut - off _ in 3- or 4-dimensions , the _ proper - time _ and _ pauli - villars _ regularizations and _ non - local regulators _ as suggested from the instanton - liquid model .",
    "all of them require a rather low cut - off parameter , @xmath19  mev , which indicates that it may be derivable from the underlying theory .",
    "indeed , the instanton - liquid model @xcite predicts a non - local interaction between quarks with @xmath11 related to the inter - instanton spacing @xmath20  mev .",
    "the calculated vacuum properties ( quark condensate , gluon condensate ) suggest the value @xmath6 should lie in the range between 300 and 400  mev .    the soliton , corresponding to a baryon , is constructed around three valence quarks that polarize the vacuum generating a spatially non - trivial configuration . the resulting mean - field potential may make the system stable against decaying into free quarks .",
    "this is not a mechanism of confinement but simply a mechanism to bind quarks .",
    "if this scenario is realized it means that the interactions of the quarks with the chiral field may play an equally important role in the formation of the baryon as the color confining forces .    the existence of a stable solution is closely related to the choice of regularization scheme . a simple sharp cut - off does not yield stable solutions . using the proper - time or pauli - villars regularization",
    "a stable soliton can be formed only by restricting the chiral fields to lie on the chiral circle , i.e. @xmath21 , otherwise the scalar field acquires an arbitrarily low value at the origin producing a strongly localized state with a zero energy .",
    "such a constraint does not have any justification in the model .",
    "it is only in the version with non - local regulators that solitons exist without introducing additional constraints .",
    "in a non - local version of the njl , the @xmath0 interaction is smeared by replacing the quark fields in the interaction part of ( [ l ] ) by _ delocalized quark fields _ : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a regulator , diagonal in @xmath24-space , and @xmath24 is the _ euclidean _",
    "4-momentum , @xmath25 .",
    "the instanton - liquid model predicts a form of the regulator . for model calculations it is simpler to take a gaussian form , @xmath26 .",
    "using the euclidean formulation the dirac hamiltonian takes the form @xmath27    the key point is the construction of the valence orbit . let us first study the free quark propagator . in the chiral limit ( @xmath28 ) the inverse propagator takes the form @xmath29 .",
    "the pole ( setting @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) occurs at the solution of @xmath32 the most striking feature of ( [ mqeq ] ) is that the solution exists only below a critical value of @xmath6 . above this value ,",
    "free on - shell quarks do not exist in the vacuum .",
    "the treatment of the quark propagator in a spatially non - homogeneous field configuration of the soliton is a non - trivial problem because of the presence of the time - dependent regulator in the dirac hamiltonian . for stationary chiral fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 the dirac operator @xmath35 is diagonal in the energy representation : @xmath36 the lowest ( valence ) orbit is obtained as a solution of eq .",

    "( [ diracval ] ) exists for all @xmath6 beyond @xmath39 as shown in fig .",

    "the soliton is sought iteratively by assuming a hedgehog shape for the chiral fields .",
    "starting from an initial guess for @xmath40 and @xmath41 eq .  ( [ diraceq ] ) is solved for the valence orbit , @xmath42 , and the sea orbits , @xmath43 . in the next iterations new values for the chiral fields",

    "the calculated properties reflect a relatively large size of the soliton compared to solutions using e.g. the proper time regularization as well as to the experimental values . in our opinion",
    "this is a consequence of the mean - field treatment rather than a serious deficiency of the model .",
    "any improvement of the approximation such as elimination of spurious center - of - mass motion or projection onto subspace with good spin and isospin may considerably reduce the size @xcite .",
    "the solitons constructed in the chiral model with non - local regulators share several features found in more phenomenological models . from the model it is possible to derive a version of the linear @xmath57-model that approximates well the full model @xcite .",
    "the effective quark mass ( i.e the square root of @xmath58 shown in fig .  [ figmf ] ) drops almost to 0 in the center of the soliton for @xmath6 between 300  mev and 350  mev similarly as in models based on restoration of the chiral symmetry inside the baryon like different versions of the bag model .",

    "the solitons consisting of only one valence quark ( see fig .",
    "[ fige ] ) can be interpreted as constituent quarks . above @xmath59  mev",
    "these solutions are dressed in a cloud of chiral mesons that generate attraction and a 3-quark soliton is formed .",
    "the interaction between such objects calculated in the linear @xmath57-model @xcite shows a typical behavior of the potential used in the goldstone - meson exchange constituent quark model .",
