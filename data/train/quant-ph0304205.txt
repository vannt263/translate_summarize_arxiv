    "<S> recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in quantum information theory dealing with entanglement of continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cv entangled states of light hold the key for quantum communications at the high - intensity level , as cv analogues of various protocols developed originally in the framework of discrete quantum variables have been established ( see , for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> an important example provides entangled einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) state of orthogonally polarized but frequency degenerate beams , efficiently generated via nonlinear optical process of parametric down - conversion . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out in @xcite and has been demonstrated experimentally in @xcite for cv , employing sub - threshold nondegenarate optical parametric oscillator ( nopo ) . </S>",

    "<S> it should be noted that so far most experimental realizations of the cv  entanglement on nopo s have only been operated below threshold . </S>",
    "<S> a natural next step is the extension of these investigations to laser - like systems generating entangled bright - light states . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , both theoretical and experimental studies of these problems are very complicated and only rare examples are known up to now . </S>",
    "<S> many efforts have been devoted to the study of intensity correlated twin beams from nopo above threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional generation of sub - poissonian light from bright twin beams in the cv regime is experimentally demonstrated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental studies of bright two - mode entangled state from cw nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier have been made in refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of cv polarization entanglement by mixing a pair of polarization squeezed beams is realized in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to investigate physical properties and the presence of cv  entanglement for nopo in its transition through the generation threshold as well as in the regime of lasing . </S>",
    "<S> one of the principal problems in this study is the description of quantum fluctuations . in most theoretical works </S>",
    "<S> nonclassical effects and entanglement resources of nonlinear quantum systems are usually described within linear treatment of quantum noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that such approach does not describe the critical ranges ( threshold , point of multistability , etc ) where the level of quantum noise increases substantially . </S>",
    "<S> we use a more adequate approach within the framework of exact nonlinear treatment of quantum fluctuations via the solution of the fokker - planck equation for the quasiprobability distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> deriving the quasiprobability functions so far has been performed only for a few simple models ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the nopo the exact steady - state solution of the fokker - planck equation in the complex @xmath0-representation first </S>",
    "<S> was obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the generalized form of such solution @xcite which involves also detunings of the modes and hence admits bistability .    </S>",
    "<S> there are various questions that emerge in the study of these problems . because nopo displays both monostable and bistable regimes it is important to understand how the properties of entanglement depend on the operational regimes . </S>",
    "<S> what are peculiarities of entanglement in the vicinity of threshold ? will entanglement take place in the regime of lasing or how far it can be extended into the high intensity domain ? answering these questions is extremely important for a deeper understanding of quantum entanglement , and also from the perspective of creating an entangled light laser .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a type - ii phase matched nopo with triply resonant cavity that supports the pump mode at the frequency @xmath1 and two orthogonally polarized modes at the same frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the pump mode is driven by coherent field at the frequency @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant interaction hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are the operators of the modes @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the coupling constant , @xmath9 is the complex amplitude of the pump field . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in ( [ hamilt ] ) describes mode damping in the cavity in terms of the reservoir operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which determine the damping factors @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the detunings of the cavity @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume perfect symmetry between the orthogonally polarized modes provided that they decay at the same rate :  @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that linear treatment of nopo is not self - consistent due to the phase diffusion . according to this effect the difference between the phases of the signal and idler modes , as well as each of the phases </S>",
    "<S> can not be defined in the above threshold regime of generation . on the whole , the well founded linearization procedure can not be applied for this system . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the linearization procedure and analysis of quantum fluctuations for nopo become possible due to the additional assumptions about temporal behavior of the difference between the phases of the generated modes @xcite . within this assumption the two - mode squeezing spectra are obtained for both below- and above - threshold regimes . </S>",
    "<S> these results are inapplicable in the near - threshold as well as in the bistable ranges of generation , where a more accurate treatment of quantum noise is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of nopo is based on the steady - state exact solution of the fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious , that in the framework of this approach we avoid both difficulties of the linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> the price one has to pay for this advantage is the impossibility to perform temporal description of quantum fluctuations and hence squeezing spectra can not be calculated . </S>",

    "<S> we can make use of the semiclassical expression ( [ meanphotonclassical ] ) together with ( [ a1a2 ] ) to study the variance @xmath76 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath87 , and neglect @xmath88 only where that does nt lead to loss of accuracy in the formula ( [ r_expression ] ) . after some algebra ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) we arrive at the following expression : @xmath89 straightforward , but complicated analytical calculations on the formula ( [ meanphotonexact ] ) show that @xmath90 in the limit  @xmath91 , which leads to the asymptotic value @xmath92 ( find in appendix [ appendixb ] several hints regarding our analysis of @xmath88 ) . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> as our analysis shows with allowance for quantum fluctuations of arbitrary level , cv entanglement is always achieved in nopo above threshold . </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable , is that a very small quantum correction @xmath88 to the semiclassical intracavity photon number plays an essential role to the production of entanglement in high - intensity level . </S>",

    "<S> let us discuss the results ( [ vmin minimum ] ) , ( [ imin_expression ] ) in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> positiveness of @xmath109 means that the minimal value of @xmath76 does nt drop below @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs from the studied case of the perfect two - mode squeezing generated in an undamped nopa , where @xmath82 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , in our system the larger limiting value for @xmath76 is due to dissipation and cavity feedback effects . </S>",
    "<S> then we see that the point of maximal two - mode squeezing @xmath111 is located close to the generation threshold @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> function @xmath113 is negative for values of @xmath104 close to zero , however it increases and becomes positive as @xmath104 approaches 1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the point of maximal two - mode squeezing can be located both below and above the generation threshold of monostable dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> formulae ( [ vmin minimum ] ) and ( [ imin_expression ] ) are an example of a result that could nt be obtained with the help of linear treatment of quantum fluctuations . although the linearized theory gives correct expressions for @xmath114 in the below- and above - threshold ranges , it not only fails to link those solutions through the narrow range of the generation threshold of monostable regime , but also turns entirely invalid in the interjacent and bistable regimes .    in the light of experimental investigations of cv quadrature entanglement in nopa and nopo @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the obtained value for the highest achievable squeezing of 3db ( @xmath77 ) may seem inadequate . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the measurements of the frequency spectra of the variances of the output quadrature - phase amplitudes reveal up to 3.7db squeezing for nopa @xcite , and up to 4.9db squeezing for nopo operating above threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we remind that our results pertain to the full squeezing of the system and not the spectral component squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as noted in @xcite , states with even perfect squeezing of a certain spectral component may be non - squeezed in the full sense . </S>",
    "<S> note , that complete study of that question is beyond the scope of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> our results allow us to explain qualitatively the growth of @xmath76 in the critical region of bistability . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that the minimization of the variance @xmath115 is performed through a specific selection of phases of the quadrature amplitudes @xmath116 and @xmath117 - see formula ( [ minimizing_phases ] ) . in the bistable regime </S>",
    "<S> the state can be regarded as a mixture @xmath118 of two states corresponding to the weakly and strongly excited semiclassical stable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> what if both @xmath119 and @xmath120 are highly squeezed two - mode states , but the minimizing phases are rather different for them ? in this case the minimal variance for their mixture will be achieved for an intermediate value of the phases , which is good for none of them . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the phase of @xmath121 suggests that this is indeed the reason . </S>",

    "<S> [ theta_fig ] shows that the minimizing phase changes very abruptly in the bistable critical region . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the critical bistable regime the state is extremely different from gaussian and therefore the condition @xmath122 does not witness against entanglement since the criterion [ r_criterion ] provides only sufficient condition for cv entanglement in this case .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated cv entangling resources for all operational regimes of nondegenerate opo in the most basic and explicit way through the p - complex probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the entanglement as two - mode squeezing and have shown that entanglement is present in the system for quantum noise of arbitrary level and , what is remarkable , for a wide range of intensity of the coherent driving field including the far - above - threshold limit . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical and analytical analysis for the quantum critical range of nopo has provided a clear distinction between the degree of two - mode squeezing for monostable and bistable regimes . </S>",
    "<S> most favorable is the monostable regime where cv  entanglement can be maintained for all values of the pump intensity and for experimentally available parameters . in our study </S>",
    "<S> we have not analyzed any entanglement measure which is extremely difficult to handle analytically for non - gaussian states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this topic is currently being explored and will be the subject of forthcoming work . </S>",
    "<S> we hope the results obtained can serve as a guide for further theoretical and experimental studies of bright cv entangled light .    </S>",
