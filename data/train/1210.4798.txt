    "throughout this paper , @xmath9 will denote the _ directed _ @xmath0-dimensional binary hypercube .",
    "this is the directed graph whose nodes are all binary strings of length @xmath0 , with an edge between any pair of nodes that differ in exactly one bit , the edge being always directed toward the node with the greater number of ones .",
    "let @xmath10 be any two functions .",
    "we will employ the following notation throughout , all of which is quite standard :    @xmath11 means that @xmath12 ;    @xmath13 means that @xmath14 ;    @xmath15 means that @xmath16 ;    @xmath17 means that @xmath18 ;    @xmath19 means that @xmath20 ;    @xmath21 means that both @xmath17 and @xmath20 hold ;    @xmath22 means that @xmath23 .",
    "now suppose instead that @xmath24 are two sequences of random variables .",
    "we write @xmath11 if , for all @xmath25 and @xmath0 sufficiently large , @xmath26 similarly , we write @xmath15 if , for all @xmath27 and @xmath0 sufficiently large , @xmath28",
    "in many basic mathematical models of genetic mutations , the genome is represented as a node of the directed @xmath0-dimensional binary hypercube @xmath29 , and each mutation involves the flipping of a single bit from @xmath30 ( the `` wild '' state ) to @xmath6 ( the `` mutant '' state ) , hence displacement along an edge of @xmath9 . each node @xmath31 is assigned a real number @xmath32 , called its _ fitness_. the fitness of a node is not a constant , but is drawn from some probability distribution specified by the model .",
    "this distribution may vary from node to node in more or less complicated ways , depending on the model .",
    "basically , however , evolution is considered as favoring mutational pathways which , on average , lead to higher fitness .",
    "a fundamental concept in this regard is the following ( see @xcite ) :    [ de1.1 ] let @xmath33 be a fitness function .",
    "a _ ( selectively ) accessible path _ in @xmath34 is a path @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 , @xmath39 denote the all - zeroes and all - ones vertices in @xmath9 .",
    "a basic question in such models is whether accessible paths from @xmath1 to  @xmath2 exist or not with high probability . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , the words `` accessible path '' will always refer to such a path which starts at @xmath1 and ends at @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , it will only be in the proof of proposition  [ prop : bootstrap ] that we will need to consider accessible paths with other start- and endpoints",
    ".    we shall be concerned below with the following three well - known models , in which no rigorous answer has previously been given to the question of whether or not accessible paths exist with high probability .",
    "[ mo1 ] this model is originally attributed to kingman @xcite . in the form we consider below",
    ", it was first studied by kauffman and levin @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath40 and , for every other node @xmath41 , independently let @xmath42 , the uniform distribution on the interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "[ mo2 ] this variant seems to have been considered only more recently ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the only difference from model [ mo1 ] is that we fix @xmath44 .",
    "[ mo3 ] this model was first proposed in @xcite ; see also @xcite . for each @xmath31 , one lets @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a positive number called the _ drift _ , @xmath47 denotes hamming distance and the @xmath48 are independent random variables of some fixed distribution . in other words ,",
    "one first assigns a fitness to each node at random , according to @xmath49 and independent of all other nodes .",
    "then the fitness of each node is shifted upward by a fixed multiple of the hamming distance from  @xmath1 .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth noting that the above models are also of interest in physics in the context of so - called _ spin glasses _ @xcite . in this",
    "setting , each node of @xmath9 represents a point in the state space of all possible configurations of spins in a disordered magnet .",
    "the analogue of fitness is in this case energy , or more precisely `` energy times @xmath50 . ''",
    "accessible paths ( not necessarily from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) correspond to trajectories in which energy decreases monotonically , and which are therefore easily accessible even at zero temperature .",
    "the hoc model appears in the spin glass context as derrida s random energy model ( rem ) , and the rmf - model is a rem in an external magnetic field . for further discussion of the connection between fitness landscapes and spin glasses ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in all three models , the basic random variable of interest is the number @xmath51 of accessible paths .",
    "one thinks of @xmath1 as the starting point of some evolutionary process , and @xmath2 as the desirable endpoint .",
    "the hoc model is often referred to as a `` null model '' for evolution , since the fitnesses of all nodes other than @xmath2 are assigned at random and independently of one another .",
    "no mechanism is prescribed which might push an evolutionary process in any particular direction .",
    "the choc model is not much better , though it does specify that the starting point is a global fitness minimum .",
    "the rmf model is a very natural and simple way to introduce an `` arrow of evolution , '' since the drift factor implies that successive @xmath52 mutations will tend to increase fitness .",
    "it seems intuitively obvious that the number @xmath53 of accessible paths should , on average , be much higher in rmf than in hoc , with the choc model lying somewhere in between .",
    "one should be a little careful here , since in rmf , the node @xmath2 is not assumed to be a global fitness maximum . nevertheless , it is easy to verify that @xmath54 = 1 $ ] in hoc , @xmath54= n$ ] in choc , whereas in many situations @xmath54 $ ] grows super - exponentially with @xmath0 in rmf ; see @xcite , along with propositions [ prop : ex ] and [ vertexremovalprop ] below . of more interest , however , is the quantity @xmath55 , which is the probability of there being at least one accessible path , that is , @xmath56 .",
    "the idea here is that , as long as _",
    "some _ accessible path exists , then evolution will eventually find it .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 has been simulated in the biophysics literature . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured explicitly that @xmath58 in the hoc model , and that @xmath59 in the rmf model , when @xmath49 is a normal distribution and @xmath60 is any positive constant . in @xcite ,",
    "the choc model was simulated for @xmath61 , and the authors conjecture , if somewhat implicitly , that @xmath57 is monotonic decreasing in @xmath0 and approaches a limiting value close to @xmath62 . in @xcite , simulations were continued up to @xmath63 , and these indicated clearly that @xmath57 was not , after all , monotonic decreasing .",
    "the authors abstain from making any explicit conjecture about the limiting behavior of @xmath57 in choc .",
    "our main results below resolve all these issues .",
    "a crucial idea is to consider the following slight generalization of the choc model :    [ mo4 ] let @xmath64 $ ] . in this model ,",
    "fitnesses are assigned as in the choc model , with the exception that we set @xmath65 .",
    "hence , choc is the case @xmath66 .    for @xmath64 $ ] ,",
    "let @xmath67 denote the probability of there being an accessible path in the @xmath5-hoc model . to simplify notation below ,",
    "we define @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath67 decreases as @xmath5 increases .",

    "the above result says a lot more , however .",
    "it shows that there is a very sharp threshold at @xmath77 for the existence of accessible paths in the @xmath5-hoc model .",
    "theorem [ thm : aconstr ] will be proven in section  [ section : proofaconstr ] .",
    "we have the following immediate corollary for hoc :    let @xmath53 denote the number of accessible paths in the hoc model .",
    "then @xmath78    as @xmath67 is decreasing in @xmath5 we know that , for any @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath79 .",

    "let @xmath83 .",
    "now if the hypercube has accessible paths , then either @xmath1 has fitness at most @xmath5 , or there is an accessible path where all nodes involved have fitness at least @xmath5 .",

    "the probability of fitness being increasing along the path is @xmath86 .",
