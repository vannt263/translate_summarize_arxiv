    "the search for exotic @xmath12nucleus quasi - bound states @xcite is guided by the strong and attractive nature of the @xmath13 interaction in the @xmath14wave @xcite . with this motivation ,",
    "measurements for the @xmath15 reaction @xcite were carried out by the turin group in 1993 at an incident energy of 683 mev . a theoretical study of this reaction @xcite was made and it was summarized that the information available was not sufficient to conclude the formation of an @xmath2 quasi - bound state .",
    "the interest in this reaction has been revived by the recent sophisticated study of this reaction at the cosy laboratory at an incident energy of 673 mev @xcite . using the experience gained by studying the interaction of @xmath0 with lighter nuclei like the deuteron @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite by solving few body equations",
    ", we extend our study to a heavier nucleus , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath4 .",
    "we consider @xmath3 and @xmath4 nuclei as @xmath5 and @xmath6 clusters .",
    "the reaction mechanism is , hence , built by assuming a collision of the beam proton with the deuteron in @xmath3 producing an @xmath0 and @xmath16 . combining with the spectator @xmath17",
    ", @xmath16 produces @xmath4 in a particular state ( see fig .",
    "the production @xmath9matrix for a relative angular momentum @xmath18 between the @xmath16 and @xmath17 is written as @xmath19 is the transition form factor for @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . here ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radial wave functions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the @xmath9matrix for the elementary process , @xmath24 , is written in a two - step model from our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been carried out by neglecting the effect of fermi motion on @xmath24 .    the transition matrix for the @xmath25 reaction , including the @xmath2 fsi is given as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the initial and final momenta in the centre of mass system .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the spin projections for the proton , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 interaction is incorporated through a half - off - shell @xmath2 @xmath9matrix , @xmath32 where , @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent @xmath10 and @xmath35 scattering matrices , respectively .",
    "they are written as , @xmath36 where , @xmath37 , the initial jacobi co - ordinate , is related to the position vector , @xmath38 in the @xmath39 centre of mass system of each of the constituents by @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 with @xmath42 being the energy required for the break up of @xmath4 into @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "matrices have been calculated as in ref . [ 7 ] .    to begin with , we assume that the @xmath0-meson scatters only once from each of the @xmath4 constituents , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the required single scattering terms , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) are constructed using the factorized impulse approximation ( fia ) @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the momentum in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 centre of masses are obtained by boosting their momenta in the @xmath2 centre of mass .",
    "this includes the fermi momenta of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath4 .",
    "we have used two prescriptions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 cluster wave functions , namely ( 1 ) cluster model wave function generated using wood - saxon potential @xcite and ( 2 ) green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) variational wave function generated using urbana potential @xcite .",
    "since the energy spacing between the first four low - lying levels of the @xmath4 is very small , it is important to include the contribution from these levels . in the present calculation we consider the lowest states of @xmath4 , @xmath49 doublet split by 0.48 mev , resulting from the @xmath50 radial wave function coupled to spin @xmath51 of the @xmath16 .",
    "in fig . 2 , we show the total cross sections as a function of the excess energy . in this figure",
    "we show the plane wave results and those obtained after including the @xmath2 fsi .",
    "we find that effect of inclusion of the fsi changes the shape and the magnitude of the total cross section curve drastically . in this plot",
    "we also show sensitivity of the results to different choice of wave functions . the fsi matrix has been calculated using an @xmath52 @xmath53matrix which corresponds to @xmath54 fm .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the form factor , @xmath55 , calculated using two different models .",
    "the region between the dotted lines corresponds to the range of @xmath56 , at which @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is getting calculated .",
    "this range of @xmath56 is shown in fig . 2 by hashed region .",
    "it can be seen that two form factors differ in this region which gives rise to the difference in the total cross sections calculated using the two different wave functions .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the angular distributions for three different excess energies such that it spans region from close to threshold up to 20 mev above threshold .",
    "we show results without fsi and with fsi for cluster model wave functions .",
    "we find that even after including fsi , the angular distribution is isotropic in nature . at excess energy @xmath5719 mev , the differential cross section is @xmath571 nb / sr for low - lying states of @xmath4 resulting from the @xmath50 radial wave function , in comparison with the experimental number @xcite , _",
