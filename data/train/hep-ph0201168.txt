    "the study of heavy meson decays is important for understanding the quark mixing sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is of great help for determining the quark mixing parameters , searching for the sources of @xmath9 violation .",
    "however , the quarks in nature are not free , they are bounded in hadrons by strong interactions which are described by nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the strong interaction permeates every processes .",
    "it almost masks all the information of electroweak ( ew ) interaction .",
    "one must solve the problem of strong interaction before making any meaningful measurements of ew or quark flavor physics in experiment . solving the problem of nonperturbative",
    "qcd needs efforts in both experiment and theory . in the near future besiii and cleo - c detector",
    "will provide high precision data in charm physics including data on @xmath4 meson decays , which will provide the possibility for understanding the physics in charm sector and @xmath4 decays .",
    "it is the high time to study @xmath4 meson two - body weak decays beyond the factorization approach now @xcite . in general ,",
    "if a process happens in an energy scale where there are many resonance states , this process must be seriously affected by these resonances @xcite .",
    "this is a highly nonperturbtive effect .",
    "near the scale of @xmath4 mass many resonance states exist .",
    "@xmath4 meson decays must be affected by them seriously .",
    "after weak decays the final state particles rescatter into other particle states through nonperturbative strong interaction @xcite .",
    "this is called final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "every @xmath4 decay channels can contribute to each other through final state interactions .",
    "one can model this rescattering effect as one - particle exchange process @xcite .",
    "that is to say that the final state particles be scattered into other particle states by exchanging one resonance state existing near the mass scale of @xmath4 meson .",
    "there are also other ways to treat the nonperturbative and fsi effects in nonleptonic @xmath4 decays .",
    "the readers can refer to ref.@xcite    in this paper , we study @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 decays .",
    "we use the one - particle - exchange method to study the final state interactions in these decays .",
    "the magnitudes of hadronic couplings needed here are extracted from experimental data on the measured branching fractions of resonances decays .",
    "in addition , we introduce a strong phase for the hadronic coupling which is important for obtaining the correct branching ratios of @xmath10 decays .",
    "the coupling constants extracted from experimental data are small for @xmath11-channel contribution and large for @xmath12-channel contribution .",
    "therefore the @xmath11-channel contribution is numerically negligible in @xmath10 decays",
    ". we can safely drop the @xmath11-channel contribution in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the calculation in naive factorization approach .",
    "section iii gives the main scheme of one - particle - exchange method .",
    "section iv presents the numerical calculation and discussions .",
    "finally a brief summary is given .",
    "we start with the low energy effective hamiltonian for charm decays @xcite @xmath13 , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the wilson coefficients at @xmath16 scale , @xmath17 is the product of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and defined as @xmath18 and the current - current operators are given by @xmath19 we do not consider the contributions of the qcd and the electroweak penguin operators in the decays of @xmath0 , since their effects are small in @xmath4 decays .",
    "the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath16 scale are taken to be @xcite @xmath20    in the naive factorization approach , the decay amplitude can be generally factorized into a product of two current matrix elements and can be obtained from  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) @xmath21 where the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined as @xmath24 with the color number @xmath25 .",
    "the decay constant @xmath26 and the form factor @xmath27 take the values of 0.133 gev and 0.692 respectively . for @xmath28 dependence of the form factors ,",
    "we take the bsw model @xcite , i.e. , the monopole dominance assumption : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relevant pole mass .",
    "the decay width of a @xmath4 meson at rest decaying into @xmath31 is @xmath32 where the momentum of the @xmath33 meson is given by @xmath34^{1/2}}{2m_d}.\\ ] ] the corresponding branching ratio is @xmath35        * summary * we have studied three @xmath5 decay modes .",
    "the total decay amplitude includes direct weak decays and final state rescattering effects .",
    "the direct weak decays are calculated in factorization approach , and the final state interaction effects are studied in one - particle - exchange method . the prediction of naive factorization is far from the experimental data . after including the contribution of final state interaction , the theoretical prediction can accommodate the experimental data .",
