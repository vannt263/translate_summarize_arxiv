    "nearly 800 isolated rotation - powered neutron stars are currently known , most of them discovered through their radio pulsations ( taylor , manchester , & lyne 1993 ; taylor et al .",
    "a small fraction of these pulsars has also been detected in the optical , x - ray , and gamma - ray bands ; in some cases , this emission is also pulsed .",
    "the radiation from these objects is believed to arise from three distinct processes . in the youngest pulsars ( as estimated by their spindown age , @xmath4 yr , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pulsar s spin period and period derivative )",
    ", non - thermal emission arising from the relativistic acceleration of @xmath7 pairs in the corotating magnetosphere dominates at all wavelengths ( see romani 1996 ) . in young and middle - aged pulsars ( @xmath8 yr ) ,",
    "thermal soft x - ray emission arising from the initial cooling of the neutron star surface has been detected , in addition to non - thermal magnetospheric emission ( see gelman 1993 ) . in two nearby",
    "older pulsars ( @xmath9 yr ) , thermal soft x - ray emission is detected and is thought to arise from heating of the polar caps by returning @xmath7 pairs accelerated in the outer magnetosphere ( yancopoulos , hamilton , & helfand 1994 ; manning & wilmore 1994 ) .",
    "the other known rotation - powered pulsars are thus far detected only through their non - thermal radio emission .",
    "optical / ultraviolet emission of young and middle - aged pulsars probes both the non - thermal and thermal components and thus may provide significant constraints on theoretical models when combined with x - ray data .",
    "optical emission has been reported from directions of nine pulsars .",
    "pulsations were detected from all five pulsars for which time - resolved data are available , most recently from psr b0656 + 14 and geminga ( shearer et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) . in most cases , the optical pulsed fraction is @xmath10100% .",
    "because the intrinsically faint optical emission expected from pulsars leads to non - negligible probabilities of chance coincidence with the radio position , the detection of optical pulsations is a crucial test of a proposed counterpart .    in this paper , we report negative results of a search for optical pulsations near the radio positions of two young pulsars in the southern sky .",
    "these non - detections call into question the counterpart proposed by caraveo , mereghetti , & bignami ( 1994 , hereafter cmb94 ) for the very young psr b150958 ( @xmath11 ms , @xmath12 , @xmath13 yr ) and set the first limits on an optical counterpart for the relatively young psr b170644 ( @xmath14 ms , @xmath15 , @xmath16 yr ) . in the course of completing this work",
    ", we learned of two independent non - detections of pulsations from the proposed optical counterpart of psr b150958 ( r.  n. manchester 1997 , private communication ; mignani et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we obtained high - speed photoelectric photometry of the radio coordinates of the two young pulsars on ut 1995 may 2629 ( mjd 4986349866 ) with the 4-m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in la serena , chile .",
    "the details of the observational setup and the photometric and timing calibrations are described by chakrabarty ( 1998 ) .",
    "the night of may 26 was photometric , but sky conditions gradually deteriorated over the next several nights , with many high , thin clouds present on may 29 .",
    "our observations were made with the automated single channel aperture photometer ( ascap ) and a dry - ice - cooled varian vpm-159a photomultiplier tube at the @xmath17 ritchey - chretien focus .",
    "the varian phototube , which has an ingaasp photocathode , is sensitive over a wide wavelength range , with a quantum efficiency of 15% at 4000    and 5% at 9000   .",
    "most of the observations used the @xmath18 filter from the _ ubvri _ filter set described by graham ( 1982 ) .",
    "two of the observations used a longpass rg-610 filter , which blocks optical wavelengths shortward of 6100   .",
    "most of the observations were made through a 6.6  arcsec circular aperture , although one observation ( run 45r ) was made through a 9.2  arcsec aperture .",
    "the data were recorded at 1 ms resolution and rebinned to 10 ms resolution for timing analysis .",
    "one of the observations ( run 45r ) contained an instrumental signal at 60 hz and its higher harmonics along with another at 1.75 hz and its higher harmonics .",
    "these contaminants were restricted to a discrete set of frequencies and were easily identified .",
    "table  1 gives a log of our observations .",
    "we used the radio coordinates of the two pulsars to position our aperture ( see table 2 ) . for psr b150958",
    ", we observed the optical counterpart proposed by cmb94 , which is coincident with the radio timing position of kaspi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) within 1 arcsec . for psr b170644 , there are two new positions available due to radio timing ( wang et al .",
    "1998 ) and radio interferometry ( frail & goss 1998 ) which are essentially identical .",
    "this position is 2.7  arcsec from a relatively bright optical star , which we designate as star  1 .",
    "this and several other stars , along with the radio position , are shown in figure  1 , which is a 2-min @xmath18-band exposure of the field taken from the ctio 1.5-m telescope on 1995 may 28 .",
    "we computed an astrometric solution for this image using stellar coordinates derived from a 1987 @xmath19-band plate of the region , obtained from the stsci digitized sky survey .",
    "we observed three different positions in this field , indicated by the circles on figure  1 .",
    "the first two positions were centered on stars  1 and 2 , respectively , and used a 6.6  arcsec aperture .",
    "the third position was centered near stars  4 and 5 , and used a 9.2  arcsec aperture .",
    "only the aperture centered on star  1 included the new radio position .",
    "for each observation , the data were transformed to the solar system barycenter frame using the jet propulsion laboratory de200 solar system ephemeris ( standish et al .",
    "1992 ) , and the time series was flattened by subtracting a low - order polynomial .",
    "the pulse phases for the binned arrival times were computed according to a contemporaneous radio timing model of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the pulse phase as a function of the barycentric time @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is the epoch for the timing model ; and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the pulse frequency and its derivatives at @xmath27 .",
    "the radio timing parameters for psrs b150958 and b170644 are regularly monitored at parkes observatory in australia and are available in an electronic database maintained at princeton university .",
    "the resulting pulse phase distributions were searched for evidence of periodicity using the @xmath28-test , a sensitive statistical test for weak periodic signals of unknown pulse shape ( de jager , swanepoel , & raubenheimer 1989 ) .",
    "the chief advantages of the @xmath28-test are that it is independent of binning and that it is sensitive to a wide range of pulse shapes .",
    "we found no convincing evidence for pulsations in any of our observations .",
    "the computed probabilities for a uniform ( unpulsed ) distribution of phases are included in table 1 .",
    "we also used the background - subtracted unpulsed ( `` dc '' ) intensity to estimate a 95%-confidence upper limit on the pulsed fraction ( see de jager 1994 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "1995 , and chakrabarty 1996 for a discussion of this problem ) .",
    "these upper limits are included in table  1 .",
    "based on its radio dispersion measure and the distance model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) , psr b150958 is estimated to be 4.4 kpc distant . assuming a rough @xmath19 extinction law of @xmath29 mag kpc@xmath30 ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) , this implies an absolute magnitude of @xmath31 for the cmb94 candidate counterpart . as cmb94 pointed out",
    ", this optical luminosity far exceeds the prediction of the @xmath32 law derived by assuming synchrotron emission near the light cylinder and scaling the surface dipole magnetic field and spin period of the crab pulsar ( pacini 1971 ) .",
    "it also far exceeds an extrapolation of the pulsar s non - thermal power - law x - ray spectrum into the optical .",
    "the pacini scaling law is able to account for the optical luminosity of the other young pulsars where non - thermal emission dominates ( pacini & salvati 1987 ) , but it can not account for the older pulsars , whose optical emission is probably thermal in origin ( e.g. , shearer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , since non - thermal emission should dominate in psr b150958 , one would expect the scaling law to apply .",
    "our 2@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath33% on the optical pulsed fraction of the cmb94 candidate contrasts with the @xmath34% optical pulsed fraction observed in 4 of the 5 known optical pulsars ( see table 3 ) .",
    "only psr b054069 has a lower pulsed fraction of 16% ( boyd et al .",
    "however , this value must be regarded as a lower limit due to the uncertain contribution from the synchrotron nebula enshrouding the pulsar . at the distance of the lmc ,",
    "the 0.65 arcsec aperture used in the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observation covered a 0.16 pc region around psr b054069 ( boyd et al .",
    "1995 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the 1 arcsec aperture used in an _ hst _ observation of the much closer crab pulsar covered only 0.01 pc around the neutron star and still included a @xmath35% nebular contribution ( percival et al .",
    "therefore , the optical pulsed fraction of psr b054069 is probably considerably higher than 16% .",
    "thus the cmb94 candidate , if it were the true pulsar counterpart , would be remarkable both for its high optical efficiency and its low optical pulsed fraction .",
    "it is instructive to compute the probability of a chance optical coincidence with the radio position of psr b150958 .",
    "the density of stars with @xmath36 in the galactic plane is @xmath37 stars  deg@xmath38 ( allen 1973 ) .",
    "poisson statistics then give a probability of @xmath39% for finding an unrelated @xmath40 star within 1 arcsec of the pulsar .",
    "given its high optical luminosity , small pulsed fraction , and significant chance coincidence probability , we suggest that the cmb94 candidate is not associated with psr b150958 .",
    "deep optical spectroscopy should eventually settle the question .",
    "if it is not the true counterpart , then identification of the actual @xmath41 counterpart at such a necessarily small angular separation from the cmb94 candidate is likely impossible with ground - based observations .",
    "we can use our non - detection of pulsations from the observed stars in the psr b170644 field to place the first limits on this pulsar s optical flux .",
    "our photoelectric photometry of star  1 on may 26 yielded the following magnitude and colors : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "based on differential photometry using our @xmath18-band image of the field , we conclude that @xmath47 . given the nearby presence of star  1 , ground - based identification of this optical counterpart will also be difficult .",
    "the present optical limits are not constraining for the pacini ( 1971 ) relation , which predicts a dereddened magnitude of @xmath48 for psr b170644 .",
