    "there are many reasons to study the spin of the nucleon .",
    "an ingenuous reason is that it is interesting in itself : we are curious to know how the spin of the nucleon emerges from its constituents , i.e. , how the spins and orbital angular momenta of the quarks and gluons combine together into the spin 1/2 of the nucleon .",
    "we have also more practical reasons : spin degrees of freedom provide additional tests to theories .",
    "hence , studying spin observables provides a more complete study of the fundamental force ruling the nucleon structure , the strong force , of which the accepted gauge theory is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "we can also learn about important emergent properties of qcd , such as the mechanism of confinement , how the effective hadronic degrees of freedom stem from the fundamental partonic ones , or how well non - perturbative methods , e.g. , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) , lattice gauge theory or the gravity - gauge ( ads / cft ) correspondence , describe the strong force in its low energy domain .",
    "finally , a precise knowledge of polarized parton distributions is necessary for investigations of physics beyond the standard model or high precision atomic physics .",
    "we have thus many good reasons to be interested in the nucleon spin .    in this document",
    ", we will focus on what spin structure studies teach us about confinement , the emergence of the hadronic degrees of freedom and tests of non - perturbative approaches to qcd .",
    "due to space limits , we will discuss results based on inclusive lepton scattering , which are only a fraction of the polarized observables necessary for a full description of the nucleon spin structure .",
    "in fact , we will focus on the first moment of the spin structure function @xmath4 at low to moderate @xmath0 .",
    "these results were obtained with the 6 gev jlab accelerator .",
    "the future spin program with the new 12 gev jlab beam is discussed in v. burkert s contribution to these proceedings .",
    "inclusive polarized lepton scattering data , obtained by experiments in which the only particle of the reaction detected is the scattered lepton , is parametrized ( neglecting the weak interaction ) by four structure functions : two unpolarized ones : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and two polarized ones : @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the 4-momentum exchanged between the beam particle and the target particle ) . in the bjorken limit , @xmath12 while @xmath13 stays finite , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constructed from the quark densities @xmath16(@xmath17 ) , @xmath18(@xmath19 ) , @xmath20(@xmath21 ) ... which provide the amount of up , down , strange ... quarks ( antiquarks ) carrying a nucleon momentum fraction @xmath9 , respectively . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are simple sums of these densities : @xmath22+q_d^2[d + \\overline d]+ ... $ ] and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the electric charge of the quark of flavor @xmath25 .",
    "likewise , @xmath26 is constructed from the quark polarizations @xmath27 ... which are , for a given @xmath9 , the difference between the amount of quarks with their spins parallel to the nucleon spin and those with their spins antiparallel : @xmath28+q_d^2[\\delta d + \\delta \\overline d]+ ... $ ] in the bjorken limit the other spin structure function has no role : @xmath29 .",
    "this relatively simple picture is only valid at @xmath30 where the qcd coupling @xmath1 should vanish , i.e. in the asymptotic case where quarks are free . at finite ( but still large ) @xmath0",
    ", quarks start to interact , which leads to gluon corrections .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the target @xmath31 and effects of transverse momentum @xmath32 or transverse spin are less suppressed : @xmath33 , @xmath34 and thus , they start to play a role .",
    "this breaks down the above relations : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    at smaller @xmath0 , ( @xmath37 gev@xmath38 )",
    ", @xmath1 becomes large and the significantly stronger quark interaction induces correlations , known as higher twists ( ht ) effects , which invalidate the simple description summarized above : @xmath39+q_d^2[d + \\overline d]+ ... $ ] and @xmath40+q_d^2[\\delta d + \\delta \\overline d]+ ... $ ] . some of the ht effects that contribute to inclusive polarized scattering have been interpreted recently as the transverse confining force acting on the quarks  @xcite .",
    "ht have been measured in a number of jefferson lab ( jlab ) experiments in halls a  @xcite , b  @xcite and c  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ht were extracted in the high-@xmath9 domain in  @xcite .",
    "the sane experiment in hall c will further add to these data ( see w. armstrong s contribution to these proceedings ) .",
    "an example of ht extraction specially relevant to this document is the determination of the twist-4 element @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "it is extracted from bjorken sum measurements ( see next section ) at jlab .",
    "its absolute value at @xmath42 gev@xmath38 , @xmath43 , is large ( the scale is set by the leading twist value of the bjorken sum , @xmath44 ) .",
    "such large ht agrees with the intuition that non - perturbative effects should be large at moderate @xmath0 .",
    "however , the @xmath45 ht correction @xmath46 is small and @xmath47 is of similar magnitude as @xmath48 but of opposite sign .",
    "thus , overall the sum of ht is small near @xmath42 gev@xmath38 .",
    "this explains why ht have been so elusive , as well as the onset of hadron - parton duality  @xcite .",
    "if ht are overall small at these @xmath0 , what are their actual effects and what is their practical connection to confinement ? to answer these questions , we first need to discuss the subject of  sum rules \" .",
    "a sum rule is a rule ( i.e an equality ) that relates a sum ( i.e. , an integral such as a moment of a structure function ) to a quantity characterizing the studied particle .",
    "a relevant sum rule to this document is the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite that relates the photo - absorption cross - sections @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( 3/2 ( 1/2 ) indicates that the photon helicity is aligned ( anti - aligned ) with the target polarization ) to the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath51 of the target : @xmath52 with @xmath53 the photon energy , @xmath54 the photo - production threshold , @xmath55 the qed coupling constant and @xmath31 the target mass .",
    "originally derived for photo - production ( @xmath56 ) , the gdh sum rule has been latter generalized to @xmath57  @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a double dvcs spin ",
    "dependent amplitude .",
    "the famous bjorken sum rule for spin - dependent deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite then appears as the isovector part of the generalized gdh sum rule in the large @xmath0 limit : @xmath60 where the series coefficients and @xmath1 are expressed in the @xmath61 renormalization scheme ( rs ) , and where the @xmath62 are non - perturbative ht corrections discussed in the preceding section that become important only at low @xmath0 .",
    "data on @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , including preliminary results from experiments eg1 , eg4 and e97110 are shown in fig .",
    "the high precision of the mapping at intermediate and moderately  high @xmath0 done for the proton and the neutron at jlab can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( top plots ) .",
    "the @xmath66 moments display a strong @xmath0variation while transiting from high - to - low @xmath0 .",
    "the mapping is being finalized with the analysis of more recent experiments covering the @xmath67 domain at very low @xmath0 ( preliminary results shown on the bottom plots ) .",
    "again , the data have high precision and should test well the @xmath67 predictions . the preliminary results on low-@xmath0 measurement of the generalized gdh sum rule on the neutron(@xmath68he )",
    "are discussed in c. peng s contribution to these proceedings .",
    "we see that the recent @xmath67 results agree with the preliminary data .",
    "we can also notice the similar negative slopes for @xmath63 and @xmath64 at very low @xmath0 .",
    "this is explained by the similar absolute values of the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron ( assuming the gdh sum rule is not violated , or at least not strongly ) .",
    "consequently , these slopes mostly cancel in the bjorken sum @xmath65 , which results for this observable in a restoration of the approximate conformal behavior ( no @xmath0-dependence ) of qcd already seen at large @xmath0 .",
    "this observation is important in the context of using the ads / cft ( anti - de sitter/_conformal _ field theory ) approach to non - perturbative qcd , as we will discuss latter .",
    "other spin - dependent sum rules exist , such as the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule on @xmath69 @xcite or polarizabilities sum rules that involve higher moments of @xmath4 and @xmath69 , see c. peng , j. zhang and k. slifer contributions to these proceedings .        the high @xmath0 data have historically provided a check of qcd in its spin sector , as well as the measurement of the quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin and _via _ evolution equations a first assessment of the gluon spin contribution @xmath70 g ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the moderate @xmath0 data provide as discussed in the previous section a handle on ht .",
    "the new low-@xmath0 data test recent @xmath3pt calculations  @xcite , see c. peng and k. slifer contributions to these proceedings .",
    "we will discuss now what we learn in practice from these measurements .",
    "exploring the connection between hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom was the main goal of the jlab experiments that covered the moderate @xmath0values that bridge the hadronic and partonic domains .",
    "that is , their goal was to provide data to help developing / improving non - perturbative theoretical frameworks , and to help explain how these various theoretical frameworks are connected .",
    "we will show here how this goal was achieved .",
    "the precise mapping of low and moderate @xmath0 regions motivated :    1 .",
    "improvement at low @xmath0 on @xmath3pt calculations  @xcite , in particular to address the @xmath71 puzzle , see c. peng , j. zhang and k. slifer contributions to these proceedings ; 2 .",
    "improvement at higher @xmath0 of pqcd techniques , such as the analytic or massive perturbation theories  @xcite .",
    "these approaches essentially fold partially the ht contributions into the definition of @xmath1  @xcite in order to extend the domain of applicability of pqcd series to lower @xmath0 ; 3 .   the calculation of @xmath1 using an ads / cft duality approach  @xcite .",
    "this is this last item that we will discuss to illustrate how the jlab spin data have pushed fundamental advances in our understanding of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the light  front holographic qcd ( lfhqcd ) approximation to qcd  @xcite is based on light - front quantization , which allows a rigorous and exact formulation of non - perturbative qcd  @xcite . in particular",
    ", light - front quantization yields a relativistic schrdinger - like equation describing hadrons as quark bound - states . in principle , all elements of this equation can be determined from the qcd lagrangian ; but , in practice , it is only in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions that we know how to compute the effective confining potential entering the equation  @xcite . due to the overwhelming complexity , in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions ,",
    "the potential must be determined from other means than first - principle light - front calculations .",
    "one such method is the correspondence between gravity in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and qcd on the light - front  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence originates from the fact that the group of isometries of a 5-dimensional ads space is the conformal invariance of the dual field theory in minkowsky space , and thus encodes the scale invariance of the classical qcd lagrangian .",
    "the calculations are tractable if short - distance quantum fluctuations are neglected and if the quark masses are set to zero ( chiral limit ) .",
    "the 5-dimensional ads calculations are projected on the 4-dimensional boundary of the ads space which is identified with the physical minkowski spacetime ( hence the  holographic \" denomination ) .",
    "thus , light - front holography provides a semiclassical approximation to qcd in its long distance regime which incorporates fundamental aspects of qcd .    enforcing the conformal symmetry of qcd ,",
    "i.e that the lagrangian has no energy scale in the chiral limit , without explicitly breaking the symmetry , leads to a unique choice of potential  @xcite .",
    "it has the form of a harmonic oscillator on the light front .",
    "the uniqueness of this form is confirmed by the facts that 1 ) only this form yields a zero - mass pion in the chiral limit  @xcite ; 2 ) it explains the remarkable mass symmetry between mesons and baryons  @xcite ; 3 ) it is equivalent to the well - established linear potential for static quarks in the usual instant - form front  @xcite .",
    "hence , fundamental aspects of nonperturbative qcd are incorporated in lfhqcd which is based on the embedding of light - front relativistic bound state equations in ads space . this semiclassical approximation to qcd in its large distance domain",
    "is completely determined by the constraints imposed by superconformal algebra , a symmetry which can originate from the dynamics of color su(3 )  @xcite .",
    "the only free parameter is the scale @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , chiral qcd is independent of conventional units of mass such as mev . in other words ,",
    "a theory or model of the strong force can only predict dimensionless ratios such as the proton to @xmath73meson mass ratio @xmath74 , or @xmath75 . for lfhqcd this single parameter",
    "is denoted @xmath72 . for standard qcd ,",
    "it is @xmath2 .",
    "the relation between the two is known analytically and numerically  @xcite and was obtained _ via _ the qcd coupling @xmath1 , which we discuss next .",
    "a quantity of central interest for this article that can be determined by lfhqcd is the strong coupling @xmath1  @xcite . a particularly useful way to define",
    "it in the long distance regime is _ via _ the concept of effective charge  @xcite , which is defined from the perturbative series of an osbservable , truncated to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , with such coupling , eq .  ( [ bjorken sr ] ) becomes : @xmath76 where the subscript @xmath4 reminds us of this particular choice of definition .",
    "this choice can be viewed as equivalent to a rs choice  @xcite .",
    "one sees that with this definition , both the short distance pqcd effects ( the higher order terms in the leading twists pqcd series ) and long distance confinement effects ( the ht terms ) are now folded into the definition of @xmath1 .",
    "this is in analogy with the original coupling constant becoming a running ( effective ) coupling when short distance quantum effects are folded into its definition  @xcite .",
    "the folding of the long distance confinement effects into the coupling definition regularizes it , removing the unphysical landau pole at @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "we already mentioned how the folding of ht lead to optimized perturbative series .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 as an effective charge can be viewed as a generalization of this procedure : the role of ht or more generally the long distance confining effects is to regularize @xmath1 .",
    "the bjorken sum measurement can be used to obtain @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "the most important data are from jlab at moderate and low @xmath0 . at",
    "lower and higher @xmath0 , the gdh and bjorken sum rules , respectively , can supplement the data .",
    "the experimental data yield the coupling shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha_g1 ] .     from experimental data ( symbols ) .",
    "the data are supplemented at low @xmath0 by the gdh sum rule ( dashed line ) and at high @xmath0 by the bjorken sum rule ( band ) .",
    "the lfhqcd prediction is given by the continuous line .",
    "[ fig : alpha_g1 ] + , scaledwidth=40.0% ]        an important observation provided by the measurement of @xmath78 at low @xmath0 is that it freezes , i.e. , qcd s approximate conformal behavior is restored .",
    "( qcd is also conformal at large @xmath0 , a phenomenon called bjorken scaling ) .",
    "this allows us to apply lfhqcd at low @xmath0 .",
    "it predicts that  @xcite : @xmath79 this prediction agrees well with the data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_g1 ] .",
    "it is important to remember that there are no free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ alpha_s from lfhqcd ] ) , @xmath72 being determined by hadron masses ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_g1 ] , @xmath80  @xcite ) .",
    "the lfhqcd prediction is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_g1 ] up to @xmath81 gev@xmath38 , its expected domain of validity . at",
    "higher @xmath0 , short distance quantum effects , which are not included in the usual semiclassical approximation in lfhqcd become important and void the prediction .",
    "there , however , pqcd is available to calculate @xmath78 . in fact",
    ", the respective domains of applicability of lfhqcd and pqcd appear to overlap around @xmath81 gev@xmath38  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to match the @xmath78 computation from pqcd to that from lfhqcd , thereby relating hadronic masses to the fundamental qcd parameter @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "for example , the leading order relation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is : @xmath84 where @xmath85 , ( @xmath86 is the first coefficient of the qcd s @xmath87-series ) .",
    "numerically , @xmath88 for @xmath89 quark flavors .",
    "at n@xmath68lo the numerical relation is @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath73 meson is the ground state solution of the lfhqcd schrdinger equation , i.e. , with radial excitation @xmath91 and internal orbital angular momentum @xmath92 .",
    "higher mass states are solutions with @xmath93 and @xmath94 and are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] , together with a similar prediction for strange mesons .",
    "baryon masses can be obtained similarly or thanks to the mass symmetry between mesons and baryons  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the known value of @xmath72 can be used with the same matching procedure to predict @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to @xmath95 gev , which agrees well with the world average value of 0.339(17 ) gev  @xcite .",
    "we have reported on the low and moderate @xmath0 ( few gev@xmath38 ) nucleon spin structure measurements done at jlab , focusing on the inclusive program on the experimental side . on the phenomenology side",
    ", we focused on what this teaches us about quark confinement and the emergence of effective degrees of freedom ( hadrons ) from the fundamental ones ( quark and gluons ) .",
    "the jlab data cover an extensive kinematic range with high precision thanks to the high luminosity of the experimental equipment .",
    "they complement the data from the cern , slac and desy high energy facilities .",
    "most of the data at moderate @xmath0 are now available .",
    "remaining data from the clas eg1b and hall c sane experiments will be available soon .",
    "the analysis of the lower @xmath0 data is being finalized for the neutron , both from polarized deuteron and @xmath68he targets , and should be available early 2017 .",
    "more work remains for the low @xmath0 proton data . finally , some very low @xmath0 data ( @xmath96 gev@xmath38 ) from n  ( @xmath68he ) should become available in the upcoming years .",
    "we argued that the jlab spin sum rule program has reached its goal : it has provided a precise mapping at low , intermediate and moderately high @xmath0 and triggered advances on the theoretical front .",
    "in particular , there is good progress in the description of the strong force over the full @xmath0-range , with improvements in the chiral perturbation theory calculations ( low @xmath0 ) and pqcd series ( high @xmath0 ) .",
    "a goal for these data was to help understanding how hadronic degrees of freedom connect to partonic ones .",
    "better measurements and understanding of higher twists , as well as new approaches to the confinement problem , e.g. , from light ",
    "front holographic qcd , represent advances on this front . as examples of recent developments directly connected to the jlab spin data , we showed the extraction of the qcd coupling @xmath1 and its determination from light ",
    "front holographic qcd , whose applicability domain overlaps with that of pqcd near @xmath97 1 gev .",
    "this overlap allows the analytical determination of the hadron spectrum with @xmath2 as the only input .",
    "one parameter e.g. , @xmath2 allows one to express quantities in terms of conventional gev units . since @xmath2 is well determined , the mass spectrum prediction from light ",
    "front holographic qcd has no free parameters .",
    "obtaining such result has been the long - thought goal of the strong force studies .",
    "arguably light - front holographic qcd is not qcd , but it is a semiclassical approximation which incorporates basics aspects of nonperturbative qcd dynamics which are not apparent from the qcd lagrangian , such as the emergence of a mass scale and confinement , the existence of a zero mass particle in the chiral limit and universal regge trajectories  @xcite .",
    "hence the derivation of the strong coupling in the infrared domain and the hadron spectrum represents an important advance toward reaching this long - thought goal , and the jefferson lab spin data has played a major role in it .",
