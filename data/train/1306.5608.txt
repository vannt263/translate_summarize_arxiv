    "in the last decade , the physics of ultra - cold atoms in optical - lattice potentials has undergone extensive developments due to the extreme controllability and versality of the realizable many - body systems ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . the tight - binding description predicted in 1998 @xcite , termed bose  hubbard model ( bhm ) for bosonic atoms with contact @xmath2-wave interactions , was soon after verified via the experimental observation of the superfluid ( sf )  mott insulator ( mi ) transition @xcite . for particles interacting via a long - range ( e.g. , dipole - dipole ) potential",
    ", the original model has to be modified , typically including a density ",
    "density interaction between different sites .",
    "the simplest approximation , taking into account only the interaction between nearest neighbours , is termed the extended bose - hubbard model ( ebhm ) . as compared to the bhm",
    ", the extended model allows for the existence of novel quantum phases such as checkerboard solids , supersolid phases @xcite , exotic haldane insulators @xcite , and more .",
    "recently , however , it has been realized that even in the simpler case of contact @xmath2-wave interactions , in certain parameter regimes , carefully performed tight - binding approximations lead to an additional correlated tunneling term in the resulting microscopic description .",
    "this term , known in the case of fermions as bond - charge contribution @xcite , is even more important for bosons @xcite .",
    "it is found that such tunneling terms along with the effect of higher bands can provide an explanation @xcite of the unexpected shift in the mi ",
    "sf transition point for bose  fermi and bose - bose mixtures @xcite as well as shifts in absorption spectra for bosons in optical lattices @xcite .    one may expect that similar bond - charge ( or density - dependent tunneling ) effects may play a similarly important role in the presence of dipolar interactions .",
    "this assumption has been verified by some of us @xcite in a recent study , where it has been shown that the additional terms in the hamiltonian may destroy some insulating phases and can create novel pair - superfluid states .",
    "that study @xcite has been restricted to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model due to the numerical methods used . here",
    ", we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to study soft - core dipolar gases trapped in two - dimensional square optical lattices , where we assume a tight confinement in the remaining @xmath3 direction ( which is also the polarization direction of the dipoles ) . a similar two - dimensional model without density - dependent tunneling terms",
    "was analyzed before @xcite , providing us with a benchmark against which we may test the importance of density - dependent tunneling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a supersolid phase was observed in the ebhm at half filling .",
    "such a supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of superfluid and crystal - like density  density diagonal long - range order @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence of this counter - intuitive quantum phase is still missing , since the claim of an experimental realization of supersolidity in@xmath4he @xcite could not be reproduced in later experiments @xcite . as we shall see , in the present model , the sign of the additional tunneling ( or , more precisely , the relative sign between the standard tunneling and the density - dependent one ) can stabilize or destabilize the supersolid phases .",
    "the appropriate tight - binding model to study interacting dipolar bosons occupying the lowest band in a lattice reads @xcite @xmath5    where @xmath6 @xmath7 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a boson at site @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the number operator ; @xmath10 is the regular hopping term , @xmath0 the onsite repulsion , and @xmath11 the chemical potential .",
    "we assume a system of dipolar bosons in a 2d square lattice with dipolar moments polarized perpendicularly to the lattice , thus leading to dipole - dipole repulsion .",
    "then , the present model contains three terms that come from the dipolar interactions , the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath1 , the density - dependent hopping @xmath12 , and the correlated pair tunneling @xmath13 .",
    "we restrict here the range of @xmath1 to the nearest neighbors to allow for a direct comparison with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite within the standard ebhm , both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 terms are neglected . however , the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that , although @xmath1 is typically an order of magnitude larger than both @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the latter terms can not be neglected in the presence of strong dipolar interactions .",
    "the four parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 have the same physical origin , namely interactions , and are therefore correlated .",
    "however , in the two - dimensional model , changing the trapping frequency in the direction perpendicular to the plane affects quite strongly only the on - site @xmath0 term ( for dipolar as well as for the contact part of the interactions ) , while leaving the other three parameters practically unaffected @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall consider @xmath0 as an independent parameter . to facilitate a comparison with earlier works ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "that did not take @xmath12 tunneling into account we span a similar parameter range for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and filling fractions .",
    "the values of @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and @xmath13 are strongly correlated as they originate from nearest - neighbour scattering due to long - range interactions . for a broad range of optical - lattice depths , the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath1 are typically related as @xmath14 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath13 is almost another magnitude smaller than @xmath12 ( compare fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we will set @xmath15 in the following and neglect the @xmath13 term altogether .",
    "this will allow us to study in depth the effects due to density - dependent tunnelings .",
    "the previous study @xcite has shown that there is a broad tunability regarding the relationship of the two tunneling parameters @xmath12 and @xmath10 , allowing a regime where the two hopping terms have opposite signs , and even the exotic situation that @xmath12 dominates over @xmath10 .    whether both hopping terms are of the same or of opposite sign has a major influence on the phases that will appear in the system .",
    "generally speaking , when both hopping terms have the same sign , one can expect an increase of the influence of the overall hopping . otherwise ,",
    "if the signs are opposite , there will be a competition between the two terms .",
    "therefore , the influence of the additional density - dependent hopping can be expected to strongly affect the phase diagram .    to form an intuition about our system ,",
    "let us give a brief summary of the results from the previous study @xcite of a similar 1d system with both a density - dependent and a pair - hopping term . in that study , exact diagonalization ( system sizes between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) ( system sizes up to @xmath18 )",
    "were used to study the phase diagram at zero temperature .",
    "the results , when both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are set to zero , show the existence of three phases . at weak interaction",
    ", there is a superfluid phase ( sf ) , while at stronger dipolar strength , two charge density wave ( cdw ) phases appear .",
    "the cdw phases are characterized by a periodic , crystal - like structure where occupied and empty sites alternate in a checkerboard pattern . in the following ,",
    "we denote cases where the populated sites are occupied by a single atom ( two atoms ) as cdw i ( ii ) . in the one - dimensional case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the two observed cdw phases are a cdw i phase at half filling with a modulation of @xmath19 and a cdw ii phase at unit filling with a modulation of @xmath20 .",
    "now , when the extra terms @xmath12 and @xmath13 are incorporated into the hamiltonian , besides an overall deformation of the phase diagram , there appears also a novel pair - superfluid phase ( psf ) .",
    "this more exotic phase is characterized by a finite two - particle nn correlation function @xmath21 and a smaller non - vanishing one - particle correlation function @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , no supersolid phase has been observed in @xcite . in the present study of a 2d lattice , on the contrary",
    ", we do observe a supersolid behavior , but we do not find any indications for the existence of a psf phase .      in the analysis of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ebhm ] ) , we employ the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) code , a qmc algorithm from the alps ( algorithms and libraries for physics simulations ) project @xcite .",
    "we mainly rely on three observables .",
    "first , we study the density , @xmath23 , as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "plateaus in the corresponding graph as a function of chemical potential indicate insulating phases , such as mi or cdw phases . the employed variant of qmc works in the grand - canonical ensemble , i.e. , at fixed chemical potential .",
    "discontinuous jumps in the density as a function of chemical potential signify regions of phase separation ( ps ) in the canonical phase diagrams .",
    "namely , when the filling is fixed to a value which is not stable at any chemical potential , the system acquires the required filling only in the mean , by forming domain walls between two phases that are thermodynamically stable .    to distinguish not only different insulating phases ( mi , cdw i , and cdw ii ) , but also the superfluid ( sf ) and the supersolid phase ( ss ) , we consider two other observables . these are the structure factor and the superfluid stiffness , which we analyze both as a function of density . the structure factor is defined as @xmath24    here , @xmath25 denotes the number of lattice sites , and we focus on the wave vector @xmath26 , which corresponds to a checkerboard modulation pattern .",
    "this observable has a peak when the particles are arranged in either of the cdw phases .",
    "this will help to distinguish the mi phase from the cdw phase , which can not be done from the density graphs alone .",
    "for example , when a system is at unit filling , the structure factor is finite in the cdw ii state , whereas it vanishes in a usual mi state .",
    "the other observable is the superfluid stiffness , which can be calculated from the winding numbers of the qmc code .",
    "it is defined as @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the winding - number fluctuation of the world lines and @xmath29 is the inverse temperature ( in this study @xmath30 ) .",
    "this value shows what percent of the system is in a superfluid state .",
    "taking superfluid stiffness and structure factor together , we can also identify the ss phase .",
    "the ss phase occurs when both superfluid stiffness and structure factor are non - zero .",
    "note that , since ps regions do not correspond to stable grand - canonical phases as computed in the sse qmc code , we can not assign any values of observables for them .",
    "this is not necessary , however , since ps regions are already unambiguously identified by jumps in plots of density against chemical potential .",
    "from these three observables ( density , structure factor , and superfluid stiffness ) we are now able to distinguish the most prominent phases that we are looking for .",
    "these observables can not , however , identify psf phases , the signature of which is , as mentioned previously , a non - vanishing two - particle nn correlation function @xmath31 . in its current version ,",
    "the qmc code provided in the alps library is not able to calculate these correlation functions . in order to extract this observable",
    ", the code would have to be written with a two - headed worm , which could then be analyzed in a similar way as the superfluid stiffness , but with the difference that the winding numbers would represent the flowing of pairs instead of single particles @xcite .",
    "fortunately , one can identify a dominant psf order parameter using a different technique , namely by studying the density histograms of the qmc code .",
    "if these histograms show only even values of particles instead of a uniform distribution , this means that the bosons always pair up , indicating psf behavior @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present our qmc results for the ground - state phase diagram of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ebhm ] ) . we focus on a two - dimensional square lattice with linear system sizes ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 ) .",
    "we present phase diagrams at two different values of the on - site repulsion ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) for varying density and @xmath12 ( and therefore for varying @xmath1 , since @xmath37 ) .",
    "the two @xmath0 values are chosen in such a way that we can compare nearly hard - core like behavior , achieved at @xmath35 , with soft - core behavior , for @xmath36 .",
    "further , at @xmath35 we can compare our data to known results of the usual ebhm , which was studied thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "we compare phase diagrams obtained with and without density - dependent tunnelings .",
    "for simplicity and ease of comparison to @xcite , we restrict our study to unit filling or less .",

    "a system in a checkerboard phase ( cdw i ) can be doped by holes or particles .",
    "when it is doped with holes , these create domain walls and cause the system to phase separate , preventing the appearance of a ss phase . in the case of hardcore bosons , this behavior would be mirrored for @xmath44 , due to particle  hole symmetry . in the case of soft - core bosons , such particle ",

    "( b ) when @xmath12 and @xmath10 are of opposite sign , the role of interactions is enhanced , leading to increased ps regions and again the cdw i phase is present.,title=\"fig : \" ]      in the previous section , we saw that the additional density - dependent tunneling term @xmath12 can increase or decrease the effective importance of the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , depending whether it competes with or supports the single - particle tunneling @xmath10 . in this section ,",
    "we study this effect for weaker on - site interaction @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams are presented in fig .",
    "[ figu5 t ] .",
    "the positive-@xmath12 diagram reveals that the cdw i phase , present for @xmath38 , disappears completely ( fig .",
    "[ figu5t]a ) .",
    "this means that at no point does there exist a plateau in the density graphs at @xmath59 .",
    "instead , a discontinuity bypasses half filling altogether .",
    "the rest of the behavior is rather similar to the system without the density - dependent term .",
    "there are still only three phases below unit filling , i.e. , the sf phase at low densities and @xmath12 ( and therefore at low @xmath1 ) , the ps region near half filling for larger @xmath12 , and finally the ss phase for still higher @xmath12 and larger densities .",
    "as can be expected , when the sf phase persists through the entire range of densities , the system ends in a mi state at unit filling . instead , when the system at fixed @xmath1 passes through the ss state , the final phase at unit filling is , as before , the cdw ii phase .",
    "consider now the phase diagram of a system with @xmath36 when the tunneling terms have opposite signs ( fig .",
    "[ figu5t]b ) . here , contrary to the case of positive @xmath12 ,",
    "the cdw i exists at half filling .",
    "this indicates that the relative importance of the effective total tunneling is suppressed for @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , now a second region of ps appears above half filling . as a result , for @xmath78 there is no stable phase with a density between the cdw i and the cdw ii .     and",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( left to right ) .",
    "the bottom row shows the structure factor ( blue circles ) and the superfluid stiffness ( red squares ) for the same parameters , title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath69 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( left to right ) . the bottom row shows the structure factor ( blue circles ) and the superfluid stiffness ( red squares ) for the same parameters , title=\"fig : \" ]    these observations about the phase diagram are supported by an analysis of cuts at a few chosen values of @xmath12 ( and thus @xmath1 ) , see fig .",
    "[ cutt5 ] . at @xmath69 ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "one observes a smooth density increase all the way until unit filling , where a plateau appears ( fig .  [ cutt5]a ) .",
    "the structure factor starts increasing near half filling , indicating the transition from the sf to the ss phase ( fig .",
    "[ cutt5]d ) ; at unit filling , the system lands in the cdw ii phase .",
    "a cut at the slightly higher absolute value @xmath79 ( @xmath81 ) reveals a plateau at half filling ( cdw i ) and a second one at unit filling ( cdw ii ) . comparing the density plot ( fig .",
    "[ cutt5]b ) with those of superfluid stiffness and structure factor ( fig .",
    "[ cutt5]e ) , we see that upon increasing the chemical potential the sf phase appears at low densities , followed by the ps which transitions into the cdw i at half filling . for higher densities",
    ", there is a region of ss , where both structure factor and superfluid stiffness are non - zero . finally , there is the jump caused by the ps region directly to the cdw ii phase at unit filling .",
    "let us finally consider stronger density - dependent tunneling @xmath12 and inter - site repulsion @xmath1 , namely @xmath80 ( @xmath82 ) . below half filling , the density gradually increases up to the value of @xmath83 and then jumps to the cdw i phase ( fig .",
    "[ cutt5]c ) . after this phase",
    ", the density behaves step - like , jumping directly into the cdw ii phase at @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior is seen clearly in the data presented in fig .",
    "[ cutt5]f , where the sf phase for low densities is followed by two distinct regions of ps .",
    "these regions are only interrupted by the cdw i phase at half filling and the cdw ii phase at full filling .",
    "as these results show , for the lower on - site interaction @xmath36 , the density - dependent term @xmath12 does not change much the overall behavior of the phase diagram if it has the same sign as the single - particle tunneling @xmath10 .",
    "instead , if the two tunneling terms have opposite sign , a large part of the ss phase disappears into a phase - separated region , due to the increased relative importance of the interaction terms .",
    "in summary , we have studied the extended bose  hubbard model on a square lattice with additional terms coming from density - dependent tunnelings .",
    "taking these terms into account is relevant for experiments on ultracold dipolar molecules in optical lattices .",
    "the competition between the density - dependent tunneling , a standard single - particle hopping , finite on - site repulsion , and nearest - neighbor repulsion gives rise to a rich phase diagram of the system .",
    "specifically , as has been found previously @xcite , at large on - site repulsion and without density - dependent tunneling , there are mott - insulator , charge - density wave , superfluid , and supersolid phases , as well as phase - separated parameter regions .",
    "depending on the parameter strengths , this phase diagram undergoes considerable deformations .",
    "if either we reduce on - site repulsion or introduce density - dependent tunnelings that have the same sign as the single - particle hopping , some of the phase - separated regions disappear .",
    "remarkably , if we introduce both of these effects simultaneously , additionally the charge density wave at half filling disappears . in this case of same - sign tunnelings ,",
    "both hopping processes act constructively producing an effective larger tunneling , or respectively , weaker interactions .",
    "we have also studied the phase diagram when the density - dependent tunneling and single - particle hopping compete due to the their signs being opposite . due to this competition , the relative importance of interaction terms is enhanced . in this case ,",
    "the most striking effect is the disappearance of the supersolid into a phase - separated region .",
    "this occurs on the particle - doped side of the half - filling charge density wave , and at strong @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to similar models in one dimension @xcite , we find no indications for pair - superfluid behavior for all considered parameter values .",
    "besides a theoretical interest in understanding how density - dependent tunneling terms change phase diagrams of extended bose ",
    "hubbard models , our findings will help to determine where one may expect exotic phases in experiments with ultracold dipolar molecules in optical lattices .",
