    "thermodynamic properties of materials are often discussed in terms of the quasiharmonic approximation.@xcite this theory has a solid foundation , but it is not without limitations . any property that relies on phonon lifetimes and scattering rates , such as thermal conductivity ,",
    "is unavailable .",
    "for those properties one needs terms higher than second order in the taylor expansion of the crystal potential energy surface .",
    "if the higher order terms are known , there is extensive theory developed for the properties that can be extracted.@xcite the difficulties lie in determining these parameters .",
    "density functional theory gives one access to the potential energy surface .",
    "perturbation theory and the @xmath1 theorem , or direct supercell approaches can be used to determine materials force constants.@xcite in these formalisms , however , the potential energy surface is treated as constant with respect to temperature .",
    "we have previously shown that this is not the case.@xcite in our previous , using the temperature dependent effective potential ( tdep ) , we obtain the best possible second order hamiltonian as a fit to the born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics potential energy surface at finite temperature . with this technique",
    "it is possible , for example , to accurately describe solid @xmath2he , which is strongly anharmonic , with a second order hamiltonian .",
    "the effective potential gives accurate phonon dispersion relations and free energies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the tdep formalism to include higher order terms , making the technique suitable for calculations of important materials properties such as phonon lifetimes .",
    "we start with a model crystal hamiltonian : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the potential energy , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the second and third order force constants .",
    "the displacement of atom @xmath7 from ideal positions is denoted @xmath8 , momentum of at and @xmath9 are cartesian indices .",
    "bold symbols indicate vectors and doubly overlined symbols matrices or tensors respectively .    the basic idea of the generalized tdep is to use born - oppeheimer molecular dynamics to accurately sample the potential energy surface at finite temperature .",
    "then we fit the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq : harmhamiltonian ] to this surface .",
    "this is done by comparing the forces of the model and the _ ab initio _ system at each time step and minimizing the difference .    with the vast number of values to be determined for the third order force constants it is crucialfor the generalization of the tdep to higher order terms to make use of the symmetry analysis.@xcite we begin by reiterating the symmetry relations the force constants obey,@xcite first the transposition symmetries : @xmath10 then ,",
    "if two tensors are related by symmetry operation @xmath11 the components are related as follows : @xmath12 force constants also obey the acoustic sum rules : @xmath13 to apply symmetry relations - , we set each tensor component to a symbolic variable , called @xmath14 .",

    "[ eq : firstsym][eq : lastsym ] we figure out which tensor components that are equal , related to each other or 0 by symmetry .",
    "this drastically reduces the number of values that have to be determined . with the symmetry irreducible representation at hand , we express the forces in the model hamiltonian : @xmath17 evaluating analytically allows of to express the forces as a function of the symmetry inequivalent components @xmath14 : @xmath18 here @xmath19 , the coefficient for each @xmath14 is a polynomial function of all displacements within @xmath16 .",

    "then , we seek the @xmath27 that minimize the difference between the model system and the _ ab initio _ one : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the number of time steps in the molecular dynamics , and subscript @xmath30 denotes the displacements and forces from time step @xmath30 .",
    "a least square solution , @xmath31 gives the @xmath23 that minimizes these forces .",
    "then , with a simple substitution back into @xmath32 and @xmath33 we determine the quadratic and cubic force constants .",

    "[ fig : fesigrun ] .",
    "the lifetimes are decreased significantly , across the whole spectrum .",
    "the temperature parameter used when evaluating lifetimes was fixed at 400k , the only difference comes from the temperature dependence of the force constants .",
    "this is consistent with experimental results,@xcite where they see a strong suppression of phonon linewidths below 250k .",
    "due to the overestimation of the band gap in dft , the closing of the gap occurs at a higher temperature in simulations ( it is not fully closed until 1200k@xcite ) , but the effect on the phonon linewidths and dispersions is qualitatively correct .",
    "this tells us that to accurately describe the phonon - phonon interactions of fesi at finite temperature , one needs to take the temperature dependence of the potential energy surface into account .",
    "we have presented an extension of our existing formalism to calculate temperature dependent third order force constants .",
