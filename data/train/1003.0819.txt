    "the functional renormalization group approach to correlated fermion systems has been of great help to detect different types of instabilities and collective order within many different models .",
    "this holds , in particular , for the two - dimensional hubbard model which is hoped to improve our understanding of superconductivity in the high-@xmath1-cuprates.@xcite most studies presented so far rely on the flow of the momentum - dependent four - fermion vertex .",
    "( for analogous work on four - quark vertices see @xcite . )",
    "they are performed in the so - called @xmath2-patch scheme where the fermi surface is discretized into @xmath2 patches , and the angular dependence of the fermionic four - point function is evaluated only for one momentum on each directional patch .",
    "the approach presented here is based on the introduction of fermionic bilinears corresponding to different types of possible orders ( partial bosonization ) that was developed and used before in @xcite .",
    "it is also inspired by the efficient parametrization method for the fermionic four - point vertex proposed in @xcite .",
    "the link between the two approaches is given by the fact that different channels of the fermionic four - point function , defined by their ( almost ) singular momentum structure , correspond to different types of possible orders which are described by different composite bosonic fields .",
    "the advantages of our method are , first , that it allows one to treat the complex momentum dependence of the fermionic four - point function in an efficient , simplified way , involving only a small number of coupled flow equations and second , that it permits to follow the renormalization group flow into phases of broken symmetry",
    ". a comparative disadvantage may be a better resolution of contributions from many channels in the @xmath2-patch approach .",
    "( in principle , both approaches can be combined . ) in this paper we focus on the first of these two aspects .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking was already addressed for antiferromagnetism ( af ) @xcite in the hubbard model close to half filling and for @xmath3-wave superconductivity in an effective hubbard - type model with a dominating coupling in the @xmath3-wave channel.@xcite        the main idea behind partial bosonization , namely , to represent the fermionic four - point vertex by a certain number of exchange bosons , is graphically shown in fig .",

    "the dependence of the four - point vertex on three external frequencies and momenta ( or simply `` momenta '' , as we are going to write for short ) is parametrized in terms of bosonic propagators together with yukawa couplings which describe the interaction between one boson and two fermions .",
    "the different bosonic channels are distinguished according to the structure of their momentum dependence which may possibly become singular due to a zero of the inverse boson propagator .",
    "the momentum - independent part of the four - fermion vertex may either be distributed onto the different bosonic channels or be kept fixed as a purely fermionic coupling . in order to avoid the arbitrariness",
    "encountered when one chooses the first of these two options , we adopt the second for our computations .",
    "this may be regarded as a prototype for a combination of partial bosonization with the @xmath2-patch method in the sense of keeping only one patch and setting the four - fermion coupling to a constant value .",
    "although for a numerically exact treatment of the four - fermion vertex an infinity of bosonic fields would have to be considered in principle , a small number of well - chosen fields may suffice for a reasonable quantitative precision .",
    "the choice of fields that has to be included in order to capture the relevant physics depends on the model under investigation . in the case of the two - dimensional hubbard model at small next - to - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath4 , a magnetic boson @xmath5 and a @xmath3-wave cooper pair boson @xmath3 are needed because they correspond to the instabilities that occur . in order to avoid a too poor momentum resolution of the four - fermion vertex",

    "most existing studies using the framework of the fermionic functional renormalization group focus on the flow of the four - fermion vertex , as we do in the present work , so we can compare our results with theirs .",
    "the most recent results for the phase diagram of the two - dimensional hubbard model at varying @xmath134 and fixed @xmath139 , presented in @xcite , are obtained by means of an @xmath2-patch scheme restricted to the flow of the four - fermion vertex .",

    "there is also agreement on the fact that @xmath3-wave superconductivity , when its coupling is enhanced most strongly , competes mostly with incommensurate rather than commensurate antiferromagnetism ( caf ) as the dominant instability .",
