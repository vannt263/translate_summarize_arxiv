    "<S> a new route to @xmath0 magnetism is established with help of the first principles methods . </S>",
    "<S> non - magnetic elements in groups 13 and 14 of the periodic table are found to act as the magnetic centers upon embedding in polycrystalline @xmath1-pbo structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the local magnetic moment is generated on the impurity site ( 1.0@xmath2 and 2.0@xmath2 for elements in group 13 and 14 , respectively ) due to @xmath3-orbitals partially filled with electrons whose on - site spin ordering is governed by the first hund s rule . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic interactions between impurities are controlled by occupation of the @xmath3-orbitals such as antiferromagnetic ordering ( afm ) occurs between impurities of 2.0@xmath2 while ferromagnetic ( fm ) between impurities possessing 1.0@xmath2 . in respect to the strength of the magnetic interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic radius of impurity is found to be a key to tune the wave function tails of localized electrons : with reduction of the atomic radius the on - site stability of the spin polarized state grows while losing in the long - rang order interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that a suppression of the long - rang order interactions can be compensated by higher impurity concentration that is allowed by shift of the solubility limit to higher magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1.5truecm    the research on magnetic semiconductors has intensified in recent years due to requirements imposed by the rapidly developing field of spintronics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> originally , magnetic semiconductors were created by doping of the conventional semiconductors with magnetic ions whose @xmath4 or @xmath5 orbitals are partially filled @xcite . the enormous attention given to so - called `` diluted magnetic semiconductors '' has been rewarded with the discovery of a mechanism of the intrinsic magnetism in semiconductors - defect - induced magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> initially , in the semiconductors doped with magnetic ions , the intrinsic defects were considered only to mediate the magnetic coupling between localized spins occupying the partially filled @xmath4 or @xmath5 orbitals of ions thus contributing to the collective magnetism effect @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , a better understanding of the defect properties has revealed that the defects with their @xmath6 localized spins are able to generate the magnetic phenomenon themself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of defect - induced magnetism dubbed as @xmath0 magnetism , i.e. magnetism which occurs not due to partially filled @xmath4 orbitals , brought new impetus into field of magnetic semiconductors and more importantly in spintronics .    in order to pursue the spintronics applications , </S>",
    "<S> the collective magnetic ordering is required to be established between the magnetic centers provided the spin - polarization energy of the localized state is large enough for the local magnetic moment to appear above the room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the local magnetic moment is defined by the impurity wave function localization that unfortunately results in suppression of its tails thus precluding the collective ordering . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , success of @xmath0 magnetism in spintronics is recognized to be defined by the proper combination of defect / host @xcite enabling both components . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> the weak magnetic interactions between the magnetic centers can be compensated by their high concentration @xcite . however , raising a defect concentration is not always a straightforward solution @xcite . for those defects known to induce magnetism : the vacancy @xcite and substitutional defects @xcite , the low limit to the defect concentration even at the most favorable growth conditions is often applied as defined by their formation energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , defects especially in high concentration are not always mechanically tolerated by the crystal lattice , not to mention that the defect - induced lattice perturbation may lead to unwanted changes in the electronic properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an idea of intrinsic magnetism requires some efforts to bring it to a level of practical applications .    </S>",
    "<S> our recent finding of new route to @xmath0 magnetism offers an elegant solution and , therefore , promises a breakthrough in development of magnetic semiconductor @xcite . instead of crystalline systems , </S>",
    "<S> the layered materials are proposed to be applied as the semiconductor host . in crystalline solids , </S>",
    "<S> the vacancies only have been considered to establish @xmath0 magnetism @xcite because the formation energy of other defects is too high to reach the concentrations required for the magnetic percolation to occur . in respect to the layered systems , </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial defects become a feasible source of unpaired electrons because they are incorporated between layers that significantly lowers their formation energy . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider the polycrystalline @xmath1-pbo to be semiconductor host for @xmath0 magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the pb interstitial defect in @xmath1-pbo induces the local magnetic moment of 2.0 @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the local magnetic moment upon bonding of the impurity with the host is unique ; the pb interstitial of pb@xmath7:@xmath8 valence shell utilizes its only pb@xmath7:@xmath9 electrons to be attached to the host ( through pb:@xmath9 electrons as well ) while leaving two unperturbed @xmath10 electrons on the defect site . </S>",
    "<S> the hund s rule dictates the spin alignment of the @xmath10 electrons ( the triplet ground state ) that manifests in on - site magnetic moment of 2.0 @xmath2 and provides the high stability of the spin polarized state defined by the spin - polarization energy @xmath11=0.235 ev @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the pb atom gains magnetization upon embedding as the interstitial defect into the @xmath1-pbo crystal lattice ( an appearance of the magnetic moment is verified experimentally @xcite ) . in analogy with magnetic ions </S>",
    "<S> , magnetism occurs due to partially filled orbitals , but here it is due to the @xmath3 orbital .    </S>",
    "<S> the unique mechanism of bonding which utilizes only @xmath12 valence electrons allow to extend a choice of host and the impurity to several candidates . because family of the @xmath1-pbo lattice shows the lone pair @xmath12 valence shell electrons as a common feature , in principal any of those systems can be used as the host . in fact , @xmath1-pbo crystal structure is well recognized in superconductivity @xcite : fe - pnistides ( basics are fese , feas ) , cuprate ( basics are cuo , cus ) , and lanthanum compounds ( basics are laf , lao ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , among others the @xmath1-pbo compound is seems to be the best candidate due to its wide band gap . for the wide band systems , impurity induces the localized defect states inside the band gap which location may vary with impurity choice . </S>",
    "<S> any chemical elements possessing partially filled @xmath3 valence shell can gain magnetic properties upon embedding into the @xmath1-pbo crystal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , elements of the same valence shell as pb atom , i.e. belonging to group 14th of the periodic table ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1](b ) ) , are expected to induce the local magnetic moment 2.0@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> following the same principal , the chemical elements of @xmath13 valence shell from group 13 of the periodic table would work as magnetic centers characterized by the local magnetic moment 1.0@xmath2 . since we can expect both , a difference in the atomic radius of impurity and occupation of the @xmath3 orbital , to control the magnetic behavior , focus is on possibility to tune magnetism with different impurities looking for a proper combination impurity / host allowing to reach d@xmath14 ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> if our hypothesis is proven true , this approach can open a wide perspective to design the desired magnetic behavior in the @xmath1-pbo semiconductor by generating a network of the interstitial defects acting as the magnetic centers . </S>",
    "<S> the feasibility to generate such network is considered through the thermodynamics of the defect formation .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the @xmath1-pbo crystal structure which contains the impurity interstitial atom . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the list of impurities from group 13 and 14 in periodic table used by us to create the local magnetic moment @xmath15=1.0@xmath2 and @xmath15=2.0@xmath2 , respectively ( the atomic number on the top and the standard atomic weight at the bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the pb self - interstitial : the spin density map is plotted with isovalues of @xmath160.003 e / @xmath17 in xcrysden for the energy range ( @xmath18)@xmath160.15 ev . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates alignment of electrons at the impurity site for which defect tails can be traced up to the last oxygen atom shown . ]    in our study we applied the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the pbe parametrization @xcite provided by wien2k package for the density functional calculations @xcite ( augmented plane wave + local orbitals approach ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pb:@xmath19 and o:@xmath20 electrons have been treated as the valence electrons ( the energy cutoff was -8 ry ) . the supercell approach ( rkmax=7 ) with sufficiently large supercell of 108-atom size ( 3@xmath213@xmath213 array of the primitive unit cells ) has been used for single impurity calculation while the 190-atom size ( 4@xmath214@xmath213 ) supercell for the interacting defects . for integration of the brillouin - zone , the monkhorst - pack scheme of the 5@xmath215@xmath214 ( or 4@xmath214@xmath212 ) k - mesh was applied . in application to the unpaired electrons , gga often fails to perform the localization of the defect wave function due to an electron self - interaction error @xcite that has been examined here with the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach applied directly to the unpaired electrons . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is known that when the band gap size is underestimated by gga , the hole - carrying impurity orbital may appear above the bottom of the conduction band thus inducing the spurious long - range order interactions @xcite . for the lattice parameters optimized with gga , </S>",
    "<S> the band gap is 1.8 ev ( very close to the experimental value @xcite ) while it found to shrink by 0.22 ev when the experimental lattice parameters are considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such gap deviation originates as a result of the interlayer distance mismatch to occur upon lattice optimization performed with gga @xcite . since in the @xmath1-pbo crystal structure </S>",
    "<S> the band gap size is controlled by the interlayer interactions of the pb:@xmath9 electrons , application of gga to optimization of the lattice parameters through overestimation of the interlayer distance causes the band gap to increase . in order to prevent the `` spurious '' effect , </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the electronic property are performed for the lattice parameters optimized with gga as it gives the better agreement of the band gap size with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> on other hand , to preclude the defect formation energies to be underestimated , the experimentally determined interlayer distance has been used for those calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies of the interstitials have been evaluated for the vacuum conditions ( details on the formation energy simulations are presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .     </S>",
    "<S> the band diagram for the @xmath1-pbo crystal structure containing the pb self - interstitial defect : @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the bands formed by the @xmath3-localized electrons pb:@xmath24 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the antibonding orbitals of the im - pb bond @xcite . ]    in respect to origin of the local magnetic moment in the @xmath1-pbo compound on site of the pb interstitial @xcite , our study had revealed that the pb interstitial combines the advantages of the vacancies @xcite and magnetic ions @xcite . the high spin - polarization energy is observed for pb interstitial due to the spin ordering of @xmath24 to be governed by the hund s rule as for magnetic ions . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time a hybridization of impurity state with the host lattice results in the extended defect tails promising to induce the long - range order interactions . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](c ) , the defect tails appear in upper and lower layers , they are extended up to seven nearest - neighbors and show the higher spin localization at the oxygen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> although the impurity interacts with the top layer through bonding while with bottom layer only through the hybridization interactions , the defect tails are observed to be more pronounced at the bottom layer . </S>",
    "<S> it occurs because the pb interstitial is tightly sandwiched between layers that results in its strong hybridization with the bottom layer .    </S>",
    "<S> the redistribution of the spin density from pb interstitial site to the host lattice explains the on - site stability of the triplet state ( @xmath11=0.235 ev ) to be lowered in comparison to the magnetic impurities of @xmath4 or @xmath5 types @xcite known to exhibit the localized nature of the unpaired electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a hybridization with the host to be a key to tune the magnetic behavior when the atomic radius of the impurity is reduced . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we track an alteration in the electronic properties of the host upon replacement of the pb interstitial with different impurities through a behavior of the impurity associated bands depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands are those induced by @xmath3-localized electrons ( the spin - up band @xmath22 is occupied by @xmath3 electrons from the impurity valence shell , while spin - down band @xmath23 is empty ) , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands are antibonding orbitals of the impurity - host bond ( im - pb ) . </S>",
    "<S> an appearance of all four bands inside the band gap upon changing the impurity type is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ( absence of @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands is referred to the antibonding orbitals outside of the band gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> other important parameters such as impurity atomic radius @xmath27 , length of the impurity - host bond </S>",
    "<S> im - pb , spin - polarization energy @xmath11 and splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands ( @xmath28 ) are disclosed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the common trends on formation of the local magnetic moment as a function of the impurity atomic radius are investigated based on elements from group 14 with @xmath29 valence shell generating the local magnetic moment 2.0@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that reduction in atomic radius of impurity leads to shift of both impurity bands @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath22 is occupied by two electrons ) towards the valence band ( @xmath30 ) but in the same time the gradual enhancement of the splitting of these bands occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 band is also shifted towards the lower energy due to shortening of the im - pb bond , while the energetic position of the @xmath26 band deviates in narrow energy range . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands ( see ( @xmath28 ) in table  [ tab : table1 ] ) indicates a gain in stability of the spin - polarized state and , indeed , a raise in the spin - polarization energy @xmath11 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for the si and c impurities which electronic interactions with the bottom layer are reduced because of shortening of the im - pb bond , the on - site stability already approaches the magnitudes known for the magnetic ions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spin - orbit coupling ( + so ) on the defect bands splitting has been investigated with gga+so for the heavier elements ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that for pb impurity the spin - orbit coupling breaks degeneracy of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 levels resulting in their splitting by 0.52 ev . </S>",
    "<S> although , such large splitting is responsible for reduction of ( @xmath28 ) , the triplet state remains stable that is confirmed by exhibition of the local magnetic moment in experiment at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit effect is less pronounced for the sn impurity for which the spin - orbit splitting is reduced to 0.19 ev . for elements with smaller atomic radius , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling can be neglected : it is 0.07 ev for ge atom and decreases further down for impurities of smaller radius .    </S>",
    "<S> we also have examined an effect of the electron self - interaction error @xcite on magnetic behavior of the pb impurity through application of the hf approach directly to the unpaired electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - polarization energy is found to increase more than twice to @xmath11=0.490 ev as a result of enhancement of the splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands to 1.12 ev : the @xmath22 orbital is shifted towards the valence band while @xmath23 towards the conduction band by @xmath31 0.4 ev each . </S>",
    "<S> however , the opposite effect is observed when the experimental lattice parameters are taken into account because a reduction in the interlayer distance results in enhancement of impurity hybridization with the opposite host layer . </S>",
    "<S> when both are applied , the compensation effect is developed causing a reduction of the band splitting to ( @xmath28)=0.68 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this value is very close to that found with gga ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) that indicates the reliability of gga for this task .    </S>",
    "<S> the chemical elements from group 13 in the periodic table are also found to be able to act as the magnetic impurity forming the local magnetic moment 1.0@xmath2 induced by @xmath3 electron occupying the @xmath13 valence shell . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands appears in the conduction band , they are not presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to @xmath29 impurities , the @xmath22 orbital occupied by single unpaired electron is found to appear very close to the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the significant defect wave function delocalization and , therefore , much weaker splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the in atom possesses almost zero splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the expected growth of ( @xmath28 ) is observed for the ga impurity for which splitting reaches 0.17 ev . because of small splitting , electron from @xmath22 leaks to @xmath23 inducing reduction of the local magnetic moment to 0.96@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling effect is weakly pronounced for the ga impurity causing a negligible reduction of ( @xmath28 ) by 0.015 ev . </S>",
    "<S> although further increase in the splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands has been expected for the al impurity , the modification of the bonding mechanism has discontinued such trend . </S>",
    "<S> the al atom is attached to the pb atom from the bottom layer instead of top layer shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it results in shift of the im - pb bonding orbital from valence band into the band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands is found to decrease to 0.13 ev that induces a further reduction of the local magnetic moment to 0.78@xmath2 . for the b atom as the magnetic impurity , </S>",
    "<S> a suppression of the ( @xmath28 ) is even stronger leading to disappearance of the local magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for new bonding mechanism , the opposite trend is observed : the spin - polarization energy @xmath11 defining the stability of the local magnetic moment decreases with reduction of the atomic radius . the general conclusion , among chemical elements from group 13 in the periodic table only ga impurity promises some advantages for d@xmath14 magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab : table1 ] the stability of the spin - polarized state determined within gga calculation as a function of impurity atomic radius @xmath27 @xcite : the spin - polarization energy @xmath11 and the energy splitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands ( @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> im - pb is a length of the bond to be formed between impurity and the host . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in respect to formation energy of defect , reduction in the atomic radius of impurity leads to less distortion within the @xmath1-pbo crystal structure : in order to accommodate the pb interstitial the layers of the host move apart while for impurity of smaller radius the interlayer distance is preserved . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we have observed a reduction of the defect formation energy : 1.23 ev is found for pb interstitial ( for details on calculation of the formation energy see @xcite ) , 0.79 ev for the sn impurity , just above zero for ge , si and ga , and it is becoming negative for c impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the low formation energy promises not only the better mechanical tolerance of the host lattice to defects but also the higher finite defect concentration to be reached . </S>",
    "<S> thus , thermodynamically granted defect concentration for the negative formation energy can be as high as number of the sites available for bonding @xmath31@xmath32 @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies are found to drop down when impurity is placed on surface of single crystal that opens a way to perform a doping of the nearest - neighbors sites ( for example by almost 1.0 ev for the pb interstitial @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the impurity of small atomic radius shows a better on - site stability of the local magnetic moment and the low formation energy , but stronger localization of the defect wave function implies shorter defect tails that would influence the long - order interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the collective magnetic ordering may only occur when two impurities are close to each other to establish the magnetic coupling of their localized spins . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> the long range order interactions play the essential role . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic coupling between impurities has been simulated for the system containing two interstitials of @xmath29 valence shell . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 electrons localized on impurities have been aligned on - site , while their inter - site ordering has been switched from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic in order to evaluate @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 state is exactly half filled and , therefore , if the localized electrons of two interacting impurities are ferromagnetically coupled ( the total magnetic moments is 4 @xmath2 ) , the inter - site virtual hopping is not allowed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the virtual hopping is supported only for afm coupling ( the total magnetic moment for two interacting impurities is zero ) and because it lowers the total energy , afm becomes the ground state . for two pb interstitials placed on distance 4.0 we found that @xmath36=-0.96 ev ( a negative sign indicates the afm ground state ) while for two interacting c interstitials it is reduced to @xmath37=-0.38 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic interactions and the magnetic coupling between defects exponentially decrease with defect separation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for two defects placed on a distance 12.5   ( for this calculation the size of the supercell was 4@xmath214@xmath213 ) , the energy difference between afm and fm states is drastically supressed to @xmath36=-0.0056 ev and @xmath37=-0.0023 ev for the pb and c interstitials , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these data prove that the larger is the atomic radius of impurity , the stronger is the hybridization of the impurity state with the host lattice being responsible for extension of the defect tails . to establish the magnetic percolation , a reduction in the inter - impurity coupling to occur for the impurities of smaller atomic radius </S>",
    "<S> can be compensated by the impurity concentration which can be increased due to a shift of the thermodynamic limit of defect formation to the higher magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , since the c interstitial possesses the negative formation energy , potentially it can be induced on the nearest - neighbouring sites . </S>",
    "<S> for this case , the theoretical limit of the exchange interaction strength defined by @xmath37=-0.38 ev can be achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> although the impurities of @xmath29 valence shell show the interesting physics , but their inter - site afm ordering and appearance of the defect states deep inside the band gap ( the coupling of the impurity state to the band like state is essential to support the spin - polarized carrier transport ) make them inappropriate for spintronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> the impurities from group 13 have a better fit to the requirements imposed by spintronics : the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands both couples to the conduction band and the fm ground state should be granted for interacting impurities . since the ga impurity has shown the highest potential due to its high spin - polarization energy , here we focus on development of the magnetic interactions between two ga impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for two defects placed on a distance 4.0  , the strength of the magnetic coupling is defined by @xmath38=1.08 ev ( a positive sign indicates the fm ground state ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between impurities has been increased twice that corresponds to the realistic defect concentration @xmath39=2.5@xmath40 . to simulate the worse - case scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the impurities have been attached to the opposite layers . in this case , the overlap of the defects tails is weakest as the defect tails for small atomic radius impurity are stronger pronounced in the layer the impurity is attached to . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , instead of straight line location , the impurities have been placed obliquely that also reduces the interaction of their defect tails ( oblique line involves the lead atoms while the defect tails are stronger on the oxygen atoms to be on the straight line shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](c ) ) . for such impurity location , </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction strength are accounted by @xmath38=0.04 ev ( a distance between impurities was 8.66  ) . </S>",
    "<S> in order to roughly estimate the curie temperature @xmath41 , the simplified mean - field approximation for the heisenberg model can be applied as @xmath42 @xcite ( @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curie temperature is found to be just above 300 k for 2.5@xmath40 of impurity but this value is rather underestimated as the worse - case scenario on impurity location has been applied .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to generate the local magnetic moment in compounds of @xmath1-pbo crystal structure by its doping with non - magnetic impurities belonging to group 13th or 14th of the periodic table . in analogy with magnetic ions , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment origin is due to partially filled orbitals , but instead of @xmath4 or @xmath5 types it is being of @xmath3-type . </S>",
    "<S> the partial occupation of @xmath3 orbital appears as a result of the unique bonding of impurities with the host lattice : the original partial occupation of @xmath3 orbital of impurity is preserved after its bonding to the host . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the magnetic behavior of the dopants depends on their atomic radius : dopants with the smaller radius are found to establish the higher on - site stability of the localized spins . for the si and c impurities , the on - site stability reaches such a high magnitude that it becomes comparable with that for the magnetic ions of @xmath4 or @xmath5 types @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another benefit of the small atomic radius of impurity is its near zero defect formation energy that shifts the solubility limit to magnitudes as high as @xmath31@xmath32 @xmath33 . for the spintronics applications , </S>",
    "<S> the chemical elements from group 13 of the periodic table are found to induce @xmath44 ferromagnetism . among all , </S>",
    "<S> in particular the ga impurity shows the characteristics required to establish the magnetic percolation above the room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> overall , it has been shown that the @xmath1-pbo crystal structure is a good candidate to become the semiconductor host for @xmath0 magnetism as it offers a flexibility to tune magnetism by the changing the impurity type . </S>"
