    "phase equilibria of binary liquid mixtures are subject of immense research interest since closed loops of immiscibility were experimentally observed in the nicotine - water mixture @xcite and later on , in several aqueous solutions of the 1- , 2- , 3- and 4-methylpiperidine @xcite , @xmath0- and @xmath1-picoline @xcite , 2,4- and 2,6-dimethylpyridine @xcite , the glycerol - guaiacol mixture @xcite , and also in many polymeric blends @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that an existence of the closed - loop coexistence curves with both upper ( @xmath2 ) as well as lower ( @xmath3 ) critical solution temperatures evidently contradicts with intuitive expectations based on thermodynamical description of demixing , which predicts , on the contrary , a bell - shaped coexistence curve terminating at a single @xmath2 instead of having an island of immiscibility .",
    "early explanation of this remarkable and rather unexpected phenomenon has been suggested by hirschfelder , stevenson and eyring @xcite who associated an appearance of the reentrant miscibility with a presence of highly orientation - dependent forces , such as hydrogen bonding , which becomes rather inefficient above a certain critical temperature .",
    "in addition , if directional bonding occurs between like as well as unlike particles and the sum of interaction energies for pairs of like particles is simultaneously greater than for pairs of unlike particles , the binary mixture may even phase separate at low temperatures to yield an usual bell - shaped coexistence curve with the low - temperature @xmath2 below an additional closed loop .",
    "although one meets with such an intriguing situation rather rarely because freezing transitions usually camouflage the lowest @xmath2 , the aqueous solution of 2-butanol provides a striking example of the binary mixture with the closed loop above the bell - shaped coexistence curve @xcite .",
    "so far , different lattice models of liquid mixtures have been proposed and dealt with in order to bring an insight into a reentrant miscibility phenomenon @xcite .",
    "even though all lattice models provide somewhat oversimplified picture of the liquid mixtures , some of the lattice models have already proved their worth due to their capability to explain the reentrant miscibility of hydrogen - bonded liquid mixtures @xcite .",
    "most of theoretical predictions for a closed - loop formation were indeed based on the lattice - statistical models naturally describing the directional character of highly orientationally dependent forces and moreover , the lattice models can be rather easily treated using relatively precise bethe - guggenheim quasichemical approximation @xcite or migdal - kadanoff approach formulated on the basis of renormalization group theory @xcite . besides , there even exist few exactly solvable lattice models , such as frenkel - louis model @xcite or lin - taylor model ( ltm ) @xcite , which give qualitatively correct results for a phase separation without being affected by any approximation .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that more complete understanding of the reentrant miscibility has been achieved by exploring off - lattice continuum models , which can be treated within the perturbation theory of wertheim @xcite or the gibbs - ensemble monte - carlo simulation technique @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we shall treat one particular example of ltm recently remarkably generalized by romero - enrique and co - workers @xcite . among other matters ,",
    "the generalized ltm has proved its usefulness in elucidating the reentrant miscibility as it has provided a plausible explanation of its microscopic origin . even if the procedure worked out previously by romero - enrique _",
    "et al_. @xcite is rather general and contains our version of the model only as a special case , the numerical results reported on previously were mostly restricted to ltm on a square lattice , which is a rather exceptional case of the self - dual lattice . in this respect",
    ", we shall therefore examine here the phase separation in the binary mixture of large hexagonal particles and small triangular ones , which are allowed to occupy basic unit cells of the hexagonal lattice . as we shall see hereafter",
    ", this model also exhibits the same substantial diversity of phase diagrams as remarked by romero - enrique and co - workers @xcite and all available scenarios for coexistence curves including those with a closed loop of immiscibility will be indeed confirmed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the foundations of the generalized ltm on the hexagonal lattice and basic steps of the exact method are given in the section [ model ] .",
    "section [ result ] deals with the most interesting numerical results obtained for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves .",
    "finally , some conclusions are mentioned in the section [ conclusion ] .",
    "let us begin by recalling foundations of the generalized ltm on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "assuming that the binary mixture consists of two kind of species , the large hexagonal particles a and the small triangular ones b , ltm on the hexagonal lattice can be defined through the following rules : ( i ) each hexagonal unit cell consists of six triangular sub - units ; ( ii ) none of a - a and a - b pairs can occupy the same hexagon ; ( iii ) the small particles b can occupy the cells left empty by the large particles a ; ( iv ) each triangular sub - unit can be occupied by at most one particle b ; ( v ) pairwise interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 exist between the nearest - neighbouring a - a and a - b pairs sharing a common edge ( fig .",
    "next , we shall refer to @xmath6 and @xmath7 as to the chemical potentials relative to the particles a and b , respectively . for further convenience , let us also define fugacities of both the particles by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 absolute temperature . the grand - canonical partition function of this binary liquid mixture can be written in the form of a sum taken over all occupation configurations @xmath12 available for a given system @xmath13 above , @xmath14 labels occupation number of the basic unit cell ( hexagon ) , whereas @xmath15 if @xmath16th hexagon is occupied by the large particle a , otherwise @xmath17 .",
    "the summation @xmath18 runs over all basic unit cells of the hexagonal lattice and the other one @xmath19 is performed over all pairs of nearest - neighbour unit cells . if the configuration of large hexagonal particles a is fixed , the grand - canonical partition function @xmath20 of the small particles b can be expressed as follows @xmath21 here , @xmath22",
    "( @xmath23 ) denotes the total number of triangular sub - units available for occupancy to the small particles b , which have ( not ) a common edge with the large particles a. when taking into account the lattice geometry , both the numbers can easily be evaluated in terms of the occupation numbers @xmath24 where @xmath25 labels the total number of the lattice cells ( hexagons ) . at this stage",
    ", the grand - canonical partition function of the binary mixture can be mapped onto an one - component lattice - gas model for the species a by substituting ( [ gcpfb ] ) , ( [ numb1 ] ) and ( [ numb2 ] ) into the relation ( [ gcpf ] ) and thus , performing a summation over the occupation variables relative to the species b @xmath26 \\sum_{(i , j ) } n_i n_j \\bigr \\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{x } \\ ; \\exp \\bigl \\{[\\beta \\mu_{\\rm a } + 6 \\ln(1 + z_{\\rm b } { \\rm e}^{-\\beta \\varepsilon_{\\rm ab } } )   - 12 \\ln(1 + z_{\\rm b } ) ] \\sum_{i } n_i \\bigr \\}.   \\label{lg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equality ( [ lg ] ) proves that the grand - canonical partition function can be calculated from the equivalent lattice gas model with the renormalized pair interaction and shifted chemical potential .",
    "next , the transformation between the occupation number ( @xmath27 ) and ising spin variable ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 establishes a mapping relationship between the model under investigation and the spin-@xmath30 ising model on the dual triangular lattice . as a consequence of this",
    ", the grand - canonical partition function can be expressed through the partition function of the ising model on the triangular lattice @xmath31^{\\frac{n}{4 } } z_{\\rm triang } ( r , h ) .",
    "\\label{map}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the mapping parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for the effective coupling constant and effective magnetic field in the associated spin-@xmath30 ising model on the triangular lattice @xmath34 it is worthwhile to remark that only the requirement of zero effective field ( @xmath35 ) in the equivalent ising model ensures a possible existence of the phase separation in the considered ltm . as a result ,",
    "the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition allocating the coexistence region between two phases of different composition relates two fugacities of the large and small particles through @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the mapping relation ( [ map ] ) represents a central result of our calculation as it formally completes an exact solution for the grand - canonical partition function @xmath37 with regard to the known exact result of the partition function of the triangular ising model @xcite .",
    "besides , this relationship can readily be utilized for calculating the number density of the large ( @xmath38 ) and small ( @xmath39 ) particles by relating them to the magnetization per site ( @xmath40 ) and the internal energy per site ( @xmath41 ) of the corresponding ising model on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "after straightforward calculation one actually finds @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined as follows @xmath45 the composition of the binary mixture is subsequently unambiguously determined by the molar fraction of the large particles a defined by means of @xmath46 finally , the pressure of the binary mixture can be calculated from the grand potential @xmath47 by the use of @xmath48 where @xmath49 labels the area of basic unit cell ( hexagon ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall use throughout the rest of this paper the renormalized quantity @xmath50 as a measure of the pressure .      in order to describe the phase separation into two phases of different composition ,",
    "let us firstly express the fugacity and pressure as a function of temperature , the interaction parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the effective coupling @xmath32 . according to the equation ( [ par1 ] ) , the fugacity of small particles @xmath51 can be calculated from @xmath52 furthermore , substituting ( [ fugab ] ) and ( [ map ] ) into the equation ( [ press ] ) gives the following expression for pressure @xmath53 + \\frac{1}{n } \\ln z_{\\rm triang } \\bigr \\}. \\label{pressure }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] experimental conditions under which coexistence curves are usually observed meet the requirement of constant pressure . in this respect ,",
    "the equation ( [ pressure ] ) can serve for determining the effective coupling parameter @xmath32 by selecting @xmath11 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 at fixed value of pressure .",
    "a subsequent substitution of the effective coupling @xmath32 into the equation ( [ fugab ] ) then enables a simple calculation of the fugacities ( the fugacity of large particles is connected to the one of small particles due to an unconditional validity of the zero - field condition ) .",
    "with all this in mind , the composition of binary liquid mixture can be consequently calculated using the set of equations ( [ dens])-([mol ] ) .      according to the mapping relation ( [ map ] ) , the binary mixture becomes critical if , and only if , the effective coupling parameter of the associated ising model approaches its critical value .",
    "owing to this fact , the critical points can be found from this simple equation @xmath54 \\bigr \\ } ,   \\label{crit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 label the critical pressure and critical temperature .",
    "the molar fraction of large particles at a critical point can be consecutively simplified to @xmath58",
    "in this part , we shall briefly discuss the most interesting results obtained for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves of the generalized ltm on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the displayed coexistence curves are obtained by cutting concentration - temperature slices at fixed pressure , i.e. a situation which fully corresponds experimental conditions by performing studies of the phase separation .",
    "it directly follows from the equation ( [ fugab ] ) that the phase separation into a - rich and b - rich phases might in principle appear either if @xmath59 , @xmath60 , or @xmath61 ( arbitrary @xmath5 ) . in what follows , we shall treat those special cases in several sub - sections .",
    "if the pair interaction between the particles a is repulsive , the coexistence then possibly occurs just as the interaction between the a - b pairs is likewise repulsive and simultaneously , the repulsion energy @xmath5 is stronger than a half of the repulsion energy @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath62 . the phase diagram for this particular case is depicted in fig .",
    "2a in the form of @xmath63 dependence .",
    "the region inherent to the coexistence of the a - rich and b - rich phases can be located above the displayed curves , while below them both the components become perfectly miscible .",
    "it is quite obvious from fig . 2a",
    "that the phase separation occurs only above a certain boundary pressure @xmath64 , which is needed for overcoming the repulsive force between the pairs of particles a. on the other hand , the mixture becomes perfectly miscible independently of the ratio @xmath65 below this pressure value .",
    "it can be also readily understood from fig .",
    "2a that the stronger the repulsion energy between the a - b pairs , which means , the stronger the ratio @xmath65 , the higher the critical temperature at which the phase coexistence disappears at a given pressure .",
    "next , the lines depicted in fig . 3a illustrate changes of the critical concentration @xmath66 along the critical lines from fig .",
    "as one can see , the critical concentration achieves @xmath67 regardless of @xmath65 when approaching the lowest pressure @xmath68 at which the phase separation appears . for completeness",
    ", three typical coexistence curves are shown in fig .",
    "4a for @xmath69 fixed and several values of pressure .",
    "as it can be clearly seen , one finds the typical bell - shaped coexistence curves irrespective of the pressure strength .",
    "now , let us examine the case when the pairwise interaction between the particles a is attractive .",
    "in such a case one encounters much more complex phase diagrams and also much richer critical behaviour . for better orientation ,",
    "we have divided our discussion into several parts dealing with some typical cases .      in this case , the repulsive interaction between the a - b pairs favours the phase separation into a - rich and b - rich phases and as a consequence of this , one finds a quite similar phase diagram and coexistence curves as discussed in above ( compare fig . 2b with 2a ) .",
    "the most significant difference consists in an appearance of a special critical end point with coordinates @xmath71 = [ 0.910,0.051]$ ] , which is labelled by a star symbol in figs .",
    "while for pressures greater than @xmath72 the critical temperature monotonically increases as pressure rises , below the pressure @xmath72 there is a coexistence but no criticality .",
    "this observation would suggest that the critical end point terminates at a liquid - vapour coexistence line of the pure a component .",
    "actually , the mixture becomes pure a before it turns critical for any pressure lower than @xmath72 .",
    "this fact can be clearly seen also from fig .",
    "3b , where the critical concentration is plotted against the critical temperature and all lines start from the same critical temperature of the pure a component ( @xmath73 ) . for illustration",
    ", we depict in fig .",
    "4b three typical coexistence curves that obviously exhibit much more pronounced asymmetry than those discussed formerly for the case with the repulsive interaction @xmath4 .",
    "apparently , this asymmetry is the more evident , the lower and the closer is pressure selected to its critical value @xmath72 , since the initially b - rich phase looses at low pressures much more rapidly its b component than the a - rich phase is enriched by the particles b.      contrary to the aforedescribed behaviour , it is easy to understand from fig .",
    "2c that a weak attractive force between the a - b pairs leads to a monotonous decrease of the critical temperature when increasing the pressure strength .",
    "the standard bell - shaped coexistence curves , which are plotted in fig .",
    "4c for one particular ratio @xmath75 and several values of pressure , provide a strong support for this statement .",
    "according to these plots and also dependences drawn in fig .",
    "3c , a suppression of the critical concentration @xmath66 in response to a pressure strengthening is observed due to a change of the character of the interaction energy @xmath5 .",
    "this rather easily understandable behaviour survives unless the ratio between both coupling constants does not reach the value @xmath76 . within the interval @xmath77 ,",
    "however , an outstanding non - monotonous dependence of the critical temperature on pressure can be detected .",
    "assuming for instance that @xmath78 is kept constant , the @xmath63 dependence can be characterized by one local minimum @xmath79   = [ 0.146,1.436]$ ] and one local maximum @xmath80 = [ 0.353,1.643]$ ] . while below @xmath81 or above @xmath82 the usual bell - shaped coexistence curves with single @xmath2 should be expected , the coexistence curves with three consecutive critical points ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 ) and reentrant miscibility should emerge for any pressure from inside the interval bounded by @xmath81 and @xmath82 . fig .",
    "4d illustrates such example of a closed loop above a bell - shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points obtained at pressure @xmath83 , as well as , the usual bell - shaped coexistence curve to emerge when @xmath84 .",
    "if pressure is selected sufficiently close but still below @xmath81 , the hour - glass coexistence curve can be even detected ; temperature induces after initial increase of mutual solubility its decrement until a repeated increase of solubility near @xmath2 re - appears , as it is clearly depicted for the particular case @xmath85 .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the aforementioned behaviour is completely consistent with experimental observations of the pressure effect on the coexistence curves of the aqueous solution of 2-butanol @xcite .",
    "even more involved situation emerges if pressure is selected directly equal to @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "when the upper bound @xmath82 is selected , then @xmath2 and @xmath3 incident to an island of immiscibility coalesce at so - called double critical points which are shown as circles .",
    "on the other hand , the low - temperature @xmath2 of bell - shaped curve merges together with @xmath3 of the closed loop to yield a critical double point ( which is marked as diamond ) by selecting the lower bound @xmath81 for pressure .",
    "notice that the double critical points as well as the critical double point can be characterized by a doubling of the critical exponents as it has been proved previously @xcite .",
    "however , the most peculiar critical point @xmath86",
    "= [ 0.265,1.862]$ ] appears by considering following value for the ratio between both coupling constants @xmath76 . in this case",
    "all three critical temperatures coalesce simultaneously at so - called critical inflection point , which can be characterized by a tripling of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "finally , we shall discuss the coexistence phenomenon for the case when the attractive force between the a - b pairs is stronger than a half of the attractive force between the a - a pairs , which means , @xmath87 . under these circumstances",
    ", the coexistence region can be located below the curves displayed in fig .",
    "it is quite obvious from this figure that there appears a closed loop of immiscibility whenever pressure is selected above @xmath72 but below the value @xmath82 corresponding to the double critical point .",
    "namely , the miscibility gap @xmath88 gradually decreases upon pressure strengthening until it vanishes at the double critical points where @xmath2 and @xmath3 merge together .",
    "this scenario can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "4e , where the closed - loop coexistence curves are plotted for three different pressures and the ratio @xmath89 .",
    "it is quite apparent from this figure that the stronger the pressure , the smaller the miscibility gap ( coexistence region ) .",
    "note furthermore that there even exists another possible scenario to have a coexistence without criticality at @xmath90 when selecting pressure below @xmath91 .",
    "in such a case , the temperature induces a phase separation at @xmath3 , nevertheless , both separated phases become pure a before the mixture turns critical and hence , one observes two pure phases of particles a in coexistence that merely differ in their densities .",
    "this observation can be interpreted as a liquid - vapour phase separation of the pure a component , which takes place because the component b vapourises prior to achieving the critical temperature when pressure is selected below its critical value @xmath72 .",
    "the present article deals with the investigation of phase separation in an asymmetric binary liquid mixture of large hexagonal and small triangular particles described by means of the generalized ltm on the hexagonal lattice . despite its simplicity and a certain oversimplification ,",
    "this model is relevant as it provides deeper understanding of the phase separation phenomenon without making any further approximation to the results obtained .",
    "in addition , this model proves an existence of the closed loops of immiscibility occurring under certain conditions either separately , or above the standard bell - shaped coexistence curves .",
    "the closed - loop coexistence curve bounded by two critical points @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates such a kind of the reentrant miscibility , where @xmath3 determines an upper critical temperature under which two components become repeatedly perfectly miscible . on the other hand , the reentrant miscibility can also be found in the closed loop plus bell - shaped coexistence curve with in total three critical points ; the region of reentrant miscibility then occurs in between @xmath3 of the closed loop and @xmath2 of the bell - shaped coexistence curve .",
    "altogether , six possible scenarios for the phase separation were illustrated with the help of exact results for the phase diagrams and coexistence curves : the standard bell - shaped curve with @xmath2 , the bell - shaped curve without @xmath2 , the bell - shaped curve plus closed loop with two @xmath2 and one @xmath3 , the closed - loop curve with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the hour - glass curve with @xmath2 , and the closed loop with @xmath3 but without @xmath2 .",
    "the main objective of the present work was to provide an eventual confirmation of the aforementioned coexistence scenarios , which were originally envisaged by romero - enrique and co - workers after introducing and exploring the generalized ltm @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the majority of numerical results reported on hitherto were mostly restricted to the particular case of the generalized ltm on the square lattice . from this point of view",
    ", the investigation of ltm on the hexagonal lattice is of a particular importance , because this model even has more obvious relevance to the phase separation of real binary liquid mixtures which might consist of molecules with a hexagonal symmetry ( like benzene , cyclohexane and a large number of their structural and heterocyclic derivatives ) and smaller non - linear molecules of the solvent ( like acetone , isopropanol , ethyleneoxide , ethers , dimethylsulfoxide , etc . ) .",
    "our next effort is to provide a further extension to the model under consideration to account also for multiparticle interactions and to elucidate a role of the size of solvent on the mutual solubility .",
