    "first studied in detail by r. peterson in the mid 1980s @xcite , the relativley rapid rotation of some horizontal branch stars remains an enigmatic feature of this phase of evolution .",
    "rapid rotation was not seen in all horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , but the work by @xcite on m13 suggested that rapid rotation was more common in cooler hb stars .",
    "later observations by @xcite of hb stars in m15 and in m13 @xcite further illuminate that there is a gap in the horizontal branches of m15 and m13 , with two distinct rotation rates on either side . at effective temperatures",
    "less than about 11000  k , hb stars frequently show rapid rotation ( @xmath1 @xmath2 40 km / s ) while no rotation rates above 10 km / s appear in the hotter stars ( @xmath3 11000 k ) .",
    "the work by @xcite agreed with a previous survey of m13 hb stars completed by @xcite .",
    "further work by @xcite amplifies these results . in additon ,",
    "a study of several other galactic globular clusters by @xcite and @xcite found similar results for the rotation of cool and hot hb stars .",
    "rr lyra stars appear to show rotation with velocities below 10 km / s ( eg @xcite ) . while it is possible that the pulsations can drive a modest wind which in turn carries away angular momentum from these pulsating stars , this pause in the trend of rotation velocity with decreasing temperature is a mystery .",
    "age and metallicity are the primary factors in determining a cluster s features and placement in the h ",
    "r diagram , and ( in principle ) the structure of the cluster s hb .",
    "thus , if two clusters have similar metallicities and ages , one would expect them to show similar horizontal branch morphologies .",
    "but that is not the case ; this is the infamous `` second parameter problem '' of globular cluster evolution .",
    "the rotation anomaly may couple to the other questions raised by hb morphology through the second parameter problem @xcite so an understanding of the rotational break could be important in understanding the fundamentals of stellar evolution .",
    "much of the work on horizontal branch stars naturally concentrates on stars in globular clusters .",
    "however , field stars that correspond to the post helium core flash of low  mass stars can perhaps play an important role in understanding the connection between rotation and hb morphology .",
    "for population i stars , identification of post helium ",
    "flash objects is complicated by the paucity of stars in galactic clusters and distance determination for field stars .",
    "however , one class of such stars , the subdwarf b stars , are very hot ( @xmath4 or more ) , and show high gravity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus they are readily identified as blue point sources in multicolor surveys , and spectroscopy reveals their stellar nature .",
    "they are the field analog to the bluest hb stars seen in clusters , and have very thin surface hydrogen layers .",
    "but these stars present their own enigmas - in particular the origin of sdb stars .",
    "their origin as stars which have lost most but not all of their hydrogen envelope following rgb evolution is mysterious , as simple models of rgb evolution can not easily explain their miniscule surface hydrogen layers .",
    "models proposed to explain their origin include interactions with a companion ( eg .",
    "@xcite)and even mass stripping by planetary companions @xcite .",
    "the high incidence of composite - spectrum binaries among the sdb stars is consistent with these kinds of models .",
    "other scenarios involving single  star evolution include variations of mass loss efficiency on the rgb @xcite , and subsequently experience the core helium flash while on the helium  degenerate white dwarf cooling track ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . in some cases ,",
    "the proposed origin scenario makes a clear prediction about the rotational properties of sdb stars .",
    "for example , those that involve binary mergers or common envelope evolution should spin up the sdb product .    while there is no direct spectroscopic evidence because of the signature of chemical diffusion , the field sdb stars appear to be population i objects .",
    "their kinematics suggest that , in general , they derive from a younger population , and therefore we assume in our modeling that their progenitors have masses of 1 @xmath6 or greater .    as far as their rotation , comparison with the results for pop .",
    "ii stars suggests that they all should be slow rotators , with @xmath7 10km / s .",
    "recently @xcite measured rotation velocities of a sample of field hb stars showed that a large majority are slow rotators , but that a sample of field hb stars do rotate faster .",
    "the work by @xcite has shown that at least one star , pg  1605 , is a more rapid rotator  as expected based on an asteroseismic analysis of the pulsations by @xcite .",
    "attempts to understand the rotation observations , and perhaps link the rotation break to gaps in the horizontal branch or general hb morphology , illustrate the creativity of theorists .",
    "the lack of a coherent answer to date is a testament to the difficulty of the problem .",
    "following up on a previous study of differential rotation in rgb stars @xcite , a detailed investigation by @xcite ( hereafter sp2k ) explored possible solutions based on single star evolution with different assumptions about internal angular momentum transport .    as we follow the same general procedure here in our study of sdb stars",
    ", we describe the computations of sp2k in some detail .",
    "sp2k modeled rotation on the red giant branch ( rgb ) and its effect on hb rotation .",
    "starting with models that are rotating as solid bodies at the departure from the main sequence , sp2k followed evolution of the models through the helium flash and onto the hb .",
    "they studied several different limiting cases of angular momentum transport , two of which we follow up on in our study of population i hot hb stars .",
    "both cases conserve specific angular momentum ( angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath8 ) in convectively stable regions . in convective regions ,",
    "convective mixing is assumed to produce either constant angular velocity in the convection zone",
    "( case b ) or constant @xmath8 ( case d ) ; in both cases , the angular momentum contained within the convection zone is preserved .",
    "these designations correspond to those used by sp2k .    for low mass population ii stars , sp2k concluded that observations of the rapidly rotating cool hb stars are best understood with models with rapidly rotating cores that evolve from progenitors that have constant specific angular momentum in convection zones ( i.e. case d ) .",
    "case d evolution produces models that can rotate at the rates seen in the cool hb stars .",
    "the slow rotation in the hotter hb stars requires some choking of angular momentum transport by chemical composition gradients produced by diffusion - such effects are seen in hb stars ( and models ) at temperatures above 11,000k ( sp2k ) .",
    "an alternative to sp2k s analysis is given by @xcite , who investigated interaction with a planetary companion as one suggestion for a `` second parameter . ''",
    "@xcite argued that the progenitors of the rapidly rotating hb stars have been spun up by planets or brown dwarfs , masses approximately 5 times jupiter s mass and at separations of about 2 au .",
    "while they state that these planetary interactions are the main second parameter , they also admit that planets do not completely solve the problem .",
    "the models of @xcite rely on horizontal branch angular momentum loss , not ineffective angular momentum transport as in sp2k to explain the slower rotating blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "a subset of sdb stars are known to be multiperiodic pulsating stars . as nonradial modes",
    "must be present to explain the density of pulsation modes in a single star , we may be able to probe the interiors of these stars through asteroseismology .",
    "such work on the ec  14026 stars ( or sdbv stars ) , has already begun .",
    "the general properties of the sdbv stars are reviewed from an observational perspective by @xcite ; theoretical models of these stars are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "models of rotation in single hb stars indicate that these stars should have rapidly rotating cores .",
    "similarly , sdb stars that originate through binary mergers or common envelope evolution should show pathological rotation .",
    "the pulsating sdbv stars , if they represent `` typical '' sdb stars and , by extension , typical hb stars , should allow asteroseismology to address the state of internal rotation of hb stars .",
    "in fact , one sdbv star , pg  1605 was found to have rapid rotation based on the asteroseismic analysis by @xcite  this was later partially verified by @xcite through measurement of rotational broadening of spectral lines .",
    "armed with this initial success , it is likely that asteroseismology can be a useful tool to explore important questions of the second parameter problem in globular clusters and the origins of sdb stars in the field .",
    "most single - star models of hb stars that include rotation were developed for pop ii stars .",
    "the blue hb stars in globular clusters are quite old , and originate from stars that are less than 1@xmath6 . given the potential of sdbv stars for probing internal rotation , we therefore have computed new models of rgb stars and their hot hb decendents that are suited for seismic analysis appropriate to the sdbv stars .",
    "the more recently formed single field hb stars such as the sdb stars probably originate from higher mass progenitors ( up to the maximum mass that undergoes the core helium flash ) .",
    "this means that the stars that are now sdb stars could have had much higher initial angular momenta @xcite as well .",
    "therefore , we have computed models of rotating rgb and sdb stars following the same strategy as @xcite , but using higher mass population i progenitors . also , we compute a dense grid of models to adequately sample the various structures that might be relevant for the pulsators .",
    "we then look at the asteroseismic consequences of these rotation profiles , and begin to analyze the data on the pulsating sdb stars to see if they do show rapid core rotation .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our stellar evolution code and our procedures for computing through the rgb and hb .",
    "we also discuss the limiting cases of angular momentum transport .",
    "section 3 outlines the results of these calculations in terms of the surface rotation velocities and internal angular velocity profiles of the models . using these profiles",
    ", we then use section 4 to explore the influence of internal rotation on the observable pulsation frequencies in a preliminary asteroseismological analysis of the models . in section 5",
    "we discuss the results of the asteroseismological analysis in terms of the observed properties of the pulsators .",
    "we conclude in section 6 with a discussion of our results , and an outline for more detailed study of the pulsators .",
    "the evolution of our stellar models was computed using isuevo , the iowa state university evolution code .",
    "isuevo is a standard stellar evolution that is optimized for producing models for use in asteroseismology studies .",
    "isuevo computes models ranging from the zams through the rgb and agb .",
    "we also compute models of white dwarfs and planetary nebula central stars and of course the horizontal branch .",
    "features of isuevo as applied to white dwarfs have been described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , with further details in @xcite .",
    "isuevo models have also been used for studies of hb stars @xcite and agb stars @xcite .",
    "the constitutive physics used in this code are described in the above references , but we summarize relevant details here .",
    "opacities are taken from the opal compilation for standard mixtures @xcite .",
    "reaction rates utilize cross sections from @xcite .",
    "we follow the standard mixing length treatment with @xmath9 . during",
    "core helium burning on the hb we handle semiconvection in the core using a method similar to @xcite .",
    "as we are modeling population i stars , we assume a metallicity z=0.02 and an initial mixture that is solar .",
    "model sequences were computed with initial masses of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 1.8 @xmath6 , and evolved from the zams until degenerate ignition of helium in the core ( the helium core flash ) .",
    "the core masses at the helium flash for these models are given in table 1 ( measured to the midpoint of the hydrogen ",
    "burning shell ) along with a sample of others from the literature . for this paper",
    ", we did not compute the changes in the compositional structure caused by diffusion , and did not include mass loss while on the rgb . as dictated by observations ,",
    "in the future we should probably consider models that deviate from this simple history ; for example , in the case of rgb mass loss and late core helium flash such as computed by @xcite , the core mass of hot horizontal branch stars could be significantly smaller than the standard values .",
    "we did not follow the evolution of the model through the helium flash with our code , as the helium core flash may be a hydrodynamic event @xcite .",
    "rather , we follow the conventional technique of computing a zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) model that retains the properties of the rgb core at the flash @xcite . the hydrogen shell profile is fit to an analytic function during the construction of the zahb model . for envelopes thinner than 0.0003@xmath6 , we had to reduce the thickness of the hydrogen to helium transition zone to preserve the surface abundance of hydrogen at the pre - flash value .",
    "for most models of interest for our study of sdb stars , the envelope thickness was too small to support an active hydrogen burning shell on the zahb , and the stellar luminosity is derived entirely by the convective helium  burning core .",
    "the transport of angular momentum within stars that are evolving up the giant branch is dominated by the effects of convection in the deep convective envelope .",
    "starting from some initial state on or just after the main sequence , the distribution of specific angular momentum @xmath8 would stay relatively constant , affected only by slow diffusive processes ( and perhaps magnetic fields if present ) , in the absence of convection @xcite .    in the radiative regions of our models , we assume that @xmath8 is conserved locally , which is roughly equivalent to the shellular rotation described by @xcite .",
    "we note here that the angular velocity profiles in our models represent the extreme case of no diffusion of @xmath8 and that , in real stars , the angular velocity profiles will be similar to or shallower than what we report .",
    "the total angular momentum within radiative zones is also an upper limit , as diffusive transport of @xmath8 usually drains angular momentum from the core into the more slowly spinning envelope .    within convection zones",
    ", we follow the procedure of sp2k and examine two limiting cases of @xmath8 transport . the first case",
    ", corresponding to sp2k s case b , is that convective mixing produces constant angular velocity with radius in convection zones , with the total angular momentum of the convection zone being conserved .",
    "there is some observational evidence for this , for example helioseismic observations of the rotation of the solar convection zone show constant differential rotation with depth ( but not necessarily with latitude ) @xcite .",
    "case b models therefore transport @xmath8 outwards , as the outer layers of a convection zone have larger moments of inertia . for rapidly rotating convective regions ( i.e. those where the rotation velocities are comparable to the speed of convective eddys ) this seems like a reasonable approach .",
    "the second case that we consider is comparable to sp2k , case d : the total angular momentum within the envelope convection zone is conserved , and @xmath8 is constant within . in case d evolution , then , the surface convection zone rotates faster in its inner regions where the radius ( and therefore moment of inertia ) is smaller .",
    "in essence , case d treats @xmath8 as if it is a compositional element , mixing thoroughly throughout the convection zone . sp2k point out that such rotation in giant star envelopes is consistent with the much slower rotation velocities found in the convection zones of these stars .",
    "even with our larger initial angular momenta ( see below ) the velocities of rotational motion are much smaller than typical convective velocities of a few km / s .",
    "this suggests that the small amount of differential rotation resulting from the assumption of constant @xmath8 can be maintained by the turbulent mixing generated by convection .    with the treatment of angular momentum described above , and",
    "since we do not include the effects of rotation on the hydrostatic structure on the models , we can treat the rotational evolution of the models as a `` side calculation '' during model evolution .",
    "in addition , we can compute the angular momentum distribution in a dimensionless way , by setting the initial model to constant angular velocity of 1 .",
    "subsequent evolution results in changes in @xmath10 and @xmath8 that are proportional to the initial value , allowing us to scale our results with a simple multiplicative factor that corresponds to the initial angular velocity ( or , equivalently , the initial angular momentum ) .    for comparison with observations",
    ", we will generally assume that the initial rotation on the main sequence was as a solid body .",
    "the initial rotation rates for our models are taken from @xcite  for example , for the 1.8@xmath6 model , @xcite implies @xmath11  km / s , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .      for this preliminary investigation ,",
    "the only angular momentum transport we consider is what is required , ad hoc , to produce the two limiting cases described above .",
    "other mechanisms must act as well - hydrodynamic and thermal instabilities that arise would all serve to transport angular momentum down the angular velocity gradients , effectively reducing the angular velocity contrasts that develop .",
    "these transport mechanisms will act on varying time scales . as long as these time scales are longer than or comparable to the evolutionary time scale on the rgb and hb",
    ", the real angular velocity profiles will resemble the limiting cases above . for reference , the shortest eddington ",
    "sweet circulation time scale within these models is approximately @xmath14 to @xmath15 years .",
    "however , given the steep gradients in @xmath16 that these models exhibit , other shear instabilities could act on much shorter time scales .",
    "it is difficult to provide quantitative estimates of these time scales as they vary within the stellar model , and depend on unknown ( and perhaps unknowable ) properties such as the internal magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , for the purposes of this preliminary investigation , we are content to present and discuss the limiting case scenarios for the angular velocity under the two assumptions outlined above , with full acknowledgement that the real stars will not show such extreme behavior .",
    "generally , our results for rgb rotation profiles are very similar to those of sp2k . in all cases ,",
    "evolution up the rgb means an increase in radius ( and moment of inertia ) meaning that the outer layers slow down . at the same time , the core is contracting and therefor spinning up .",
    "thus evolution up the rgb steepens the angular velocity profile .",
    "figure  [ rgbrot ] shows the evolution of the angular velocity during this phase for the 1.8@xmath6 case b model ( constant @xmath10 in the surface convection zone ) .",
    "since most of the moment of inertia is in the outermost layers , preserving the bulk angular momentum of the outer convection zone at a constant velocity means that the deepening ( and expanding ) star must spin down greatly .",
    "as shown in this figure , the surface layers rotate nearly 4 orders of magnitude more slowly than the core , reflecting the growth of the star by a factor of nearly 100 in radius .",
    "the case d model ( constant @xmath8 through the surface convection zone ) exhibits very similar behavior overall .",
    "however , the inner parts of the envelope have greater @xmath8 than the previous case ( case b ) , and must rotate faster with their smaller moment of inertia .",
    "figure  [ rgbrotjm ] shows the evolution of the angular velocity on the early rgb for the 1.8@xmath6 case d model . in this case , as the convection zone deepens , the material that had a smaller @xmath8 is mixed with the envelope material with higher specific angular momentum , raising the angular velocity at the deepening base . for constant specific angular momentum ,",
    "angular velocity decreases as moment of inertia increases , and the specific moment of inertia increases as radius squared . thus the rotation rate increases with decreasing radius in such a convection zone .",
    "material below the base of the convection zone has slowed by expansion , and an angular velocity kink develops just below the base of the envelope convection zone .",
    "as shown by sp2k , the dominant feature of the internal rotation profile is the change in angular velocity that occurs near @xmath17 from the center of the model .",
    "the rotation profile drops precipitously at this point as the result of draining of angular momentum from the core by the deepening , and then retreating , convective envelope .    during early rgb evolution ,",
    "the convective envelope appears and deepens .",
    "it reaches a maximum depth that is modestly dependent on the total stellar mass .",
    "the maxiumum depth that the surface convection zone reaches on the rgb is given in table 1 . clearly , angular momentum transport in the convective envelope is critical in determining the eventual angular velocity profile of the model .",
    "following the helium core flash , the envelope is ejected , and the remnant core settles onto the horizontal branch .",
    "we have assumed that the specific angular momentum is preserved everywhere in the remnant core , and thus the angular velocity profile will reflect changes in the structure of the core as it converts from a degenerate configuration to a nondegenerate , helium burning region . as a degenerate core on the rgb ,",
    "the structure resembles a polytrope with the same polytropic index as the convective helium burning core on the ehb ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the radius profile ( as a function of mass ) is a power law of the same power but different coefficient . the nondegenerate helium",
    " burning core will have a larger radius , and therefore rotate more slowly ( by the same factor ) in the core than it did just prior to the helium core flash .",
    "figure  [ corergbhb ] shows this for the two cases of angular momentum transport in convection zones .",
    "horizontal branch stars evolved from case b rgb models show much smaller surface rotation velocities than those with case d precursors .",
    "these models preserve a rapidly rotating core with roughly constant angular velocity out to about 0.3@xmath6 .",
    "material outside of that point had been drained of angular momentum by inclusion in the convective envelope early during rgb evolution , and so remain slowly rotating on the hb . with such small exterior rotation velocities ,",
    "these stars contain a much larger contrast between the surface and core rotation velocities .",
    "angular velocity drops by almost a factor of @xmath18 , as shown in figure  [ omvsrhb ] .",
    "the rotation profiles of models descended from case d rgb evolution contain relics of the high specific angular momentum of material in the outer layers of the rgb progenitor .",
    "when the constant j / m envelope reached down to the 0.3@xmath6 zone , and then retreated , the higher specific angular momentum left behind produced a local maximum of angular velocity that persists into ehb evolution .",
    "the inner core never had a chance to share in this high angular momentum pool , and was left rotating more slowly .    on the ehb ,",
    "the core becomes convective , but does not reach the maximum angular velocity material . therefore , the angular velocity profile changes little during ehb evolution - the core does spin down a bit as the angular momentum is mixed , but the inner core continues to spin about a factor of 5 slower than the fastest material .",
    "the angular velocity drops from the maximum by a factor of about 10 or so to the surface .",
    "the general features of the internal rotation profile remain nearly fixed through the stage of core helium burning .",
    "as shown in figure  [ omvsrhb ] , the rotation profile ( with radius ) shows the same general features at the start and end of hb evolution . for case b evolution",
    ", a rapidly rotating core is preserved . for case d evolution , the outer decrease in angular velocity is preserved , while the inner , more slowly rotating core , corresponding to the fully convective helium  burning zone , spins down at the start of ehb evolution as the core grows and mixes in lower angular momentum material .",
    "further evolution results in little additional angular velocity change with radius .",
    "given the uncertainty about the initial conditions ( e.g. initial angular momentum on the main sequence , and main sequence angular momentum evolution ) , this relatively small change in the angular velocity profile on the ehb could allow efficient parameterization for studies of their seismic influence .    given that our plan is to use these models for asteroseismology , the structure of the internal rotation profile is the focus of our study rather than the surface rotation velocities .",
    "still , it is useful to examine the surface rotation rates of these models for general comparison with observation .    given the way we construct hb models , the surface rotation velocity of models of different mass reflect the value of @xmath8 at the surface  which in turn results from the truncation of the envelope of the rgb progenitor .",
    "for case b evolution , @xmath8 decreases with depth in the rgb progenitor .",
    "hb models with thicker envelopes therefore have surface layers with larger @xmath8 , and faster rotation .",
    "however , since we are interested here in the bluest hb stars , the envelope masses are all less than 0.005@xmath6 .",
    "the change in @xmath8 in the seed model over that small range is less than a factor of 2 . in the case",
    "d models , @xmath8 is constant outside of the core - reflecting the assumptions built into the rgb model - so all of our case d models have the same value of @xmath8 in their surface layers .",
    "the surface angular velocity of the hb models depends on the initial value of @xmath8 at the surface ( since @xmath19 ) .",
    "the surface rotation velocity @xmath20 scales as @xmath21 .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the sdb stars can determine @xmath22 to adequate precision to compare with our models .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath8 , the rotation velocity should scale with @xmath23 with the constant of proportionality depending on the models and the initial angular momentum .",
    "the rotation velocities for sample models are shown in figure [ logvlogg ] for a variety of initial rotation velocities .",
    "the pulsating sdb stars - known as the ec  14026 stars or simply sdbv stars , are found in the midst of the ( @xmath24,@xmath0 ) plane locus of the `` ordinary '' sdb stars .",
    "they range in @xmath0 of slightly less than 30,000k to over 35,000k , and have @xmath24 between 6.1 and 5.3 .",
    "most lie at the high - gravity end , clustering near the zaehb , with the cooler and lower gravity members numbering about 10% of the total .",
    "figure  [ hrdsdbv ] shows an h ",
    "r diagram that includes a representative sample of ec  14026 stars and sample evolutionary tracks from our sets of models . given the convergence of the tracks in this plane , it is clear that h  r diagram position alone is insufficient to judge their evolutionary state , with stars that are close to the zaehb intermixed with stars that have depleted helium in their cores .",
    "the lowest gravity ec  14026 stars fall sufficiently far from the zaehb that they can not be core helium  burners for core masses that are consistent with single  star evolution .",
    "thus they are either on their way to the agb or will evolve directly to the white dwarf cooling track in a very short time .",
    "another class of multiperiodic pulsating sdb stars exhibit longer periods ( between 0.3 and 2.5 hours ) .",
    "these stars , colloquially known as the `` betsy stars '' after their discoverer @xcite , lie adjacent to the ec  14026 stars in the h ",
    "r diagram at the cool end .",
    "fontaine et al . ( 2003 ) postulate that these are @xmath25-mode pulsators driven by the same mechanism that drives the pulsations in the ec  14026 stars .",
    "the pulsators that lie in the main clump are shown in figure  [ hrdsdbv ] surrounded by a box that represents the mean values of @xmath0 and @xmath24 ; the size of the box represents the standard deviation of these means . to explore the influence of a rapidly rotating core on the pulsations of sdbv stars , we employ representative models that fall within this box",
    "many of the high  gravity pulsating sdb stars show complex pulsations that require a large number of independent periodicities .",
    "examples include pg  1047 @xcite and pg  0014 @xcite .",
    "the rich pulsation spectra show a mode density that is too high to be explained using only radial pulsations .",
    "nonradially pulsating stars have a large number of available pulsation modes  manifested as a large number of possible oscillation frequencies .",
    "even normal nonradial modes have a limited frequency distribution , meaning that some of the pulsators can not be understood without resorting to either high values of @xmath26 ( a large number of nodal lines on the stellar surface ) or to rapid rotation .    generally , for nonradial pulsations , each mode samples a slightly different part of the stellar interior , and so we can in principle use the observed pulsations to probe the structure of the stellar interior .",
    "of particular relevance to this paper , nonradial modes are sensitive to stellar rotation - rotation can significantly increase the number of distinct oscillation frequencies seen in pulsating stars by lifting the degenercy of modes with the same degree ( @xmath26 ) but different order ( @xmath27 ) as discussed below .    in this section ,",
    "we describe how nonradial pulsations in sdb stars may provide a window into their interiors , and test the hypothesis that horizontal branch stars have rapidly rotating interiors .",
    "the discussion here is intended to be somewhat general so as to illustrate the process by which we can detect rapid rotation of the stellar interior using currently observed sdbv stars .",
    "a future paper will describe our asteroseismic results in more detail and apply the analysis to individual pulsators .",
    "nonradial pulsations in stars are generally expressed in terms of spheroidal modes .",
    "the spectrum of available oscillations are characterised by the eigenfrequency @xmath28 corresponding to a spheroidal mode with quantum numbers @xmath29 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the spherical harmonic @xmath30 with @xmath26 nodal lines , @xmath27 of which pass through the axis of symmetry .",
    "the sign of @xmath27 gives the direction of propogation of the corresponding surface running wave , and therefore there are @xmath31 possible values of @xmath27 for a given @xmath26 .",
    "the radial order of the mode ( corresponding roughly to the number of nodes in the radial direction ) is @xmath29 .    for perfect spherical symmetry ,",
    "the oscillation frequencies are independent of @xmath27 and depend only on @xmath29 and @xmath26 . however , if rotation ( or another non  spherical process ) is present , the value of the oscillation frequency will depend on @xmath27 . in the case of slow rotation as a solid body , the @xmath27 dependence of the oscillation frequency can be written as : @xmath32 where the quantity @xmath33 is a function of the spatial structure of the oscillations within the star ( the eigenfunctions ) . for the above case of slow rotation , @xmath34 \\xi_h^2 ) \\rho r^2 dr}}\\ ] ] where the radial and horizontal perturbations at @xmath35 are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively . for a more complete description of rotational",
    "splitting , see one of the standard texts of stellar pulsation ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond to solid body rotation with a rotation frequency that is small compared to the oscillation frequency .",
    "the constancy of @xmath10 means that it does not appear inside the integral in equation ( 2 ) , allowing simple determination of the effect of rotation in this special case .",
    "clearly , rotation can split an @xmath38 oscillation into a triplet , spaced in frequency by the rotation frequency times @xmath39 .",
    "sequences of such equally spaced triplets have been clearly identified in a number of pulsating white dwarf stars , for example , suggesting that they rotate nearly as solid bodies , at least in those portions of those stars that contribute to the integral ( 2 ) @xcite .    if a star undergoes differential rotation with radius  that is , if @xmath40 , then the simple form for calculating the value of @xmath28 above is not appropriate .",
    "the splitting in this case ( where @xmath10 depends on radius , not on latitude ) is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 \\xi_h^2 - 2 \\xi_r \\xi_h ) \\rho r^2 }                   { \\int_0^r{(\\xi_r^2 + \\ell [ \\ell + 1 ] \\xi_h^2 ) \\rho",
    "r^2 dr}}\\ ] ] is the rotation kernel corresponding to a mode with @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus for a star with internal differential rotation with radius , the observed splitting for a mode with a given @xmath29 and @xmath26 represents an average of @xmath16 weighted by the rotation kernel @xmath43 .",
    "if the kernel function of a mode is nonzero where the star has very rapid rotation , then the resulting splitting can reveal the inner rapid rotation despite slow rotation at the surface layers .",
    "figure  [ casebmkern ] shows sample rotation kernels for an sdb model representative of the pulsating ec 14026 stars .",
    "this particular model is nearing the end of core helium burning as a middle  aged sdbv model .",
    "the modes illustrated span the period range seen in the pulsating sdbv stars .",
    "note that higher @xmath29 modes have more peaks , but that in all modes the kernel has nonzero value close to the stellar core . also indicated in figure  [ casebmkern ] are lines representing @xmath44 for case b angular momentum transport in the rgb outer convection zone . note that even though the amplitude of @xmath45 is small in the inner regions , the large value of @xmath44 in the same region suggests that the value of the rotational splitting will be dominated by the core rotation .    the case for @xmath46 modes",
    "is more striking . for several modes in this model ,",
    "the rotation kernel is quite large in the core .",
    "this likely results from resonant mode trapping by the composition transition zones , in particular the he / c+o zone in the core . at this evolutionary stage",
    ", the model shows some mixed  character modes for @xmath46 which can have significant amplitude in the core @xcite .",
    "tables 2 - 7 present the computed splittings for models of different evolutionary stages that lie within the box of figure [ hrdsdbv ] .",
    "the first two tables give periods and splittings for a near - zahb model ; tables 4 and 5 show the same range of periods in a middle - aged sdb model , and tables 5 and 6 show results for a highly evolved sdb model .",
    "tables show the splittings expected if the model is rotating as a solid body at the surface rate , and for models with differential rotation .",
    "the splittings for differential rotation in models with case b are given in tables 2 , 4 , and 6 ; case d models are in tables 3 , 5 , and 7 .",
    "as an illustration of the kind of effects that differential rotation can produce , consider tables 4 and 5 , which present the computed splittings for two models of middle - aged sdb stars . in",
    "the case b model in table 4 , the surface rotation velocity , if representative of the entire star , would produce a splitting of less than @xmath47 for all modes ( surface rotation velocity of only 6 m / s ) , yet the rapid internal rotation results in splittings ranging from 1 to 80 @xmath48 depending on the value of @xmath29 and @xmath26 for the mode .",
    "table 5 shows what happens for a case d model , which has an artificially scaled - down rotation rate of 10 km / s at the surface ( this model would have been rotating way too quickly if it had the initial angular momentum assigned from the main sequence progenitor ) . for this model",
    ", the expected splitting would be about 15 @xmath48 given the surface rate and the assumption of solid body rotation .",
    "the rapidly rotating core , however , produces splittings ranging from 24 to 52 @xmath48 .    in both limits ,",
    "the rotational splitting is much larger than expected from assuming solid body rotation at the surface rotation velocity .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that the splitting changes ( sometimes dramatically ) from one mode to the next within a sequence of the same @xmath26 but different @xmath29 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the low  order modes in these stars sample portions of the core and envelope , and the exact parts sampled depend on the overtone number . with a steep drop in @xmath10 , the kernel functions ( see figure [ casebmkern ] as an example )",
    "sweep across these fluctuations as @xmath29 increases .",
    "in addition , mode trapping by the composition zones present in these models produces some strong core localization of the kernels for certain modes , and these therefore show larger rotational splitting .",
    "the fact that the expected splittings can be quite large , coupled with the large differences in expected splittings from mode to mode , can make observational identification of rotational splitting quite difficult .",
    "generally , the way this has been done in the past is to look for a sequence of equally  spaced triplets in a fourier transform , and then identify them as @xmath38 for example . even if all members of such triplets are not seen , finding several pairs of modes split by the same amount ( or twice that amount , or half )",
    "would be indicative of rotational splitting . for sdbv stars , though , with significant mode  to  mode differences in splittings expected , a series of rotationally split frequencies would be virtually indistinguishable from modes of different @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "for example , consider the model of an advanced - stage sdb star whose periods are listed in tables 6 and 7 .",
    "the @xmath46 modes have periods that are close to @xmath49 ( radial ) modes . with splittings of 40 to 200 @xmath50hz for the lowest order modes",
    ", the quintuplets @xmath51 and 3 could spread over very large frequency ranges that would encompass , or nearly reach , @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; and @xmath54 . without appealing to differential rotation , such a rich mode spectrum would require appealing to other mechanisms to explain the periodicities .",
    "we have shown that sdb stars , like horizontal branch stars in general , should retain rapidly rotating cores as a relic of their evolution on the rgb .",
    "such rapid rotation could serve as a reservoir of angular momentum which , when tapped , can produce anomalously fast rotation at the surface on the hb . taken alone ,",
    "our results are consistent with the models of sp2k in that without late angular momentum transport , standard models of single hb stars can not explain observed trends in the distribution of surface rotation velocities with effective temperature . however",
    ", if angular momentum transport can tap the internal reservoir in the absence of composition gradients , the suggestion of sp2k that redder hb stars can spin up in the latter stages of core helium burning remains theoretically viable .",
    "other mechanisms can be at work that would serve to reduce or eliminate the strong differential rotation present in these limiting  case models .",
    "also , other scenarios for the origin of sdb stars ( such as binary mergers ) and of sdb surface rotation velocities ( i.e. spin  up by nearby planets ) make specific predictions about the internal angular velocity profiles . in any case , though , we can test the predictions of a wide variety of stellar models if we can measure the rotation rate of the subsurface layers of hb stars and , in particular , the hot subdwarfs",
    ".    pulsations can probe the interiors of these stars and thereby reveal the rotation velocity profile within .",
    "rapidly rotating cores produce rotational splitting of nonradial modes , and the amount of the splittings is not what would be expected from spectroscopic measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "evidence that we see such effects could be the rotation of pg  1605 as deduced from the pulsations .",
    "the rotatonal splitting identified in that star by @xcite is about 3 times larger than the @xmath1 measured via spectroscopy @xcite . while this could simply be the result of a small inclination angle between the rotation axis of the star and our line of sight",
    ", it could also result from differential rotation and a rapidly rotating core .    clearly , it is important to consider the possibly large rotational splittings that might appear in the pulsation spectra of the ec  14026 stars .",
    "identification of modes with large splittings , or of sequences of modes with varying splitting would point towards strong differential rotation . in either case ,",
    "such a measurement would confirm the existence of a rapidly rotating core within these stars .",
    "failure to find such effects would be convincing evidence that angular momentum transport mechanisms on the rgb or during the hb phase are very efficient at wiping out angular velocity gradients .",
    "should that be the case , then the mystery of the rotation of horizontal branch stars will remain with us .",
