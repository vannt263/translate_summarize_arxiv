    "the summary and conclusion are given .",
    "the present investigation shows a novel role of the orbital degree of freedom on metal - insulator transition in manganites .",
    "let us start with undoped perovskite manganites such as @xmath1 , where each @xmath2 ion has one @xmath0 and three @xmath3 electrons .",
    "the @xmath4 electron occupies one of the orbitals @xmath5 and @xmath6 as shown in fig . 1 , and couples with the localized @xmath3 spins ferromagnetically due to the hund coupling .",
    "the hund coupling and the antifferomagnetic exchange interaction between nearest - neighbor @xmath3 spins are given by @xmath7 where both the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined to be positive , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the operators for a @xmath12 spin with s=3/2 and that of @xmath0 electron with s=1/2 , respectively .",
    "the two @xmath0 orbitals are assumed to be degenerate .",
    "the matrix elements of the electron transfer between @xmath13 orbital at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 orbital at nearest neighbor site @xmath16 , @xmath17 , is estimated by the second - order perturbation with respect to the electron transfer between mn@xmath18 and o@xmath19 orbital ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is parameterized as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a numerical factor and @xmath23 is an overlap integral independent of the orbitals . then",
    ", @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is treated as a parameter . the strong intra- and inter - orbital coulomb interactions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , cause the localization of @xmath0 electrons .",
    "we eliminate the doubly occupied configuration in the @xmath0 states and obtain the leading term of the effective hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath28 with @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the intra - orbital exchange interaction between @xmath0 electrons .",
    "@xmath35 is the pseudo - spin operator for the orbital degree of freedom at site @xmath14 defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the pauli matrix and @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the annihilation operator of an electron with spin @xmath40 in the orbital @xmath13 at site @xmath14 and @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenstates of the operator @xmath35 correspond to the occupied and unoccupied @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "for example , for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , an electron occupies the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals , respectively .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( 3 ) does not include @xmath44 .    in the doped manganites such as @xmath45 , eg electrons have the kinetic energy , @xmath46 a similar model hamiltonian with eq .",
    "( 3 ) has been proposed by khomskii and kugel @xcite and castellani , natoli and ranninger @xcite .",
    "however , effects of @xmath12 spins were not introduced in their model .",
    "roth @xcite , cyrot and lyon - caen @xcite and inagaki @xcite also proposed a model , which coincides with ours if the matrix elements of the electron transfer are assumed as @xmath47 . in this case , the orbital interaction is isotropic in contrast with eq .",
    "the hund coupling @xmath8 is so strong that @xmath0 and @xmath12 spins at the same site are parallel . as seen in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , spins prefer ferromagnetic ordering , whereas orbitals do the alternate ordering which is called the antiferro - type , hereafter .",
    "it is known that in the doped manganites , the carrier motion induces spin ferromagnetism due to the double exchange interaction .",
    "therefore , we may expect a rich phase diagram as a function of the parameters , and as well as carrier concentration .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram at zero temperature as a function of hole concentration and in the mean field approximation @xcite applied to the effective hamiltonian . in the spin and orbital structures ,",
    "four types of the mean field are considered ; the ferro ( f)-type , and three antiferro - types ( layer(a)-type , rod(c)-type and nacl(g)-type ) .",
    "we introduce the rotating frame in the spin and orbital spaces @xcite and describe the states by the rotating angle @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . in the rotating frame , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , are adopted as the mean field order parameters .",
    "the kinetic energy term @xmath52 is rewritten as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a fermion operator describing the hole carrier and @xmath55 is the element of the unitary matrix for the rotation in the spin ( orbital ) frame .",
    "we assume @xmath56 and represent @xmath57 and @xmath58 by the rotating angle . by minimizing the energy ,",
    "the phase diagram at @xmath59 is obtained .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath60 in the manganites which we are interested in is estimated to be @xmath61 from the neel temperature of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , let us consider the case with @xmath63 .",
    "at the hole concentration @xmath64 , the a - type antiferromagnetic spin ordering is realized . with increasing @xmath65 ,",
    "the ferromagnetic spin state appears where the orbitals show the ordering given in fig .",
    "this state is called @xmath66 . with further increasing @xmath65",
    ", we find the phase separation between two ferromagnetic spin states @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the state @xmath67 shows the orbital ordering given in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) which provides the gain of the kinetic energy of hole carriers .",
    "since the state has more holes than @xmath66 , the ferromagnetism in the state @xmath67 is caused by the double exchange interaction .",
    "on the other hand , the state @xmath66 has less holes and the ferromagnetism is due to the superexchange interaction induced by the orbital antiferro - type ordering . in fig .",
    "4 , the total energy is plotted as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "the two minima correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for example , the compound with @xmath68 shows the phase separation , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the sample are @xmath66 with @xmath71 and @xmath67 with @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "recently , the first - order phase transition between two ferromagnetic spin states has been experimentally observed .",
    "the details will be discussed in sec .",
    "4 . fig . 2 also shows the phase separation between a - type and c - type antiferromagnetic states when is large .",
    "such a phase separation may be realized in the materials with small hopping parameter @xmath73 .",
    "the two ferromagnetic states have also been shown by maezono _",
    "et al_.@xcite the results are in accord with ours although the theoretical method is different each other .",
    "et al_.@xcite have proposed the phase separation between two ferromagnetic states due to the jahn - teller coupling without electron correlation .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the orbital ordering plays a crucial role in the magnetic and electronic properties in manganites . however , the direct observation of the orbitals was limited experimentally .",
    "recently , murakami _",
    "et al_. have applied the anomalous x - ray scattering in order to detect the orbital ordering in single layered manganites @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "they focused on a reflection at ( 3/4,3/4,0 ) point and obtained a resonant - like peak near the k - edge of a @xmath2 ion below about 200k .",
    "they further observed the unique polarization dependence which is attributed to the tensor character of the anomalous scattering factor . when all @xmath2 ions are equivalent , the reflection at ( 3/4,3/4,0 ) is forbidden .",
    "therefore , an appearance of the intensity implies that two kinds of orbital are alternately aligned in the @xmath75 plane ( antiferro - type ) .",
    "the experimental results also imply that the dipole transition between mn @xmath76 and mn @xmath77 orbitals causes the scattering .",
    "the experimental method was extended to @xmath45 with @xmath64 @xcite and @xmath78 @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we study theoretically the anomalous x - ray scattering in relation to its role as a detector of the orbital ordering in manganites @xcite .",
    "the structure factor of the x - ray scattering is expressed as a sum of the normal and anomalous part of the atomic scattering factor .",
    "the normal part is given by the fourier transform of the charge density @xmath79 in the @xmath14-th atom , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the initial ( final ) electronic state with energy @xmath82 @xmath83 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the momenta of incident and scattered photons , respectively .",
    "the anomalous part is derived by the interaction between electronic current and photon and is expressed as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the intermediate electronic states with energy @xmath88 and @xmath89 is a dumping constant . the current operator @xmath90 describes the dipole transition between mn @xmath76 and @xmath77 orbitals at site @xmath14 coupled with photon with polarization in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the contribution from the quadrupole transition is neglected because the inversion symmetry is preserved in the system which we are interested in .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the anomalous scattering is dominated by the mn @xmath91 e1 transition . in this case , how does the @xmath18 orbital ordering reflect on the anisotropy of the anomalous scattering factor ? in order to study the problem , we consider the electronic structure in a @xmath92 octahedron , since the local electronic excitation dominates .",
    "then , we find that the electron hybridization do not result in the anisotropy of the scattering factor , since the hybridization between the mn @xmath18 and o @xmath19 orbitals and between the mn @xmath77 and o @xmath19 ones are decoupled .",
    "one of the promising origins of the anisotropy of the scattering factor is the coulomb interaction between mn @xmath18 and @xmath77 electrons .",
    "the electron - electron interaction in the orbital ordered state breaks the cubic symmetry and thus lifts the degeneracy of mn @xmath77 orbitals .",
    "the interaction between mn @xmath18 and @xmath77 electrons is represented as @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 and @xmath98 is its counterpart .",
    "@xmath99 is the slater integral between @xmath18 and @xmath77 electrons .",
    "the explicit formula of @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 , where @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) is the smaller ( larger ) one between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath5 orbital is occupied ( @xmath107 ) , the energy in the @xmath108 orbital is higher than that of the @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) orbital by @xmath111 . as a result",
    ", @xmath112 dominates the anomalous scattering near the edge in comparison with @xmath113 .",
    "the inter atomic coulomb interaction between mn @xmath114 electron and o @xmath115 hole also provides an origin of the anisotropy of the scattering factor through the mn @xmath18-o @xmath19 hybridization .",
    "the interaction is represented by @xmath116 , where the definition of @xmath117 is the same as that in eq .",
    "( 9 ) . @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where @xmath120",
    ", @xmath121 is the mn - o bond length , and @xmath122 is the average radius of mn @xmath77 orbital .",
    "although the above two interactions cooperate to bring about the anisotropy of the scattering factor , it seems likely that the magnitude of @xmath123 is much reduced by the screening effects in comparison with @xmath124 .",
    "being based on the hamiltonian , the imaginary part of the scattering factor is calculated by the configuration interaction method .",
    "the calculated @xmath125 near the k - edge is shown in fig . 5 ( a ) , where the @xmath5 orbital is occupied .",
    "it is noted that the edge of the lowest main peak corresponds to the mn k - edge .",
    "the detailed structure away from the edge may become broad and be smeared out in the experiments by overlapping with other peaks which are not included in the calculation . in the figure ,",
    "the scattering intensity is governed by @xmath126 .",
    "owing to the core hole potential , main and satellite peaks are attributed to the transition from the ground state , which is mainly dominated by the @xmath127 state , to the @xmath128 and @xmath129 excited states , respectively , where the underlines show the states occupied by holes , although the two excited states strongly mix with each other .",
    "therefore , the anisotropy in the main peak is caused by @xmath130 through the mn @xmath18-o @xmath19 hybridization . as a comparison ,",
    "the results in the case where the @xmath6 orbital is occupied are shown in fig . 5 ( b ) .",
    "in the figure , the anisotropy near the edge is entirely opposite to that in fig . 5 ( a ) ;",
    "i.e. , the scattering factor near the edge is governed by @xmath131 , owing to the positive value of @xmath132 .",
    "recently , the first - order phase transition between ferromagnetic metallic and ferromagnetic insulating states has been discovered in @xmath45 with @xmath133 @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the transition in the light of the phase diagram given in sec .",
    "2 . let us first review the experimental data .",
    "the electrical resistivity @xmath134 shows an anomalous temperature dependence below the curie temperature @xmath135 .",
    "it is metallic between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "however , as temperature decreases below @xmath138 , @xmath139 increases rapidly and the crystal structure changes to the less distorted ( pseudo cubic ) @xmath140 phase from the distorted orthorhombic @xmath141 phase @xcite .",
    "a first - order transition occurs by applying a magnetic field between @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "discontinuous jump in both @xmath139 and the magnetization curve are brought about at the critical field @xmath142 .",
    "the striction @xmath143 defined as @xmath144 tends to zero above @xmath142 . with decreasing temperature",
    ", @xmath142 decreases and at @xmath136 it goes to zero .    the temperature dependence of lattice constant and magnetic bragg reflection intensity were observed in the neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "the ferromagnetic order parameter jumps at @xmath136 simultaneously with the @xmath141 to @xmath145 phase transition upon cooling .",
    "superlattice reflections such as @xmath146 were also observed , indicating the lattice modulation due to the charge ordering , which is consistent with the previous results @xcite .",
    "the two ferromagnetic phases have different orbital structure .",
    "the resonance - like peak appears at the @xmath147 reflection in the anomalous x - ray scattering experiments , when the photon energy is tuned at the k - edge ( 6.552 kev ) in a @xmath2 ion as shown in fig .",
    "besides the energy scan , the azimuthal scan around the scattering vector shows the angle dependence of two - fold sinusoidal symmetry , which gives rise to a direct evidence of the antiferro - type orbital ordering as that in the undoped system @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we stress the fact that the intensity appears only below @xmath138(@xmath140 phase ) , as shown in fig . 7 , where the notable lattice distortion does not exist .",
    "therefore , the antiferro - type orbital ordering is not the one associated with the jahn - teller type lattice distortion .",
    "note that the spin - wave dispersion in @xmath148 is nearly isotropic , which is entirely different from the two - dimensional relation in @xmath1 , due to the antiferro - type orbital ordering of @xmath149 , which is shown in fig .",
    "3 ( c ) . therefore",
    ", we anticipate that @xmath148 should have a different orbital state , e.g. the hybridization of @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we consider that the two ferromagnetic states observed in this compound correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the phase diagram in fig . 2 , and the first - order transition occurs between them by applying magnetic field and/or changing temperature .",
    "at high temperatures , the @xmath67 phase is favorable because the entropy promotes the orbital disordering and carrier mobility . at low temperatures , on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath66 phase becomes dominant and occupies the large volume fraction in the system .",
    "the stabilization of @xmath66 phase by an applied magnetic field is also explained as follows : ( 1 ) both ferromagnetic ordering and antiferro - type orbital ordering are confirmed to be cooperatively stabilized ( 2 ) the magnetic moment is enlarged by changing the dominant magnetic coupling from the double exchange interaction to the superexchange interaction .",
    "the first - order phase transition from ferromagnetic metallic to ferromagnetic insulating states is ascribed to the simultaneous transition of orbital order - disorder states .",
    "the phase separation occurs between these two ferromagnetic phases and the insulating phase dominates the system with increasing the magnetic field and/or decreasing temperature .",
    "the present investigations show a novel role of the orbital degree of freedom in the metal - insulator transition as a hidden parameter , unambiguously for the first time .",
    "we have studied the magnetic and electronic structure in perovskite manganites taking into account the degeneracy of @xmath0 orbitals and strong electron correlation in mn ions .",
    "the spin and orbital orderings were examined as functions of carrier concentration in the mean - field approximation applied to the effective hamiltonian , which describes the low energy states .",
    "we obtained the phase separation between ferromagnetic metallic and ferromagnetic insulating states in the lightly doped region .",
    "the two ferromagnetic states have been discovered experimentally in @xmath45 with @xmath133 .",
    "the ferromagnetic metallic state is due to the double exchange interaction , whereas the ferromagnetic insulating state is caused by the superexchange interaction coupled with the orbital degree of freedom .",
    "the orbital degree of freedom was considered to be a hidden parameter until recently , since the direct observation was much limited experimentally .",
    "we have studied theoretically the anomalous x - ray scattering in relation to its role as a probe of the orbital ordering in manganites .",
    "we conclude that the orbital degree of freedom is not a hidden parameter but is examined together with spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons in manganites .      the work described in sect . 4 was done in collaboration with y. endoh , k. hirota , t. fukuda , h. kimura , h. nojiri , and k. kaneko at tohoku university and y. murakami at kek .",
