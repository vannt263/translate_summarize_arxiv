    "random walks are ubiquitous in physics  @xcite and biology  @xcite . within the vast field of their investigation is the difficult and important area of _ confined _ random walks .",
    "we present below analysis and practically usable results for random walkers moving under a confinement potential and interacting when they arrive within the influence of one another .",
    "we develop the theory as an extension of work we have published recently  @xcite where we have provided a general formalism and illustrated it explicitly for a specific 1-dimensional case . the application in mind here , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is to the description of transmission of epidemics such as the hantavirus  @xcite , wherein rodents moving randomly on the terrain pass on infection on encounter .",
    "the reason for providing the 2-dimensional analysis in the present paper is two - fold .",
    "the first is that the rodents involved in the spread of the hantavirus do move on an effectively 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) landscape and , although the detailed calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as ks , have unearthed interesting results in a 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) model , it is important to study whether the generalization to 2-d is straightforward or whether it changes significant features .",
    "there is , however , an additional reason for this study . in the continuum",
    ", the dimensionality of the region in which the reaction event occurs ( in many instances trapping , in our present case the transmission of infection via contact ) may be different from ( smaller than ) that in which the over - all motion of the walker(s ) occurs .",
    "thus , the analysis presented in ks had the over - all motion occurring on the 1-dimensional line but the encounter ( reaction ) occurred at a point , i.e. , a zero - dimensional region .",
    "reaction - diffusion theory in a spatial continuum of dimensions larger than 1 suffers from peculiar blow - ups if the reaction occurs _ at points_. whereas our development in ks was naturally built on point encounters on a line , motion in a plane such as in the terrain over which rodents execute their random walks can result in singular behavior for point encounters",
    ". an explicit resolution of the familiar blow - ups must be therefore implemented for _ realistic _ 2-d and higher - dimensional systems .",
    "the theory in the present paper has been constructed in two parts , one in which a straightforward extension of ks is presented but with both the reaction event and the diffusion occurring in higher - dimensional space , particularly 2-d as appropriate to rodents on the landscape . in the second part",
    ", we will display the blow - up problem for point encounters that fortuitously does not occur for 1-dimensional ( over - all ) motion but does in a plane and also show an explicit resolution of the problem by taking the reaction ( passing of infection from one walker to another ) to occur in an _ extended _ region rather than at a point . in both parts we obtain usable expressions for the description of transmission of infection ,",
    "recover a certain interesting non - monotonicity phenomenon presented in the 1-d analysis of ks and , additionally , find here another phenomenon worthy of note that arises from the introduction of a new distance that characterizes the extent of the reaction region .    as explained in ks ,",
    "an analytic theory of the transmission of infection is a challenging undertaking and is needed at this time because of recent developments in observations .",
    "description of the transmission of infection in an epidemic derives its importance from human relevance as well as the theoretical difficulties of its intellectual challenge .",
    "original contributions @xcite beginning with the study of anderson and may @xcite involved concepts such as mass action , sir , and the basic reproductive rate .",
    "spatial considerations were introduced into the investigations independently by various authors @xcite .",
    "missing from all those studies were confinement features that arise in animal motion from the existence of home ranges . that these confinement considerations can not be ignored became clear from the analysis of field observations @xcite .",
    "typically , the mean square displacement of the rodents extracted from mark - recapture experiments is found to saturate as time progresses rather than always growing linearly as unconfined random walks would predict .",
    "the saturation area represents the home ranges of the animals which , unmistakably , perform their random walks in a tethered manner , tending to return repeatedly to their shelters .",
    "therefore , it became necessary to undertake a fundamental study of the transmission of infection in terms of interacting random walks specially under confinement .",
    "such a theory that takes explicit consideration of confinement has been developed @xcite by the present authors in ks on the basis of pairwise interactions in a dilute system of random walkers ( representing infected and susceptible animals ) moving in @xmath0 dimensions . the model calculation is restricted to the time evolution of a representative pair of animals , one infected and one not , and is thus especially appropriate to a dilute system of random walkers .",
    "the motion of each animal pair is taken to obey a smoluchowski equation in 2@xmath0-dimensional space that combines diffusion with confinement of each animal to its particular home range .",
    "this passage to a space of twice the number of dimensions follows the formalism introduced by one of the present authors for the study of frenkel exciton annihilation in molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "the new feature of the present analysis ( as that of ks ) is the existence of home ranges , i.e. , attractive centers for the walkers .",
    "an additional ( reaction ) term that comes into play when the animals are in close proximity describes the process of infection .",
    "analytic solutions are obtained , confirmed by numerical procedures , and shown @xcite to predict a surprising effect of confinement @xcite .",
    "the effect is that infection spread has a non - monotonic dependence on the diffusion constant and/or the extent of the attachment of the animals to the home ranges .",
    "optimum values of these parameters exist for any given distance between the attractive centers .",
    "any change from those values , involving faster / slower diffusion or shallower / steeper confinement , hinders the transmission of infection .",
    "a physical explanation has been provided in ks .",
    "reduction to the simpler case of no home ranges has been demonstrated in full detail .",
    "effective infection rates have been calculated , and it has been pointed out how one might use them in complex systems consisting of dense populations .",
    "let the dimensionality of the over - all motion as well as that of the transmission of infection be the same and denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the locations of the disease - carrying mouse , which we refer to as infected , and the one without but susceptible to the disease , which we refer to as susceptible , by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where the subscripts denote whether the mouse is infected or susceptible , and the superscripts denote the dimension . the probability density to find the walkers at their respective positions at time @xmath3",

    "this allows us to obtain the infection probability , @xmath18 , the probability that the susceptible mouse is infected at time @xmath3 , precisely as in ks , @xmath19 where the integral is over all space . with this definition , @xmath18 is obtained in the laplace domain as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where tilde denotes laplace transform and @xmath21 is the laplace variable .",

    "@xcite and the extension to higher dimensions is in the present paper . produced in  @xcite is a reaction - diffusion formulation of two mice as smoluchowski random walkers transmitting infection to one another upon encounter at a point .",
    "while the theory poses no problem in 1-dimension , one finds a singularity in the behavior of @xmath27-function at short times in higher dimensions . +",
    "this peculiarity occurs due to a mathematical problem of the vanishing probability to find a point in dimensions higher than one ( in continuum ) . a clear way to remove the singularity , hence to recover the existence of the laplace transform of the @xmath27-function , is to consider an infection region to have a finite extent .",
    "we have presented such an extension here .",
    "it includes a finite infection region .",
    "we demonstrate its use explicitly in 2-dimensions via two types of infection region .",
    "one corresponds to a case when the infection is transmitted when the mice are _ within _ a certain distance of each other , and the other is the case when they are _ at _ a certain distance from one another . respectively ,",
    "the region becomes a disk and a ring of certain radius in the polar coordinate representation of the problem .",
    "it was shown that , as fully expected , the non - monotonic effect of confinement on the infection probability generalizes to higher dimensions .",
    "however we have also discovered new effect .",
    "when the infection distance and inter - home distance are comparable , a resonant phenomenon is observed in the optimal value of the confinement for the infection transmission to occur .",
    "this is shown explicitly for the ring infection region case .",
    "we consider that the infection is transmitted _ at _ a range @xmath66 while the mice move in 1-dimension , and start the analysis in cm - relative coordinates .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath171 , the probability density to find the walkers at cm and relative coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath31 , respectively , at time @xmath3 is @xmath172 the first three terms represent the smoluchowski motion .",
    "the infection transmission is described in the last two terms ; the arguments of the @xmath149-functions indicate that the infection is transmitted to the susceptible mouse from the infected one when they are a distance @xmath66 apart , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath173 . the infection rate is given by @xmath174 .",
