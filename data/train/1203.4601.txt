    "we explore how _ defensive complexity _ strategies can be generalized to domains beyond cryptography  for example , immunology .    to explore the role of defensive complexity in antagonistic coevolution",
    ", we introduce a new evolutionary game , the _ control network game_. this game features two players , the _ controller _ and the _ adversary_. the controller aims to respond appropriately to the state of the environment .",
    "to do this , the controller deploys a control system intermediating between sensors that receive a cue about the state of the world , and effectors that take an action .",
    "this control system is codified as a control logic with the cue as input and the effector responses as outputs .",
    "the controller s payoff is a function of the world state and the actions taken .",
    "the adversary aims to interfere , and can do so by tampering with some of the signals in the control logic .",
    "we study what happens when this game is played in an evolutionary context .",
    "we pay particular attention to the case in which the controller must first deploy a control logic , and the adversary then has multiple periods in which to learn how to manipulate it .",
    "such a state of affairs could come about for many reasons .",
    "one common biological scenario is when learning occurs at the population level by the mechanism of evolution by natural selection and evolutionary rates differ , as is the case in a vertebrate host deploying an immune control system against rapidly evolving pathogen adversaries @xcite .",
    "this scenario provides us a well defined and formally tractable learning system to study , in which an asexual adversary population evolves on a fitness landscape and the relevant phenotype space corresponds the set of possible manipulations to the control system .",
    "questions of which control systems are hard to learn reduce to questions about the rate of evolution given the fitness landscape induced for the adversary by the control system .",
    "we can then use population genetic analysis to characterize rates of evolution for typical classes of fitness functions .",
    "we show that complex control networks can generate sign epistasis in this fitness landscape , thereby carving fitness valleys that must be crossed and reducing the rate at which an antagonist population evolves to subvert the network .",
    "thus control systems afford defensive complexity against natural adversaries if they induce fitness functions for attempted manipulation that take the form of rugged adaptive landscapes with long deep fitness valleys . where sufficient defensive complexity is in place",
    ", antagonistic co - evolution can lead to long periods of structural stasis instead of rapid change driven by an ongoing arms race .",
    "to exploit a signaling system , an adversary must ( 1 ) construct or disrupt signals used in the system , and ( 2 ) do so in a way that increases its own fitness . in host - pathogen interactions ,",
    "step 1 is often simple .",
    "for example , viruses readily perturb the cytokine signaling network used by the host , by altering gene expression or by producing cytokine mimics and antagonists @xcite .",
    "the latter problem  manipulating the signals in advantageous ways  may be much harder .",
    "this is the challenge we focus on here . to do so",
    ", we make the _ universal construction assumption _ : the adversary can construct any signal , but does not know what the signals do . making the universal construction assumption allows us to reformulate the problem of evolving to manipulate the host s control network as a learning problem .",
    "defensive complexity then reduces to non - learnability of the control system by the adversary population .",
    "we consider the two - player game between controller and adversary illustrated in figure 1a . in each instance of the game , a cue contains information about the state of the environment .",
    "the controller aims to transduce this cue into an appropriate response . to do so",
    ", the controller s sensory apparatus detects the cue , and produces internal signals that will trigger the controller s response .",
    "the response is determined by a control logic tuned to accomplish some task @xmath0 .",
    "this control logic is selected from the set @xmath1 of minimal - cost control logics for this task , i.e. , from a set of control logics that all perform optimally on the task @xmath0 .",
    "the adversary aims to alter the controller s response and does so by perturbing the controller s internal signals .",
    "[ fig1 ]     we explore a game in which the control logic operates on two signals @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we model the control logic as a simple branching logic on the signals as described in the methods .",
    "a fitness landscape is induced by the example control network as follows : the adversaries attempt tamper by up- or down - regulating the signals @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "up - regulation or down - regulation of the signals cause changes to the response value @xmath4 . for modeling purposes we only need to describe the control logic and its fitness consequences on the adversary as a function of perturbations to the signals .",
    "we can do so in a way that is equivalent to using a particular family of control logics : in the methods we show the correspondence between control logics from this family and control logics with inputs described in terms of perturbations to the signals .",
    "we outline two simple examples of control logics and the fitness landscapes that they induce .",
    "let the fitness of the adversary be 1 when there is no perturbation to the control logic .",
    "first consider a simple signaling network that has the control logic @xmath5 and induces a fitness landscape for the adversary as given by figure 1b .",
    "this fitness landscape is a slope , with each step toward down - regulating @xmath2 and up - regulating @xmath3 being progressively more beneficial for the adversary .",
    "second , contrast this with a control logic @xmath6 that is more complex in that it requires more logical operations per conditional if instruction .",
    "the control logic @xmath6 generates a multi - peaked fitness landscape as shown in figure 1c . on this landscape",
    ", any perturbation of a single signal away from the starting state will decrease the adversary s fitness .      in the case of the simple control logic @xmath5 ,",
    "an evolving adversary population can readily traverse the monotonic fitness landscape shown in figure 1b .",
    "even when mutation supply is limiting , an adversary population can reach its fitness optimum by fixing two beneficial mutations in succession .",
    "this is a relatively fast process , since drift or mutation - selection balance is not necessary to maintain the single mutation upon which the double mutant can arise",
    ". we can estimate the timescale on which double fixation occurs .",
    "sequential fixation of two beneficial mutations takes approximately @xmath7 generations on average @xcite , where @xmath8 is the population size and @xmath9 is the mutation rate for each mutation .",
    "the complex fitness landscape induced by @xmath6 and shown in figure 1c has five peaks .",
    "one of these ( @xmath10 down , @xmath11 up ) is a global maximum ; the others , including the no - perturbation starting point , are local maxima . between these peaks are fitness valleys that the adversary population must cross .",
    "suppose that the deleterious intermediate in the fitness valley suffers a fitness disadvantage of @xmath12 relative to the no - perturbation state .",
    "following weissman _",
    "@xcite , when the population size of the adversary is less than @xmath13 and the selective disadvantage greater than @xmath14 , the fitness valley will tend to be crossed by a process known as stochastic sequential fixation . in this process",
    ", the deleterious intermediate initially drifts to fixation against selection , and subsequently the beneficial double mutant arises and is fixed by selection . in that regime ,",
    "the expected number of generations to cross the fitness valley is approximately of order @xmath15 .",
    "when population size of the adversary is larger than @xmath16 and selective disadvantage is lower than @xmath17 , the system lies in the so - called deterministic regime . in this case , the population is large enough that a double mutants are created immediately and these go to fixation . in the deterministic regime",
    "the expected number of generations to cross the fitness valley is approximately @xmath18 .    on the simple landscape induced by @xmath5 ,",
    "the time to fixation @xmath19 is of order @xmath20 . on the complex landscape in the stochastic sequential fixation regime ,",
    "the time to fixation @xmath21 is exponential in @xmath8 . clearly as @xmath8 gets large , @xmath22 . in other words , it takes far longer for an adversary population to evolve to manipulate the complex control logic @xmath6 than it does to evolve to manipulate the simple logic @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that if the adversary population were somehow to become large enough so as to enter the deterministic regime , this result could in principle reverse .",
    "for extremely large adversary populations with low cost of ineffective tampering the complex logic can be subverted more quickly than the simple logic , since in the deterministic regime the expected time to fixation @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 .",
    "the complex network in that case admits an exponential speedup in terms of learning time compared to the simple one .",
    "we have analyzed two example networks that differ in their learnability .",
    "the next step is to develop a general theory relating the properties of a control logic to the learnability of that system .",
    "a control logic can be described as a set @xmath25 of functions ",
    "one for each conditional in the branching logic .",
    "each of these functions @xmath26 in @xmath25 takes some input and returns either a 1 ( if the formula specifying the conditional evaluates to true ) or 0 ( otherwise , see methods ) . in the example of section 2 , the control logic would take the signals @xmath2 and @xmath3 as inputs , and determine the appropriate response by evaluating each conditional .",
    "we can quantify circuit complexity as follows .",
    "the circuit complexity of branch @xmath26 of the control logic is simply the minimum number of ternary logic gates ( see methods ) needed to implement @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the circuit complexity of the full logic @xmath25 is the maximum circuit complexity over @xmath26 in @xmath25 .",
    "we consider a control logic to be effectively unlearnable by natural selection if the learning time for this logic is exponential in the number of signals @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the controller can force the learning time to blow up exponentially by adding even a modest number of signals .",
    "the major result of this section is that one can construct an effectively unlearnable control logic with circuit complexity that is linear in the number of signals .",
    "formally ,    there exists a control logic on @xmath27 signals with circuit complexity @xmath28 is learnable in a number of generations exponential in @xmath27 .",
    "we prove this theorem in the appendix ; the basic intuition is as follows .",
    "think of the @xmath27-dimensional @xmath29 hypercube where each dimension represents perturbations ( down , none , up ) to one signal .",
    "we establish a control logic by which all corners of the hypercube are global optima and the center is a local optimum .",
    "all other spaces are fitness valleys . in other words ,",
    "we construct a control logic in which global maxima occur only where each and every signal has been altered from its default value . to reach a global optimum ,",
    "an adversary needs to tamper with @xmath27 different signals .",
    "then we show that from the starting place where signals are left unperturbed , the expected number of generations needed to produce one of these beneficial @xmath27-mutants is exponential in @xmath27 .",
    "this construction is just one simple example .",
    "more complicated fitness landscapes could lead pathogen populations on detours through a sequence of local maxima , delaying convergence to the global maximum .",
    "we were motivated by considering antagonistic coevolution such as that between pathogens and the adaptive immune system of vertebrates .",
    "our framework suggests that the kinds of signaling networks present in the immune system induce a complex fitness landscape with valleys and local maxima for pathogens attempting to deceive the immune system .",
    "our results are consistent with two broad observations pertaining to immunology .",
    "first , mice serve as a surprisingly faithful model system for uncovering principles of immunological signaling and control that are also valid in humans even though these two species diverged 75 million years ago .",
    "this relative stasis is consistent with the predictions of the defensive complexity model ; a sufficiently complex immune circuitry would limit the extent to which rapidly evolving viral and bacterial pathogens provoke coevolutionary arms races than in turn would drive divergence between the immune systems of mice and men .",
    "second , immunologists have found it considerably difficult to decipher the rules behind the functioning of the immune system .",
    "defensive complexity might be expected to give involve to complex rules which are difficult for pathogens to exploit and immunologists to understand .",
    "the next step will be to quantify the extent to which these observations arise from defensive complexity rather than other factors .",
    "we implement the control logics for our example networks using kleene s three - valued logic ; for truth tables in kleene s logic , see ref . @xcite .",
    "we denote the perturbations to signal @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "each perturbation can take on values @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "when instantiating the control logic , we interpret @xmath32 as @xmath35 , @xmath33 as @xmath36 , and @xmath34 as an input being absent or unknown .",
    "for example , in the @xmath37 operation , when given @xmath34 as input , the output is also @xmath34",
    ". the and operator will evaluate to true only if both its inputs are true .",
    "the or operator will evaluate to true only if at least one of its inputs is true . after the branching program terminates  which happens when a particular conditional evaluates to true ",
    "then the rest of the conditionals can not be triggered , and so the order of specification for the conditionals matters a great deal .",
    "we use the notation @xmath38 for the and logic gate , we use @xmath39 for the or logic gate , @xmath40 for xor , and we use @xmath37 for not .",
    "we can implement the control logic @xmath5 as follows :    1 .   if @xmath41 , @xmath42 2 .   if @xmath43 , @xmath44 3 .   if @xmath45 , @xmath46 4 .   if @xmath47 , @xmath48 5 .",
