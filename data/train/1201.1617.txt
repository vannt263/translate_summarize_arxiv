    "the present understanding of galaxy formation in a cosmological context is based upon the collapse via gravitational instability of tiny dark matter ( dm ) perturbations dominating the matter contribution @xmath4 to the energy density of the universe , with baryons contributing only a fraction @xmath5 .",
    "in such a context , the number density and the properties of galaxies with different mass ultimately arise from the power spectrum of dm perturbations at the epoch of recombination . for example , in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) the low thermal speed of dm particles makes the density perturbations gravitationally unstable down to mass scales negligible for galaxy formation , and structure formation proceeds bottom - up with the progressive collapse of larger and larger regions ; massive galaxies , groups and clusters form by subsequent aggregations .",
    "when coupled with the evidences for a positive vacuum energy @xmath6 dominating the energy - density of the universe ( with @xmath7 see spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , such a @xmath6cdm scenario appears to be consistent with a wide range of observables ; from the temperature anisotropies in the microwave background radiation ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) to the clustering of galaxies on large scales ( cole et al .",
    ".    however , such observables directly probe scales from@xmath8 gpc down to @xmath9 mpc . at galactic and sub - galactic scales @xmath10 mpc , the computations based on n - body simulations pose several problems to the @xmath6cdm scenario .",
    "for example , the cdm haloes are predicted to have inner density profiles much steeper than those inferred from the rotation curves of real galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1999 , abadi et al .",
    "2003 , reed et al . 2005",
    "; madau , diemand , kuhlen 2008 ; for observations see , e.g. , gentile et al .",
    "2007 , mcgaugh et al . 2007 ) , the discrepancy being larger for dwarf galaxies ( see governato et al . 2007 ; abadi et al . 2003",
    "; de blok et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , cdm haloes are predicted to contain a wealth of substructure , which we expect to observe as satellite galaxies within the haloes of galaxies and groups , in contrast with observations ( see klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al . 1999 ; see also mateo et al .",
    "1998 ) .    since at such small scales the model predictions depend on the complex physics involved in the process of galaxy formation ,",
    "part of the solutions to the above problems may be of astrophysical nature .",
    "feedback processes such as heating or winds caused by supernovae explosions and heating due to the uv background may be effective in suppressing star formation in the low - mass haloes of satellite galaxies ( bullock et al .",
    "2000 ; benson et al . 2002",
    "; somerville et al . 2002 ; kravtsov , gnedin & klypin 2004 ; governato et al . 2007 ; mashchenko , wadsley & couchman 2008 ) , and in flattening the the inner density profiles in both spirals and dwarfs ( see governato et al . 2007 ; 2010 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the above problems may also lie , at least partially , in the shape of the cdm power spectrum , which could over predict the amplitude of small - scale ( @xmath11 mpc ) perturbations . indeed , a strong indication that this may be the case comes from the statistical properties of galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , usually investigated in the framework of @xmath6cdm through semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( sams , see kauffman , white & guiderdoni 1993 , cole et al .",

    "2006 ; croton et al .",
    "2006 ; bower et al . 2006",
    "; marulli et al . 2008 ) , which connect the physical processes involving gas and star formation to the merging histories ( and hence to the power spectrum ) of dm haloes .",
    "all such models ( including different astrophysical feedback process ) concur in predicting an excess of small - mass galaxies compared to observations .",
    "in particular : i ) the predicted galaxy luminosity functions at low redshift are much steeper than observed unless a strong feedback is assumed ( see , e.g. , somerville , primack 1999 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; menci et al .",
    "2002 ) , while at high redshifts the larger escape velocities of galaxies ( due to their larger densities ) make the feedback inefficient in suppressing star formation in low - mass objects .",
    "this results into an over - prediction of faint galaxies increasing with redshift when compared , e.g. , with the evolution of the k - band luminosity function for @xmath12 ( see cirasuolo et al .",
    "2010 ) or with the faint lyman - break galaxies ( lo faro et al .",
    "2009 ) at @xmath13 ; the excess of star - forming low - mass galaxies at @xmath13 reflects into an excess of red low - mass galaxies at @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , croton et al . 2006 ; salimbeni et al .",
    "ii ) the number of galaxies with stellar mass @xmath15 m@xmath16 in the universe is systematically over predicted by all theoretical cdm models ( fontana et al . 2006 ; fontanot et al .",
    "2009 ; marchesini et al .",
    "2009 ) in the whole redshift range @xmath17 where the small - mass end of the mass function has been measured ( see also santini et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "thus , the baryonic processes ( and the feedback in particular ) implemented so far in all galaxy formation models do not seem able to provide an explanation for the _ predicted _ excess . while it is still possible that the problem stems from a poor understanding of the laws governing star formation especially at high redshifts @xmath18 ( see , e.g. , krumholz & dekel 2011 ) , it is interesting to note that the over - predictions of low - mass objects in the cdm scenario concerns also the agn population ; recent estimates of the x - ray luminosity functions of agn extending down to log @xmath19(2 -10 kev)@xmath20 ( fiore et al .",
    "2011 ) are in sharp contrast with the large density of faint agn predicted by analytic ( shankar 2009 ) or semi - analytic ( menci et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) models for the co - evolution of galaxies and agns ( se also shankar & mathur 2007 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; lapi et al .",
    "2006 , shen 2009 ; shankar 2010 and references therein ) , even when the observed luminosity functions are corrected for the estimated fraction of obscured objects ( e.g. , la franca et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although , individually , the above problems do not definitely rule out the cdm model due to the complexity of the baryonic physics relating dm haloes with observable properties , the concurring evidences listed above call for a more radical approach , to investigate the possibility that the conflicts are rooted in an excess of power of the cdm spectrum at small scales , and that density perturbations could be dumped below same characteristic scale @xmath21 .",
    "a natural mechanism for such a suppression is the free - streaming of dm particles on scales @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dm thermal speed at the time of matter - radiation equality @xmath24 . for large dm velocities @xmath25 ( corresponding to a neutrino with mass @xmath26 ev )",
    "this leads to the well - known hot dm scenario ( for a review see primack & gross 2000 ) which would yield @xmath27 mpc , well above the most recent observational limits @xmath28 set by the comparison of the lyman-@xmath2 forest spectra at @xmath29 with the n - body simulations ( viel et al . 2005 ; 2008 ) .",
    "however , for dm particles with larger mass @xmath30 the streaming speed could be reduced so as to bring @xmath21 close to @xmath31 mpc ( corresponding to a mass scale @xmath32 ) , consistent with present bounds but still large enough to affect galaxy formation . if constituted by thermal relic particles , such warm dm ( wdm ) would have streaming velocities @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the effective temperature determining the value of the wdm density @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 .",
    "thus , to lower the smoothing scale @xmath37 of a factor @xmath38 compared to the above hot dm case , the wdm particles should have @xmath39 kev if their density has to match the observed dm density parameter @xmath40 .",
    "this type of relic wdm was discussed by peebles ( 1982 ) , bond , szalay & turner ( 1982 ) , and could have a physical counterpart in the gravitino , the supersymmetric partner of the graviton , in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models ( pagels , & primack 1982 ; see steffen 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "another possibility is that wdm particles have never been in thermal equilibrium , as is the case , e.g. , for sterile neutrinos created from oscillations with active neutrinos ( olive & turner 1982 ; dodelson & widrow 1994 ; shi & fuller 1999 ; abazajian , fuller & patel , 2001 ; dolgov & hansen 2002 ) .",
    "a discussion on the wdm candidates can be found in colombi , dodelson , lawrence ( 1996 , and references therein ) . for scenarios based on composite dm",
    "see khlopov et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "previous studies based on n - body simulations have shown that wdm can resolve some of the tension between theoretical predictions and observations ( bode et al .",
    "2001 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "some simulations suggest that the density profiles of wdm haloes are shallower in the inner regions ( colin , valenzuela , avila - reese 2008 ; see also de vega , salucci , sanchez 2010 ) , and that wdm can provide an explanation for the observed kinematics of satellites of massive galaxies ( lovell et al .",
    "simulations focussed on the halo properties and mass distribution in wdm scenario ( see knebe et al .",
    "2002 ; zavala et al .",
    "2009 ; polisensky & ricotti 2011 , smith & markovic 2011 ) have shown that there is a sensible suppression in the number of haloes with @xmath41 .",
    "however , the effects of a wdm spectrum on the properties of galaxies at such mass scales would be best investigated with sams , since not only they allow to probe in detail the effects on the halo statistics for @xmath41 , but also they can investigate the chain of effects that such a suppression has on the baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation : a modification of the power spectrum changes the number and the formation epoch ( and hence the internal densities ) of the of high - redshift progenitors of local galaxies , an effect which propagates to gas cooling , to the disk sizes , and to star formation ; this also affects both dynamical friction and binary merging , the processes determining the fate of sub - haloes associated to satellite galaxies ( see , e.g. , somerville & primack 1999 ; menci 2002 ) , and consequently the stellar mass growth of large galaxies due to accretion of smaller objects ; finally , starbursts and agn accretion and feedback ( included in almost all state - of - the - art sams ) induced by galaxy interactions are affected by the change in the number and in the properties of sub - haloes .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate for the first time the effects of a wdm power spectrum on the statistical properties of galaxy using a sam of galaxy formation .",
    "we adopt a wdm power spectrum with a power suppression ( compared to the cdm spectrum ) below a cut - off scale @xmath42 mpc , to retain consistency with present bounds provided by the microwave background wmap data and by the comparison of hydrodynamical n - body simulations with observed lyman-@xmath2 forest ( see viel et al . 2005 ) . in terms of the properties of the wdm particles ,",
    "such a cut off scale @xmath42 mpc is achieved for a mass of dm particles @xmath39 kev ( see sect .",
    "2 ) whose free streaming length is @xmath43 mpc , corresponding to the wavelength of the mode for which the linear perturbation amplitude is suppressed by a factor of 2 .",
    "we run our fiducial semi - analytic model ( menci et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) with such a wdm power spectrum to derive galaxy luminosity functions ( in b , uv , and k bands ) and the stellar mass distributions over a wide range of cosmic epochs , to compare with recent observations ( sect .",

    "our results are discussed in sect .",
    "4 , while sect . 5",
    "is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the sam we use connects the physical processes involving baryons ( physics of gas , star formation , feedback , growth of supermassive black holes ) to the merging histories of dm haloes , ultimately determined by the dm initial power spectrum . in the present paper",
    "we use the same model developed by menci et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 , 2008 ) with the same choice of free parameters ; the only change is that merging trees are computed in a wdm cosmology .",
    "this allows to single out the effects of changing the dm spectrum with the same baryon physics .",
    "note that in the present paper the tree resolution as been increased with respect to menci et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to resolve dm masses down to @xmath44 m@xmath16 for both the wdm and the cdm case , to better investigate the effect of changing the spectrum on the low - mass end of the mass distribution .",
    "here we briefly recall the basic features of the model ( for a complete description see menci et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2008 ) , and we describe the power spectrum we use to compute the merging trees in the wdm cosmology .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution is driven by the collapse and growth of dm haloes , which originate from the gravitational instability of overdense regions in the primordial density field .",
    "this is taken to be a random , gaussian density field within the  concordance cosmology \" ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , for which we adopt round parameters @xmath45 , total matter density parameter @xmath46 ( with baryons contribution corresponding to @xmath47 and hubble constant ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) @xmath48 .",
    "the normalization of the spectrum is taken to be @xmath49 in terms of the variance of the field smoothed over regions of 8 @xmath50 mpc . adopting the exact best fit wmap7 values for the above parameters does not change our results appreciably .    as cosmic time increases , larger and larger regions of the density field collapse , and eventually lead to the formation of groups and clusters of galaxies ;",
    "previously formed , galactic size condensations are enclosed .",
    "the corresponding merging rates of the dm haloes are provided by the extended press & schechter formalism ( eps , see bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) ; this depends on the variance of the power spectrum on a mass scale @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the linear power spectrum of dm perturbations at a wavelengths @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the total mass in a sphere of radius @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the top - hat window function ( see peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the clumps included into larger dm haloes may survive as satellites , or merge to form larger galaxies due to binary aggregations , or coalesce into the central dominant galaxy due to dynamical friction ( see menci et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) ; in addition satellite halos are partially disrupted as the density in their outer parts becomes lower than the density of the host halo within the pericentre of its orbit ( see menci et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "since the above galaxy coalescence processes take place over time scales that grow longer over cosmic time , the number of satellite galaxies increases as the dm host haloes grow from groups to clusters .",
    "all the above processes are implemented in our model through a monte carlo realization of merging trees ( generated with eps probabilities depending on the spectrum through eq",

    ".    we do not expect our results to be appreciably affected by uncertainties in the description of the above processes .",
    "although some variance exists between the galaxy merging times predicted by n - body simulations and the different sams ( see de lucia et al .",
    "2010 for a discussion ) , there is an overall agreement in terms of the mass build up .",
    "indeed , henriques et al .",
    "( 2011 ) compare the evolution of the k - band luminosity distribution predicted by three different sams , including the one used here and the de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) model .",
    "the latter model , which adopts galaxy merging histories extracted from high - resolution n - body simulations , differs at most by a factor two in the luminosity of the brightest galaxies from the present sam ; since the major fraction of such effect is due to the inclusion of a radio mode agn feedback in the de lucia & blaizot ( 2007 ) model ( contributing to suppress the k - band luminosities by about 1 magnitude , see croton et al .",
    "2006 ) , the difference in the growth of massive galaxies due to uncertainties in the treatment of dynamical processes of sub - haloes is negligible .",
    "similar conclusions have been presented by fontanot et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "while the above dynamical sector of the model is entirely determined by the initial power spectrum , the observable properties of galaxies are determined by the physics of baryons , which is related to the dm merging trees through the canonical approach of sams .",
    "the radiative gas cooling , the ensuing star formation and the supernova events with the associated feedback occurring in the growing dm haloes are computed for each sub - halo hosting the galaxy .",
    "the cooled gas with mass @xmath58 settles into a rotationally supported disk with radius @xmath59 ( typically ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath60 kpc ) , rotation velocity @xmath61 and dynamical time @xmath62 , all related to the dm sub - halo mass . the gas gradually condenses into stars at a rate @xmath63 ; the stellar ensuing feedback returns part of the cooled gas to the hot gas phase at the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "an additional channel for star formation implemented in the model is provided by interaction - driven starbursts , triggered not only by merging but also by fly - by events between galaxies ; such a star formation mode provides an important contribution to the early formation of stars in massive galaxies , as described in detail in menci et al .",

    "the model also describes the growth of black holes ( bhs ) inside each dm halo from primordial seeds with mass @xmath64 through merging between galaxies and accretion of a fraction of the cold galactic gas @xmath58 .",
    "the accretion is triggered by galaxy encounters , and the fraction of cold gas funnelled to the central bh is derived from the model by cavaliere & vittorini ( 2000 ) .",
    "the active accretion phase of bhs corresponds to the agn , which release part of their radiation energy in the surrounding interstellar medium , thus heating and expelling part of the galactic gas ( lapi , cavaliere , menci 2005 ) ; the implementation of such a form of agn feedback in the semi - analytic model is described in detail in menci et al .",

    "the corresponding power spectrum , which constitutes the basic input for the merging trees at the basis of our semi - analytic model , is shown in fig . 1 . and compared with the standard cdm case .    the power spectrum determines the merging histories and the mass distribution of dm haloes as follows ; starting from a grid of parent dm halo masses at redshift @xmath75 ( whose abundance is determined from the standard press & schechter 1974 mass function ) , we fragment them into progenitor masses at earlier cosmic times through a monte carlo simulation , with fragmentation probabilities given by the eps theory ( again dependent on the power spectrum through the variance in eq .",

    "the eps probabilities lead to merging trees where - at each time level - the average number of generated dm haloes of given mass reproduces the press & schechter mass distribution at the corresponding cosmic time .",

    "2 , left panel ) ; at bright magnitudes , the luminosity function shows a steeper cut off compared with the cdm case .",

    "+ in both the upper and the lower left panels , the arrows show the range of magnitudes and stellar masses corresponding to the free streaming mass ; the dispersion characterizing the above relations are related to the stochastic nature of the merging trees .    thus , also in this case both effects ( flattening of the faint end slope and sharpening of the cutoff at the bright end ) are effective at low redshift , providing a substantial improvement of the fit to the observations . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the flattening at the faint end remains an approximatively constant feature , being related to the smaller number of low mass dm halo collapsed in wdm cosmology ; although models still slightly overestimates the number of small - mass galaxies ( with @xmath98 ) at @xmath99 , the agreement is appreciably improved by the adoption of a wdm spectrum , a result difficult to achieve adopting different feedback or star formation recipes within the cdm framework ( see the comparison with other sam in cdm cosmology in fontanot et al . 2009 ; santini et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "interestingly , the effect of adopting a wdm spectrum on the bright end appears at redshift @xmath100 ; this indicates that it is indeed related to the later phase of stellar mass growth in massive galaxies , that associated with the accretion of small lumps onto a central dominant galaxy .",
    "in fact , earlier comparison of different sam predictions with observed k - band luminosity functions ( see henriques et al .",
    "2011 ) have shown that the cdm over prediction of massive galaxies is caused by excessive mass growth in this redshift range .    to investigate this point in detail ,",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "5 ( left panel ) the number of satellites ( with mass @xmath101 m@xmath16 ) predicted by our sam in the wdm case ( normalized to that predicted in the cdm case ) as a function of the host dm halo mass ; we also compare our results with n - body simulations with the same lower mass limit for satellites ( bode et al .",
    "note that the distribution of the satellite suppression factor in fig . 5 ( left panel ) is close to that computed from n - body simulations , although the comparison can only be approximate since the distribution of the suppression factor from the n - body has been compute by bode et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for wdm particles with mass @xmath102 kev , while the recent simulations by kamada ( 2011 ) and polisensky & ricotti ( 2011 ) - both with wdm particle mass @xmath103 kev- have been computed only for milky way - size haloes .",
    "a suppression factor @xmath104 for milky way - size has been found also for @xmath105 kev by colin et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see also knebe et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "[ 0.5 ] [ 0.6 ]    thus , our sam seems to provide a reasonable description of the effect of wdm on the the sub - halo population .",
    "the predicted suppression of the satellite number in the wdm case impacts the growth of massive galaxies since : i ) they are hosted in larger and larger haloes for decreasing redshifts , ii ) their merging histories is dominated by the accretion of much smaller , satellite galaxies for @xmath106 ( see baugh 2006 ) , and iii ) their low star formation at low redshift affects their stellar mass growth only mildly .",
    "such an impact , and why it becomes appreciable for @xmath106 , is better shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "5 , where we show the fraction of stellar mass gained by accretion of satellites by galaxies with different stellar mass found at different redshift ; the color code shows such a fraction in the wdm case normalized to that in the cdm case . note that at high redshifts",
    ", when galaxies have small stellar masses , the accretion of satellites in wdm cosmology is similar to that predicted in cdm scenarios , since at high redshifts merging between comparable clumps is more frequent , the number of satellites is however small , and thus the impact of minor merging on the accretion of stellar mass is small .",
    "however , as cosmic time proceeds ( for @xmath106 ) , satellite galaxies progressively accumulate in larger and larger dm haloes , while the merging histories of massive objects are dominated by the infall of small mass clumps ; at this stage , the lower number of satellites predicted in the wdm scenario effectively suppresses the accreted stellar mass with respect to the cdm case .",
    "to better illustrate the epoch when such a suppression is effective , we also show in fig .",
    "5 ( right panel ) the growth history of three typical massive galaxies ( with mass @xmath107 at @xmath75 ) ; note how all such paths cross the transition region ( where the suppression of accretion in the wdm becomes appreciable , see the color scale ) at redshifts @xmath108 .",
    "this explains why for @xmath3 the population of massive galaxies shows a slower increase in the wm d case compared to cdm , as shown by fig .",
    "we turn now to discuss the robustness of our results and conclusions when the uncertainties in the theoretical modelling of the abundance of low - mass dm haloes in wdm are considered . in the previous section , we adopted a straightforward extended press & schechter approach to compute the abundance of haloes for a wdm power spectrum , and to generate the dm merging trees through a monte carlo sam .",
    "however , at present , uncertainties exist in the determination of the abundance of halos with masses smaller than the free streaming mass @xmath109 ( where @xmath21 is given by eq . 2 and @xmath110 is the average wdm density ) .",
    "there is some debate as to whether haloes with such masses can form at all ( bode et al .",
    "2001 , wang & white 2007 ) ; recent results from numerical simulations ( see wang & white 2007 ; zavala et al .",
    "2009 ) show that , when the effects of spurious clumps associated with the limited resolution of simulations are accounted for , a strong suppression in the number of haloes with @xmath111 occurs ( see also schneider et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "thus , it is important to explore the maximal effect that such an uncertainty can have on our results .",
    "to this aim , we assumed a cut off in the halo abundance for @xmath111 . following the approach in smith & markovic ( 2011 )",
    ", we adopted an _ ad hoc _ suppression factor in the form of an error function , so that the mass function @xmath112 in wdm becomes @xmath113 \\big\\}\\,{dn \\over d log m}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath114 controls the logarithmic width of the step ( see left panel of fig .",
    "thus , we run our monte carlo computations and the whole semi - analytic model after suppressing the abundance of dm haloes with masses @xmath111 after the above equation , assuming @xmath115 ( as in smith & markovic 2011 ) or @xmath116 ( corresponding in practice to a complete suppression of the abundance of dm haloes with mass below the free - streaming mass ) .",
    "to implement such a suppression in our monte carlo realizations of merging trees , we first run a monte carlo simulation with probabilities given by the eps theory with the wdm power spectrum ( see sect . 2.1 and . 2.2 ) .",
    "this generates a set of merging trees where - at each time level - the average number of generated dm haloes as a function of mass reproduces the standard press & schechter mass distribution @xmath117 at the corresponding cosmic time ; then , before running the full sam on such merging trees , we suppress the number of low - mass halos in the trees by randomly eliminating haloes of mass @xmath51 with a suppression probability @xmath118 . by construction",
    ", we end up with dm merging trees where the abundance of dm halos follows eq .",
    "note that , when @xmath116 is adopted in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath119 for all haloes with mass @xmath41 , leading in practice to a complete removal of sub-@xmath120 dm haloes from our merging trees .    [ 0.67 ]    the effects on the low - redshift luminosity function and on the stellar mass functions at @xmath121 are shown in the fig .",
    "the overall result is a further flattening of the luminosity / stellar mass functions , caused by the lack of low - mass dm haloes .",
    "however , when passing from the abundance of dm halos to galaxy counting ( in luminosity or stellar mass bins ) , the effect of suppressing the abundance of sub-@xmath120 haloes is smeared out over a range of luminosities / stellar masses due the concurrence of two effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the effect of suppressing the abundance of sub-@xmath120 haloes is not concentrated on lowest - luminosity objects , since - even when sub-@xmath120 haloes are allowed to form at some redshifts - only a fraction of the galaxies formed in them remain as an isolated clump , the remaining fraction being included into a larger galaxy ( with a larger luminosity / stellar mass ) at some lower redshifts",
    ". on the other hand , the stochastic nature of the star formation histories in sams results a ) in a relevant fraction of the faintest galaxies to form in halos with masses @xmath122 ( whose abundance is not suppressed ) , and b ) in a relevant fraction of sub-@xmath120 halos ( when they are allowed to form ) to host galaxies with extremely low stellar mass and star formation rate , so that they contribute only to luminosity and stellar masses well below the observational threshold .",
    "thus , the theoretical uncertainty on the abundance of dm halos with @xmath41 results in the uncertainty regions for the predicted luminosity and stellar mass functions shown in fig . 6 .",
    "a similar degree of uncertainty is obtained for all the luminosity functions shown in sect .",
    "4 , illustrating how our basic conclusions are robust with respect to present uncertainties in the modelling of sub-@xmath120 wdm haloes .",
    "in this paper we investigated the effect of assuming a wdm power spectrum on galaxy formation using a sam , leaving unchanged the baryonic mechanisms already implemented in our previous cdm model ( in particular the stellar and the agn feedback ) ; this allows to single out the effects of changing the dm spectrum with the same baryon physics .",
    "we focussed on the statistical distribution of luminosity and stellar masses , leaving to next paper a full study of the effects of wdm on other properties of the galaxy population ( e.g. , chemical abundances , ages of stellar populations , effects of the environment ) . within the present study",
    ", we find that adopting power spectrum corresponding to wdm particles with mass @xmath123 kev may contribute to solve two major problems of cdm galaxy formation scenarios , namely , the excess of predicted faint ( low mass ) galaxies at low and especially at high redshifts , and the excess of bright ( massive ) galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "in fact , adopting a wdm spectrum on the one hand results in a smaller number of collapsed low - mass haloes ; on the other hand it results into a smaller number of satellite galaxies accumulating in massive haloes at low redshifts , thus suppressing the accretion of small lumps on the central , massive galaxies for @xmath3 .",
    "such conclusions are robust with respect to the uncertainties in the modelling of the wdm halo abundance around the free streaming mass scale , as discussed in sect .",
    "4 .    our results on the luminosity and stellar mass distributions of galaxies concur to indicate that particles with mass @xmath42 kev constitute interesting candidates for dm ; such an indication adds to the existing astrophysical evidences from ( see references in the introduction ) : a ) the observed galaxy structures at small scales ( @xmath124 kpc ) ; b ) the cored profiles of galaxies ; c ) the number of sub haloes and satellites in the haloes of massive galaxies .    directly testing whether dm is constituted by such particles ,",
    "is a realistic possibility for the near future .",
    "a cosmological direct probe of wdm could be provided by cosmic shear ( weak gravitational lensing ) , which has the advantage of being weakly dependent on baryonic physics .",
    "first results in the simple relic scenario indicate that future lensing surveys like euclid could see wdm signals for @xmath125 kev ( smith & markovic 2011 ) , close to the mass adopted here .    if the wdm is constituted by sterile neutrinos , as advocated to account for the non - zero active neutrino mass ( for a review see boyarsky , ruchayskiy & shaposhnikov 2009 ) , astrophysical bounds on its mass can be placed because it would decay in a standard neutrino plus a photon with energy of the order of the kev , thus producing narrow line emission in x - rays .",
    "claims for detection of lines hardly identifiable with known transitions have been published using both chandra and suzaku observations of dwarf galaxies and the galactic centre ( loewenstein & kuseno 2010 , prokhorov & silk 2010 ) .",
    "both the claimed lines are at energies where the effective area is strongly reducing ( 8.7 kev suzaku ) or near the gold m edge feature of the chandra mirror ( 2.51 kev ) . in the case",
    "wdm is constituted by sterile neutrinos direct detection is also possible through triple beta decay experiments like mare and katrin ( see de vega et al .",
    "2011 ) .    as for the case of thermal wdm ,",
    "the favourite candidate is the gravitino .",
    "it emerges as a natural candidates for the lightest supersymmetric ( lsp ) particle in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models ( see dine , nelson , nir , shirman 1996 ) with conserved r parity .",
    "contrary to the gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking case , where the lsp ( typically the neutralino ) has masses exceeding the 10 tev scale , the gravitino mass can range from a fraction of ev up to o(gev ) .",
    "however , if it constitutes the lsp with mass @xmath123 kev , a large value @xmath126 for the degrees of freedom would be needed at the time of its decoupling to comply with the observed matter density @xmath127 ( pagels & primack 1982 ) ; this is larger than @xmath128 expected in minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . of course , scenarios with @xmath129 exceeding the mssm expectations are conceivable , as well as scenarios where entropy - producing processes could dilute the gravitino abundance ( fujiii and yanagida 2002 ) , or where vanishing gauge coupling at high temperature suppresses the gravitino production ( buchmuller , hamaguchi & ratz 2003 ; see also lemoine , moultaka , jedamzik 2006 ) . a gravitino mass @xmath123 kev effective to provide a viable wdm scenario for galaxy formation would correspond to a relatively low energy scale for supersymmetry breaking @xmath130 gev ( here @xmath131 is the reduced plank mass ) .",
    "while its extremely weak coupling with matter ( @xmath132 , see lee & wu , 1999 ) makes gravitino dm inaccessible to direct searches , upcoming data from colliders may allow for signals from light gravitinos with mass in the ev to mev range ( see feng , kamionkowski & lee 2010 ) .",
    "light gravitinos would be produced primarily in the decays of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle , resulting in a variety of signals , including di - photons , delayed and nonpointing photons , kinked charged tracks , and heavy metastable charged particles .",
    "if light gravitino constitutes wdm , the 7 tev lhc with 1  fb@xmath133 could see evidence for hundreds of light - gravitino events .",
    "our results have straightforward implications concerning the growth of supermassive black holes and the evolution of agns . in cosmological galaxy",
    "formation theories , these are tightly related to the evolution of their host galaxies , as indicated also by the observed correlation between the mass of supermassive black holes and global properties of their host galaxies , like the stellar mass or the velocity dispersion ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "as recalled in the introduction ( see references therein ) , the over - predictions of low - mass objects in the cdm scenario concerns also the agn population ; assuming a wdm power spectrum could substantially alleviate the problem , analogously to what we showed to happen for the galaxy population .",
    "note that , contrary to what we derived for low redshift massive galaxies , we do not expect bright agns to be affected by assuming a wdm spectrum .",
    "this is because such objects are thought to be powered by gas accretion triggered by galaxy encounters with partners of comparable mass ( extremely rare at low redshift ) , only mildly affected by the abundance of low mass satellites .",
    "we shall investigate this points in a next paper .",

    "<S> we investigate for the first time the effects of a warm dark matter ( wdm ) power spectrum on the statistical properties of galaxies using a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the wdm spectrum we adopt as a reference case is suppressed - compared to the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) case - below a cut - off scale @xmath0 mpc corresponding ( for thermal relic wdm particles ) to a mass @xmath1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures consistency with present bounds provided by the microwave background wmap data and by the comparison of hydrodynamical n - body simulations with observed lyman-@xmath2 forest . </S>",
    "<S> we run our fiducial semi - analytic model with such a wdm spectrum to derive galaxy luminosity functions ( in b , uv , and k bands ) and the stellar mass distributions over a wide range of cosmic epochs , to compare with recent observations and with the results in the cdm case . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted color distribution of galaxies in the wdm model is also checked against the data . when compared with the standard cdm case , the luminosity and stellar mass distributions we obtain assuming a wdm spectrum </S>",
    "<S> are characterized by : i ) a flattening of the faint end slope and ii ) a sharpening of the cutoff at the bright end for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the former result is directly related to the smaller number of low - mass haloes collapsing in the wdm scenario , while the latter is related to the smaller number of satellite galaxies accumulating in massive haloes at low redshift , thus suppressing the accretion of small lumps on the central , massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results shows how a adopting a wdm power spectrum may contribute to solve two major problems of cdm galaxy formation scenarios , namely , the excess of predicted faint ( low mass ) galaxies at low and - most of all - high redshifts , and the excess of bright ( massive ) galaxies at low redshifts .    </S>",
