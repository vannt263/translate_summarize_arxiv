    "from the time when the quarks were predicted @xcite , their nature has remained rather elusive .",
    "the reason is that direct experimental studies of quarks are very limited .",
    "quarks do not exist in vacuum as free particles . under normal conditions ,",
    "they are always confined inside hadrons .",
    "the underlying theory of strong interactions quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that quarks should become deconfined at very high temperatures and/or very high densities @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to achieve sufficiently high densities and/or temperatures in laboratory .",
    "very high temperatures existed in the early universe during the first few microseconds of its evolution @xcite . nowadays , somewhat similar conditions , although at considerably smaller scales and for much shorter periods of time , are repeatedly recreated in the so - called `` little bangs '' at the heavy ion colliders in cern and at brookhaven .",
    "sufficiently high densities may exist in the present universe inside central regions of compact stars .",
    "recently , this possibility attracted a lot of attention when it was suggested that various color superconducting phases with rather large values of gaps in their quasiparticle energy spectra could appear at densities that exist inside stars @xcite .",
    "if this turns out to be true , this would be of prime importance .",
    "the presence of large gaps in the energy spectra can possibly be inferred from a detailed analysis of the observational data .",
    "this would provide a confirmation of the existence of new ( quark ) states of matter inside compact stars .    in theoretical studies of dense quark",
    "matter , it should be appreciated that matter in the bulk of stars is neutral and @xmath0-equilibrated . under such conditions ,",
    "the chemical potentials of different quarks should satisfy nontrivial relations .",
    "these , in turn , affect the pairing dynamics between quarks which is reflected in a specific choice of the ground state of matter .",
    "for example , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that a mixture of the two - flavor color superconducting ( 2sc ) phase and normal strange quarks is less favorable than the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase after the charge neutrality condition is enforced .",
    "a similar conclusion was also reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming that the constituent medium modified mass of the strange quark is large ( i.e. , larger than the corresponding strange quark chemical potential ) , it was shown recently that neutral two - flavor quark matter in @xmath0-equilibrium can have another rather unusual ground state called the gapless two - flavor color superconductor ( g2sc ) @xcite . while the symmetry in the g2sc ground state is the same as that in the conventional 2sc phase , the spectrum of the fermionic quasiparticles is different .",
    "in particular , two out of four gaped quasiparticles of the conventional 2sc phase become gapless in the g2sc phase .",
    "in addition , the number densities of the pairing quarks in the g2sc phase are not equal at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "for example , the density of red ( green ) up quarks is different from the density of green ( red ) down quarks .",
    "the existence of gapless color superconducting phases was confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and generalized to nonzero temperatures in refs .",
    "in addition , it was also shown that a gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase could appear in neutral strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "at nonzero temperature , the gcfl phase and several other new phases ( e.g. , the so - called dsc and usc phases ) were studied in refs .  @xcite . if the surface tension is sufficiently small , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mixed phase composed of the 2sc phase and the normal quark phase will be more favored @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested that a non - relativistic analogue of gapless superconducting phases could appear in a trapped gas of cold fermionic atoms @xcite .",

    "@xcite , was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    while the basic properties of gapless color superconducting phases have been established in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is probably much more to be learned about these phases in the near future . in this paper , we give a detailed derivation of the gluon and photon screening masses in neutral dense quark matter ( the results were briefly presented in ref .",
    "we consider the general case of two - flavor quark matter , covering both the gapped and the gapless 2sc phases .",
    "the gluon screening properties in the case of the ideal 2sc phase ( i.e. , without a mismatch between the fermi momenta of different quarks ) were considered in detail in refs .",
    "some general features of the gluon screening in the g2sc phase were conjectured in refs .",
    "@xcite without performing the calculation . as we shall see below , the actual results for the debye screening masses are in general agreement with the conjecture in refs .",
    "the meissner ( magnetic ) screening properties , however , are very different @xcite .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "several appendices at the end contain useful formulas and some details of the calculation .",
    "in order to present a self - contained discussion of the screening properties of dense quark matter , we start this paper with a brief introduction into the linear response theory and a discussion of the physical meaning of the polarization tensor in a gauge theory . the advanced reader , therefore , may skip this section and go directly to sec .  [ qp ] .",
    "the response of matter to an external perturbation is the main source of knowledge about properties of matter .",
    "the linear response theory is the simplest framework that is often used to calculate such a response . in application to quark matter , for example , one studies a response of the system to an external source @xmath5 .",
    "the source is coupled to the quantum gauge field .",
    "the corresponding interaction part of the action reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the classical field associated with the external source @xmath5 , and @xmath8 is the inverse free gluon propagator . because of the presence of the external source , the expectation value of the gauge field becomes nonzero . in the linear response theory ,",
    "it is given by the kubo s formula @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the retarded gluon propagator .",
    "in momentum space , this relation takes the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy - momentum four - vector . by making use of this result , it is instructive to derive an expression for the induced current",
    ". it is given by @xmath13 \\langle a^{b,\\nu } ( p ) \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\pi_{\\mu\\nu}^{ab}(p )   \\langle a^{b,\\nu } ( p ) \\rangle , \\label{j - ind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the gluon self - energy ( or the gluon polarization tensor ) . by definition , this is the one - particle irreducible part of the gluon two - point function .",
    "the structure of this function is constrained by the gauge symmetry . to see this we consider the slavnov - taylor identity for the full gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of this identity depends on a specific gauge fixing . in the covariant gauge ,",
    "for example , it reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gauge fixing parameter . in vacuum , where lorentz symmetry is not broken",
    ", this relation implies that the gluon self - energy is transverse , i.e. , @xmath17 . because of this constraint , the tensor structure of @xmath14 in vacuum is fixed unambiguously , @xmath18 where the metric tensor is defined as @xmath19 . at nonzero temperatures and/or densities ,",
    "the lorentz symmetry is broken down to its subgroup of spatial rotations @xmath20 .",
    "then , the tensor structure of the gluon self - energy can have a more general form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a time - like four - vector that specifies the rest frame of the quark system and @xmath23 is the momentum three - vector with the absolute value @xmath24 .",
    "the component functions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "now , the slavnov - taylor identity in the covariant gauge takes the form @xmath31 ( for simplicity , the superscripts `` ab '' were omitted here ) .",
    "it is easy to check that this is less restrictive than the transversality condition , @xmath32 , required in vacuum .",
    "indeed , the transversality is equivalent to the following set of two relations between the component functions :    @xmath33    while these are sufficient conditions to fulfil the slavnov - taylor identity in eq .",
    "( [ st ] ) , they are not the necessary conditions in a non - abelian gauge theory when the lorentz symmetry is broken .",
    "( it should be emphasized , however , that these are the necessary conditions in abelian gauge theories at nonzero temperatures and/or densities @xcite . )    in this paper , we study the polarization tensor @xmath14 in the case of dense quark matter which permits color superconductivity .",
    "in particular , we discuss how the structure of the polarization tensor is affected by the ( gapless ) color superconductivity .",
    "it is usually said that superconductivity is a result of a gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "this common misleading statement may suggest that the polarization tensor @xmath14 does not need to satisfy the slavnov - taylor identity ( [ st1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is not the case because a local ( gauge ) symmetry can never be truly broken @xcite .    in practice , when doing specific calculations in gauge theories , one always breaks the local symmetry by a gauge fixing . as a result , it is only a global symmetry that may remain unbroken after the gauge choice is made .",
    "for example , in the covariant gauge which we discussed above , the global color symmetry of the qcd action is left unbroken .",
    "then , in a color superconducting phase of quark matter , this global symmetry is broken .",
    "in such a description , the goldstone theorem requires the appearance of an appropriate number of the nambu - goldstone bosons ( cf . , collective excitations in ref .",
    "obviously , the appearance of these additional degrees of freedom is an artifact of the gauge fixing . nevertheless , their inclusion in the analysis is important in order to insure that the general requirements of the gauge symmetry , such as the slavnov - taylor identity ( [ st1 ] ) , are fulfilled @xcite .",
    "having said this , one should appreciate that the nambu - goldstone bosons in question are not the physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this conclusion is easy to reach by noticing that there exist a gauge , namely the so - called unitary gauge , in which these bosons can be completely eliminated . in a way ,",
    "their role is similar to the role of the faddeev - popov ghosts @xcite .",
    "while both types of fields are unphysical , they are necessary for a consistent description of a gauge theory .",
    "now let us further discuss the physical meaning of the polarization tensor . from a relation similar to that in eq .",
    "( [ j - ind ] ) , it is clear that , in an abelian theory such as qed , this tensor is directly related to an observable quantity , namely to the induced current .",
    "the corresponding current is a gauge invariant quantity in an abelian theory .",
    "in contrast , the induced current in a non - abelian theory is not a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "then , the physical meaning of the polarization tensor is not so clear . in spite of this difficulty",
    ", we shall use the same interpretation of the polarization tensor in quark matter as in an abelian theory .    in this paper",
    ", we study static large - distance , electric and magnetic , screening properties of quark matter .",
    "these describe the response of the system to a static perturbation from color / electric charges and currents .",
    "the static limit means that @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", the only nontrivial components of the polarization tensor will be @xmath35 and @xmath36 which depend only on @xmath30 .",
    "note that    @xmath37    [ pi - k - h ]    let us denote the values of the two nontrivial component functions in the limit @xmath38 ( large distances ) as follows :    @xmath39    [ m - k - h ]    the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the debye and meissner screening masses , respectively .",
    "it can be shown , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , that the quantity @xmath40 determines the large - distance behavior of the screened potential created by a static color / electric charge , i.e. , @xmath42 . by making use of the analogy with solid state physics systems",
    ", we say that a system is a metal when @xmath40 is nonzero , and it is an insulator when @xmath40 is zero .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 , when nonzero , determines the large - distance fall - off of the ( chromo-)magnetic field inside a color superconductor , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , nonzero @xmath41 is an indication of the meissner effect . in the normal phase , on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath41 is vanishing .",
    "in this paper , we continue the study of dense two - flavor quark matter constrained by the conditions of the charge neutrality and the @xmath0-equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the use of phenomenological nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models has proved to be very convenient in such studies .",
    "the njl model can be thought of as a low energy theory of qcd in which ( massive ) gluons , as independent degrees of freedom , are integrated out .",
    "the gluons could be reintroduced back by gauging the color symmetry in the njl model , providing a semirigorous framework for studying the effect of the cooper pairing on the physical properties of gluons .    in order to study the gluon screening properties in dense quark matter ,",
    "we need to know the quark coupling to the gauge fields .",

    "the results in table  [ dm - masses ] show that the meissner screening masses in the subspace of the 8th gluon and the vacuum photon have a nontrivial mixing . as we saw in sec .",
    "[ gpt88 ] , the mixing disappears after switching to the description in terms of the physical modes , defined in eq .",
    "( [ tilde - a - gamma ] ) .",
    "moreover , the meissner screening mass of the medium photon is vanishing .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of the meissner effect for the unbroken electromagnetism .",
    "the most interesting results of our calculation are the expressions for the meissner screening masses of the five gluons that correspond to the broken generators of the @xmath251 group .",
    "we find that the squared values of these masses are _ negative _",
    "( i.e. , the masses themselves are imaginary ) in some regions of parameters .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath252 for @xmath253 when @xmath254 , and @xmath255 when @xmath200 .",
    "the standard interpretation of such a result is the existence of a chromomagnetic ( plasma type ) instability in the corresponding phases of matter @xcite .",
    "while the instability connected with the @xmath195th gluon appears only in the g2sc phase ( @xmath200 ) , the instability connected with the other 4 gluons also develops in the _ gapped _",
    "2sc phase when @xmath230 .",
    "this suggests that the gapless superconductivity itself is not the reason for the instability .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the critical value of the mismatch , above which the instability starts to develop , is given by @xmath256 .",
    "this happens to coincide with the value of the mismatch at which the 2sc phase becomes metastable when the neutrality condition is not enforced in quark matter ( i.e. , when the value of @xmath245 is treated as a free parameter and the coulomb effects are ignored ) . here ,",
    "on the other hand , we consider neutral quark matter in the same way as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is natural to suggest that the instability , indicated by negative values of the meissner screening masses squared , may result in some type of a gluon condensation . indeed , in terms of the gluon effective potential , the appearance of a negative gluon mass squared",
    "could be viewed as considering a false vacuum that corresponds to a local maximum of the potential at @xmath257 . in this case",
    ", the true vacuum should be given by the global minimum of the gluon potential .",
    "it would be natural then if the minimum corresponds to another ( nonzero ) expectation value of the gluon field , i.e. , @xmath258 for @xmath259 , or for @xmath260 .",
    "note that we do not exclude the possibility that the new stable ground state has a condensate that breaks the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "in fact , this might be the most natural outcome of the gluon condensation if its mechanism is the same , e.g. , as in ref .",
    "the possibility of breaking the rotational symmetry is also suggested by the fact the it is the magnetic components of gluons @xmath261 rather than the electric gluons @xmath262 that drive the instability .",
    "the expectation that the rotational symmetry is broken in the ground state may also hint at the possibility of a state with deformed quark fermi surfaces which was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it may happen that not only the rotational symmetry but also the translational symmetry is broken in the true ground state of neutral two - flavor quark matter .",
    "this would be the case when the diquark condensate is inhomogeneous like , for example , in the crystalline phase @xcite , or like in the abrikosov s vortex lattice phase @xcite .",
    "regarding the crystalline phase ( also known as the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell phase @xcite ) in two - flavor quark matter , it might be appropriate to mention that this phase is claimed to appear precisely when @xmath263 .",
    "it is not clear , however , how a first order transition from the 2sc phase to the crystalline phase at @xmath264 can be triggered by vanishingly small tachyonic masses of gluons .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that the gluon type instability , indicated by negative values of the meissner screening masses squared , has nothing to do ( at least , directly ) with the so - called sarma instability @xcite .",
    "it was shown for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite that the sarma instability in the effective potential for the order parameter is removed when the neutrality condition is imposed , or when the pairing interaction has a specific momentum structure and the ratio of the densities of the pairing fermions is kept fixed @xcite .",
    "one may still argue that , despite the absence of the sarma instability in the effective potential , there exists another type of an instability , discussed in ref .",
    "there it was suggested that paramagnetic currents should be spontaneously induced in the gapless phase .",
    "in fact , we think that the instability connected with the @xmath195th gluon in the g2sc phase could indeed be of this type .",
    "one may find some similarity between the chromomagnetic instability found in this paper and the instabilities that have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in application to a state of matter produced in heavy ion collisions",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the quark distribution functions are completely isotropic in momentum space in the case of dense quark matter studied in this paper which is in contrast to a typical situation in ref .",
    "this fact suggests that the mechanism of the instability seen here is more subtle .    in passing",
    ", we would like to mention that there might exist some analogy between the instability found in this paper and the so - called paramagnetic superconductivity discussed in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "if these phenomena are related indeed , it would be natural to expect that the instability of neutral dense quark matter is resolved through a spontaneous chromo - magnetization .",
    "again , the breakdown of the rotational symmetry in this case would seem inevitable .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the debye and meissner screening masses for the gluons and the photon in the case of neutral , @xmath0-equilibrated two - flavor dense quark matter .",
    "a general form of our result allows to use it in the gapped phase as well as in the gapless color superconducting phase by a simple change of the magnitude of the diquark pairing .",
    "this latter determines the ratio of the gap parameter and the mismatch of the quark fermi momenta , i.e. , @xmath235 .",
    "the qualitative dependence of this ratio on the diquark coupling constant in the case of neutral quark matter was studied in refs .",
    "it was shown that the ground state corresponds to the normal phase at weak coupling , i.e. , @xmath244 . at some intermediate values of the diquark coupling",
    ", the ground state is the g2sc phase .",
    "the ratio @xmath235 is less than 1 in such a gapless phase .",
    "finally , at large coupling , the ground state is the 2sc phase , and the ratio @xmath235 is larger than 1 .",
    "one could also check that this ratio @xmath235 increases monotonically with increasing the coupling .",
    "the results for the debye and the meissner screening masses in this paper give a natural interpolation between the known values in the normal phase @xcite and in the ideal 2sc phase @xcite .",
    "the most important result of our calculation is that the expressions for the meissner screening masses of the five gluons , corresponding to the five broken generators of the @xmath251 group , are _ imaginary_. this is interpreted as an indication of a chromomagnetic instability in the corresponding phases of quark matter .",
    "it remains to be clarified the consequences of such an instability , and the nature of the true ground state in neutral two - flavor quark matter .    in the future",
    ", it would be very interesting to investigate whether a chromomagnetic instability also develops in the gcfl phase @xcite , where the low - energy quasiparticle spectrum resembles the spectrum in the g2sc phase .",
