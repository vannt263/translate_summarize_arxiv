    "solar flares are explosive events in the solar corona , involving the release of energy stored in active - region magnetic fields .",
    "active regions are dynamic , evolving in time due to the emergence and submergence of magnetic flux from the sub - photosphere , stressing by photospheric motions , and the occurrence of flares .",
    "it is of interest to understand the dynamical energy balance of active regions .",
    "flares exhibit a wide range of energies .",
    "the largest flares may involve the release of up to @xmath7 of energy , and are associated with large - scale expulsions of material from the corona ( coronal mass ejections , or cmes ) , involving comparable energies . small flare - like events",
    "are observed down to the limits of observation and are difficult to distinguish from a variety of small - scale solar activity .",
    "the distribution of flare energies follows a power - law distribution @xcite . specifically , the frequency - energy distribution @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of flares observed per unit time and per unit energy ( @xmath9 ) , obeys @xmath10 where the factor @xmath11 is a ( time - dependent ) measure of the total flaring rate , and @xmath12 .",
    "this distribution is often constructed for flares from all active regions present on the sun over some period of time , but it also appears to apply to individual active regions @xcite , which suggests that the power law is fundamental to the flare mechanism . a popular model explaining the power law is the avalanche model @xcite , in which the magnetic field in the corona is assumed to be in a self - organized critical state , and subject to avalanches of small - scale reconnection events .",
    "the distribution  ( [ eq : obs_pl ] ) must have an upper roll - over , to ensure that the total energy released in flares is finite @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms causing flares are not well understood , and flares appear to occur randomly in time , although certain properties of active regions correlate with flaring ( _ e.g. _ ; ; ; ) . correspondingly , the prediction of flares is in its infancy : the methods used are probabilistic and are rather inaccurate at predicting the occurrence of large flares , which are rare but which strongly influence our local space weather @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of flares in time may be investigated via a second observable distribution , the flare waiting - time distribution , or the distribution of times between events ( this distribution is also referred to as the `` interval distribution '' ) .",
    "determinations of flare waiting - time distributions have given varied results , suggesting that the observed distribution may depend on the particular active region , on time , and that it also may be influenced by event definition and selection procedures .",
    "for some active regions , the distribution is consistent with a simple poisson process , _ i.e. _ independent events occurring at a constant mean rate @xcite , and the corresponding waiting - time distribution is exponential .",
    "other active regions exhibit time - variation in the flaring process , and flare occurrence may be approximated by a piecewise - constant , or more generally time - varying poisson process , in which case the distribution is a sum or integral over exponentials @xcite . on longer time scales ,",
    "the distribution exhibits a power - law tail for events from the whole sun @xcite .",
    "some authors have also argued that the process is fundamentally non - poissonian ( _ e.g. _ ) , although the arguments neglect the role of time - dependence .",
    "the energy balance of active regions presents a puzzle , because of the large drops in energy due to large solar flares . in",
    "the following we consider a simple `` black box '' approach to modelling the free energy of an active region ( the energy available to power flares ) , an approach that goes back to .",
    "energy is assumed to be continuously supplied to the active region by some external mechanism .",
    "the energy is stored locally in the corona , and some is released at particular times in flares .",
    "the flaring process is considered to be stochastic , whereas energy supply is deterministic .",
    "flares are treated as point processes in time , _",
    "i.e. _ they occur at one instant in time , and they involve jump transitions ( discontinuous changes ) in energy .",
    "a general model of this kind was presented in and further developed in .",
    "the general model is based on a master equation for the probability distribution [ @xmath13 for the free energy ( @xmath9 ) of an active region at time @xmath14 .",
    "the free parameters in the model are a prescribed energy supply rate to the system [ @xmath15 , and prescribed transition rates [ @xmath16 , describing the rate of jumps from energy @xmath9 to energy @xmath17 .",
    "these two rate functions may have any functional form .",
    "in it was argued that the energy - supply rate should not depend on the energy ( @xmath9 ) of the system , since active regions are driven externally , and hence a constant energy supply rate is appropriate . it was also argued that , to produce an appropriate power - law flare frequency - energy distribution , transition rates of the form @xmath18 are required ( in the steady state ) . and investigated the model by solving the master equation in the steady state , for these `` flare - like '' choices for the free parameters . in",
    "the emphasis was on the basic model and the arguments for the appropriate flare - like choices .",
    "a model was constructed that could reproduce power - law behavior in the flare frequency - energy distribution over an arbitrary number of decades in energy , up to a high energy roll - over set by the decline of @xmath19 at large energy .",
    "hence the flare - like model was confirmed to reproduce this aspect of flare statistics . in the waiting - time distributions for the model",
    "were also considered , using theory for jump transition processes presented for the first time by .",
    "it was found that the model produces an essentially poisson ( exponential ) waiting - time distribution .",
    "a modified model was also considered , involving an @xmath20 form for the transition rates .",
    "this model also reproduced the power - law frequency - energy distribution , but exhibited some departure from a simple poisson waiting - time distribution .",
    "master equations may be represented by an equivalent stochastic differential equation @xcite , which provides a complementary approach to the problem at hand .",
    "stochastic des are amenable to solution by monte - carlo methods , which in general are simple to numerically implement .",
    "this paper describes a monte - carlo approach to solving the stochastic model for solar active - region energy presented in and .",
    "the monte - carlo approach has specific advantages over the master - equation approach : it is computationally more efficient , it permits more general modelling , in particular the modelling solution of time - dependent problems , and it generates an ensemble of flare events and hence permits detailed investigation of event statistics .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . the master - equation approach of and",
    "is briefly reiterated in section  [ sec : master - general ] , and the flare - like choices for the model are explained in section  [ sec : master - flare - like ] .",
    "the stochastic de approach to the problem is then presented in section  [ sec : sde - general ] , and illustrated by application to a gaussian test case ( section  [ sec : sde - gauss ] ) , and to the flare - like cases from ( section  [ sec : sde - flare - like ] ) , including comparison of a monte - carlo solution with direct numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "section  [ sec : sde - flare - like - wtd ] presents a monte - carlo - based investigation of the variation of the waiting - time distribution for the flare - like models , and section  [ sec : conclusions ] presents conclusions .",
    "to begin we briefly reiterate the master - equation formulation of the model , following and .",
    "the energy [ @xmath21 of an active region is assumed to be a stochastic variable which evolves in time due to deterministic energy input at a rate @xmath22 , as well as due to jumps downwards in energy ( flares ) at random times and of random sizes , described by transition rates @xmath23 .",

[",
    "a time dependence has been included in the transition rate , by contrast with . ] two other quantities of interest are the mean total rate of transitions ( in the average over energy ) @xmath27 and the mean energy of the system @xmath28    as noted in section  [ sec : introduction ] , two observable flare distributions are the flare frequency - energy distribution and the waiting - time distribution .",
    "the model frequency - energy distribution is given by @xmath29 showed how to obtain the distribution of waiting times ( @xmath30 ) for jump transition models in the steady state ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "in that theory was applied to equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) to yield the model waiting - time distribution @xmath32 .",
    "the details of the derivation are given in .    in and the master equation was numerically solved in the steady state , for flare - like choices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the choices are explained in section  [ sec : master - flare - like ] ) .",
    "the methods of solution involved discretising the energy as a set of values @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , in which case the master equation represents a system of @xmath37 linear equations in @xmath37 unknowns @xmath38 .",
    "solution of the linear system was performed either by relaxation @xcite , or by back substitution @xcite .",
    "one disadvantage of these methods is that the energy may span many decades in energy , in which case a large value of @xmath37 is required .      in",
    ", the master equation was solved in the steady state ( @xmath31 ) for the choices @xmath39 , a constant , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant , @xmath42 is a low - energy cutoff , and @xmath43 is the step function . in equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_wg98 ] )",
    "was generalised to include an additional dependence on the initial energy @xmath9 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant .",
    "the problem was solved for equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_whe08 ] ) with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and for @xmath48 .",
    "the physical motivations for these choices is briefly mentioned in section  [ sec : introduction ] , but is worth discussing in more detail . concerning the energy - supply rate ,",
    "the physical aspect is that the rate does not depend on the energy of the system .",
    "this is appropriate for a system that is externally driven , and for which there is no back reaction of the system on the driver .",
    "the picture for the sun is that energy supply comes from below ( _ i.e. _ from the sub - photosphere ) , _ via _ photospheric flows which cause new fields to emerge into the corona , and twist existing coronal fields .",
    "the rate at which this occurs is determined by flow patterns in the sub - photosphere .",
    "the sub - photosphere is very dense , so it is unlikely that the corona can influence the rate of supply of energy , assuming this picture of energy supply is correct . of course",
    ", the energy supply rate may depend on time , and the choice of a constant supply rate is a simplification .",
    "we will return to the question of time - dependent driving in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "concerning the functional forms for the transition rates , first note that substituting equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_whe08 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : ffe ] ) leads to the flare frequency - energy distribution @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that the frequency - energy distribution is a power law with index @xmath51 up to energies @xmath9 at which @xmath19 becomes very small .",
    "this is consistent with the observed power - law frequency - energy distribution  ( [ eq : obs_pl ] ) , and the physical requirement that the frequency - energy distribution rolls over at large energies ( to ensure the total mean rate of energy release in flares is finite ) .",
    "an estimate of the energy for departure from power - law behavior is provided by the mean energy , which may be approximated by  @xcite @xmath52 in principle , other functional choices leading to power - law behavior are possible , although it has proven difficult to identify alternative solutions with an energy - supply rate independent of energy that produce a power - law form for @xmath53 .",
    "another motivation for the choices  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_wg98 ] ) and  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_whe08 ] ) for the transition rates comes from consideration of avalanche type models  @xcite . in these models",
    "the volume involved in flaring is the set of unstable sites which trigger one another during the flare `` avalanche . ''",
    "the volume of this region is found to be scale free , _",
    "i.e. _ power - law distributed , and is fractal in shape . assuming the volume of the region is proportional to the energy released",
    ", this implies a form @xmath54 for the probability per unit time of a transition from energy @xmath9 to @xmath24 , assuming flares occur at a constant rate per unit time . hence the flare - like choices for the master equation may correspond to the avalanche model , although the detailed relationship between the two pictures remains to be worked out .",
    "some support for these choices is provided by the resulting waiting - time distributions .",
    "the numerical solutions for @xmath19 in lead to waiting - time distributions which are approximately exponential . this may be understood by noting that substituting equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_whe08 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) gives the total rate for flaring @xmath55 for @xmath56 we have @xmath57 for @xmath46 , equation  ( [ eq : lambda_w08_largee ] ) implies @xmath58 is constant ( independent of @xmath9 ) .",
    "for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 , and hence the mean rate may be approximately constant , provided @xmath19 is non - zero only over a fairly limited range in @xmath9 .",
    "hence the total rate of flaring may be approximately constant for @xmath61 and @xmath59 , consistent with a simple poisson process . as discussed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , this is compatible with observed flare statistics in active regions for which the rate does not vary in time @xcite .",
    "following , the master equation  ( [ eq : master ] ) is equivalent to the stochastic differential equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 describes the loss in energy due to flaring , with @xmath64 being the delta function , @xmath65 being the number of events up to time @xmath14 , and with the event times @xmath66 defined by a `` state - dependent '' poisson process with occurrence rate @xmath67 .",
    "the jump amplitudes @xmath68 follow the distribution @xmath69 , defined by @xmath70 so that @xmath71    the ode  ( [ eq : stoch_de ] ) may be solved in the following way .",

    "the energy of the system evolves deterministically from this time up until the first jump at time @xmath74 , where @xmath30 is a waiting time .",

    "the size @xmath68 of the jump may be determined by generating a random variable from the distribution @xmath87 , which is defined by equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) .",

    "for the @xmath61 model it is found that the waiting - time distribution becomes a close approximation to a simple exponential for small @xmath133 .",

    "this result may make the @xmath46 case the preferred flare - like solution , since it is unclear that any such departure is observed for flares on the sun .",
    "also , the dependence of the total flaring rate on the active - region energy for the @xmath140 and @xmath170 models implies variations in flare rate with flare occurrence which do not appear to be observed on the sun .",
    "it is interesting to reconsider the correspondence between the stochastic model and the avalanche model for flares  @xcite , in light of the new results .",
    "the investigation in this paper excludes the possibility of a stochastic model with transition rates of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pl_alpha_whe08_rep ] ) with @xmath5 , which simultaneously exhibits a wide range of flare energies and has uncorrelated waiting times .",
    "this is due to large flares changing the system energy and hence total flaring rate significantly .",
    "the choice for the transition rates was motivated in part by the avalanche model ( as outlined in section  [ sec : master - flare - like ] ) .",
    "avalanche models exhibit power - law frequency - energy distributions over many decades , and they have uncorrelated waiting times  @xcite .",
    "however , in avalanche models the largest flares deplete only a small fraction of of the avalanche grid `` energy '' ( see _ e.g. _ fig .  3 in ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the two pictures might be due to different definitions of energy ( the avalanche model `` energy '' may correspond to free energy plus background magnetic energy unavailable for flares ) .",
    "another possibility is that the @xmath6 model provides the closest match to the avalanche picture",
    ". a more careful analysis of the correspondence between the two models is needed to resolve this point .",
    "the monte - carlo approach has several advantages over solution of the master equation .",
    "first , as discussed in section  [ sec : sde - flare - like ] , the monte - carlo solution is numerically simple to implement and computationally efficient .",
    "second , as highlighted by figure  [ fig : fig8 ] , since the monte - carlo approach produces an ensemble of flare events , it permits detailed investigation of event statistics .",
    "a third advantage of the monte - carlo method is that it permits solution of the model in time - dependent situations . in principle solutions",
    "may be constructed for arbitrary time variation of the rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the methods of solution of the master equation presented in and apply only in the steady state , and in particular the method of obtaining the waiting - time distribution requires a steady state . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , time variation in observed flaring rates plays a role in determining the observed waiting - time distribution , so it is of interest to consider time - dependent models .",
    "these models will be addressed in future work .",
    "it is possible to construct more general stochastic models for active - region energy .",
    "active regions may lose energy by mechanisms other than flaring , _",
    "e.g. _ due to slow ohmic dissipation of electric currents . if the energy loss is considered to be deterministic , and smaller in magnitude than the energy input rate , then @xmath22 in the present model may be interpreted as a _",
    "net _ energy - supply rate , and the model may be considered to already accommodate energy losses of this kind .",
    "if the energy loss is assumed to occur via small random decrements , then a suitable model may be to include a fokker - planck ( diffusion ) term in the master equation , describing continual small random increases and decreases in energy .",
    "( the increases may correspond to fluctuations in the energy supply rate . ) a more general form for the jump - transition master equation , sometimes called the chapman - kolmogorov equation  @xcite includes drift ( representing deterministic energy input or loss ) , diffusion ( small random input or loss ) , and jump transitions .",
    "an active - region model of this form was briefly discussed in . in the context of the monte - carlo approach",
    ", the diffusion term corresponds to a wiener process , and a different method of solution of the stochastic de is then required .",
    "models of the kind presented in this paper are difficult to test in detail against flare observations because of the difficulties associated with determining the free energy of active regions , and the rate of energy supply to active regions .",
    "however , we note that improved solar observations ( and analysis techniques ) may eventually provide such information .",
    "independent of this , the models provide important qualitative checks on our understanding of energy balance in solar active regions .",
    "for example , as noted in section  [ sec : master - flare - like ] , it has proven difficult to identify choices other than the flare - like ones investigated here that produce suitable power - law flare frequency - energy distributions .",
    "the models are also of intrinsic interest because of their description of a dynamical balance involving scale - free transitions , and it is possible that they provide suitable descriptions of a variety of other physical systems exhibiting power - law behavior .",
