    "time - dependent backgrounds are recently getting more important than ever in the study of string theory . actually , spacelike branes  @xcite or a rolling tachyon  @xcite have been attracting a great deal of interest .",
    "some of non - bps objects such as a d - brane - anti - d - brane pair and a non - bps d - brane are by their nature unstable and should become time - dependent under perturbations . since non - bps objects are expected to play important roles in exploration of string dualities beyond the bps level , one would like to study their properties including their dynamics .",
    "hence , it is important to study the dynamics of tachyons living on those objects , as their unstable nature is characterized by the existence of tachyons .",
    "it is not only in exploration of the string duality web but also in exploration of the early universe where tachyons can play important roles .",
    "the so called tachyon cosmology was recently initiated and investigated by many authors  @xcite . in this context",
    "a tachyon can dominate our universe at an early epoch and , thus , the dynamics of tachyons is essential .",
    "the dynamics of a tachyon can actually be described in many different ways .",
    "for example , it was shown by boundary states of an unstable d - brane that the pressure of tachyon fluid approaches zero as the tachyon rolls down  @xcite , it is a field theoretical description  @xcite that has been extensively used in the tachyon cosmology , and it was by using the boundary string field theory ( bsft ) that some exact properties of the tachyon condensation were derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of well - known properties of the tachyon effective action for an unstable d - brane is that the pressure at late time falls off exponentially as the tachyon field evolves from any spatially homogeneous initial configuration towards the minimum of the potential .",
    "this was shown by the boundary states  @xcite , in the field theoretical description with a specific form of the tachyon potential  @xcite , and in the bsft  @xcite although there are some differences in details .",
    "another well - known property is the absence of plane - wave solutions around the minimum of the tachyon effective potential .",
    "this is easily inferred from evidences showing that the minimum describes a configuration without d - branes  @xcite .",
    "the absence of plane - wave solutions was shown in the field theoretical description  @xcite and the bsft  @xcite .    knowing the absence of plane - wave solutions around the minimum , it is interesting to ask how this is achieved from the open string points of view . before the tachyon decay , open strings are dynamical on the world - volume of the unstable non - bps brane . on the other hand , after the tachyon decay , there are no open string states .",
    "hence , it seems natural to ask `` what really happens to open strings in the process of the tachyon decay ? '' in this respect , a non - perturbative confinement mechanism on the brane  @xcite and the classical equivalence between a gauge system and a string fluid  @xcite are very suggestive .    in ref .",
    "@xcite sen conjectured that a tachyonic kink on the world - volume of an unstable d@xmath0-brane is a bps d@xmath1-brane . in this context , the tachyon field for the kink configuration is usually supposed to be static . on the other hand , in the context of the rolling tachyon or the tachyon cosmology , the tachyon is usually spatially homogeneous or nearly homogeneous .",
    "hence , it is interesting to investigate a time - dependent kink , or a highly inhomogeneous rolling tachyon .",
    "it may describe the dynamical formation of the kink as a bps d - brane and , thus , may provide us with more knowledge about the dynamics of the tachyon .",
    "far from the kink , the tachyon condensation is expected to proceed without being affected by the existence of the kink .",
    "hence , to this region the previous works on the homogeneous rolling tachyon can perhaps be applied .",
    "however , it is not clear what dynamically happens to open strings near a kink .    in this paper",
    "we give yet another view on the fate of open strings during tachyon decay .",
    "this view can be applied to the formation process of a tachyonic kink , or inhomogeneous tachyon decay .",
    "our strategy in this paper is to analyze the light - cone structure on the world - volume of an unstable d - brane by using a field theoretical description .",
    "in particular , we compare light - cones governing open strings with those governing closed strings . in this view",
    ", it is shown that open strings except at tachyonic kinks are redshifted away .",
    "on the other hand , open strings on a kink surface remain dynamical but do not feel the existence of the spatial dimension perpendicular to the kink surface .",
    "moreover , open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink during the decay process .",
    "we finally discuss in the context of the tachyon cosmology about a possibility that the early universe has a network of various dimensional d - branes , black - branes and tachyon matter .",
    "a problem associated with the network and a possible solution to the problem are discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : action ] we review an effective field theoretical description of an unstable d - brane and introduce a metric governing open strings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tachyon - decay ] we analyze an inhomogeneous tachyon decay , or a time - dependent kink , and the light - cone structure on the world - volume . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmology ] we discuss some cosmological implications including a problem associated with a d - brane network in the early universe and a possible solution of it .",
    "[ eqn : summary ] is devoted to a summary of this paper .",
    "let us consider the following action of an unstable d(@xmath2)-brane .",
    "@xmath3}| } ,    \\label{eng : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the induced metric on the world - volume of the brane , @xmath5 is the tachyon representing the unstable nature , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent a gauge field and scalar fields confined on the brane , respectively , and @xmath8 is the tachyon potential with vanishing minima at @xmath9 .",
    "note that closed string degrees freedom ( such as gravitons and rr fields ) in the bulk couple to @xmath4 directly but that open string degrees of freedom on the brane ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) always couple to @xmath4 through the combination @xmath10 hence , we have two different metrics on the brane : @xmath4 governing closed string degrees of freedom and @xmath11 governing open string degrees of freedom  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "as we shall see explicitly , light - cone structures of the two metrics can be very different . in the remaining of this paper",
    ", we shall set @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be zero . however",
    ", we shall keep in mind the fact that these open string fields on the brane couple to @xmath11 .    in the rest of this paper , we set @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the action ( [ eng : action ] ) : @xmath14 this is the action considered by many authors in the context of tachyon cosmology .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath15 and the stress energy tensor is @xmath16 the stress energy tensor characterizes how the tachyon couples to gravity .",
    "for example , if we simply add the einstein - hilbert term to the world - volume action or if we consider a spacetime filling brane then @xmath17 appears in the right hand side of einstein equation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we introduce the einstein - hilbert action to a higher - dimensional bulk then gravity is described by the brane - world scenario . in any cases , @xmath17 acts as a source of gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate general feature of light - cone structure on the world - volume of the brane during inhomogeneous tachyon decay without specifying how @xmath17 couples to gravity .",
    "we would like to investigate light - cone structure on the world - volume of an unstable d(@xmath2)-brane with a tachyon decaying inhomogeneously . for simplicity , we consider inhomogeneity in only one spatial dimension .",
    "namely , we assume @xmath1-dimensional plane symmetry .",
    "a general form of the tachyon field and the induced metric within this symmetry is given by @xmath18 for this ansatz , the metric @xmath11 governing open strings is @xmath19 where @xmath20 here a dot and a prime denote derivative with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath23 ( the equality holds if and only if @xmath24 ) .",
    "the future directed null vectors in the @xmath25 direction are @xmath26 for @xmath4 , and @xmath27 for @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the future directed null vectors in the @xmath28 direction are @xmath29 for @xmath4 , and @xmath30 for @xmath11 .    from the above expressions of null vectors",
    ", we can understand many things .",
    "\\(i ) first , if @xmath31 then the light cones of @xmath11 governing open strings are narrower in all directions than those of @xmath4 governing closed strings since @xmath32 .",
    "in general we expect @xmath31 except at kinks if we consider the inhomogeneous tachyon decay .",
    "therefore , open strings except at kinks are redshifted , compared with closed strings . moreover , if @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) as @xmath35 with @xmath22 fixed , then the light cones of @xmath11 governing open strings ( or those of @xmath4 governing closed strings , respectively ) eventually collapse inward in all directions",
    ". when @xmath36 , @xmath37 vanishes if and only if @xmath38 . hence , if @xmath39 then light - cones governing open strings eventually collapse inward in all directions while those governing closed strings remain well - defined . the asymptotic behavior ( [ eqn : asymptotic - condition ] )",
    "is actually satisfied for a homogeneous rolling tachyon ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) . even for an inhomogeneous tachyon decay , once the tachyon starts rolling down , the asymptotic behavior ( [ eqn : asymptotic - condition ] )",
    "is generally expected and was conjectured to be true in ref .",
    "@xcite based on numerical study of the inhomogeneous tachyon decay . on the other hand , it is evident that this condition can not be satisfied at a kink , where @xmath24 .",
    "hence , we can expect the asymptotic behavior ( [ eqn : asymptotic - condition ] ) to be true except in the vicinity of kinks .",
    "therefore , open strings except in the vicinity of kinks are redshifted , compared with closed strings , and will eventually cease to be dynamical .",
    "\\(ii ) secondly , at a kink , @xmath43 since @xmath24 . hence",
    ", light - cones of @xmath11 governing open strings at a kink will be narrowed only in the direction perpendicular to the kink surface .",
    "this , combined with the above consideration ( i ) , implies that open strings on a kink surface can move freely along the kink surface and are dynamical but do not feel the existence of the spatial dimension perpendicular to the kink surface .",
    "\\(iii ) thirdly , near a kink but not on the kink surface we expect that @xmath44 , provided that the top of the tachyon potential is at @xmath45 . to see this , let us consider a simple example of inhomogeneous tachyon decay with a sufficiently smooth initial condition at @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 and @xmath48 of course , appropriate constraint equations must be imposed on the initial condition . for the initial condition",
    ", we expect the tachyon to start rolling down the potential hill except at the kink where @xmath5 and @xmath49 remain to vanish ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kink ] ) . for this simple example , it is evident that @xmath44 near the kink but not on the kink surface .",
    "we expect that this statement is true for a wide class of inhomogeneous tachyon decay if applied to a sufficiently close vicinity of a kink .",
    "hence , @xmath50 near a kink but not on the kink surface , where @xmath51 is the position of the kink and @xmath52 is defined by ( [ eqn : tilden - b - omega ] ) . note that @xmath52 appears in ( [ eqn : upmm ] ) and , thus , the null vectors @xmath53 for @xmath11 near a kink are tilted towards the kink , compared with the null vectors @xmath54 for @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "future - directed light - cones governing open strings near a kink are tilted towards the kink , compared with those governing closed strings .",
    "this indicates that open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink .    in the above three considerations ,",
    "the light - cone structure vividly illustrates how open strings behave during the dynamical formation of a kink .    in ref .",
    "@xcite sen conjectured that a tachyonic kink on the world - volume of an unstable d@xmath0-brane is a bps d@xmath1-brane .",
    "this conjecture seems consistent with the time - dependent kink , or the inhomogeneous tachyon decay , considered above rather than a static kink . actually , if we consider a static configuration ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "hence , it is easily seen that for a static configuration , light - cones of @xmath11 governing open strings are well - defined as far as those of @xmath4 governing closed strings are well - defined and that light - cones of @xmath11 near a kink are not tilted towards the kink at all . hence , open strings on the static kink background can be as dynamical as closed strings : there is no sign of redshift or tendency to move towards the kink . on the other hand , for the time - dependent kink considered above , all three considerations ( i ) - ( iii ) seem to indicate that a lower - dimensional d - brane is dynamically formed at the position of the kink .",
    "in the context of the tachyon cosmology , if the universe starts from the top of the tachyon potential then we expect dynamical formation of the time - dependent tachyonic kink .",
    "in fact , quantum fluctuations kick the background tachyon field to different directions at different points and , as a result , the background tachyon field falls into different vacua in different regions . in this way",
    ", the formation of a network of kinks is expected .",
    "this is exactly like the formation of a network of topological defects in the early universe .",
    "sen s conjecture implies that the kink network is actually a d - brane network .",
    "hence , if the tachyon cosmology is responsible for an early stage of the history of our ( @xmath57-dimensional or higher dimensional ) universe , then our universe experienced an era in which there is a network of d - branes .",
    "on one side of a d - brane and another side , the tachyon is rolling towards its ( different ) vacua and , hence , there is what is called tachyon matter in each region .",
    "this is not the end of the story .",
    "after the d - brane network formation , a loop of d - brane can collapse in principle .",
    "if this happens then it would imply a formation of a network of lower - dimensional d - branes since this process is locally equivalent to a d - brane anti - d - brane annihilation .",
    "actually , a vortex on the world volume of a coincident d@xmath1-brane and anti d@xmath1-brane pair is believed to be a d(@xmath58)-brane  @xcite .",
    "when the lower dimensional d - branes are produced , tachyon matter is again expected to be produced among the newly created d - brane network .",
    "therefore , we expect that at its early stage , the ( @xmath57-dimensional or higher dimensional ) tachyon cosmology has a very rich structure composed of networks of various dimensional d - branes and tachyon matter",
    ". moreover , if the string coupling is strong enough , then these d - branes can be black - branes . in this case",
    ", the d - brane network should be replaced by a network of black - branes .",
    "if the string coupling , or the dilation , is spacetime dependent then the network may be composed of mixture of not only various dimensional d - branes ( without horizons ) and tachyon matter but also various dimensional black - branes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the formation of tachyonic kinks is hazardous in @xmath57-dimensional cosmology . as mentioned in the above , the tachyonic kinks are d - branes ( or black - branes ) .",
    "hence , we can quantitatively investigate how hazardous the formation of the network of tachyonic kinks in the early universe is .    in the @xmath57-dimensional standard cosmology ,",
    "there is a very significant constraint on the mass per unit area , or the tension , in a network of domain walls  @xcite . in general a domain wall",
    "can annihilate with an anti - domain wall if the spacetime is flat and we can wait for a sufficiently long time .",
    "however , the spacetime representing the early universe is not flat but curved .",
    "the universe is actually expanding and , because of the expansion , the annihilation process in the universe can not be completed but has to leave on the order of one domain wall stretching across each hubble radius . hence , the mass of the part of the domain wall network within the present hubble volume is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the tension of the wall and @xmath61 is the present value of the hubble parameter",
    ". this mass must be much smaller than the total mass within the present hubble volume , @xmath62 , since the strongly anisotropic mass distribution of a domain wall can contribute to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "actually , the ratio @xmath63 must be smaller than the cmb anisotropy : @xmath64 hence , we obtain the constraint @xmath65    now let us apply the constraint ( [ eqn : constraint ] ) to the d - brane network .",
    "for simplicity , we consider an unstable d@xmath66-brane in @xmath67-dimension and , hence , the network of bps d@xmath68- ( and anti - d@xmath68- ) branes .",
    "we compactify six extra dimensions to obtain @xmath57-dimensional universe with a network of @xmath69-branes . in this case ,",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the string scale , @xmath73 is the string coupling constant and @xmath74 is the volume of the six extra dimensions .",
    "hence , the constraint ( [ eqn : constraint ] ) is reduced to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the volume of the six extra dimensions in the string unit .",
    "we have another constraint from the fact that we do not observe the tower of kaluza - klein modes : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the mass of the lightest kaluza - klein mode .",
    "this constraint is written as @xmath79 combining this with the previous constraint , we obtain @xmath80 there are values of the string coupling constant @xmath73 allowed by this inequality if and only if @xmath81 .",
    "this would require that the extra dimensions should be much smaller than the string length .",
    "hence , the constraints can not be satisfied by parameter values for which the low energy description is valid .",
    "so far we have not yet taken into account effects of rr fields .",
    "however , since an rr field couples to the tachyon through the interaction of the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a function of the tachyon field @xmath5 and @xmath84 is the ( @xmath2)-form potential , the rr field can be excited by the tachyon decay .",
    "hence , the effect of the rr field is one of important ingredients of the tachyon cosmology .",
    "progress in this direction and its cosmological implications will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "now we would like to propose a possible solution to the d - brane network problem addressed in the above .",
    "a basic idea is that an rr field can play the role of a positive cosmological constant .",
    "first , for simplicity , let us consider a spacetime filling brane ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "in this case , after the tachyon decay , the ( @xmath86)-form rr flux is constant and plays the role of a positive cosmological constant @xmath87 . since the rr flux can be excited by the tachyon decay , we can expect a positive @xmath87 .",
    "this may solve the d - brane network problem in the tachyon cosmology .",
    "however , a problem now is how to reduce @xmath87 to almost vanishing value after the d - brane network problem is solved .",
    "we have to rely on other mechanisms like brown - teitelboim mechanism  @xcite to reduce the value of @xmath87 .",
    "second , if we consider an unstable brane with less dimensions ( @xmath88 ) , then the ( @xmath86)-form after the tachyon decay is no longer a constant .",
    "however , it may still play the role of a positive cosmological constant for a while if the decay of the rr field is not too rapid .",
    "a question now is whether the time scale of the decay of the rr field is long enough to solve the d - brane network problem .    in both cases ,",
    "further investigation of the d - brane network problem and its solution is necessary  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated light - cone structure on the world - volume of an unstable d - brane with a tachyon decaying inhomogeneously by using a field theoretical description .",
    "it has been shown that ( i ) light - cones governing open strings are narrower than those governing closed strings and will eventually collapse inward in all directions except at kinks , where the tachyon remains at the top of its potential ; that ( ii ) light - cones governing open strings at a kink will be narrowed only in the direction perpendicular to the kink surface ; and that ( iii ) future - directed light - cones governing open strings near a kink are tilted towards the kink , compared with those governing closed strings . the result ( i )",
    "implies that open strings except at kinks are redshifted , compared with closed strings , and will eventually cease to be dynamical . on the other hand",

    "indicates that open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink . in this way",
    ", the light - cone structure vividly illustrates how open strings behave during the dynamical formation of a kink .",
    "finally , we have also discussed about a possibility that the early universe has a network of various dimensional d - branes , black - branes and tachyon matter .",

    "<S> we investigate light - cone structure on the world - volume of an unstable d - brane with a tachyon decaying inhomogeneously by using a field theoretical description . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that ( i ) light - cones governing open strings are narrower than those governing closed strings and will eventually collapse inward in all directions except at kinks , where the tachyon remains at the top of its potential ; and that ( ii ) light - cones governing open strings at a kink will be narrowed only in the direction perpendicular to the kink surface . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that ( iii ) future - directed light - cones governing open strings near a kink are tilted towards the kink , compared with those governing closed strings . the result ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> implies that open strings except at kinks are redshifted , compared with closed strings , and will eventually cease to be dynamical . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the result ( ii ) shows that open strings on a kink surface can move freely along the kink surface and are dynamical but do not feel the existence of the spatial dimension perpendicular to the kink surface . </S>",
    "<S> the result ( iii ) indicates that open strings near a kink have tendency to move towards the kink . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the light - cone structure vividly illustrates how open strings behave during the dynamical formation of a kink . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss about a possibility that the early universe has a network of various dimensional d - branes , black - branes and tachyon matter . a problem associated with the network and a possible solution to the problem </S>",
    "<S> are discussed .    </S>"
