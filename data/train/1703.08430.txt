    "present universe constitutes various known and unknown components and matters . one of the most relevant matter called strange quark matter ( sqm ) , which contains a large quantity of deconfined quark in @xmath3-equilibrium , with electric charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "this deconfined quark matter composed of an equal number of up , down quarks and strange quarks .",
    "these quarks may be the true ground state of matter at high - density @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that in the early stages of the universe , during phase transition of the universe one transition occurred called quark - hadron phase transition , in which quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) transformed to hadron gas at temp @xmath4 .",
    "there are two approaches of strange quark matter creation : one is the aforesaid phase transition and another one is the strange matter made from the neutron star at ultra - high density @xcite . in the medium - dependent quark mass scale , the components of quark mass function are its chemical potential and temperature .",
    "these finite chemical potentials presently encounter serious problems .",
    "to resolve this , some effective phenomenological models are commonly used : mit bag model @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . in bag model ,",
    "all corrections of pressure and energy functions of sqm have been corrected through the introduction of ad - hoc bag function . in the framework of this model , farhi and jaffe @xcite",
    "have studied the strange quark matter with its equation of state . in this model ,",
    "the broken physical vacuums take place inside the hadrons on the basis of strong interaction theories .",
    "it gives essentially different vacuum energy densities inside and outside of hadron , and on the bag wall , the pressure of quarks are equilibrated through vacuum pressure and stabilizes the system .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of the sqm depends upon the system pressure and various chemical potential components and the degenerate fermi gasses .",
    "these fermi gases are referred as the replacement of quarks , which can survive only in a region with a vacuum energy density @xmath5 ( bag constant ) .",
    "the unit of bag constant is @xmath6 and it lies in the range 60 - 80 @xmath6 @xcite . in this study , we have assumed the value of @xmath5 to be 60 @xmath6 . by considering the quarks",
    "are massless and non - interacting in a simplified bag model , the quark pressure can be defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the quark energy density",
    ". then the total energy density and pressure gave as + @xmath9 hence the eos for strange quark matter @xcite is @xmath10 again one of the most significant and widespread component of the universe is magnetic field , which possessed by milk way galaxies and many other spiral galaxies along with some common properties of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , the main focus of research is on the effectiveness of strong magnetic field on the special properties of dense quark matter , neutron star matter @xcite and on the stability of strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "dey et al .",
    "@xcite have been introduced the quark matter in strong magnetic field .",
    "when the electromagnetic scale become the order of the nuclear scales ( @xmath11 ) , then some substantial changes appeared in the properties of strange matter . in ref @xcite ,",
    "the quark matter has been studied in the strong magnetic field with phenomenological bag model and found that if the order of the strength of the magnetic field is greater than some critical value , the stability of sqm becomes more . in literature",
    ", it has been accepted that the presence of magnetic field causes an anisotropy in pressure and the bag model can be considered as best satisfactory approach to study magnetized strange quark matter ( msqm ) @xcite . furthermore , the msqm has been studied through the generalization of quasiparticle model @xcite , where they found a density and magnetic - field - dependent bag function , which gives maximum saturated density at quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) scale parameter greater than 123 mev .",
    "recent observations including supernovae - ia , cmb , bao , and lss have predicted the conceptual evidence against the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . whereas , from the last century",
    ", the modern cosmology is based only on the recent observations regarding accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the first reason behind this is the presence of an unknown form of matter and energy driven through negative pressure .",
    "secondly , modification in the gravitational sector of the theory can also be considered as one of the good candidate for explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "some relevant alternative theories are brans - dicke ( bd ) , scalar - tensor theories of gravitation , @xmath12 gravity @xcite , @xmath13 gravity @xcite , @xmath14 gravity @xcite , @xmath15 gravity , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the scalar curvature , the torsion scalar and the gauss - bonnet scalar tensor theory respectively .",
    "the recent generalisation of @xmath12 gravity along with trace of stress energy momentum tensor is known as @xmath0 gravity proposed by harko et al . in 2011",
    "in this theory , the matter lagrangian consists of an arbitrary function of the curvature scalar @xmath16 and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17 . in literature , many cosmological models have been studied in the framework of @xmath0 gravity , either in presence of various matter distributions and metrics @xcite or through energy conditions @xcite .",
    "recently , many authors also have studied the properties of quark matter and strange quark matter in the account of general relativity as well as various modified gravitational theories .",
    "in general theory of relativity , the strange quark matter has been studied along with cosmic string cloud for axially symmetric space - time by katore @xcite and again attached to both string cloud and domain wall for spherically symmetric kink space - time by sahoo and mishra @xcite . in @xmath12 theory of gravity , the behaviour of quark and",

    ". in particular , agrawal and pawar @xcite have studied the quark and strange quark matter for a lrs bianchi i metric in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "they have solved the field equations using constant deceleration parameter . in the early seventies , cosmology was defined for searching two numbers : the present universe expansion rate @xmath19 and deceleration parameter ( dp ) @xmath20 @xcite . among all the observations , the best fit and most natural model to specify the accelerated expansion of the universe is @xmath21cdm model .",
    "this model predicts the value of dp @xmath22 , while the other cdm models predict @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath20 is determined to a precision of @xmath24 by the group of supernovae cosmology project and the high @xmath25 supernovae team in which the distant type ia supernovae ( @xmath26 ) used as standard candles . since the fate of the universe remains still undefined , the reasonable accuracy of these values is limited to analyze all . to predict the fate of the universe we need not only the current numeric values of the parameters but their time dependence is too .",
    "the hubble parameter and dp are the simplest cosmographic parameters , which allows testing the coincidences between the cosmological model with cosmological principle .",
    "these can be defined through the taylor series expansion of scale factor at the present time @xmath27 .",

    "since we are interested in the expansion regime , then in the constant dp : if @xmath30 , the age of the universe will be less than the hubble time and decelerate one , if @xmath31 expansion occurs at constant rate and the age equals to hubble time , if @xmath32 the acceleration of the universe exhibits power - law expansion , exponential if @xmath33 and super - exponential if @xmath34 .",
    "in the context of constant dp , berman @xcite , berman and gomide @xcite proposed the law of variation of hubble parameter in general relativity that yields constant dp ( @xmath35 is a constant ) .",
    "the constant dp is commonly used by cosmologist in literature with various aspects . in order to make more detailed description of the kinematics of cosmological expansion , it is useful to consider various forms of time dependence deceleration parameter .",
    "one of the most popular form is known as linearly varying deceleration parameter ( lvdp ) .",
    "linear parametrization of the dp represents quite naturally .",
    "the next logical step towards the behaviour of future model is either it expands forever or ends with a big rip in finite future .",
    "this can be parametrized with redshift parameter @xmath25 , cosmic scale factor @xmath36 and with cosmic time @xmath37 .",
    "it is used in bianchi type - v cosmological model with of holographic dark energy to escape the big rip singularity @xcite .",

    "@xcite has been studied the homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi type - i cosmological model in the presence of viscous fluid source of matter , which started with a big bang and ends in a big rip .",
    "the kinematical behaviour of lvdp along with null energy condition ( nec ) has been explored in the framework of @xmath38 gravity for bianchi type -i and v space - time @xcite .",
    "akarsu et al .",
    "@xcite have been described the fate of the universe through parametrization @xmath39 , which is linear in cosmic time @xmath37 , along with two well - known additional parametrization of the dp @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath25 and @xmath36 are the redshift parameter and scale factor respectively .",
    "furthermore , they studied the dynamics of the universe in comparison with the standard @xmath21cdm model .",
    "the present work is an extension of the previous work of sahoo and sivakumar @xcite where the model was discussed for perfect fluid source . here",
    ", we have considered the magnetic field coupled with strange quark matter and obtained the cosmological model for linearly cosmic time parametrization of the deceleration parameter .",
