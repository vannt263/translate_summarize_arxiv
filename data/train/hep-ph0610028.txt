    "the calculation of cross sections in the standard model and its extensions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbation theory inevitably involves computing virtual loop feynman diagrams .",
    "the standard method for this involves computing the loop integrals analytically .",
    "once the one loop amplitude is known analytically , the result can be inserted into a calculation of the cross section in which integrals over the momenta of final state particles are performed numerically .",
    "this is the method that was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is used , for example , in the packages mcfm @xcite and nlojet++ @xcite .",
    "this approach is powerful and has been successfully applied to a number of processes of experimental interest .",
    "there has been considerable progress @xcite in expanding the range of processes for which an analytical answer is known .",
    "one may hope that the analytical approach may develop into a completely automatic way of generating scattering amplitudes for a wide class of processes .",
    "however , the complexity of the results produced by known analytical methods grows rapidly with the number of partons involved in the scattering . for this reason",
    ", there may be limits to the range of processes for which analytical methods are useful .",
    "one wonders whether a wider range of processes might be amenable to calculation if one were , instead , to use numerical integration for the virtual loop integrals . in a calculation of a cross section , the numerical integration",
    "would be performed along with the integrations over the momenta of final state particles , so that there would be a single integration over a large number of variables , with the integration performed by monte carlo style numerical integration .",
    "the purely numerical approach will inevitably have its limitations , just as the analytical approach does .",
    "however the nature of the limitations will be different .",
    "for this reason , we believe that one should try to develop the numerical method as far as possible and see how far back the limitations can be pushed .",
    "eventually , this should involve trying several variations on the basic theme of performing the integrations numerically .",
    "there are already some methods available for doing the virtual loop integrals numerically . in one method @xcite , one performs the integral over the energy flowing around the loop analytically by closing the integration contour in the upper or lower half plane and evaluating the residues of the poles in the complex energy plane that come from the propagator denominators .",
    "this is a purely algebraic step .",
    "then the integral over the space momentum is performed numerically .",
    "there are infrared divergences , but these cancel inside the integrals between real and virtual graphs that make up a nlo cross section .",
    "this method has been applied to @xmath4 and is completely practical in that application . for more complicated processes",
    ", we do not know how to arrange a calculation in this style without subtractions .",
    "one could add subtractions to the method of refs .",
    "@xcite , but for this paper we have chosen a different approach .",
    "another method @xcite involves transforming the loop integral into the standard feynman parameter representation that one uses for analytically evaluating such integrals .",
    "then the integral over the feynman parameters is to be performed numerically .",
    "this method shows promise , but is limited by the complexity introduced by expanding the numerator functions involved .",
    "the method introduced in this paper makes use of the feynman parameter representation while avoiding the complexities introduced by the numerator function .",
    "this paper represents the second step of a program for calculating virtual loop integrals numerically . in the first step @xcite",
    ", we attacked the problem of infrared divergences .",
    "typically , the integrals that one wants to evaluate have infrared divergences associated with the momenta of particles in the loop becoming collinear with the momenta of massless external particles or becoming soft . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a subtraction scheme in which one subtracts certain counter terms from the integrand , then adds these same counter terms back . after summing over graphs and performing the integrals analytically , the counter terms that we added back",
    "have a simple form that is easily included in the calculation of a cross section .",
    "meanwhile , the main integrand minus the counter term integrands combine to make an integrand that is free of singularities strong enough to make the integral divergent . thus one can numerically integrate the main integrand minus the counter - term integrands .    despite the beauty of this approach , it is one thing to say that one can numerically integrate the combined integrand and it is another thing to do it .",
    "one needs a practical method for doing it .",
    "that is what we propose in this paper .    in order to keep our discussion reasonably simple ,",
    "we attack a simple problem in which the counter terms are not present because the original integral is infrared finite .",
    "the problem is to compute the amplitude in quantum electrodynamics for scattering of two photons to produce @xmath5 photons by means of an electron loop .",
    "our formulas include the possibility of a non - zero electron mass , but in order to face up to the problem of infrared singularities that appear when the electron mass vanishes , we concentrate on the mass zero case .    the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nphoton ] .",

    "@xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the propagator denominators provide factors that would lead to logarithmic divergences after integration over the soft and collinear regions .",
    "however , these divergences are cancelled . for each electron line",
    "there is a factor @xmath14 .",
    "thus the numerator provides a factor that removes the soft divergence from the integration region @xmath15 .",
    "similarly at each vertex there is a factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the polarization vector of the photon . in the collinear limit @xmath18",
    ", this gives a factor @xmath19 .",

    "the only property that we really need is that @xmath34 is a polynomial in @xmath9 .",
    "it will prove convenient to modify this by inserting factors @xmath35 in the numerator and the denominator , where @xmath36 is an arbitrary parameter that we can take to be of the order of a typical dot product @xmath37 .",
    "this factor is not absolutely needed for the purposes of this paper , but it is quite useful in the case of the subtraction terms to be considered in future papers and is at least mildly helpful in the analysis of this paper . with this extra factor , we write @xmath38",

    "there are many reasons for this , but the most important is that we do not have just _ any _ function but a function with a known singularity structure , a structure that is generic to loop diagrams in quantum field theory with massless kinematics .",

    "since @xmath211 can be very large near other lines associated with double parton scattering , we also need to arrange that @xmath200 is similarly large near these lines .",
    "we construct the desired density in the form @xmath212 here @xmath213 , the sum of the @xmath214 is 1 , and there are several density functions @xmath215 with @xmath216 .",

    "the determinant condition then implies that @xmath497 and @xmath498 have the same sign .",
    "in fact , this sign must be negative . to see this",

    "we conclude that for a double parton scattering singularity , @xmath495 and @xmath495 , @xmath503 and @xmath504 .",
