    "the fukushima dai - ichi nuclear power plant accident , which began in march 2011 , released a significant amount of radioactive substances , contaminating fukushima and surrounding prefectures  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to clarify the extent of this fallout and to assess its impact on the environment , foodstuffs , and on the residents in the affected areas . in fukushima prefecture ,",
    "various studies of external as well as internal exposures have been conducted since 2011  @xcite . particularly important in assessing the effect of radiation on the residents",
    "is to conduct personal dosimetry : one of the earliest reports was by yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite , who measured the individual doses of the medical staff dispatched from nagasaki to fukushima city from march to july 2011 .",
    "they reported that the personal dose equivalent @xmath0(10 ) ranged from 0.08 to 1.63 @xmath1sv / h , significantly lower than the ambient dose equivalent rate @xmath2(10 ) recorded by a monitoring station in fukushima city which ranged from 0.86 to 12.34 @xmath1sv / h .    large - scale individual dose monitorings have been conducted by most municipalities in fukushima prefecture since 2011 .",
    "for example , fukushima city started to distribute radio - photoluminescence glass dosimeters ( glass badge^^ ) to school children and pregnant women in the fall of 2011 , and the monitorings have been repeated every year .",
    "the percentage of the subjects whose measured `` additional '' dose was below 1  msv / y was 51% in 2011 , 89% in 2012 , and 93% in 2013 . in 2014 , 95.57% of the 46,436 subjects were found to be below 1  msv / y  @xcitecs , having a half life of 2 years , and also to the decontamination efforts . ] .",
    "such individual dose monitoring using passive dosimeters report a cumulative dose over a period of time , typically three months , to the participant ; it is not possible to tell when and where the major contribution to the cumulative dose was received . in the present study",
    ", we therefore used active ( solid - state ) personal dosimeters called `` d - shuttle '' , which can record the integrated dose for each hour ( hourly dose ) .",
    "the d - shuttles had already been used successfully in some studies .",
    "for example , hayano et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the effectiveness of using d - shuttles to communicate the exposure situation to residents , and naito et al .",
    "@xcite used d - shuttles together with global - positioning system ( gps ) receivers to compare individual versus ambient dose equivalent rates .    in the present study ,",
    "216 high - school students and teachers wore d - shuttles and kept journals of their behaviour for two weeks in 2014 , and the external individual doses thus obtained were compared across the regions .",
    "this study was motivated and initiated by the high - school students living in fukushima who wished to compare their own individual doses with those of people living in other parts of japan , and also in other countries .",
    "the measurements were carried out by high - school students and teachers from twelve japanese high schools ( six in fukushima prefecture , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fukushima ] , and six outside of fukushima , see fig .",
    "[ fig : outoffukushima ] ) , four high schools ( three regions ) in france ( fig .",
    "[ fig : france_background ] ) , eight high schools ( seven regions ) in poland ( fig .  [ fig : poland_background ] ) and two high schools in belarus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : belarus ] ) .",
    "the total number of participants was 216 , and the measurement period was two weeks during the school term in each country . .",
    "the six japanese schools outside fukushima prefecture were chosen by consulting the `` geological map of japan '' ( fig .  [ fig : outoffukushima ] , a natural radiation level map published by the geological society of japan  @xcite ) .",
    "fukuyama ( labelled 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : outoffukushima ] ) , tajimi ( 4 . ) and ena ( 5 . )",

    "[ fig : fukushima ] ) , schools in major cities , fukushima , nihonmatsu , koriyama , iwaki , aizu were selected .",
    "note that some 100,000 people were forced to evacuate from the restricted zone ( indicated by the white border in fig .",
    "[ fig : fukushima ] ) , who , after four years of the accident , can not yet return to their homes . as such , the present study does * not * include high schools in the restricted zones .",
    "when choosing the participants from fukushima prefecture high schools , care were taken so as to choose students living in various areas , house types ( wooden vs concrete ) , and in their extracurricular activities .    in france and poland ,",
    "the high schools involved in the study participated on a voluntary basis without specific selection . in france , the four high schools are located in three different regions characterized by a range of natural terrestrial radiation background level , the lowest level being observed in boulogne ( closed to paris ) while higher value is observed in corsica ( see figure  [ fig : france_background ] ) . in poland",
    ", the location of the schools is also ranging from lower values for high schools in the region of warszawa to the highest in zabrze ( see figure  [ fig : poland_background ] ) .",
    "two high schools from belarus were involved due to their location in the gomel region , impacted by the fallout of the chernobyl accident .",
    "the first high school is located in gomel city while the second one is located close to the exclusion zone ( in bragin district ) and thus characterized by a higher ambient radiation dose rate ( see figure  [ fig : belarus ] ) .",
    "the individual dose - meter , called `` d - shuttle '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dshuttle ] ) , developed jointly by the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology ( aist ) and chiyoda technol corporation is a light ( 23 g ) and compact ( 68 mm ( h ) @xmath3 32 mm ( w ) @xmath3 14 mm ( d ) ) device , based on a @xmath4 mm@xmath5 silicon sensor , and is capable of logging the integrated dose every hour in an internal memory with time stamps  @xcite .",
    "the memory can be later read out by using a computer interface . by comparing the data with the activity journal kept by the participant",
    ", we can analyse the relationship between the personal dose and behaviour ( when , where , and what ) of the participant .",
    "each d - shuttle was calibrated with a @xmath6cs calibration source for @xmath0(10 ) , in accordance with the international organization for standardization ( iso 4037 - 3 )  @xcite .",
    "the relative response is 30% from 60 kev to 1.25 mev , and its least detectable value was 0.01@xmath1sv / h .",
    "the @xmath0(10 ) measured with a personal dosimeter such as d - shuttle is known not to underestimate the effective dose @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) even in cases of lateral or isotropic radiation incidence on the body , as in the present study  @xcite .",
    "although the d - shuttle is well shielded against external electromagnetic noise and is protected against mechanical vibration , occasional spurious `` hits '' are unavoidable .",
    "these typically show up as an isolated large `` spike '' in the readout data . in such cases",
    ", we checked the activity journal and queried the participant to determine whether or not the `` spike '' was likely caused by radiation , as will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : outliers ] .",
    "participants were instructed to always wear the d - shuttle on his / her chest , except during sleep when the unit was left near the bedside . in table  [ tab : rawdata ] , typical data read out from the d - shuttle are shown together with a part of the activity journal .",
    "the number of data points per participant was 24 h @xmath9 d = 336 . as there were some participants who could not take part in the measurements for the full 14 days , the total number of data points for the 216 people were 70,879 .",
    "the d - shuttle records both natural radiation and the radiation due to the accident ( @xmath10cs ) ; the latter contribution is negligible except in fukushima prefecture and in belarus . when comparing the individual doses across the regions , we used the recorded doses by the d - shuttle including both doses from natural background radiation and radiation from radiocaesiums , since these two contribute inseparably and additively to the individual doses .",
    "in this way , in addition to using the same device and standardising the measurement protocol , it is possible to compare the individual doses across all the participating regions .",
    ".[tab : rawdata ] a typical example of a d - shuttle data . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "show that the personal doses for the high school students from fukushima prefecture were not significantly higher than in other regions and countries .",
    "this may seem surprising since there are still contributions from radioactive caesium in fukushima , as airborne monitoring and other measurements clearly show .    in order to better understand the situation , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : estimateddose ] the estimated air kerma for the 12 participating schools in japan , using the database of chemical analysis of soil samples  @xcite .",
    "we selected the soil - sample data within 5  km of participating schools from the database ( when there were multiple sampling points , we took their average ) , and used the equation @xmath11 to estimate the air kerma @xmath12 ( ngy / h ) , with @xmath13 being the @xmath14k concentration ( in % ) , @xmath15 being the uranium concentration ( in ppm ) and @xmath16 being the thorium concentration ( in ppm )  @xcite . the relation between the air kerma and the effective dose varies depending on the irradiation angle to the body ( c.f . , icrp publication 74 ( 1996)@xcite , figure 9 ) . as people almost evenly receive terrestrial background radiation from all sides ,",
    "rotational irradiation geometry is adequate for the relation .",
    "although effective dose per unit air kerma ( sv / gy ) at rotational geometry is around 0.9 in the energy region of terrestrial background radiation ( c.f . , ibid .",
    "two - dot chain line of figure 8) , it can be treated as unity without losing the rationality of our argument , since the difference lies within the uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "as shown , outside of fukushima , the estimated effective dose rates from the terrestrial radiation air kerma rates and measured individual dose rates are correlated and have similar values .",
    "however , in fukushima , the individual dose rates are higher than the estimated effective dose rates of terrestrial radiation .",
    "in fact , the terrestrial radiation background is low in fukushima ; the radiation due to the distributed radio - caesium was added on top of the terrestrial radiation , but that increment is not high as might be expected .",
    "thus , although the dose rate in most of fukushima prefecture was elevated by the nuclear accident , the total external individual dose rates observed for the fukushima high school students involved in this study are not significantly different from those in other regions .",
    "the natural radiation levels vary from region to region . in japan",
    ", the nation - wide average of the terrestrial gamma - ray contribution to the effective dose is evaluated to be 0.33 msv / y  @xcite , lower than the world average of 0.48  msv / y  @xcite . in france , the average value is 0.47 msv / y , similar to the world average but with variation from a factor 5 according the regions , ranging from about 0.2 to 1 msv / y  @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the d - shuttle measured the sum of the natural radiation dose and the additional dose due to the nuclear accident , if any was detectable .",
    "nevertheless , in fukushima as well as in belarus , the individual annual dose _ including natural radiation _ was below 1 msv / y for most of the participating high - school students .",
    "it is interesting to mention that icrp stated in publication 111 that `` past experience has demonstrated that a typical value used for constraining the optimisation process in long - term post - accident situations is 1 msv / year ''  @xcite .",
    "twelve high schools in japan ( of which six are in fukushima prefecture ) , four in france , eight in poland and two in belarus cooperated in the measurement and comparison of individual external doses in 2014 . in total 216 high - school students and teachers participated in the study .",
    "each participant wore an electronic personal dosimeter `` d - shuttle '' for two weeks , and kept a journal of his / her whereabouts and activities .",
    "the median annual doses were estimated to be 0.63 - 0.97 msv / y in fukushima prefecture , 0.55 - 0.87 msv / y outside of fukushima in japan , 0.51 - 1.10 msv / y in europe ( 0.09 in belarus ) , thus demonstrating that the individual external doses currently received by participants in fukushima and belarus are well within the terrestrial background radiation levels of other regions / countries .",
    "the present study also demonstrated that the measurement of individual dose rates together with the use of activity journals is a powerful tool for understanding the causes of external exposures , and can be useful and clearly understandable tool for risk communication for people living in contaminated areas .",
    "the stacked bars show the estimated natural radiation level ( ngy / h ) around the participating schools , based on the soil - sample chemical analysis database ( n.b .",
    "since those soil samples were collected from riverbeds , the estimated radiation levels may not necessarily coincide with the typical values in residential areas )  @xcite .",
    "the individual hourly dose ( nsv / h ) distribution measured at each school is indicated by the box diagrams ( same as in fig .",
