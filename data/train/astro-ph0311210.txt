    "the study of the earliest stages of massive star formation ( msf ) is one of the most exciting subjects of present research in this field . whether the dominant formation process for massive stars is disk accretion ( see e.g. @xcite ) or coalescence @xcite is still an open question .",
    "the presence of outflows in regions of massive star formation favours , however , the first scenario .",
    "similarly to previous surveys ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) , we have searched for msf candidates located near bright iras sources using scuba and iram bolometers ( @xcite and klein et al .",

    ", we discovered a deeply embedded object ( uyso  1 , for _ unidentified young stellar object  1 _ ) , powering a high - velocity bipolar co outflow .",
    "the iras source is located in the bright hii region s  297 , illuminated by the b1ii / iii star hd  53623 @xcite .",
    "uyso  1 is located very close to the edge of a dark cloud .",
    "co(@xmath3 ) line mapping of uyso  1 was carried out with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii , in october 1999 .",
    "the facility receiver b3 ( 315 - 373 ghz ) was used as frontend , the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) as backend . with a total bandwidth of 250 mhz , centered on v@xmath4  km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the maps were obtained in position - switch mode with an off - position 10 to the east .",
    "map sampling was at intervals of 10 , the total on+off integration time was 10 min , the beam efficiency @xmath6 , and the beam size was 14 .",
    "additionally , scuba continuum observations at @xmath7  @xmath8 m and @xmath9  @xmath8 m were performed with a total integration time of 46 minutes . here ,",
    "beam sizes were 8 and 14 , respectively . based on six different field scans with different chop throws ,",
    "noise was minimised using the emerson  ii technique @xcite . in march 2003 , additional cs(@xmath10 ) , cs(@xmath11 ) , sio(@xmath10 ) and especially h@xmath12co(@xmath13)/(@xmath14 ) observations were obtained at the iram 30 m telescope using the b100 , b230 , a100 and a230 receivers .",
    "the raster map sampling was the same as for the jcmt observations , though a smaller range of offset positions was observed .",
    "the center position is shifted southward by 6.4 when compared to the jcmt map .",

    "the overlaid scuba map at 850 @xmath8 m displays uyso 1 as a compact emission peak at @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 , between s  297 and the dark cloud .",
    "in addition to this , two dusty filaments are visible at 850  @xmath8 m .",
    "the eastern filament contains the iras point source position , the western one is located inside the dark cloud .",
    "uyso 1 is still invisible at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths : no infrared point source in the @xmath182.2 .. 20  @xmath8 m range is visible in 2mass and msx images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , b ) , but some faint `` reflected '' light can be seen in the 2mass @xmath19-band image .",
    "it can not be ruled out , however , that this is captured h@xmath12 line emission , e.g. tracing cloud surfaces and outflows . neither the iras , nor the 2mass , nor the msx infrared survey point source catalogues resulted in detections at the uyso 1 position .",

    "instead , the envelope seems to be compressed towards the hii region east of it .",
    "the co peak is roughly 10 off the scuba peak position .",
    "the line wing map displays a bipolar outflow in the nw - se direction , its origin being uyso  1 at raster coordinates [ 0,-10 ] , taking the emission peak of the complete integrated line as definition .",
    "the outflow is not clearly visible in the cs data , possibly due to the average density being below the cs critical densities .",
    "lines on corresponding positions have , however , corresponding shapes .",
    "sio(@xmath10 ) could only be detected at the position [ -10 , 16.4 ] , in the outer regions of the redshifted outflow lobe .",
    "possibly , this is due to a bow shock caused by the outflow colliding with the local interstellar medium .",

    ", we can not decide whether the bipolar outflow is composed of only one or more components ( cf .",

    "from the co(@xmath3 ) observations , the object mass and outflow parameters can be deduced .",

    "however , while the distance to the illuminating star of s  297 , namely hd  53623 , was spectroscopically determined to be 2.2  kpc @xmath27 25% by @xcite , hipparcos measured a parallax for hd  53623 of @xmath28 mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath29  pc @xcite . assuming the true distance is near the upper limit of this interval , we adopt a value of 1  kpc for the following mass estimates , in accordance with detailed studies of cma  r1 by @xcite and @xcite .    the co data analysis is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , in direct comparison to 2mass-@xmath19 data and the 450  @xmath8 m continuum .      while the main beam temperatures @xmath30 of the highly optically thick co lines already confine the kinetic temperature to the 40 - 50  k range , another estimate was obtained from h@xmath12co(@xmath31)/(@xmath32 )",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the two h@xmath12co transitions for uyso  1 .",
    "the intensity ratio deduced from fitted gaussians is 6 , thus indicating a kinetic temperature of t=40@xmath33  k for a relatively wide range of densities .",
    "assuming virial conditions , i.e. assuming that the observed line width is entirely due to motion in gravitational equilibrium , the total mass of the object can be estimated as described by @xcite . inside a sphere of 0.14  pc radius , corresponding to the 40% contour level ( deconvolved with the 14 beam ) at 10  @xmath26 , and using the gaussian fit result of @xmath34  km  s@xmath5 , a virial mass of @xmath35  m@xmath1 is obtained .",
    "following @xcite , we derive hydrogen column densities from the co(@xmath36 ) transition , assuming a relation of @xmath37  ( @xmath38 .",
    "an underlying assumption is a conversion factor of co(@xmath36 ) / co(@xmath39 ) close to unity , as it is frequently observed in massive star - forming regions and explained by clumpy structure @xcite .",
    "the gas mass of the cloud can then be determined as @xmath40m@xmath41h@xmath42 , where @xmath43 takes into account the interstellar mean molecular weight per h atom .",
    "@xmath44 is the area occupied by the source .    within the same area and to the same confidence level as the virial analysis ,",
    "this leads to a different result for the cloud mass . with an average column density of @xmath45(h@xmath12 )",
    "= @xmath46  @xmath47 the resulting mass is @xmath48  m@xmath1 .",
    "another estimate for the total mass has been calculated from the continuum observations at @xmath9  @xmath8 m . assuming a dust temperature of @xmath49  k and optically thin conditions , @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "using an interpolated opacity of @xmath51  @xmath52/g ( thin ice mantles , @xcite ) , the result is @xmath53  m@xmath1 .",
    "the radius of the region taken into account for this calculation is 0.11  pc ( at a distance of 1  kpc ) , slightly smaller than the 0.14  pc used here .",
    "additionally , the dust continuum emission traces only the high - density central regions while the co emission is collected along the line of sight throughout the low - density halo .",
    "optically thick emission might further influence the estimate ( see  [ sedtext ] ) .",
    "these two points at least partly explain the discrepancy .",
    "thus , the mass estimates based on line and dust emission are compatible when keeping in mind their respective limitations and range between 15 and 40  m@xmath1 .",
    "the virial mass is much higher which is certainly caused by an overestimation of line width due to optical thickness and turbulent motion , in addition to the cloud not being in virial equilibrium .",
    "the two line wings were analyzed to their respective 10% contour levels , corresponding to a 2  @xmath26 detection for the redshifted line wing and a 4  @xmath26 detection for the blueshifted line wing .",
    "the masses inside the two outflow lobes are again calculated by integration of h@xmath12 column densities , resulting in @xmath54  m@xmath1 and @xmath55  m@xmath1 , the total outflow mass thus being @xmath56  m@xmath1 .",
    "the maximum projected velocities of the red and blue line wings are @xmath57  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath58  km  s@xmath5 respectively , the mean value being @xmath59  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "together with the known distance and the outflow radial sizes , the dynamical timescale and the mass loss rate can be obtained . with caution",
    ", the latter can be empirically converted to luminosity , and spectral type as well as mass of an assumed central star .",
    "all values discussed hereafter are summarized in tab .",
    "[ t1 ] for inclinations of @xmath60 @xmath61 ( the most probable value , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath62    when the apparent outflow velocity @xmath63 and the apparent maximum outflow extension have been inclination - corrected to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the dynamical timescale can be calculated from @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting values range from @xmath67  years to @xmath68  years .",
    "however , the timescale estimated this way is not a good age indicator .",
    "only a massive object can uphold mass outflow rates @xmath69 ranging from @xmath70  m@xmath1/yr to @xmath71  m@xmath1/yr .",
    "they can be empirically transformed into the luminosity of the central object according to @xcite , @xcite or , based on a more comprehensive sample , by @xcite .",
    "[ t2 ] summarizes the resulting spectral types , masses and luminosities ( using data by @xcite ) .",
    "however , these properties of the central object can be better determined using the sed ( see  [ sedtext ] )",
    ".    it may be interesting to consider the age of the neighbouring hii region .",
    "following @xcite , this age can be estimated @xcite .",
    "the size of s  297 in the optical regime with a diameter of 7 ( sharpless catalogue ) corresponds to a radius of only about @xmath72  au , hence indicating that the nebula is rather young .",
    "assuming a typical mean density of @xmath73  @xmath25 and a lyman continuum flux for a b1 star from @xcite , the resulting age is approximately @xmath74  yrs .",
    "regardless of the uncertainties in these age estimates , the hii region is likely to be older than uyso  1 .",
    "possibly , this is an example of induced star formation , although this would need kinematic confirmation .",
    "while the two measured continuum fluxes at 450  @xmath8 m and 850  @xmath8 m determine the cold dust emission , more data had to be complemented before the spectral energy distribution could be tentatively compared to modeling results . given the aim of determining the luminosity and mass of the central object as well as having a comparison to the mass determination , upper flux limits for short wavelengths helped pinning down physical properties of the central object . as main support besides the jcmt data , iras fluxes were used , determined at the position of uyso  1 within beam sizes from the iras atlas maps .",
    "uyso  1 is unresolved also on iras hires maps .",
    "additionally , data for the definitely brighter nearby msx point source g225.4582 - 02.5939 and 2mass detection limits set further constraints .    integrating the sed and using the flux limits at infrared wavelengths as",
    "the actual flux values leads to a luminosity of @xmath75  l@xmath1 , assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "a modified blackbody accounting for the dust optical depth was fitted to the data : @xmath76 , with the beam size @xmath77 and with dust opacities @xmath78 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a good fit is obtained for @xmath79  k and @xmath80 , however fits with temperatures between 40 and 50  k are also fitting the data within the uncertainties . with the aim of checking the consistency of existing data ,",
    "the continuum emission was then modeled using the radiative transfer code developed by @xcite .",
    "this is an accelerated version of the 2-d ray - tracing code developed for radiative transfer in disk configurations by @xcite . due to insufficient parameter constraints ,",
    "the code was used in its 1d version only .",
    "the limiting outer radius of the model could be estimated from the co data to be @xmath81  au , taking the same area as for the mass estimation .",
    "assuming an exponential of the density distribution of 2.0 with a dust - to - gas ratio of 1:150 , the model uses silicate optical data from @xcite , while the properties of the carbonaceous dust are from @xcite [ 1000  k data ] .",
    "the ratio of silicates to carbon is 3:2 .",
    "the inner model radius is determined by the dust sublimation temperature of 1500  k.    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the results for an envelope mass of @xmath82  m@xmath1 and an assumed single central object in the b2.5 class .",
    "the optical depth at @xmath83  nm for the simulation runs is @xmath84 .",
    "since the code becomes inaccurate for high optical depths , the computed sed is arbitrarily shown for @xmath85 , corresponding to @xmath86  @xmath8 m . at @xmath9",
    "@xmath8 m , the optical depth is @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the mass estimate from the dust emission in  [ massdet ] is rather a lower limit because of contribution from optically thick emission .",
    "both the simulation and the blackbody fit indicate the equivalent of an early b star as the central object .",
    "this finding is compatible with the result of the empirical outflow analysis for @xmath61 .",
    "the envelope mass in the simulation is compatible with the mass estimate from the co(@xmath3 ) data ( 40  m@xmath1 ) , especially when keeping in mind that the modeled gas density only reaches @xmath88  @xmath25 at its outer radius , thus allowing for a slightly higher envelope mass when integrating further outwards .",
    "the emerging picture of uyso  1 drawn from both mass estimates and subsequent empirical relations as well as sed considerations thus is that of an early b star surrounded by an envelope of about 30 - 40  m@xmath1 .",
    "the object seems to be in a particularly early evolutionary state , but already drives a bipolar outflow with a total mass of m@xmath89  m@xmath1 . to our knowledge , there are only very few comparable sources that are undetected at infrared wavelengths ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . with additional high - resolution observations ,",
    "we hope to be able to specify these conclusions and learn more about this evolutionary state .",
