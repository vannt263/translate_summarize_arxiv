    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is scheduled to begin operation in 2009 , beginning a new era wherein the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation will be revealed and studied in detail . although alternative mechanisms exist in theory , this is generally believed to be a light higgs boson with mass @xmath10  gev  @xcite . more specifically , we expect a fundamental scalar sector which undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking as the result of a potential which acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "the lhc will easily find a light standard model ( sm ) higgs boson with moderate luminosity  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lhc will have the capability to determine some of its properties  @xcite , such as its fermionic and bosonic decay modes and couplings  @xcite , including invisible decays  @xcite and possibly even rare decays to second generation fermions  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath0 linear collider with a center of mass energy of 350  gev or more will be able to significantly improve these preliminary measurements , in some cases by an order of magnitude in precision , if an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath8 can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important measurement after a higgs boson discovery is of the higgs potential itself , which requires measurement of the trilinear and quartic higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "only multiple higgs boson production can probe these directly  @xcite .",
    "several years ago , studies exploring the potential of the lhc , a luminosity - upgraded lhc ( slhc ) with roughly ten times the amount of data expected in the first run , and a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) , have appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "there are also numerous quantitative sensitivity limit analyses of higgs boson pair production in @xmath0 collisions ranging from 500  gev to 3  tev center of mass energies  @xcite , and for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 studies , usually , focus on one particular higgs mass and/or final state , only one center of mass energy , and , in many cases , estimate the background using a leading - log shower approximation .",
    "furthermore , the effects of non - resonant feynman diagrams are not taken into account .    in this paper ,",
    "i present a more thorough investigation of higgs boson pair production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "i calculate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) signal cross sections for @xmath4  tev , 1  tev and 3  tev , and @xmath13  gev , 140  gev and 180  gev , although @xmath14  gev is disfavored by the most recent fit to electroweak data when direct search limits from the tevatron experiments are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "a center of mass energy of @xmath15  tev is considered for the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , whereas @xmath16  tev is the target energy for cern s clic concept  @xcite . only unpolarized electron and positron beams",
    "are considered .",
    "since the cross section for the one - loop process @xmath17 is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for @xmath18 production  @xcite , it is not considered here .",
    "likewise , i will ignore the process @xmath19 ; due to the small @xmath20 coupling , its cross section is about a factor  6 less than that for @xmath21 production  @xcite .",
    "i consider several final states , and estimate both the reducible and irreducible backgrounds using exact matrix element calculations .",
    "special attention is given to the role non - resonant feynman diagrams play , and the theoretical uncertainties of signal and background cross sections .",
    "all calculations are performed taking into account the anticipated resolution of future @xmath0 detectors .",
    "finally , i derive quantitative sensitivity bounds for several integrated luminosities , and compare the capabilities of the considered @xmath0 colliders with each other and those of the lhc , a luminosity upgraded lhc ( slhc )  @xcite , and a very large hadron collider operating at a center of mass energy of 200  tev  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "i first review the definition of the higgs boson self - couplings and briefly discuss sm and non - sm predictions for these parameters in sec .  [",
    "sec : two ] .",
    "the methods and tools used in my calculations , together with the parametrized detector resolution are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] . in secs .",
    "[ sec : four ] and  [ sec : five ] the @xmath18 and @xmath21 signal channels and all relevant backgrounds are discussed .",
    "quantitative sensitivity limits are calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : six ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : seven ] , i finally present my conclusions .",
    "the trilinear and quartic higgs boson couplings @xmath1 and @xmath22 are defined through the potential @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the physical higgs field , @xmath25 is the vacuum expectation value , and @xmath26 is the fermi constant . in the sm",
    "the self - couplings are @xmath27 regarding the sm as an effective theory , the higgs boson self - couplings @xmath1 and @xmath22 are _ per se _ free parameters , and @xmath28-matrix unitarity constrains @xmath22 to @xmath29  @xcite . since future collider experiments likely can not probe @xmath22  @xcite , i concentrate on the trilinear coupling @xmath1 in the following",
    ". the quartic higgs coupling does not affect the higgs pair production processes i consider .    in the sm , radiative corrections decrease @xmath1 by @xmath30 for @xmath31  gev  @xcite .",
    "larger deviations are possible in scenarios beyond the sm . for example , in two higgs doublet models where the lightest higgs boson is forced to have sm like couplings to vector bosons , quantum corrections may increase the trilinear higgs boson coupling by up to @xmath32  @xcite . in the mssm , loop corrections modify the self - coupling of the lightest higgs boson in the decoupling limit , which has sm - like couplings , by up to @xmath33 for light stop squarks  @xcite .",
    "anomalous higgs boson self - couplings also appear in various other scenarios beyond the sm , such as models with a composite higgs boson  @xcite , or in little higgs models  @xcite . in many cases",
    ", the anomalous higgs boson self - couplings can be parametrized in terms of higher dimensional operators which are induced by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "a systematic analysis of higgs boson self - couplings in a higher dimensional operator approach can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "all calculations presented here have been performed at tree - level using madevent  @xcite which has been modified to allow for non - standard values of @xmath1 . for some background calculations it was also necessary to increase the maximum number of feynman diagrams and/or configurations allowed so that madevent could be used successfully .",
    "background calculations involving the strong coupling constant , @xmath34 , were performed with the renormalization scale set to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass of the @xmath37-boson .",
    "the sm parameters used are  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath26 is the fermi constant , @xmath39 is the @xmath40 mass , @xmath41 is the weak mixing angle , and @xmath42 is the electromagnetic coupling constant in the @xmath43 scheme .    the basic kinematic acceptance cuts for events at the ilc and clic are @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angle between the two objects @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the energy , and @xmath50 is the missing transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath50 cut is only imposed on final states where there are one or more neutrinos present .",
    "likewise , the angular and energy cuts on the charged leptons are only imposed if there is at least one charged lepton in the event which does not result from the decay of a charm or bottom quark .    in all calculations ,",
    "i include minimal detector effects by gaussian smearing of the parton momenta according to ilc detector expectations  @xcite @xmath51   { \\delta{e } \\over e}{\\rm ( lep ) }   & = & { 0.102 \\over \\sqrt{e}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and assume that charged leptons and jets can be detected with an efficiency close to 100% .",
    "for the @xmath52-tagging efficiency , @xmath53 , and the associated misidentification probabilities of light quark / gluon jets and @xmath54-quarks to be tagged as a @xmath52-quarks , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , i consider two scenarios  @xcite : @xmath57 and @xmath58 the energy loss in @xmath52-jets due to @xmath52-quark decays is taken into account via a parametrized function  @xcite , and i will assume that @xmath52- and @xmath59-quarks can be distinguished with 100% efficiency .",
    "this should be a good approximation since ilc detectors are expected to be able to measure the electric charge of a @xmath52-jet with an efficiency of 90% or better  @xcite .    the identification of @xmath60 and hadronic @xmath40- and @xmath37-decays plays an important role in separating the @xmath18 and @xmath21 signal from the background . to identify @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays ,",
    "i require ( @xmath63 ) latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : mjj }    invariant mass .",
    "since the energy loss of the @xmath52-jets distorts the @xmath60 breit - wigner function and lowers the @xmath65 invariant mass , i impose @xmath66 this captures most of the signal cross section .",
    "i also assume that , by the time higgs pair production is being analyzed , the higgs boson mass is accurately known from experiments at the lhc and/or an analysis of the process @xmath67 .",
    "initial state radiation and beamstrahlung are not included in any of the calculations presented here .    in order to derive sensitivity limits for @xmath1",
    ", the distribution of higgs - pair invariant mass , @xmath68 , will be used .",
    "the @xmath68 distribution is known to be sensitive to the higgs boson self - coupling , in particular for small values of the higgs - pair mass  @xcite .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the @xmath2 cross section decreases with increasing center of mass energy while @xmath69 increases . for @xmath4  tev , @xmath70 , and for @xmath16",
    "tev , @xmath71 . for @xmath5  tev ,",
    "the two cross sections are of the same order of magnitude , with @xmath72 being the larger source of higgs boson pairs .",
    "i , therefore , consider @xmath18 ( @xmath21 ) production for @xmath73  tev ( @xmath74  tev ) only .",
    "for a center of mass energy of 0.5  tev , higgs pair production is strongly phase space suppressed if @xmath75  gev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14  gev case , therefore , is only analyzed for @xmath74  tev .    as stated before ,",
    "all calculations reported here are carried out at tree level .",
    "the complete one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known  @xcite to modify the lowest cross section by a few percent for the energy range considered in this paper .",
    "as i will show , for most of the final states considered in this paper , there are uncertainties which are significantly larger than the effect of the one - loop electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "electroweak radiative corrections thus will be ignored in the following .",
    "the total @xmath2 cross section at @xmath4  tev is @xmath76  fb . it decreases with increasing center of mass energy and higgs boson mass .",
    "the current design luminosity of the ilc is  @xcite @xmath77 , corresponding to a yearly integrated luminosity of 200  fb@xmath8 .",
    "one therefore expects a total of about 40  @xmath18 events per year at such a machine , before @xmath37- and higgs boson decays , and experimental acceptance cuts and efficiencies , are taken into account .    with an expected @xmath52-tagging efficiency of 80% or higher , and",
    "a fairly large branching ratio ( @xmath78 ( 33% ) for @xmath13  gev ( @xmath79  gev ) ) , requiring @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath48 ) offers the best chance to identify @xmath18 events .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath81 branching ratio is very small , and too few @xmath82 events are left to make this final state viable for a measurement of the higgs boson self - coupling .",
    "i therefore concentrate on the @xmath83 final state , where @xmath84 denotes a light jet pair consistent with originating from a @xmath37-boson ( i.e. satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : mjj ] ) ) and which is not tagged as a @xmath52-pair .",
    "this explicitly removes @xmath85 decays , reducing the combinatorial background and simplifying the analysis .",
    "since additional jets tend to weaken the sensitivity limits for @xmath1  @xcite , i require exactly two light jets , and four tagged @xmath52-quarks in events .",
    "two or more pairs of @xmath52-quarks have to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbb ] ) or  ( [ eq : mbb1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the four feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath86 @xmath87 signal , there are approximately 8,500 @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 non - resonant and single higgs resonant diagrams contributing to the same final state .",
    "single - resonant higgs and the @xmath89 diagrams constitute the potentially largest background contributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the role of the non - resonant and single resonant @xmath91 and @xmath92 diagrams in @xmath93 was analyzed in the limit of a stable @xmath37-boson .",
    "it was found that the contribution of the @xmath94 diagrams was small compared with the signal for @xmath95  gev . however , the background from @xmath96 single higgs production can be substantial , in particular for @xmath97  gev",
    ". misidentification of light jets and charm quarks also contribute to the background for @xmath98 production .    using the cuts and efficiencies listed in eqs .",

    "gev at the same center of mass energy , however , taking into account the single - resonant and non - resonant electroweak and qcd diagrams almost doubles the cross section .",

    "this , together with the extremely small signal cross section , and the large renormalization uncertainty of the reducible background cross section , implies that it will be extremely difficult to measure the higgs boson self - coupling in @xmath387 production with four tagged @xmath52-quarks and @xmath79  gev at an ilc with a center of mass energy of 0.5  tev . at @xmath5  tev ,",

    "if one of the higgs bosons in @xmath18 production decays into four jets , the final state consists of @xmath144 .",
    "since the combinatorial background complicates identification of which jets originate from higgs and which from @xmath37-boson decays , i have not considered @xmath144 production here .",
    "a more straightforward approach is to increase the signal cross section by taking into account final states where only three @xmath52-quarks are tagged . requiring only three tagged @xmath52-quarks strongly increases the reducible background and this more than compensates the potential gain in sensitivity from the increased signal cross section",

    "@xcite may be promising .    for @xmath5  tev ,",
    "the @xmath151 cross section is about a factor two larger than that for @xmath98 production .",

    ", the signal cross section can be increased by including the @xmath199 final state which results when one of the higgs bosons decays via @xmath394 . combining the limits from @xmath151 and @xmath199 production",
    ", i found that the higgs boson self - coupling can be probed with @xmath395 accuracy with 2  ab@xmath8 at a 1  tev @xmath0 collider .",

    "a 3  tev collider will be able to measure the higgs boson self - coupling with a precision of @xmath7 for the higgs boson masses investigated here .    a madevent based calculation of the full set of non - resonant feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath398 , @xmath264 and @xmath181 production is currently not feasible as it requires very large computing resources .",
    "other programs , which are not based on the evaluation of feynman diagrams promise a solution for this problem in the future , however , these programs are currently not able to handle the final states of interest . in absence of a calculation which includes the full set of non - resonant feynman diagrams ,",
    "i have estimated their effect from calculations which include sub - sets of the non - resonant feynman diagrams .",
    "unavoidably , this introduces a theoretical uncertainty in the cross section which i have assumed to be of the same size as the effect from those non - resonant diagrams which were included in the calculation . if this uncertainty can be reduced in the future by a calculation which includes the full set of non - resonant feynman diagrams , the bounds which can be achieved will improve by a factor  1.6    2 .",
    "uncertainties in the calculations presented in this paper also originate from the detector performance assumed . a better resolution of the hadronic calorimeter than that assumed such as that promised by the particle flow algorithm  @xcite may make it possible to tighten the invariant mass window for @xmath52-jet and light quark / gluon jet pairs .",
    "this would reduce both reducible and irreducible backgrounds and thus improve the sensitivity to anomalous higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "the reducible backgrounds in final states involving @xmath52-quarks strongly depend on the charm and light quark / gluon jet misidentification probabilities .",
    "more powerful algorithms for tagging @xmath52-quarks may well reduce the misidentification probabilities in the future .",
    "one of the main results of the calculations presented here is that a 0.5  tev ilc will be able to determine the higgs boson self - coupling only if the higgs boson mass is rather close to the current lower bound .",

    "on the other hand , the slhc and vlhc promise better limits .",
