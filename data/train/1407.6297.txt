    "a network formalism is often very useful for describing complex systems of interacting entities  @xcite .",
    "scholars in a diverse set of disciplines have studied networks for many decades , and network science has experienced particularly explosive growth during the past 20 years  @xcite .",
    "the most traditional network representation is a static graph , in which nodes represent entities and edges represent pairwise connections between nodes .",
    "however , many networks are time - dependent @xcite or multiplex ( include multiple types of connections between nodes ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , network structure is influenced profoundly by spatial effects @xcite . to avoid discarding potentially important information , which can lead to misleading results , it is thus crucial to develop methods that incorporate features such as time - dependence , multiplexity , and spatial embeddedness in a context - dependent manner @xcite . because of the newfound wealth of rich data , it has now become possible to validate increasingly complicated network structures and methods using empirical data .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study a mesoscale network structure known as _ community structure_. a `` community '' is a set of nodes with dense connections among themselves , and with only sparse connections to other communities in a network  @xcite .",
    "communities arise in numerous applications .",
    "for example , social networks typically include dense sets of nodes with common interests or other characteristics @xcite , networks of legislators often contain dense sets of individuals who vote in similar ways @xcite , and protein - protein interaction networks include dense sets of nodes that constitute functional units @xcite .",
    "the algorithmic detection of communities and the subsequent investigation of both their aggregate properties and the properties of their component members can provide novel insights into the relationship between network structure and function ( e.g. , functional groupings of newly discovered proteins  @xcite ) .",
    "myriad community detection methods have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the most popular family of methods entails the optimization of a quality function known as _",
    "modularity _ @xcite . to optimize modularity ,",
    "one compares the actual network structure to some _ null model _ , which quantifies what it means for a pair of nodes to be connected `` at random '' .",
    "traditionally , most studies have randomized only network structure ( while preserving some structural properties ) and not incorporated other features ( such as spatial or other information ) . the standard null model for modularity",
    "optimization is the `` newman - girvan '' ( ng ) null model , in which one randomizes edge weights such that the expected strength distribution is preserved @xcite .",
    "it is thus related to the classical configuration model @xcite .",
    "it has become very popular due to its simplicity and effectiveness , and it has been derived systematically through the consideration of laplacian dynamics on networks @xcite . however , it is also a naive choice , as it does not incorporate domain - specific information .",
    "the choice of a null model is an important consideration because ( 1 ) it can have a significant effect on the community structure obtained via optimization of a quality function , and ( 2 ) it changes the interpretation of communities @xcite .",
    "the best choice for a null model depends on both one s data set and scientific question . in the present paper",
    ", we explore the issue of null model choice in detail in the context of spatially embedded and temporal networks .    most existing research on community detection",
    "does not incorporate metadata about nodes ( or edges ) or information about the timing and location of interactions between nodes .",
    "however , with the increasing wealth of space - resolved and time - resolved data sets , it is important to develop community detection techniques that take advantage of the additional spatial and temporal information ( and of domain - specific information , such as generative models for human interactions @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , community detection in temporal networks has become increasingly popular  @xcite , but the majority of methods use networks that are constructed from either static snapshots of data or aggregations of data over time windows .",
    "few investigations of community structure in temporal networks have used methods that exploit temporal structure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also starting to be more work on the influence of space on community structure  @xcite , but much more research is necessary . in the present paper ,",
    "we use modularity maximization to study communities in spatially embedded and time - dependent networks .",
    "we compare the results of community detection using two different spatial null models  a _ gravity null model _  @xcite and a new _ radiation null model _  to the standard ng null model using novel synthetic benchmark networks that incorporate spatial effects via distance decay or disease flux as well as temporal correlation networks that we constructed using time - series data of recurrent epidemic outbreaks in peru .",
    "we also evaluate a recently - proposed _ correlation null model _ , which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are constructed from time series  @xcite , on the epidemic - correlation data .",
    "our direct analysis of disease data in the present paper provides a complementary ( e.g. , more systemic ) approach to the majority of studies using network science methodology in this field , which focus on the importance of interpersonal contact networks on the disease spread on an individual level .",
    "these types of network methods have become increasingly prevalent in the modeling of infectious diseases  @xcite .",
    "our work also complements other approaches , such as large - scale compartmental models that incorporate transportation networks to link local populations .",
    "such models have been used to study large - scale spatial disease spread ( e.g. , to examine the influence of features such as spatial location , climate , and facility of transportation on phenomena such as disease persistence and synchronization of disease spread ) @xcite .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ section : networks ] , we give an overview of networks and community detection .",
    "we also discuss the gravity null model and introduce a new radiation null model .",
    "we give our results for synthetic spatial networks in section [ section : benchmarks ] , and we give our results for correlation networks that we construct from disease data in section [ section : dengue ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ section : conclusions ] . in appendices ,",
    "we include the results of additional numerical experiments from varying parameters in the benchmark networks .",
    "we also include an additional examination of the similarity between network partitions for the benchmarks and the dengue fever correlation networks .",
    "a network describes a set of entities ( called _ nodes _ ) that are connected by pairwise relationships ( called _ edges _ ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we study weighted networks which are _ spatially embedded _ : each node represents a location in space .",
    "one can represent a weighted network with @xmath0 nodes as an @xmath1 adjacency matrix @xmath2 , where an edge @xmath3 represents the strength of the relationship between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we seek to find _ communities _ , which are sets of nodes that are densely connected to each other but sparsely connected to other dense sets in a network  @xcite .",
    "we wish to study the evolution of network structure through time .",
    "the simplest way to represent temporal data is through an ordered set of _ static networks _",
    ", which can arise either as snapshots at different points in time or as a sequence of aggregations over consecutive time windows ( which one can take either as overlapping or nonoverlapping ) .",
    "static networks provide a good starting point for the development and investigation of new methods  which , in our case , entails how to incorporate spatial information into null models for community detection via modularity maximization .",
    "however , they do not take full advantage of temporal information in data that changes in time .",
    "for example , it can be hard to track the identity of communities in temporal sequences of networks @xcite . to mitigate the community - tracking problem",
    ", we also use a type of _ multilayer network _  @xcite known as a multislice network @xcite .",
    "this gives an @xmath6 adjacency tensor @xmath7 that has @xmath8 layers and @xmath0 nodes in each layer , where each layer has a copy each node @xmath4 .",
    "the intralayer edges in the network are exactly the same as they were for the sequence of static networks : the tensor element @xmath9 gives the weight of an intralayer edge between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in layer @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , each node is connected to copies of itself in consecutive layers @xmath10 and @xmath11 using interlayer edges of weight @xmath12 . in this paper , we will suppose for simplicity that @xmath13 , but one can also consider more general situations @xcite .",
    "a multislice network can have up to ( @xmath14 ) _ multilayer nodes _",
    "( i.e. , node - layer tuples ) , each of which corresponds to a specific ( node , time ) pair .",
    "hence , this structure makes it possible to detect temporally evolving communities in a natural way .    for our computations of community structure ,",
    "we flatten the @xmath6 adjacency tensor into a @xmath15 adjacency matrix , such that the intralayer connections are on the main block diagonal and the interlayer connections occur on the off - block - diagonal entries .",
    "we detect communities by maximizing modularity , which we use to describe the `` quality '' of a particular network partition into communities in terms of its departure from a null model  @xcite .",
    "the null model amounts to a prior belief regarding influences on network structure , so it is important to carefully consider the choice of null model @xcite .    for a weighted static network @xmath2 , modularity is  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total edge weight , @xmath18 denotes the community that contains node @xmath4 , the function @xmath19 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th element of the null model matrix .",
    "one can examine different scales of community structure by incorporating a resolution parameter @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "smaller values of @xmath22 tend to yield larger communities and vice versa .    for multislice networks ,",
    "modularity is given by @xmath23 \\delta ( { \\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muc\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}_{is } , { \\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5muc\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}_{jr})}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , the quantity @xmath25 denotes the community that contains node @xmath4 in layer @xmath10 , and @xmath26 is the @xmath21-th element of the null model tensor in layer @xmath10  @xcite .    to detect communities via modularity maximization ,",
    "one searches the possible network partitions for the one with the highest modularity score .",
    "because exhaustive search over all possible partitions is computationally intractable @xcite , practical algorithms invariably use approximate optimization methods ( e.g. , greedy algorithms , simulated annealing , or spectral optimization ) , and different approaches offer different balances between speed and accuracy  @xcite .    in the present paper , we optimize modularity using a two - phase iterative procedure similar to the louvain method  @xcite . however , rather than using the adjacency matrix @xmath2 , we work with the modularity matrix @xmath27 with elements @xmath28 for static networks and with the modularity tensor with elements @xmath29 for multislice networks  @xcite .    the employed louvain - like algorithm  @xcite is stochastic , and a modularity landscape for empirical networks typically includes a very large number of nearly - optimal partitions  @xcite .",
    "for each of our numerical experiments , we thus apply the computational heuristic 100 times to obtain a _ consensus community structure _  @xcite by constructing an _ association matrix _ @xmath30 ( where the entries @xmath31 represent the fraction of times that nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are classified together in the 100 partitions ) and performing community detection on @xmath30 using the uniform null model @xmath32 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "we choose the uniform null model in order to detect the strongest community structure in the association matrix ( i.e. , one that is often detected by the original optimization process ) .    for multislice networks , we perform community detection and then consensus clustering using the same basic procedure .",
    "this yields an assignment of each multilayer node ( i.e. , node - layer tuple ) to a community .",
    "we are also sometimes interested in community assignments of the original entities ( i.e. , a partition of the set of nodes regardless of what layer they are in ) .",
    "for example , we might wish to compare the result of algorithmic community detection to known partitions , such as grouping a node ( i.e. , province ) by climate , population , administrative region , etc . to do this",
    ", we perform what we call _ province - level community detection _ , which proceeds in two rounds : ( 1 ) we detect communities in a multislice network using any method and null model of choice ; ( 2 ) we use this partition to construct an @xmath1 province - level association matrix ( i.e. , a matrix @xmath33 where entries @xmath34 represent the fraction of times that nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are classified together in all layers ) , and we detect province - level communities by maximizing modularity on this association matrix using a uniform null model .",
    "we choose the uniform null model to detect the most temporally persistent community structure in the association matrix ( i.e. , one that is often detected in multiple layers ) .",
    "we can then follow this with consensus community detection across 100 repeat province - level structures .",
    "the choice of null model is vital for the detection of communities using modularity maximization  @xcite .",
    "the most common choice is the newman - girvan ( ng ) null model , which randomizes a network such that the expected strength sequence of nodes is preserved  @xcite .",
    "for static , weighted networks , the ng null model is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the strength ( i.e. , weighted degree ) of node @xmath4 and @xmath17 is the total edge weight in the network .",
    "for multislice networks , the ng null model is  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the intralayer strength of node @xmath4 in layer @xmath10 and @xmath24 .    despite its popularity and demonstrated effectiveness in many situations , the ng null model is naive in the sense that only takes node strengths into account and it does not incorporate problem - specific information ( such as spatial embeddedness ) .",
    "it is often important to incorporate additional ( domain - specific or even problem - specific ) information , and what one considers to be connected `` at random '' depends fundamentally on the research question of interest .",
    "consequently , ng null model is not suitable for all applications .      in many spatially embedded networks",
    ", proximity has a strong effect on the connections between nodes , as ( all else held equal ) neighboring nodes are more likely to be connected to each other ( and their connections are likely to have to have larger weights ) than nodes that are far away @xcite .",
    "moreover , proximity can mask other underlying influences .",
    "consequently , incorporating the expected influence of proximity on edge weights into null models for community detection should make it possible to discover new and important types of structures .",
    "expert et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a spatial null model that was inspired by the `` gravity model '' of human mobility @xcite .",
    "a gravity model assumes that the interaction between two locations is proportional to their importance ( e.g. , population ) , but it decays with distance .    in the standard gravity model , the interaction between locations @xmath4 and @xmath5 with respective populations @xmath39 and @xmath40 that are a distance @xmath41 apart is @xmath42 where the `` deterrence function '' @xmath43 describes the effect of space on node interactions .",
    "common choices for the deterrence function include inverse proportionality to distance ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , inverse proportionality to squared distance ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) , exponential decay ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , and other interactions of the form @xmath47",
    "it is common to estimate the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 using regression .",
    "gravity models have been employed successfully during the past half century to model spatial interactions such as population migration  @xcite , trade  @xcite , and disease spread  @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of a gravity - like interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravitymodel ] ) , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , was incorporated into a _ gravity null model _",
    "@xcite , to give @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the importance of node @xmath4 .",
    "one estimates the `` deterrence function '' @xmath55 from data for all nodes at distance @xmath56 between them in a data set .",
    "expert et al .",
    "@xcite used @xmath39 , the population of province @xmath4 , as their measure of node importance .",
    "after briefly experimenting with variations , such as using population density or a logarithm of the population ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) and observing no significant differences in performance , we will follow their lead .",
    "another simple choice is node strength ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , though the null model then becomes very similar to the usual ng null model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath43 does not depend on distance , then the null model becomes exactly the ng null model in that case .    in most data sets , distances are continuous",
    ", so one needs to bin distance data to obtain enough nodes in each distance bin to construct a meaningful deterrence function @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravityfd ] ) .",
    "possible binning methods include binning into equal - distance bins ( e.g. , every @xmath59 km ) and equal - sized bins ( e.g. , each bin containing @xmath60 elements ) .",
    "after testing the choice of binning procedure on the benchmark networks and applying the null model to empirical data and observing no qualitative differences in null model performance , we selected the equal - distance method for the rest of the paper , while choosing a bin size large enough that there are always more than 5 elements in each bin . additionally , for the benchmark networks we can test the influence of bin sizes on similarity of algorithmic partitions to the planted community structure",
    ". we will give the specific bin sizes for spatial benchmark and dengue correlation networks in their respective sections .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gravity ] ) and ( [ eq : gravityfd ] ) allows us to write the gravity null model as @xmath61 expert et al .",
    "used the null model ( [ eq : gravitynm ] ) to uncover a linguistic partition of a network of belgian mobile phone calls into the french and flemish speaking parts of belgium .",
    "this partition was obscured by geographical communities when using the ng null model  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we generalize the gravity null model to a multislice setting by calculating a separate gravity null model for each layer @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting multislice gravity null model is @xmath62 where we have assumed that the population stays constant across time .",
    "if one has reliable information about changes in population with time , one can incorporate such information into the null model ( [ eq : gravitym ] ) by substituting @xmath54 with an analogous quantity @xmath63 that depends both on the node @xmath4 and on the layer @xmath10 .",
    "gravity models include multiple parameters that one needs to either choose arbitrarily or estimate from data .",
    "moreover , by their design , gravity models are unable to predict different fluxes between locations that are the same distance apart but which have regions with different population densities between them . for example , one would expect a higher flux of infectious disease between two locations that are separated by a space with high population density than between locations that are separated by a space with low population density ( because of the higher availability of susceptible hosts in the latter case )  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , one would expect a smaller commuting flux between such locations in the latter case due to higher availability of nearby jobs , as this reduces peoples willingness to commute for longer distances  @xcite .",
    "the radiation model  @xcite was developed to attempt to address these issues .",
    "it was designed for population flows and has subsequently been applied successfully in several situations  @xcite . because the radiation model is designed to capture human mobility between populations , and the long - distance spread of many infectious diseases  including dengue  is believed to be largely due to long - distance mobility  @xcite , the radiation model might provide a useful but simplified description for the spread of disease across space . in this section ,",
    "we use it to construct a new spatial null model for community detection that we believe might be well - suited for studying the long - distance spread of dengue .    the mean commuting flux predicted by the radiation model for locations @xmath4 and @xmath5 with populations @xmath39 and @xmath40 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the population between locations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath66 is the number of commuters in location @xmath4 . a simple way to calculate @xmath65 is to use the population @xmath67 in the circle of radius @xmath41 centered at @xmath4 and subtract the total of the populations at the origin and destination .",
    "that is , @xmath68 .",
    "although the radiation model is relatively recent  @xcite , several modifications to it have already been proposed .",
    "these include incorporating a normalization for finite systems  @xcite and the development of a general framework that includes ideas from the radiation , gravity , and intervening - opportunities models  @xcite .",
    "we propose a novel null model for community detection based on the original formulation of the radiation model  @xcite .",
    "we use a similar formulation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gravitynm ] ) to incorporate both the expected distance - dependent flux and the actual network structure . to avoid creating a directed network",
    ", we use a symmetrized predicted flux @xmath69 between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 . we thereby construct the _ radiation null model _ @xmath70    in section [ section : dengue ] , we will study community structure in empirical data from several years of dengue fever occurrences in peru . because we do not possess detailed data on the commuting patterns in peru ( see the description of our data in section  [ data ] ) , we assume that commuters are distributed uniformly across space",
    ". we can then simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : radiation ] ) by substituting @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the fraction of the population that commutes . because the quantity @xmath72 is present in both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : radiation - null ] ) , we can now cancel it out . however ,",
    "if one possesses commuting data , it would be desirable to use it to improve the radiation null model .",
    "we also extend the radiation null model to a multislice setting in an analogous manner to the gravity null model .",
    "the multislice radiation null model is @xmath73 again , one can incorporate temporal data about population sizes and thereby replace @xmath74 with @xmath75 to improve the null model .",
    "the incorporation of spatial information into null models for community detection is an important problem , and several other ideas have been proposed recently .",
    "for example , cerina et al .  @xcite focused on disentangling the correlation between node attributes and space , so they used a simple exponential decay : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean distance between nodes in a network .",
    "shakarian et al .",
    "@xcite focused on finding geographically - disperse communities , so they introduced a decay constant @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "another recently - proposed null model was used to attempt to find geographically - proximate communities @xcite .",
    "as the exact nature of the influence of spatial distance on interactions in the dengue fever data is unclear , we decided to focus only on null models that include a contribution from the data , rather than using null models with an arbitrarily chosen functional dependence .",
    "thus , we do not test these null models in the present paper .",
    "to test the performance of the spatial null models , we develop novel synthetic benchmark networks that represent idealized spatially - embedded networks with planted community structure .    in what we call the _ distance benchmark _ , the probability of an edge between two nodes depends only on the geographical distance between nodes and on their community assignments .",
    "we assign @xmath0 nodes uniformly at random to positions on the lattice @xmath80 .",
    "we assign a population @xmath39 to each node @xmath4 ( which is an idealized `` city '' ) .",
    "we create two versions of the distance benchmark : the `` uniform population distance benchmark '' and the `` random population distance benchmark '' .",
    "the uniform population version corresponds to the benchmark in expert et al .",
    "@xcite ; we assign the same population ( @xmath81 ) to each node . in the random population benchmark",

    "we place @xmath0 nodes uniformly at random on the lattice @xmath80 , and we assign populations and communities in the same manner as for the distance benchmark . again as with the distance benchmark , we consider both uniform - population and random - population versions of the flux benchmark . now , however , the edge probability @xmath95 is directly proportional to the mean predicted radiation - model flux between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath96 , which is turn is inversely proportional to distance @xmath41 ) : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a normalization constant to ensure that @xmath99 .    in table [ table - benchmarks ] , we summarize the four synthetic benchmark networks that we have just introduced .",

    "when we constructed multilayer networks and computed consensus communities , the computed `` spatial '' multilayer partitions and province - level partitions highlight the importance of climate to the disease patterns of dengue , as the jungle provinces are placed into distinct communities from most mountainous and coastal provinces .",

    "moreover , the variability in disease patterns between jungle provinces is high , perhaps due to the year - round disease presence ( in contrast to the existence of a summer disease season on the coast ) .",
    "chowell et al .",
    "@xcite reported that the coastal and mountainous provinces exhibit more spatial heterogeneity of disease incidence than the jungle provinces , and population size appears to play a larger role in disease persistence in the jungle . additionally , the jungle climate is more homogenous ( especially in the north - south direction ) than the other two climates .",
    "when we attempt to remove the influence of space by using the gravity and radiation null models , we obtain one large community that contains all but the highest - population provinces ( which are assigned to singleton communities ) .",
    "in contrast to the linguistic example in ref .",
    "@xcite , this suggests for our disease networks that the incorporation of space into the null model accounts for the majority of the structure present in the network .",
    "the spatial structure that we removed likely includes the structure that corresponds to the climate variation that causes different epidemic patterns in the jungle , coastal , and mountainous provinces .",
    "the only variable that we were able to identify as influencing community structure when using spatial null models is province population : the highly populated ( and typically coastal ) provinces forming singleton communities .",
    "these highly populated provinces are likely to be economic centers , with many people traveling there from the other provinces and thereby transmitting the disease  @xcite .",
    "these provinces could then be the seeds of epidemics for the other coastal and mountainous provinces , and two studies have in fact reported ( so - called ) `` hierarchical '' transmission of dengue from populous regions to those with low populations in both peru and thailand  @xcite .",
    "this situation could lead to high correlations across atypically long distances compared with the majority of the data , which could in turn cause populous provinces to be assigned to singleton communities .",
    "additionally , it is known that population size influences dengue transmission : the basic reproductive number @xmath253 and disease persistence ( i.e. , the fraction of weeks with disease cases ) are positively correlated with population size , and the attack rates are negatively correlated with it  @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of spatial information into null models for community detection is both interesting and desirable . as we have illustrated in the present paper , however , there are many nuances that it is important to consider .",
    "we have also demonstrated that it is important to develop null models that incorporate generative mechanisms for human mobility and flux .",
    "we similarly expect that domain - dependent , mechanistic null models will also be crucial in many other applications .",

    "<S> in the study of networks , it is often insightful to use algorithms to determine mesoscale features such as `` community structure '' , in which densely connected sets of nodes constitute `` communities '' that have sparse connections to other communities . the most popular way of detecting communities algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity . when optimizing modularity , one compares the actual connections in a ( static or time - dependent ) network to the connections obtained from a random - graph ensemble that acts as a null model . </S>",
    "<S> the communities are then the sets of nodes that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the null model . clearly , the process of community detection depends fundamentally on the choice of null model , so it is important to develop and analyze novel null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under study . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the effects of using null models that incorporate spatial information , and we propose a novel null model based on the radiation model of population spread . we also develop novel synthetic spatial benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on distance or flux between nodes , and we compare the performance of both static and time - dependent radiation null model to the standard ( `` newman - girvan '' ) null model for modularity optimization and a recently - proposed gravity null model . in our comparisons , we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and time - dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue fever incidence data for peru . </S>",
