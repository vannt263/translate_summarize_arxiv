    "the search for candidates for dark energy has been a stimulus to recent thermodynamics of exotic systems which had not attracted the interest of researchers before the discovery of cosmic acceleration and the need for systems with sufficiently negative pressure @xcite@xcite .",
    "dark energy is believed to contain seventy per cent of the energy of the whole universe , and to make the cosmic expansion to accelerate .",
    "the latter fact requires that @xmath20 , @xmath6 being the internal energy density and @xmath5 the pressure .",
    "thus , much interest has been focused on systems such that @xmath21 , with @xmath2 a numerical constant , as simplest possibilities for dark energy . for the sake of generality we do not restrict to @xmath22 , but we consider the situations with @xmath23 under a single physical formalism , in order to extend all the arguments to different physical objects .",
    "in particular , the cases with @xmath24 and @xmath11 correspond to a gas of photons and to a gas of linear string loops and exhibit an interesting duality relation between themselves @xcite",
    ".    other physical objects could be small cosmic membranes of size @xmath1 , with energy proportional to the area , i.e. to @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath25 , as we will see below . in the present paper",
    "we do not aim to propose a particular microscopic model for dark energy , but to deepen into the applications of thermodynamics for a family of objects leading to an equation of state of the form @xmath21 , in particular , in the application of thermodynamic ideas to obtain information on the spectral energy distribution of such known or hypothetical objects .    from the spectral distribution",
    "one may obtain a generalized wien s law relating temperature @xmath26 and the most probable size characterizing the mentioned objects , which for photons reduces to the well - known form of wien s law for electromagnetic radiation , but which for cosmic string loops leads to a significantly different result . such generalized law would provide a simple link between the geometrical features of those objects and the temperature of the corresponding system .",
    "in section 2 we summarize some previous thermodynamic results , in section 3 we present the adiabatic theorem and its general relation with the spectral distribution , and in section 4 we apply them to our family of systems .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions and comments ; in particular , we stress relevant differences between the systems with @xmath27 and with @xmath28 .",
    "in @xcite , we have proposed to consider a family of hypothetical physical entities that are characterized by a length @xmath1 and an energy @xmath29 , given by @xmath30 as photons , for @xmath8 ( with @xmath1 the wavelength and @xmath31 ) , cosmic strings with @xmath11 ( @xmath32 , with @xmath1 the length ) , cosmic dust , with @xmath33 ( no characteristic length , usually taken as dots ) , or cosmic membranes , with energy proportional to their area , with @xmath1 the lateral size and @xmath13 , or cosmic quintessence , corresponding to @xmath34 .    in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) @xmath10 is a numerical constant which may depend on the model of loop , and whose value is yet uncertain , in the range between 1 and 10@xmath35 , according to current results based on the observations of the energy peaks of astronomical flares from gamma ray bursts and from active galactic nuclei @xcite@xcite .    under two further physical hypotheses , namely : a ) that their absolute temperature @xmath26 may be related to the average value of the internal energy as @xmath36 ( @xmath37 denoting the average value over the length distribution function of the objects ) and b ) that the average separation between these entities is proportional to their average size , these systems lead in a direct way to @xmath38 , and to a vanishing chemical potential @xcite .",
    "note that here we are dealing with special kind of cosmic string loops with formal features analogous to quantized vortices in superfluids @xcite . according to b ) , in an expansion at constant energy , these loops aggregate to form longer and more separated loops , which leads to a decrease of entropy .",
    "thus , @xmath39 is negative , and this yields a negative pressure .",
    "this have not been so had we considered loops whose length was not modified in the expansion , but which would have kept constant length and become more separated .",
    "a dilute gas with these latter kind of loops would have the same equation as a system of points , instead of yielding a negative pressure .",
    "thus , both features a ) and b ) are relevant for the definition of the systems considered here , which may be considered as mathematical models , independently of their actual physical existence .    in @xcite",
    "we have focused our attention on the explicit determination of the thermodynamic functions of these systems , as for instance @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and so on , being @xmath45 and @xmath46 internal energy , entropy , helmholtz free energy , temperature and volume , respectively . in particular , it was shown that @xmath47 with @xmath48 a constant , and the entropy @xmath49 with @xmath50 another constant .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite we have considered in detail the duality relations between electromagnetic radiation ( @xmath8 ) and cosmic string loops ( @xmath11 ) , while in @xcite it was extended to systems with @xmath51 . in the present paper",
    "we go a step beyond and explore in more depth the thermodynamic clues on the spectral energy distribution , i.e @xmath52 , describing the energy density distribution among the several modes of frequency @xmath53 at a given temperature @xmath26 . this is more than an academic exercise , as this information is essential for a deeper physical understanding of these systems , for a comparison with other kinds of systems , and as a step towards a statistical physics formulation for them .",
    "in this presentation we follow the lines by lima and alcaniz @xcite in their analysis of the same problem we are interested in , namely , to explore the spectral energy distribution of systems with @xmath21 using thermodynamic methods",
    ". however , our approach is very different , since we have concrete ( although hypothetical ) models for our systems , which will let us to have information on the dispersion relation between frequency and characteristic lengths . as a consequence , our conclusions about the form of wien s law in terms of temperature and wavelength for different values of @xmath2 will be very different from those obtained in @xcite , although its expression in terms of temperature and frequency will be the same of them .    here , instead of the internal energy @xmath54 of the system in a volume @xmath46 at temperature @xmath26 , we want to find thermodynamic constraints on the spectral distribution @xmath55 or the spectral energy density @xmath56 , in such a way we may write : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the total energy contained in a small band of frequency @xmath59 ( between @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and @xmath52 the energy density per unit volume .",
    "our main concern will be to find the form of @xmath62 .",
    "we start our analysis by using the adiabatic theorem proved by ehrenfest in 1917 @xcite , which states that for any reversible adiabatic change of volume inside an enclosure at temperature @xmath26 at thermodynamic equilibrium , the internal energy in any frequency slot of width @xmath63 centered in frequency @xmath53 , divided by frequency @xmath53 is constant , i.e. : @xmath64 here , it means that we consider an enclosure containing the system defined by ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) at temperature @xmath65 and focus our attention on a band of frequencies @xmath66 centered on frequency @xmath67 .",
    "assume that temperature @xmath65 changes to temperature @xmath68 in an adiabatic ( and reversible ) volume change from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "the frequency band being considered will change from @xmath67 and @xmath71 to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the corresponding energy contained in these bands will be @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "thus , according to ( [ 7bis ] ) and taking into account ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) and that entropy is constant in an adiabatic and reversible process then one has @xmath76 on the other side , according to ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) , the energy density should change as @xmath77 where summation refers to the slots @xmath63 in which the frequency domain can be divided because of ( [ equa1 ] ) .",
    "expression ( [ equa2bis ] ) can be also written using ( [ 7bis ] ) and ( [ equa1 ] ) as @xmath78 which , because of the arbitrary choice of the ensemble @xmath67 and @xmath72 and their corresponding slots @xmath66 and @xmath79 , implies @xmath80    from here follows also that @xmath81 .",
    "thus , one has from ( [ equa1 ] ) @xmath82 multiplying and dividing the expression of @xmath62 by @xmath83 an taking into account ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) , one may write @xmath62 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a function to be determined , but which does not change in adiabatic processes because its argument , @xmath86 , remains constant in such change , according to ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) ( all the frequency of the mode change as @xmath26 in the adiabatic process ) .",
    "this may be considered as the generalized wien spectrum , because for electromagnetic radiation it was wien who proposed this kind of functional form .",
    "he himself proposed an approximate expression of exponential form for @xmath87 , whose exact form for electromagnetic radiation ( @xmath88 ) was finally obtained by planck in 1900 , namely @xmath89 with @xmath90 boltzmann s constant .",
    "+    in the next section we turn our attention to the family of systems defined by ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) , which generalizes the thermodynamics of electromagnetic radiation to a wider family of systems .",
    "to apply the ideas of the former section to our family of systems ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) we need information on their characteristic frequency . in the case of electromagnetic radiation",
    ", this is clear , because @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the wave - length and @xmath93 the speed of light in vacuum . to do this in a more general way for all the systems in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) we consider ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) as expressions for the energy quanta in terms of @xmath1 ( recall that for photons ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) yields @xmath94 , with @xmath1 the wavelength ) .",
    "furthermore , we combine this expression for the quanta of energy in terms of @xmath1 with the einstein - planck expression of the energy of the quanta in terms of @xmath53 , namely @xmath95 .",
    "then , combining ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) with this expression we obtain @xmath96 for photons this just yields @xmath97 ( @xmath1 being @xmath92 ) . for string loops",
    "this yields @xmath98 which gives the characteristic frequency of a loop of length @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the general form of energy spectral distribution for these systems will be of the kind ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) . in principle",
    ", the form of @xmath99 depends on @xmath2 .",
    "it is tempting to assume that for all of them an analogous of the planck distribution holds , in such a way that @xmath100    but this is only a guess which turns out to be untenable for @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , it is known @xcite@xcite that for @xmath101 the systems are thermodynamically stable , but that for @xmath102 they have negative specific heat and therefore they are unstable , and require a continuous input to keep themselves into existence ( in cosmology , this input could be the cosmic expansion itself ) .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the form of @xmath99 may be considerably different for @xmath101 and for @xmath102 .",
    "the situation @xmath33 , corresponding to cosmic dust , implies constant energy , independent on the length .",
    "usually , it is taken @xmath103 as its characteristic length , namely , point - like dust ; and the characteristic temperature @xmath26 is taken as zero , in order that @xmath104 may be finite .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of strings and string loops has been studied in different systems , going from cosmic strings @xcite@xcite to quantized vortex loops in superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that one should expect a potential distribution law .",
    "for instance , the length probability distribution in these systems is often found to have the form @xcite @xmath105 with @xmath106 the number of loops of length comprised between @xmath1 and @xmath107 per unit volume ; @xmath108 is a dimensionless normalization constant , @xmath109 a characteristic exponent , and @xmath110 the minimum length ( otherwise , for a vanishing minimum length , the distribution function would be divergent ) .",
    "but here we aim to relate ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) to the spectral energy distributions ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) .",
    "to do so , we need to express the energy distribution , to relate @xmath1 to the frequency @xmath53 , and to introduce temperature @xmath26 , which is not evident , because ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) differs very much from the usual forms of equilibrium statistical distribution functions , for which the temperature is well identified . in ref @xcite,@xcite",
    "we have used for temperature the definition @xmath111 with @xmath37 standing for the average value of the energy over the distribution of lengths of the objects . in ref @xcite",
    "we showed that using distribution ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) one obtains @xmath112    the energy density distribution in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath1 will be @xmath113 we may convert it to @xmath114 taking into account the relation ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) between @xmath1 and @xmath53 . since @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 where we have taken into account that @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( [ 3 - 6 ] ) for @xmath118 becomes @xmath119 note that this can be used only for @xmath120 , otherwise the distribution function would correspond to negative values of the probability .    introducing ( [ 3 - 8 ] ) into ( [ 3 - 6 ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath121 with @xmath122 and where @xmath123 is @xmath124 then , although the distribution ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) does not seem to have any relation with the energy spectral distribution ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) , we have seen here that relating @xmath1 to energy , energy to frequency , and introducing a suitable definition for temperature one may obtain for the systems with @xmath102 an energy spectral distribution function which has indeed the form required by thermodynamic arguments . though this could seem natural , this is not so , because a thermodynamic formalism for systems with @xmath102 is scarcely known ; thus , our result provides an additional argument in favor of the internal consistency of the thermodynamic analysis of systems ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .    ) for @xmath118 is plotted , assuming @xmath125 and @xmath126 . for a direct comparison with respect to the figure [ planck ] , curves are shown at the same three different temperatures(@xmath127 k , @xmath128 k and @xmath129 k ) .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +",
    "it has been recalled that the adiabatic theorem shows that @xmath130 in adiabatic reversible processes . from here",
    "follows , for instance , that the spectral distribution of @xmath53 should have the general form ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) , and from here it follows , too , that @xmath131 . in the case of photons",
    "( @xmath132 ) , it follows from here the well - known wien s law , with @xmath133 @xcite .    here",
    "we will comment about the generalization of wien s law to the case of cosmic string loops , or for cosmic membranes . having this generalization may be of interest to relate the temperature of these objects to their microscopic geometrical features .    from @xmath134",
    ", one can not conclude in general that @xmath135 , as it has been done in ref.@xcite , because this is a result for photons ( or for systems with @xmath136 proportional to @xmath137 ) . in view of ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) , instead , it is seen that @xmath138 leads to @xmath139 where @xmath16 is the most probable value of the length @xmath1 .    for electromagnetic radiation ( @xmath140 )",
    "this yields indeed @xmath141",
    ". however , for cosmic string loops ( @xmath142 ) the corresponding form is @xmath143 , for cosmic membranes ( @xmath144 ) ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) yields @xmath145 , and for dark energy ( @xmath34 ) one has @xmath146 .",
    "thus , having some detailed information on the dispersion relation of the systems with @xmath2 different from @xmath147 is essential to go from the general form @xmath138 to the several particular forms summarized in @xmath148 in terms of the characteristic length . since in ref",
    "@xcite this information was lacking , it was assumed that the form @xmath149 was valid for systems with all values of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact the behavior ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) is consistent with expansion ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) for the entropy . in an expansion , electromagnetic radiation ,",
    "cools as @xmath150 ( @xmath151 being the length scale factor of the container ) , whereas the system of cosmic string loops becomes hotter , as @xmath152 .",
    "second , it is worth to remark that systems with @xmath102 do not seem to follow planck statistics ( nor bose - einstein nor fermi - dirac ones ) .",
    "this may be related to the fact that they are not stable equilibrium systems , but steady states kept by an external input , which makes them to depend strongly on the particular dynamics , which is reflected in ( [ 3 - 10 ] ) through the value of the exponent @xmath109 .",
    "this makes even more surprising the fact that even for these systems the energy spectral distribution may be written in the general form ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) .",
    "one topic of discussion in connection with systems with negative pressure is about the possibility or impossibility of the so - called phantom dark - energy . in the present family of models , phantom dark energy with @xmath153",
    "would lead to a negative entropy .",
    "equation ( [ 3 - 8 ] ) gives some more requirements related to the distribution function ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) , according to which , to have @xmath154 , one should have that the absolute value of @xmath155 should be less than @xmath156 , @xmath109 being the exponent in ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) . the situation with @xmath34 would then require that @xmath157 , but not much is known about the actual value of @xmath109 .",
    "let us mention that in superfluid turbulence , the exponent @xmath109 describing the length probability distribution of quantized vortices is @xmath158 ; in the hypothetical case that @xmath109 had also this value ( this is only meant for the sake of a concrete illustration ) , the values of @xmath2 consistent with @xmath154 would be @xmath159 .",
    "thus , for the family of systems studied here , the admissible values of @xmath2 are related to their spectral properties ( as for instance ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) or ( [ 3 - 10 ] ) ) in a restrictive way .",
