    "we gather at an auspicious time for particle physics in general , and heavy flavor physics in particular .",
    "the highly successful lep program has concluded , making way for the lhc .",
    "run ii at the tevatron is underway .",
    "efforts to complete the @xmath1-factories and harvest their results have nearly come to fruition : kek - b and pep - ii have achieved luminosity exceeding expectations , and belle and babar both presented initial results last summer .",
    "it is widely anticipated that , in the coming weeks , direct and definitive measurements of non - zero cp violation in the @xmath2meson system will be announced by one or both @xmath2factory collaborations .",
    "such a development would undoubtedly intensify the spotlight on the heavy quark sector of the standard model .",
    "just two days prior to the opening of this conference , the cesr / cleo @xmath2physics program concluded two decades of data - taking , marking a shift of their focus from @xmath1 s to @xmath3 s , @xmath4 s , and @xmath5 s .",
    "this shift is embodied in the imminent cesr - c / cleo - c project , which will have unique capabilities to pursue precision charm measurements and qcd tests that are essential to our understanding of the the heavy flavor sector .",
    "activity and broad interest in the weak decays of heavy quarks and related issues has never been higher .",
    "the landscape is changing rapidly .",
    "this review provides a snapshot of that landscape as of early summer 2001 .",
    "in the standard model , the charged current weak interactions of three generations of quarks are governed by a lagrangian which contains a transformation from the mass eigenbasis to the flavor ( generation ) eigenbasis.@xcite this flavor - mixing is expressed as a 3@xmath73 complex matrix @xmath8 known as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix.@xcite the elements @xmath9 determine the relative weak couplings of the charge @xmath10 quarks @xmath11 , one row each , to the charge @xmath12 quarks ( @xmath13 ) , one column each . by definition ,",
    "the matrix @xmath8 is * unitary*. unitarity reduces the number of independent parameters to nine , which can be chosen as three real mixing angles and six imaginary phases .",
    "five of the phases are removable .",
    "the four remaining parameters are fundamental constants of nature to be determined by experiment ; the standard model itself gives no guidance as to their values .",
    "the successive application of charge conjugation ( @xmath14 ) , parity reversal ( @xmath15 ) , and time reversal ( @xmath16 ) is an exact symmetry of any local lagrangian field theory .",
    "the electromagnetic and strong interactions preserve all three symmetries separately ; weak interactions violate @xmath14 and @xmath15 separately but together appear to preserve @xmath6 with the exception of neutral kaon ( and perhaps beauty ) decays . within the standard model framework ,",
    "@xmath6 violation can occur only if the one irremovable ckm phase is non - zero .",
    "@xmath6 violation would not happen , however , if any two same - charge quarks have equal masses , if any mixing angle is @xmath17 or @xmath18 , or if the sine of the phase is zero .",
    "it is instructive to note a couple of special cases : first , if applied to the leptonic sector , in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses , the mixing matrix is trivially the identity ( i.e. no mixing and no @xmath6-violation ) ; second , the unitarity constraint in the case of just two quark generations leaves no irremovable phase and hence no @xmath6 violation .",
    "the latter property of @xmath8 and the existence of @xmath6 violation in neutral kaon decay provoked the hypothesis of a third generation@xcite before its experimental discovery .",
    "with such a history , it is not surprising that experimental unitarity tests continue to be pursued vigorously .",
    "the unitarity constraint imposes unity normalization on all rows and columns as well as their orthogonality .",
    "the orthogonality relations can be described geometrically by six `` unitarity triangles '' in the complex plane : each side of the @xmath19 triangle is a vector @xmath20 .",
    "all six triangles have the same area , which is non - zero only if @xmath6 violation occurs .    with the @xmath211% knowledge from experiment of @xmath22 , it can be shown that four of the unitarity triangles ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) have one side that is smaller by two or more powers of @xmath27 than the other two sides .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 triangles have three comparable sides of length @xmath30 . the @xmath28 triangle , also known as _ the _ unitarity triangle ( ut ) , is described by @xmath31 by convention , @xmath32 is used to normalize the other ut sides , forming the _ rescaled _ ut shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut ] . of the six triangles , the one described by eq .",
    "[ eq : ut ] has attracted the most attention due to the relative accessibility of sides and angles to experiment .",
    "several measurements can be used in combination to directly test unitarity , and hence the validity of the standard model itself .",
    "one favored explicitly unitary parameterization of @xmath8 has three mixing angles and a phase.@xcite generational symmetry and therefore ease of interpretation are preserved in this representation .",
    "however , currently prevalent is the wolfenstein@xcite formulation as modified by buras@xcite @xmath33 in which @xmath34 has become an expansion parameter , and terms of order @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and higher are dropped .",
    "the buras corrections , addition of the terms of higher order than @xmath37 and the rescaling of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath40 to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , attain better precision and exact unitarity .",
    "the four fundamental couplings are then @xmath27 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . here",
    "the rescaled ut has vertices in the complex plane at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ut ] .",
    "the attraction of this representation is that the hierarchy of matrix element sizes in powers of @xmath27 is explicit , as is the presence of the ut coordinates @xmath48 as separate fundamental constants .",
    "the internal angles @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , respectively ) can be taken as an alternative basis for ckm parameters.@xcite    @xmath6 violation occurs only if @xmath45 ( and therefore @xmath49 ) are non - zero . within the standard model framework ,",
    "measurement of @xmath6-conserving decays can determine the lengths of the ut sides , and therefore _ indirectly _ the value of a non - zero @xmath6-violating @xmath49 .",
    "however , the three individual angles and their sum must all be subjected to measurement for consistency with unitarity to test the limitations of the standard model itself .",
    "eventually , all the unitarity triangles need to be probed for consistency among sides and angles ; some will be easier and/or cleaner than others .",
    "global fitting can improve the metrological accuracy of all the ckm couplings .",
    "[ fig : ckmhypo ] shows the contours that would result from hypothetical precision measurements of nine observables , the values of which were chosen to be consistent with unitarity and therefore all intersect at a point .",
    "the reality now is that only a few of those quantities have been determined at all , and , for the most part , not very precisely .",
    "because hadrons , not quarks , are produced and observed in the laboratory , ckm matrix elements generally can not be extracted from experiment without understanding the effects of strong interactions on the initial and/or final state particles .",
    "the required computational alacrity must come from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the gauge theory of quarks and gluons .",
    "although modeled after qed , qcd differs in the non - linearity of its field equations ( because gluons carry color charge ) , and the permanent confinement of quarks inside hadrons ( due to strong coupling ) .",
    "asymptotic freedom has allowed the development of perturbative qcd , which has been very successful in describing high momentum - transfer ( qed - like ) processes such as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and high energy quark and gluon jets . however , untangling ckm matrix elements from the weak interactions of hadrons frequently requires theoretical understanding of the low energy , non - perturbative regime .",
    "such understanding can be described presently as incomplete at best .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , the operator product expansion ( ope ) , and several models all currently enjoy varying degrees of success in calculating effects of strong interactions .",
    "hqet predictions are rigorously accurate in the limit of infinitely heavy quark masses , and hence must be corrected in powers of @xmath55 .",
    "models are generally tuned to reproduce one set of observations and then applied to predict others .",
    "lqcd , however , is a complete definition of the theory .",
    "although unproductive for most of its existence , lqcd has recently overcome technical problems@xcite and adopted new algorithms@xcite which , along with availability of inexpensive computing power , offer the hope of @xmath211% precision on dozens of quantities within the next five years .",
    "already some form factors , decay constants , and glueball masses have lqcd predictions estimated to be accurate at the 10 - 15% level .",
    "quantities needed from non - perturbative qcd include decay constants , form - factors , and bag parameters",
    ". the decay constant appears in the leptonic decay of a meson @xmath56 as @xmath57",
    ". unfortunately such branching ratios of @xmath3 s and @xmath1 s are small enough to make purely leptonic decays not useful at present . form - factors @xmath58 play an analogous role in the @xmath59-dependence of semi - leptonic decays @xmath60 and are specific to the hadronic final state @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath59 dependence is helpful independently from the overall normalization because the form - factor value at zero recoil ( @xmath59=0 ) is accessible to hqet ; one can extrapolate the measured @xmath62 to @xmath63 to extract @xmath64 .",
    "the bag parameter appears with the decay constant squared in @xmath65 , the expression for the frequency ( neutral meson mass difference ) of @xmath66 oscillations ( i.e. @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 mixing ) , which are dominated for @xmath1 s by box diagrams with @xmath70 and @xmath71 sides .",
    "inclusive measurements of semi - leptonic decays of charm and bottom are employed to avoid the need for form - factors , relying on hqet for the necessary quark - level input .",
    "these results rest upon the assumption of _ quark - hadron duality _ , which presumes that integrated over a broad enough spectrum of hadronic final states and phase space , the measured quantity is the same as the quark - level prediction .",
    "some take this duality as a given , especially for unrestrictive event selections ; some express reservations and wonder how to assess uncertainties when experimental cuts are quite narrow , and some take inclusive results as measurements not of ckm parameters but of the validity of the duality assumption itself . in any case , inclusive measurements can be instructive as to the underlying physics and assumptions .",
    "what do we know about the ckm elements now , without unitarity constraints ?",
    "of the nine absolute values , two are measured to @xmath721% , three more are known to @xmath216% , and the remaining four are uncertain at the @xmath7315% level .",
    "measurements of super - allowed and neutron @xmath49-decays@xcite yield @xmath74 .",
    "analysis@xcite of neutral and charged @xmath75 decays ( @xmath76 ) yields @xmath77 , which is verified by a somewhat less precise result from hyperon semi - leptonic decays.@xcite di - muon production in dis of @xmath78 and @xmath79 on nucleons , one muon from a semi - leptonic charm decay , has been examined@xcite , yielding @xmath80 and @xmath81 . from direct production of charm in real @xmath71 decays,@xcite @xmath82 ,",
    "considerably more accurate than dis .",
    "@xmath83 from @xmath84 decays@xcite is consistent but has an error nearly three times larger , due mostly to uncertainty in the form - factor . measurements of the @xmath85-fraction in top quark decays by cdf and d0 result in the rather loose restriction@xcite of @xmath86 where @xmath87 .    the remaining ckm elements ( third row and column ) can be measured with @xmath1-decays .",
    "currently there is information from both inclusive and exclusive semi - leptonic decay branching ratios for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the heavy - to - heavy transition in inclusive @xmath90 is more easily calculable in hqet than for @xmath91 ; the published numbers are @xmath92 from lep@xcite and @xmath93 from cleo,@xcite in which the errors are experimental and theoretical , respectively .",
    "both are subject to the inherent assumption of quark - hadron duality .",
    "exclusive results from lep and cleo for @xmath0 also give results in this range , as seen in section  [ sec : bcex ] .",
    "@xmath94 is difficult due to the enormous charm background over all but the lepton - momentum spectrum s endpoint region , and the difficulty of obtaining the requisite qcd information to extract it from the branching fraction .",
    "two different strategies have emerged .",
    "the inclusive lep analysis includes a wide kinematic range to avoid losing signal statistics but then pays the price of quark - hadron duality and a fine - tuned modeling of charm backgrounds .",
    "cleo restricts itself to exclusive final states ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) using @xmath78-reconstruction , in which there is a more favorable signal - to - noise but a considerable uncertainty in the form - factors .",
    "the lep value@xcite @xmath97 , in which experimental and modeling errors make comparable contributions , is consistent with that from cleo,@xcite @xmath98 , in which the first error is experimental and the second is theoretical .",
    "measurement of the frequency of oscillations in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 systems yields@xcite @xmath99  ps@xmath100 and @xmath101  ps@xmath100 .",
    "relating these to the ckm matrix elements requires knowing @xmath102 for each meson . in the case of",
    "@xmath68 it can be computed using lqcd to within @xmath2120% , yielding @xmath103 .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 is more tractable theoretically than @xmath105 alone due to the cancelation of several factors as well as the feature that only the ratio of bag parameters comes into play , not their absolute values .",
    "lqcd has given @xmath2110% errors in the ratio @xmath106 , translating the @xmath105 limitation to @xmath107 .",
    "two measurements of @xmath6-violation put limits on ckm matrix elements . the relationship of the @xmath6-violating parameter @xmath108 in neutral kaon decay to ckm elements is limited not by experiment but by uncertainty in the bag constant @xmath109 which currently has a @xmath2115% uncertainty .",
    "in contrast , the ut angle @xmath110 is directly sensitive to the magnitude of the asymmetry between mixed and unmixed neutral @xmath68 decays to the same color - suppressed @xmath6 eigenstate , suffering only very small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this explains why it is the first and foremost target of the @xmath1-factories.@xcite although the world average of sin@xmath111 is three standard deviations from zero , it may be prudent to exercise some caution in regarding this as observation of @xmath6 violation , because no single experiment as yet has a two - standard deviation effect .",
    "however , with almost no theoretical uncertainty and systematic errors at the @xmath1120.05 level or better , both belle and babar have the data in hand for such unambiguous discovery .",
    "cleo has a new preliminary analysis of @xmath114 using both @xmath115 and @xmath116 . both signal and @xmath117 backgrounds",
    "are determined by fitting data distributions in a kinematic variable sensitive to their relative contributions .",
    "these fits are performed in bins of a @xmath59-substitute hqet variable @xmath118 , which is the @xmath119 boost in the @xmath1 rest frame and has range @xmath120 .",
    "the fits in a sample @xmath118-bin and the overall resulting raw @xmath118-distributions are shown in fig .",

    "the efficiency - corrected @xmath121 distribution appears in fig .  [",
    "fig : vcb2 ] . both cleo and lep extrapolate to the hqet - friendly , zero - recoil value @xmath118=1 with the same functional form .",
    "the @xmath118-curvature parameter is @xmath122 ( not to be confused with the ckm parameter @xmath38 ) .",
    "the cleo [ lep]@xcite results are @xmath123 [ @xmath124@xmath125 and @xmath126 [ @xmath127 .",
    "cleo finds @xmath128 a smaller @xmath117 background than lep , which instead of fitting the data for background uses a fixed value from a tuned model,@xcite @xmath129 a larger curvature @xmath122 .",
    "these variables are correlated in the final result , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb2 ]",
    ". the lep and cleo results are marginally consistent .",
    "care should be taken in directly comparing @xmath0 s quoted from these analyses , as the lep wg uses@xcite @xmath130 and cleo prefers @xmath131 .",
    "the cleo value is more central to the range of predictions , which have a @xmath215% spread .",
    "using these @xmath132 s makes the @xmath0 s seem closer than they actually are .",
    "cleo has released an interesting new result@xcite for @xmath0 based on the combination of an inclusive @xmath90 analysis and the distributions in two seemingly unconnected variables , the @xmath50 energy in @xmath133 and the hadronic mass - squared in @xmath134 .",
    "the connection is made by hqet , which predicts@xcite the form of the function @xmath135 in @xmath136 , in which @xmath137 represents the mass of light quark and gluon degrees of freedom and @xmath138 the average momentum - squared of the @xmath85-quark inside the @xmath1-meson .",
    "these parameters , in turn , can be determined from the first moments @xmath139 in @xmath133 ( sensitive to @xmath137 only ) and @xmath140 in @xmath134 , where @xmath141 is the spin - averaged @xmath3-mass , @xmath142 ( sensitive to both @xmath137 and @xmath143 ) .",

    "this result is subject to usual quark - hadron duality caveats associated with inclusive analyses.@xcite",
    "[ fig : ckmfour ] shows the allowed bands in the @xmath48-plane from four of the measured quantities . their overlap or lack thereof is a measure of consistency with the standard model , and they can be combined to extract `` best - fit '' results for all the ckm - related quantities .",
    "the experimental and theoretical inputs themselves can be floated in the fits as well .",
    "global fitting efforts which impose unitarity via constrained fits of current experimental and theoretical results start with all these goals .",
    "but very different approaches and considerations of inputs result in quite different conclusions .",
    "partial results of two of the more extensive global fitting efforts , those of hocker @xcite and ciuchini , @xcite are shown graphically in figs .",
    "[ fig : hockerfit ] and [ fig : ciufit ] .",
    "both fits use information available after the summer 2000 conference season .",
    "while the final fit contours both center in the same general @xmath48 region , two significant differences between their analyses stand out : a bayesian vs. frequentist statistical approach to the problem , and the treatment of theoretical errors .",
    "the _ aggressive bayesians _",
    "contend@xcite that lqcd theoretical calculations are sufficiently mature to ascribe probabilistic meanings to central values and uncertainties no different from experimental systematics ; moreover they maintain that a bayesian procedure is entirely justified and results in a clearer interpretation of fit results .",
    "the counter - argument@xcite emphasizes that many of the theoretical inputs are not well - known and therefore can not be treated as having statistical or gaussian errors .",
    "furthermore , the _ conservative frequentist _ viewpoint continues , the more difficult theoretical calculations should be assigned an _ allowed range , without any preferred central value_. for such quantities the theoretical values _ should not contribute _ to the @xmath150 , ranging freely over the entire allowed range for any fixed point in fitting - parameter space .",
    "also pointed out is a pernicious and subtle effect of bayesian combination of as few as three variables specified to have no preferred central value within a range : the bayesian treatment can easily give a fallaciously narrowed and therefore misleading combined fit .",
    "the latter effect occurs even using flat ( rather than gaussian ) probability density functions",
    ". the importance of these differences in approach will increase as more accurate data become available ; it is conceivable that in addition to contrasting `` conservative '' vs. `` aggressive '' errors , they could come to conflicting conclusions on consistency with unitarity .",
    "these are not small considerations , and deserve further attention .",
    "progress in resolving ckm metrology and unitarity consistency is limited by a dearth of robust , accurate , and reliable non - perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "this point is made graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : imagine ] , which shows the dramatic effect on contours in the @xmath151 plane of arbitrarily shrinking contributions from theoretical errors to the 2%-level .",
    "new results from the @xmath1-factories will only serve to highlight the problem by increasing the disparity between experimental and theoretical precision .",
    "lqcd is poised to provide the requisite relief in the coming years ( section  [ sec : qcd ] ) . however , in order to have any credibility , more accurate predictions must be confronted with equally accurate measurements . with only a handful of fundamental adjustable parameters ( quark masses and the strong coupling constant ) , lqcd must be challenged to account for as large a set of observations within its domain as possible . at percent - level precision",
    ", there is now a paucity of the necessary experimental cross - checks available .    the cesr - c / cleo - c@xcite program is designed to fill this experimental void on an ideal time - scale .",
    "the plan calls for @xmath152 datasets of unprecedented size in the tau - charm and @xmath5 energy regimes with a modern , well - seasoned detector over a five year period .",
    "only modest enhancements to the cesr collider , in the form of new superconducting wiggler magnets , are necessary to run in the center - of - mass energy range from @xmath153=3 - 11  gev with peak luminosity scaling as @xmath154 , @xmath155  @xmath156  sec@xmath100 .",
    "few changes to the cleo  iii detector , infrastructure , and analysis tools are required ; cleo - c will easily be the most capable detector to have run in this energy range .",

    "can be measured accurately at pair - production thresholds by flavor - tagging with a fully - reconstructed known decay and looking for the @xmath165 ( and @xmath166 for @xmath164 ) of the appropriate charge and kinematics , thereby measuring the branching fraction .",

    "the ratio @xmath173 , a more straightforward test for theory , will have experimental uncertainties in the 1 - 5% range .",
    "a second vexing issue for heavy flavor physics is the increasing importance of having accurate @xmath3 branching fractions , which are beginning to limit corresponding @xmath1-physics results .",
    "cleo - c can address this issue as well , by measuring the rate of double- to single - tags for the desired modes .",

    "branching fractions will be measured to @xmath211% or better for @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath3 s and @xmath212% for @xmath176 ; correspondingly large improvements over current uncertainties are expected for other modes as well .",
    "a second crucial part of the cleo - c / cesr - c program is to spend time studying the charmonium and bottomonium states , where several qcd prizes await . probing radiative @xmath158 decays for the on - again , off - again @xmath177 should prove decisively whether it exists@xcite and , if so , its status as @xmath178 , glueball , or hybrid .",

    "while it is always risky to bet what someone else is not capable of , charm physics at the @xmath190 faces some obstacles that improve only slowly or not at all with more data .",
    "prime among barriers is the absence of the kinematic constraints available at threshold .",
    "however , extrapolating from previous cleo efforts , keeping such obstacles and potential ways around them in mind , yields optimistically three times larger errors on charm decay constants and branching fractions . if these estimates prove to instead be pessimistic , it will still be true that @xmath191 charm analyses will be systematics - limited in a way that is complementary to cleo - c .",
    "the other competition targeting tau - charm physics is bes  ii at the bepc storage ring in beijing .",

    "the continuing productive interplay among accelerator development , theoretical insight , and experimental technique has brought ckm physics to the threshold of a major transition , one that is qualitative as well as a quantitative .",
    "the @xmath1-factories are operating beyond expectations , promising a rich array of new measurements .",
    "foremost among those would be observation of @xmath6 violation in @xmath1-decays , which can happen with data already in - hand , assuming nature cooperates .",
    "the fortuitously - timed maturation of lqcd along with a reality - grounding cleo - c experimental program should provide crucial breakthroughs in unraveling the effects of strong interactions .",
