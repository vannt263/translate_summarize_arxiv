    "in recent years fractional calculus ( fc ) and fractional differential equations ( fde ) became very popular in many areas of science .",
    "the books dedicated to the applications of fdes published in 2010 - 2011 include @xcite in physics in general , @xcite in modeling and control , @xcite in viscoelasticity , @xcite in systems with long - range interaction .",
    "a good review of applications of fc to chaos in hamiltonian systems is given in @xcite . because fractional derivatives are integro - differential operators , they are used to describe systems distributed in time and/or space : systems with long range interaction @xcite , non - markovian systems with memory ( @xcite ch.10 , @xcite ) , fractal media @xcite , etc .",
    "biological systems are probably the best examples of systems with memory . as it has been shown recently @xcite , even processing of external stimuli by individual neurons can be described by fractional differentiation . in some cases @xcite fdes",
    "are equivalent to the volterra integral equations of the second kind .",
    "this kind of equations ( non necessarily fdes ) is used in nonlinear viscoelasticity ( see for example @xcite ) and in biology ( for applications to mathematical models in population biology and epidemiology see @xcite ) .    as in regular dynamics ( in application to various areas in science ) , the non - linearity plays a significant role in fractional dynamics . chaos and order in nonlinear systems with long range interactions",
    "were considered in @xcite , nonlinear fdes in application to the control were reviewed in books @xcite , nonlinear fractional reaction - diffusion systems considered in gafiychuk2010,guf1,guf2,guf3 . corresponding to the fact that in physical systems the transition from integer order time derivatives to fractional ( of a lesser order ) introduces additional damping similar in appearance to additional friction @xcite , phase spaces of the systems with fractional time derivatives demonstrate different kinds of structures similar to the attractors of the dissipative dynamical systems controlbook2010,zse , th .    as in the case of the systems which can be described by regular differential equations ,",
    "general properties of systems described by fdes can be demonstrated on the examples of maps which can be derived by integrating the fdes ( if it is possible ) over a period of perturbation .",
    "equations of some fractional maps ( fm ) , which include among others fractional standard maps ( fsm ) and fractional dissipative standard maps ( fdsm ) , were derived in a series of recent publications @xcite from the corresponding fdes .",
    "two of the most studied examples in the regular case are the chirikov standard map ( sm ) @xcite and the zaslavsky dissipative standard map ( dsm ) @xcite .",
    "the sm provides the simplest model of the universal generic area preserving map and the description of many physical systems and effects ( fermi acceleration , comet dynamics , etc . )",
    "can be reduced to the studying of the sm .",
    "the topics examined include fixed points , elementary structures of islands and a chaotic sea , and fractional kinetics @xcite .",
    "different properties of the dsm were discussed in @xcite , and a rigorous proof of the existence of chaotic attractor in such type of systems was obtained in @xcite . it was also proved in @xcite that the system of this type exhibits quasi - periodic attractors , periodic sinks , transient chaos with the dynamics attracting to the sink , and the existence of the srb measure for the purely chaotic dynamics .",
    "all this stimulated the study of the fsms @xcite and fdsm @xcite in hope to reveal the most general properties of the fractional dynamics .",
    "two - dimensional maps investigated in @xcite were derived from the fdes ( see section [ be ] ) and , as a result , they are discrete maps with memory in which the present state of evolution depends on all past states",
    ". the earlier studies of maps with memory were done on one - dimensional maps which were not derived from differential equations @xcite .",
    "most results were obtained for the generalizations of the logistic map and the main general result is that the presence of memory makes systems more stable .",
    "the initial study of the fsm in @xcite was concentrated on the investigation of the fixed / periodic points stability of the fsm , new properties and new types of attractors .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite revealed new unusual properties of the fractional attractors of the fsm , which are different not only from the properties of the fixed / periodic points of the non - dissipative systems ( the sm in our case ) , but also from the properties of attractors of the regular ( not fractional ) dissipative systems ( e.g. the dsm ) .",
    "the most unusual observed property of the fsms is the existence ( and persistence ) of the new type of attractors - cascade of bifurcations type trajectories ( cbtt ) . a cascade of bifurcations , when with the change in the value of a parameter a system undergoes a sequence of period - doubling bifurcations , is a well known pathway of a transition form order to chaos . in the case of the cbtt",
    "the period doubling occurs without a change in a system parameter and is an internal property of a system . in section [ r ]",
    "we summarize results of the extensive numerical investigation of three fractional maps to demonstrate the properties of fractional attractors .",
    "an analysis of the conditions for the cbtts appearance will be presented in the following publications .",
    "the standard map in the form    @xmath0    can be derived from the differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 , following the steps proposed by tarasov in @xcite .    the equations for the riemann - liouville fsm ( fsmrl )",
    "were obtained in @xcite and @xcite . following the steps proposed @xcite , the fsmrl in the form which converges to the sm as @xmath3 can be derived from the differential equation with the riemann - liouville fractional derivative describing a kicked system @xmath4 where @xmath2 , with the initial conditions @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a fractional integral .",
    "after integration of equation ( [ diffsmrl ] ) the fsmrl can be written in the form @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and momentum @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 here it is assumed that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the condition @xmath17 is required in order to have solutions bounded at @xmath18 for @xmath19 @xcite . in this form the fsmrl equations in the limiting case @xmath20 coincide with the equations for the standard map under the condition @xmath21 . for consistency and in order to compare corresponding results for all three maps ( the sm , the fsmrl , and the caputo fsm ( fsmc ) ) all trajectories considered in this article have the initial condition @xmath21 .    following the steps proposed @xcite , the fsmc in the form which converges to the sm as @xmath3 can be derived from the differential equation similar to ( [ diffsmrl ] ) but with the caputo fractional derivative @xmath22 where @xmath2 , with the initial conditions @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25    integrating equation ( [ diffsmc ] ) with the momentum defined as @xmath26 and assuming @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "the fsmrl has no periodicity in @xmath32 and can not be considered on a torus .",
    "this fact is related to the definition of momentum ( [ momrl ] ) and initial conditions ( [ fsmrlic ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the phase portraits of two fsms is still possible if we compare the values of the @xmath31 coordinates on the trajectories corresponding to the same values of the maps parameters .",
    "the dsm in the form @xmath34 @xmath35 can be derived integrating the differential equation of the the kicked damped rotator ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath36    two forms of the fdsm were derived in @xcite .",

    "it appears that the dependence of the sm s fixed point ( 0,0 ) stability properties on the map parameter @xmath48 plays an important role when transition to the fsms is considered .",

    "this t=2 trajectory becomes unstable but it gives birth to two @xmath51 trajectories @xcite with @xmath55 these @xmath51 trajectories become unstable when @xmath56 ( see figure  [ figkc]a ) , at the point where @xmath57 stable trajectories are born .",
    "this period doubling cascade of bifurcations sequence continues with @xmath58 and @xmath59 stable trajectories appearing at @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspondingly .",
    "it continues until at @xmath62 all periodic points become unstable and corresponding islands disappear .",
    "this scenario of the elliptic - hyperbolic point transitions with the births of the double periodicity islands inside the original island has been investigated in @xcite and applied to investigate the sm stochasticity at low values of the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "stability of the fixed point ( 0,0 ) has been considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that for fractional values of @xmath64 ( we consider only @xmath65 ) this point turns from elliptic ( for @xmath66 ) into a sink which is stable for @xmath67 where @xmath68 and can be calculated numerically ( see figure  [ figkc]a ) . it can be shown that @xmath69 , which corresponds to the sm case .",
    "the structure of the fsm phase space for @xmath70 preserves some features which exist in the @xmath66 case .",
    "namely , stable higher period points , which exist in the sm case , still exist in the fsm , but they exist in the asymptotic sense and they transform into sinks or , in the fsmrl case , into attracting slow ( @xmath71 ) diverging trajectories ( asdt ) ( see figure  [ figlowk ] )",
    ".    pure chaotic trajectories disappear .",
    "each attractor has its own basin of attraction .",
    "the traces of the sm chaotic sea exist in the following sense : initially close trajectories , which do not start from any basin of attraction , may fall into absolutely different attractors . in most of the cases attracting points",
    "themselves do not belong to their own basins of attraction : trajectory which starts from an attracting point may fall into a different attractor .",
    "the fsmrl trajectories which converge to the fixed point follow two different routs .",
    "trajectories which start from the basin of attraction converge according to the power law @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while those starting from the outside of the basin of attraction are attracting slow converging trajectories ( asct ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "all fsmc trajectories converging to @xmath76 fixed point follow the slow power law @xmath77 and @xmath75 ( see figure  [ figlowkstab ] ) .",
    "this convergence may correspond to the recently introduced for the fractional dynamic systems notion of the generalized mittag - leffler stability @xcite , for which the power - law stability is a special case .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that , as in the sm case , in the fsms a period @xmath51 antisymmetric trajectory ( sink ) exists ( asymptotically ) for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 in the sm case ) with @xmath81 asymptotic existence and stability of this sink is a result of the gradual transformation of the sm s elliptic point with the decrease in the order of derivative from @xmath82 ( see figure  [ figt2as ] ) . as in the fixed point case , there are two types of convergence of the trajectories to the fsmrl @xmath51 sink : fast with @xmath83 and slow with @xmath84 and @xmath85 convergence in the fsmc case @xcite .",
    "let s consider the fsmrl and assume the asymptotic existence of the @xmath51 sink @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the limit @xmath88 in ( [ fsmrlp ] ) and ( [ fsmrlx ] ) gives @xmath89 @xmath90 the equation for @xmath91 takes the form @xmath92 from which the condition of the existence of the @xmath51 sink is @xmath93 from ( [ kcr1 ] ) it follows that @xmath94 .",

    "the sm s @xmath51 antisymmetric trajectory becomes unstable when @xmath101 , at the point in phase space where a pair of @xmath51 trajectories with @xmath102 , @xmath103 appears .",

    ".      in the sm further increase in @xmath48 at @xmath112 causes an elliptic - hyperbolic point transition when @xmath51 points become unstable and stable @xmath57 elliptic points appear .",
    "a period doubling cascade of bifurcations leads to the disappearance of the corresponding islands of stability in the chaotic sea at @xmath61 .",
    "the cusp in figure  [ figkc]a points to approximately this spot ( @xmath20 , @xmath113 ) .",
    "inside of the band leading to the cusp a new type of the fsm s attractors appears : cascade of bifurcations type trajectories ( cbtt ) ( see figure  [ figcbtt ] ) . in cbtts period doubling cascade of bifurcations",
    "occurs on a single trajectory without any change in the map parameter . in some cases cbtts",
    "behave like sticky islands of the hamiltonian dynamics : occasionally a trajectory enters a cbtt and then leaves it entering the chaotic sea . near",
    "the cusp cbtts are barely distinguishable - the relative time trajectories spend in cbtts is small . with decrease in @xmath64",
    "the relative time trajectories spend in cbtts increases and at @xmath64 close to one a trajectory enters a cbtt after a few iterations and stays there over the longest computational time we were able to run our codes - 500000 iterations .",
    "a typical fsmc s cbtt of this kind is presented in the figure  [ figmix]c .",
    "cbtts , easily recognizable in the phase space of the fsmrl ( figure  [ figcbtt]a ) , often almost impossible to distinguish in the phase space of the fsmc ( figure  [ figcbtt]b ) .",
    "but they clearly reveal themselves on a coordinate versus time ( step of iteration @xmath108 ) plot ( figure  [ figcbtt]c ) .",
    "the main feature of the sm s phase space at @xmath114 , which defines dynamics and transport and is well investigated ( see for example @xcite ) , is the presence of the sticky accelerator mode islands .",
    "slight decrease in the order of derivative turns accelerator mode islands into attracting accelerator mode trajectories ( amt ) ( figure  [ figmix]a ) .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath48 and @xmath64 trajectories either permanantly sink into this attractor , or intermittently stick to it and return to the chaotic sea .",
    "amts do not exist ( we were unable to find them ) for @xmath115 .",
    "in the ( @xmath116)-plot ( figure  [ figkc]a ) the area of the amt existence is a part ( @xmath114 ) of a very narrow strip near @xmath20 line . in the area of the @xmath116-plot above the cbtt strip ( we considered only @xmath117 ) different kinds of chaotic attractors ( or possibly pure chaotic behavior ) can be found .",
    "two examples are presented in figure  [ figmix ] .",
    "figure  [ figmix]c contains two overlapping attractors one of which is a cbtt .",
    "existence of the overlapping attractors and intersecting trajectories is a feature of maps with memory which is impossible in a regular dynamical systems .",
    "the simplest example of intersecting trajectories can be constructed by starting one trajectory at an arbitrary point @xmath95 and then the second at @xmath118 .",
    "consideration of the fdsm in @xcite demonstrated that already a small deviation of @xmath64 from @xmath119 leads to significant changes in properties of the map .",
    "for example , a window of ballistic motion which exists in zaslavsky map near @xmath120 is closing when @xmath121 .",
    "further decrease in @xmath64 at @xmath122 produces different kinds of chaotic attractors and sinks @xcite .",
    "some of the new features we observed , which are presented in figure  [ figfdsm ] , include inverse cascade of bifurcations and trajectories which start as a cbtt and then converge as an inverse cascade of bifurcations . in phase space",
    "those trajectories may look like chaotic attractors .",
    "we studied three different fractional maps which describe nonlinear systems with memory under periodic perturbations ( kicks in our case ) .",
    "the types of solutions which we found in all maps include periodic sinks , attracting slow diverging trajectories , attracting accelerator mode trajectories , chaotic attractors , and cascade of bifurcations type trajectories .",
    "new features discovered include attractors which overlap , trajectories which intersect , and cbtts .",
    "the models with a similar behavior may include periodically kicked media which can be described by fdes : viscoelastic materials @xcite or dielectrics @xcite .",
    "experiments can be proposed to observe different kinds of solution , for example cbtts , in those media .",
    "nonlinear models with memory which have chaotic and periodic solutions , where cascades of bifurcations considered as a result of a change in a system parameter , are used in population biology and epidemiology @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that such behavior can be a consequence of the essential internal properties of the systems with memory and suggest construction of new fractional models of biological systems .",
    "our computational results are based on the runs over more that @xmath123 periods of perturbations . due to the integro - differential nature of the fractional derivatives , at present time it is impossible to solve fdes over more than @xmath124 periods of oscillations .",
    "our results suggest a new way of looking for a particular solutions of the fdes .",
    "for example , we may suggest that cbtts can be found at the values of system parameters , where in corresponding integer system a period doubling cascade of bifurcations leads to the disappearance of a system of islands .",
