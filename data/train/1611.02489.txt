    "deuteron scattering from composite nuclei is , in general , a many - body problem , but very often it is treated as three - body problem in a system consisting of proton ( @xmath2 ) , neutron ( @xmath3 ) , and inert nuclear core @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the interactions between nucleons and core are modeled by effective optical potentials ( ops ) ; there is a large variety of phenomenological parametrizations @xcite . in some cases such models",
    "are successful in describing the experimental data , and in some cases fail , calling for improvements in the op or the dynamical model , e.g. , by including the excitation of the core @xcite .",
    "in particular cases the failures can be seen already in the nucleon - nucleus two - body system .",
    "for example , standard optical potentials were found to be unable to account for precise large - angle nucleon - nucleus elastic differential cross section data above 20 mev lab energy for stable closed - shell nuclei such as @xmath5 or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is not very surprising given significant momentum transfer in that regime and possible excitations .",
    "it was argued @xcite that these effects give rise to parity- ( @xmath7 ) or angular - momentum ( @xmath8 ) dependent components in the op .",
    "indeed , with such additional terms the description of large - angle differential cross section data was significantly improved @xcite .",
    "naturally one may raise the question what consequences the improvements and new op terms have on three - body reaction observables .",
    "unfortunately , explicitly @xmath7- or @xmath8-dependent ops are not suitable for standard practical calculations within distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , adiabatic wave approximation ( adwa ) and continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) frameworks .",
    "however , exact faddeev - type theory , implemented in individual partial - wave representations for all three involved pairs , is capable of using such @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependent potentials .",
    "thus , the aim of the present work is to study three - body nuclear reactions with @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependent ops .",
    "we choose @xmath9 elastic and transfer reactions as a working example .",
    "however , all existing @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependent op parametrizations for nucleon-@xmath5 are local @xcite , while in ref .  @xcite it was found that the perey - buck - type exchange nonlocality of the op is important in three - body reactions , especially for transfer .",
    "for this reason we create several nonlocal parametrizations of @xmath7- and @xmath8-dependent ops , fitted to the same experimental data @xcite as the local ones @xcite .    in sec .",

    "@xcite , i.e. , same data that constrain the local op of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , also geometric parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 have been varied , typically within 10% of original values @xcite , to improve the fit quality .",
    "the parameters defining the @xmath8-dependence turn out to be comparable to the local case @xcite , i.e. , typically @xmath21 and @xmath22 . note that some local op parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite depend strongly on the collision energy and that dependence is not smooth , reflecting the fact that backward - angle experimental data exhibit non - monotonic energy dependence , probably due to the presence of resonant proton - nucleus states .",
    "we emphasize that in three - body reactions the energy of each interacting two - body subsystem formally runs from the available three - body energy to @xmath23 , but , in order to have a single three - body hamiltonian and thereby preserve a hamiltonian theory @xcite , it is preferable to use two - body potentials with fixed sets of parameters ; the results in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] are obtained following this strategy .",
    "the ability of the op to account for the two - body reaction data over a broader energy regime may be important for its success in three - body reactions and deserves investigation . the nonlocal op , at least to some extent , is able to absorb smooth energy dependence of data into nonlocality , but far less a non - smooth behavior .",
    "thus , we have not achieved a single parameter set describing the data over the full angular regime at all energies .",
    "in fact , the analyzing power data are only accounted for center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "scattering angles @xmath24 up to about @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , when we fit the experimental data at a given energy , the resulting op reproduces well the data for other energies at @xmath26 and only fails at backward angles where the differential cross section is very small .",
