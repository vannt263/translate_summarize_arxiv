    "in the last few decades there was a considerable development in the theoretical description and experimental measurement of differential cross sections for charged particle impact ionization of atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the interest is focused on the in - detail analysis of the electron ejection from atomic or molecular targets @xcite .",
    "these analyzes may be performed by measuring and calculating fully differential cross sections which gives us the most complete information about an ionization process .",
    "these quantities describe the entire energy and angular distribution of the ionized electron , residual ion and projectile .    previously , based on the semiclassical impact parameter method",
    "we have constructed a theoretical model to calculate fully differential cross sections for single ionization of light atoms .",
    "this model takes into account the projectile ",
    "target nucleus interaction classically .",
    "the method was tested in case of the single ionization of helium produced by c@xmath1 ion projectile with an energy of @xmath2 mev / u and good agreement with the experiments was achieved in the scattering plane , while in the perpendicular plane a structure similar to that observed experimentally was obtained @xcite .",
    "more complex and interesting features appear when the target is a molecule . due to the multicenter character of the target , interference patterns occur in the ejected electron spectra .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in the double differential cross section ( ddcs ) data for the ionization of hydrogen molecule by fast ions by stolterfoht @xcite and has been analyzed theoretically by several groups @xcite .",
    "recently , fully differential cross sections were measured and calculated for the ionization of h@xmath0 by both fast and slow electrons @xcite , and interference effects were analyzed in these data series . however , while several attempts have been made in the description of the interference effects in the double differential cross sections , and these effects are relatively well understood @xcite , it was shown recently @xcite , that an accurate description of the role of the projectile  target nucleus interaction remains a major challenge to theory .",
    "there are even much more details to clarify for these effects , if they appear in the total differential cross section .",
    "interference effects due to indistinguishable diffraction of the incoming projectile from the two atomic centers were identified in the ddcs as a function of scattering angle for fixed ejected electron energy @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that these kinds of interference structures can be more pronounced , that those in the ejected electron spectrum .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to adopt our previous semiclassical method @xcite to calculate fully differential cross sections ( fdcs ) for the ionization of the hydrogen molecule , and to evidence the interference effects due to the two - center character of the target . in this model ,",
    "the description of the molecule is similar to that from paper @xcite , where total cross sections are calculated and are compared to the experimental data . due to the limitations of a semiclassical model ,",
    "we study the ionization induced by fast charged projectiles , and analyze the interference structures only in the ejected electron spectra .    as a test case , the single ionization of the hydrogen molecule by 4 kev electron and 6 mev proton projectiles is considered .",
    "fdcs are calculated and compared in the scattering plane with the experimental data of cherid @xcite and dimopoulou @xcite .",
    "results in the perpendicular plane are also presented . in order to evidence the interference effects due to the two - center character of the target ,",
    "the fully differential ionization cross sections for the h@xmath0 molecule and h atom are compared .",
    "in the semiclassical approximation the projectile is treated separately and it moves along a classical trajectory .",
    "this implies that only the electron system needs to be described by a time - dependent schrdinger equation , while the projectile follows the classical laws of motion .      in order to study the ionization process of a small molecule induced by fast charged projectiles ,",
    "first the ionization amplitudes have to be calculated .",
    "as described in @xcite , the first - order transition amplitude for a projectile with impact parameter @xmath3 , velocity @xmath4 and charge @xmath5 , and a certain orientation of the molecular axis @xmath6 may be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position vector of the active electron and @xmath9 is the position of the projectile along the trajectory with @xmath10 . here",
    "the origin is considered in the center of the molecule .",
    "the @xmath11 is the energy transfer to the active electron , where @xmath12 stands for the ionization energy .",
    "the initial and final state of the active electron is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 its momentum vector . in the calculations the coulomb interaction @xmath16 is expanded into a multipole series .",
    "the transition probability for a given impact parameter and orientation of the molecular axis is the square of the transition amplitude modulus @xmath17 because in experiments the molecular orientation is usually unknown , the transition probabilities are averaged over molecular orientation @xmath18    finally , the triple differential cross section ( tdcs ) for the electron ejected in the energy range @xmath19 $ ] and into the solid angle @xmath20 and the projectile scattered into the solid angle @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath22 because some experimental data @xcite are differential relative to the perpendicular momentum transfer @xmath23 , we calculate also a fdcs expressed in terms of @xmath23 and not of the scattering angle @xmath24    an important part of the model is to assign impact parameter values to certain projectile scattering angles .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite , this may be achieved using the transverse momentum balance @xcite , which states that the momentum transfer is the sum of the transverse components of the electron s and residual ion s momenta .",
    "further it is assumed , that the impact parameter is related to the momentum transfer to the residual ion , and we take into account the projectile - electron interaction separately .",
    "thus , in this model , the projectile  target nucleus interaction is accounted for . by this point of view two",
    "main collision types are possible : ( a ) binary collision where most of the momentum transfer is taken by the electron and ( b ) recoil collision where most of the momentum transfer is taken by the target nucleus .",
    "accordingly , two different impact parameter values have to be used in these collision regimes . the transition between these impact parameters",
    "is realized smoothly in the transition regions .",
    "the projectile scattering is treated as a classical potential scattering problem in the field of the target system with nuclear charge @xmath25 @xcite . the simplest way to include",
    "the effect of the electrons around the target nucleus is to consider the potential to be a product of the coulomb potential and the bohr - type screening function @xcite .",
    "here it has to be mentioned , that using this potential we assume that the projectile scattering is produced by a spherical potential .",
    "this implies that in the description of the projectile scattering the two - center nature of the molecule is neglected .",
    "while in the analysis of the cross section as a function of the projectile scattering angle the correct description of the projectile ",
    "target nucleus interaction is important @xcite , we assume that the present approximation does not influence significantly the character of our results as a function of electron ejection angle .      in the particular case of the hydrogen molecule the initial state is represented by a heitler - london type molecular wavefunction . written only for the active electron @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the effective charge , @xmath28 is the vector associated to the internuclear distance and @xmath29 denotes a normalization factor . in order to separate the dependence on the direction @xmath30 of the molecular axis ,",
    "this is expanded into a legendre series @xcite . in this series",
    "each term is characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath31 . in the followings , the expansion coefficients depending only on the molecular distances",
    "will be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath14 continuum wavefunction is expanded into partial wave series , depending on angular momenta @xmath33 and phaseshift @xmath34 .",
    "the radial part @xmath35 is a wavefunction of the continuum electron moving in the mean field of the residual h@xmath36 molecular ion approximated by the potential @xmath37 this wavefunction is calculated numerically .    by these considerations",
    "the ionization amplitude will be @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the normalization factors of the initial and final state target wavefunctions , respectively .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath41 corresponds to the multipole expansion of the coulomb interaction and @xmath42 is the integral over the projectile trajectory .    using this expression ,",
    "the transition probability is calculated and averaged over molecular orientation .",
    "the fdcs for ionization of the hydrogen molecule will look as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant depending on projectile charge , velocity and scattering angle , target charge and ejected electron momentum and it differs for the different kinds of fdcs mentioned earlier ( see equations ( [ fdcs3 ] ) and ( [ fdcs5 ] ) ) . while our results will be represented scaled to unity at their highest value in the scattering plane , in our following discussion the @xmath44 constant will play the role of a simple scaling constant .",
    "in order to test the validity of the results of the semiclassical model for the h@xmath0 ionization , calculated fdcs for fast electron and proton projectile impact are compared to the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows fully differential cross sections for the ionization of the hydrogen molecule by 4.087 kev electron impact .",
    "the projectile scattering angle is @xmath45 and the ejected electron energy is 20 ev .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows tdcs in the scattering plane , while the bottom panel shows the same data in the perpendicular plane .",
    "experimental and theoretical data are each scaled to unity at their highest value in the scattering plane .",
    "together with the results for the molecule ( continuous line ) , tdcs are shown for the same collision process with atomic hydrogen target ( dashed line ) .",
    "further comment needs the fact that the tdcs in the scattering plane for atomic hydrogen target show shoulder structures at angles around 45@xmath46 and 135@xmath46 .",
    "such structures can not occur for pure first - order ionization from an isotropic 1s state . as presented above , in order to take into account the projectile ",
    "target nucleus interaction , a certain impact parameter is assigned for every kinematic condition .",
    "two different impact parameter values are used in the two collision regimes .",
    "the transition between these impact parameters is realized smoothly in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 transition regions .",
    "the shoulders appear due to this impact parameter adaptation mechanism .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in the scattering plane the theory reproduces well in shape the binary and the recoil peak structure .",
    "however , the semiclassical first - order results show a shift of the binary peak with some @xmath49 relative to the experimental data , which have the angular resolution of less than 1@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "such peak shifts indicates that the first order approximation may not be sufficiently accurate .",
    "experimental data in the perpendicular plane for this particular process was not found . as in the case of our previous studies of the he ionization @xcite ,",
    "the semiclassical theoretical results show a double - lobe structure similar to that reported in the literature for slower collision processes @xcite .    in order to evidence the interference effects due to the two - center nature of the target , tdcs for the h@xmath0 molecule and h atom",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "the only difference between these calculations is that the one - center wavefunction describing the h atom is replaced by a two - center wavefunction in case of the molecular target . at the first",
    "look the tdcs distributions for h@xmath0 molecule and h atom are very similar .",
    "however , the recoil peak for the h@xmath0 target is larger than that for the h atom .",
    "the interference effects are analyzed later by the means of the interference factor .",
    "we note here , that we obtain the interference structures by comparing the theoretical results for h@xmath0 and h. because the agreement between our calculations and the experimental data is not perfect , we can not say , that have identified the interference effects in the experimental data .",
    "we have identified the interference effects in the electron ejection spectrum , due to the coherent ejection from the two centers of the molecule .",
    "this effect is obtained by describing the molecular electron by a two - center wavefunction .",
    "we assume , that neglecting the two - center character of the target in the description of the projectile scattering does not influence the obtained interference patterns .",
    "the interference structures in the ejected electron spectrum are analyzed through the interference factor defined by the ratio of the cross section obtained for the molecule and of two independent hydrogen atoms @xcite @xmath50 this interference effect may be detected in the tdcs distribution from non oriented molecules .",
    "the interference factor may be expressed by an analytical approximate formula @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the momentum imparted to the recoil ion .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the interference factor obtained from our calculations ( continuous line ) is shown for the ionization process discussed earlier and it is compared to the analytical form ( [ analyticali ] ) ( dashed line ) .",
    "the top panel of the figure shows the interference factor in the scattering plane . as expected , it has oscillatory behavior with a strong maximum in the vicinity of the recoil peak .",
    "the semiclassical theory predicts another smaller maximum in the binary peak region , too , suggesting a more complicated behavior than that given by the analytical formula . in the perpendicular plane due to the kinematic conditions the @xmath53 momentum is constant : ( 1 ) the transverse component of the recoil momentum @xmath53 parallel to @xmath54 is constant because the electron momentum is zero in that direction and @xmath54 is fixed ; ( 2 ) the transverse component of @xmath53 perpendicular to @xmath54 is constant because @xmath54 is zero in that direction and the electron energy is fixed .",
    "accordingly , the analytical formula gives a constant interference factor .",
    "in contrast to this result , the semiclassical theory predicts some oscillations symmetric relative to the @xmath55 direction ( bottom panel of the figure ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm    tdcs distributions for other projectile energies and scattering angles are analyzed in fig .",
    "the top and middle panels present scattering plane tdcs results for 4.087 kev electron projectile with @xmath56 and @xmath57 scattering angles .",
    "the ionized electron is ejected with 20 ev energy .",
    "the results are in good agreement with experiments both in the shape of the distribution and in the position of binary and recoil peaks .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows results for 4.167 kev projectile energy and a larger @xmath58 scattering angle .",
    "the electron is ejected with a higher energy , of 100 ev . in this case",
    "the experiments show a narrow binary peak , which is well reproduced by our calculations .",
    "= 7.5 cm    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows fdcs results of the semiclassical model for ionization of hydrogen molecule by 6 mev proton projectile impact . in this case",
    "the experimental data of dimopoulou @xcite is differential in ejected electron momentum vector and the perpendicular momentum transfer vector .",
    "the comparison is made for different electron ejection energies and momentum transfers .",
    "on one hand , for larger electron energies , of @xmath59 ev ( top panels of the figure ) the agreement between the experimental data and the present , semiclassical theory is reasonably good .",
    "beside of this , it has to be noted that our first - order results show a shift of the binary peak with some @xmath49 , but because of the experimental errors in the cross section this shift can not be determined precisely .",
    "the cross section ratios for the binary and recoil peaks are also well reproduced .",
    "on the other hand , for lower electron energies , of @xmath60 ev ( bottom panels of the figure ) there is a discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical fdcs distributions . in experiments",
    "the cross section ratio of the binary and recoil peaks is almost 1 .",
    "this feature is not reproduced by the semiclassical model .",
    "the explanation is the same as in the case of cdw - eis model @xcite : the fdcs distribution in the sub - ev region is influenced by the presence of the vibrational autoionizing channel ( not included into the semiclassical model ) which leads to the ejection of very low - energy electrons .",
    "the angular distribution of the autoionized electrons is essentially a dipolar one with respect to the momentum transfer axis .",
    "in conclusion , the theoretical model based on the first order , semiclassical , impact parameter approximation used to calculate fully differential cross sections for single ionization of light atoms has been adopted to calculate fully differential cross sections for the ionization of diatomic molecules .",
    "the method has been tested in case of the ionization of h@xmath0 by 4 kev electron and 6 mev proton projectiles . except for some special cases , the obtained results in the scattering plane show good agreement with the experiments @xcite , and are in agreement with other theories @xcite . the double - lobe structure reported in the perpendicular plane",
    "is also reproduced . however",
    ", for low electron ejection energies the semiclassical model fails to reproduce the experimentally observed more symmetrical electron emission patterns in the scattering plane . in order to analyze the effect of the two scattering centers of the molecule on the cross section ,",
    "we have compared the tdcs for the h@xmath0 with the tdcs obtained for independent atoms .",
    "higher cross sections were obtained for molecules in the region of the recoil peak , and also the width of the binary peak was changed .",
    "these differences may be interpreted as interference effects .",
    "the aim of this work was to test that the semiclassical model , in its simple form , is able to treat complex colliding systems and describe interference patterns in the fully differential cross sections , too .",
    "the present work has been supported by the romanian national plan for research ( pn ii ) , contract no .",
