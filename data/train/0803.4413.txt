    "surface - attached polymers are an ubiquitous phenomenon in living matter . on the cellular level ,",
    "prominent examples are the cytoskeletal actin network beneath the cell s plasma membrane @xcite and the extracellular matrix @xcite .",
    "while the semiflexible actin polymers interact at multiple sites with the intracellular face of the cell s membrane , the dominant component of the extracellular matrix , the hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , rather is a flexible polymer , end - grafted to the extracellular face of the membrane and extending to the cell s environment . to provide an efficient barrier that is capable of protecting the cell , extracellular ha is modified by rigid aggrecan combs that are linked to the flexible ha backbone . as a consequence",
    ", the cell is protected by a jungle of ha - aggrecan complexes .",
    "we have previously shown that attaching a single rigid side chain to a flexible , end - grafted polymer ( resembling the ha - aggrecan complex ) can lead to a considerable stiffening of the backbone @xcite , hinting at a mechanism by which cells can tune the rigidity of their protective matrix . in this study",
    ", we had used a dynamic monte carlo algorithm on a regular cubic lattice to study the steady - state properties of a flexible , end - grafted backbone polymer with a rigid side chain . extending this approach to a system of many interacting backbones , however",
    ", is computationally challenging due to the massive increase in the system s autocorrelation time .",
    "an alternative approach to a brute - force monte carlo sampling is a further coarse graining of the system that reduces the problem to its basic observables , namely the height of the backbones and the orientation of the rigid side chains . here",
    ", a combination of the potts model ( describing the height levels ) and the two - dimensional xy - model ( describing the orientation of the side chains ) appears as a promising candidate . using this approach",
    ", however , one has to deal with an intricate problem of statistical physics  the prediction of the system s phase behavior and phase transition . the potts model ( with @xmath0 height levels )",
    "undergoes a second order phase transition @xcite while the two - dimensional xy - model shows a kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "it is far from evident which phase transition will be encountered when coupling these two systems .",
    "aiming at modeling the behavior of the extracellular matrix in terms of such a combined model thus requires to elucidate the model s phase behavior in the first place .",
    "inspired by the potential value of the combined potts - xy - model in describing features of the extracellular matrix , we have investigated the phase transition of the model .",
    "in particular , we have studied the phase transition in a model that couples the @xmath1 potts model with the xy - model by means of extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the phase transition is dominated by the potts model , i.e. a second order phase transition is observed .",
    "the ordered state at low temperatures shows domains of parallel aligned xy - spins with the potts levels collectively exploring all states in a stochastic fashion .",
    "in contrast , for high temperatures the xy - spins are disordered with an average potts level @xmath2 that only varies to a minor extent .",
    "relating these findings to the original biological problem , we speculate that changing the interaction strength between individual ha - aggrecan complexes , i.e. driving the system through the phase transition , may be one way for the cell to build up a stochastically fluctuating protective barrier .",
    "as described previously @xcite , the basic unit of the extracellular matrix may be reduced to a single flexible , end - grafted backbone with a rigid side chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig01 ] ) .",
    "while a simulation of this unit yields valuable insights into the stiffening of the individual backbone due to the attached rigid side chain , many of the details may not be necessary to understand the generic behavior of the multi - complex system .",
    "the basic quantities describing the interaction of many individual units are the height @xmath3 of each side chain above the substrate and its orientation angle @xmath4 with respect to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "thus , the individual backbone side - chain complexes are interpreted as mutually interacting rotors aligned on a regular two - dimensional lattice .     of the side chain above the substrate and its orientation angle @xmath4 ,",
    "are retained .",
    "a system of mutually interacting complexes is obtained by using a two - dimensional lattice of such rotors ( right ) where the dynamics is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hybrid_model ] ) .",
    ", width=264 ]    we assume here that the sites at which the backbones are attached to the substrate are sufficiently far aparat from each other so that any interaction between the complexes is mediated by the side chains only .",
    "this also means that side chains only interact when they have the same height @xmath3 .",
    "this aspect can be modeled by a potts - type hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 denotes the height of side chain @xmath8 above the substrate , @xmath9 is the total number of allowed heights , and @xmath10 is the coupling constant ( in units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the interaction between side chains with the same @xmath3 will be considered as a nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction leading to a prefered parallel alignment of the side chains .",
    "this kind of interaction seems plausible as a first approach since it mimics the repulsive forces between side chains that may be due to steric or short - ranged electrostatic potentials .",
    "consequently , we use for this part of the interaction the two - dimensional xy - model hamiltonian : @xmath12 with the coupling constant @xmath13 and @xmath14 denoting a summation over nearest neighbors . for simplicity ,",

    "close to the critical temperature , the standard metropolis mc suffers from critical slowing down , i.e. it becomes difficult to generate enough statistically independent configurations for a reliable statistics . to overcome this problem",
    ", we used a cluster mc approach @xcite , i.e. a modification of wolff s cluster algorithm @xcite . here , one deals with two degrees of freedom , one discrete ( potts level @xmath3 ) and one continuous ( orientation angle @xmath4 ) .",

    "in contrast to the standard metropolis mc method it allowed for extensive simulations of large systems close to @xmath22 due to a reduced dynamic exponent .",
    "we focussed on the inner energy @xmath38 as we found no proper order parameter to follow the phase behavior of the hybrid model .",

    "[ fig : fig04]a ) .",
    "thus , the energy distribution assumes a gauss - like shape in the thermodynamic limit , consistent with a second - order phase transition with only a single phase existing in the system at @xmath22 .",

    "given our results , it seems reasonable to call the hybrid model rather a modified potts model than a modified xy - model as the phase behavior of the system is dominated by the 3-state potts model : at low temperatures , the rotors essentially condensate into a single potts state .",
    "this corresponds to the ( three - fold degenerate ) ground state of the potts model showing long - range order with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "excitations in this regime arise due to perturbations in the ordered state of the xy - model . at high temperatures ,",
    "the influence of the xy degree of freedom becomes manifest as a randomized coupling of the potts spins which includes the existence of vacancies that may drive the transition of the 3-state potts model from second to first order @xcite .",

    "coming back to the original problem that inspired the model , i.e. the dynamics of the extracellular matrix , the observed ordering of the system for @xmath41 may actually be used by a cell to change the thickness of its protective layer .",
    "a cell may use the transition to the regime @xmath41 to freeze the extracellular matrix in a desired homogenous ordered state / height that is not necessarily thicker than in the disordered regime .",
    "thus , speaking in terms of the original problem , the cell may tune the thickness of its extracellular matrix by tuning the interactions of the ( polyelectrolytic ) aggrecan side chains , thereby driving the system through the phase transition .",
    "it will be interesting to experimentally manipulate the aggrecan interaction by changing ion conditions for the extracellular matrix and thereby to induce the above described phase transition .",
