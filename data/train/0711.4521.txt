    "to the best of the author s knowledge , no plasma has ever been observed to make a kepler orbit around the sun , a planet , or a moon .",
    "for example , the earth s magnetotail does not make kepler orbits around the earth nor does the solar wind make a kepler orbit around the sun .",
    "this is puzzling because in the astrophysical literature plasmas are routinely presumed to make near - kepler orbits in the presence of the gravitational field of a central object , e.g. , accretion disks are modeled as mhd  plasmas in a near - kepler orbit around a central object .",
    "the qualifier ` near ' is used because it is conventionally presumed for gases and plasmas that a radial gradient  of an isotropic pressure exists and that this pressure gradient provides a modest outward force which slightly reduces the amount of centrifugal force required to balance the inward force of gravity and so achieve a stable circular orbit ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the implications of this effect in the context of a system consisting of gas and solid particles ) .",
    "if kepler orbiting plasmas are so ubiquitous in astrophysics , then why is there not even a single example in the great variety of plasma / gravitational situations in our own solar system ?",
    "a kepler orbit is essentially a property of a single point particle  it is not a property of a collection of independent point particles .",
    "for example , earth and mars are individually in kepler orbits around the sun , but the center of mass of earth and mars is not in a kepler orbit around the sun .",
    "if one replaced earth and mars by some statistically large number of point particles , then each could be in its own kepler orbit around the sun , but the center of mass of this configuration would not be in a kepler orbit",
    ".    a collisional gas in a container could be in a kepler orbit around the sun because the walls of the container _ bind _ the particles to stay within a fixed distance of the center of mass so that the entire system can be considered as a point particle located at the center of mass .",
    "the transition from single point particle behavior to the behavior of a group of particles can be seen by considering a moon in close orbit around a massive planet .",
    "the tidal forces resulting from the gradient of the planet s gravitational force can be so strong as to overcome the binding forces and fracture the moon .",
    "the fragments would then follow distinct individual kepler orbits and the center of mass of these orbits would not follow a kepler orbit . similarly , in order for a gas ( or plasma ) to have its center of mass follow a kepler orbit there would have to be some binding force , such as would be provided by container walls , that would prevent the particle constituents of the gas ( or plasma ) from separating onto distinct kepler orbits .",
    "collisions might provide binding at the interior of a gas cloud , but not at the periphery because particles at the periphery moving away from the center would not encounter other particles with which they could collide .",
    "the periphery would simply expand into vacuum if there is no wall to prevent this expansion and the particles constituting the periphery would make kepler orbits substantially different from the kepler orbit calculated for the center of mass .",
    "accretion disks are composed of dust and gas and the dust to gas mass ratio is estimated @xcite to range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 uv radiation photo - ionizes @xcite the dust and gas so the accretion disk can be considered as a dusty plasma @xcite consisting of charged dust grains , electrons , and ions . the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite and the unipolar induction dynamo ( uid ) @xcite assume accretion disks are axisymmetric ideal mhd  plasmas and neglect dusty plasma physics effects .",
    "the mri  and uid  additionally assume that accretion disks obey both kepler dynamics and ideal mhd .",
    "thus accretion disks are considered to be ideal mhd  plasmas in a circular kepler orbit about a central object ; they are supposed to conserve angular momentum and have frozen - in magnetic flux .",
    "one can then ask what does the trajectory of an individual particle in the accretion disk look like .",
    "since mhd is assumed and mhd  is based on the assumption that all particles make cyclotron orbits , it seems that the individual particle in question should be making a cyclotron orbit . on the other hand since",
    "the whole plasma is supposed to be making a circular kepler orbit around the central object , then presumably this cyclotron - orbiting particle must also be making a kepler orbit around the central object .",
    "a kepler - orbiting cyclotron orbit is not an obvious concept to visualize , at least to this author .",
    "this conceptual difficulty suggests that instead of assuming that a particle is simultaneously kepler - orbiting and cyclotron orbiting , one should go back to first principles to investigate how kepler and cyclotron orbits relate to each other .",
    "perhaps it will then become obvious how to visualize a kepler - cyclotron orbiting particle , or perhaps not .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of kepler orbits .",
    "a particle @xmath2 with conserved angular momentum @xmath3 has radial motion in the kepler effective  potential @xcite@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of a central object .",
    "particles with energies at @xmath6 have circular trajectories with @xmath7 , velocity @xmath8 and constant angular velocity @xmath9 whereas particles with energy exceeding @xmath6 have elliptical trajectories and variable angular velocity @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to kepler dynamics @xcite , basic plasma theory @xcite shows that the guiding center of  a  charged particle in combined magnetic and gravitational fields , but _ no _ electric field ,  drifts at the velocity@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gravitational acceleration . for a mass @xmath5 central object , @xmath13and so the guiding center drift in the @xmath14 plane is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "it is seen that @xmath17 is _ smaller _ than the kepler velocity @xmath18 by @xmath19 an enormous ratio for electrons and ions since @xmath20and @xmath21 are many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath22for typical field strengths .",
    "if all the particles move at a much slower velocity than the kepler velocity , then how could the center of mass move at the kepler velocity ?",
    "furthermore , the @xmath23 add up to give the azimuthal current @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the gravitational drift current results mainly from heavy particle motion @xcite and gravity is _ _ balanced _ _ by the magnetic force ( i.e. , @xmath26 @xcite)@xmath27 rather than by centrifugal force which is insignificant for this example .",
    "the ideal mhd  ohm s law @xmath28 actually fails here , because the hall term @xmath29 in the zero - pressure , generalized @xcite ohm s law @xmath30 can not be dropped since @xmath31 nearly equals the center of mass velocity @xmath32    what sort of trajectory does an actual charged particle follow in an astrophysical situation ?",
    "is it the kepler orbit assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite or the much slower gravitational drift derived in ref .",
    "we show here that even though charged particles in a strong magnetic field can rotate at @xmath18 as assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the motion is not governed by eq.[kepler effective potential ] so charged particles ( and hence a plasma )  do not in general obey kepler dynamics .",
    "this analysis leads to the realization that dust grains having a critical charge to mass ratio spiral in towards the central object and so could provide a gravitationally powered dynamo suitable for driving astrophysical jets .",
    "we consider the axisymmetric charged particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the poloidal flux and is related to the magnetic field by @xmath35 @xmath36 is the electrostatic potential , and we note that ideal mhd ultimately comes from approximations based on eq.[hamiltonian ] and not eq.[kepler effective potential ] . because of axisymmetry the particle s canonical angular momentum @xmath37 is invariant @xcite",
    ". equation [ hamiltonian ] is equivalent to the equation of motion @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we examine solutions to eq.[single particle motion ] in the @xmath14 plane for various charge to mass ratios , a uniform magnetic field @xmath40 and two representative @xmath41 profiles . in order to see the connection between the sense of particle injection and the magnetic field direction , the coordinate system definition we use here is such that positive @xmath42 is determined by the direction of injection of the particle , i.e. , the particle always has initial positive @xmath43 by assumption .",
    "this definition means that @xmath44 could be positive or negative since the direction of the @xmath45 axis is determined by the sense of particle injection ( i.e. , we are defining the @xmath45 axis so that the particle is always injected in the counterclockwise direction ) and not by the direction of @xmath46 .",
    "because @xmath44 can be positive or negative , @xmath47 will have the usual signage for @xmath48 but will have opposite polarity from convention if @xmath49 to see whether or not particles make kepler orbits we track particles starting with the same kinetic energy and @xmath50as a neutral particle undergoing an elliptical kepler orbit .",
    "@xmath51 is defined to be the radius of the initial location and the @xmath52 axis lies in the direction from the central object to this location .",
    "@xmath50 is conserved if @xmath53 but if @xmath54 then @xmath55 rather than @xmath56 is the conserved quantity @xcite@xmath57 @xmath58 will be assumed ( to be justified later ) .",
    "time is normalized to the kepler frequency of a neutral particle undergoing circular motion at @xmath59 , i.e. , to @xmath60 and distances are normalized to @xmath61  the dimensionless variables are then @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 , @xmath67 and using @xmath68 @xmath69 the dimensionless @xmath70 plane hamiltonian is thus@xmath71    rotation of a plasma in a magnetic field polarizes the plasma radially and the resulting @xmath72 corresponds to the voltage to which the plasma capacitor is charged @xcite .",
    "there is thus no natural @xmath73 profile and hence no natural rotational velocity ( e.g. , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we consider two representative cases , namely ( i )  @xmath74 and ( ii ) @xmath75 case ( i ) corresponds to eq.[vg ] while case ( ii ) corresponds to the ` kepler ' equilibria assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite . a third possibility , not discussed here",
    "( see ref.@xcite instead ) ,  sets @xmath72 to give a rotation velocity equal to that of the central object ( so - called co - rotational velocity ) .",
    "we consider all possible values of @xmath76 namely @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79with @xmath80 either positive or negative .",
    "@xmath81 is typical for electrons , ions , and large charge to mass ratio dust grains , whereas @xmath82 corresponds to dust grains with very small charge to mass ratios or macroscopic charged particles such as spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the voltage @xmath83 to which a dust grain becomes charged depends on the charging mechanism and the dust grain size ; @xmath83 typically lies in the range @xmath84 volt @xmath85 volts .",
    "since the dust grain charge is @xmath86 , the charge to mass ratio @xmath87 lies in the range @xmath88 c / kg for typical dust grain radii @xmath89 @xmath90 m @xmath91 @xmath90 m and typical dust grain intrinsic mass density @xmath92 kg m@xmath93 the dust grain @xmath94 ratio is thus 9 - 15 orders of magnitude smaller than that of an electron and 6 - 12 orders of magnitude smaller than that of an ion .",
    "the last two terms in eq.[norm h ] can be written as a normalized effective potential @xmath95 if @xmath96 then @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 in which case @xmath100kepler dynamics @xcite is retrieved .    however , when @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath100and @xmath72 is arbitrary , the dynamics is non - keplerian and eq .",
    "[ chi ] has minima when@xmath102 by using eq.[pphi norm ] , eq.[min chi ] can be recast as @xmath103 so a particle with @xmath104 equal to the effective potential minimum has an angular velocity@xmath105    figure 1 plots @xmath106 and numerically calculated @xmath52-@xmath107 plane trajectories for a range of @xmath80 values and for the two @xmath72 cases . in all trajectory",
    "calculations the particle initial position is @xmath108 and the initial velocity is @xmath109 @xmath110(i.e . , particles start at the same position with the same initial velocity and the same initial mechanical angular momentum @xmath56 ) .",
    "the trajectories are calculated from @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( i.e. , two circular kepler orbit periods ) and the energy @xmath104 is shown as a dashed line in the effective potential plots . an @xmath113 reference circle ( dashed )  is  shown in the trajectory plots .",
    "figure 1 shows that the trajectory depends strongly on both the @xmath114 profile and on @xmath115 the @xmath116 situation ( fifth row of fig .",
    "1 ) is a classic elliptical kepler orbit as prescribed by eq.[kepler effective potential ] and is independent of @xmath72 because a neutral particle is insensitive to electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , when @xmath80 is finite , fig .",
    "1 shows that the effective potential and trajectories differ qualitatively from the classic neutral particle effective potential and elliptical kepler orbit .",
    "it is therefore incorrect to characterize a plasma composed of particles with @xmath117 as being in a kepler orbit ( as done in the mri  and uid models ) because particles in such a plasma are not governed by eq.[kepler effective potential ] and , for example , do not make elliptical orbits with the central object at one focus of the ellipse ( such orbits are the hallmark  of kepler dynamics ) .",
    "insight into the orbits shown in fig .",
    "1 can be obtained by examining solutions to eq.[quadratic ] . for @xmath118  and @xmath119 eq.[quadratic ]",
    "has the roots @xmath120 so heavy charged dust grains with @xmath121 equal to the minimum of the effective potential make circular orbits with a small @xmath122 correction to the kepler frequency",
    ". heavy charged dust grains with @xmath104 slightly above this minimum will make precessing elliptical kepler orbits having small @xmath123 corrections  ( see @xmath124 cases in fig . 1 ) and these corrections will increase with the charge to mass ratio .",
    "for @xmath125 and @xmath126 the two roots of eq.[quadratic ] are @xmath127 the first root corresponds  to a so - called axis - encircling cyclotron orbit @xcite ; this root is not likely to be physically realizable in astrophysical situations since its corresponding azimuthal velocity exceeds the kepler velocity by the large ratio @xmath128 .",
    "normal cyclotron orbits correspond to a particle oscillating @xcite in @xmath129 about a local minimum of @xmath130 and are associated with the second root in eq.[drift solution ] .",
    "the second root is just @xmath17 prescribed by eq.[vg ] @xcite and , as discussed above , is _ smaller _ than @xmath131 by the factor @xmath132 . in reality",
    "@xmath133 would be so enormous that electrons and ions would have negligible azimuthal displacement during one kepler period of a neutral particle .",
    "these slow drift orbits are shown in the top and bottom rows of case ( i ) in fig.1 . in accordance with eq.[vg ] heavy particles drift faster , negative and positive particles drift in opposite directions , and the drift velocity decreases as @xmath44 increases",
    ".    for case ( ii ) , @xmath134 , and so eq.[quad 0 ] becomes@xmath135 where one root is the circular kepler - like orbit @xmath136 with @xmath137 although the @xmath138 root looks superficially like a neutral particle kepler orbit , the orbits are not elliptical , but nearly circular and , as in tokamaks and spheromaks , stay within a poloidal larmor orbit of a constant @xmath139 surface @xcite .",
    "the effective potential minimum has the same radial location as eq.[kepler effective potential ] but the profile is an extremely narrow trough with a large vertical offset ( positive or negative , depending on the charge polarity ) , not a shallow broad well as for eq.[kepler effective potential ] .",
    "a strange behavior is evident in the @xmath140 row of fig .",
    "1 : the effective potential goes to minus infinity on the left and the particle spirals inwards toward the origin in the @xmath52-@xmath107 trajectory plots .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath141and is unlikely for electrons or ions because they typically have @xmath142 however , @xmath143 could occur for dust grains because , being heavy , dust grains have @xmath144 many orders of magnitude smaller than electrons or ions . as seen from eq.[pphi norm ] ,  @xmath145 occurs if @xmath146 or , in un - normalized quantities @xmath143 occurs when @xmath147 in which case @xmath43 also becomes invariant .",
    "in this situation the normalized effective potential , eq.[chi ] , reduces to @xmath148 which has the remarkable feature that no centrifugal repulsion exists so the particle always falls towards @xmath149 with constant @xmath150 ( i.e. , it spirals in ) .",
    "this differs qualitatively from @xmath151 particles which are constrained to orbit at a fixed average radius .",
    "the normalized radial force acting on a @xmath145 particle is @xmath152 which is negative for any potential having @xmath153 .",
    "thus @xmath154 is negative for both the @xmath98 and the ` kepler ' potential @xmath155 if there is a distribution of dust grain sizes , then a corresponding distribution of @xmath80 values will develop and some subset will have @xmath156 .",
    "the situation @xmath156 could occur for negatively charged dust grains injected with @xmath48 or for positively charged dust grains with @xmath49 this latter case is the likely one and if one were to adopt the common convention that the @xmath45 axis is defined by the direction of @xmath157 , this would correspond to retrograde injection .",
    "dust grains accreting to a circumstellar disk will typically absorb stellar uv  photons @xcite and become positively charged by emitting photo - electrons @xcite . some of these dust grains will satisfy @xmath147 if @xmath158 and",
    "so have @xmath159 these dust grains have mechanical angular momentum @xmath3 at the instant before becoming charged by photo - emitting electrons , i.e. , they have mechanical angular momentum @xmath160 at the instant before they become charged .",
    "since neither @xmath129 nor @xmath43 is changed at the instant of charging , their canonical angular momentum @xmath161 becomes zero at the instant after charging .",
    "the infalling @xmath145 dust grains will accumulate at small @xmath162and create a positive space charge there .",
    "the photo - emitted electrons , stranded at large @xmath163 ( since electrons have @xmath164 ) , will create a corresponding negative space charge at large @xmath165 the positive and negative space charges will tend to cancel any polarization charge , e.g. , the polarization charge associated with an initial @xmath166 potential .",
    "accumulation of infalling @xmath145 positive dust grains will eventually create an outward radial electric field @xmath167",
    "( i.e. , opposite direction to that associated with the @xmath134 potential ) .",
    "this accumulation @xmath100 will cease when @xmath167 becomes sufficiently large to create a force @xmath168 which cancels @xmath169 in un - normalized variables this cancellation occurs when @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the potential profile that would exist due to particles other than the accumulating @xmath143 dust grains .",
    "the inward falling @xmath143 dust grains constitute a radially inward conduction current so @xmath172 is negative and the system converts gravitational potential energy into available electrical power ; i.e. , it is a dynamo .",
    "the positive voltage near @xmath173 will drive bipolar axial electric  currents @xmath174 outwards from the @xmath14 plane .",
    "these currents will deplete the positive space charge which will result in a net force @xmath175 that will drive additional @xmath145 dust grains towards @xmath173 where they will replenish the positive space charge .",
    "thus , the system continuously converts the gravitational potential energy of the @xmath143 accreting dust grains into a battery - like electrostatic potential which drives the poloidal current of an astrophysical jet .",
    "the jet itself is accelerated by the @xmath176 force @xcite associated with the axial non - uniformity of the jet poloidal current @xmath177 since @xmath178 the anti - symmetry of @xmath174 with respect to @xmath45 means that @xmath179 at @xmath14 consistent with the assumption made earlier .      the assumption used in this paper that @xmath44 is spatially uniform is a simplifying idealization that enables the analysis to be both brief and focussed on the distinction between kepler and charged particle orbits .",
    "however , an actual accretion disk will almost certainly have @xmath44 depend on both @xmath129 and on @xmath45 so in order to satisfy @xmath180 there will also have to be a @xmath181 this indicates that the axisymmetric magnetic field would be best described using a poloidal flux function @xmath182 i.e. , @xmath183 this more general description of the magnetic field has been used in ref.@xcite , a much lengthier analysis , where three dimensional particle orbits in an approximately self - consistent magnetic field are considered using a generalization of the hamiltonian method presented here .",
    "specifically , the poloidal flux function @xmath182 in ref.@xcite results from a toroidal current due to toroidal motion of charged particles and particles are not restricted to the @xmath14 plane as in the present paper .",
    "the dust grains might be so densely packed as to be optically thick in which case photons from the central object would not reach the dust and the dust would not become charged ; this would constitute a so - called ` dead - zone ' .",
    "the condition for a dust cloud to be optically thick is @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the dust density , @xmath2 is the dust cross - section , and @xmath186 is the characteristic length scale of the dust cloud .",
    "however , the condition for a dust cloud to be collisional is also @xmath184 and so dust grains in an optically thick cloud would be collisional .",
    "this collisional , optically thick state would likely be transient , because collisions are expected to cause coagulation of the dust grains @xcite in which case their radius @xmath187 will increase . since the mass of an individual dust grain is @xmath188 and since coagulation does not change the total mass @xmath5 of all the dust grains , the number @xmath189 of dust grains and hence the density @xmath190 of dust grains scales as @xmath191 because the dust grain cross - section @xmath2 scales as @xmath192 , the product @xmath193scales as @xmath194and so @xmath195 decreases as a result of coagulation .",
    "coagulation of dust grains will thus reduce @xmath195 until @xmath196 becomes less than unity in which case the dust cloud will become collisionless and optically thin . at this point dust would become charged ( ionized ) via photo emission and commence the collisionless trajectories discussed here .",
    "the dead zones would thus disappear as a result of coagulation .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite discusses several other issues including :  the charging rate of dust grains ( i.e. , effective ionization rate of dust grains ) , collisions of dust grains with gas and other dust grains , and the topological properties of astrophysical jets .",
    "these various issues are used to define a parameter space for astrophysical jets powered by the gravitational energy  released by accreting @xmath143 dust grains@xmath57 a self - consistent set of parameters is given for the example of the circumstellar accretion disk of a young stellar object ( yso ) ."
