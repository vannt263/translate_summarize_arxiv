    "those reorientation transitions can occur from out - of - plane to in - plane or vice versa for increasing film thickness @xmath1@xcite , temperature @xmath2 @xcite , or external field @xmath3 .",

    "they found good agreement in the case of applied external field in the easy direction ( here @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "however , their gft fails for external field applied in arbitrary direction , especially in the hard direction ( within the film plane ) . as shown in ref .   for getting closer to the qmc results for magnetic field induced reorientation from out - of - plane to in - plane a more careful treatment of the local anisotropy terms",

    "a decoupling scheme was presented which yields excellent agreement with qmc results for out - of - plane systems .",
    "+ the availability of theories such as gft and their check against state - of - the - art numerical algorithms is highly desirable because of the size limitations of systems where qmc can be performed . on the other hand",
    "the extension of gft from a monolayer ( where it can be compared to qmc as in the the present work ) to multilayer systems is a straightforward task without further approximations@xcite .",
    "+ up to now , to our knowledge , there is no comparison between qmc and approximative theories for easy - plane systems and it is not obvious that the theory presented in refs .",
    "can reproduce the qmc results for in - plane systems as accurately as for the out - of - plane case .",
    "in contrast to the easy - axis case where a certain direction is preferred by the single ion anisotropy in easy - plane systems the full xy - plane is favored and no particular direction is distinguished within the plane .",
    "a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane does not destroy the @xmath6-symmetry .",
    "+ for systems exhibiting this kind of symmetry it was shown in a classical treatment that for external fields smaller than a critical field @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) stable vortices , i.e. a non - collinear arrangement of spins , can exist@xcite .",
    "these vortices can undergo a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition@xcite . depending on the strength of the anisotropy @xmath9",
    "there might be vortices with or without a finite z - component of magnetization@xcite .",
    "in the small anisotropy case ( which is considered in this work , @xmath10 ) there is a finite out - of - plane component and for zero field the two possible directions of magnetization ( @xmath11 ) are energetically degenerate . for increasing magnetic field in z - direction",
    "the vortices antiparallel to the field become more and more unstable ( heavy vortices ) .",
    "however the so called light vortices ( parallel to the field ) are stable up to a critical field @xmath12 and contribute a finite @xmath5-component to the net - magnetization of the considered system @xcite . +",
    "the vortices in connection with a finite z - component of the net - magnetization emerge because of two reasons : first the competition between the anisotropy ( favoring a orientation of the magnetization within the @xmath6-plane ) and the external field ( favoring a perpendicular magnetization ) , and second : the @xmath6-symmetry of the system , which does not allow for a rotated homogeneous phase .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate both aspects , i.e. the field vs. anisotropy competition as well as the symmetry properties in detail for a _ quantum mechanical _ system .",
    "we will compare the results of qmc and gft calculations . +",
    "as explained in more detail below , the qmc algorithm used here allows only for an external field applied in @xmath5-direction .",
    "thus the @xmath6-symmetry can not be broken and no comparison between @xmath6-symmetric and asymmetric systems is possible .",
    "we will use gft to clarify the influence of this symmetry breaking on the homogeneous phase .",
    "on the other hand , the gft used here is by ansatz limited to the homogeneous phase .",
    "therefore it can not describe a non - collinear ( e.g , vortex- ) magnetic phase , which is expected for @xmath8 and small field strengths . the breakdown of magnetization in gft as well as an exposed maximum in the magnetization in qmc at certain critical values of the external field or temperature gives , however , a clear fingerprint of non - collinear configurations , at least if there is no meta - stable homogeneous phase . below these critical values",
    "there will be a finite @xmath5-component in qmc _ and _ a vanishing magnetization in gft .",
    "+ for parameters , where both theories are applicable , qmc serves as a test for the approximations needed in gft .",
    "+   + in this work we find indications for non - collinear spin configurations below a critical field or temperature for @xmath8 by comparing results of qmc and gft as explained in the last clause .",
    "above the critical field we obtain good agreement between qmc and gft results . breaking the @xmath6-symmetry by adding a small @xmath13-component to the external field yields a stable collinear solution in gft .",
    "the @xmath5-component of the magnetization in this case is in good agreement with the qmc results calculated with untilted field .",
    "thus we can conclude that except for the restriction to collinear magnetic states gft describes the competition between external field and anisotropy quite well . +   +",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we explain the basics of the gft and the qmc calculations .",
    "then we apply both approaches to easy - plane systems in external magnetic fields and report the results of our calculations .",
    "in the following we present our theoretical approach using green function theory .",
    "the focus of this work lies on the translational invariant system of a two - dimensional monolayer .",
    "therefore the following hamiltonian is used : @xmath14 the first term describes the heisenberg coupling @xmath15 between spins @xmath16 and @xmath17 located at sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the second term contains an external magnetic field @xmath20 in arbitrary direction ( the land@xmath21 factor @xmath22 and the bohr magneton @xmath23 are absorbed in @xmath20 ) .",
    "the third term represents second order lattice anisotropy due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath24 is the @xmath5-component of @xmath16 ( the @xmath5-axis of the coordinate system is oriented perpendicular to the film - plane ) .",
    "the lattice anisotropy favours in - plane ( @xmath25 ) or out - of - plane ( @xmath26 ) orientation .",
    "our hamiltonian is similar to that used in refs .   for the investigation of the magnetic anisotropy and the field induced reorientation transition .",
    "to simplify calculations we consider nearest neighbor coupling only @xmath27 the main idea of the special treatment presented in refs .",
    "is that , before any decoupling is applied , the coordinate system @xmath28 is rotated to a new system @xmath29 where the new @xmath30-axis is parallel to the magnetization implying a collinear alignment of all spins within the layer .",
    "then a combination of random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite for the nonlocal terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) ( heisenberg exchange interaction term ) and anderson - callen approximation ( ac)@xcite for the local lattice anisotropy term is applied in the rotated system .",
    "after application of the approximation one gets an _ effective _ anisotropy @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the norm of the magnetization and @xmath33 is the spin quantum number , that we have chosen to be @xmath34 in all our calculations . + as shown in comparison with an exact treatment of the local anisotropy term in ref .",
    "this approximation still holds up to anisotropy strengths @xmath35",
    ". therefore we restrict ourselves in the following to small anisotropies ( @xmath36 ) as found in most real materials . ] . for a magnetic field applied in the @xmath37-plane ( @xmath38 ) our theory",
    "gives a condition for the polar angle @xmath39 of the magnetization : @xmath40 the uniform magnon energies ( @xmath41 ) which dominate the physical behavior of the magnetic system can easily be extracted from the theory @xcite : @xmath42 this result coincides with the spin - wave result @xcite if one replaces @xmath32 by the spin quantum number @xmath33 and @xmath43 by the bare anisotropy constant @xmath9 in eq .",

    "this can be seen by following an argument of bloch@xcite already given in 1930 .",
    "since the spin wave dispersion is @xmath53 in the vicinity of @xmath41 the spin - wave density of states @xmath54 is independent of @xmath55 for a two - dimensional system for @xmath55 close to zero .",
    "the excitation of spin - waves at finite temperature leads to a variation of the magnetization of the order : @xmath56 since the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnet_var ] ) diverges for @xmath57 and exited spin - waves lead to a reduction of the magnetization one can conclude that the magnetization should be zero at finite temperature .",
    "however for an infinitesimally small contribution of the external field parallel to the plane , i.e. @xmath58 , a finite gap in the excitation spectrum at @xmath41 opens .    this can be seen in fig.[magnonnegk ] where the uniform magnon modes @xmath59 are shown for different orientations @xmath60 , where @xmath60 is the polar angle of the external field .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : magnet_var ] ) is now finite and a stable finite magnetization in the collinear phase having a well defined orientation in the @xmath37-plane is possible .",
    "+ let us now come back to the case where the applied field is aligned in @xmath5-direction .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ekeffbz ] ) that for external field @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) larger than a critical field @xmath61 given by : @xmath62 a stable collinear solution exists .",
    "since @xmath63 is a decreasing function of temperature @xmath2 a transition from non - collinear to collinear phase with increasing temperature is possible . in fig .",

    "is sufficiently reduced such that @xmath68 , and the collinear phase becomes stable . before we come to the results let us briefly sketch the main aspects of the qmc .      in the last section we gave a short description of the theory used to treat a system described by a hamiltonian of form ( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "this theory applies to the thermodynamic limit ( films of infinte size ) but contains certain approximations .",

    "+ in fact it is impossible to evaluate all operator strings in ( [ partfin ] ) .",
    "the sse - qmc replaces such an evaluation therefore by importance sampling over the strings according to their relative weight .",
    "hence an efficient scheme for generating new operator strings is needed . in the directed loop version of the sse",
    "this is done by dividing the update into two parts . in a first step a diagonal update",
    "is performed by traversing the operator string and replacing some unity operators by diagonal bond operators and vice versa ( the probabilities for both substitutions have to fulfill the detailed balance criterion ) .",
    "then the loop update follows in which new non - diagonal bond operators can appear in the operator string . for details of the update procedure",

    "on the one side the effective anisotropy acts against the external field ( @xmath116 , ( @xmath8 ) ) . the effective anisotropy @xmath63 is reduced with increasing temperature @xmath2 and thus the effective field @xmath117 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "this effect tends to enhance the magnetization with @xmath2 . on the other side thermal fluctuations",

    "the flattening of the magnetization curve near @xmath114 is a result of this competition . for low temperatures @xmath118 the effective anisotropy in the gft",
    "can not be overcome by the external field ( @xmath119 , ( @xmath8 ) ) .",
    "therefore the collinear magnetization in our approximation vanishes due to the mentioned gapless excitations , in contrast to qmc which yields again a finite magnetization because non - collinear states are taken into account as discussed above .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath5-component of magnetization in qmc below @xmath114 can be pictured classically as the spins being in a non - collinear phase with an angle @xmath39 with respect to the @xmath5-axis . since in general anisotropy effects ( which favor in - plane magnetization )",
