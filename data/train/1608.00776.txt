    "in this appendix , first , we present analytic solution of the transition point and the condition that a hpt occurs in the swir model . then we present numerical results of the size and the lifetime distributions of critical branching ( cb ) trees generated on er networks away from a transition point and fully - connected networks .",
    "we also obtain the scaling behaviors for the generations of infected nodes and weakened nodes and their differences for the reaction @xmath53 .",
    "finally schematic figures are provided to illustrate the cascading dynamic processes of @xmath0-core percolation and mutually connected components of interdependent networks in the view of branching processes .      in an absorbing state ,",
    "each node is in one of three states , the susceptible s , weakened w and recovered r states .",
    "we consider the probability @xmath68 that a randomly selected node is in state s when it contacts @xmath69 neighbors in state r. this probability means that the node remains in state s even though it has been in contact @xmath69 times with those @xmath69 neighbors in state i before they change their states to r. thus we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71(@xmath72 ) is the reaction probability of s becoming i(w ) by single attack .",
    "next , @xmath73 is similarly defined as the probability that a randomly selected node is in state w after it contacts @xmath69 neighbors in state i before they change their states to r. the probability @xmath74 is given as @xmath75 where @xmath17 is the probability of w becoming i by single contact with neighboring i. finally , @xmath76 is the probability that a node is in state r when it contacts @xmath69 neighbors in state r in the absorbing state . using the relation @xmath77 , one can determine @xmath76 in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath80 that a randomly chosen node is in state r after the system falls into an absorbing state is given as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the probability that a node has degree @xmath0 and @xmath83 is the probability that an arbitrarily chosen edge leads to a node in state r in the absorbing state .",
    "using the local tree approximation , we define @xmath84 similarly to @xmath83 but now at the tree level @xmath12 .",
    "the probability @xmath85 can be derived from @xmath84 as follows : @xmath86 where the factor @xmath87 is the probability that a node connected to a randomly chosen edge has degree @xmath0 . as a particular case ,",
    "when the network is an er network having a degree distribution that follows the poisson distribution , i.e. , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mean degree , the function @xmath90 is reduced as follows : @xmath91    eq .  ( [ eq : sce ] ) reduces to a self - consistency equation for @xmath83 for a given reaction rate @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 .",

    ", however , @xmath80 becomes equivalent to @xmath83 so that the solution of the self - consistency equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce ] ) yields the order parameter .",
    "thus we define @xmath94 so that the order parameter satisfies the following equation @xmath95      we remark that although non - trivial solutions exist for appropriate values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , some of them might be physically irrelevant for a given initial condition",

    "if @xmath114 , the trivial solution @xmath100 becomes stable so that other non - trivial solutions can not be accessible . on the other hand , since @xmath115 is always negative , the condition @xmath116 guarantees the existence of a non - trivial solution that is stable and physically accessible .",
    "this shows @xmath117 at the transition point which implies @xmath118 .",
    "the solution of @xmath101 within the order of @xmath119 is @xmath120 when a discontinuous phase transition occurs at @xmath117 , i.e. , at @xmath121 , @xmath122 is still positive . since @xmath123 at @xmath124 the condition that a discontinuous transition occurs becomes @xmath125 , which turns out to be @xmath126      here we check if the scaling features of @xmath39 and @xmath2 for the size and the lifetime , respectively , of a cb tree at a transition point @xmath38 are valid even for any @xmath127 .",

    "<S> examples include @xmath0-core percolation  @xcite , and the cascading failure ( cf ) model on interdependent networks  @xcite . in those systems , as nodes or links are removed one by one above the transition point , the order parameter decreases continuously , approaches a nonzero value in a scaling manner at the transition point , where it finally drops to zero : a hpt occurs . </S>",
    "<S> is there a universal mechanism behind this phenomenon ? can it be formulated in terms of branching processes ? </S>",
    "<S> even though these questions are simple and fundamental , there has been no clear answer yet .    in a recent publication  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we showed on the example of the cf model that there are two kinds of critical phenomena related to the hpt . </S>",

    "<S> the occurrence of an infinite avalanche is a distinct feature of a hpt ; it is absent for a second - order percolation transition . </S>",

    "<S> the order parameter decreases rapidly in the early time regime , exhibits a plateau for a long time in the intermediate time regime , and decreases rapidly in the late time regime . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors have been obtained in @xmath0-core percolation  @xcite and in the cf model  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath61 large number of nodes get their degrees reduced to @xmath0 so that they become @xmath7-nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the sc process is again driven by the meeting of an old @xmath7 node with a new @xmath5 node , @xmath37 which in this case means the contact of a @xmath0-degree node with one having degree less than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such a reaction sets up the rapid sc process .    _ the cf model on interdependent networks:_@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> we consider here er interdependent networks in the single layer representation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where we have a single er graph but with two types of links ( a and b ) , for each having the average degree @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> following similar steps we have taken for @xmath0-core percolation , we start the dynamics with a particular configuration at @xmath38 in which each node has at least one link connected to a giant cluster for each type of links , so that it belongs to the giant mcc . in addition , we identify a node @xmath57 such that its deletion leads to an infinite avalanche , i.e. , to the elimination of the entire giant mcc . for each type of links </S>",
    "<S> , we define the critical degrees of a certain node as the number of links connecting to the nodes that belong to the giant mcc  @xcite ( see appendix for details ) , which are denoted as @xmath62 or @xmath63 , respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> otherwise , the node @xmath65 is regarded as a weakened node with state @xmath66 in analogy with the @xmath0-core percolation . when the seed is deleted , the susceptible node at the first generation becomes deleted ( infected ) and its state is denoted as @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical degrees of the weakened nodes are decreased . </S>",
    "<S> when at least one of the reduced critical degrees is unity , the state of the node @xmath65 becomes w. the node in state w becomes infectious when it contacts a corresponding infectious node sometime later . </S>",

    "<S> we find that a cb process induced by the deletion of a critical node persists . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern follows the one previously observed for the swir and the @xmath0-core percolation models .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_:@xmath3 we have investigated dynamical processes of infinite avalanches for hpts occurring on er networks from the perspective of branching processes . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that during the infinite avalanche processes , the order parameter sustains up to @xmath2 , and w - state nodes in the swir model are accumulated to an extent of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> after these cb processes , those accumulated w - state nodes change their state to infected state i in the way of sc processes . </S>",
