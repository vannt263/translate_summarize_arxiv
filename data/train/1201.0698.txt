    "the study of sandpile surfaces unifies the field of granular physics @xcite with that of surface growth @xcite , which latter has been the subject of prolonged theoretical analysis .",
    "one of the best known equations in surface growth is the edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite , which has been used across a swathe of fields : from the experimental analysis of the epitaxial growth of thin films @xcite to the theoretical study of anomalous growth exponents in the presence of drift @xcite .",
    "however , its use in the study of sandpile surfaces has been limited by its one - variable formulation , viz .",
    "the response of surface height @xmath2 to the application of stochastic perturbations .",
    "computer simulations of shaken granular packings in three dimensions @xcite and cellular automaton models @xcite suggested that a full description of the dynamics of granular surfaces needed the coupling of granular clusters and flowing ( mobile ) grains .",
    "since the growth and decay of clusters in a given region directly affects the surface height , it was thought appropriate @xcite to couple the surface height @xmath2 , with a variable @xmath1 denoting the density of flowing grains across the surface .",
    "equations were accordingly written down @xcite which embroidered the edwards - wilkinson equation with a variety of ( usually ) nonlinear transfer terms coupling @xmath2 with @xmath1 , reflecting different physical situations such as pouring / shaking a flat / sloping sandpile .",
    "the response to such perturbations could involve , for example , grains leaving their clusters and beginning to flow ( @xmath2 decreasing and @xmath1 increasing at ( @xmath3 ) ) : or a current of flowing grains getting lodged in a dip on the surface ( @xmath1 decreasing and @xmath2 increasing at ( @xmath3 ) ) .",
    "the purpose of the transfer term was to model such exchanges between the two species , and in so doing ensure the conservation of grains .",
    "a lively discussion ensued about the nature of these transfer terms , and many different ones were proposed to match evolving surfaces under different physical conditions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the application of such noisy nonlinear two - species equations was extended to even more diverse situations , ranging from avalanching to ripple and dune formation @xcite .",
    "all of the above approaches were unified by one particular feature : sandpile surfaces exhibited _ simple _ scaling , independent of the length and time scales considered .",
    "however , experiments suggested that _ anomalous _ scaling might arise @xcite , with different exponents characterising short and long lengths / timescales .",
    "in particular , it was suggested that sloping sandpile surfaces might exhibit asymptotic smoothing under tilt @xcite ; simulations suggested that this might be due to the large avalanches released , which ` swept the surface clean ' @xcite .",
    "new coupled equations ( again drawing on the edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite ) were accordingly written down in one dimension , which explicitly investigated the effect of tilting the surface of a sloping sandpile : they showed that although roughening continued to be observed at short length and time scales , sandpiles manifested asymptotic smoothing @xcite .",
    "the presence of bias is crucial to such smoothing , of course  avalanches flow _ down _ , rather than up a sloping sandpile .",
    "it was then natural to ask : what happens in the absence of such a bias , i.e. when a sandpile is _ flat _ on average ?",
    "also , what happens in dimensions higher than one ?",
    "the present paper asks , and then answers , these questions : anomalous scaling is observed once again , but this time around , the crossover is from logarithmic smoothing for short length / time scales to asymptotic _",
    "roughening_.    we now review some pertinent facts . in general , results of even single - species equations in more than one dimension , are hard to obtain analytically .",
    "an exception is the edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite , which can be solved in any space dimensions ( @xmath4 ) : it is critical for @xmath5 , with roughening exponents ( to be defined below ) @xmath6 , where logarithmic scaling is observed @xcite . even in the case of the kpz equation @xcite where an analytical solution exists for @xmath7 @xcite ,",
    "one has to resort to approximate numerical solutions and compare them with conjectures in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we end this introductory section with a recap of scaling laws pertinent to surface growth @xcite . in general ,",
    "power - law scaling is manifested by growing surfaces , so that the interfacial width @xmath8 of an initially flat interface continues to grow as a power of the time @xmath9 until it saturates : at saturation , its width @xmath10 grows with a power of the system size @xmath11 .",
    "thus : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the _ growth exponent _ and @xmath14 is the _",
    "roughness exponent_. these two asymptotic power laws can be combined into a single scaling form , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the _ dynamic exponent _ and @xmath17 an appropriate scaling function .",
    "however , power - law scaling is sometimes replaced by _",
    "logarithmic _ scaling , especially for surfaces at their critical dimensionality @xcite . in such cases",
    ", we have : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a lattice constant . these two asymptotic expressions can be combined into a single scaling form @xcite to give :    @xmath20,}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is an appropriate scaling function .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ equation ] we present and describe our model equations ; our results are presented and analysed in section [ numerical ] .",
    "we discuss our results and make some concluding remarks in section [ discussion ] .",
    "our model equations in ( @xmath0 ) dimensions contain a coupling between @xmath2 , the local height of immobile clusters and @xmath1 , the density of mobile particles ; this is done through a transfer term @xmath22 , as in previous approaches @xcite , and we follow closely the notation used earlier @xcite : @xmath23    the transfer term models exchanges between immobile clusters and flowing grains : the first part is proportional to surface diffusion , while the second part depends on the _ magnitude _ of the local slope at any point .",
    "this term is thus _ symmetric _ with respect to the sign of the slope , and suggests that any deviation from a flat slope results in the conversion of grains from one to the other species . in more detail",
    ":    the first term @xmath24 , models the contribution to surface diffusion made by the ` effective ' surface of flowing grains when there is continuous avalanching ( @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and @xmath9 ) across the sandpile .",
    "the second term @xmath27 represents the spontaneous generation of flowing grains in response to ( any direction of ) tilt .",
    "the term @xmath28 represents the effect of a boundary layer below which the surface dynamics will not penetrate by limiting the release of flowing grains to this cutoff depth .",
    "the introduction of this term can be seen to provide a regulator , so that tilting will only ever be a moderate perturbation .",
    "after a short while when the condition @xmath29 obtains , then the average value of @xmath1 will be given by @xmath30 .",
    "this condition , apart from its physical reasonableness , is essential for numerical simulations , as it ensures that @xmath2 , @xmath1 and their fluctuations remain finite and measurable .",
    "thus @xmath31 plays the role of an experimental / numerical cut off @xcite and the ratio of @xmath32 controls the inherent dynamics .",
    "the effects of shaking a sandpile ( randomising the cluster distributions @xmath2 ) and pouring grains on a sandpile ( randomising the distribution of @xmath1 ) are modelled by the noise terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "these are accordingly chosen to be two independent gaussian white noises , characterised by their widths @xmath35 , @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37",
    "the simulations have been performed by discretizing equation [ h_equation ] and equation [ rho_equation ] , both in space and time . for this purpose",
    "we have implemented multigrid algorithms @xcite on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "since it is critical behaviour that interests us , we have chosen relatively large spatial grids , ( @xmath38 ) ; in order to avoid numerical instabilities , we have chosen relatively small time stpng , @xmath39 .",
    "we have used a regulator function @xmath40 to eliminate numerical divergences from the transfer term @xmath22 as in earlier work @xcite .",
    "this ensures that : @xmath41 we start with the following intuition :    * given the comments made in the introduction , we would expect the unperturbed behaviour of @xmath2 to be logarithmically smooth , since the edwards - wilkinson equations has @xmath42 .",
    "* we would likewise expect critical fluctuations in @xmath1 to be manifest only for @xmath43 , because the mean value of @xmath1 is constrained by the relation @xmath30 ( see above ) .",

    "although we have checked that our results do not depend on system size by checking for systems of size ( @xmath61 ) , we present , for conciseness , only our results for @xmath45 in fig . [ real ] . to begin with , in figure [ real]a , we take @xmath62 ; our findings confirm the intuition that for any ( non - zero ) value of @xmath31 , the @xmath2 species is critical , while @xmath1 has fully non - critical fluctuations .",
    "as soon as we set @xmath63 , keeping @xmath62 , we find  surprisingly  that the critical fluctuations of @xmath1 begin to dominate those of @xmath2 ( figure [ real]b ) . in order to identify the point at which the critical fluctuations of both species become comparable , we fix @xmath64 and tune @xmath54 : the results for this special point are shown in figure [ real]c and @xmath1 reflects the large initial value of @xmath1 used in order to ensure the positivity of @xmath1 throughout ; this however is not expected to affect the long - time scaling behaviour , as our plots confirm ] .",
    "we examine the system size dependence of this special point by analysing systems of size @xmath61 ; the critical behaviour of both species is unchanged if we rescale the values of @xmath31 and @xmath54 with system size .",
    "this rescaling is made explicit in figure [ real]d , which suggests these special values @xmath65 and @xmath66 depend systematically on system size as @xmath67 .    in order to evaluate the critical exponents",
    ", we evaluate the structure factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are related to the interfacial width @xmath58 as follows @xcite : + @xmath70 because of the above relation , the scaling relations equation [ scaling : relation1 ] and equation [ scaling : relation2 ] can be recast as , @xmath71 here , @xmath72 is the saturation time of the interfacial width @xmath8 and the wave vector @xmath73 .",
    "we mention first of all that the critical behavior of the edwards - wilkinson equation in 2d is logarithmic ( @xmath74 ) . in the work of this paper , crossovers to different nontrivial exponents are manifested as a function of different parameters .",
    "in particular , we emphasizes that _ all _ the nontrivial scaling behaviors found here are _ anomalous _ , i.e. shows different scaling for long length and time scales .",
    "we proceed by first evaluating the cases considered in figure [ real ] , corresponding to the physical situation where there is noise in both species ( i.e. @xmath75 ) .",
    "the plots of structure factor for each set of parameter values considered are presented successively , while the exponent values are compiled and tabulated in table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] ( see below ) .",
    "the first case is presented in figure [ mu4nu0 ] , for the parameter values @xmath62 and @xmath76 .",
    "based on figure [ real]a , we would not expect to see nontrivial critical fluctuations for @xmath1 , an expectation borne out by table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] .",
    "physically , this is because the absence of tilt ( @xmath51 ) halts the spontaneous generation of mobile grains in the steady state , when @xmath77 ; the only source of flowing grains is @xmath34 .",
    "the case of @xmath78 is examined in figure [ mu0nu0 ] , where figure [ real]b would lead us to expect that the fluctuations of @xmath1 would dominate those of @xmath2 ; a perusal of table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] confirms that this is the case . in this case , the dynamical equation for @xmath2 can be viewed as a linear edwards - wilkinson equation having an effective diffusion constant of ( @xmath79 ) . the special point ( @xmath80 )",
    "characterises the crossover point where the fluctuations of @xmath1 just begin to become ` dangerous ' , i.e. critical , and of the same order as those of @xmath2 .",
    "the plots of figure [ cri ] which lead to the exponents tabulated in table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] confirm this intuition : both species show nearly comparable asymptotic roughening .",
    "+   +   +    above the special point ( @xmath65 fixed , @xmath81 ) , we would expect that the fluctuations of @xmath1 would dominate those of @xmath2 ( as in the case of figure [ mu0nu0 ] ) ; our results , presented in figure [ mu1nu15 ] , and tabulated in table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] , confirm this .",
    "this can be understood intuitively by realising that for the @xmath1 equation ( and when @xmath1 is finite ) , the term @xmath82 _ can not _ be renormalised away as an addition to an effective diffusion constant , as it can in the case of the @xmath2 equation .",
    "finally , we study the situation when there is only sustained noise in @xmath1 : i.e. @xmath83 after a transient and @xmath84 . from a study of the model equations in one dimension under these conditions @xcite , we would expect that the @xmath2 landscape would freeze up after a transient ( with possibly non - trivial roughening exponents ) , while the @xmath1 landscape would diffuse over this frozen landscape with edwards - wilkinson exponents .",
    "we find indeed ( figure [ sp ] , table [ ta ] and table [ tb ] ) that after a transient , the @xmath2 landscape is frozen , with non - trivial roughening exponents entirely inherited from the transient noise in @xmath2 . at this point , the @xmath1 landscape gets decoupled from the @xmath2 landscape , and shows logarithmic roughening .",
    "species ( @xmath83 after a transient and @xmath84 ) : ( a ) @xmath85 vs @xmath86 plot and ( b ) @xmath87 vs @xmath88 plot .",
    "the coupling parameters used were : @xmath89 but the results hold for arbitrary values.[sp],title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=136 ] species ( @xmath83 after a transient and @xmath84 ) : ( a ) @xmath85 vs @xmath86 plot and ( b ) @xmath87 vs @xmath88 plot .",
    "the coupling parameters used were : @xmath89 but the results hold for arbitrary values.[sp],title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=136 ]     +    before leaving this section , we summarise our findings : except when the tilt term vanishes , the critical fluctuations of @xmath1 dominate those of @xmath2 as long as there is noise in both species @xmath90 .",
    "when , however , @xmath83 after a transient and @xmath84 , the @xmath1 species is logarithmically smooth , while the frozen @xmath2 landscape is characterised by a novel non - trivial roughening exponent , entirely inherited from the transient phase .",
    "the main focus of our paper was the investigation of a two - species model of sandpile dynamics , representing the height profile and the dynamics of granular flow along a flat surface in the presence of perturbations such as shaking and/or pouring .",
    "importantly , no bias exists in this system , so that avalanches of grains can flow in both directions : this is to be contrasted with the downward flow of grains due to the biasing field of gravity , on a sloping sandpile .",
    "given that the latter scenario had led to asymptotic smoothing @xcite , we wanted to investigate the effect of making our exchange terms fully symmetric , to model a flat sandpile surface .",
    "the particular model that we have explored has an exchange term that includes the effect of tilt , as well as that of a finite boundary layer , below which the bulk of the sandpile is protected from the dynamics at the surface . a major difference from the investigation of similar equations in one dimension",
    "@xcite is that _ anomalous _ scaling is obtained in general for the most _ relevant _ species : wherever appropriate , short - wavelength logarithmic smoothing behaviour at small wavelengths crosses over to asymptotic _",
    "roughening_. this is largely due to the action of the tilt term , which in this unbiased case , causes flowing grains to be generated independent of the sign of the local slope : dips and bumps alike accumulate flowing grains , a change from the asymmetric ( biased ) situation considered in @xcite .",
    "we now discuss our results in detail . when @xmath91 , flowing grains are not generated from clusters ; the only source for these is from the ` pouring ' source , @xmath34 .",
    "the form of the transfer term then implies that there is a net transfer from the flowing grains to the clusters , resulting in an enhanced roughness as the couplings become relevant ; the @xmath2 species is then characterised by a crossover from logarithmic smoothing to roughening with the novel exponents presented in the second line of each of tables [ ta ] and [ tb ] , while the @xmath1 species remains logarithmically smooth as expected .",
    "such a simplification also occurs ( sixth line of tables [ ta ] and [ tb ] ) when after a transient period when both noises are present , only @xmath92 remains finite . after a transient period",
    ", the @xmath2 profile is frozen into a state of extreme roughness , fed by the flowing grains ( whose dynamics show the expected ew logarithmic smoothing ) : the large roughening exponent obtained is novel , especially because it is independent of parameter values . finally , for @xmath93 such that @xmath94 , the critical fluctuations of @xmath1 dominate those of @xmath2 , which can be viewed as a state of continuous avalanching , when the effective surface is defined by the film of flowing grains @xcite .",
    "anomalous scaling is again everywhere observed , with a crossover from logarithmic smoothing to asymptotic roughening : this can be given an interpretation in the context of ` thick avalanches ' @xcite , so that the novel roughening exponents we have reported for @xmath1 can be analysed in greater depth with respect to earlier studies @xcite .",
    "they can also be measured using sophisticated visualisation techniques on traditional rotating cylinder experiments , which have been the subject of considerable recent activity @xcite , and which can fruitfully be employed in studies of the kind of surface roughening reported here .",
