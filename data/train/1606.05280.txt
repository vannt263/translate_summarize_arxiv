    ", we derive the sfr density at @xmath238 - 10 ( table  [ tab : sfrdens ] ) . for redshift - independent dust temperatures @xmath222 k , our results point towards lower sfr density estimates at @xmath272 than inferred in the past ( by factors of @xmath42 :",
    "see also capak et al .",
    "nevertheless , if the dust temperature is higher at @xmath272 than @xmath10 k , the inferred sfr density would still be lower ( than previous estimates ) , but not by as much .",
    "the present results also help us to interpret the high h@xmath37-to - uv - continuum luminosity ratios in high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , shim et al .",
    "2011 ) . if dust does not majorly impact the observed h@xmath37 and @xmath14-continuum fluxes from these galaxies , the observed luminosity ratios are close to the intrinsic ones .",
    "star - forming galaxies at @xmath42 would then produce up to @xmath41.8@xmath45 as many ionizing photons per @xmath14 continuum photon , as expected from standard stellar population models .",
    "this would imply that star - forming galaxies can reionize the universe even if the escape fraction is just 8@xmath232% .",
    "in fact , if true , the escape fraction can not be higher than 8% as it would imply a higher ionizing emissivity from galaxies than is observed ( e.g. , mitra et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2015 ) , requiring that the universe finish reionization earlier than @xmath29 ( i.e. , @xmath267 ) .",
    "given the small number of detected sources in our deep - continuum probe and the large uncertainties on the ir luminosities of especially faint sources , the aspecs program represents but a first step .",

    "there have been a large number of different measurements of the infrared excess in galaxies as a function of their stellar mass from @xmath7 to @xmath31 ( e.g. , panella et al .  2009 ; reddy et al .",

    ", we aim to derive a consensus determination of the infrared excess versus apparent stellar mass that provide a reasonable representation of each determination . towards this end , in figure  [ fig : lit ] , we present three significant recent determinations of the infrared excess of @xmath18 - 3 galaxies versus the stellar mass .",
    "the results are presented with the thick light red line and have the form : @xmath225 - 9.17\\ ] ] it is clear from this relationship provides an approximate match to the results from each of the three studies ( if some allowance is made for modest systematics from one study to another ) .",
    "our alma continuum observations allow us to set important constraints on dust emission from @xmath202 galaxies .",
    "however , these constraints depend significantly on the assumptions we make regarding the form of the far - ir seds .    as a sanity check on the present result",
    ", we derive independent estimates of ir luminosities for @xmath88 - 3.0 galaxies in our selection using deep 24@xmath1 m mips observations over goods south .",
    "the apparent luminosity of @xmath18 galaxies in the 24@xmath1 m band , i.e. , rest - frame 8@xmath1 m , is known to be well correlated with the ir luminosity of distant galaxies .",
    "to convert the measured 8@xmath1 m luminosities of sources @xmath273 to the equivalent luminosity in the ir , i.e. , @xmath139 , we use the prescription of reddy et al .",

    "( 2010 ) to be in terms of the ir luminosity instead of the sfr . for lower luminosity sources ,",
    "it is more appropriate to assume that galaxies are less optically thick .",
    "reddy et al .  ( 2010 ) suggest the following prescription in this case : @xmath274 = ( 1.37\\pm0.16)\\log_{10}[l_8/l_{\\odot}]-(3.01\\pm1.34)\\ ] ] the 24@xmath1 m flux measurements we use for sources are from whitaker et al .",

    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : mipsalma ] , and it is clear that there is a good correlation between the mips - derived ir luminosities and the alma - derived luminosities assuming different dust temperatures 35 k , 50 k , and also allowing for a monotonically increasing dust temperature towards high redshift following the results of bethermin et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .    in general ,",
    "the mips - derived ir luminosities we compute are @xmath40.3 dex higher in general than our alma - derived ir luminosities , if we adopt a fiducial dust temperature of 35 k , but agree better with these luminosities if we allow the dust temperature to increase somewhat towards higher redshift or adopt a dust temperature of 50 k. figure  [ fig : mips ] illustrates the generally good correlation between the observed 24@xmath1 m fluxes and the alma 1.2@xmath49 mm fluxes .",
    "unfortunately , all aspects of this comparison are uncertain , from source - to - source variations in @xmath34 ( elbaz et al .  2011 ; genzel et al .  2015 ; da cunha et al .",
    "2015 ) , to the conversion from mips 24@xmath1 m luminosities to ir luminosities , to the extension of these results to fainter , lower - mass @xmath3 - 10 galaxies .",
    "because of these uncertainties , we persist with the 35 k dust temperature preferred as a compromise between different studies and compute ir luminosities using this assumption . in making this assumption",
