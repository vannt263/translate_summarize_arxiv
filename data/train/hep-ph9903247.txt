    "there is a famous upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , _ i.e. _ , which is lighter than z boson at tree level @xcite .",
    "this comes from the fact that the quartic couplings of the neutral higgses are determined by only the weak gauge couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 due to the supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "however , since the top yukawa coupling is large , this tree - level upper bound receives large corrections @xcite .",
    "further , qcd correction , which begins from a two - loop order , is also large @xcite , because the strong gauge coupling @xmath4 first appears at two - loop order , in other words , two - loop is the lowest order in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the upper bound can be set about 130  gev in the mssm when all the squark masses are at order of 1  tev .    here",
    "we will provide the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the supersymmetric standard model with arbitrary number of higgs doublets , which is the minimal extension of the mssm in the meaning that its higgs sector is composed of doublets only .",
    "this model has the same upper bound as the mssm up to one - loop level .",
    "so , we must include at least two - loop corrections to the upper bound in order to see the difference from the mssm .",
    "actually , the two - loop order corrections include the contributions of the extra yukawa couplings , which are characteristic of the multi - higgs - doublet model and can be relatively large .",
    "we demand that the theory remains perturbative up to the scale @xmath0 in order to set the upper bound on the extra yukawa couplings , which are unconstrained experimentally .",
    "then the resulting upper bound @xmath5 depends on the scale @xmath0 , and becomes more stringent as @xmath0 is larger .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath6  gev in the case of @xmath7  gev , which is almost the same as the upper bound in the mssm . on the other hand , for @xmath1  gev , which is one order above the susy - breaking scale @xmath8",
    ", the upper bound is lifted up by 10  gev due to the large extra yukawa couplings . throughout this letter ,",
    "the soft susy - breaking squark masses are assumed to be 1  tev and degenerate for simplicity .",
    "we denote the number of the higgs doublets as @xmath9 .",
    "then the superpotential of this model is written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the superfields of the left - handed quark doublet in the third generation , right - handed top quark and right - handed bottom quark respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the superfields of the higgs doublets .",
    "the ellipsis denotes the terms involving quark superfields in the first and second generations and lepton superfields , which are irrelevant to our result .    with general soft susy - breaking terms ,",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of this model is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the neutral components of the higgs doublets , which couple to the down - type quarks and to the up - type quarks respectively .",
    "the matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath20 hermitian matrices and @xmath21 is generally an @xmath20 complex matrices .",
    "the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the gauge couplings of @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we concentrate our attention only on the neutral higgs fields since only neutral fields may take vevs after the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "now we can rotate the higgs fields so that @xmath24 where prime denotes a quantity after the field transformation .",
    "just like in the mssm case , we regard a diagonal element of the mass squared matrix , @xmath25 , as the desired upper bound . here",
    "the matrix @xmath26 is the mass squared matrix of the neutral higgses , and the field  @xmath27 is the real part of the field  @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 then we can restrict the effective potential to @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions .",
    "@xmath33 this is the same form as the higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "therefore it is a trivial result that the desired tree - level upper bound @xmath5 is the same one as that of the mssm , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "next we consider the one - loop radiative corrections to this tree - level upper bound .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the effective potential mainly come from the loops of quarks and squarks in the third generation because of the large sizes of their yukawa couplings . in the @xmath35 scheme , this is given by @xmath36 ,   \\label{v1lp}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are higgs - field - dependent masses of the squarks and quarks respectively , and defined by @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the row vectors of the yukawa couplings defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the soft susy - breaking @xmath48-parameter matrices , and @xmath49 is the @xmath49-parameter matrix whose @xmath50-component is @xmath51 .",
    "here we assume the soft susy - breaking squark masses to be degenerate and take the common mass @xmath52 .",
    "we also neglect the small @xmath53-term contributions for simplicity , but including these contributions does not change the following discussion .    we should calculate the second derivative of @xmath54 in terms of @xmath27 to obtain the upper bound @xmath5 . in the basis ( [ pbasis ] ) , the effective potential restricted to the directions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 again becomes the same form as that of the mssm .",
    "hence we can easily see that the upper bound @xmath5 is also the same as the one in the mssm case and conclude that @xmath55  gev , which is realized in the case of the large left - right stop mixing .",
    "thus @xmath5 is the same as the one in the mssm up to one - loop order . at two - loop order , however",
    ", the extra yukawa couplings first contribute to @xmath5 as well as the strong gauge coupling  @xmath4 .",
    "then since two - loop order is the lowest order in terms of these couplings and one - loop corrections are the same order as the tree - level value , the two - loop corrections might be relatively large .",
    "in fact , the qcd correction lowers the upper bound by more than 10 gev in the mssm due to the large size of @xmath4 . since the extra yukawa couplings are unconstrained experimentally , we will set their upper bounds by requiring that the theory remains perturbative up to some scale @xmath0 .",
    "the maximal values of the extra yukawa couplings under this requirement might be large , so that the two - loop corrections to @xmath5 due to these couplings are as large as the qcd correction .",
    "so in this letter , the upper bound @xmath5 is calculated using the rge improved effective potential approach in the two - loop leading - log approximation in order to see how different the upper bound @xmath5 is from that of the mssm .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the squarks are degenerate and their masses are 1  tev throughout this letter and neglect @xmath56 contributions . we can obtain the upper bound formula in a quite similar way to ref.@xcite , in which the analytic expression of the lightest higgs mass is provided in two - loop leading - log approximation in the mssm .",

    "the second line of the formula is the part of the one - loop correction , and the rest is the two - loop leading - log contributions .",
    "it is clear from the above expression that the upper bound @xmath5 gives the absolute upper bound when @xmath71 is large and @xmath60 $ ] has its maximal value .",

    "( @xmath79 denotes gluino , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the squarks in the third generation , @xmath83 are higgses and @xmath84 are higgsinos . )",
    "now since we consider below the scale @xmath85 , the maximal value of @xmath58 is @xmath86 which is realized in the limit that all the higgs bosons are lighter than the top quark .",
    "here we rotate in the higgs field space again and make the only one pair of the higgs doublets couple to quarks .",
    "the top and bottom yukawa couplings in this basis are @xmath87 respectively .",
    "( the quantities in this basis are denoted by the double primed ones . )",
    "however , this limit does not coincide with the limit that the lightest mass eigenvalue saturates the upper bound @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , not all the higgses have to be heavy to saturate @xmath5 , but some of them may be relatively light unless they mix with the lightest mass eigenstate . in this case",
    "the scale at which @xmath58 is estimated is not above all of the higgs mass eigenvalues and thus @xmath60 $ ] that should be used in the upper bound formula ( [ upbd - bt ] ) is smaller than the maximal value ( [ btmt - mx ] ) by the contributions of the `` extra '' yukawa couplings corresponding to the `` extra '' higgses that are decoupled .",
    "here we denote the word `` extra '' as the meaning of giving no masses to the quarks .",
    "for example , the extra yukawa couplings mean @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the absolute upper bound is thus realized when all higgses that do not mix with the lightest one are light and the extra yukawa couplings that correspond to heavy extra higgses are small enough so that @xmath58 is close to ( [ btmt - mx ] ) if the fixed values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given .",
    "thus , from now on , we will restrict the parameter space to this region .    unlike the mssm case",
    ", there is no upper bound on @xmath91 and @xmath92 due to the existence of unconstrained coupling constants @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "then we put the requirement :    * `` the theory remains perturbative up to some scale @xmath0 . ''",
    "*    by substituting ( [ btmt - mx ] ) for @xmath60 $ ] in the formula ( [ upbd - bt])and setting @xmath71 large , the desired upper bound is obtained as @xmath96\\right\\},\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 that maximize the combination @xmath99 under the above requirement .",
    "now we will compute @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "first , we should notice that the rges of @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the same as that of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the mssm because @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the sole pair of the yukawa couplings that couple to the up - type quark multiplets and the down - type quark multiplets respectively and the gauge interactions do not mix @xmath100 and @xmath101 with the other higgses .",
    "thus , we can use the formulae in @xcite , which are expressed by the step functions just like ( [ btmt ] ) . here",
    "we will use the rges that is gained by setting all @xmath102 s to one above the susy - breaking scale @xmath8 and all @xmath102 s except @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 to one below the scale @xmath8 at the rge formulae in @xcite .",
    "of course the correct rges below @xmath8 depend on the mass spectrum of the susy particles , but this difference is thought to be small and negligible .",
    "further we will also neglect the @xmath106 yukawa coupling @xmath107 for simplicity .",
    "neglecting @xmath107 does not lower the upper bound @xmath5 because the coefficient of @xmath108 in the rge of @xmath92 is positive .",
    "thus the rges we are using are @xmath109 above @xmath8 and @xmath110 below @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "next we will consider the gauge couplings . by extending the rges in @xcite in the same way as the above yukawa coupling case and solving the rges , we obtain above the scale @xmath8 , @xmath114 and below @xmath8 , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 )",
    "are decided by the initial conditions : @xmath119 and the boundary conditions at @xmath120 .    using ( [ rge - h2pp])-([rge - g1-bl ] ) , @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be computed .    as the criterion that the theory remains perturbative up to @xmath0",
    ", we adopt the condition whether one of the dimensionless coupling constants ( gauge or yukawa ) saturates the scale @xmath0 .",
    "a particular coupling @xmath121 is said to `` saturate '' a scale @xmath0 if @xmath122 for @xmath123 , and the equality in ( [ saturate ] ) holds for @xmath124 .",
    "one can see from the rges ( [ rge - g3])-([rge - g1-bl ] ) and the conditions ( [ in - cd : gauge ] ) that @xmath125 is the first gauge coupling to saturate for every scale @xmath0 .",
    "thus one can not set @xmath0 larger than the scale @xmath126 determined by the saturation of @xmath125 for a given @xmath127 .",
    "however , this constraint does not restrict the allowed region of @xmath0 so strictly .",
    "for example , @xmath128  gev , @xmath129  gev , @xmath130  gev and @xmath131  gev .",
    "the upper bound @xmath132 discussed so far is @xmath133 .",
    "since the effective potential  @xmath134 is a sum of one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) feynman diagrams with zero external momenta , @xmath132 is written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the self - energy of the higgs boson .    on the other hand ,",
    "physical mass @xmath137 is defined as a pole of the propagator , that is , @xmath138    then from ( [ runmh ] ) and ( [ polemh ] ) , the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath137 is @xmath139 more precisely , @xmath140 the imaginary part of @xmath141 contributes to the decay width of the higgs boson , and if we suppose @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the physical mass of the w boson , the higgs is stable at tree level and ( [ run - pole ] ) is correct .",
    "this correction @xmath144 mainly comes from one - loop electroweak interaction effects .",
    "this correction is larger than the mssm case due to the existence of the extra yukawa couplings , but still small and lift up the upper bound @xmath5 by 2  gev at most .",
    "the results including the self - energy contribution is plotted in fig.[md1 ] in the case of @xmath145 .",
    "since we are interested in the absolute upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs , only large @xmath71 case ( @xmath146 ) is plotted .",
    "the lines are the case of @xmath147  gev from bottom to top .",
    "the common soft susy - breaking stop mass parameter @xmath52 is set to be 1  tev in all the cases .",
    "we can see from this figure that setting the saturation scale @xmath0 larger , the upper bound @xmath5 becomes more stringent .    because the rges ( [ rge - h2pp])-([rge - h1pp - bl ] ) have @xmath127-dependence only through the terms involving the weak gauge couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the @xmath127-dependence of @xmath5 is quite small .",
    "in fact , since the @xmath127-dependence of the result becomes larger as @xmath0 is larger and @xmath2 becomes no longer small at @xmath148  gev for @xmath149 ( @xmath130  gev ) , we can see the most enhanced @xmath127-dependence of @xmath5 when we compare the two cases : @xmath145 and @xmath149 for @xmath150  gev .",
    "this situation is plotted in fig.[md2 ] .",
