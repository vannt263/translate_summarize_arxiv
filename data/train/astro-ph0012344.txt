    "we have taken advantage of the extremely high spectral resolution in the vlt - uves data to revisit the spectral features of the symbiotic nova rr tel .",
    "we will consider here some aspects of these new observations , related to fluorescence mechanisms in the oiii lines .",
    "we refer to selvelli and bonifacio ( 2000 ) for a detailed description of the data and their reduction .",
    "it is well known ( see kastner and bahtia ( 1996 ) ( kb ) for a comprehensive paper ) that the excitation of the oiii bowen lines is basically due to a fluorescence mechanism in which the he@xmath0 resonance line at 303.78  , in an accidental near coincidence in wavelength with the 303.80    resonance transition of o@xmath1 , pumps the @xmath2 level of o@xmath1 ( o1 process ) .",
    "additional fluorescent processes might be also present , i.e. , the excitation of the o@xmath3 level due to possible overlap of the exciting he@xmath0 line with the 303.69   resonance transition of o@xmath1 ( o3 process ) , and the ( less probable ) excitation of the @xmath4 level by pumping in the resonance line at 303.46  . also , a charge - exchange mechanism ( ce ) seems at work for some of the lines produced in the decay from the @xmath5 term .",
    "we recall that while some cascade lines are common to all processes , there are individual lines that are `` specific '' , e.g. the 3444    and 3132",
    "   lines come only from the o1 process , the 3430    and 3121    only from o3 , the 3408    and 3115    only from pumping of the 303.46    line , and the 5592.34    line ( mult.5 ) from charge - exchange .",

    "kb have pointed out that a `` complete '' bowen system has not yet been observed because of bad covering in wavelength , scarce spectral resolution , lack of accurate line intensities , lack of overlap between data of various observers , the lack of sufficiently accurate intensities for the weak ce line at 5592  , and for the o3 process primary cascade line at 3121.6    being particularly disturbing .",
    "very recently , pereira , de arajo , and landaberry ( 1999 ) , have presented the results of new observations in the range 3100 - 4100   on eso data with spectral resolution of @xmath12    fwhm , in a study of bowen fluorescence lines for a group of symbiotic stars , including rr tel .",
    "the better resolution has increased the number of lines with adequate measurements and has made possible a comparison of line ratios with the predictions of models .",
    "however , errors in the line ratios of the order of 10 percent or larger ( for the weaker lines ) are still present .",

    "figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , are self - explaining and illustrate the exceptional quality of the data that have allowed the detection and measurement of the `` pure '' lines produced in the various excitation process , including the very weak line at 3408.11    associated with pumping in the 303.46   channel .",

    "we have also included for comparison the intensity of h@xmath11 and of the heii 3203   line .",
    "the two lines at 3759.87   and at 3810.59    are blended with stronger lines ( fevii 3758.92    and ovi(1 ) 3811.35  , respectively ) and their intensity is not given .",
    "the remaining lines are unblended except for the 3405.78    line that is partially affected by the presence of the oiv(3 ) line at 3405.78   .",
    "the high accuracy of the data will allow a detailed comparison with the predictions of theoretical models ( bhatia and kastner ( 1993 ) ( bk ) , froese fischer ( 1984 ) ( ff ) , saraph and seaton ( 1980 ) ( ss ) ) .",
    "we limit ourselves here , following pereira , arajo , and landaberry , to present in table 2 a comparison between the observed and the predicted line ratios for some selected lines .",
    "it is clear from table 2 that the best agreement in the overall ratios is with the froese fisher ( 1994 ) rates .",
