    "the problem of determining the motion of @xmath16 bodies subjected to their mutual gravitational interactions has been a center piece of general relativity from its inception .",
    "work on this started shortly after the introduction of the theory , and in 1938 , a firm formulation of the equations of motion was given by einstein , infeld , and hoffmann @xcite , who provided post - newtonian corrections to the newtonian equations of motion .",
    "higher - order corrections were later added @xcite , and work continues today , with damour , jaranowski & schfer @xcite , de andrade , blanchet & faye @xcite , and pati & will @xcite currently computing corrections of third post - newtonian order . a technical review of this field of research , as of 1987 , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the early history was described by havas @xcite .",
    "while the equations of motion for slowly moving bodies in a weak gravitational field are now very well understood , the same can not be said of the fast motion of a massive body in a strong gravitational field .",
    "the prototypical problem here is to determine the motion of a structureless particle of mass @xmath2 in the gravitational field of a much more massive black hole . while it is known that the motion is geodesic in the limit @xmath17 , the issue is to determine the corrections to geodesic motion that appear when @xmath2 in nonvanishing . an important effect that must be introduced",
    "is the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum to the gravitational radiation emitted by the moving particle ; this is effected by an appropriate radiation - reaction force .",
    "another important effect is a conservative correction to the equations of motion , which disappears when @xmath18 .",
    "schematically , therefore , the equations of motion will take the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the particle s four - velocity in the background of the massive black hole , @xmath21 its acceleration ( the semicolon denotes covariant differentiation in the black - hole metric ) , and @xmath22 is the self - force .",
    "this contains both a conservative and a dissipative ( radiation - reaction ) component , and it scales as @xmath23 in the small - mass limit .",
    "( throughout the paper we work in relativistic units , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 both set equal to unity . )    a useful way to look at eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) is to imagine that the motion is actually geodesic in a spacetime that is not the background spacetime of the massive black hole , but the perturbed spacetime that contains the particle as well .",
    "the geodesic motion in the perturbed spacetime can be expressed as a forced motion in the background spacetime , and this gives rise to eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the implementation of this idea , however , presents some difficulty : if the particle is pointlike , the perturbation diverges at the position of the particle , and the geodesic equation is not defined on the world line .",
    "the perturbation must then be decomposed into a part that is singular but does not influence the motion of the particle , and a smooth remainder that is entirely responsible for the self - force @xcite .",
    "this decomposition requires great care .    in simple situations , the orbital evolution of a particle emitting gravitational waves",
    "can be determined without the involvement of a self - force .",
    "if the black hole is nonrotating , the orbital evolution is determined by energy and angular - momentum balance @xcite : the rate at which the radiation carries energy and angular momentum both to infinity and across the event horizon matches the rate at which orbital energy and angular momentum is lost by the particle .",
    "this information alone is sufficient to solve for the motion , at least when the time scale for orbital evolution is long compared with the orbital period .",
    "if the black hole is rotating , the statement continues to be true provided that the orbit is either equatorial or circular @xcite .",
    "when dealing with generic orbits around a rotating black hole , however , the loss of orbital energy and angular momentum no longer constitutes sufficient information  the rate of change of the `` carter constant '' @xcite must also be determined , and this requires the involvement of a self - force @xcite .",
    "there is a practical necessity for the computation of the gravitational self - force .",
    "solar - mass compact objects in highly eccentric , nonequatorial orbits around rapidly rotating , massive black holes ( in the range between @xmath26 and @xmath27 solar masses ) emit gravitational waves that will be measured by eventual spaceborne interferometric detectors @xcite , which operate in the low - frequency band ( in the range between @xmath28 and 1 hz ) .",
    "one such detector , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite , has been selected as one of three `` cornerstone missions '' in the `` horizon 2000 + '' program of the european space agency . a possible involvement by the national aeronautics and space administration  now appearing likely after the publication of the taylor - mckee decadal survey @xcite , in which lisa is listed as a high - priority , moderate - size mission",
    " would increase the likelihood that this detector will be deployed in the not - too - distant future .",
    "a realistic projection places the launch in the neighborhood of 2010 .",
    "the detailed modeling of these sources of gravitational waves for lisa , to the extent that templates could be provided for data analysis , will require a detailed computation of the orbital evolution .",
    "this , in turn , requires that eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) be evaluated and solved for generic orbits around a kerr black hole . for this",
    "we need a practical way of computing the gravitational self - force .",
    "this issue was taken up recently by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @xcite , who calculated the self - force acting on a point particle of mass @xmath2 moving in an arbitrary background spacetime with metric @xmath29 ; they assume that the metric satisfies the einstein field equations in vacuum .",
    "their calculation is based on a careful analysis of the perturbation field in the vicinity of the particle , the ( gravitational ) perturbation being created by the particle itself .",
    "it involves a careful decomposition of the perturbation into a part that is singular at the particle s location but does not affect its motion , and a part that is well - behaved and governs the motion .",
    "their expression for the self - force was then reproduced by quinn and wald @xcite , on the basis of a different approach involving a comparison between self - forces acting in two different spacetimes .",
    "both teams found the following equations of motion : @xmath30 here , @xmath20 is the particle s four - velocity in the background spacetime , @xmath31 is an external force acting on the particle , and an overdot indicates differentiation with respect to proper time @xmath32 .",
    "the gravitational self - force is given by @xmath33 the four - index object @xmath34 appearing inside the integral is the retarded gravitational green s function @xcite , whose precise definition is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.24 ] ) below ( our normalization differs from the conventional choice by a factor of 4 ) ; the unprimed indices refer to the field point @xmath35 ( which is identified in the integral with the current position of the particle ) , while the primed indices refer to the source point @xmath36 ( identified with the particle s past position ) .",
    "the integral extends over the past world line of the particle , from @xmath37 to ( almost ) the current time , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is very small and positive @xcite .",
    "the integration is cut short to avoid the singular behavior of the green s function as @xmath36 approaches @xmath35 ; it involves only the smooth part of the green s function , which is often referred to as its `` tail part '' @xcite .",
    "in a situation in which the particle is subjected only to its self - force , the equations of motion reduce to @xmath40 . because the self - force scales like @xmath23 , we recover geodesic motion in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "the difficulty of evaluating eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) resides with the computation of the gravitational green s function , which would be very hard to carry out for an arbitrary spacetime .",
    "there is hope for progress , however , if the spacetime possesses symmetries , such as staticity and spherical symmetry in the case of a schwarzschild black hole , or stationarity and axial symmetry in the case of a kerr black hole . in such cases , a plausible method of computation would be based on a separation - of - variables approach , and the _ modes _ of the green s function could be obtained fairly easily @xcite . but this approach is not free of difficulties : while the individual modes of the green s function stay finite and continuous as @xmath35 approaches @xmath36 ( though they are discontinuous in their first derivatives ) , the sum over modes does not converge . essentially , this is because the modes do not distinguish between the singular and smooth parts of the green s function ; they contribute to both , and the singular behavior of the green s function gives rise to a divergent sum .",
    "recently , ori , burko , and barack @xcite have devised a way to regularize the mode sums , so as to extract from them a meaningful expression for the self - force .",
    "they have applied their technique to a number of simple situations involving scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational radiation .",
    "similar regularization methods were proposed by lousto @xcite , as well as nakano , mino , and sasaki @xcite .",
    "it appears likely that in the near future , this method will be used successfully to solve more complicated problems , including the prototypical problem mentioned previously .",
    "the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) by mino _",
    "@xcite , and quinn & wald @xcite , is based on methods previously introduced by dewitt and brehme @xcite .",
    "these authors calculated the self - force acting on an _ electrically charged _",
    "particle moving in an arbitrary spacetime with metric @xmath29 . as corrected by hobbs @xcite ,",
    "the equations of motion of a charged particle are @xmath41 where @xmath1 is the particle s electric charge , @xmath31 an external force acting on the particle , @xmath42 the spacetime s ricci tensor , and @xmath43 is the electromagnetic self - force .",
    "the two - index object @xmath44 is the retarded electromagnetic green s function @xcite , whose precise definition is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.16 ] ) below . in the absence of an external force , and in a region of spacetime empty of matter , the equations of motion reduce to @xmath45 . in flat spacetime , on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath46 because the green s function contains only a singular part ; the smooth , or tail , part vanishes . in",
    "flat spacetime , therefore , we recover the abrahams - lorentz - dirac equation @xcite , @xmath47 the practical computation of the electromagnetic self - force presents the same technical difficulties as in the gravitational case .      the self - force acting on a particle with _",
    "charge @xmath0 was recently calculated by quinn @xcite . in this case , the equations of motion are @xmath48 where the self - force is now given by @xmath49 in which the retarded green s function @xmath50 is a scalar ; this is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) below . in the absence of an external force , the equations of motion reduce to @xmath51 , and this is the simplest realization of the class of equations that govern the orbital evolution of a particle moving in a strong gravitational field .",
    "the computation of the scalar , electromagnetic , or gravitational self - force involves solving for a retarded green s function , and then performing an integration over the particle s past world line . because there is only one component to the scalar green s function ( as opposed to 16 for the electromagnetic function , or 100 for the gravitational case ) , eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) captures the essence of the problem and avoids many technical complications . for this reason",
    ", it has been the starting point of many recent investigations @xcite .",
    "the computation of the various green s functions is a very difficult undertaking even when the spacetime possesses many symmetries .",
    "this is , however , a very tractable task when the spacetime is only weakly curved .",
    "in such a situation , the metric itself can be calculated perturbatively as an expansion about flat spacetime , and the same technique can be employed to find the green s functions and compute the self - forces .",
    "our purpose with this paper is to do just that .",
    "we will consider spacetimes for which the metric can be expressed as @xmath52 in which @xmath53 is a generic newtonian potential satisfying poisson s equation , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mass density .",
    "we will keep @xmath3 unspecified throughout the paper , but assume that it is small everywhere .",
    "we shall also assume that the mass distribution is bounded , so that @xmath3 behaves as @xmath56 at large distances @xmath5 from the center of mass ; @xmath57 is the total mass , and @xmath58 .",
    "various aspects of those spacetimes are discussed in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii and iv we calculate the scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational green s functions to first order in @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "v we use the green s functions to calculate the scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational self - forces .",
    "our motivation for carrying out such a ( long ) computation is to provide a useful check on the formalism , especially in its gravitational formulation . admittedly , the weak - field limit is not by itself very interesting , but understanding this limit may well be a necessary step toward understanding the strong - field behavior of the gravitational self - force .",
    "so while we can not hope to learn anything new from such a weak - field computation , we can use our knowledge of the post - newtonian equations of motion @xcite to produce a nontrivial check of the self - force method ; the results found here should of course match the results from the literature .",
    "as we shall see , we have been successful at producing this check : the method works .",
    "we are not the first to perform such a check on the formalism . in 1964 ,",
    "dewitt and dewitt @xcite calculated the electromagnetic self - force , as given by eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) , for the weakly curved spacetime of eq .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) .",
    "they considered only the special case @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , but noted that their results generalize to arbitrary potentials by superposition .",
    "( we use a bold - faced symbol to denote a three - dimensional vector living in flat space . )",
    "they found that to leading order in a weak - field , slow - motion approximation , the spatial components of the self - force are @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the newtonian gravitational field . in this limit , the equations of motion @xmath64 become @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the trajectory of the charged particle .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) is a repulsive correction to the local force of gravity ; it agrees with the weak - field limit of a result by smith and will @xcite , who calculated the force required to hold a charged particle in place in the ( exact ) field of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the second term is the usual expression for the radiation - reaction force experienced by a charged particle subjected to an external force @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) is remarkable because this entirely local expression for the self - force derives from a nonlocal formulation involving the entire past history of the charged particle ; in the weak - field limit , any trace of nonlocality is lost .",
    "the result is remarkable also because while the expression for the radiation - reaction component of the self - force is the expected @xmath68 , it is very hard to see how such a simple result could ever follow from such a complicated expression as eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "we notice that this result for the radiation - reaction force can be obtained from two very different approaches . in a flat - spacetime point of view , the equations of motion for a charged particle are @xmath69 ; in the slow - motion limit , the external force is @xmath67 , and we recover the usual result . in a curved - spacetime point of view",
    ", on the other hand , there is no external force and the equations of motion are @xmath45 ; in the weak - field , slow - motion limit , we also recover the usual result .",
    "this agreement is necessary on physical grounds , but it could hardly have been anticipated on the basis of a quick inspection of eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) ; the calculations required to produce eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) are very involved .    in their paper @xcite , dewitt and",
    "dewitt gave the following physical picture for the self - force of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) .",
    "this picture relies heavily on their expression for the newtonian potential , @xmath70 , which corresponds to a point mass @xmath6 located at the origin of the coordinate system .    because the fundamental expression for the self - force , eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) , involves only the smooth , or tail , part of the electromagnetic green s function , there is a priori no _",
    "local _ contribution to this force coming from the world - line integral .",
    "indeed , dewitt and dewitt found that the quantity inside this integral vanishes in the immediate past of the event @xmath71 , which corresponds to the particle s current position .",
    "in fact , it vanishes until the time delay , @xmath72 , becomes equal to @xmath73 , the distance between the central mass @xmath6 and the particle s current position @xmath74 , added to the distance to the particle s old position @xmath75 . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the electromagnetic green s function undergoes an abrupt change of behavior , and the self - force is entirely due to this sudden transition .",
    "( we expand our discussion of this point in appendix b. ) the physical effect responsible for the force , in dewitt and dewitt s view @xcite , is a signal that originates from the particle at an earlier time @xmath77 , propagates toward the central mass @xmath6 at the speed of light , bounces off the central mass , and comes back to the particle at the current time @xmath78 . although the self - force is nonlocal , eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) involves the conditions at the current time only .",
    "this is because the time delay in not noticeable at the level of approximation maintained in the calculation . to leading order in a weak - field , slow - motion approximation",
    ", the electromagnetic self - force appears to be entirely local .    the physical picture described in the preceding paragraph appeared to us to be slightly suspicious .",
    "the sudden change in the behavior of the electromagnetic green s function at @xmath76 is dictated by the presence of the point mass @xmath6 at @xmath79 , which mediates the interaction between the charged particle and its earlier self .",
    "the region of spacetime near the central mass is therefore seen to have an important effect on the green s function , and it is this effect  the sudden change  which apparently gives rise to the self - force .",
    "but @xmath80 can not be considered to be small in this region of spacetime , and the perturbative method of calculation of the green s function must come into question . while there is little reason to doubt the validity of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) , it appeared to us that its derivation by dewitt and dewitt @xcite left room for improvement .",
    "part of this paper is concerned with providing a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) that is free of this criticism . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath81 is everywhere much smaller than unity , and reduces to @xmath56 only far away from the mass distribution .",
    "building upon dewitt and dewitt s work @xcite , we introduce ( in secs .",
    "iii and iv ) techniques that allow us to compute the electromagnetic green s function for such generic newtonian potentials . in sec .",
    "v we recalculate the electromagnetic self - force for these potentials , and we reproduce eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) .",
    "while our result is compatible with the physical picture suggested by dewitt and dewitt , our derivation shows very clearly that the result is largely independent of the conditions near the mass distribution .",
    "we consider this improvement on the original derivation to be a significant contribution to this field .",
    "our derivation is also more transparent , in the sense that the computational labor involved is much reduced compared with the original calculations of dewitt and dewitt .",
    "the techniques introduced in secs .",
    "iii and iv allow us to calculate all three types of green s functions  scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational .",
    "those are used in sec .",
    "v to calculate the respective self - forces .",
    "part of the paper is therefore devoted to the calculation of the scalar and gravitational self - forces in the weakly curved spacetimes of eq .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such calculations have not yet been presented in the literature .      the computations are simplest for the case of a scalar charge , and we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath9 is a constant measuring the coupling of the scalar field to the spacetime curvature ; a precise definition is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) below .",
    "the equations of motion for the scalar charge @xmath0 are identical to eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) , but with the scalar self - force replacing the electromagnetic self - force . for minimal coupling ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "the self - force is entirely dissipative , and we recover the expected result , @xmath12 ; this is the radiation - reaction force experienced by a scalar charge subjected to an external force @xmath67 . for minimal coupling , the self - force acting on a stationary charge vanishes ; this agrees with wiseman s result @xcite for the force required to hold a scalar charge in place in the exact field of a schwarzschild black hole . if @xmath84 , the conservative part of the self - force is repulsive . if @xmath85 , it is attractive .",
    "this result for the scalar self - force is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) , and we notice that the highly nonlocal expression of eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) has managed to produce the expected local result .",
    "once more the dual point of view holds : we can adopt a flat - spacetime point of view , set @xmath86 to zero in eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) , and get the correct result by equating the external force to @xmath67 ; or we can adopt a curved - spacetime point of view , set @xmath31 to zero in eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) , and get the correct result by evaluating the world - line integral of eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) .",
    "the computations required for the gravitational self - force are the most involved , but here we also face a serious technical problem . we have stressed the importance of working with a newtonian potential that is _ everywhere _ small .",
    "in fact , the perturbative calculation of the green s function requires that the deviations of the metric @xmath29 with respect to the minkowski values @xmath87 be everywhere small . to accommodate this requirement ,",
    "it is necessary that the spacetime contain matter : all vacuum solutions to the einstein field equations representing an isolated massive object necessarily possess regions of strong curvature .",
    "such strong - field regions would affect the green s function in a way that can not be predicted by a perturbative calculation ; the entire method would fail , even if the green s function were to be evaluated only in the weak - field region of the spacetime .",
    "thus , the global character of the green s function , together with the weak - field limitations of our calculational methods , dictate that we work with spacetimes that contain matter .",
    "the problem resides with the fact that the equations of motion for a massive particle , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) , are restricted to _ vacuum _ spacetimes .",
    "the mino - sasaki - tanaka - quinn - wald equations of motion @xcite are therefore not directly suited to a weak - field calculation .",
    "an extension to spacetimes containing matter must be produced .",
    "we do this in sec .",
    "vi , proceeding in two steps .",
    "first , we incorporate the modifications to the gravitational green s function that come from the presence of ricci - tensor terms in green s equation .",
    "these modifications affect the gravitational self - force , but they do not alter eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) if the particle is restricted to move in a vacuum region of the spacetime .",
    "second , we consider how the presence of matter modifies the equations of motion .",
    "because the background stress - energy tensor @xmath88 depends on the metric , it necessarily suffers a perturbation when the massive particle is inserted in the spacetime .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that while the object of mass @xmath6  the star  is at rest when the particle is absent , it must move in the presence of the particle : both objects move around a fixed center of mass @xcite .",
    "this perturbative motion of the star produces an additional metric perturbation , over and above the perturbation directly associated with the particle s own stress - energy tensor .",
    "this must be accounted for , and we shall see that its effect is to modify the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) by a term @xmath89 which we call the `` matter - mediated '' force . while the self - force can be thought of as a direct action of the particle on itself ,",
    "this additional force can be thought of as an indirect action mediated by the presence of matter : the particle acts on the star , and the star acts back on the particle .",
    "the gravitational self - force is computed in sec .",
    "v , and this calculation incorporates the effects of the matter on the retarded green s function . we obtain @xmath90 and according to the naive equations of motion @xmath91 , the gravitational self - force does work on the particle at an average rate @xmath92 ; it therefore gives rise to radiation _ antidamping _",
    "notice that the self - force represents a correction of 1.5pn ( post - newtonian ) order to the newtonian equations of motion @xcite .",
    "notice also that the dual point of view seems at work also here : our expression for the `` radiation - reaction force '' could be calculated on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) by adopting a `` flat - spacetime point of view '' in which @xmath93 would be set to zero and the `` external force '' equated to @xmath67 .",
    "the remarkable conspiracy that makes the tail integral reproduce the external - force term in the equations of motion is seen to be at play in all three cases . while the agreement between the flat - spacetime and curved - spacetime points of view is quite necessary in the case of the scalar and electromagnetic self - forces , it is decidedly disturbing in the gravitational case .",
    "how can we understand this result ?",
    "the answer obviously comes from the matter - mediated force , which we define and compute in sec .",
    "vi . for this",
    "we obtain @xmath94 where the first term represents the change in the star s newtonian gravitational field associated with its motion around the fixed center of mass , the second term is a post - newtonian correction to the newtonian force @xmath67 , and the third term is a radiation - damping term that precisely cancels out the antidamping force of eq .",
