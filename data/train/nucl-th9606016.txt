    "a very interesting topic in medium energy nuclear physics is the electromagnetic production of mesons on light nuclei in order to study possible changes of the elementary reaction in a nuclear medium .",
    "of particular interest is the reaction on the deuteron for the following reasons .",
    "the first one is that the structure of the deuteron is well understood in comparison to heavier nuclei .",
    "thus , the low binding energy of the deuteron allows to compare the contributions of its constituents to the electromagnetic and hadronic reactions to those from free nucleons in order to estimate off - shell effects .",
    "secondly , the deuteron may be viewed as a neutron target in order to extract under quasifree conditions the elementary neutron amplitude with the tacit assumption that binding and final state interaction effects are small . to assess the validity of this method it is necessary to estimate the effects of mechanisms beyond this approximation quantitatively .",
    "first investigations on pion photoproduction on the deuteron go back to the early fifties , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , with view on the general structure of spin flip and no spin flip amplitudes . later , a more systematic calculation was done by laget @xcite and blomqvist and laget @xcite . in this work the influence of pion rescattering effects and nn final state interaction is approximatly included within a diagrammatic ansatz .",
    "however , they used different @xmath1-parametrizations for neutral and charged pion production .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study pion photoproduction on the deuteron within the spectator nucleon model using a unified elementary production operator .",
    "we have taken the full on - shell amplitude of the elementary process but have neglected all kind of final state interactions and furthermore two - body operators . in view of the extraction of neutron data from experiments on the deuteron",
    "we put our emphasis on the special kinematical situation corresponding to the quasifree pion production on one nucleon .",
    "however , this kinematical condition does not necessarily imply that the pion has been produced on the active nucleon and not on the spectator .",
    "therefore , we have also studied for this kinematical situation the influence of the second nucleon on the differential cross section due to the antisymmetrization of the final nn state .    in sect .",
    "[ kap2 ] , the elementary process of pion photoproduction on the nucleon is briefly reviewed .",
    "the nonresonant amplitudes and the contribution of the @xmath1 resonance are given .",
    "the model for the process on the deuteron is outlined in sect .",
    "finally we present and discuss our results in sect .",
    "we will briefly review pion photoproduction on the nucleon @xmath4 because we need the elementary production amplitude for its implementation into two - nucleon space . in this section",
    "we will first consider the elementary process in the center of mass frame @xmath5 and generalize later to an arbitrary frame for the calculations on the deuteron .",
    "the amplitude contains besides nonresonant terms a resonance contribution from the @xmath1(1232 ) excitation which is described in the framework of an isobar model including its @xmath2 and @xmath3 channel contributions . for the @xmath1n@xmath0-vertex we use @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin and isospin transition operators , respectively .",
    "we have introduced a hadronic monopole form factor @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the c.m .",
    "pion momentum on the top of the resonance , i.e. , when the invariant mass @xmath11 of the @xmath0n state equals the mass of the @xmath1 resonance @xmath12 for the coupling constant , the cutoff and the @xmath1 mass we have used @xmath13    in the description of the @xmath14 vertex we follow @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic limit of the n@xmath1 current matrix element contains contributions of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole .",
    "since the strength of the electric quadrupole excitation is much smaller than the magnetic dipole one ( see e.g.  @xcite ) we will neglect it here",
    ". then the @xmath14 vertex has the form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the photon polarization vector .",
    "the energy dependent and complex coupling @xmath17 is taken from @xcite . using the nonrelativistic form of the @xmath1 propagator",

    "the parameters of the @xmath1 resonance are fixed on the @xmath26 multipole . due to the use of a constant @xmath1 mass in the @xmath1 propagator and a different cutoff @xmath29 we had to increase @xmath17 from @xcite by a factor of @xmath30 to fit the experimental multipole . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the agreement of our results with the data from @xcite is very good for both the real and imaginary part of the @xmath26 multipole up to a photon energy of about 400 mev .",
    "we would like to note that for a better description of the real part of the @xmath26 multipole the suppression of the nonresonant background by the form factor was essential .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath3 channel of the @xmath1 resonance improved the description of the @xmath31 multipole .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the results for the other leading multipoles in the three isospin channels are also shown .",
    "the description of these multipoles is in general quite satisfactory . due to the neglect of the @xmath32 excitation of the @xmath1 resonance",
    "we fail to describe the behaviour of the @xmath33 multipole .",
    "furthermore the imaginary part of all multipoles apart from the @xmath26 vanishes in our model because we have not included other resonances . in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the total cross sections for pion photoproduction on the nucleon compared to experimental data .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we used in our calculation the same parametrization of the @xmath1 resonance both for neutral and charged pion photoproduction .",
    "the price we have to pay in order to achieve a good description of all physical channels is the introduction of the above mentioned form factor into the nonresonant background amplitude .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is good up to an invariant mass of about 1300 mev ( @xmath34mev ) in the case of @xmath35 production .",
    "the @xmath36 data are slightly overestimated in the resonance region by our calculation .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the dominant process will be the quasifree reaction on one nucleon while the other acts merely as a spectator remaining at rest in the laboratory system so that the final state interaction between the nucleons and pion rescattering on the spectator nucleon may safely be neglected . in this spectator nucleon ansatz",
    "we will use the elementary amplitude discussed in sect .",
    "[ kap2 ] . due to the fermi motion in the initial state",
    "we have to use this amplitude in a form which is not restricted to a special frame of reference . for the nonresonant background",
    "this is achieved by evaluation of the corresponding feynman diagrams in an arbitrary frame .",

    "pion momentum as given by the invariant mass of the @xmath0n subsystem @xmath43 with @xmath44 we use as pion photoproduction operator in the two - nucleon system @xmath45    since the final state interaction is neglected we take plane waves for the pion and the nn - final states . for the spin @xmath46 and isospin @xmath47 part of the two nucleon wave functions we use a coupled basis .",
    "the complete antisymmetric final nn wave functions is @xmath48 only the @xmath49 channel contributes in the case of charged pions whereas for @xmath50 production both @xmath51 and @xmath49 channels have to be taken into account .",
    "now one easily writes down the matrix element for pion photoproduction on the deuteron @xmath52 with @xmath53 from ( [ g17 ] ) , where we have used the covariant normalization @xmath54 and the deuteron wave function in the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 in the laboratory frame ( deuteron rest frame ) one finds for the matrix element the following expression @xmath57 note that in ( [ g16 ] ) all spin and isospin operators act on nucleon `` 1 '' .",
    "the differential cross section is then given by @xmath58 ) and performing the spin summation in ( [ g18 ] ) explicitly , we formally reproduce the expression for the differential cross section given in @xcite for an uncoupled spin basis .",
    "now we will present our results on pion photoproduction on the deuteron using the deuteron wave function of the bonn potential ( full model ) @xcite .",
    "the discussion is diveded into two parts . in the first we compare with experimental data of the total cross section @xmath59 and the semi - exclusive differential cross section @xmath60 as a test of our model .",
    "it is obtained from the fully exclusive cross section @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total momentum of the two nucleons in the final state . in order to include symmetrically the contributions of both nucleons in the numerical integration",
    ", we have chosen @xmath63 to be an independent quantity . in the second part",
    ", we have studied the influence of pauli correlations in the final state on the differential cross section in a special kinematical situation which allows a direct comparison to the free nucleon process .",
    "we will concentrate our discussion on @xmath36 photoproduction , since no data for @xmath35 and @xmath50 production in the @xmath1 region are available . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the total cross sections for pion photoproduction on the deuteron which can be compared to the free nucleon case in the upper part . in the case of @xmath36 production on the neutron",
    "we compare our results with data from the inverse reaction @xmath64 @xcite and with data extracted from experiments on the deuteron @xcite .",
    "for the pion production operator of sect .",
    "[ kap2 ] we find an overestimation of the total cross section in the resonance peak for @xmath36 production both on the neutron and on the deuteron .",
    "for this reason we have calculated the cross sections using a nonresonant background for a lower @xmath0n coupling constant @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the description of the experimental data in the resonance peak is good .",
    "however , for photon energies below the resonance up to about 280 mev the theoretical results underestimate the data significantly .    the differential cross sections @xmath60 are shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] . the use of the pion production operator of sect .",
    "[ kap2 ] leads to an overestimation of the data for energies above 300 mev .",
    "however , the shape of the curves is in good agreement with the experiment . using the lower @xmath0n coupling @xmath65 we found a good description of the data for photon energies above 300 mev .",
    "now we will discuss the effect of the pauli correlations , i.e. , antisymmetrization of the final nn state for quasifree kinematics . in order to compare with pion photoproduction on the nucleon we did the calculation in the rest frame of the quasifree @xmath0n subsystem ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10]a ) so that its contribution to the t - matrix will be the same as that of a free nucleon in the center of mass frame apart from some minor approximations which are discussed in appendix [ app3 ] . for the genuine quasifree case in fig .",
    "[ fig10]a the relative momentum of the two nucleons in the initial state vanishes while for the spectator contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig10]b , i.e. , reaction on the spectator , the relative momentum is @xmath66 . in particular for pion production at backward angles ,",
    "the contribution of the spectator nucleon will be largely suppressed by the deuteron wave function because of the large momentum mismatch , but this will not work for small pion emission angles .    in appendix [ app3 ]",
    "we show that the neglect of the contribution of the nucleon with momentum @xmath67 in the final state leads to a very simple relation between the differential cross sections of the quasifree and the elementary processes , namely @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the momentum space wave function of the s - wave at zero momentum and @xmath70 is the total momentum of the @xmath0n system .",
    "the results for the ratio of these cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . for backward pion emission the relation ( [ g19 ] ) is verified within about @xmath71 justifying the neglect of the second nucleon for larger pion angles .",
    "however , for forward pion emission this is not any more the case .",
    "here one finds a decrease of the cross section up to about @xmath72 for small pion angles due to pauli correlations .",
    "this means that even for quasifree kinematics one will get a modification of the observables for certain kinematics which is not negligible . in our opinion",
    ", this is a very important point for the extraction of neutron data from experiments on the deuteron .",
    "we have investigated pion photoproduction on the deuteron in the @xmath73 resonance region in the spectator nucleon model neglecting final state interactions and two body processes . within this framework ,",
    "the t - matrix is given as a linear combination of the on - shell matrix elements of pion photoproduction on the two nucleons .",
    "the elementary amplitude is fitted to the pion photo production multipoles .",
    "we have presented results for total and differential cross sections .",
    "a comparison with experimental data has been possible only for @xmath36 production , where we found a slight overestimation of the data which largely go back to an overestimation of the elementary reaction on the neutron .",
    "particular attention was paid to the quasifree case for which we have studied the effect of the antisymmetrisation of the nn - final state .",
    "even for quasifree kinematics where the process is dominated by the reaction on one of the nucleons , we found an effect of about @xmath74 in the differential cross section due to presence of the second nucleon .",
    "the differences between the theoretical results and the experimental data show very clearly that the calculation of pion photoproduction on nuclei in the nucleon spectator model can only be considered as a first step towards a more realistic description of this process .",
    "the studies discussed here will serve as the basis for further investigations including the dynamics of the @xmath0nn system in a more satisfactory way .",
    "here we will give a brief derivation of equation ( [ g19 ] ) and a discussion of the approximations used .",
    "the general expression for the exclusive differential cross section is given in ( [ g18 ] ) .",
    "evaluating the @xmath75-functions with respect to the independent kinematical quantities @xmath70 and @xmath76 , one finds in the frame of reference defined in fig .  [ fig10 ]",
    "@xmath77 taking into account only the contribution of the nucleon with momentum @xmath78 in the final state the corresponding t - matrix @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 performing the spin summation in ( [ c1 ] ) explicitly one finds @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the spin projections of the nucleon in the initial and final states , respectively . due to the small binding energy of the deuteron",
    "we can use the approximation @xmath84 in the c.m .",
    "frame , the invariant mass of the @xmath0n system is given by @xmath85 from ( [ c1 ] ) with the help of ( [ c3 ] ) it is now easy to verify equation ( [ g19 ] ) @xmath86 here a second approximation is used implicitly because we compare the elementary and the quasifree process for a given invariant mass of the @xmath0n system . due to the binding of the nucleons in the deuteron",
    "there is a small difference in the corresponding photon energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 . expanding the ratio of the photon energies for a given @xmath11 with respect to the relative binding energy @xmath89 yields @xmath90",
    "the coefficient of the linear term is about @xmath91 at pion threshold and decreases with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "thus this approximation is very well justified .",
