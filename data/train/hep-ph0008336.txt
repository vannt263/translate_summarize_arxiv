    "( v ) one loop corrections are included to @xmath31 and @xmath32 which are again important for large tan@xmath30 .",
    "( vi ) the experimental bounds on the @xmath33 decay put significant constraints on the susy parameter space and theoretical calculations here include the leading order ( lo ) and approximate nlo corrections .",
    "we have not in the following imposed @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) yukawa unification or proton decay constraints as these depend sensitively on unknown post - gut physics .",
    "for example , such constraints do not naturally occur in the string models where @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) gauge symmetry is broken by wilson lines at @xmath6 ( even though grand unification of the gauge coupling constants at @xmath6 for such string models is still required ) .",

    "( we expect that while the full analysis might modify the regions of parameter space excluded by the @xmath33 experimental constraint , the minimum and maximum values of @xmath2 would probably not be significantly changed . ) the analysis of @xmath2 , taking into account the above theoretical corrections has now been carried out by several groups obtaing results in general agreement @xcite .",

    "decreases with @xmath56 for large @xmath56 , and thus if one were to increase the bound on @xmath56 to 1 tev ( @xmath70 tev ) , the cross section would drop by a factor of 2 - 3 .",

    "in the discussion of sugra models with nonuniversal soft breaking , universality for the first two generations of squark and slepton masses at @xmath6 is usually maintained to suppress flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "one allows , however , the higgs and third generation squark and slepton masses to become nonuniversal .",
    "the masses may then be parametrized at @xmath6 as follows:@xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath55 is the universal mass of the first two generations and @xmath96 are the higgs and third generation deviations from universality . in the following",
    "we will restrict the @xmath96 to obey @xmath97 the lower limit on @xmath96 is necessary to prevent tachyonic behavior , and the condition @xmath98 is taken as a reasonable upper bound .",
    "we also maintain gauge and gaugino mass unification at @xmath6 .",
    "while these models contain a large number of new parameters , their effects on @xmath2 can be charcterized approximately by the signs of @xmath99@xcite .",
    "thus the choice of @xmath100 and @xmath101 can greatly increase @xmath2 , and the reverse choice can reduce @xmath2 ( though by a much lesser amount ) . the possible increase is shown in fig.6 for tan@xmath102 , @xmath84 where nonuniversal soft breaking increases @xmath2 by a factor of 10 - 100 compared to the universal case . thus it is possible for detectors to probe regions of smaller tan@xmath30 with nonuniversal breaking , and detectors obeying eq .",
    "( 1 ) can probe part of the parameter space for tan@xmath30 as low as @xmath103 .",
    "the minimum cross section occurs ( as in msugra ) at the lowest tan@xmath30 and at the largest @xmath56 i.e. in the coannihilation region .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the case where only the higgs masses are nonuniversal i.e. @xmath104 .",
    "one finds then results similar to msugra i.e. @xmath105 pb for @xmath84 , @xmath106 600 gev . for @xmath92 , there can again be a cancellation of matrix elements reducing the cross section to @xmath107 pb when @xmath108 gev in a restricted part of the parameter space when tan@xmath10910@xcite .",
    "recent advances in string theory have stimulated again the construction of string inspired phenomenologically viable models .",
    "one type , based on type iib orientifolds @xcite puts the standard model on sets of 5 branes .",
    "these models are of interest in that they can lead to a pattern of soft breaking different from what can naturally arise in conventional supergravity guts .",
    "an interesting example@xcite has the following soft breaking pattern at @xmath6 : @xmath110 where and @xmath111 are the gaugino masses , and @xmath112 thus the @xmath113 doublets are all degenerate at @xmath6 but different from the singlets .",
    "we note eq .",

    "we consider first the case with no cp violating phases in the soft breaking sector , i.e. @xmath115=0 and the @xmath61 parameter real . in general @xmath2",
    "is a decreasing function of @xmath116 since the squark and slepton masses increase as @xmath116 decreases .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 where @xmath2 is plotted for tan@xmath30=10 , @xmath117 gev with @xmath118 ( upper curve ) and @xmath119 ( lower curve ) .",
    "one has that current detectors obeying eq .",
    "( 1 ) are sensitive to the model in the domain when tan@xmath120 .",
    "however @xmath72 is quite small when tan@xmath30 is close to the minimum value .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath2 should occur when @xmath116 and tan@xmath30 are small .",
    "8 shows the minimum cross section for @xmath121 gev , @xmath84 .",
    "one sees @xmath105 pb . as in msugra , a cancellation of matrix elements can occur for @xmath92 , allowing a smaller cross section in the domain @xmath122tan@xmath123 and reaching a minimum of @xmath124 pb for @xmath125 gev at tan@xmath126 .",
    "these low cross sections again imply very heavy gluinos i.e @xmath127 gev .",
    "the d - brane model also possesses an interesting new region of coannihilation for @xmath128 when the light chargino @xmath129 can become degenerate with @xmath1 , which has not been analyzed here .",
    "cp violating phases produce contributions to the electric dipole moments of the electron @xmath130 , and neutron @xmath131 .",
    "the bound on @xmath130 is @xmath132 ecm at 95 @xmath0 c.l.@xcite , and one must constrain the parameter space to satisfy this .",
    "this generally reduces @xmath2 by a factor of 2 - 3@xcite . however models with cp violating phases require a great deal of fine tuning unless tan@xmath133 3 - 5 , so one would expect in this case @xmath2 to be quite small .",
    "we have examined here the neutralino - proton cross section for a number of sugra type models . in all the models considered , there are regions of parameter space with @xmath46 cross sections of the size that could be observed with current detectors . thus with the sensitivity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , detectors would be sampling regions of the parameter space for msugra where tan@xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "nonuniversal models can have larger cross sections and so detectors could sample down to tan@xmath137 , while for the d - brane models considered , detectors could sample down to tan@xmath120 .",
    "the minimum cross sections these models predict are considerably below current sensitivity .",
    "thus for msugra one finds for @xmath84 @xmath138where @xmath86 gev corresponds to @xmath139 tev , @xmath140 tev .",
    "this is still in the range that would be accessible to detectors being planned ( such as genius or cryoarray ) . for @xmath92 , a cancellation can occur in certain regions of parameter space allowing the cross sections to fall below eq .",

    "this domain would appear not to be accessible to future planned detectors . since @xmath56=450 gev corresponds to @xmath143 tev",
    ", this region of parameter space would imply a gluino squark spectrum at the lhc above 1 tev .",
    "the above results holds for the msugra model . while a full analysis of coannihilation has not been carried out for the nonuniversal and d - brane models , results similar to the above hold for these over large regions of parameter space .",
    "thus for nonuniversal higgs masses and for the d - brane model one finds @xmath105 pb for @xmath84 , while a cancellelation allows @xmath2 to fall to @xmath107 pb for @xmath92 at tan@xmath144 ( with again a gluino / squark mass spectrum in the tev domain ) .    in the above",
    "we have limited @xmath56 to @xmath64 gev ( @xmath145 tev ) .",
