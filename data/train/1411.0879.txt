    "therefore , we calculated the slope of the imf for @xmath217 ( down to the @xmath212 = 0.7  0.9 bin ) for the core and within @xmath83 and @xmath218 ( down to the @xmath212 = 0.6  0.8 bin ) for the northern clump and the halo ( the area within the @xmath219 excluding the core and the northern clump , see section  [ halo_pms ] ) .",
    "the slope of the imf for stars in the rcw 49 nebula ( @xmath220 ) was calculated down to @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ) to avoid significant field star contamination in the pms locus .",
    "the most massive bins of the imf for @xmath166 , the northern clump , and the halo were calculated with a bin size of @xmath223 0.4 , because of the small number of very massive stars .",
    "as open clusters lie in the galactic plane , the membership selection and correction for field star contamination are one of the most difficult problems in the imf calculation . in the case of wd 2 ,",
    "most ms members are o- and early b - type stars selected in the @xmath48 tcd , and therefore we expect the field contamination of early - type ms stars to be negligible .",
    "but the membership selection of pms stars could be contaminated by field stars in the galactic plane .",
    "hence the imf outside @xmath83 would show an excess of low mass stars ( @xmath224 ) due to severe contamination by field stars . in order to correct for field star contamination in the pms locus , a control field which represents the field population toward the cluster",
    "is necessary .",
    "however , it is very difficult to find such a control field near very young open clusters because the spatial distribution of field stars is not uniform due to the irregular distribution of molecular clouds .",
    "we tried to subtract the number of field interlopers from the cmd of the field region [ @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) ] using the areal ratio , but obtained a highly over - subtracted imf due to the different number density of the field population .",
    "we tried another method to estimate the field contribution in the cmd by counting the number of stars in the field star locus [ stars bluer than the reddened zams by @xmath227 for @xmath228 or stars fainter than the lower boundary of the pms locus for @xmath229 as well as that in the member locus [ within two reddened zams lines [ ( @xmath228 ) or within the pms locus ( @xmath230 ) ] .",

    "the most massive field interloper was calculated to be 6.8 @xmath206 if the star is classified as a member candidate .",

    "if the expected number of agb contamination is non - negligible , we should statistically subtract them from the mir emission stars .",
    "however , the expected number of agb contamination within @xmath83 is estimated to be less than 0.2 stars using equation ( 10 ) of @xcite , and therefore we can neglect the contamination of agb stars .",
    "the contamination of background non - stellar sources is also expected to be negligible for optically detected stars , because of the large extinction due to background nebulae .",

    "while a high binary fraction is expected for wd 2 , we could not take into account the mass of the secondary stars because the photometric method can not take into account the binary fraction , as a function of stellar mass and mass ratio distribution , for a given mass range",

    "however , as shown in the h - r diagram ( fig .",
    "[ hrd ] ) , there are no distinguishably evolved stars from the ms band .",
    "wr stars have often been considered as he - burning post - ms stars , but @xcite noted that some wnh stars could be the late - h - burning stages of very massive stars .",
    "the 1.5 myr isochrone from @xcite shows no significant difference from the zams , therefore it is not easy to estimate the age from massive stars only .",
    "we simply confirm that the evolutionary stage of massive stars of wd 2 also supports the age of 1.5 myr estimated from the ms turn - on .",
    "comparison between the present mass of wr 20a ( @xmath262 and @xmath263 @xmath206 from @xcite ) and the most massive stellar evolutionary model ( @xmath203 ) of @xcite predicts an age of @xmath264 myr .",

    "there are two difficulties in an age estimation from pms stars for wd 2 .",

    "[ hrd ] , the massive pms stars seem to be younger than 1.5 myr and some extremely bright stars seem to be younger than 0.3 myr . but as noted by @xcite , an age estimation using the pms evolutionary tracks for ages younger than 1 myr may be uncertain .",
    "thus we just estimate the lower limit of the age of pms stars in wd 2 to be younger than 1 myr .",
    "it is worth checking the age of the stars in the northern clump because it may be related to the star formation history within wd 2 . but as we showed in section  [ age ] , we found no clear evidence of an age difference between the core and the northern clump , therefore we conclude that the formation of both groups seems to be coeval . there is a small filamentary structure connecting msp 18 and a very red star i d 5744 ( 2mass j10240187 - 5744152  g284.2600 - 00.3114 ) , but the star i d 5744 is too red ( @xmath266 and @xmath267 ) to be a cluster member or an object related to the filament .",
    "an unreported feature in the distribution of x - ray sources is the existence of more widely distributed sources around wd 2 .",
    "fig.1 of @xcite shows the spatial distribution of x - ray point sources and clearly reveals the presence of distributed x - ray sources up to @xmath268 arcmin from the core .",
    "many of these distributed x - ray point sources seem to have moderate photon energies ( 1  2 kev , green in fig.1 of @xcite ) and therefore they would seem to be pms stars in the halo of wd 2 . several other compact young open clusters also seem to have such a halo . from a plateau in the surface density profile",
    ", @xcite identified a stellar halo associated with the compact young open cluster hogg 15 . a very massive young open cluster , westerlund 1 , also shows a slight slope variation in its radial profile and a radial variation in the imf @xcite . such a radial variation of the imf is also seen in the massive young open cluster , ngc 3603 , which is very similar in mass and age @xcite to wd 2 .",
    "wd 2 also shows a difference in the slope of the imf between the core ( @xmath242 ) and the halo ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "therefore many of the x - ray sources in the halo of wd 2 seem to be low - mass pms stars that are widely distributed as a result of mass segregation processes .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the x - ray sources in the halo seem to be more distributed toward the south - east of the core . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ halo_cl ] , the location of the distributed x - ray sources at the south - east of the core are fully overlapped with the bright bridge of the rcw 49 nebula [ ( @xmath270 , @xmath271 )  ( @xmath272 , @xmath273 ) ] . although an extended distribution of faint stars toward the bridge is not clearly seen in the optical data due to the relatively higher reddening at the southern edge of wd 2 , a number of the early - type stars are also found at the edge of the bridge . as only a few of these x - ray sources in the bridge were identified with optical sources ,",
    "it is not easy to analyze the properties of these x - ray sources using the optical data .",
    "the bridge spatially coincides with the most redshifted cloud @xcite which implies the bridge is not a foreground cloud to wd 2 and is not the main reason for the lower detection of the x - ray sources in the optical .",
    "strong br@xmath274 emission @xcite and pah emission ( fig .",
    "10 of @xcite ) in the bridge toward wd 2 ( north - west edge of the bridge ) are also confirmed .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of a non - thermal radio emission in the bridge .",
    "a possible scenario is that these x - ray sources may be the pms stars recently formed as a consequence of sequential star formation triggered by the strong radiation field of wd 2 and that they are highly obscured by circumstellar dust or material remaining in the bridge .",
    "although x - ray emission is a good tracer of pms stars at the class ii stage , many of younger pms stars , such as class i stars , also show x - ray emission .",
    "for example , in the case of the young open cluster ngc 2264 @xcite , 41 out of 375 ( 11% ) class ii stars were identified as x - ray point sources while 19 out of 89 ( 21% ) class i stars were identified as x - ray point sources .",
    "this scenario also supports the possibility of the bright bridge being a region compressed on both sides by wd 2 and wr 20b , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the distribution of x - ray point sources , the early - type stars outside @xmath83 are distributed farther from wd 2 and seem to be linearly aligned from ( @xmath275 , @xmath276 ) to ( @xmath277 , @xmath278 ) ( fig .  [ redmap ] ) .",
    "this alignment is well matched to the large filamentary structure extended from the east to the south - west of wd 2 in the mir images .",
    "several of the early - type stars outside @xmath83 could be divided into small groups .",
    "a small group near ( @xmath275 , @xmath276 ) contains six early - type stars .",

    "there is a very compact early - type stellar group near ( @xmath277 , @xmath278 ) with five early - type stars ( i d 2914 , 2951 , 2954 , 2972 , and 3000 ) .",
    "the star i d 2972 is confirmed to be a late - o star from our spectroscopic observations and other stars seem to be early - b stars based on their reddening - corrected colours",
    ". these two groups may be isolated groups of stars in the x - ray image ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "we can consider two possibilities for the origin of the early - type stars outside @xmath83 , ( 1 ) the dynamical ejection due to the encounters among stars in the core of wd 2 , and ( 2 ) in situ star formation .",
    "recent n - body simulations @xcite predict that the ejection of massive stars is possible by dynamical encounters such as star - star , binary - star , or binary - binary interactions in a massive crowded cluster .",
    "recently @xcite reported that wr 20aa ( o2 if*/wn6 ) , wr 20c ( o2 if*/wn6 ) , and wr 21a ( o3 if*/wn6 + early - o ) are possibly ejected massive stars from wd 2 based on the geometrical alignment between these stars and wd 2 .",
    "the results of these studies support the possibility of the presence of early - type stars outside @xmath83 which were initially formed within wd 2 and ejected by dynamical encounters .",
    "but the alignment of the early - type stars along the bright filamentary structure on the mir images and the presence of the compact early - type stellar groups can not be fully explained by the dynamical encounter scenario .",
    "furthermore , the early - type stars outside @xmath83 are located in the cavities of the rcw 49 nebula in the mir images .",
    "therefore , many of the early - type stars outside @xmath83 , rather than being ejected by dynamical encounters , seem to be formed in situ and members of an ob association in the rcw 49 nebula .",
    "although we selected several ob stars outside @xmath83 from the cmds and ( @xmath280 ) tcd , the presence of additional embedded ob stars is also possible .",
    "for example , rcw 49-s2 in @xcite [ i d 5911 ( @xmath281 , @xmath282 @xmath283 ) = 2mass j10240306 - 5748356 ] shows a bow shock and seems to be an o6 ",

    "if we assume the star is an early - type star , a de - reddening on the ( @xmath163 ) cmd yields @xmath286 and @xmath156 which implies it is an early - o ( o2  o4 ) star while the spectral type from @xcite ( o6  o9 v ) implies @xmath287 . in either case ,",

    "<S> a large scatter and somewhat larger mean excess ratios above thick lines are seen in all irac bands . </S>",
    "<S> the large scatter is due to larger photometric errors in the mir bands , while the large mean colour excess ratios may be related to the excess emission from residual material around these stars . as the @xmath42 from the nir bands follows the lower edge of the scattered points in the bottom panels , the colour excess in the irac bands also agree with @xmath69 .    on the other hand , @xmath29 indicates a slightly smaller value of @xmath70 ( dashed line ) . </S>",

    "<S> we also excluded photometric doubles , known binaries , and stars that were blended in the @xmath95 images . </S>",
    "<S> a bin size of 0.2 mag was adopted , and a distribution with the same bin size but shifted by 0.1 mag was also constructed to increase the number of data points . fitting a gaussian distribution </S>",

    "<S> an average distance modulus for the stars later than o5 ( 15 stars ) is @xmath100 mag , which is well consistent with that from the zams fitting .    </S>",

    "<S> msp 223  whose light curve were well investigated by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they derived spectrophotometric distance moduli of these stars to be @xmath101 , 14.62 , @xmath102 , and 14.82 mag ( o7.5 v for msp 223 ) , respectively , using the standard reddening law of @xmath103 and equation  [ av_standard ] . </S>",
    "<S> as @xcite calculated spectrophotometric distances of msp 44 , 96 , and wr 20a based on the derived parameters from the light curves and the radial velocity curves , we recalculated the spectrophotometric distance moduli by changing the @xmath21 correction . </S>",

    "<S> the light curves of wr 20a ( @xmath106 ) and msp 96 ( @xmath107 ) are very similar to that of a contact system , and therefore the stars could be brighter than that of a detached system , possibly due to the effect of geometric distortion , reflection , and so forth . </S>",
    "<S> the distance moduli of two detached systems , msp 44 ( @xmath108 ) and msp 223 ( @xmath109 ) , are also well consistent with that determined from the zams fitting .    </S>",

    "<S> is the different reddening laws used , particularly the different @xmath49 ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , @xcite determined @xmath30 values and distance moduli of the early - type stars in wd 2 based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting using the _ hst _ @xmath116 magnitudes and the @xmath56 magnitudes from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they obtained average values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 mag , and @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) after the binary effect correction . </S>",
    "<S> as they obtained a higher @xmath30 value than @xmath103 , the discrepancy in distance determination seems not to be due to the reddening correction . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the origin of this discrepancy in the next section .      </S>",
    "<S> we examined how the possible systematic errors in the reddening correction and the zams relation affect the distance determination . for the test </S>",
    "<S> , we performed the same procedure for the de - reddening , @xmath43 and @xmath42 determination , and @xmath21 calculation using other s empirical zams relations . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical zams relations from @xcite and @xcite , which include both @xmath80 versus @xmath121 and @xmath80 versus @xmath98 relations , were used in the test . as @xcite presented @xmath80 versus @xmath121 relation down to only @xmath122 , stars with @xmath123 were excluded when using the zams from @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we found only small differences ( less than 0.01 mag in average ) between the @xmath31 derived from our result and both zams relations . </S>",
    "<S> the reddening laws derived from these zams relations are @xmath124 and @xmath125 from @xcite and @xmath124 and @xmath126 from @xcite , and so we confirm that the effect of using different zams relations is very small in determining the reddening law and @xmath21 ( less than 0.01 mag in @xmath21 ) . on the other hand , @xmath98 of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is systematically brighter than those of @xcite and @xcite . for the stars with @xmath80=-0.8  -1.05 , the average difference in @xmath98 ( @xcite - others ) is @xmath127 mag for @xcite and @xmath128 mag for @xcite , and this would cause a systematic error in distance modulus determination . as the zams of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is also brighter than other empirical zams relations ( e.g. @xmath1290.32 mag brighter than the zams of @xcite for @xmath130 - 0.2  </S>",
    "<S> -0.3 ) , the upper limit of the systematic errors in distance modulus would be smaller than this .    </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit of the systematic error in the empirical zams relation is difficult to estimate because there are no published fainter empirical zams relations for @xmath121=-0.2 -0.3 and the slope of the zams for @xmath131 is too steep . for @xmath121=-0.2 -0.3 </S>",
    "<S> , we found average differences ( @xcite - others ) of @xmath132 from @xcite , @xmath133 from @xcite , @xmath134 from @xcite , and @xmath135 from @xcite , all positive differences . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of unknown intrinsic uncertainty in the zams relation , such as that due to systematic difference in distance or photometric scatter in the sample used in the determination of the zams , is possible . for these reasons , </S>",
    "<S> the zams relation itself could involve an uncertainty of @xmath1290.1 mag , and this could contribute another source of the systematic error in our distance determination . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the distance modulus and its possible error is @xmath85 mag @xmath136 ( from the photometric error ) @xmath136 ( from the reddening law error ) @xmath6 ( the possible systematic error from the empirical zams ) ( d=6.0 kpc @xmath137 @xmath137 @xmath138 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the application of one reddening law for the foreground ( @xmath64 ) and another for the intracluster medium ( @xmath69 ) , instead of a single reddening law , does affect the @xmath21 and @xmath22 derived for individual early - type stars . if we adopt a single reddening law ( @xmath79 from our data ) , the expected difference in distance modulus is -0.13 mag for the least reddened star [ @xmath31=1.45 ] , and + 0.15 mag for the most highly reddened star [ @xmath31=2.00 ] and -0.09 mag for the stars at the lower ridge in the reddening - corrected cmds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore an additional error of -0.1 mag is expected if the reddening law toward wd 2 can be represented by a simple single - slope reddening law .    </S>",
    "<S> another source of uncertainty in the distance determination is the difference in the adopted relations between @xmath30 and colour excess ratios . </S>",
    "<S> a recent study of the nir reddening law of @xcite presented a modified relation , @xmath139 which gives a higher @xmath30 for @xmath140 stars . from this relation and </S>",
    "<S> the same zams fitting method , we obtained @xmath141 and @xmath142 mag from the two - slope reddening law and @xmath143 and @xmath142 mag from the single - slope reddening law . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should be cautious in adopting equation  [ rv_fm09 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite noted that their work was based on only 14 stars and more nir data are necessary to verify the relation . some of the stars they used to derive the above relation , such as the stars in the @xmath38 carina nebula , are members of the region which shows a clear two - slope reddening law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although @xcite is a recent study on the @xmath30 determination , their relation is determined under the assumption of a single @xmath30 which could have a more serious effect on stars with a large @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 is correlated with the grain size distribution in the line of sight as they noted , it is not easy to neglect the effect of different grain sizes between the general interstellar medium and the intracluster medium because young open clusters are formed in the dense core of a giant molecular cloud whose grain size distribution differs from that of the general interstellar medium .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent distance determination of @xcite is @xmath1290.8 mag smaller than our result . as we used the empirical zams relation of @xcite in the reddening determination </S>",
    "<S> while @xcite used the padova theoretical isochrones , it is worth checking how the adopted isochrones could affect the derived reddening law . </S>",
    "<S> we used the zams from the padova isochrones for z=0.019 and the 1 myr isochrone from the geneva models ( with rotation ) for z=0.014 . </S>",
    "<S> the padova isochrone was transformed to the photometric system of @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the foreground reddening law for the reddened foreground star i d 7081 was calculated to be @xmath144 and @xmath145 and @xmath146 and @xmath147 from the padova and geneva isochrones , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . we adopted @xmath45 to be 1.0 and 1.05 for the padova and geneva isochrones and obtained the @xmath42 to be @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the reddening law of the 1.5 myr padova isochrone and obtained a quite similar reddening law of @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 values determined for the early - type stars using the padova isochrone were systematically smaller by @xmath1290.06 mag which would result in a larger distance modulus by @xmath1290.2 mag , while the @xmath31 values calculated from the geneva isochrone were quite similar to ours within 0.01 mag . despite a slightly smaller @xmath31 from the padova isochrone , </S>",
    "<S> the derived reddening laws are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the effect due to the application of theoretical isochrones on the reddening law is also small .    despite the expected difference in distance modulus from the reddening difference ( @xmath129 + 0.2 mag for the padova isochrone ) , zams fitting indicated a smaller distance modulus of 13.5 mag from the padova isochrone , while 14.2 mag was obtained from the geneva isochrone . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one reason for the difference in distance modulus between @xcite and our work seems to be the difference between the empirical and theoretical isochrones on the observational cmds and tcd .    </S>",
    "<S> the large difference in the distance moduli between the isochrones seem to be due to the different colour - temperature relations and bolometric corrections adopted in the isochrones , because the theoretical isochrones show a large discrepancy in the observational diagrams ( cmds and tcd , this was also confirmed by @xcite for a solar mass star ) , while there are no significant differences in the ms band among several published stellar evolutionary models in the h - r diagram @xcite . for a given colour , the geneva isochrone is 0.51 mag brighter in the ( @xmath151 ) cmd and more than 0.75 mag fainter in the ( @xmath152 ) than the padova isochrone . </S>",
    "<S> the zams of @xcite is located nearly midway between the two isochrones in the both cmds and the @xmath153 cmd . additionally , the @xmath121 colour of the hottest stars of the geneva isochrone reaches @xmath154 , while the bluest @xmath121 colour of @xcite is -0.33 mag . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite noted that they used the colour - temperature relations of @xcite , but the relations gave the bluest @xmath121 colour as -0.33 mag up to mid - o stars . if they extrapolated the empirical colour - temperature relations for early - o stars , the intrinsic @xmath155 colour would be excessively blue . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we also tested the geneva isochrone with a constraint of @xmath156 for the hottest stars , but both the reddening law and the distance modulus determined from the geneva isochrone showed no significant difference due to the bluest colour of the @xmath121 .    </S>",
    "<S> the other reasons of the disagreement in distance with @xcite seems to be the reddening law and binary correction . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite obtained an average value of @xmath157 from sed fittings for individual early - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in @xmath30 between our adopted values and their value results in 0.1  0.3 mag smaller @xmath21 for @xmath31= 1.5  2.0 than our reddening law .    </S>",
    "<S> the binary correction could also be an expected source of the difference in distance modulus because we fitted the zams to the lower ridge line of the early - type members , while @xcite took the average distance modulus of individual early - type stars and adopted a binary correction of -0.12 mag based on the estimated light contribution from secondaries of o - type and early - b type stars in cyg ob 2 @xcite . however , their observed binary fraction of b - type stars ( 8/69 ) are obviously lower than o - type stars ( 12/44 ) while @xcite used 27 o - type stars and two b - type eclipsing binaries in their analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this lower binary fraction could be attributed to the lower s / n of spectra of b - type stars due to their faintness or the intrinsic difference in binary fraction between o - stars and b - stars . as there is no well - studied binary fraction or light contribution from secondaries for such a starburst - type young open cluster , especially its core , the possibility of a higher binary correction than @xmath129 - 0.1 mag to the distance modulus still can not be ruled out . in order to test the correction for the binary effect on the o - type stars in their sample </S>",
    "<S> , we ran a simple monte carlo simulation for the ob - type stars used in the @xcite using the intrinsic binary fraction of o - type stars ( 69% ) from @xcite with a mass ratio ( @xmath158=01 ) for the binary systems . for two b - type eclipsing binaries , msp 44 and 96 </S>",
    "<S> , we adopted v magnitudes for the secondaries based on the second minimum of the light curves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum , maximum and mean values of distance modulus shift from 1000 simulation runs were -0.08 , -0.45 , and @xmath159 mag , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as @xcite obtained the binary fraction of o - type stars in young open clusters with ages up to @xmath1295 myr @xcite , we also tested the binary correction using the intrinsic zams binary fraction ( binary fraction of 75% for the o - type stars and 37% for the binaries with an o - type secondary ) , ( see supplementary c.1 of @xcite ) and obtained -0.15 , -0.50 , and @xmath160 mag , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both cases indicate that a somewhat larger correction can not be ruled out for wd 2 . </S>",
    "<S> binary correction is one of the most difficult problems in stellar astronomy and it is not easy to estimate the binary effect on the distance modulus of the o - type stars in wd 2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the reasons for the difference in the distance modulus between our result and @xcite could be due to a combination of the different zams relations used ( @xmath1290.4 mag ) , the difference in @xmath21 calculation(@xmath1290.2 mag ) , and possibly to a smaller binary correction ( @xmath1290.2 mag ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that in figure 19 of @xcite , about half of their early - type members are fainter than the zams line which also supports a larger distance modulus being more appropriate for wd 2 . as the zams relation refers to the colour ( equivalently spectral type )  </S>",
    "<S> luminosity relation for  single \" ms stars with age  zero \" , we should fit the lower ridge line of the ms band , and as a result , a larger distance modulus is more appropriate for wd 2 .      </S>",
