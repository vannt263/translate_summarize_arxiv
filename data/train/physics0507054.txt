    "the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) formalism introduced four decades ago by montroll and weiss  @xcite has been successfully applied to a wide and diverse variety of physical phenomena over the years @xcite but only recently to finance @xcite . in this latter context , the efforts have been mostly focused on the statistical properties of the waiting time between successive transactions and the asset return at each transaction .",

    "we show that a satisfactory data collapse of the met is obtained when some degree of autocorrelation in the stock returns is introduced in the two - state chain markovian model .",
    "we attempt to further improve the accuracy by extending the model to a three - state markov chain for which we are still able to evaluate the met .",

    "the time auto - correlation of returns should be included in the model .",
    "we analyze the impact of these hypotheses on the empirical outcomes by performing shuffling experiments .",
    "thus , in order to test the first hypothesis we shuffle independently the time series of @xmath24 and @xmath5 and we perform the mean exit time analysis on the shuffled time series .",
    "this shuffling destroys all the time- and cross- correlations but it preserves the shape of the pdfs @xmath8 and @xmath7 and therefore the values of the scaling parameter @xmath27 and the average waiting time @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ shuffling2 ] shows a very good collapse indicating that the assumption of a master pdf for the returns of all the stocks is good working hypothesis and it is not the reason for the lack of collapse of fig .",

    "@xcite has shown that in the absence of autocorrelation of waiting times and returns ( i.i.d .",

    "what is the origin of correlation of returns ? there are , in principle , two possible answers .",
    "one contribution comes from the linear autocorrelation of the increments of returns given by @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "a second contribution is related to nonlinear properties which can be exemplified by the nonlinear correlation @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "the first contribution can be easily evaluated by taking the linear autocorrelation function of the increments of price returns .",
    "figure  [ correlation ] shows this quantity for ge ( solid line ) . in the figure it is clear that for a lag of one trade the linear autocorrelation function is negative and significantly different from zero",
    "this is a known effect of transaction prices which is due to the presence of a spread between the best bid and the best ask ( the  bid - ask bounce \" , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this short range correlation can be included in the model by using a markov process .",
    "the nonlinear correlation is related to the volatility and can be quantified by plotting the autocorrelation function of @xmath97 .",
    "the result ( dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] is a slowly decaying function indicating a long range correlation , which is probably not compatible with a markovian model .",
    "we can test the relative importance of the two contributions to the correlation of returns by performing another shuffling experiment . we can obtain a surrogate time series with the same linear autocorrelation function but with an uncorrelated volatility ( absolute value of return increments ) . the method",
    "( see for example chapter 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) consists in taking the fourier transform of the original time series and then randomize its phases . because of the wiener - kinchine theorem the linear autocorrelation of the surrogate time series is the same as the original , but the nonlinear correlation will be zero .",
    "therefore , we have a time series with the same bid - ask bounce properties but with an uncorrelated volatility .",
    "one difficulty of the method is the fact that the pdf of the surrogate series will be in general different from the original one ( unless the time series is gaussian ) .",
    "since we know that , in general , the met depends on the return pdf , we should control that the distortion of the pdf introduced by the phase randomization is not critical in changing the properties of the met . to this end",
    "we first compare the met curve of the shuffled original time series to the shuffled phase - randomized time series .",
    "these two series are both i.i.d . but with different pdfs .",
    "figure  [ surrogate ] shows that the two mets ( dashed line and squares ) are very close , thus indicating that the distortion of the pdf introduced by the phase randomization is not critical for the met properties .",
    "we can now compare the mets of the original data to the ones for the phase - randomized time series .",
    "the two series have the same linear autocorrelation function , but the first one displays a clustered volatility whereas the randomized series does not .",
