    "it is well accepted that galaxies are intimately linked to the gaseous cosmic web and that the evolution of galaxies is governed in large part by the dissipative response of baryonic gas due to the trade off of cooling and dynamical timescales as it accretes into dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "distinct modes of accretion are believed to operate and the mode is dependent primarily upon the dark matter halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and on feedback ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "`` hot - mode '' accretion is the mechanism in which inflowing gas is shock heated as it is compressed by the hot hydrostatic gas halo .",
    "this mode dominates around high mass galaxies , where the dynamical time is shorter than the cooling time . for the most part , the gas accretes into the halo , but not necessarily onto the galaxy itself .",
    "`` cold - mode '' accretion is the mechanism primarily around low mass galaxies , where the cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time so that hot hydrostatic halos do not form and cold gas accretes directly onto the galaxy . at lower redshifts , as densities decrease ,",
    "the cooling time is generally longer than dynamical time and the rate of infalling material decreases so that cold mode accretion is a minor channel of accretion onto galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though it remains an important channel for the growth of galaxies at all redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a possible third mode is the case in which cold dense filaments can penetrate directly into a hot halo of a massive galaxy .",
    "if the conditions are favorable for short cooling times in the filament , then shock heating can be avoided and the filamentary gas can directly accrete onto the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for these three complexes , several galaxies were found in the vicinity , suggesting moderate size groups .",
    "each of these studies favored a different scenario of explanation for the physical picture of the complex , including arising in `` nearside / backside '' shocked infall into the potential well of the galaxy group @xcite , intragroup gas or an unvirialized filamentary structure through the group @xcite , and tidally stripped material from one of the nearby galaxies @xcite .",

    "we further deduced the complex is consistent with a combination of photo and collisional ionized gas .",
    "based upon expectations of simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we favored a shock heated structure with chemical enrichment consistent with the high redshift intergalactic medium .",
    "our interpretation was that the complex is a shock heated filamentary structure that originated as a photoionized diffuse phase of gas at high redshift and is accreting in the vicinity of the @xmath17 elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , the fos data did not provide the information required to examine the detailed structure of the kinematic and ionization conditions .",

    "the cosmological simulations of @xcite , which treat accretion and feedback processes , yield a substantial fraction of red , high mass galaxies independent of overdensity .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that massive early - type galaxies are built in two phases .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rate at which the cooling time increases with decreasing redshift [ @xmath751 is more rapid than the increase in the dynamical time with decreasing redshift , [ @xmath752 .",
    "thus , it is generally found in simulations that , at high redshifts , cold streams can often penetrate the hot halos and accrete onto the galaxies , whereas at intermediate to low redshifts , the longer cooling time results in the heating and shocking of the cold filaments , which then accrete into the halo but not onto the galaxy @xcite .",
    "galaxy g1 may have experienced the process in which it formed stars early during its initial accretion , perhaps even experiencing cold accretion from the filament that we are observing , and then at later times the accretion penetrated no further than into the halo , resulting in a high mass , metal - rich , early - type galaxy with quenched star formation .",

    "the hot cloud ( # 11 ) exhibits the signature of the shocked portion of the filament , and the multiphase absorbers ( clouds # 8 - 10 ) exhibit the signature of a conductive interface . galaxy g1 is probed by the quasar sight line impact parameter at @xmath753 .",
    "simulations indicate that `` cold '' filaments ( i.e. , those that have not been heated above @xmath754 ) penetrate no deeper than @xmath755 at intermediate redshifts @xcite , suggesting that the sight line is intercepting the filament in the outer part of the virialized halo .    a cartoon model of this interpretation",

    "presumably , any components of the filament that have not yet been shocked will be shock heated and their cooling time will increase to be on the order of the hubble time ( as is deduced for cloud # 11 ) .",
    "those components that may reside within the shock radius will likely not survive past @xmath759 and be assimilated into the hot halo .",
    "this would imply that , ultimately , the filament will accrete into the halo , be heated to the halo temperature , and never accrete onto the galaxy itself .",
    "galaxy g1 has likely not had new gas to fuel star formation for several gigayears and will likely not acquire new gas via accretion as it evolves .",

    "* ) of massive galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath779 ) , our observations and analysis indicate that the gas accreting into the halo of galaxy g1 at times after its formation epoch have not accreted onto the galaxy itself and that the complex will also not accrete onto the galaxy . as such , the star formation of galaxy g1 has likely been quenched for gigayears .    though it is difficult to definitively determine the nature of the absorbing complex , the scenario we favor is highly plausible and consistent with simulations and theory .",
    "in fact , the data appear to provide convincing evidence that theory and simulations correctly predict by @xmath7 , cold accretion via filaments in high mass galaxies is shock heated as it accreted into the virialized hot halos and that this gas then grows the halos , but does not fuel further star formation .",

    "<S> using _ hst_/cos / stis and hires / keck high - resolution spectra , we have studied a remarkable absorbing complex at @xmath0 toward the quasar q1317 + 277 . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption has a velocity spread of @xmath1  , comprises 21 voigt profile components , and resides at an impact parameter of @xmath2 kpc from a bright , high mass ( @xmath3 ) elliptical galaxy that is deduced to have a 6 gyr old , solar metallicity stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> ionization models suggest the majority of the structure is cold gas surrounding a shock heated cloud that is kinematically adjacent to a multi - phase group of clouds with detected , and absorption , suggestive of a conductive interface near the shock . </S>",
    "<S> the deduced metallicities are consistent with the moderate _ in situ _ enrichment relative to the levels observed in the @xmath4 forest . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the complex as a metal - poor filamentary structure being shock heated as it accretes into the halo of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the data support the scenario of an early formation period ( @xmath5 ) in which the galaxy was presumably fed by cold - mode gas accretion that was later quenched via virial shocking by the hot halo such that , by intermediate redshift , the cold filamentary accreting gas is continuing to be disrupted by shock heating . </S>",
    "<S> thus , continued filamentary accretion is being mixed into the hot halo , indicating that the star formation of the galaxy will likely remain quenched . to date , the galaxy and the absorption complex provide some of the most compelling observational data supporting the theoretical picture in which accretion is virial shocked in the hot coronal halos of high mass galaxies . </S>"
