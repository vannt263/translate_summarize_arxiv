    "0.275 in optical packet - switched ring wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) networks have emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the capacity shortage in the metropolitan area , which is commonly referred to as metro gap .",
    "packet - switched ring networks , such as the resilient packet ring ( rpr )  @xcite , overcome many of the shortcomings of circuit - switched ring networks , such as low provisioning flexibility for packet data traffic  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the use of multiple wavelength channels in wdm ring networks , see e.g. ,  @xcite , overcomes a key limitation of rpr , which was originally designed for a single - wavelength channel in each ring direction . in optical packet - switched ring networks ,",
    "the destination nodes typically remove ( strip ) the packets destined to them from the ring .",
    "destination stripping _ allows the destination node as well as other nodes downstream to utilize the wavelength channel for their own transmissions . with this",
    "so - called _ spatial wavelength reuse _ , multiple simultaneous transmissions can take place on any given wavelength channel . spatial wavelength reuse is maximized through shortest path routing ,",
    "whereby the source node sends a packet in the ring direction that reaches the destination with the smallest hop distance , i.e. , traversing the smallest number of intermediate network nodes .",
    "multicast traffic is widely expected to account for a large portion of the metro area traffic due to multi - party communication applications , such as tele - conferences  @xcite , virtual private network interconnections , interactive distance learning , distributed games , and content distribution .",
    "these multi - party applications are expected to demand substantial bandwidths due to the trend to deliver the video component of multimedia content in the high - definition television ( hdtv ) format or in video formats with even higher resolutions , e.g. , for digital cinema and tele - immersion applications . while there is at present scant quantitative information about the multicast traffic volume",
    ", there is ample anecdotal evidence of the emerging significance of this traffic type  @xcite . as a result",
    ", multicasting has been identified as an important service in optical networks  @xcite and has begun to attract significant attention in optical networking research as outlined in section  [ lit : sec ] .",
    "metropolitan area networks consist typically of edge rings that interconnect several access networks ( e.g. , ethernet passive optical networks ) and connect to a metro core ring  @xcite .",
    "the metro core ring interconnects several metro edge rings and connects to the wide area network .",
    "the node connecting a metro edge ring to the metro core ring is typically a traffic hotspot as it collects / distributes traffic destined to / originating from other metro edge rings or the wide area network .",
    "similarly , the node connecting the metro core ring to the wide area network is typically a traffic hotspot . examining",
    "the capacity of optical packet - switched ring networks for hotspot traffic is therefore very important .    in this paper",
    "we examine the multicast capacity ( maximum achievable long run average multicast packet throughput ) of bidirectional wdm optical ring networks with a single hotspot for a general fanout traffic model comprising unicast , multicast , and broadcast traffic .",
    "we consider an arbitrary traffic mix composed of uniform traffic , hotspot destination traffic ( from regular nodes to the hotspot ) , and hotspot source traffic ( from the hotspot to regular nodes ) .",
    "we study the widely considered node architecture that allows nodes to transmit on all wavelength channels , but to receive only on one channel .",
    "we initially examine shortest path routing by deriving bounds and approximations for the ring segment utilization probabilities due to uniform , hotspot destination , and hotspot source packet traffic .",
    "we prove that there are three ring segments ( in a given ring direction ) that govern the maximum segment utilization probability .",
    "for the clockwise direction in a network with nodes @xmath0 and wavelengths @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) , whereby node 1 receives on wavelength 1 , node 2 on wavelength 2 , @xmath3 , node @xmath4 on wavelength @xmath4 , node @xmath5 on wavelength 1 , and so on , and with node @xmath6 denoting the index of the hotspot node , the three critical segments are identified as :    * the segment connecting the hotspot , node @xmath6 , to node 1 on wavelength 1 , * the segment connecting node @xmath7 to node @xmath4 on wavelength @xmath4 , and * the segment connecting node @xmath8 to node @xmath6 on wavelength @xmath4 .",
    "the utilization on these three segments limits the maximum achievable multicast packet throughput .",
    "we observe from the derived utilization probability expressions that the utilizations of the first two identified segments exceed 1/2 ( and approach 1 ) for large fractions of hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic , whereas the utilization of the third identified segment is always less than or equal to 1/2 .",
    "thus , shortest path routing achieves a long run average multicast throughput of less than two simultaneous packet transmissions ( and approaching one simultaneous packet transmission ) for large portions of hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic .",
    "we specify one - copy routing which sends only one packet copy for hotspot source traffic , while uniform and hotspot destination packet traffic is still served using shortest path routing .",
    "one - copy routing ensures a capacity of at least two simultaneous packet transmissions for arbitrary hotspot source traffic , and at least approximately two simultaneous packet transmissions for arbitrary overall traffic .",
    "we verify the accuracy of our bounds and approximations for the segment utilization probabilities , which are exact in the limit @xmath9 , through comparisons with utilization probabilities obtained from discrete event simulations .",
    "we also quantify the gains in maximum achievable multicast throughput achieved by the one - copy routing strategy over shortest path routing through simulations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the following subsection , we review related work . in section",
    "[ model : sec ] , we introduce the detailed network and traffic models and formally define the multicast capacity . in section  [ gen_prop : sec ]",
    ", we establish fundamental properties of the ring segment utilization in wdm packet rings with shortest path routing . in section  [ util_laneqla : sec ] , we derive bounds and approximations for the ring segment utilization due to uniform , hotspot destination , and hotspot source packet traffic on the wavelengths that the hotspot is not receiving on , i.e. , wavelengths @xmath10 in the model outlined above . in section",

    "we conclude in section  [ concl : sec ] .",

    "the multicast capacity of a single - wavelength packet - switched ring with non - uniform traffic was examined in  @xcite .",

    "we consider the family of node structures where each node can transmit on any wavelength using either one or multiple tunable transmitters @xmath15 or an array of @xmath4 fixed - tuned transmitters @xmath16 , and receive on one wavelength using a single fixed - tuned receiver @xmath17 .    for @xmath18",

    "our results hold also for traffic patterns with correlations , as long as the long run average segment utilizations are equivalent to the utilizations with the independence assumption .",
    "for instance , our results hold for a correlated traffic model where a given source node transmits with a probability @xmath60 to exactly the same set of destinations as the previous packet sent by the node , and with probability @xmath61 to an independently randomly drawn number and set of destination nodes .",

    "we denote the set of nodes with drop wavelength @xmath29 by @xmath66 the set of all destinations with drop wavelength @xmath29 is then @xmath67    moreover , we use the following notation : for @xmath68 we denote the probability of @xmath69 destinations on wavelength @xmath29 by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for uniform , hotspot destination , and hotspot source traffic , respectively . since the fanout set is chosen uniformly at random among all subsets of @xmath47 having cardinality @xmath45 , these usage - probabilities can be expressed by @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . depending on whether the sender is on the drop - wavelength or",
    "not , we obtain slightly different expressions .",
    "as will become evident shortly , it suffices to focus on the case where the sender is on the considered drop wavelength @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath76 , since the relevant probabilities are estimated through comparisons with transformations ( enlarged , reduced or right / left - shifted ring introduced in appendix  [ appendixa ] ) that put the sender in @xmath77 .    through elementary combinatorial considerations we obtain the following probability distributions : for uniform traffic , the probability for having @xmath78 destinations on wavelength @xmath29 is @xmath79 for hotspot destination traffic , we obtain for wavelengths @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 as well as for wavelength @xmath4 homing the hotspot and @xmath83 @xmath84 finally , for hotspot source traffic , we obtain for @xmath80 and @xmath78 @xmath85 and for @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88    for a given wavelength @xmath29 , we denote by @xmath89 the probability measure @xmath48 conditioned upon @xmath90 , and define @xmath91 and @xmath92 analogously .",
    "whenever it is clear which wavelength @xmath29 is considered we omit the subscript @xmath29 and write @xmath93 , or @xmath94 .",
    "we introduce the set of active nodes @xmath95 on a given drop wavelength @xmath29 as @xmath96 we order the nodes in this set in increasing order of their node indices , i.e. , @xmath97 and consider the `` gaps '' @xmath98 between successive nodes in the set @xmath99 we have denoted here again by @xmath100 the random number of destinations with drop wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "for shortest path routing , i.e. , to maximize spatial wavelength reuse , we determine the largest of these gaps . since there may be a tie among the largest gaps ( in which case one of the largest gaps is chosen uniformly at random ) , we denote the selected largest gap as `` @xmath101 '' \" ( for `` chosen largest gap '' ) .",
    "suppose the @xmath101 is between nodes @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "with shortest path routing , the packet is then sent from the sender @xmath32 to node @xmath102 , and from the sender @xmath32 to node @xmath103 in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , the largest gap is not traversed by the packet transmission .",
    "note that by symmetry , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "more generally , for reasons of symmetry , it suffices to compute the utilization probabilities for the clockwise oriented edges . for @xmath106",
    ", we abbreviate @xmath107 it will be convenient to call node @xmath6 also node @xmath13 .",
    "we let @xmath108 , be a random variable denoting the first node bordering the chosen largest gap on wavelength @xmath29 , when this gap is considered clockwise .",
    "the utilization probability for the clockwise segment @xmath109 on wavelength @xmath29 is given by @xmath110 our primary performance metric is the maximum packet throughout ( stability limit ) .",
    "more specifically , we define the ( effective ) multicast capacity @xmath111 as the maximum number of packets ( with a given traffic pattern ) that can be sent simultaneously in the long run , and note that @xmath111 is given as the reciprocal of the largest ring segment utilization probability , i.e. , @xmath112",
    "first , we prove a general recursion formula for shortest path routing .",
    "[ prop31 ] let @xmath113 be a fixed wavelength . for all nodes",
    "@xmath114 , @xmath115    there are two complementary events leading to @xmath116 : ( a ) the packet traverses ( on wavelength @xmath29 ) both the clockwise segment @xmath117 and the preceding clockwise segment @xmath118 , i.e. , the sender is a node @xmath119 , and ( b ) node @xmath109 is the sender ( @xmath120 ) and transmits the packet in the clockwise direction , so that it traverses segment @xmath121 following node @xmath109 ( in the clockwise direction ) .",
    "formally , @xmath122 next , note that the event that the clockwise segment @xmath118 is traversed can be decomposed into two complementary events , namely ( a ) segments @xmath118 and @xmath117 are traversed , and ( b ) segment @xmath118 is traversed , but not segment @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath123 similarly , we can decompose the event of node @xmath109 being the sender as @xmath124 hence , we can express @xmath125 as @xmath126 now , note that there are two complementary events that result in the clg to start at node @xmath109 , such that clockwise segment @xmath127 is inside the clg : @xmath128 node @xmath109 is the last destination node reached by the clockwise transmission , i.e. , segment @xmath109 is used , but segment @xmath127 is not used , and @xmath129 node @xmath109 is the sender and transmits only a packet copy in the counter clockwise direction .",
    "hence , @xmath130 therefore , we obtain the general recursion @xmath131    we introduce the left ( counter clockwise ) shift and the right ( clockwise ) shift of node @xmath109 to be @xmath132 and @xmath133 given by @xmath134 the counter clockwise shift maps a node @xmath109 not homed on @xmath29 onto the nearest node in the counter clockwise direction that is homed on @xmath29 . similarly , the clockwise shift maps a node @xmath109 not homed on @xmath29 onto the closest node in the clockwise direction that is homed on @xmath29 .    for the traffic on wavelength @xmath29 , we obtain by repeated application of proposition [ prop31 ] @xmath135 note that the clg on @xmath29 can only start @xmath128 at the source node , irrespective of whether it is on @xmath29 , or @xmath129 at a destination node on @xmath29 .",
    "consider a given node @xmath109 that is not on @xmath29 , then the nodes in @xmath136 are not on @xmath29 .",
    "( if node @xmath109 is on @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath137 , then trivially the set @xmath138 is empty and @xmath139 . )",
    "hence , the clg on @xmath29 can only start at a node in @xmath140 if that node is the source node , i.e. , @xmath141 next , note that the event that a node in @xmath138 is the source node can be decomposed into the two complementary events @xmath128 a node in @xmath142 is the source node and the clg on @xmath29 starts at that node , and @xmath129 a node in @xmath142 is the source node and the clg does not start at that node .",
    "hence , @xmath143 inserting ( [ glambdaequals ] ) and ( [ pscomplement ] ) in ( [ pnlambda1 ] ) we obtain @xmath144 which directly leads to    [ cor critical non critical ] the usage of non - critical segments is smaller than the usage of critical segments , more precisely for @xmath145 : @xmath146    to compare the expected length of the largest gap on a wavelength in the wdm ring with the expected length of the largest gap in the single wavelength ring , we introduce the enlarged and reduced ring in appendix  [ appendixa ] . in brief , in the enlarged ring , an extra node is added on the considered wavelength between the @xmath29-neighbors of the source node .",
    "this enlargement results in @xmath147 a set of @xmath148 nodes homed on the considered wavelength , and @xmath149 an enlarged set of active nodes @xmath150 containing the original destination nodes plus the added extra node ( which in a sense represents the source node on the considered wavelength ) for a total of @xmath151 active nodes .",
    "the expected length of the largest gap on this enlarged wavelength ring with @xmath152 active nodes among @xmath148 nodes homed on the wavelength ( a ) is equivalent to @xmath4 times the expected length of the largest gap on a single wavelength ring with @xmath153 destination nodes and one source node among @xmath6 nodes homed on the ring , and ( b ) provides an upper bound on the expected length of the largest gap on the original wavelength ring ( before the enlargement ) .    in the reduced ring , the left- and right - shifted source node are merged into one node on the considered wavelength , resulting @xmath147 in a set of @xmath154 nodes homed on the considered wavelength , and @xmath149 a set @xmath155 of @xmath156 , or @xmath152 active nodes .",
    "the expected length of the largest gap decreases with increasing number of active nodes , hence we consider the case with @xmath152 active nodes for a lower bound .",
    "the expected length of the largest gap on the reduced wavelength ring with @xmath152 active nodes among @xmath157 nodes homed on the wavelength ( a ) is equivalent to @xmath4 times the expected length of the largest gap on a single wavelength ring with @xmath153 destination nodes and one source node among @xmath6 nodes homed on the ring , and ( b ) provides a lower bound on the expected length of the largest gap on the original wavelength ring ( before the reduction ) .",
    "from these two constructions , which are formally provided in appendix  [ appendixa ] , we directly obtain :    [ prop33 ] given that the cardinality of @xmath158 is @xmath69 , the expected length of the clg on wavelength @xmath29 is bounded by : @xmath159 where @xmath160 denotes the expected length of the clg for a single wavelength ring with @xmath6 nodes , when the active set is chosen uniformly at random from all subsets of @xmath161 with cardinality @xmath162 .",
    "the expected length of the largest gap @xmath163 @xcite is given for @xmath164 , by @xmath165 , where @xmath166 denotes the distribution of the length of the largest gap .",
    "let @xmath167 denote the probability that an arbitrary gap has @xmath168 hops .",
    "then the distribution @xmath169 may be computed using the recursion @xmath170 together with the initialization @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where @xmath173 denotes the kronecker delta .",
    "whereby , @xmath171 means a ring with only one active node has only one gap of length @xmath6 , hence the largest gap has length @xmath6 with probability one .",
    "similarly , @xmath172 means a ring with all nodes active ( broadcast case ) has @xmath6 gaps with length one , hence the largest gap has length @xmath174 with probability one .",
    "this initialization directly implies @xmath175 as well as @xmath176 .",
    "obviously , we have to set @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "in the setting of uniform traffic , one has for all @xmath179 and @xmath180 , for reasons of symmetry : @xmath181 for @xmath179 , the difference between critical and non - critical edges , corresponding to corollary [ cor critical non critical ] , can be estimated by @xmath182    with shortest path routing , on average @xmath183 segments are traversed on @xmath29 to serve a uniform traffic packet .",
    "equivalently , we obtain the expected number of traversed segments by summing the utilization probabilities of the individual segments , i.e. , as @xmath184 , which , due to symmetry , equals @xmath185 .",
    "hence , @xmath186 and @xmath187 expressing @xmath188 using corollary [ cor critical non critical ] , we obtain @xmath189 solving for @xmath190 yields @xmath191 hence , the inequalities ( [ estimating the difference ] ) lead to @xmath192 employing the bounds for @xmath193 from proposition  [ prop33 ] gives @xmath194      the only difference to uniform traffic is that @xmath6 can not be a sender , since it is already a destination , i.e. , @xmath195 using @xmath196 , we obtain @xmath197 due to the factor @xmath198 , the second term is negligible in the context of large networks .",
    "since node @xmath6 is the sender ( and given that there is at least one destination node on @xmath29 ) , it sends a packet copy over segment @xmath199 on wavelength @xmath29 if the clg on @xmath29 starts at a node with index @xmath109 or higher .",
    "hence , the usage probability of a segment can be computed as @xmath200 for @xmath106 .",
    "we notice immediately that @xmath201 is monotone decreasing in @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath202 , equation ( [ critical non critical ] ) simplifies to @xmath203 since the sender is node @xmath204 and consequently @xmath205 for the considered @xmath206 . since @xmath201 is monotone decreasing in @xmath109 , the maximally used critical segment on wavelength @xmath29",
    "is @xmath207 .",
    "with node @xmath6 being the sender , the clg on @xmath29 can only start at the source node @xmath204 , or at a destination node homed on @xmath29 .",
    "if the clg does not start at @xmath204 , the segment @xmath207 leading to the first node homed on @xmath29 , namely node @xmath29 , is utilized .",
    "hence , @xmath208 observe that @xmath209 which is exploited in section  [ summarylaneqla : sec ] .    enlarging the ring leads to @xmath210 since the gaps bordering node @xmath13 are enlarged whereas the lengths of all other gaps are unchanged .",
    "a right shifting of @xmath32 yields the following lower bound : @xmath211 thus , @xmath212      for @xmath80 we obtain from ( [ segment_util : eqn ] ) and ( [ hsdestsegutil ] ) @xmath214 using corollary [ cor critical non critical ] for @xmath215 and ( [ gamma usage for ungleich ] ) for @xmath94 yields @xmath216 i.e. , the segment number @xmath29 experiences the maximum utilization on wavelength @xmath29 .",

    "hence , by proposition  [ prop31 ] : @xmath230 moreover , we have from corollary [ cor critical non critical ] with @xmath231 and @xmath86 : @xmath232    to estimate @xmath233 , we introduce , as before , the left- resp",

    "in particular , we obtain from section  3.1.3 in  @xcite for @xmath241 @xmath242 and @xmath243      inserting the bounds derived in the preceding sections in ( [ segment_util : eqn ] ) , we obtain @xmath244 and @xmath245 whereby @xmath246 is given by setting @xmath86 in ( [ mu_laell : eqn ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath247 and @xmath248    considering again these bounds for large @xmath221 , we obtain the approximations : @xmath249 as well as @xmath250",
    "with ( [ max lambda neq lambda ] ) and a detailed consideration of wavelength @xmath86 , we prove in appendix  [ appendixc ] the main theoretical result :    [ mainthm ] the maximum segment utilization probability is @xmath251    it thus remains to compute the three probabilities on the right hand side .",
    "we have no exact result in the most general setting ( it would be possible to give recursive formulae , but these would be prohibitively complex ) .",
    "however , we have given upper and lower bounds and approximations in sections  [ summarylaneqla : sec ] and  [ summarylaeqla : sec ] , which match rather well in most situations , as demonstrated in the next section , and have the same asymptotics when @xmath252 while @xmath4 remains fixed .    toward assessing the considered shortest - path routing strategy ,",
    "we directly observe , that @xmath253 is always less or equal to @xmath254 . on the other hand , the first two usage probabilities will , for @xmath38 large enough , become larger than @xmath254 , especially for hotspot source traffic with moderate to large fanouts .",
    "hence , shortest - path routing will result in a multicast capacity of less than two for large portions of hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic , which may arise in content distribution , such as for ip tv .",
    "the intuitive explanation for the high utilization of the segments @xmath255 and @xmath256 with shortest - path routing for multi- and broadcast hotspot source traffic is a follows .",
    "consider the transmission of a given hotspot source traffic packet with destinations on wavelength @xmath4 homing the hotspot . if the packet has a single destination uniformly distributed among the other @xmath157 nodes homed on wavelength @xmath4 , then the clg is adjacent and to the left ( i.e. , in the counter clockwise sense ) of the hotspot with probability one half .",
    "hence , with probability one half a packet copy is sent in the clockwise direction , utilizing the segment @xmath256 . with an increasing number of uniformly distributed destination nodes on wavelength @xmath4 , it becomes less likely that the clg is adjacent and to the left of the hotspot , resulting in increased utilization of segment @xmath256 . in the extreme case of a broadcast destined from the hotspot to all other @xmath157 nodes homed on @xmath4 , the clg is adjacent and to the left of the hotspot with probability @xmath257 , i.e. , segment @xmath256 is utilized with probability @xmath258 . with probability @xmath259",
    "the clg is not adjacent to the hotspot , resulting in two packet copy transmissions , i.e. , a packet copy is sent in each ring direction .    for wavelength 1 ,",
    "the situation is subtly different due to the rotational offset of the nodes homed on wavelength 1 from the hotspot .",
    "that is , node 1 has a hop distance of 1 from the hotspot ( in the clockwise direction ) , whereas the highest indexed node on wavelength 1 , namely node @xmath260 has a hop distance of @xmath7 from the hotspot ( in the counter clockwise direction ) . as for wavelength @xmath4 , for a given packet with a single uniformly distributed destination on wavelength 1 ,",
    "the clg is adjacent and to the left of the hotspot with probability one half , and the packet consequently utilizes segment @xmath255 with probability one half . with increasing number of destinations , the probability of the clg being adjacent and to the left of the hotspot decreases , and the utilization of segment @xmath255 increases , similar to the case for wavelength @xmath4 . for a broadcast destined to all @xmath221 nodes on wavelength 1 ,",
    "the situation is different from wavelength @xmath4 , in that the clg is never adjacent to the hotspot , i.e. , the hotspot always sends two packet copies , one in each ring direction .      to overcome the high utilization of the segments @xmath255 and @xmath256 due to hotpot source multi- and broadcast traffic , we propose _ one - copy ( oc ) routing _ : with one - copy routing , uniform traffic and hotspot destination traffic are still served using shortest path routing .",
    "hotspot source traffic is served using the following counter - based policy .",
    "we define the counter @xmath261 to denote the number of nodes homed on @xmath29 that would need to be traversed to reach all destinations on @xmath29 with one packet transmission in the clockwise direction ( whereby the final reached destination node counts as a traversed node ) .",
    "if @xmath262 , then one packet copy is sent in the clockwise direction to reach all destinations .",
    "if @xmath263 , then one packet copy is sent in the counter clockwise direction to reach all destinations .",
    "ties , i.e. , @xmath264 , are served in either clockwise or counter clockwise direction with probability one half . for hotspot source traffic with arbitrary traffic fanout , this counter - based one - copy routing ensures a maximum utilization of one half on any ring segment .",
    "note that the counter - based policy considers only the nodes homed on the considered wavelength @xmath29 to ensure that the rotational offset between the wavelength @xmath4 homing the hotspot and the considered wavelength @xmath29 does not affect the routing decisions .",
    "we propose the following strategy for switching between shortest path ( sp ) and one - copy ( oc ) routing .",
    "shortest path routing is employed if both ( [ sim 1 ] ) and ( [ sim 2 ] ) are less than one half .",
    "if ( [ sim 1 ] ) or ( [ sim 2 ] ) exceeds one half , then one - copy routing is used . for the practical implementation of this switching strategy , the hotspot can periodically estimate the current traffic parameters , i.e. , the traffic portions @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 , and @xmath38 as well as the corresponding fanout distributions @xmath265 , @xmath266 , and @xmath267 , for instance , through a combination of traffic measurements and historic traffic patterns , similar to  @xcite . from these traffic parameter estimates ,",
    "the hotspot can then evaluate ( [ sim 1 ] ) and ( [ sim 2 ] ) .    to obtain a more refined criterion for switching between shortest path routing and one - copy routing",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we characterize the maximum segment utilization with shortest path routing more explicitly by inserting ( [ sim 1 ] ) , ( [ sim 2 ] ) , and ( [ sim 3 ] ) in ( [ mainthm : eqn ] ) to obtain : @xmath268 whereby we noted that the definition of @xmath70 in ( [ mu_laell : eqn ] ) directly implies that @xmath70 is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the hotspot source traffic does not influence the maximum segment utilization as long as @xmath269 and @xmath270 thus , if @xmath271 , then all traffic is served using shortest path routing .",
    "we next note that theorem  [ mainthm ] does not hold for the one - copy routing strategy .",
    "we therefore bound the maximum segment utilization probability with one - copy routing by observing that ( [ pellalphabounds ] ) together with proposition  [ cor critical non critical ] and ( [ estimating the difference ] ) implies that asymptotically for all @xmath272 @xmath273 hence , @xmath274 is asymptotically constant .",
    "moreover , similar as in the single wavelength case  @xcite , we have @xmath275 therefore , the maximum segment utilization with one - copy routing is ( approximately ) bounded by @xmath276    comparing ( [ oc_util : eqn ] ) with ( [ mainthm : eqn ] ) we observe that the maximum segment utilization with one - copy routing is smaller than with shortest path routing if the following threshold conditions hold :    * if @xmath277 , then set @xmath278 otherwise set @xmath279 . * if @xmath280 , then set @xmath281 otherwise set @xmath282 .    if @xmath283 , then one - copy routing is employed",

    "the hotspot could also obtain the segment utilization probabilities with one - copy routing through discrete event simulations to determine whether shortest path routing or one - copy routing of the hotspot traffic is preferable for a given set of traffic parameter estimates .",
    "in this section we present numerical results obtained from the derived bounds and approximations of the utilization probabilities as well as verifying simulations .",

    "<S> packet - switching wdm ring networks with a hotspot transporting unicast , multicast , and broadcast traffic are important components of high - speed metropolitan area networks . for an arbitrary multicast fanout traffic model with uniform , hotspot destination , and hotspot source packet traffic </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the maximum achievable long - run average packet throughput , which we refer to as _ multicast capacity _ , of bi - directional shortest - path routed wdm rings . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three segments that can experience the maximum utilization , and thus , limit the multicast capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the segment utilization probabilities through bounds and approximations , which we verify through simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that shortest - path routing can lead to utilization probabilities above one half for moderate to large portions of hotspot source multi- and broadcast traffic , and consequently multicast capacities of less than two simultaneous packet transmissions . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a one - copy routing strategy that guarantees a multicast capacity of at least two simultaneous packet transmissions for arbitrary hotspot source traffic .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : hotspot traffic , multicast , packet throughput , shortest path routing , spatial reuse , wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) . </S>"
