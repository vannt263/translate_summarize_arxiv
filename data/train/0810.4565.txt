    "high energy particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification appear to be tightly related phenomena in many astrophysical environments .",
    "for instance , x - ray observations of synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic electrons in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite suggest that electrons are efficiently accelerated in these environments , and that the ambient magnetic field in the dowstream medium of snr forward shocks is amplified by a factor of @xmath5 compared to its typical value in the interstellar medium . also , cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies up to @xmath6ev are believed to originate in snrs .",
    "calculations based on the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism @xcite show that such high energies can only be reached if crs are efficiently confined to the remnant @xcite , a condition that would be eased by a substantial magnetic field amplification . while it is supported by direct observations of snrs ,",
    "the process by which the field amplification takes place is still a mystery .",
    "@xcite suggested the possibility of magnetic amplification driven by non - resonant crs propagating in the upstream region of shocks .",
    "this instability is different from the alfvn wave amplification due to cyclotron resonance with crs @xcite . instead",
    ", it only requires positively charged crs propagating along a background magnetic field , @xmath7 , with larmor radii much larger than the wavelength of the wave .",
    "this condition is expected to be satisfied by diffusively shock - accelerated crs in the upstream region of both relativistic and non - relativistic shocks . while individual crs are relativistic , on average they stream with respect to the upstream plasma with a drift velocity , @xmath8 , that depends on the distance from the shock .",
    "the lowest energy crs are efficiently confined to the shock vicinity by the upstream turbulence , and drift with the shock with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the shock speed .",
    "the higher energy crs are less affected by the upstream scattering , so they tend to escape more easily from the shock .",
    "thus , as the distance from the shock increases , @xmath8 will increase , asymptotically approaching @xmath11 for non - relativistic shocks ( for relativistic shocks , @xmath12 everywhere ) .",
    "also , considering that electrons are more affected by radiative losses than ions , it is reasonable to think that at some distance from the shock crs will be mainly positively charged particles .",
    "their drift will drive a constant current , @xmath13 , through the upstream plasma .",
    "this current will be compensated by the opposite return current , @xmath14 , provided by the background plasma .",
    "if there is a small magnetic field perturbation @xmath15 , perpendicular to @xmath7 , a @xmath16 force will push the background plasma transversely . a force of the same magnitude will push the crs in the opposite direction , so that the net force acting on the background plasma - crs system vanishes .",
    "however , given the high rigidity of the crs , only the background plasma will experience a significant transverse motion . for a helical magnetic perturbation @xmath15 , this transverse motion will stretch the magnetic field lines , producing an amplification of @xmath15 . using analytic mhd analysis",
    ", @xcite showed that for a right - handed circularly polarized electromagnetic wave , this amplification would be exponential , and faster than the resonant instability and @xmath13 are parallel . in the antiparallel case ,",
    "the polarization is left - handed ] .",
    "the linear dispersion relation of this cosmic ray current - driven ( crcd ) instability has been calculated using both mhd @xcite and kinetic treatments @xcite .",
    "these works found that , if @xmath13 is kept constant , the instability will grow at a prefered wavelength @xmath17 , with a growth rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass density of the background plasma .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the crcd instability has been studied making use of both mhd and particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "the mhd studies @xcite have shown a substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field and the formation of turbulence , which is characterized by prominent density fluctuations in the plasma .",
    "they have established a saturation criterion that depends on the wavelength , @xmath20 , of each mode and that is given by @xmath21 .",
    "this saturation criterion would imply that , if @xmath22 is constant , the field never stops growing but only migrates into longer wavelengths .",
    "this migration would be such that the dominant wavelength , @xmath0 , goes roughly as @xmath23 , where b is the mean value of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the saturation in mhd simulations with constant cr current is either not observed @xcite or is due to the size of magnetic fluctuations reaching the size of the box @xcite .",
    "one important limitation of the mhd simulations is that they can not follow the instability at arbitrarily low densities , which makes it difficult to model large plasma density fluctuations properly .",
    "also , the mhd simulations do not include the back - reaction on the crs , which must play a fundamental role in the saturation of the instability .",
    "both difficulties can be potentially resolved by fully kinetic pic simulations .",
    "a first attempt to use pic simulations for this problem was made by @xcite .",
    "even though their results show magnetic amplification , it accurs at a significantly lower rate and through a kind of turbulence that essentially differs from the circularly polarized , growing waves predicted by @xcite .",
    "this raised a question about the existence of the crcd instability beyond the mhd approximation .    in this work",
    "we confirm the existence of the crcd instability using pic simulations and establish the conditions under which it is present . in order to understand the saturation mechanisms of the instability , we separate our study in three parts , presented in  [ sec : thewaves ] ,  [ sec : multidimensional ] , and  [ freecrs ] . in  [ sec : thewaves ] , we show the main non - linear properties of the crcd waves , focusing on their intrinsic saturation mechanism in the presence of constant cr current , @xmath13 .",
    "we do this using an one - dimensional , analytic model , and check our results with one - dimensional pic simulations .",
    "we calculate a non - linear dispersion relation that includes the time evolution of the phase velocity of the waves .",
    "also , our model quantifies all the plasma motions induced by the waves , which is needed to understand the wave behavior in the multidimensional context . in  [ sec : multidimensional ] , we present the multidimensional properties of the instability using two- and three - dimensional simulations , also with constant @xmath13 .",
    "first , we determine the conditions under which the crcd instability can grow without being affected by plasma filamentation as in the case of @xcite .",
    "then , combining the multidimensional simulations with our results from  [ sec : thewaves ] , we determine the main properties of the instability in its non - linear stage .",
    "we confirm the generation of turbulence as suggested by previous mhd studies , and reexamine its main properties .",
    "we estimate the typical turbulence velocity and length scale as a function of the magnetic amplification , finding a faster migration to longer wavelengths than predicted by mhd simulations . we find that the acceleration of background plasma along the direction of motion of the crs causes the intrinsic saturation of the crcd instability at constant @xmath13 . in  [ freecrs ] , we study the effect of the back - reaction on the crs as a second saturation mechanism for the instability .  [ conclusions ] presents our conclusions and an application to the case of snr environments .",
    "in this section we present the one - dimensional analysis of the crcd waves at constant @xmath13 , i.e. , without considering the back - reaction on the crs . in  2.1 we show an analytic , kinetic model for the crcd waves , valid in the non - linear regime . after that",
    ", in  2.2 , we check our model making use of one - dimensional pic simulations .",
    "we consider a piece of upstream plasma through which positively charged crs flow , providing the current @xmath13 .",
    "we focus on the situation where the initial magnetic field @xmath7 , @xmath13 , and the wave vector of the crcd mode @xmath24 , are parallel .",
    "local charge neutrality is assumed as initial condition , so @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 correspond to the density of ions , electrons , and crs , respectively .      in this section",
    "we study the time evolution of crcd waves of different wavevectors @xmath24 , which are characterized by their growth rate @xmath29 and phase velocity @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the derivation is made for a right - handed polarized wave , and is based on the calculation of the drift velocities of plasma components in the presence of a wave of arbitrary amplitude .",
    "if we know these drift velocities and the number densities of the different species , we can calculate the total current provided by the background plasma as a function of space and time . adding this total plasma current to the constant @xmath13 contributed by the crs",
    ", the time evolution of the wave can be directly obtained from the ampere s and faraday s laws .",
    "the details of the calculation are presented in appendix [ app : analytic ] . here",
    "we describe its main results , which are summarized in the dispersion relation given by equation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "this dispersion relation assumes a constant @xmath29 and allows @xmath30 to evolve in time .",
    "we will see below that @xmath29 is indeed constant as long as @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the alfvn velocity of the backgroud plasma .",
    "this condition not only puts a limit to the validity of the derivation , but also sets a saturation criterion for the crcd waves .",
    "also , our derivation is in the low plasma temperature limit and assumes that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial alfvn velocity of the plasma . using two - dimensional pic simulations",
    ", we show below that this second condition is actually a requirement for the crcd waves not to be quenched by weibel - like plasma filamentation . from the real part of equation ( [ eq : dispersion ] )",
    ", we see that the growth rate , @xmath29 , is maximized when the wavenumber @xmath35 , which corresponds to the same wavenumber of maximum growth found in the linear regime @xcite . from the imaginary part , we obtain the following differential equation for @xmath36 as a function of the amplification factor of the waves , @xmath37 ( defined as the ratio between the magnitude of the transverse magnetic field , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 the solution for equation ( [ eq : diferencial ] ) is @xmath41 which , when @xmath42 , can be approximated as @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that , although in the linear regime the crcd waves are almost purely growing ( @xmath44 ) , if @xmath45 gets close to @xmath3 , their phase velocity can also become comparable to @xmath3 .    taking the real part of equation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) and evaluating at @xmath46",
    ", we obtain that @xmath47 where we have kept terms only to first order in @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we see that in the regime @xmath50 , the instability grows exponentially with a maximum growth rate , @xmath51 that is constant and has the same value as obtained in the previous linear studies @xcite .",
    "even though equation ( [ eq : growthrate ] ) shows that our assumption of constant @xmath52 is only valid when @xmath50 , it also indicates that , as @xmath45 approaches @xmath3 , the growth rate will be substantially reduced , suggesting an intrinsic saturation limit for the crcd waves at @xmath53 .    in appendix",
    "[ app : analytic ] we also show that the presence of the crcd waves induces bulk motions of the plasma particles both parallel and transverse to @xmath13 .",
    "the parallel motion has a velocity @xmath54 , while the transverse motion has a velocity @xmath55 , which always points perpendicular to @xmath15 ( and to @xmath13 ) .",
    "the parallel plasma motion implies that , when @xmath53 , the entire plasma will move at a speed close to @xmath3 , which , from the point of view of the plasma , substantially reduces @xmath13 .",
    "this reduction in @xmath13 explains the intrinsic saturation of the waves at @xmath53 .",
    "the tranverse motion , on the other hand , becomes of the order of the alfvn velocity of the plasma when the crcd waves become non - linear ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we will see below that this increasing transverse velocity is related to turbulence formation in the non - linear regime .",
    "we checked our analytical results with one - dimensional pic simulations .",
    "we use the pic code tristan - mp @xcite , which can run in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "in these simulations , like in our analytic model , all plasma properties depend only on one spatial direction ( @xmath57 ) , but both the velocities of the particles and the electromagnetic fields keep their three - dimensional components .",
    "we set up a periodic box that contains an initially cold background plasma ( with typical particle thermal velocity of @xmath58 ) composed of ions and electrons , and a small population of relativistic ions ( crs ) .",
    "the driving current is given by the crs that move along @xmath59 with a mean velocity @xmath3 that we vary between runs .",
    "these crs are not allowed to change their velocities , as if they had an infinite lorentz factor , @xmath60 .",
    "such  locked \" crs allow us to study the non - linear evolution of the instability considering a constant @xmath13 , i.e. , eliminating the back - reaction on the crs .",
    "we give electrons a small velocity along @xmath59 such that the background plasma carries a current @xmath61 .",
    "this way the net current is zero .",
    "the initial magnetic field , @xmath7 also points along @xmath59 .",
    "since we want to simulate a situation where @xmath62 , having good cr statistics would imply a large number of particles per cell . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we have initialized the same number of macroparticles for crs , ions , and electrons , but modified their charges so that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "we change the mass of the particles accordingly in order to keep the right charge to mass ratios .",
    "particles are initially located randomly in the box such that at the position of each ion we also have an electron and a cr , so the initial charge density is zero .",
    "this initialization is also used in our two- and three - dimensional runs .",
    "the common numerical parameters for the simulations are @xmath66 @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath67 is the grid cell size ) , ion - electron mass ratio @xmath69 , speed of light @xmath70 @xmath67/@xmath71 ( where @xmath71 is the time step ) , and 12.5 particles per species per cell .      here",
    "we test the non - linear dispersion relation found in  [ sec : analytical ] in the relativistic regime ( @xmath72 ) , which would be appropriate for the upstream medium of a relativistic shock front .",

    "as an initial condition we used a right - handed , circularly polarized , growing wave of amplitude 0.1@xmath74 , whose fields and particle velocities were determined from our analytic model ( appendix [ app : analytic ] ) .",
    "we put only one period of the wave in a box , so that the only other modes that could be excited are shorter or equal to @xmath75 .",
    "we choose the density of crs such that the corresponding maximum growth rate of the instability , @xmath52 , is 0.2 @xmath76 , so we are in the regime where the background plasma is well magnetized .",
    "simulations were run for @xmath20 equal to 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 1.25 , 1.5 , 2 , and 3@xmath77 .",
    "we used several values for the initial alfvn velocities , @xmath78 , in the range @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that the initial gyrotime @xmath81 ranges from 189 to 1456 @xmath71 , so it is resolved with about 20 @xmath71 even when @xmath1 , and @xmath82 ranges from 1 to 8 .",

    "[ fg : figura1 ] .",
    "we observe that for @xmath84 there is practically no growth . for @xmath85 1 , 1.25 , and 1.5@xmath77 we obtain nearly the same growth rate , which is very close to the analytic @xmath52 . for longer wavelengths , the growth rate gradually decreases . in all our experiments , for @xmath86",

    ", we expect the cr energy density to be low enough so that the maximum crcd amplification is determined by the back - reaction on the crs . in order to make an estimate of typical magnetic amplification in these environments ,",
    "let us consider a piece of upstream whose distance from the shock is such that it can only feel the most energetic crs that escape from the remnant .",
    "we use only the most energetic particles because they are the only ones whose larmor radii are much larger than the typical wavelength of the crcd waves , which is an essential condition of the instability .",
    "also , our estimate is based on the following assumptions .",

    "we see that , even though run - away crs can significantly amplify the ambient magnetic field , the upstream amplification alone is not enough to explain the factors of @xmath222 inferred from observations of forward shocks in young snrs @xcite .",
    "also , note that , if @xmath223 and @xmath224 , the distance swept by the shock in a time @xmath215 is @xmath225 , which is comparable to the typical size of a snr .",
    "this means that the advection of the upstream fluid into the shock may happen faster than the growth of the field , and may put further restrictions on the amplification .",
    "it has been suggested that a further crcd amplification could be provided by the current of lower energy crs that are confined closer to the shock and move diffusively at drift velocity @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "we believe , however , that this possibility requires a more detailed study .",
    "such lower energy crs can be magnetized in the sense that their larmor radii are smaller than the typical size of magnetic fluctuations , @xmath0 , violating the conditions for the crcd instability .",
    "although on large scales these crs will still produce a current of magnitude @xmath227 parallel to the shock normal , on scales of the crcd wavelength the local cr current may get significantly affected by the amplified field because of the deflection of crs .",
    "field amplification may then proceed in essentially different way .",
    "the magnetization of crs could be less of an issue if the wavelength of the instability due to low energy crs is shorter than the cr larmor radius .",
    "indeed , since lower energy crs are more numerous than the most energetic ones , their larger current will generate shorter crcd waves ( remember that @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , the crcd turbulence generated further upstream by the highest energy crs may modify the condition @xmath228 and may suppress the growth of the small wavelength modes closer to the shock .",
    "this suggests that other non - linear mechanisms , such as the cyclotron resonance of crs with alfvn waves @xcite , may still be important components in the amplification of the field .",
    "the full effect of the low - energy cr contribution needs to be investigated using a fully kinetic treatment of crs that includes their reacceleration by the shock , the presence of pre - existing turbulence , and the eventual contribution of cr electrons to the cancelation of ion current .",
    "although we have applied our results only to the non - relativistic case of snrs ( @xmath205 ) , the crcd instability may also play an important role in relativistic shocks in jets and gamma ray bursts , where @xmath72 .",
    "our simulations show that , at constant cr current , the evolution of the instability is the same as in the non - relativistic case . in particular , the intrinsic saturation criterion due to",
    "plasma acceleration is valid , implying a maximum magnetic fiel such that @xmath229 .",
    "however , if the back - reaction on the crs is considered , the non - linear evolution of the field and the saturation due to cr deflection may be dominated by cr beam filamentation @xcite . also , since in the upstream of grb shocks the density of crs might be close to the density of upstream ions @xcite , the magnetization requirement ( @xmath113 ) may not be satisfied in these environments . in this case , a non - linear magnetic amplification is still expected , but through an instability that is characterized by weibel - like filamentation of the plasma and whose properties may be different to the crcd instability described here @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the relativistic shock case in application to grbs will be presented elsewhere .    in conclusion , we have shown that the crcd instability is a viable mechanism for the non - linear amplification of magnetic field upstream of both non - relativistic and relativistic shocks , and that it can provide an efficient scattering mechanism for crs in these environments .",

    "we will use these results here in order to check the consistency of assuming that @xmath29 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244/dt^n)/(d^{(n-1)}[\\omega]/dt^{(n-1)})$ ] are constant and much smaller than @xmath76 , which are necessary for neglecting @xmath296 when @xmath297 .",
    "we know from equation ( [ eq : phasevelocity ] ) that when @xmath50 , @xmath43 .",
    "it means that @xmath298/dt^n)/ ( d^{(n-1)}[\\omega]/dt^{(n-1 ) } )   \\approx 2\\gamma$ ] ( except when @xmath299 and @xmath300 , in which case @xmath298/dt^n)/ ( d^{(n-1)}[\\omega]/dt^{(n-1 ) } )   \\ll \\gamma$ ] ) .",
    "so , in order to neglect @xmath296 for @xmath297 , we only require @xmath29 and @xmath243 to be constant and much smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "it is possible to show from equation ( [ eq : growthrate ] ) that the first condition , which is equivalent to @xmath113 , where @xmath52 is given by equation ( [ eq : growthrate ] ) , is satified if @xmath250 . from equation ( [ eq : phasevelocity ] )",
    "we see that , if we approximate @xmath301 , @xmath302 becomes approximately equal to @xmath303 , which is also constant and much smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "this way we see that our analytical results are valid if the plasma is well magnetized in the sense that @xmath113 , which is equivalent to @xmath304 . using two - dimensional pic simulations , we show in  [ sec : magnetization ] that this condition is actually a requirement for the crcd not to be quenched by the weible - like filamentation .",
    "we saw in  [ sec : threed ] that , when multidimensional effects are considered , the dominant wavelength of the crcd instability , @xmath0 , grows according to equation ( [ eq : wavelength ] ) .",
    "this makes it numerically expensive to run three - dimensional simulations that could amplify the field substantially without making @xmath0 too close to the size of the simulation box , @xmath73 . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty , in this section we present the results of two - dimensional simulations whose @xmath73 is always bigger than @xmath0 . despite some artifacts related to the two - dimensional geometry , these simulations help us confirm the main results obtained from the three - dimensional analysis presented above .    figures [ fg : shocks1 ] , [ fg : shocks2 ] , and [ fg : shocks3 ] show the results at three different times ( @xmath305 , 9 , and 11 , respectively ) for one of the simulations ( run i4 of table [ table : interference ] ) , which corresponds to crs drifting at the speed of light and without considering their back - reaction .",
    "we see that initially the instability is produced independently in different regions of the simulation box ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : shocks1 ] ) . in this linear stage of evolution ,",
    "the waves produced in adjacent regions of space seem to grow without interfering with each other .",
    "however , when the waves become non - linear , strong density fluctuations appear on scales of a few @xmath77 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : shocks2 ] ) .",
    "the beginning of this stage is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : shocks2 ] .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "[ fg : shocks3 ] that the magnetic fluctuations get distorted and evolve into larger scales right after the density fluctuations and turbulence form .",
    "the formation of density fluctuations also affects the growth rate of the instability .",
    "[ fg : departure ] presents the magnetic energy evolution for the two - dimensional simulations i5 and i6 , whose @xmath91 and @xmath306 , respectively .",
    "the rest of their numerical parameters are specified in table [ table : interference ] .",
    "we see that , as in the three - dimensional case , the exponential growth stops shortly after @xmath151 .",
    "after that , the crcd instability grows at a lower rate , reaching saturation when @xmath53 .",
    "this result had already been obtained in the three - dimensional case , but in this case we allow the instability to evolve into larger scales as the magnetic field grows .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the formation of density fluctuations produces a clear differentiation between the @xmath170 and @xmath171 components of the field ( as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fg : shocks3 ] and [ fg : departure ] ) .",
    "this is because in the low density regions the plasma can not generate the return current necessary to compensate @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the uncompensated cr current produces a  toroidal \" magnetic field around the underdense regions that , in the two - dimensional case , manifests itself as an amplification of the out of the plane component of the field , @xmath102 .",
    "even though , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : shocks3 ] , both the  toroidal \" and the crcd field coexist , the two - dimensional simulations can still give us information about the point when the crcd instability stops amplifying the field .",

    "the differentiation between the @xmath170 and @xmath171 components of the field as well as the departure from exponential growth after @xmath151 can be seen for both runs .",
