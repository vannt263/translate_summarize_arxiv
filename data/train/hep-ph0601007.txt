    "spontaneously broken symmetry phases occur in high - energy and condensed matter physics by varying the temperature , density , or a parameter controlling the interaction . these include chiral and color broken symmetries in high - energy physics  ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as superconducting , and spin and charge density waves ordered phases in condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of these different physical systems depends in general on the compatibility of the different broken symmetries and usually is studied in the framework of the ginzburg - landau - wilson energy functional  @xcite .",
    "recently we have studied the phase diagram of a relativistic model with both chiral condensates and cooper pairs  @xcite , as well as a non - relativistic model with ferromagnetic superconductivity  @xcite . for ferromagnetic superconductors",
    "it is known  @xcite that for spatially inhomogeneous order parameters the ferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist in a small region of the phase diagram . in the context of relativistic field theory",
    "this has been recently studied by rajagopal s group  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a simple relativistic model in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions which combines the gross - neveu model  @xcite with a model for cooper pairs  @xcite , plus an interaction which splits the masses of the fermions .",
    "the symmetric version of this model has been discussed previously  @xcite , and exhibits ( at the mean - field level ) a phase diagram which mimics some of the features expected for qcd with two light flavors of quarks .",
    "the model has a well defined @xmath0 expansion and is asymptotically free so that it does not suffer from the cutoff dependencies of @xmath1 dimensional effective field theories considered by others  @xcite .",
    "the question we are addressing here is whether the splitting of the fermion masses can lead to phase coexistence in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "what we find is that no such phase coexistence occurs for static mean fields .",
    "the presence of finite temperature condensates in one spatial dimension violates the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite . nevertheless",
    ", witten has argued  @xcite that it is still meaningful to study the formation of such condensates to leading order in @xmath0 , as the large - n expansion can give qualitatively good understanding of the correlation functions , even when it gives the wrong phase transition behavior .",
    "the quality of the approximation should improve as we increase the number of spatial dimensions and the mean - field critical behavior becomes exact above 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "therefore , the 2-dimensional realization of the model presented in this paper is a `` toy '' model exhibiting some of the features expected to be true in 3 + 1 dimensions such as the restoration of the symmetry at high temperatures .",

    "the model is studied in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions within the leading order in large n approximation .",
    "we find that the phase diagram with two different masses is similar to the case when the masses are the same in that depending on the values of the two renormalized coupling constants one is always in one of three distinct phases .",
    "a generalization of this model to higher dimensions including the case of spatially inhomogeneous order parameters is under development .",
    "we expect that the results found here in 1 + 1 for homogeneous order parameters will persist in mean field regardless of the number of dimensions .",

    "these semi - classical methods display a kink - antikink crystal phase and it would be interesting to also perform such an analysis for the model of this paper . in 1 + 1 dimensions , semi - classical analyses such as those described by dashen , hasslacher and neveu  @xcite often gave exact answers for the s - matrix ( especially in exactly solvable models ) and include more information than the straight forward study of the effective potential in the large - n approximation .",
