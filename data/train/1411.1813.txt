    "@xcite did include the magnetic field effect in their 3-d sph simulation by adding a magnetic field pressure in the equation of state .",
    "however , evolution of magnetic field direction can not be inferred from their simulation .",
    "in fact , comparing the ambipolar diffusion timescale ( @xmath110 myr ) with the radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) shock formation ( @xmath1 0.05 - 0.08 myr ) and a brc formation time ( 0.1 - 0.5 myr ) , it is not difficult to see that magnetic field effect may not be able to produce significant influence generally to the dynamics of the brc because of the extremely low concentration of the ions / electrons in the main body of the brc .",
    "magnetic field may play a certain level of role in morphology formation of a brc .",
    "recently , @xcite did 3-d magnetohydrodynamic simulations and suggested that only a strong magnetic field could significantly alter the non - magnetized dynamics .",
    "more recently , @xcite modeled a photo - evaporating cloud , including the magnetic field effect , and suggested that the magnetic pressure might play an important role in the cloud density structure .",
    "it is obvious that the physical effects , particularly magnetic field , are not treated properly in simulations .",
    "thus , it is of crucial importance to obtain information on magnetic fields in and around brcs .",
    "wide - field near - infrared ( ir ) polarimetry is a good tool for measuring the magnetic field direction toward molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite made near - ir imaging polarimetry of molecular pillars with bright rims in m  16 .",
    "their polarization observations show that magnetic fields are aligned along some of the pillars in m  16 , probably due to the uv impact from its exciting stars , while the global magnetic structure around m  16 is quite different from this alignment",
    ". however , such measurements for magnetic field toward brcs are still rare .",
    "eighty - nine brcs associated with iras point sources were cataloged by @xcite and @xcite in the northern and southern hemispheres , and are referred to as the sfo objects in simbad .",
    "the levels of star formation of 45 brcs in the southern hemisphere were examined by @xcite with co and mid - infrared data as well as the radio continuum data of @xcite .",
    "they identified 24 out of them that show strong interaction with hii regions .",
    "we started a systematic study of these brcs , and have so far examined the magnetic fields toward 8 brcs by making a single field observation ( @xmath17@xmath3 ) of near - ir polarimetry for each brc . in the course of this study , we found that the magnetic field of sfo  74 was most clearly revealed among these 8 brcs .",
    "thus , in this paper we report the results by adding three more fields around its head field ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "we estimated the relatively weak uv photon flux of @xmath14.5@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 , assuming @xmath115 pc apart from o6 v star @xcite , nearly the same as that by @xcite . in the head of sfo  74 , iras  14159 - 6111 point source ( msx  g313.2850 - 00.3350 ) is located , where @xcite reported presence of an ultracompact hii ( uchii ) region .",

    "* ) by focusing on just its brighter tip part .",
    "as seen in the supercosmos h@xmath8 image @xcite of figure [ fig1]a , however , its entire shape seems to be type b ( tightly curved rim ) rather than type a. this shape appears to be symmetric with respect to the uv incident direction from the exciting stars , so it is very likely that this shape was formed by uv radiation , i.e. , the rdi effect by massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on the results of our near - ir polarization measurements of sfo  74 , including those of the co archival data . in section 2 , we describe our near - ir observations and co archival data . in section 3 , we present the results of the polarimetry and co data . in section 4 ,",

    "the consistency of the polarization angles and degrees were checked among data taken for these two years runs in 2013 and 2014 ( see appendix a ) .",

    "as seen in this color - color diagram , most of the detected sources seem to be giants or reddened giants . here",
    ", we adopted the reddening line of @xmath44 1.95 @xcite , because this value seems to fit to the distribution of the reddened sources in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we regard the polarization of these point sources as the polarization of the dichroic origin , and assume the polarization vector to represent the direction of the local magnetic field averaged over the line of sight to the source .",
    "we made polarization degree @xmath32 versus @xmath43 color diagrams for point sources with the polarization measurement errors of @xmath40 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath20-band panel we include only the sources detected at all three bands , but for the @xmath21- and @xmath14-band panels the sources detected both at @xmath21 and @xmath14 bands .",
    "we obtained the best fit linear lines @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) assuming the intrinsic color @xmath48 @xmath490.15 of background sources based on the model calculations by @xcite .",
    "as @xcite mentioned , all of the observed near - ir polarizations are not originated by interstellar polarization , i.e. , there are highly polarized sources that can not be explained by interstellar origin , but by their circumstellar structures such as disks and envelopes . in order to exclude the point sources with large polarization degrees that are not considered to be of dichroic origin , we set an upper limit for the interstellar polarization . on the other hand ,",
    "if the source has intrinsic polarization or background polarization that had occurred in the more distant area , and if its polarization direction is different from that of the local magnetic field of interest , its polarization degree might become small .",
    "we also set a lower limit to exclude such sources . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the slopes of the dashed lines of each panel are double and one - half of the slope of the best fit linear line , and most of the plotted sources lie between these two dashed lines .",
    "therefore , we adopted them as the upper and lower limits of the polarization efficiency .",
    "only the sources between the two limits and of @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath51 , were used for plotting polarization vectors .",
    "we can see a clump of stars located blueward of each adopted upper limit line in figure [ fig3 ] , e.g. , the one located at @xmath52 on the @xmath21-band panel .",
    "most stars of the clump are visible in the optical image , so they are likely to be foreground dwarfs , and contain no information on the magnetic field of sfo  74 .",
    "thus , the clump indicates small foreground polarization at @xmath21 , so we safely excluded these clumps from the sample .",
    "figure [ j - pol ] shows a @xmath20-band polarization vector map superposed on the supercosmos h@xmath53 image of sfo  74 .",
    "sfo  74 is clearly visible in optical , so polarization as well as extinction is mostly caused by the cloud or background , not foreground interstellar medium .    in figure [ j - pol ] ,",
    "the magnetic field directions inside the cloud seem different from that outside of the cloud ( toward the northern , western and southern edges ) .",
    "we constructed the histograms of p.a .",
    "for @xmath20- , @xmath21- and @xmath14-band polarization vectors over the entire observed area ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "these histograms have a peak of @xmath195@xmath10 in p.a . , indicating the direction of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the longer the observed wavelength is , the clearer this peak becomes .",
    "this is because that the extinction , i.e. , the polarization degree , decreases at longer wavelengths .",
    "then , most of the polarization angles at @xmath21 and @xmath14 are likely indicating the direction of the background magnetic field .    inside the cloud ,",
    "the polarization vectors follow two patterns ; the polarization vectors 1 ) following the curved bright rim just behind the bright rim and 2 ) being parallel to an approximate symmetry axis of the cloud in the area away from the tip bright rim . as the symmetry axis ,",
    "we adopt an extension of the line ( purple solid line in figure [ j - pol ] ) connecting the position of hd  124314 and the middle point of the tip bright rim of the cloud ( dashed line in figure [ j - pol ] ) .",
    "these patterns of the magnetic field configuration are even clearer in figure [ hk - pol ] , showing @xmath21- and @xmath14-band polarization vector maps toward the head region of sfo  74 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the change of p.a.s of @xmath21-band polarization along the symmetric axis .",
    "we used the sources within the white dashed box in figure [ fig7]a , and the horizontal axis of figure [ fig7]b represents a position ( @xmath54 ) from the tip bright rim , where the position direction is the tail side of the cloud . in a range of @xmath55-@xmath56 , an average of p.a .",
    "is @xmath193@xmath10 , which is identical to the direction of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the p.a.s in the tip region just behind the bright rim ( @xmath57 0 - 2@xmath58 ) seem to scatter around 140@xmath10 , and their average is @xmath1141 , nearly perpendicular to the incident direction of uv radiation , @xmath160@xmath10 . in a range of @xmath57 2 - 4@xmath58 , p.a.s decline drastically from @xmath1141@xmath10 to @xmath170@xmath10 . in @xmath57",
    "4 - 6@xmath58 , an average of p.a .",
    "is @xmath168@xmath10 , being nearly parallel to the symmetric axis with some scatter . in @xmath57 6 - 9@xmath58 ,",
    "p.a.s gradually increase from @xmath170@xmath10 to @xmath190@xmath10 and keep constant around @xmath190@xmath10 thereafter . in @xmath599@xmath58 ,",
    "most of p.a.s seem to show around @xmath190@xmath10 , being close to that of the ambient magnetic field , although there is certain number of sources with p.a .",

    "is calculated to be @xmath186@xmath10 in @xmath57 9 - 14@xmath58 , being different only by @xmath19@xmath10 relative to that of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "thus , this region with @xmath61 seems to be dominated by the background polarization component , while the region with @xmath57 0 - 6@xmath58 seems to be dominated by the cloud polarization one .",

    "the derived maximum @xmath64 is @xmath170 k , which suggests that the cloud temperature is much higher than that in typical dark clouds .",
    "the peak positions are slightly different between two maps ( figure [ fig9]a and [ fig9]b ) with a separation of @xmath11@xmath58 , and the peak in the @xmath71 map is closer to the tip bright rim .",
    "the iras source is not located toward the peak of the @xmath71 map or that of the @xmath16co integrated intensity map . in figure",
    "[ fig9]c , the velocity width is small in the area that elongated along / just behind the tip bright rim with an almost uniform value of @xmath11.4 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the velocity width increases with distance away from the tip bright rim , but eventually decreases .",

    "hereafter , we refer to the blue component of @xmath76 km s@xmath7 as cloud  a and to the red component of @xmath77 km s@xmath7 as cloud  b. the iras source is located toward cloud  b , and a bright mid - ir nebula of the spitzer image is also seen toward cloud  b. we believe that cloud  b is located at the near side of cloud  a because a dark area that may correspond to cloud  b is seen in the optical image ( figure [ fig11]b ) .",
    "the @xmath16co channel maps ( figure [ fig10 ] ) , show the mushroom structure consisting of the core and the ears. the part of the ears has higher redshifted velocity components with respect to the main velocity component of sfo  74 ( see the two panels of @xmath78 km s@xmath7 and @xmath79 km s@xmath7 ) .",

    "these represent that cloud  a is externally heated by the exciting stars of rcw  85 , and support the idea that rdi process has been going on .",
    "the magnetic field configuration must have been also affected by rdi . in the very early stage of rdi",
    ", the magnetic field lines of cloud  a might be the same as that of the ambient magnetic field .",
    "when the top layer gas is ionized by the uv radiation of the exciting stars of rcw  85 , a strong shock is induced by the ionizing / heating and propagates into the cloud .",
    "then the surface layer of the cloud gets strongly compressed , which causes a magnetic field line form an open loop as shown in figure [ mfc ] .",
    "the magnetic field line of the loop looks almost perpendicular to the uv radiation direction .",
    "the looped magnetic field lines in the condensed layer form a stream of fragment lines around the bright rim as seen from figure [ hk - pol ] . in section 4.3 ,",
    "we proof the magnetic pressure could further enhance this field line looping effect . with the further propagation into the cloud",
    ", although the shock becomes weaker , it continues driving the gas to converge toward the symmetric axis and eventually to form a dense core - tail structure of type b brc .",
    "farther from the bright rim , the shock effect decreases its effect on gas compression ( magnetic enhancement ) .",
    "we conclude that the magnetic field configuration of sfo  74 is a result of rdi .",
    "we try to estimate the physical quantities related to the magnetic fields in the two regions ; one is the tip region ( region  1 ) just behind the tip bright rim , and the other is the inside region ( region  2 ) on the cloud symmetric axis .",
    "region  1 and region  2 are shown by a red trapezoid and a green square , respectively on figure [ fig7]a . estimating the magnetic field strength with the cf @xcite method requires an area where the magnetic field is uniform . since the polarization vectors of region  1 appear to uniformly follow the curve of the tip bright rim ( figure [ hk - pol ] ) , we selected region  1 that is considered to be the compressed layer by rdi as discussed in section 4.1 . since the magnetic field of region  2 seems to be rather uniform as shown in section 3.2 , we selected region  2 so that its area is the same as that of region  1 , well outside cloud  b. the southwest half of region  2 is covered by the co observations , and we can crudely evaluate the velocity dispersion of region  2 . here , we use only the sources with @xmath21 and/or @xmath14 vectors on figure [ hk - pol ] .    for region  1 , we adopt a thick , uniform disk approximation and assume that we view this disk edge - on . in this case",

    "this result does not seem to match the simulation results of the non - magnetized clouds that the number density in the tip is expected to be by more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the area away from the tip ( e.g. figures 3 , 7 and 10 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , the simulation taking into account the magnetic pressure predicts a smaller difference of a factor of @xmath60 10 ( e.g. firgure 8 of * ? ? ? * ) , which is more consistent with our observations .",
    "@xcite also suggests flatter column density profiles in the magnetized cases than in the non - magnetized ones .",

    "then , removing the dispersion due to the measurement uncertainties of the polarization angles , we obtained the corrected dispersion @xmath101 of @xmath111@xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , and used this for estimating the magnetic field strength with the cf method .",

    "adopting the molecular weight @xmath1052.3 , we obtained @xmath10690 @xmath107 .    for region  2 , assuming that the direction of the magnetic field is uniform nearly along the symmetric axis , we obtained @xmath101 @xmath116@xmath102 for 41 sources in region  2 after removing the uncertainties .",

    "the @xmath16co velocity width toward the southwest half of region  2 appears to be @xmath1 1.4 - 1.9 km s@xmath7 , and to decrease with distance away from the southwest edge of region  2 along the symmetry axis .",
    "therefore , we adopted the velocity width of @xmath11.4 km s@xmath7 near the center of region  2 as a representative velocity width of region  2 , and obtained @xmath10630 @xmath107",
    ".    it should be noted that the polarization vector maps toward sfo  74 might be contaminated by the polarized sources lying foreground and/or background to the cloud .",
    "however , this effect is probably small toward the dense parts of the cloud , i.e. , region  1 and 2 , because 1 ) the sources far behind the cloud , which have already undergone large interstellar absorption at the far side of the cloud , would not be detectable with our criteria , and 2 ) the extinction of foreground dwarfs , which are located at @xmath108 ( figure 3 ) , is estimated to be @xmath109 @xmath1101.5 mag , adopting @xmath10.1 mag as the intrinsic color ( @xmath43 ) of the dwarfs and using the reddening law , @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "this extinction is much smaller than those of region 1 and 2 ( @xmath11223 and 17 mag ) .",
    "therefore , the contamination from the foreground and/or background interstellar polarization is negligibly small in region  1 and 2 .",
    "the magnetic field of region  2 might be also enhanced by the convergence flow with respect to the original magnetic field , while that of region  1 might be enhanced by the ionized front .",
    "the ratio of the magnetic field strength of region  1 to that of region  2 is derived to be @xmath1132 , implying that the magnetic field of region  1 has been more strongly enhanced .",
    "the cf method is considered to be a rough estimate of the magnetic field strength , and the derived strength might have a large uncertainty .",
    "however , we can still discuss the relative ratio of the derived magnetic field strengths because the physical parameters used were derived in the same way .",
    "the uncertainty in density is the largest , but we note that the magnetic field strength is proportional to the root of the density .",
    "we compare the magnetic pressure , @xmath114 , with the turbulent pressure , @xmath115 in region  1 .",
    "@xmath116 is calculated to be @xmath117 dyn @xmath6 , adopting @xmath10690 @xmath107 as @xmath118 .",
    "this estimated value would be the lower limit because the magnetic field may not be running perpendicular to the line of the sight . using 1-d velocity dispersion ( @xmath104 ) of @xmath10.64 km s@xmath7 , @xmath119 is @xmath120 dyn @xmath6 .",
    "these comparable estimated values imply that the magnetic pressure significantly contributes to the internal pressure , and that the total pressure is @xmath121 dyn @xmath6 . for region  2",
    ", we obtained @xmath122 dyn @xmath6 and @xmath123 dyn @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic pressure is estimated to be slightly smaller than the turbulent pressure in region  2 .",
    "then , we compare the total internal pressure in region  1 with the external pressure , i.e. , the radiation pressure @xmath124 and the post shock pressure by the ionization front .",
    "the maximum ionizing flux is @xmath125 @xmath6 s@xmath7 and the energy of an ionizing photon @xmath12613.6 ev . if we assume the maximum average energy of an ionizing photon @xmath127 ev ( in fact it is much lower than that ) , then we can find the upper limit of @xmath128 dyn @xmath6 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath124 is negligible . to estimate the post shock pressure , we assumed plausible physical quantities of @xmath129 a few @xmath130 @xmath88 and @xmath1318000 k for the number density and the temperature of the ionization front , respectively .",
    "we thus derived the external pressure of a few @xmath132 10@xmath133 dyn @xmath6 .",
    "this value is comparable to or slightly larger than the total internal pressure , and thus these two regions may be in an equilibrium state or in a weak overpressure state of the ionization front .",
    "if this is the case , we suggest that the magnetic field plays an important role in the pressure balance between these two regions and in the evolution of cloud  a.    the dynamical state of a magnetized cloud is measured by the ratio between the cloud mass ( @xmath134 ) and the magnetic flux ( @xmath135 ) , i.e. , the mass - to - flux ratio , which is given by @xmath136 for region 1 , where @xmath137 is the critical value for magnetic stability of the cloud ( @xmath138 ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we assume that the magnetic field is almost perpendicular to the line of sight , but that is not necessarily so .",
    "therefore , the actual magnetic field strength might be larger , and the net mass - to - flux ratios could be close to the critical value .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field is likely to play an important role in the cloud dynamics , such as the evolutional time scale of the cloud , and the density and the thickness of the compressed layer , and thus star formation in cloud  a. for region  2 , @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 , which is by a factor of @xmath12 larger than that in region  1 , and the turbulent pressure is dominant .      as seen in figure [ j - pol ]",
    ", the bright rim of sfo  74 appears to consist of two parts ; the tip facing the exciting star and the wings extending toward both tail sides ( figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "we briefly consider this flat - topped shape .",
    "the magnetic fields just behind the wing rims seem to run along the bright rims like that just behind the tip rim ( figure [ j - pol ] ) . the strength of magnetic field just behind the tip , however , could be larger than that just behind the wing .",
    "the layer just behind the tip rim is perpendicular to the incident uv direction and might be more powerfully compressed by the uv radiation than that just behind the wing rims , which are nearly parallel or oblique to the uv radiation .",
    "we speculate that this flat top shape is formed by the larger increase of the magnetic field strength just behind the tip .    as for the physical explanation of the flat - topped shape of sfo  74",
    ", we look at the magnetohydrodynamic equation of motion , which is one of the four astrophysical fluid equations , @xmath141 where all of symbols are of their conventional physical meaning , and the magnetic pressure tensor @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .    according figure [ fig7]b , the average magnetic field direction behind the tip has a p.a . of @xmath168@xmath10 , approximately parallel to the central symmetric line of sfo  74 and the uv radiation direction ( @xmath160@xmath10 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath144-axis is parallel the direction of the average magnetic field and uv radiation , and assume the field just behind the compressed surface layer of sfo  74 , the above equation becomes : @xmath145 where the deduced pressure tensor , @xmath146    we can see that the magnetic field increases the cloud pressure by an amount of @xmath147 in the elongation direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath54 and @xmath148 ) , but decreases the cloud pressure by the same amount in the parallel direction ( @xmath144 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the @xmath144 axis directional magnetic field b in sfo  74 makes the structure of the cloud stretch in the width direction perpendicular to the magnetic field line and contract in the parallel length direction .",
    "this effect further quashes the magnetic field line loops created by uv radiation induced shock , so that the loop lines looks around the bright rim .",
    "the strength of this magnetic effect increases with the local density due to a positive dependence of magnetic field b on number density .",
    "therefore a flatter bright tip rim than that in zero magnetic field case appears on the star facing side of sfo  74 .",
    "although our main focus in this paper is to investigate the physical properties of the head part of sfo  74 , we are also interested in deriving a reasonable picture on the development of the morphology of the two wing rim structure shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "as we analyzed above , the magnetic field line behind the region 1 part of the type b sfo  74 is much less effected by the shock , increase of the magnetic pressure along x - y direction expands the width of the tail section ( region  2 ) more and more efficiently toward the rear end of sfo  74 than in the head part , so that we see the gradually outward curved wing rim , and the magnetic field lines naturally parallel to the wing rim .",
    "however , the wildly curved - out part at the rear end of the wing rim might not be caused by the expansion effect of the z - directional magnetic field only , which might also be the result of the rocket effect induced by the photo - evaporation of the ionized gas @xcite . in order to reveal the actually morphological and physical evolution of sfo  74",
    ", we are preparing a 3-d simulation by fully treating the magnetic field ( miao et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig11 ] , the peak position of radio continuum with acta @xcite and the position of iras / msx point source are not located toward cloud  a , but cloud b. we did not see any sign of high - mass star formation from the spitzer composite image ( figure [ fig11]a ) , and of @xmath15co molecular outflow from the mopra data .",
    "thus , the star formation in cloud a may not be currently active .",
    "the 8 @xmath149 emission is considered to be dominated by pahs and useful for identifying a cavity wall of an hii region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no strong 8 @xmath149 emission is associated with cloud  a ( see green color in figure [ fig11]a ) , and the @xmath15co data suggests the external heating from the exciting star of rcw  85 .",
    "thus , we concluded that cloud  a was not strongly affected by the uchii region .",
    "in contrast to cloud  a , cloud  b has some signs of active star formation .",
    "so , we examine more closely star formation in cloud  b.    the exciting star of the uchii region is assigned to be a b1 type star from the radio flux , although it is unresolved spatially . in order to identify the exciting stars , we try to search for their near - ir counterparts within 60@xmath19 of the iras position , the uchii region and the brightest part of the 8 @xmath149 pah emission . in the @xmath21 versus @xmath43 diagram ( figure [ fig8]a )",
    ", we found five candidates responsible for the uchii region lying above the reddening line of b2 .",
    "we also made the color - color diagram for these sources ( figure [ fig8]b ) .",
    "these five sources are also marked on the three color composite and monochrome images ( figure [ fig8]c , d ) , and their properties are presented on table 1 .",
    "sources # 4 , and # 5 are located outside of the mid - ir nebula , while sources # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 lie within the brightest part of the nebula .",
    "sources # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 are likely to be embedded b1 , b2 , and b2 stars , that suffer extinction as large as @xmath109 @xmath140 , @xmath115 , and @xmath140 mag , respectively ( figure [ fig8]a , b ) .",
    "the position of source # 1 coincides quite well with that of the iras source .",
    "therefore , source # 1 is the most likely candidate responsible for current star formation activities such as the uchii region , pah emission , and far- to mid - infrared radiation .    in our near - ir image ( figure [ fig1]b )",
    ", a small stellar aggregation can be seen toward cloud  b. the center of this aggregation is only @xmath120  west of the iras position , and",
    "several stars of this aggregation indicate color - excess on the near - ir color - color diagram .",
    "it is likely that this is a small stellar cluster associated with the exciting star mentioned above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we made the near - ir imaging polarimetry toward sfo  74 .",
    "we found that the magnetic field runs along the bright rim in the layer just behind the bright rim , and that the whole magnetic field configuration as well as the whole shape is roughly symmetric with respect to the symmetric axis of the cloud .",
    "this configuration is most likely due to the uv radiation from the exciting star .",
    "we estimated the magnetic field strength of @xmath190 @xmath107 toward region  1 ( the tip region just behind the tip bright rim ) and @xmath130 @xmath107 toward region  2 ( the inside region on the cloud axis ) , implying that the magnetic field strength toward the compressed layer ( region  1 ) have been more enhanced by the uv radiation than region  2 .",
    "the magnetic pressure is roughly comparable to the turbulent pressure , and thus the magnetic field seems to make a significant contribution to the internal pressure in region  1 .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio is close to the critical value in region  1 , indicating the importance of the magnetic field in the dynamics here .",
    "we speculate that the flat - topped shape of sfo  74 is due to the increase of the magnetic field strength just behind the tip .",
    "since the number of observations that show clear magnetic field structures is still small , it is very important to make more polarimetric observations of brcs and to conduct 3-d mhd simulations in order to understand the magnetic field effect on the evolution of brcs .",

    "<S> we estimated the column and number densities in the two regions ( just inside and far inside the tip rim ) , and then derived the magnetic field strength , applying the chandrasekhar - fermi method . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated magnetic field strength just inside the tip rim , @xmath190 @xmath2 g , is stronger than that far inside , @xmath130 @xmath2 g . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the magnetic field strength just inside the tip rim is enhanced by the uv radiation induced shock . </S>",
    "<S> the shock increases the density within the top layer around the tip , and thus increases the strength of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic pressure seems to be comparable to the turbulent one just inside the tip rim , implying a significant contribution of the magnetic field to the total internal pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the mass - to - flux ratio was estimated to be close to the critical value just inside the tip rim . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the flat - topped bright rim of sfo  74 could be formed by the magnetic field effect . </S>"
