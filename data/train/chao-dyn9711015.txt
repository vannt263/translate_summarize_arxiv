    "quantum systems with classically chaotic counterparts possess unique characteristic features as summarized , e.g. , in @xcite . following the semiclassical approach ,",
    "one often relates quantum properties of a system to its classical motion , using for example a direct comparison of phase space portraits of the classical dynamics and wave function quasiprobability representations in the phase space ( via husimi or wigner functions ) @xcite . even in the case of globally chaotic dynamics ,",
    "individual unstable classical trajectories can be retraced by stationary quantum eigenfunctions which are  scarred \" by the classical solution @xcite . when the classical phase space is mixed - partially chaotic and partially regular - a similar separation into regular and irregular wavefunctions is possible in the quantum world @xcite .",
    "stable regions of phase space ( tori ) lend themselves to semiclassical ebk ( einstein - brillouin - keller ) quantization , yielding both the approximate eigenenergies and the corresponding wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are  irregular \" wavefunctions living in the region of chaotic classical motion .",
    "some of them can be associated with residual structures of classically regular motion such as cantori while the other are practically structureless . in low - dimensional systems , kam ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser ) tori provide impenetrable borders ; the only way regular and irregular wave functions may communicate with each other is by quantum mechanical tunneling processes . in higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "classical arnold diffusion provides another mechanism of transport , a process which is , however , typically quite slow @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", quantum mechanical tunneling through impenetrable borders of classical mechanics may be quite effective .",
    "once the particle tunnels from , say , a stable island into the surrounding chaotic phase space , it can visit distant regions following the classically chaotic transport mechanism .",
    "in particular , it can tunnel into some other stable island thus providing the coupling between two wavefunctions localized on distinct and separated islands or it can wander very far away ( possibly leading , e.g. , to ionization as in atoms driven by external radiation ) .",
    "interestingly , this `` chaos assisted '' tunneling mechanism posseses unique features typically absent in the standard `` barrier '' tunneling of quantum mechanics , such as a great sensitivity to the variation of external parameters manifesting itself in fluctuations of observable quantities .",
    "previous work considered mainly model one - dimensional time dependent systems @xcite or model two - dimensional autonomous systems @xcite .",
    "a similar problem in the scattering case has also been discussed on a kicked model system @xcite .",
    "we shall consider here a realistic , experimentally accessible ( although simplified , see below ) system - namely the hydrogen atom illuminated by microwave radiation .",
    "instead of considering tunneling between two regions ( tori ) mediated by the chaotic transport between them , we shall rather consider the single tunneling process out of the stable island .",
    "then the chaotic diffusion process will lead to ionization . while in the former case , the probability may flow periodically between two regions linked by the tunneling coupling , in our problem the process is irreversible and constitutes the mechanism of the decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains the description of the systems studied - the hydrogen atom in the field of a microwave radiation of either circular or linear polarization - and a general presentation of the ionization via chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "section iii presents a simple model for the description of the fluctuations present in the decay , catalized by chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "we present there the distribution of resonance widths and consider also the distribution of energy shifts of the single , initially localized state due to the coupling to other `` delocalized '' states , and , via these states , to the continuum .",
    "this theory is confronted with the numerical data obtained for the hydrogen atom in the field of microwave radiation of either circular or linear polarization in section iv .",
    "finally we present conclusions in section v while the appendix contains the details of the derivation of formulae presented in section iii .",
    "in order to obtain the simplest study of quantum transport through a chaotic sea , one should use an initial state as localized as possible in phase space as , for example , a minimum wave packet localized on a classical stable equilibrium point .",
    "unfortunately , in atomic systems , no stable equilibrium point of the electron outside the nucleus exists .",
    "a simple alternative is to use a nonlinear resonance between the internal motion of the electron and an external driving force .",
    "recently , interesting new objects have been proposed in the studies of hydrogen atoms illuminated by microwave radiation of either linear @xcite or circular @xcite polarization : the so called non - dispersive wave packets .",
    "the corresponding classical dynamics picture corresponds to the stable resonance island embedded in a chaotic sea . for",
    "the motion contained within the principal 1:1 resonance between the kepler frequency of the unperturbed rydberg electron and the frequency of the driving field , the frequency of the electronic motion is locked on the external microwave frequency .",
    "semiclassically , a wave packet localized on such a regular island will be confined to it modulo the exponentially decaying tails of the wavefunction which may extend into the chaotic region . in a quantum treatment ,",
    "one finds wave packets which are really single eigenstates of the atom dressed by the microwave field , i.e. single eigenstates of the corresponding floquet @xcite hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "they are localized in all spatial dimensions and propagate along the classical trajectory in the same way a classical particle would do . for a generic case ( e.g. linear polarization microwaves , or more generally , any time - periodically perturbed system @xcite ) , it undergoes periodic deformations which faithfully follow the change of shape of the resonance island over one period , repeating the same shape every period . only in the case of circular microwave polarization ,",
    "the shape of the wave packet eigenstate does not change .",
    "this is due to the fact that the time - dependence may be removed from the hamiltonian of the problem by a transformation to the frame rotating with the field @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , a finite @xmath0 value leads to quantum mechanical tunneling from the island to the chaotic sea surrounding it . then the electron gains energy from the driving field and eventually becomes ionized by a process classically known as chaotic diffusive ionization .",
    "since many different paths link the initial wave packet with the continuum , its ionization time ( or its reciprocal - the ionization rate or resonance width ) fluctuates strongly with the parameters of the problem , the microwave frequency , @xmath1 , or its amplitude , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these wave packets are ideally suited for a quantitative study of the ionization promoted by chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "let us consider first the conceptually simpler case of hydrogen atoms illuminated by a circularly polarized microwave ( cpm ) @xcite .",
    "the problem is fully three dimensional ; however , as it has been shown elsewhere @xcite , one can consider the quantum dynamics in the space restricted to the polarization plane of the microwave field .",
    "while this excludes possible excitations in the direction perpendicular to the polarization plane , the dynamics of the wave packets and their properties are qualitatively not affected by the reduced dimensionality @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall present results obtained within such a reduced two - dimensional ( 2d ) model .    the time - dependence of the hamiltonian describing the cpm ionization of h atoms is explicitely removed by transforming to the coordinate frame which corotates with the microwave field @xcite , where it reads ( in atomic units ) : @xmath3 with @xmath4 the angular momentum operator .    at the center of the principal resonance island between the kepler and the microwave frequency , a periodic orbit exists whose period exactly matches the period of the microwave . in the laboratory frame , this is a circular orbit with radius @xmath5 such that : @xmath6 we introduce the effective principal quantum number @xmath7 ( not necessarily an integer ) corresponding to this main resonance : @xmath8 due to the classical scaling of the coulomb problem @xcite , among the two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 only one is necessary to tune the dynamics classically .",
    "thus , we define quantities ( position and microwave electric field ) scaled with respect to @xmath7 : @xmath9 @xmath10 represents the ratio of the external microwave field to the coulomb field of the nucleus on the unpertubed resonant circular orbit .",
    "the classical dynamics depends only on this parameter .",
    "the scaled radius @xmath11 of the resonant circular orbit is the solution of the scaled equation : @xmath12    in the corotating frame , the resonant orbit corresponds to an equilibrium point .",
    "this point is stable if the dimensionless stability parameter @xmath13 is chosen in the interval @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "then , the existence of a wave packet localized in the vicinity of the fixed point is assured in the semiclassical limit .",
    "it appears in the rotating frame as a stationary eigenstate of the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hcirc ] ) , localized around the equilibrium point and in the laboratory frame as a localized wave packet following a circular trajectory without spreading .",
    "the energies of the wave packet eigenstates in the rotating frame are given ( in harmonic approximation around the stable fixed point ) by @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 the normal mode frequencies of the locally harmonic hamiltonian which confines the wave packet , and @xmath17 the number of quanta in these modes . in the following",
    ", we shall consider the ionization of the `` ground state '' wave packet corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "such a wave packet can be expanded over the usual atomic eigenstates .",
    "it is a coherent superposition of mainly circular states @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath19 is close to the resonance between atomic circular states with principal quantum numbers @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "thus these states are strongly coupled by the microwave field .",
    "it can be shown that , for such a frequency , the overlap of the wave packet state with circular states is , for a sufficiently high @xmath22 gaussian distributed with a maximum at @xmath7 and the width of the order of @xmath23 .    to find the wave packets numerically , we diagonalize the time - independent hamiltonian in the rotating frame , eq.([hcirc ] ) , in a sturmian basis @xcite .",
    "the so - called complex rotation method @xcite allows us to take exactly into account the coupling to the continuum .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of the technical details .",
    "let us mention here only that a diagonalization yields complex energies , @xmath24 , where the real parts @xmath25 are the positions of the resonances while the @xmath26 correspond to their widths , i.e. their ionization rates . in this approach , spontaneous emission from the wave packet eigenstates",
    "to lower lying states is neglected .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation as they are composed of mainly circular states which have very long spontaneous lifetimes , typically of the order of several millions periods . in all calculations discussed hereafter ,",
    "the decay of wave packet eigenstates is dominated by field induced ionization ( via chaos assisted tunneling ) and _ not _ by spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the present results are obtained from the diagonalization of matrices of size up to @xmath27 .",
    "we use the lanczos algorithm @xcite to extract few eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors in the vicinity of the energy predicted by the semiclassical expression , eq .",
    "( [ semicl ] ) .",
    "the wave packet eigenstate is then identified by its large overlap with the circular state with principal quantum number close to @xmath28 , and by its large dipole moment .",
    "typically , due to the accuracy of the semiclassical prediction , it is enough to extract few eigenvalues of the matrix . for our present purpose ,",
    "it is the _ deviation _ of the exact resonance position from the semiclassical prediction , and the _ ionization rate _ which are of great interest for us .    for our statistical analysis ,",
    "it is reasonable to collect the data , for a _ fixed _ classical dynamics , i.e. at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath10 value varying simultaneously @xmath1 and @xmath2 around some mean values .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanics does _ not _ preserve the classical scaling , the finite @xmath0 value introduces another scale into the problem - say the energy of the state or the number of photons necessary for the ionization .",
    "we shall see that this has important consequences for the characteristics of the ionization process ",
    "the statistical properties of the widths depend on @xmath7 .",
    "we shall present the numerical data for both circular and linear polarization of the driving field simultaneously .",
    "thus before presenting the data , we review the wave packet properties in linearly polarized microwaves ( lpm ) @xcite .      if the atom is irradiated by an electromagnetic field of linear polarization defining the @xmath29-axis , the angular momentum projection @xmath30 on the field axis is a good quantum number , due to the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian : @xmath31 one is therefore left with two spatial degrees of freedom and the explicit , time periodic dependence of the hamiltonian which can not be eliminated .",
    "however , the temporal periocicity of the problem ( for constant driving field amplitude @xmath2 ) allows for the application of the floquet theorem and the identification of the eigenfunctions @xmath32 of the atom _ in _ the field as solutions of the stationary floquet equation @xcite @xmath33 where spatial coordinates and time are treated now on an equal footing .",
    "the floquet theorem guarantees that the eigenfunctions @xmath32 are periodic with the period @xmath34 of the driving field , and form a complete basis of the problem .",
    "the floquet states are nothing but the `` dressed states '' of the atom in the field @xcite .",
    "again , when coulomb attraction and driving field amplitude become comparable , the classical dynamics of the rydberg electron turns chaotic and phase space is divided into regions of regular and irregular motion . at sufficiently large field amplitudes ,",
    "only the principal resonance between the driving frequency and the kepler motion is left as an ( elliptic ) island of regular motion in the chaotic sea @xcite . unlike the cpm case ,",
    "the stable periodic orbit at the center of the elliptic island is not characterized by a set of simple analytical expressions .",
    "however , the local oscillatory motion can be plugged into the form of a mathieu equation @xcite , the numerical solution of which provides good estimates of the energy of the quantum mechanical ground state and of the first excited states of the local hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the oscillator ground state is the wave packet eigenstate of the atom in the field and follows the classical , periodic evolution of the principal resonance island @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of the classical angular momentum and its projection on the symmetry axis , the wave packet may probe the coulomb singularity and consequently displays some transient dispersion which mimicks the acceleration of the classical particle at the aphelion @xcite .    since , in the lpm case , the numerical detection of the wave packet is less straightforward than for cpm , we restrict ourselves to the investigation of the hydrogen atom confined to one spatial dimension , along the field polarization axis . as the driving field amplitude is increased , it is this direction along which chaos is born in the full dynamics of the 3d atom @xcite , and therefore this approximation will be sufficient for our present purposes .",
    "the lpm case has the same scaling property than the cpm case : the classical dynamics depends only on the scaled field @xmath35 .",
    "numerically , the wave packets are identified by their large ( as compared to other nearby floquet states ) overlap with the state @xmath36 @xcite , which is resonantly coupled to its nearest neighbour @xmath37 by the driving frequency . similarly to the cpm case , the quasienergies @xmath25 and resonance widths @xmath26 of the wave packets are used for the statistical analysis .",
    "all data samples are characterized by a fixed value of the parameter @xmath10 , hence they correspond to the same structure of classical phase space . for a given value of @xmath10 , @xmath1 ( and ,",
    "accordingly , @xmath2 ) has been scanned to give @xmath38 eigenvalues per @xmath10 value .",
    "the typical behaviour of the wave packet ionization width versus the microwave frequency has already been presented in @xcite for a fixed microwave amplitude .",
    "it displays very strong fluctuations over several orders of magnitude for small changes of the frequency ( typically of the order of 1 part in 1000 ) .",
    "these fluctuations ",
    "although perfectly deterministic  look completely random and are strongly reminiscent of the universal conductance fluctuations observed in mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ionization width measures the rate at which an electron initially localized close to the stable resonant trajectory ionizes , i.e. escapes to infinity .",
    "in other words , the ionization width directly measures the conductance of the atomic system from the initial point to infinity . in the quantum language , the ionization width is due to the coupling ( via tunnel effect ) between the localized wave packet and states lying in the chaotic sea surrounding it . while the energy ( or quasi - energy in the lpm case ) of the wave packet is a smooth function of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath39 ( see eq .",
    "( [ semicl ] ) ) , the energies of the chaotic states display a complicated behaviour characterized by level repulsion and strong avoided crossings . by chance",
    ", it may happen that  for specific values of the parameters  there is a quasi - degeneracy between the wave packet eigenstate and a chaotic state .",
    "there , the two states are more efficiently coupled by tunneling and the ionization width of the wave packet eigenstate increases .",
    "this is the very origin of the observed fluctuations .",
    "simultaneously , the repulsion between the two states should slightly modify the energy ( real part of the complex eigenvalue ) of the wave packet state .",
    "a simple way of measuring this effect is to compute also the shift of the real part of the energy level with respect to its semiclassical position ( which does not exhibit the repulsion from a near - degenerate state ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we study the fluctuations for a fixed value of the classically scaling parameter @xmath10 versus @xmath40 exemplary ionization width and _ level shift _ fluctuations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] on a logarithmic scale for the cpm case .",
    "note that both quantities fluctuate over several orders of magnitude and that the widths are more sensitive to changes of @xmath7 .",
    "since the shifts can take both positive and negative values , the absolute value of shifts is plotted .",
    "importantly we must mention that the shifts plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and used later for the statistical analysis are not obtained directly from the difference between the resonance energy and the semiclassical prediction , eq .",
    "( [ semicl ] ) , as anticipated before .",
    "these differences show a bias  the average shift is non zero .",
    "it indicates that although eq .",
    "( [ semicl ] ) well predicts the wave packet energy ( to within a fraction of the mean level spacing ) , the remaining difference is not solely due to the fluctuations .",
    "there is a slowly varying part in it which most probably originates from the unharmonic corrections .",
    "the latter could be estimated ; however , since in the lpm case , we do not have any good semiclassical prediction , we find the fluctuating part of the shift in both cases by subtracting from the exact quantum energies the smooth background .",
    "the latter is obtained by a low order polynomial fit of the wave packet eigenenergies as a function of the parameter @xmath41    to describe the fluctuations _",
    "quantitatively _ , which is the main aim of this study , we calculate the statistical distributions of the ionization widths @xmath42 and of the energy shifts @xmath43 typical distributions are displayed as histograms on a double logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "the data are those of fig .",
    "the use of logarithmic scales is useful to show quantitatively the fluctuations over several orders of magnitudes .",
    "> from this figure , we immediately obtain the following qualitative conclusions :    * the distribution of energy shifts @xmath44 tends to a constant as @xmath45 * above some critical value , the distribution drops and decreases roughly algebraically with @xmath46 the slope is close to @xmath47 , indicating a @xmath48 behaviour . * finally , @xmath44 falls off abruptly above some value .",
    "* the distribution of ionization widths @xmath42 behaves algebraically with @xmath49 at small width , with a slope close to @xmath50 hence , the small widths are the most probable ones . * above some critical value , the distribution drops faster , roughly with a @xmath51 behaviour . * finally , similarly to the shift distribution , there is a final sharp cutoff .",
    "these conclusions are similar to the ones obtained in a slightly different physical situation , when two symmetric regular islands are coupled to a single chaotic sea ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete discussion of this physical situation ) .",
    "there , states lying on the regular islands appear in doublets with even / odd parities with respect to the discrete symmetry exchanging the two regular islands .",
    "the splitting of the doublet is a direct measure of the chaos assisted process where the particle tunnels from one regular island , then diffuses in the chaotic sea and finally tunnels to the other regular island .",
    "this process is very similar to the one studied in the present paper where the particle tunnels and then diffuses towards infinity .",
    "the splitting distribution observed in @xcite is indeed very similar to our shift distribution as explained below .",
    "in the following section , we propose a simple model - mainly based on physical ideas similar to those used in @xcite - which allows us to understand the properties of our shift and width distributions .",
    "we shall consider a simple statistical model amenable to an analytical treatment . despite its simplicity",
    ", we shall see that it is capable of describing quantitatively the fluctuations of resonance widths and shifts observed in the numerical analysis of the microwave ionization of hydrogen atoms .",
    "the model system is directly based on the understanding we have of the origin of the fluctuations and follows the idea already used in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider the wave packet eigenstate as coupled randomly to a set of chaotic states ( described by random matrix theory ) which are themselves randomly coupled to the atomic continuum .",
    "more precisely , our model consists of a single state @xmath52 ( representing a state localized on the elliptic island ) coupled ( weakly ) to the space of @xmath53 `` chaotic '' , irregular levels , which are close to @xmath52 in energy .",
    "the latter states are considered to be , strictly speaking , resonances rather than bound states due to the mechanism responsible for decay ( e.g. , the ionization of an atom ) .",
    "while we consider a single localized state in the model , there may be several other states localized on the same island .",
    "they will have typically much different energies and their mutual coupling via the chaotic states is negligible .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix may be represented as a @xmath54 matrix : @xmath55 where we have assumed that the energy of the localized state sets the zero of the energy scale .",
    "the first vector in the basis represents the localized state , the following @xmath53 ones the chaotic states . in the chaotic subspace , the statistical properties of the hamiltonian",
    "are well represented by a @xmath56 random matrix @xmath57 .",
    "we shall deal with problems with a preserved ( generalized ) time - reversal invariance ",
    "@xmath57 should belong , therefore , to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of real symmetric matrices  @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath57 are independent random gaussian variables : @xmath58 with the variance satisfying @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the mean level spacing between consecutive chaotic states close to energy 0 .    following a commonly accepted approach @xcite the coupling of the chaotic state to the continuum is introduced by the decay matrix : @xmath61 where the @xmath53 component real vector @xmath62 describes the coupling of the chaotic states to the continuum . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take this vector to be composed of gaussian distributed random numbers with vanishing mean and unit variance . the real coefficient",
    "@xmath63 measures the strength of the decay to the continuum .",
    "such a form implies that there is only one significant decay channel for chaotic states .",
    "this is far from obvious and , as discussed below , probably true only at relatively low field strength .",
    "when there are several open ionization channels , a convenient form of the decay matrix is  @xcite : @xmath64}\\rangle",
    "\\langle w^{[k]}| , \\label{gam}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 denotes the number of open channels ( degeneracy of the continuum ) and the @xmath53 component real vectors @xmath66}\\rangle $ ] describe the coupling of the chaotic states to channels @xmath67 .",
    "again , we take these vectors to be composed of gaussian distributed random numbers with vanishing mean and unit variance .",
    "the @xmath68 real coefficients measure the strength of the decay to continuum @xmath69 .    in a similar way , the ( real ) @xmath53-component vector @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) describes the coupling of the localized state @xmath52 to the chaotic states .",
    "each component of @xmath70 is taken as a gaussian distributed random number of zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the coefficient @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) is a measure of the strength of the coupling between the localized state and the chaotic subspace .",
    "if the coupling to the continuum is neglected @xmath72 , the model describes a single bound state randomly coupled to @xmath53 chaotic states .",
    "this is exactly the model succesfully used in  @xcite to describe the splitting of doublets induced by chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "the model has several free parameters : the mean level spacing between chaotic states , @xmath73 , the strength of the coupling with the ionization channel , @xmath63 , and the strength of the coupling to the localized state , @xmath71 .",
    "there is a trivial scaling law of the hamiltonian @xmath74 , eq .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) , which implies that , except for a global multiplicative factor , there are only two relevant dimensionless parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the model . for several open channels ,",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath75 and @xmath77    due to the interaction with ",
    "chaotic \" resonances , the state @xmath52 is not an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian @xmath74 , eq .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) .",
    "however , in most cases , the coupling to chaotic resonances is weak and the true eigenstate does not differ very much from @xmath78 this is the perturbative regime that we shall consider in the rest of this paper .",
    "this regime is obtained when the coupling is much smaller than the mean level spacing between chaotic states , i.e. : @xmath79    we will see below that this condition is always satisfied for the real physical system ( hydrogen atom + microwave field ) for the microwave fields studied in this paper . at very high field ,",
    "when the nondispersive wave packet is destroyed , this pertubative approximation should break down .",
    "the physical interpretation is clear : if eq .",
    "( [ pert1 ] ) is not satisfied , the localized state is spread over several eigenstates of @xmath74 and completely looses its identity .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that , in the perturbative regime , the localized state can be interpreted as a soliton weakly interacting with the background of chaotic states , but essentially keeping its shape when a parameter ( for example the microwave field strength ) is varied .    in the following",
    ", we will also assume that the ionization rates ( widths ) of the chaotic states are small compared to their mean level spacing , i.e. that the decay matrix @xmath80 , eq .  ( [ gam ] ) , can be considered as a pertubation .",
    "this implies : @xmath81 such a condition is not _",
    "strictly _ necessary , but it makes calculations simpler .",
    "physically , it means that the various chaotic resonances are isolated .",
    "this is a typical situation in our system - the ionization of an atom in the presence of microwave driving for not too strong microwave amplitudes .    with the above assumptions  motivated by the physics of the process studied  the shift and width of the localized state",
    "may be obtained using the lowest nonvanishing order of perturbation theory .",
    "such an approach is justified unless an accidental degeneracy between the localized state and one of the eigenstates of the matrix @xmath57 occurs .",
    "neglecting such degeneracies ( which only affect the tail of the distribution , see sec .",
    "iv.a below ) and performing an average over the random matrix ensemble defined by eq .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) makes it possible to extract the analytic expressions both for the distribution of shifts and for the distribution of widths .",
    "the details of the derivation are given in the appendix .",
    "we give here only the important results .",
    "the shift distribution is obtained along a similar way to leyvraz and ullmo @xcite and takes the form of a cauchy law @xmath82 with @xmath83 importantly , this result is independent of the degree of correlation among the eigenvalues of the @xmath57 matrix : the same result is obtained for an uncorrelated spectrum ( poisson - like distributed eigenvalues , physically corresponding to coupling of the localized state with a set of  regular \" states , instead of chaotic ones as in the model described above ) , a goe or a picket fence ( harmonic ocsillator ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "this cauchy distribution is the same than the one obtained @xcite in the absence of ionization .",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated for the width distribution . for poissonian",
    "distributed eigenvalues of @xmath57 ( uncorrelated spectrum ) , a similar cauchy distribution is obtained for the _ square root _ of the width , corresponding to the following distribution of widths ( see appendix ) : @xmath84 with @xmath85 for a matrix @xmath57 belonging to the goe , the distribution is slightly more complicated ( see appendix ) : @xmath86 with @xmath87 although it is distinct from eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) , it has in fact quite a similar shape , see fig .",
    "[ fig2.2 ] .",
    "in particular , if @xmath88 is rescaled by a global multiplicative factor of about 20% , it is almost indistinguishable from @xmath89 quite a large statistics is necessary to determine which of the two distributions is a correct one for a given data set ( see also next section ) .",
    "we can also obtain the distribution of widths for the chaotic states in the perturbative regime .",
    "this is the well - known  non - overlaping resonances \" regime  @xcite where the widths are distributed according to a porter - thomas distribution : @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the average width . for small @xmath49",
    ", @xmath92 diverges as @xmath93 while for large @xmath49 it decays exponentially .",
    "the exact expressions , eqs.([eqs]-[eqx2 ] ) , obtained in the perturbative regime , reproduce qualitatively most of the statistical distributions numerically observed for the shift and width of the nondispersive wave packet of the hydrogen atom in a microwave field , see fig .  [ fig2 ] . for the shift distribution @xmath94 the distribution is constant near @xmath95 and decays like @xmath96 at large @xmath97 .",
    "the only difference is the absence of the sharp cut - off in the perturbative expression .",
    "this can be easily understood : the large energy shifts correspond to quasi - degeneracies between the localized state and one specific chaotic state , i.e. to the immediate vicinity of an avoided crossing .",
    "there , the simple pertubative scheme breaks down and the actual shift remains finite as the perturbative expression diverges as the inverse of the unperturbed spacing between the chaotic and localized states hence , the actual distribution has to fall faster than the perturbative one at large shifts , as numerically observed .",
    "the width ( ionization rate ) distribution behaves similarly .",
    "both the initial @xmath98 regime and the following @xmath51 regime observed for the wave packet are well reproduced by the simple statistical model .",
    "again , the difference is the absence of the cut - off for very large widths .",
    "the reason is identical , namely the breakdown of the perturbative approximation .",
    "nevertheless , we can go beyond the perturbative scheme , using the statistical model described in the previous section , but calculating numerically the shift and width distribution .",

    "in addition to the perturbative analytical expression , eq.([eqx2 ] ) , we have also drawn the distribution expected when the states in the chaotic sea have eigenergies described by a poisson distribution rather than a goe one , eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) .",
    "both distributions are similar far from the origin and differ by about 20% at @xmath100 at first glance , it seems that the poisson curve agrees slightly better than the goe curve , which is somewhat surprising and not understood as chaotic motion surrounding the stable island suggests the choice of the goe .",
    "however , the deviation is at the border of statistical significance . in the double - logarithmic plot",
    ", we have also added the porter - thomas distribution , eq .",
    "( [ pt ] ) , which reproduces correctly the tail at large widths .",
    "it is remarkable that both the shift and the width distributions are so well reproduced by the random matrix model .",
    "this proves that our simple statistical model carries the essential part of the physics .",
    "the data presented are the first , as far as we know , manifestation of the chaos assisted tunneling process in a realistic , experimentally accessible systems .",
    "even if the perturbative expression , eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) , incorrectly describes the non - perturbative large width tail , it is clear that the initial @xmath93 decrease , similar to @xmath92 , eq .  ( [ pt ] ) , is followed by a regime of @xmath101 behaviour .",
    "the length of this @xmath101 behaviour provides an interesting information about the system . for strong coupling ,",
    "@xmath102 the localized state @xmath52 is strongly mixed with the chaotic state .",
    "thus , its width distribution would be the same as that of other resonance states , i.e. a porter - thomas distribution .",
    "hence , the @xmath101 part there shrinks to zero and the power @xmath103 law is followed immediately by the exponential tail .",
    "the relative importance of the @xmath101 part in the width distribution indicates , therefore , the presence of the weak coupling , perturbative regime . compared to the pure chaotic state where fluctuations of the widths are already known to be large , the effect of additional tunneling is to shift some part of the width distribution towards small widths while keeping the exponential cut - off , that is to increase the fluctuations . in the perturbative limit ,",
    "the fluctuations become so large that the average width _ diverges_.",
    "the success of the statistical model allows to give a complete physical interpretation of the observed data :    * the smallest shifts and widths , observed for @xmath104 with probabilities behaving , respectively , as @xmath105 and @xmath93 , correspond to the localized state lying far from quasi - degeneracies with one of the chaotic states .",
    "then , the localized state is weakly contaminated by the various surrouding chaotic levels .",
    "for example , its shift is the sum of the effect of level repulsion by the various chaotic states .",
    "chaotic states with higher ( resp .",
    "lower ) energy push the localized state down ( resp .",
    "up ) in energy , which globally results in a small shift with a random sign .",
    "the width results from the interference between the elementary ionization amplitudes contributed by the various chaotic states . as there is only one open decay channel , the amplitudes  not the probabilities",
    " have to be added . as they are essentially random uncorrelated variables , the interference is mainly destructive , producing small widths with a large probability . *",
    "the intermediate shifts and widths , observed for @xmath106 with probabilities behaving respectively as @xmath107 and @xmath101 , correspond to one chaotic state being much closer in energy to the localized state than to the other chaotic states , but nevertheless sufficiently far to be coupled only perturbatively .",
    "then , the single coupling to this particular chaotic state dominates both the shift and the width of the localized state . *",
    "the largest shifts and widths , observed for @xmath108 correspond to the quasi - degeneracy between the localized state and one chaotic state , with strong non - perturbative mixing between the two .",
    "this is where the exponentially decreasing tails are observed .    in the latter two cases , as one chaotic state",
    "is dominant , approximate expressions for the distributions can be obtained by a simple two - level model .",
    "although the expression of the shift and the width are then easy to obtain ( diagonalization of a @xmath109 complex matrix ) , we have not been able to perform analytically the averaging over the ensemble of random matrices .",
    "the simplest possible measures of the fluctuations of a quantity are typically its average value and the variance . inspection of the perturbative distributions for both the shifts , eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) , and the widths , eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) , suggests , however , some caution .",
    "indeed , the average value of the width is not defined ( the corresponding integral diverges ) and the same is true for the variance of the shift ( the average value is zero due to the symmetry of the distribution ) .",
    "this is because of the existence of long algebraic tails , @xmath96 and @xmath51 , in the distributions .",
    "the variance of the shift and the average value of the width are infinite because of the diverging contributions of these tails .",
    "this is an example of unusual random processes such as levy flights  @xcite where rare events play the dominant role .",
    "ultimately , it is because , in perturbation theory , the contamination of a state by its neighbors is proportional to the ratio of the coupling matrix element to the energy difference and consequently decreases slowly : even a far distant level can have a large effect .",
    "for the full non - perturbative distributions , the exponential cutoff at large values kills the divergence of the various integrals and average values and variances  as well as higher moments of the distributions  are well defined and could be calculated .",
    "their precise values , however , depend crucially on the position of the cutoffs .",
    "hence , distributions identical for small widths ( shifts ) and only differing at large widths ( shifts ) may have completely different average values and variances . calculating such quantities",
    "requires a very accurate knowledge of the tails of the distributions .",
    "the average values and the variances are thus fragile and difficult to calculate on a real system like the hydrogen atom in a microwave field ; they do not provide us with the most interesting physical information .    rather than the average values ,",
    "we prefer to define typical values .",
    "the typical width @xmath110 lies at the middle of the distribution , such that half of the widths are larger and half of them smaller , i.e. @xmath111 with such a definition , the typical width is robust , only weakly sensitive to the tail of the distribution .",
    "a similar definition holds for the typical shift , slightly modified to take into account that @xmath97 can be either positive or negative : @xmath112    for the perturbative distributions in the statistical random matrix model , the typical widths and shifts can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eqs]),([eqx]),([eqx2 ] ) : @xmath113 for the full non - perturbative random model distributions  as long as the basic hypothesis of small coupling , eqs .",
    "( [ pert1 ] ) and ( [ pert2 ] ) , are true ",
    "we carefully checked that the typical widths and shifts are not significantly ( within few tenths of percent ) different from the previous analytic expressions .    for a real physical system like the wave packets in the hydrogen atom exposed to a microwave field",
    ", we can reliably extract from the statistical data the typical width and shift .",
    "we have also compared the numerically obtained distributions with non - perturbative distributions of our statistical model and performed best fits of the former by the latter .",
    "again , we checked that the typical width and shift for the best fit do not differ by more than few tenths of percent from the direct measures .",
    "this implies that the typical shift and width can be safely used to extract from the statistical distributions the relevant physical parameters @xmath71 ( coupling between the localized state and the chaotic states ) and @xmath63 ( ionization widths of the chaotic states ) .",
    "slightly different values are obtained if the poisson or goe expressions are used . in the following ,",
    "we have used the goe expression .",
    "in fact , only @xmath114 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 ( from the ratio @xmath115 ) can be easily extracted .",
    "obtaining the other dimensionless parameter @xmath75 or @xmath71 and @xmath63 themselves requires to know the mean spacing @xmath73 between chaotic resonances .",
    "surprisingly , this is not straightforward . to understand the problem , consider the diagonalization of the floquet hamiltonian for the lpm case .",
    "the number of states present in a single floquet zone depends on the number of photon blocks included in the diagonalization . when it is increased , new states appear in the vicinity of the wave packet state corresponding to either low lying atomic states ( with very different energy but shifted upwards by an integer times the photon frequency ) or highly excited states or resonances ( shifted downwards ) .",
    "these states should not contribute to the determination of @xmath73 since they have a vanishing overlap with atomic states building the wave packet .",
    "hence , the mean level spacing @xmath73 between chaotic states is a somewhat ambiguous quantity .",
    "however  as will be seen at the beginning of the next section  all our results are obtained either in the perturbative regime @xmath116 or close to it , and the mean spacing @xmath73 is just a scaling parameter . a rough estimate of @xmath73 is obtained assuming that only states with similar principal quantum number , let us say differing by less than a factor 2 , are efficiently coupled .",
    "experimental results on hydrogen atoms in a linearly polarized microwave field @xcite suggest that the physics of ionization is entirely dominated by states with principal quantum number less than @xmath117 ( when the experimental cut - off is changed from infinity to @xmath117 , no important change is observed ) . at low microwave field ,",
    "the number of efficiently coupled states is smaller , but this is not the regime of chaotic diffusion we are interested in .",
    "chaotic motion requires overlap between classical resonance islands , i.e. efficient coupling between states of largely different principal quantum numbers .",
    "this gives the following approximate mean level spacing , used later in this paper :    @xmath118      fig .",

    "the statistical model described above makes it possible to separate the intrinsic huge fluctuations of the ionization rate and extract values of the various couplings .",

    "altogether , this proves that our data are effectively obtained in the perturbative regime .    the third observation in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is that neither the typical width , nor the typical shift are monotously increasing functions of the microwave field strength , but display various bumps .",

    "[ fig7 ] for the circular polarization , for a fixed scaled microwave field @xmath131 in this plot , the classical dynamics of the system is absolutely fixed , the only varying parameter being the effective planck s constant @xmath132 the striking phenomenon is the fast decrease of both the typical width and typical shift with @xmath41 in the logarithmic scale of fig .",

    "the situation then may not correspond to a clear - cut case of the chaos assisted tunneling process .",
    "our lpm data indicate that in such cases the singularity for small widths is much stronger than @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , in the cpm case , we did not present the random matrix fit for @xmath140 as a significant part of the data is affected there by a strong classical @xmath141 resonance @xcite .",
    "thus we do not face a clear case of a single localized state but rather two strongly coupled localized states decaying via a chaos assisted tunneling process .",
    "since such a case is quite rare , we prefer to exclude it from the analysis and not to construct the extension of the random matrix theory .",
    "it could not be tested convincingly on a single case , anyway .",

    "[ fig9 ] presents the histogram of the square root of the width for @xmath145 and shows the existence of at least two open channels .",
    "again the corresponding shift distribution is not affected and is well described by the cauchy distribution [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "we have presented a statistical theory of ionization catalyzed by chaos assisted tunneling .",
    "the corresponding physical picture is built of a single state , localized on a stable island and coupled ( quantum mechanically , due to a finite value of @xmath0 ) to the surrounding chaotic sea .",
    "once the tunneling into the sea takes place , the diffusive chaotic excitation leads finally to ionization .",
    "a random matrix theory model allows us to determine analytically the distribution of the energy shifts ( induced by the interaction with the chaotic sea ) of the localized state , as well as the distribution of its widths ( ionization rates ) , in the perturbative limit .",
    "non - perturbative corrections may also be understood and estimated .",
    "we concentrated on the simplest case of single channel ionization  the model then is characterized by few parameters only . in that case , both the distributions of shifts and widths have long algebraic tails explaining the large scale fluctuations of both quantities .",
    "these fluctuations are a characteristic feature of chaos assisted tunneling processes",
    ". fluctuations ( and universal properties of fluctuations ) are well established properties of chaotic systems . in the ionization brought about by chaos assisted tunneling , the combination of a weak tunneling process with chaotic coupling to the continuum increases dramatically the range of the fluctuations , by extending the distribution considerably towards extremely small widths , i.e. metastable states .",
    "the developed theory has been confronted with numerical data obtained for the shifts and widths of non - spreading wave packets  states localized on a stable 1:1 resonance island between the kepler frequency of a rydberg electron and the frequency of an externally applied microwave field of either linear or circular polarization  a system accessible to present experiments .",
    "the numerical data have been obtained for simplified models of the atom - a one - dimensional atom in lpm and a two - dimensional atom in cpm .",
    "this allowed us to study the frequency range well in the experimental region - the important atomic states building the wave packet correspond to the principal quantum numbers used in the experiments .",
    "the principal reason for the simplification is that fully three - dimensional numerical calculations  although possible for a single set of parameters as exemplified by us before @xcite  are still prohibitive for present day computers .",
    "more importantly , however , the statistical properties of non - spreading wave packet states are not affected by the reduced dimensionality of the atom as tested by us for the three - dimensional cpm case .",
    "it turns out that the developed statistical theory very well describes the numerical data in the range of the single channel decay , which makes us confident that it contains the essential ingredients of the physical process .",
    "the quality of the fits allows to extract order from chaos , that is to extract from strongly fluctuating quantities , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the physical parameters describing the coupling of the non - spreading wave packet to the chaotic states ( tunneling rate ) and the ionization rate of chaotic states .",
    "these parameters exhibit reasonably smooth behaviour .",
    "for example , we have shown that secondary classical resonances inside the regular island increase the tunneling rate . as an unambiguous signature of a tunneling process",
    "we also could demonstrate the exponential decrease of the tunneling rate with the principal quantum number .",
    "let us emphasize the importance of the fluctuations of the ionization rate ( width ) of non - spreading wave packets in the hydrogen atom .",
    "in a real experiment , it is likely that the atoms will experience various values of the microwave field strength  either because of spatial inhomogeneities or because they are prepared by a slow increase of the microwave strength as explained in @xcite  and more or less average the short range fluctuations of the ionization rate . in the total",
    ", the residual ionization of the atom will be given by the average ionization rate , a quantity dominated by the fluctuations towards large ionization rates and which can be significantly larger than the typical ionization rate .",
    "for example , for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] discussed in this paper , the average ionization rate is about 6.4 times larger than the typical ionization rate . in the limit of the perturbative regime ,",
    "the ratio of the two even diverges !",
    "this is an example of physical processes as levy flights where the physics of a fluctuating system is dominated by rare events .",
    "> from a practical point of view , the present study also tells us that the lifetimes of the non - spreading wave packets either in cpm or in lpm are rather long .",
    "indeed , for @xmath144 and @xmath146  these values are representative of what could be used in a real experiment , microwave frequency around 30 ghz and microwave field amplitude of the order of 10v / cm  the typical lifetime of the non - spreading wave packet in cpm , due to ionization catalyzed by chaos assisted tunneling , is of the order of several micro - seconds , that is about 100 000 kepler periods .",
    "however , fluctuations by one or two orders of magnitude are expected around this typical value .",
    "even the longest lifetimes should be shorter than the natural lifetime , due to spontaneous emission , of the order of a fraction of a second . at higher @xmath147 the typical ionization lifetime",
    "is of the order of several milliseconds , i.e. 10 million kepler periods , but still shorter than the lifetime induced by spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "hence , for practical experiments in cpm , spontaneous emission should not be a problem . in lpm ,",
    "spontaneous emission is a slightly stronger effect , but largely dominated by chaos assisted tunneling ionization for @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "finally , the physical situation and the model described here are not restricted to atomic non - spreading wave packets .",
    "it should describe physical systems where a given state is weakly coupled to a dense family of completely different other states which can decay on a rather long time scale .",
    "then , the effective decay rate of the initial state , induced by the coupling with the family of decaying states , should present huge fluctuations .",
    "an example is given in nuclear physics by the so - called super - deformed nuclei @xcite where the ground state of a super - deformed nucleus can only decay by coupling to highly excited ( hence chaotic ) states of the non - deformed nucleus .",

    "if this condition is not fulfilled , the localized state can not be assigned to a given eigenstate of the full @xmath74 matrix and the shift and width are ill - defined quantities . in the following , we thus consider the perturbative limit where both @xmath71 and @xmath63 are much smaller than @xmath149 typically , the localized state is then weakly coupled to the chaotic sea , itself weakly coupled to the continuum .",
    "it may happen that the localized state is accidentally almost degenerate with a chaotic eigenstate of @xmath150 bringing back the problem of assigning the strongly mixed state .",
    "however , this is a rare event which - as it is shown below - affects the tails of the distributions only . in the generic case , the couplings are weak and the energy shift and the width can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "there are two small parameters for the perturbative analysis , namely @xmath75 and @xmath151 at first order in these small parameters , there is no effect on the energy of the localized state ( no diagonal element ) .",
    "on the other hand , the localized state is contaminated at first order in @xmath75 by the chaotic states .",
    "the perturbed eigenstate @xmath152 can be written as : @xmath153 where @xmath52 denotes the unperturbed localized state and @xmath70 is the @xmath53-component vector describing the coupling of the localized state to the chaotic states .",
    "it can be also expanded on the eigenstates @xmath154 of @xmath57 with eigenvalues @xmath25 as : @xmath155 , given by : @xmath156    also , as the imaginary coupling @xmath157 , eqs .",
    "( [ mat1 ] ) and ( [ w ] ) , has non - zero diagonal elements , this implies a non - zero imaginary part of the energy at order @xmath158 more precisely a width given by : @xmath159 since @xmath49 appears as the square of a simpler quantity @xmath5 , i.e. : @xmath160 with @xmath5 given by : @xmath161 we will consider in the following the statistical distribution of @xmath5 rather than @xmath162    to obtain the statistical distributions within our random matrix model , one has to average over the random ensemble , i.e. over the various gaussian random variables : the @xmath53 components of @xmath163 , the @xmath53 components of @xmath164 and the @xmath165 independent matrix elements of @xmath166 because of the orthogonal invariance of @xmath150 the averaging over @xmath163 and @xmath164 is straightforward .",
    "thus , the distribution of shift is essentially the distribution of diagonal elements of @xmath167 while the distribution of @xmath5 ( square root of the width ) is essentially the distribution of matrix element of @xmath167 between two statistically independent vectors .",
    "since we are interested in the situation where a large number of chaotic states are coupled to the localized state , we will take the limit @xmath168 keeping the mean level spacing equal to a constant @xmath73 and keeping @xmath63 and @xmath71 fixed , such that the average coupling between a chaotic state and the localized state is independent of @xmath169 then , in the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ rmts ] ) and ( [ rmtx ] ) , there are more and more terms which contribute as @xmath53 is increased , but corresponding to larger and larger energy denominators @xmath170 so that the total sum has a well defined limit as @xmath171 yet , in this limit , the scalar product @xmath172 appears as the sum of the product of independent gaussian variables which typically averages to a small quantity . in other words , in the @xmath173 limit , @xmath163 and @xmath164 appear as independent orthogonal vectors , so that the distribution of @xmath5 values is essentially the distribution of non - diagonal elements of @xmath174 corrections due to non exact orthogonality will modify the distribution at order @xmath175 only .    the calculation of the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ rmts ] ) and ( [ rmtx ] ) is not completely straightforward , because the various energies in the denominators are _ correlated _ if @xmath57 is a goe random matrix . before studying this case ,",
    "let us consider the simpler case where the spectrum of @xmath57 is a set of _ uncorrelated _ eigenvalues , i.e. a poisson spectrum .",
    "then , all quantities in the numerators are uncorrelated random gaussian variables and denominators are uncorrelated energies with mean density @xmath176 in this case , the calculation can be done exactly as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and the distribution is a cauchy distribution whose half - width is proportional to the average absolute value of the numerator , that is : @xmath177 with @xmath178 where the bar denotes the average value over the random matrix ensemble . here",
    ", it is simply the variance of the components of @xmath70 , that is 1 in our model ( see section iii ) .",
    "hence , @xmath179    similarly , one gets @xmath180 with @xmath181 the average over the random ensemble ( gaussian integral ) gives a @xmath182 factor , resulting in : @xmath183 for the width itself , we obtain the distribution given in section iii , eq .",
    "( [ eqx ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the random matrix case , where @xmath57 is a standard real symmetric random matrix belonging to the goe ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  brouwer introduced a slightly different class of random matrices , namely the lorentzian orthogonal ensemble ( @xmath184oe ) which has the following lorentzian probability distribution : @xmath185 \\label{loe}\\ ] ] where @xmath186 is a parameter describing the width of the distribution .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the @xmath184oe has different global statistical properties ( as e.g. density of states ) than the goe , it has locally the same joint probability distribution function of the eigenvalues and consequently the same spacing distribution , the same short range correlation functions , etc .",
    "the mean level spacing close to the centre of the spectrum ( energy equal to zero ) is : @xmath187 hence , to calculate the shift and the width distribution , we can replace @xmath57 by a random matrix of the @xmath184oe .",
    "the @xmath184oe has the nice property @xcite that if @xmath57 is distributed according to @xmath184oe , then @xmath167 is also distributed according to @xmath184oe with width @xmath188 morevoer , if @xmath57 is distributed according to @xmath184oe , then every submatrix of @xmath57 is also distributed according to @xmath184oe , with the same width @xcite .",
    "the price to pay for such nice properties is that one looses the statistical independence of the various matrix elements valid for the goe , i.e. @xmath189 can not be factorized as a product of distributions of elementary matrix elements .",
    "however , this is not a problem for the quantities we are interested in .",
    "the distribution of shifts is obtained straightforwardly , as it is a diagonal element of @xmath167 , hence a @xmath190 submatrix of @xmath167 , which - from the two properties just described - is given by eq .",
    "( [ loe ] ) for @xmath191 and @xmath192 the result is exactly equal to the poisson result , i.e. the cauchy ( or lorentzian ) distribution of eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) .    for the width , the situation is slightly more complicated as we need to know the distribution of a non - diagonal element of @xmath174 the same trick works , but we have now to extract for the @xmath184oe matrix @xmath167 a @xmath109 submatrix and consider the distribution of non - diagonal element , that is to average over the 2 diagonal elements : @xmath193 where @xmath189 is given by eq .",
    "( [ loe ] ) for @xmath194 and @xmath192 the integral over diagonal elements is trivial .",
    "the result is the following distribution for the square root of the width : @xmath195 \\label{px}\\ ] ] with @xmath196 for the width itself , we obtain the distribution given in section iii , eq .",
    "( [ eqx2 ] ) .    the goe distribution , eq .",
    "( [ px ] ) has the same behaviour as the cauchy distribution obtained for the poisson ensemble , eq .",
    "( [ pxp ] ) , that is a constant value near @xmath197 followed by a @xmath198 decrease at large distance .",
    "in fact , the two distributions are very similar with slightly different widths and are almost impossible to distinguish by eye .",
    "note that the distributions obtained here have long tails with an algebraic decay as @xmath97 ( or @xmath5 ) tends to infinity .",
    "this is unusual for quantities which are sums of statistically uncorrelated individual terms and - as a consequence of the central limit theorem - have usually gaussian distributions .",
    "the reason is that the central limit theorem can not be used here because the variance of each individual term in infinite , see ref .",
    "the latter property is due to the @xmath170 dependence which decays only slowly for large @xmath199    on a double logarithmic scale , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the distribution of shifts shows two different regimes : constant near the origin , and an asymptotic @xmath96 behaviour for large shifts .",
    "the cross - over between the two regimes is for @xmath200 the latter value , eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) , corresponds to the typical shift due to a chaotic level lying at a distance @xmath73 from the localized state , i.e. to the typical shift due to the nearest state .",
    "hence , large energy shifts @xmath201 are due to situations where one chaotic level is much closer in energy than @xmath149 in such a case , one term is dominant in the sum , eq .  ( [ rmts ] ) , a two level approximation can be used , which produces the correct @xmath96 behaviour . on the other hand , the  constant \" regime , @xmath202 corresponds to situations where the various terms in eq .",
    "( [ rmts ] ) interfere destructively , giving a total sum typically smaller than the largest individual terms : this is an intrisically  multi - level \" situation where quantum destructive interferences play an important role .",
    "exactly the same thing takes place for the distribution of widths .",
    "the largest widths - in the @xmath101 regime - are obtained when a single level dominates the sum , eq .",
    "( [ rmtx ] ) , while the @xmath93 regime correspond to the  multi - level \" situation .",
    "finally , let us discuss what happens when the perturbative approach breaks down .",
    "this takes place when one chaotic level is very close to the localized level , closer than their average coupling @xmath203 there , the strong mixing between states invalidate the expressions for the shift , eq .",
    "( [ rmts ] ) and the width , eq .",
    "( [ rmtx ] ) .",
    "the actual shift and width do not diverge , in contrast to the perturbative expressions .",
    "this means that the actual distribution can not have an algebraic tail towards infinity , but should show a cut - off when perturbation theory breaks down . as explained above , this takes place for one of the @xmath25 of the order of @xmath71 , corresponding to : @xmath204 in agreement with our numerical observations .",
