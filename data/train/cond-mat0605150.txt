    "the first result on the bethe ansatz solutions of the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is to be probably attributed to the short remark by dhar @xcite .",
    "the detailed calculations were later given in a seminal paper of gwa and spohn @xcite , where the issue about the scaling of the next to the largest eigenvalues of the evolution operator was addressed .",
    "the subject has attracted a significant attention since then and a number of the exact results has become available . among the results obtained with the bethe ansatz ,",
    "there are the scaling function describing the crossover of the next to the largest eigenvalue from the kardar - parisi - zhang to the edwards - wilkinson regime @xcite , the large deviation function for the distance travelled by a particle @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these results describe the behaviour of the system in the large time limit . for the finite time evolution ,",
    "we first of all should mention the schtz s determinant solution of the master equation for the asep on the infinite lattice @xcite : the conditional probability of an arbitrary particle configuration , given an initial particle configuration , was obtained .",
    "this solution was later generalized to the ring geometry @xcite , to the asep with particle dependent velocities @xcite and used to evaluate the distribution of the current of particles across the arbitrary bond @xcite at the infinite lattice .",
    "all the above mentioned results concern the continuous time asep , where the jump of a particle is described by the poisson process .",
    "the continuous time solution can be straightforwardly extended to the discrete time dynamics with random sequential update @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution for the asep with backward ordered update @xcite was given in brankov priezzhev shelest .",
    "the history of studies of the asep with fully parallel update rises probably from the 90s , when it was widely discussed as a simplest version of the nagel - schreckenberg traffic model with maximal velocity of cars : @xmath0 @xcite . in that case",
    "the approximate mean - field method proposed to find the stationary measure of the traffic flow models @xcite resulted in the expression , which becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "later it was realized that the mapping to the zero range process ( zrp ) allows one to represent the stationary measure of the parallel asep at the ring in form of the product measure @xcite . in the case of open boundary conditions",
    "the stationary measure was obtained in form of the matrix product @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . at the same time , the description of the time evolution of the asep with parallel update remained challenging unsolved problem for a long time .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the parallel asep is a particular case of the general stochastic process with parallel update , which is solvable by the bethe ansatz povolotsky mendes .    in present article",
    "we use the bethe ansatz to obtain the solution of the master equation for the asep with parallel update on an infinite lattice . given an initial configuration , we obtain the probability of an arbitrary configuration of particles .",
    "the solution is expressed in terms of the determinant of the matrix , which depends on the initial and final configurations of particles and time .",
    "though the general idea of the solution is similar to that of @xcite , the parallel dynamics leads to peculiarities , which make a generalization of previous results nontrivial .",
    "below we give two independent derivations of the final result using two different treatments of the bethe ansatz : the analytic representation based on the expansion of the solution over the bethe ansatz eigenbasis and the geometric one based on the direct enumeration of particle trajectories . while the former reveals the peculiarities of the eigenspace of the evolution operator , the latter clarifies combinatorial aspects of the problem",
    "of course both methods lead to the same final result .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we formulate the model and sketch the results of the article . in the sections iii and",
    "iv we derive the solution using the analytic and geometric bethe ansatz respectively . in the section",
    "v we summarize the results and discuss perspectives .",
    "let us consider @xmath1 particles on 1d infinite lattice . below we imply that the particles move from left to right , which will be also referred to as a forward direction .",
    "at each step of the discrete time each particle may take one step forward with probability @xmath2 or stay with probability @xmath3 provided that the next site is vacant .",
    "if the next site is occupied , the particle stays with probability @xmath4 .",
    "all sites are updated simultaneously at each time step .",
    "we define a configuration @xmath5 of particles by a set of their coordinates @xmath6 . below",
    "we imply them to be ordered : @xmath7the probability @xmath8 for the system to be in a configuration @xmath5 at time @xmath9 obeys the markov equation@xmath10where @xmath11 is the probability of the transition from @xmath12 to @xmath5 for one time step .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath13 are defined by the above dynamical rules .",
    "the goal of the article is to show that the conditional probability , @xmath14 , for the system to be in a configuration @xmath15 at time @xmath9 , given it was in a configuration @xmath16 at time @xmath17 , is the ratio of two determinants @xmath18the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath19 , which depend on two configurations @xmath6 and @xmath20 and on time @xmath9 , are@xmath21where the function @xmath22 is expressed in terms of the gauss hypergeometric functions :    @xmath23    the notation @xmath24 means the shifted factorial @xmath25 .",
    "let us introduce the hilbert space supplied with the complete left and right bases consisting of vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath5 runs over all particle configurations , with inner product @xmath28the state of the system at any time step can be associated with the state vector@xmath29 in terms of the state vectors , the master equation takes a simple operator form @xmath30where the evolution operator @xmath31 is defined as follows@xmath32the conditional probability @xmath33 can be represented as the matrix element @xmath34to evaluate matrix elements , we construct the set of left eigenvectors @xmath35 of the operator @xmath31@xmath36and the adjoint set of right eigenvectors @xmath37 @xmath38which , as will be seen below , are parametrized by the @xmath1-fold parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we will prove that the set forms a complete basis , i.e. provides the expansion of the identity operator @xmath40as a result , the transition probability ( [ t^t ] ) we are looking for can be reduced to the evaluation of the sum @xmath41      the solution of the eigenproblem ( [ t|z>=lambda(z)|z > ] ) corresponding to the master equation of the general integrable asep - zrp model with parallel update was given in @xcite .",
    "here we sketch the solution for the particular case of the parallel asep defined above .    for further purposes it is convenient to introduce a notion of cluster of particles .",
    "a sequence of @xmath42 occupied sites situated one after another with two empty sites on the ends without any other empty sites between them will be referred to as a cluster of the length @xmath42 .",
    "a single isolated particle is the cluster of the unit length . during the evolution",
    "an isolated particle can approach and join a cluster from behind resulting in decrease of the number of clusters at the lattice by one .",
    "the opposite process is when a cluster splits up by a first particle detaching the cluster ahead creating an isolated particle and increasing the number of clusters by one .",
    "if a particle jumps between two clusters , which are separated by only one empty site , the number of clusters does not change .",

    "the discrete space - time dynamics of their motion can be described as a set of continuous broken trajectories on a triangle lattice @xmath188 , which is obtained from the square lattice by adding a diagonal bond between the upper left corner and the lower right corner of each elementary square .",

    "therefore , we can analyse the interaction between particles considering successively elementary squares in each row from left to right starting from an arbitrary empty square until all unwanted trajectories will be removed .",
    "after @xmath310 steps from the top to bottom , one obtains the set of path configurations @xmath311 which are allowed in the first @xmath312 rows , and the set of auxiliary configurations yet not involved into cancellation procedures . remembering that all elements of @xmath313 for all @xmath314 have end points permuted with respect to the original order @xmath315 , we conclude that each element of @xmath313 contains at least one collision point .",
    "therefore , all elements of the auxiliary set will be cancelled after @xmath316 steps with unallowed elements of @xmath305 .",
    "the described way of exclusion of unallowed configurations implies a successive construction of the auxiliary set @xmath317 .",
    "we notice that each two intersecting trajectories in @xmath267 are non - equivalent : one of them belongs to the particle which overtakes another and can be called `` active '' . on the contrary ,",
    "the second particle is `` passive '' . in the case @xmath308",
