    "when physics students are introduced to central forces the subject is mainly , if not exclusively , focused on newtonian forces . while this is completely justified by the physical importance ( and historical influence ) of newtonian forces , it is not always stressed the exceptional nature of this kind of force law among all the possible central forces .",
    "i have often found students that think any orbit of positive mechanical energy is hyperbolic , even if the force is not newtonian .",
    "of course , this belief can be dispelled by telling them that in a harmonic potential @xmath0 every orbit is elliptic and has positive energy .",
    "however , this in turn can reinforce a seemingly natural tendency to think that bounded orbits are always elliptic or , at least , closed , while it is a consequence of a dynamical symmetry @xcite the closely related @xcite newtonian and harmonic force laws .    even in the newtonian case there is room for misunderstandings .",
    "when dealing with the two - body problem one is lead to separate the ( trivial ) motion of the center - of - mass and the relative motion of the two bodies . after studying the keplerian orbits ,",
    "many students are perplexed if asked how would look the orbit of each body in the center - of - mass system or , worse , in another inertial frame in which the total linear momentum is not null ( as we should expect to see in the motion of a binary star system ) .",
    "this is clearly an instance in which a simulation may be helpful .    on the other hand , force laws",
    "for which there is a closed analytical solution for the orbit equation are exceptional ( although of paramount importance ) : apart from the newtonian and harmonic cases , one can mention the potential @xmath1@xcite and the special relativistic version of the kepler problem , @xcite which can be solved by using essentially the same computation needed for newtonian forces .",
    "the cotes spirals @xcite are even more remarkable because not only the orbit equation but also the time evolution may be solved by elementary methods .",
    "there are other cases in which the orbit equation can be solved in terms of special functions , @xcite but they are of little use in introductory courses .",
    "finally there is a handful of cases in which the solution ( or , at least , the orbit equation ) can be computed in terms of elementary functions for special values of the initial conditions ( often when the mechanical energy vanishes or equals the maximum value of the effective potential ) .    for these reasons",
    "a versatile computational tool that can be easily used in the classroom ( and by students at home ) to simulate the motion under central forces can be a valuable pedagogical asset .",
    "the aim of this work is to present such a tool , which we will succinctly do in section  [ sec : program ] , while section  [ sec : activities ] will be devoted to suggest how to effectively use it as a pedagogical tool in a introductory course on mechanics .",
