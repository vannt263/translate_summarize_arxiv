    "the rapidity - gap events recently observed at hera @xcite revived the community s interest in regge - pole description of high energy scattering .",
    "the word ` pomeron ' seldom heard in recent years is once again found in the lexicon of experimentalists .",
    "it is perhaps then a good time to have a new look at the connection between perturbative qcd and regge pole .",
    "non - perturbative effect may be important for momentum transfer of the order of @xmath0 or smaller , but we shall avoid it by going to a larger momentum transfer if necessary .",
    "it was proposed by low and nussinov @xcite some years ago that the pomeron may simply reflect a two - gluon exchange in qcd .",
    "diagrammatic calculations have been carried out @xcite in the leading log approximation to substantiate this proposal and to study other aspects of the high energy near forward scattering amplitudes .",
    "we shall follow the classical approach of implementing physical ( @xmath1-channel ) unitarity by summing up feynman diagrams in the feynman gauge @xcite . however , other approaches are available",
    ". the use of physical gauge and dispersion relation @xcite can sometimes make things more transparent .",
    "one can also emphasize on the complex angular momentum aspect by concentrating on @xmath2-channel towers and their interactions as guided by @xmath2-channel unitarity @xcite .",
    "we shall speak no further of these alternate approaches except to remark that our cut diagram method , to be discussed below , can be thought of an intermediate link between the classical feynman diagram sum and the dispersion relation approaches .    due to the gauge and non - abelian nature of the theory ,",
    "perturbative calculations are lengthy and complicated . even by ignoring self energy and vertex corrections , as well as renormalization effects on the grounds that they will not alter the qualitative nature of high energy scattering we are trying to learn , even by ignoring quark pair productions as a first step ,",
    "a complete qcd calculation can be carried out only up to the 6th order . in the much simpler case of qed , an 8th order calculation @xcite",
    "was reported to have taken sixteen months and two thousand pages to complete . in the case of qcd",
    ", it is much worse , a complete calculation of the 8th order is not available , though partial calculations have been carried out @xcite .",
    "what makes the calculation so complicated is the large number of diagrams that has to be tackled , and the inevitable cancellations between them .",
    "the computation of each diagram is fairly straight forward , though somewhat lengthy at higher orders .",
    "after the individual diagrams are calculated , care must also be exercised to add them up because of the presence of many delicate cancellations .",
    "leading - log dependences on energy get subtracted away , complicated functions of momentum transfer also disappear .",
    "what emerges at the end is a product that is surprisingly simple . to the extent that it has been verified ,",
    "high energy near forward scattering is described by multiple reggeized gluon exchange , supplemented by elementary gluon production off the reggeons and by @xmath1-channel unitarity @xcite .",
    "this outcome has been verified up to the 6th order @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", many delicate cancellations take place in the sum to enable this simple picture to emerge . a complete calculation in the 8th order",
    "is not available , but if one assumes these cancellations which take place up to the 6th order also occur in the 8th and higher orders , then this reggeized picture has been verified up to the 10th order@xcite .",
    "this gives a strong support to the conjecture that it is true to all perturbative orders .    while the conjecture is attractive , it is impossible to verify or refute without a new method to simplify the complicated calculations .",
    "we report in this article such a new method , in which high energy scatterings are computed via _ cut diagrams _ rather than the normal feynman diagrams .",
    "these cut diagrams are _ not _ the cutkosky cut diagrams .",
    "the sum of all cut diagrams here is equal to the sum of all feynman diagrams , and not just their discontinuities .",
    "these cut diagrams can be regarded as a resummation of the feynman diagrams in which many of the delicate cancellations encountered in the latter have been built in and explicitly avoided .",
    "consequently , the simplicity of the final sum is revealed already in individual cut diagrams , and not masked by terms to be cancelled as is the case with feynman diagrams . besides , individual cut diagrams are easier to calculate than individual feynman diagrams .",
    "in this paper we shall introduce the formalism of cut diagrams , as well as an explict calculation to the 6th order to demonstrate its effectiveness .",
    "we shall discuss quark - quark scattering throughout but allow the quarks to carry any @xmath3 color charge .",
    "the result should be equally valid for gluon - gluon and other scatterings because high energy processes are insensitive to the spins of the colliding particles .",
    "we will study pure @xmath3 qcd and ignore the production of quark pairs .",
    "if one is bothered by considering quark - quark scattering while ignoring quark productions , one can consider instead gluon - gluon scattering , and as mentioned above , the result would be the same .    in a subsequent paper@xcite",
    "we shall use the cut diagrams to discuss the reggeization conjecture in higher orders .    in sec .",
    "2 the result of feynman diagram calculations to @xmath4 is reviewed .",
    "how these diagrams combine to give a sum much simpler than the individuals will be discussed in some detail . in sec .  3",
    ", we begin to examine more carefully these cancellations by using sum rules . in sec ,  4 , the method of cut diagrams",
    "is explained , and in sec .  5 ,",
    "this method is applied to 4th and 6th order calculations to demonstrate the savings effected by this method .",

    "different because the cuts here occur only on fermion lines whereas in a cutkosky diagram they can occur on any line .",
    "moreover , via ( 4.2 ) , our cut diagram represents a sum of @xmath113 ( uncut ) feynman diagrams , with their real and imaginary parts fully included , which is unlike the cutkosky diagrams in which only the imaginary part or the discontiuity is represented .",

    "this pole is located in the upper half plane if @xmath204 is negative , and in the lower half plane if it is positive . a way to keep track of the sign",
    "is to draw a _ flow diagram _ for the ` @xmath195 ' momentum , with arrows indicating the direction of the ` @xmath195 ' flow .",
    "see fig .",
    "12 for some illustrative examples .",
    "the arrows around a loop pointing one way ( clockwise or counter clockwise ) have their poles in one half plane , and those pointing the other way have poles in the opposite half plane .",
    "the arrows in the flow diagrams must obey momentum conservation , and one may also assume they do not go around in closed loops . otherwise the poles will all be in the same half plane , and the integral is zero if the contour is closed in the opposite half plane . with these constraints we see in fig .",
    "12 that a one - loop diagram allows only one flow path , but for two and more loops there is bound to be more than one flow diagrams because these constraints simply can not fix the direction of the ` @xmath195 ' flow on a boundary line of two loops .",
    "we shall always close integration contours in the lower half planes , and indicate the poles so enclosed by a cross ( x ) in the flow diagram . for a _",
    "diagram , the @xmath23-matrix element is equal to the product of @xmath206 propagators @xmath207 , integrated over the @xmath208 loop momenta @xmath209 , with an extra numerical factor @xmath210^\\ell$ ] .",
    "each ` @xmath196 ' integration produces a factor @xmath103 , the @xmath23-matrix is equal to @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the scaled ` @xmath195 ' momenta , @xmath213 is the measure for transverse momentum integration , and @xmath214 is either the propagator evaluated at the x poles or the residue of the x pole divided by @xmath5 .",
    "each summand in ( b1 ) corresponds to a flow diagram with a pole taken from the lower half plane ( an x pole ) of each loop .",
    "a flow diagram may have more than one set of x poles , in which case the sum is taken over all possible sets .",
    "for example , the one - loop diagram b1 in fig .",
    "1 has only one flow path ( fig .",
    "12(a ) ) and one set of x poles .",
    "the two - loop diagram c17 of fig",
    ".  1 has two flow paths , figs .",
    "12(b ) and 12(c ) .",
    "the first flow diagram has two sets of x poles , and the latter flow diagram has one set of x poles .",
    "we shall see later that in the leading log approximation , we may discard the @xmath215 dependence on the upper fermion line and the accompanied poles , in which case 12(b ) is also left with one set of x poles .",
    "let @xmath217 .",
    "every @xmath218 is a linear combination of @xmath219 , and in the case of a propagator along the bottom fermion line , @xmath220 is also involved .",
    "the sign of each @xmath218 is fixed by the direction of arrows in the flow diagram .",
    "if there are @xmath221 cut lines , then the last @xmath221 @xmath219 will be chosen to be equal to @xmath222 of these cut lines .",
    "the @xmath206 indices @xmath54 will now be divided into three sets , @xmath223 for indices from 1 to @xmath208 labelling the internal lines with an x pole , @xmath224 for indices labelling propagators on the top fermion line , and @xmath12 for the rest .",
    "then @xmath225 , and @xmath226 can be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath227 , _",
    "@xmath228 within the leading log approximation , one has @xmath229",
    "the ` @xmath195 ' momentum flows mainly along the bottom fermion line , with very little seeping out to avoid a substantial mixing with the ` @xmath196 ' momentum coming from the top fermion line , for a finite mixture of these two at a propagator would make it proportional to @xmath1 and therefore negligible .",
    "this means the dominant contribution to @xmath23 comes from regions where all @xmath219 are small . since @xmath230 for @xmath231 , on account of the @xmath102-functions of the cut lines , the region of ` @xmath195 ' integration can be roughly divided into regions where the remaining @xmath232 @xmath219 s are strongly ordered , and regions where two or more of these @xmath219 s are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we shall label any one of the latter regions by @xmath233 , and the former regions by @xmath234=\\{1\\gg x_1\\gg x_2\\gg\\cdots \\gg x_\\ell'\\ge a / s\\}$ ] and its permutations .",
    "the @xmath235-dependence of @xmath236 in @xmath234 $ ] is of the form @xmath237 , so the @xmath235-integral encountered in ( b1 ) is @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 is determined by how many times the sum @xmath241 reaches zero by varying @xmath242 from 1 to @xmath243 .",
    "clearly @xmath244 , and the only way for @xmath245 is to have all @xmath246 , in which case we will call the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath23 _ saturated_. otherwise it is said to be _",
    "unsaturated_. for the uncut diagrams , @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "we see in ( 2.1 ) that all the diagrams except for the 6th order horizontal ladder diagrams c15 to c20 are saturated . for the cut diagrams in ( 6.1 ) to ( 6.3 ) , only @xmath189 is unsaturated , but this diagram does not contribute to the final sum because of its subdominance .",
    "the integral in an @xmath233 region is like one in an @xmath249 region with @xmath243 reduced .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath250 to @xmath251 are roughly equal but @xmath252 to @xmath253 ( @xmath254 ) are strongly ordered as in @xmath255=r''$ ] .",
    "then the volume element in the last three variables in spherical coordinates is @xmath256 , so the integration region is effectively @xmath257 but with @xmath253 replaced by @xmath258 . since @xmath259",
    ", integrals in @xmath233 will never lead to saturation .",
    "cut diagrams are easier to compute than uncut feynman diagrams for three reasons .",
    "first and most trivial , a cut line contains a @xmath260 which makes the corresponding ` @xmath195 ' integration simpler to carry out .",
    "second and more importantly , the @xmath102-function demands the absence of the ` @xmath195 ' momentum across this line , so the cut line is cut also in the sense of being an open electric circuit .",
    "this generally reduces the number of possible flow diagrams and makes the corresponding integral easier to saturate .",
    "for example , each of the two - loop diagrams in fig .",
    "13 has only one flow path .",
    "thirdly , the flow pattern often leads to vanishing cut diagrams .",
    "for example , both diagrams 13(c ) and 13(d ) are zero from the ` @xmath196 ' integration around the loop ( 12345 ) because the ` @xmath195 ' flows around that loop are all in the same direction .",
    "this accounts for the equality @xmath261 in eq .",
    "( 6.1 ) .",
    "the cost of this simplicity is the presence of _ tricky diagrams _ , which are cut diagrams that are apparently logarithmic divergent at large @xmath202 .",
    "this happens whenever there is a loop with only one arrow present .",
    "arrows on the top fermion line should not be counted for this purpose because their approximate propagators @xmath262 no longer carry any @xmath202 .",
    "13(a ) and 13(b ) are examples of such diagrams .",
    "this apparent divergence is produced by the approximation of replacing the inverse propagators of an upper line by @xmath263 , thus losing some @xmath215 factors needed for convergence . to regulate it",
    "we must replace the @xmath102-function of the cut line by a smeared @xmath102-function , thereby allowing a small amount of ` @xmath195 ' momentum to flow through , and in the process restoring the lost @xmath215 factor .",
    "if we do so to 13(a ) , the @xmath264 integration is no longer divergent , it will have exactly the same flow path as in 12(a ) and this is indicated in 13(a ) by the dotted arrows , so a pole can be taken at the bottom fermion line as shown .",
    "the result is given by ( b1 ) to be @xmath265 , the extra @xmath266 is there because the @xmath235 integration is bounded by the flow path in 12(a ) to be between 0 and 1 , so only half of the @xmath267 is integrated . when multiplied by the qed vertex and normalization factor @xmath268 , one obtains @xmath269 in ( 6.1 ) .",
    "there is another way to compute fig .",
    "this is to recognize the fact that the cut makes it symmetric in lines 1 and 2 , so we may replace the diagram by half the sum of it and its crossed diagram . using the sum rule ( 3.4 ) , @xmath132+a[21]=a[1|2]$ ] ,",
    "a cut can be produced at the bottom line , and the resulting factor @xmath270 makes the @xmath271 integration convergent .",
    "see fig .",
    "moreover , the result of this ` @xmath196 ' integration is @xmath103 , exactly the same as if we were to do it by residue calculus .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath266 obtained in the last paragrpah now emerges because the double - cut diagram on the right of fig .",
    "14 is the sum of two diagrams .",
    "now we come to the tricky diagram 13(b ) , which unlike the one - loop case is much more difficult to compute by regulating the @xmath102-functions .",
    "the reason is that there are now two cut lines , the relative magnitude of the small ` @xmath195 ' flows matters , and that produces once again two flow diagrams like 12(b ) and 12(c ) .",
    "the poles are no longer at the bottom fermion line and the computation is no simpler than the uncut diagrams .",
    "we must then compute it by the second method . with the double cuts in 13(b ) , it is symmetric in all the @xmath272 variables . insisting on this symmetry , 13(b ) is equal to @xmath273 times the sum of 6 diagrams , obtained by permuting the bottom gluon lines in all possible ways . from the factorization formula @xmath134 $ ] used on the bottom line ,",
    "the result is equal to a diagram with all its fermion propagators cut .",
    "so 13(b ) is given by ( b1 ) to be @xmath274 .",
    "incorporating the extra qed factor @xmath275 for the @xmath23 matrix , we obtain the contribution of @xmath276 to @xmath277 shown in ( 6.1 ) .",
    "we conclude this appendix by discussing the remaining expressions in eqs .",
    "( 6.1)(6.3 ) .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath278 to denote the spacetime contribution to @xmath279 , etc",
    ". then @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 can be obtained from ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the zero of @xmath284 in ( 6.1 ) is due to the vanishing of the color factor as shown in fig .",
    "next , we compute @xmath285",
    ". the flow path of this is shown in fig .",
    "13(f ) , with the dotted arrows indicating the small regulating current which is allowed to flow only in the direction shown .",
    "the calculation is identical to the uncut diagram @xcite , except that the factor @xmath286 is replaced by @xmath287 ( @xmath103 from the cut , @xmath40 because only one uncut line is left on top , and @xmath266 because only half of the @xmath102-function is integrated ) .",
    "the result can then be read off from ( 2.1 ) to be @xmath288 which gives rise to the expression in ( 6.3 ) .",
    "finally , we must show that @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "the former can be seen from the flow path in fig .",
    "13(g ) , where the arrows around the small triangle goes around in a closed loop .",
    "the latter is so because the scalar diagram in fig .",
    "7 for @xmath291 is symmetrical in lines 2 and 3 but the triple gluon vertex is antisymmetrical in these two lines .",
