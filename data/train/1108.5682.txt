    "helium & hydrogen emissions and double metallic absorption lines were first observed in wvirginis stars by sanford in the 1940s .",
    "schwarzschild ( 1952 ) invoked the propagation of shock waves across the atmosphere to explain the double absorption lines during rising light .",
    "the first quantitative model of shock waves explaining the hydrogen emissions was developed by whitey ( 1956 ) as reported by wallerstein ( 1959 ) who rediscovered the emission lines of the hei .",
    "hei emission lines were used to confirm the shock model since they indicate that the high temperature behind the shock was sufficient to ionize helium once , and then hydrogen .    in rrlyrae stars , the first detection of h ",
    "emissions and the double h  absorption lines were reported by sanford ( 1949 ) .",
    "iroshnikov ( 1962 ) interpreted the observations of metallic and hydrogen line radial velocities , splitting of the spectral lines and hydrogen emission lines of rrlyr made by sanford ( 1949 ) with the help of a model in which the shock wave propagates through an exothermic gas in the atmosphere of rrlyr .",
    "he concluded that the discontinuity in the radial velocity curve , the emission and double absorption hydrogen lines , at the maximum of the light curve , would be the consequence of shock waves propagating through the atmosphere of rrlyr .",
    "the best spectroscopic observations had been made half a century ago by george preston and his collaborators ( preston 1961 & 1962 ; preston and paczynski 1964 ; and preston et al .",
    "1965 ) . using a spectrogram ( 10.7 mm@xmath2 ) attached to the 3 m telescope of lick observatory",
    ", they rediscovered the h  emissions which occurs only during an interval of 4% of the period , followed by the double h  absorption lines during rising light , especially in rrlyr and xari .",
    "they explained the phenomena as a consequence of the propagation of a strong shock wave through the atmosphere of rrlyrae stars .",
    "thanks to the improvements of cdd detectors compared to photographic plates , chadid and gillet ( 1996a ) detected for the first time the doubling phenomenon over the ionized metallic absorption lines of rrlyr by using the elodie spectrograph attached to the 2-m telescope at observatoire de haute provence , france .",
    "they interpreted the phenomenon as the consequence of a `` two  step '' schwarzschild mechanism .",
    "the shock is at first receding from the observer , becomes stationary and then advances .",
    "later , they confirmed the metallic line doubling phenomenon in the one of largest amplitude rrab stars , sarae , and they detected for the first time a new mechanism , the neutral absorption line disappearance phenomenon during rising light , occurring during an interval of 8% of pulsation ( chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) using uves at vlt - ut2 .",
    "they interpreted the phenomenon as a consequence of an hypersonic shock existence in the photosphere of rrlyrae stars .",
    "`` _ ... but no one applied wallerstein s ideas about wvirginis to rrlyrae stars during the next half century ( observers & theorists alike ) . until ,",
    "quite by accident ... i detect emission or / and absorption lines of helium in rrlyrae spectra ... _ '' george preston said in a private communication .",
    "thus , preston ( 2009 ) detected for the first time the hei spectrum during rising light of rrlyrae stars on a time scale of @xmath3 2h .",
    "this discovery adds new constraints on the rapidly evolving temperature structure of the atmosphere towards a better understanding of hypersonic shock waves in atmosphere of rrlyrae stars ( chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "more than a century after its discovery ( blazhko 1907 ) , the blazhko effect still remains a big challenge .",
    "it greatly complicates our accurate measurements of the atmospheric dynamics of rrlyrae stars and introduces unavoidable complications in an understanding of stellar pulsation and evolution .",
    "george preston had great adventures with the blazhko effect , when he tried to understand the motions of his favorite star tygruis ( preston et al 2006a and 2006b ) . ``",
    "_ ... blazhko just makes it worse .",
    "i dislike blazhko ... so many blazhko vectors aimed at me make me nervous ... _ ''",
    "george said .",
    "one of the models , trying to explain the blazhko effect , predicts the dependence of the blazhko amplitude upon the strength of a magnetic field of the order of 1.5 kg ( the oblique  dipole rotator model ) .",
    "however , from the observational point of view , the question whether rrlyrae blazhko stars are magnetic is still a matter of debate . until recently , rrlyr itself was the only object that has been the target of spectro - polarimetric observations and with contradictory results .",
    "babcock ( 1958 ) and romanov et al . ( 1987 , 1994 ) reported a variable magnetic field with amplitude around 1.5 kg .",
    "preston ( 1967 ) and chadid et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported no detection .",
    "having covered several pulsation periods and blazhko cycles spread over a period of 4years with high precision ( @xmath4@xmath380 g ) longitudinal magnetic field measurements .",
    "chadid et al concluded that rrlyr is a bona fide nonmagnetic star .",
    "as said by george preston `` _ ... unlike the redwood trees , when you ve seen one rrab , you have not seen them all ... _ '' ; thus , in order to evaluate the preston and chadid et al .",
    "non  detection of the magnetic field to others rrab blazhko stars , i have obtained a new series of high precision circular polarization spectroscopic observations of the blazhko star rvuma that i report in this work with the helium line detections in the hypersonic atmosphere of sarae .    in this paper , the hump and the bump",
    "will be used according the adopted nomenclature used by christy ( 1966 ) .",
    "the hump occurs on the rising branch just before the luminosity maximum while the bump appears during decreasing light just before the luminosity minimum .",
    "high resolution spectra , presented in this work , are based on the blazhko rrab star , sarae , one of the largest amplitude rr lyrae stars , with pulsation period of 0.452days , blazhko cycle is 48 days and v  magnitude is between 10 and 11.5 .",
    "i used the high resolution uv  visual echelle spectrograph uves at the vlt ",
    "ut2 ( kueyen ) on cerro paranal covering the 376500 and 6721000 ranges ( eso programs programs p67.d-0321(b ) and p67.d-0321(a ) ) . a detailed description of observations and data reduction are given in chadid et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in order to achieve an extended coverage in the wavelength range",
    ", i also used the high - accuracy radial velocity planetary searcher spectrograph harps at eso 3.6-m telescope on la silla observatory covering the wavelength range from 380 to 690 nm ( eso program p79.d0462 ) with more observation details in chadid et al.(2010 ) .",
    "spectra of rrlyrae stars show hydrogen ( double ) emission lines , helium emission lines , neutral metallic line disappearance phenomenon , line broadening and doubling phenomena , which cause a discontinuity in the radial velocity curve .",
    "all these observational features are interpreted by the presence of shock waves propagating in their atmosphere .",
    "schwarzschild ( 1953 ) was the first who pointed towards the shock stratification as the origin of the double absorption lines .",
    "the schwarzschild s mechanism is the temporal sequence followed by the blue shifted and red shifted components of a double absorption line ( figure[schw ] ) .",
    "an upward propagating shock wave cuts the layer of formation of an absorption line in two parts with opposite motions .",
    "the red shifted component appears first alone and followed by the doubling phenomenon . when the shock is far away from the layer , only the blue shifted component is visible .",
    "figure[structure ] shows an illustration of a shock wave propagating structure , as described by zeldovich and raiser ( 1960 ) in a cool stellar medium .",
    "the shock structure can be subdivided into several principal zones with different physical characteristics . for large mach numbers strong shocks",
    "the higher collision rate caused by the high increase of the temperature causes a thermal dissociation and even ionization of chemical elements ( in the thermalization zone , zone3 ) . in this case , the radiative recombination ( in the chemical relaxation zone named the cooling wake , zone4 ) produces a photon energy propagating much faster than the shock wave ( photo - dissociation or photo - ionization zone called precursor , zone2 ) . the shock front ( zone1 ) , the zone where the average parameter discontinuities of the chemical particles steeply change ( density , velocity and temperature ) , is much thinner than the precursor and gives direct information on the shock velocity and strength . on the other hand , the shock wake is the most important zone , because it is directly connected to the formation of the observed emission lines and their interpretation .",
    "it is partially transparent both in the balmer and higher continua and in weak spectral lines .",
    "the whole shock structure is very sensitive to the degree of ionization in the precursor , especially if it was initially weak . at high mach numbers ( @xmath510 ) ,",
    "the shock is fully dominated by radiative phenomena .",
    "the coupling between hydrodynamic and radiative fields is high and can completely dominate the shock structure through the transfer equation , which is non - local ( more details in chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the atmosphere of rrlyrae stars can be characterized by the passage of two shock waves .",
    "the _ main shock _ , at the hump , has higher intensity and rises into the atmosphere .",
    "it is due to the @xmath6 mechanism . the _ early shock _ , at the bump , is the consequence of the ballistic motion of the atmosphere . according to the observations ( table1 ) ,",
    "the intensity of the main shock is very high and can generate a total ionization of some neutral elements ( hypersonic shock , chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) , in addition to emission , double emission line structure and absorption line doubling phenomena ( preston et al .",

    "the evolution of the neutral helium profile is consistent with preston ( 2009 ) results , and confirm , in a general way , the shock model proposed by schwarzschild : first only a pure emission appears at strongest hydrogen emission phase ( 0.96 ) .",
    "this emission sometimes is followed by the appearance of a first he component red shifted and then by a second he component blue shifted which strengthens with advancing phase and reflecting the line doubling phenomenon like metallic and balmer line doubling phenomena ( chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) . both helium components ( red and blue shifted )",
    "gradually weaken and disappear .",
    "the lifetime of the he absorption line mechanism is nearly equal to that of the neutral metallic line disappearance phenomenon ( chadid et al .",
    "2008 ) . both of them occur around the maximum luminosity and during a phase interval of 8% of the pulsation period .    like hydrogen emission",
    ", helium emission lines should be formed just behind the shock front , in a zone of cooling wake , due to the de  excitation of the neutral helium atom .",
    "the helium emissions require greater excitation energy than hydrogen lines .",
    "thus , their detection indicates that the shock velocity is strongly supersonic and the conditions within the shock wake are extreme .",
    "this is consistent with the hypersonic shock detection in sarae .",
    "i recall that the minimum energy required for a high  excitation of a neutral helium atom is 19.74ev , equivalent to the excitation threshold temperature of 229,082k .",
    "the temporal evolution of the helium doubling phenomenon is shown to be in general agreement with the classical schwarzschild mechanism .",
    "a new shock wave crosses the deepest atmospheric layers when the ballistic motion induced by the previous shock is far from being relaxed .",
    "the shock at the beginning expands with the atmosphere , crossing the helium line forming region with a velocity higher than the layers and a temperature equal to the temperature of excitation of helium atom .",
    "the shock reaches the layers of the helium region at phase 0.96 and produces the double components ( blue and red shifted ) , the red shifted component disappearing more and more .",
    "finally , the shock leaves the helium region completely at phase 1.05 when a total disappearance of helium absorption is observed .",
    "figure[heii ] shows a weak emission of the single ionized helium line heii 4685.68 , a similar detection has been reported by preston ( 2011 ) in asvir , uvoct and v1645sgr .",
    "this means that , the shock temperature is high enough to ionize even the neutral helium atom , and reaches a temperature value of 285,367k ( the temperature required for an ionization of a neutral helium atom and equivalent to a minimum energy of 24.59ev ) .",
    "this means that the shock wave in rrlyrae stars sarae , asvir , uvoct and v1645sgr is extremely strong a hypersonic shock and can reach a mach number greater than 30 .",
    "using the fiber  fed echelle spectro - polarimeter narval ( auriere 2003 ) at the 2-m telescope bernard lyot ( tbl ) of pic du midi observatory , i carried out , on february 27 and 28th , 2009 , high precision ( median @xmath11  g ) longitudinal magnetic field measurements of the blazhko rrlyrae star rvuma , which is an rrab star with a large amplitude , ( v  magnitude is between 10.11 and 11.23 ) , a pulsation period of 0.468 days and a blazhko cycle of 90 days ( preston & spinrad 1967 ) . the stokes v spectra were obtained at various pulsation phases and have been reduced using the libre - esprit data reduction package ( donati et al 1997 ) .",

    "none of rvuma lsd stokse @xmath12 profiles ( figure[stokes ] ) put into evidence of any circular polarization in the mean stokes profiles of rvuma over one pulsation cycle .",
    "the rvuma observations follow the line of results obtained by preston ( 1967 ) and chadid et al ( 2004 ) for rrlyr itself and reveal a serious challenge to the magnetic models for explaining the blazhko effect .",
    "our results on the magnetic field of rrlyrae stars with different pulsational properties imply that the oblique  dipole rotator model ( balazs - detre 1964 ) is not able to determine the relevant mechanism at the origin of the blazhko effect .",
    "stothers ( 2006 , 2010 ) suggested that the turbulent / rotational dynamo mechanism generates , in some rrlyrae stars , the magnetic fields that grow over the blazhko cycle and suppress turbulent convection , and in turn small changes in the period of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "the physical mechanism suggested by stothers appears very promising , but in order to fully check this hypothesis more detailed predictions about the key observables such as amplitude , phase and period modulations are required .",
    "recently , chadid et al .",
    "( 2011 ) detected in the 0.567 days variable corot i d 0105288363 , significant cycle  to  cycle changes in the blazhko modulation , which appear to be analogous to those predicted by stothers .",
    "they discussed the clear correlations between the phase and the amplitude of the bump , and the skewness and acuteness of the light curve during different blazhko cycles .",
    "they found that these quantities are strongly anti - correlated with the fundamental pulsation period .",
    "this provides a strong support to the slow convective cycle model suggested by stothers .",
    "however , how does slow convective cycle happen in blazhko hypersonic atmospheres ?    struve ( 1947 ) discovered the occurrence of transitory hydrogen emission in rrlyr itself and struve and blaauw ( 1948 ) showed that its intensity varies in the 41-day cycle ( blazhko cycle ) .",
    "preston , smak and paczynski ( 1965 ) found that the visibility of doubling of the hydrogen absorption components is correlated with the strength of the hydrogen emission in the 41day cycle and also that the doubling of the higher members of the balmer series always precedes that of the lower ones . from the data of these two last studies",
    ", it appears that the observed average radial velocity over one pulsation period is also a function of the 41day cycle .",
    "preston , smak and paczynski ( 1965 ) interpreted these phenomena as a consequence of a variation of the critical level of the shock - wave formation region during the 41day cycle .",
    "the doubling phenomenon of the metallic absorption lines is the predominant contribution of the considerable and very narrow fwhm increase observed in rr lyr ( chadid and gillet 1996b ) .",
    "this latter could provide a point of contact between observation and stothers hypothesis ( as mentioned already by preston 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , the spectroscopic work of chadid & gillet ( 1997 ) reveals that the amplitude of shock waves is greatly correlated with the blazhko modulation .",
    "thus , the stothers s proposal , slow convective cycles in the envelopes of rrlyrae stars ( stothers 2001 ) , seems to be not enough to explain the blazhko modulation of rrlyrae hypersonic atmospheres .",

    "<S> this is consistent with my recent spectro - polarimetric measurements ( 2004 ) , over four years , concluding that rrlyr is a bona fide nonmagnetic star , leading to the falsification of all the models of the blazhko effect requiring strong photospheric magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> here , i will report on a new series of high precision circular polarization spectroscopic observations of the blazhko star rvuma . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal field measurements of rvuma show a mean longitudinal magnetic field value of @xmath0  g. none of measurements of rvuma shows a significant detection over a whole pulsation period . </S>",
    "<S> finally , all these spectroscopic results reveal a serious challenge for explaining the complex behavior in the pulsation of hypersonic atmosphere of rrlyrae stars .    </S>",
