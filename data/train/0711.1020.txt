    "cobaltates with general formula acoo@xmath4 ( a @xmath5 rare - earth ions ) forms an interesting class of compounds in the perovskite family.@xcite the primary concerns in these systems is the understanding of the temperature induced spin state transition .",
    "extensive effort has been put forward both theoretically and experimentally to understand this effect .",
    "the ground state of these compounds are believed to be nonmagnetic ( spin @xmath6 = 0 ) insulator having co@xmath7 ion in low spin ( ls ) configuration with fully filled co @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "increase in temperature leads to non - magnetic insulator to paramagnetic metal transitions.@xcite it was suggested that such transitions occurs due to thermally driven spin state transition of co@xmath7 ions.@xcite the major controversy in these studies involves the identification of the spin state in the intermediate temperatures range .",
    "some studies@xcite suggest that the spin state of co is an intermediate spin ( is @xmath9 @xmath10 , s = 1 ) state , while the others suggest a mixed low spin and high spin ( hs @xmath9 @xmath11 , s = 2 ) state.@xcite despite numerous investigations on this issue , the controversy in the spin state transition is still unresolved .",
    "most of the studies mentioned above have focussed on the spin state transitions in lacoo@xmath4 , where the crystal field splitting is close to the exchange interaction strength .",
    "if we replace la by pr , the smaller ionic radius of pr compared to la provides a chemical pressure on the system .",
    "it is observed that the crystal structure of prcoo@xmath0 is different from that of lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "the powder diffraction work has shown that the crystal structure of lacoo@xmath4 and prcoo@xmath4 are rhombohedral and orthorhombic , respectively.@xcite the average co - o bond length of prcoo@xmath4 is less than that of lacoo@xmath4 and hence the crystal field splitting is expected to be enhanced in prcoo@xmath0 . the co - o - co bond angle is smaller in prcoo@xmath0 compared to that in lacoo@xmath0 . in addition , 4@xmath1 electrons corresponding to pr atoms and the hybridization of the 4@xmath1 states with the valence electronic states will play an important role in determining the magnetic properties in this system .",
    "the transport and optical conductivity measurements exhibit a larger band gap and higher insulator to metal transition temperature in prcoo@xmath0 compared to that in lacoo@xmath0.@xcite it was suggested that the decrease in valence band width due to the change in co - o - co bond angle leads to such effect .",
    "the temperature dependent infrared spectroscopy data of prcoo@xmath4 have shown the ls to is state transition around 220 k.@xcite the susceptibility data of prcoo@xmath4 obtained after subtracting the contributions from pr@xmath7 ions have shown increased population of the is state around 200 k.@xcite thus , prcoo@xmath0 is an ideal system to throw some light in understanding the interplay between crystal field splitting and exchange coupling strength in the spin state transition in cobaltates .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the temperature evolution of spin state of co ion in prcoo@xmath0 using state - of - the - art photoemission spectroscopy and _ ab initio _ band structure calculations . the experimental valence band spectra exhibit signature of gradual increase in band gap with the decrease in temperature .",
    "the comparison of the experimental and calculated results for the valence band indicates that the co ion presumably possesses an is state configuration in the temperature range , 150 - 300 k. this is also manifested in the shallow core level spectra .",
    "spin orbit coupling ( soc ) plays an important role in determining the electronic structure in this system .",
    "prcoo@xmath4 was prepared in the polycrystalline form by combustion method .",
    "@xcite nitrates of pr and co were taken in appropriate amount and mixed in double distilled water . in this mixture ,",
    "2 moles of glycine per 1 mole of metal cation was added and stirred until all compounds dissolved in the water .",
    "the resulting solution was heated slowly at temperature around 200 @xmath12c till all the water evaporated .",
    "the precursor thus formed catches fire on its own making the powder of the compound .",
    "the hard pallets of this powder were formed and heated at 1200 @xmath12c for one day .",
    "the sample was characterized by @xmath13-ray powder diffraction and resistivity measurements .",
    "the powder diffraction data did not show any impurity peak ; all the peaks were well fitted with orthorhombic phase ( space group pbnm ) using rietveld refinement technique .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained from the fitting match well with those reported in the literature .",
    "resistivity data are also consistent with the available data in the literature.@xcite    the photoemission spectra were recorded using a spectrometer equipped with monochromatic sources such as @xmath13-ray source , al @xmath14 ( 1486.6 ev ) , ultraviolet sources , he ii ( 40.8 ev ) and he i ( 21.2 ev ) .",
    "the electron detection was carried out by a gammadata scienta analyzer , ses2002 . the energy resolution for the @xmath13-ray photoemission ( xp )",
    "was set to 0.3 ev for the valence band and 0.6 ev for the core level spectra .",
    "the energy resolution for the he ii and he i spectra were fixed to 4.2 mev and 1.4 mev , respectively .",
    "the base pressure during the measurements was about 4@xmath1510@xmath16 torr .",
    "we have used a he - cryostat , lt-3 m from advanced research systems for the measurements at different temperatures .",
    "the sample was cleaned _ in situ _ by scraping the sample surface using a diamond file .",
    "the cleanliness of the sample was ascertained by tracking the sharpness of o 1@xmath17 peak and absence of c 1@xmath17 peak .",
    "the o 1@xmath17 spectra recorded at 150 k and 300 k are shown in fig .",
    "the contribution of impurity peak around 531 ev binding energy is negligible ( @xmath18  3% ) indicating the good quality of the sample .",
    "the fermi level was aligned by recording the valence band spectrum of an ag foil mounted on the same sample holder .    the gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) and gga+@xmath19 ( @xmath19 = the electron correlation strength ) calculations were carried out using lmtart 6.61.@xcite for calculating charge density , full - potential linearized muffin - tin orbital method working in plane wave representation was employed . in the calculation , we have used the muffin - tin radii of 3.43 , 2.019 , and 1.688 a.u . for pr , co and o , respectively .",

    "the hubbard @xmath19 and exchange @xmath21 are considered as parameters .",
    "we have taken @xmath19 = 3.5 ev for co 3@xmath3 and pr 4@xmath1 electrons and @xmath21 = 1.0 ev for co 3d electrons .",

    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath21 for 3@xmath3 electrons are consistent with our previous studies.@xcite these calculations were performed by taking ls , is and hs configurations , which correspond to ( @xmath22 ) , ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) electronic configurations , respectively , as initial input .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath25 ryd / cell .",
    "final orbital occupancies for pr 4@xmath1 , co @xmath8 and @xmath26 states were obtained from self - consistent gga+@xmath19 calculations for different initial state configurations .",
    "( 8 , 8 , 6 ) divisions of the brillouin zone along three directions for the tetrahedron integration were used to calculate the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "co @xmath8 , co @xmath27 and o 2@xmath2 partial density of states ( pdos ) obtained from gga calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "2(a ) and pdos of pr 4@xmath1 in fig .",
    "it is evident from the figures that there are finite pdos of co @xmath27 , o 2@xmath2 and pr 4@xmath1 at the fermi level indicating the metallic ground state which is contrary to the experimentally observed insulating ground state .",
    "the pdos below the fermi level can be divided into three regions : ( i ) region a up to -1.6 ev from the fermi level , ( ii ) region b from -1.6 ev to -3.4 ev and ( iii ) region c below -3.4 ev .",
    "region a has dominating co 3@xmath3 character along with small o 2@xmath2 contributions having similar energy distribution of the pdos .",
    "this feature is attributed to the antibonding states .",

    "region b is essentially contributed by non - bonding o 2@xmath2 states .",
    "the bonding states having @xmath8 and @xmath26 symmetry contribute in region c with dominant contribution from o 2@xmath2 electronic states .",
    "the contribution of pr 4@xmath1 pdos appears in the narrow region from -0.1 ev to 0.4 ev indicating the highly localized nature of pr 4@xmath1 electrons .    in order to investigate the role of soc in the electronic structure in the limit of generalized gradient approximations",
    ", we have calculated the density of states including soc .",
    "the calculated pdos of co @xmath8 , co @xmath27 and o 2@xmath2 states are shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) and that of pr 4@xmath1 states in fig . 2(d ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that inclusion of soc has negligible influence on the co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 pdos .",
    "however , soc drastically modifies the pr 4@xmath1 pdos as evident from fig .",
    "it splits into two well separated regions .",
    "region below 0.25 ev is identified to be pr 4@xmath28 states and region above 0.25 ev appears due to pr 4@xmath29 contributions .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting of pr 4@xmath1 states is found to be about 0.4 ev .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "2 that the dos at the fermi level , @xmath30 is finite in both the cases ( with soc and without soc ) ; an indication of a metallic ground state .",
    "thus , the consideration of electron correlation is necessary to capture the insulating ground state observed experimentally .    the inclusion of on - site coulomb correlation on co 3@xmath3 electrons ( @xmath31 = 3.5 ev ) under gga+@xmath32 formulation modifies the positions and distributions of co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 pdos as evident in fig .",
    "the most significant effect of @xmath31 is observed in the antibonding co @xmath8 states ( the feature a in the figure ) , which shifts to lower energy by about 0.8 ev . the contribution of the o 2p states enhances significantly in this energy range .",
    "as expected @xmath31 does not affect pr 4@xmath1 bands .",
    "interestingly , co @xmath27 states have finite contribution at the fermi level , which is not expected as the inclusion of @xmath31 of 3.5 ev was sufficient to create a hard gap of about 0.22 ev in lacoo@xmath4.@xcite this indicates that pr 4@xmath1 states strongly hybridize with the o 2@xmath2 and co @xmath27 orbitals in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "this is also manifested by the shape of the energy distribution of the dos in this energy region .",
    "still , there is finite dos at @xmath30 characterizing the system to be metallic .    in order to capture the correct ground state of prcoo@xmath0",
    ", we have included the on - site coulomb correlation among pr 4@xmath1 electrons ( @xmath33 ) . since",
    ", the @xmath1 electrons are more localized than the @xmath3 electrons , the electron correlation strength among @xmath1 electrons is expected to be larger than that for @xmath3 electrons . in our calculations , we have considered @xmath33 to be similar to @xmath31 (= 3.5 ev ) so that it corresponds to the lower limit in @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we show the co @xmath8 , co @xmath27 and o 2@xmath2 pdos .",
    "pr 4@xmath1 pdos obtained are shown in fig .",
    "pr 4@xmath1 pdos exhibit a large splitting leading to the formation of lower and upper hubbard bands representing the localized density of states .",
    "the energy gap between these bands is as large as 2.2 ev . interestingly",
    ", such splitting introduces significant modification in the co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 dos .",
    "the 4@xmath1 symmetry adapted co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 states also appear in the same energy range as that of the 4@xmath1 bands and a band gap of 0.27 ev appears between the @xmath8 and @xmath26 states characterizing the system to be an insulator .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of @xmath33 introduces a large shift of the features a , b and c towards the fermi level along with a significant change in the energy separation among themselves .",
    "while the feature a is predominantly contributed by co 3@xmath3 pdos in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the contribution from o 2@xmath2 pdos to the feature a enhances significantly making almost equal to that from co 3@xmath3 state .",
    "it is thus evident that pr 4@xmath1 states play an important role in determining the electronic states in the vicinity of @xmath30 and hence the electronic properties of this system .",
    "we now study the effect of different spin configurations of co@xmath7 ion on the valence band calculated using gga+@xmath19 method .",
    "the pr 4@xmath1 , co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 pdos corresponding to co@xmath7 ion in ls , is and hs configurations are plotted in figs .",
    "4(a ) , 4(b ) and 4(c ) , respectively .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the insulating gap of about 0.27 ev observed for ls configuration is not present in the other cases .",
    "in addition , there are several changes in the valence band corresponding to the is and hs state compared to that for the ls state .",
    "the low energy spread of the valence band increases from ls to is by about 1 ev and it further increases by about 0.3 ev in the hs state .",
    "the co 3@xmath3 character of the energy bands at lower energies gradually enhances with the increase in spin state .",
    "the co 3@xmath3 character of the energy bands close to @xmath30 observed in ls state reduces significantly in the is state . in the hs state , the energy band with dominant co 3@xmath3 character appear below -5 ev .    in fig . 5",
    ", we show the background subtracted experimental valence band spectra of prcoo@xmath4 recorded at room temperature using monochromatic al k@xmath34 , he ii and he i. all the spectra show zero intensity at the fermi level indicating the insulating behavior of the compound .",
    "all the spectra exhibit three distinct peaks at about 1.1 , 3.2 and 4.9 ev marked by a , b and c , respectively .",
    "the al k@xmath34 spectrum is dominated by the intensity of peak a. this trend is reversed in the he ii and he i data . due to the matrix element effect , the photoemission cross section corresponding to various electronic states changes significantly with the change in photon energy .",
    "the relative cross section for o 2@xmath2 states with respect to that of the co 3@xmath3 and pr 4@xmath1 states is significantly higher in ultraviolet photon energies .",
    "the @xmath13-ray energies correspond to the reverse case .",
    "thus , large intensity of the features b and c in the he i and he ii spectra compared to the intensity of the feature a indicates that the features b and c has dominant o 2@xmath2 character and the feature a is essentially contributed by the co 3@xmath3 and pr 4@xmath1 states . in order to investigate the energy positions of the pr",
    "4@xmath1 and co 3@xmath3 contributions , we compare the al @xmath14 spectrum of prcoo@xmath0 with that of lacoo@xmath0 . clearly , the intensity around 1 ev has dominant co 3@xmath3 character .",
    "the large intensity difference observed around 1.7 ev as marked by d in the figure correspond to the intensities from pr 4@xmath1 states .",
    "this is consistent with the previous studies.@xcite    a comparison of the results in figs .",
    "4 and 5 indicates that the experimental results in fig .",
    "5 correspond closely to the results in fig .",
    "4(b ) indicating large is state contributions at room temperature . in order to bring out the comparison more clearly",
    ", we show the spin - integrated dos corresponding to is state in fig .",
    "evidently , the character of various features and their energy positions observed in the calculated dos are very close to the experimental results .",
    "the experimental o 2@xmath2 non - bonding band appears at slightly higher binding energy compared to that observed in the calculated results .",
    "such small shift in energy position of the o 2@xmath2 non - bonding states is often observed due to the neglect of electron correlation effect among o 2@xmath2 electrons.@xcite it is to note here that the observation of co 3@xmath3 band at about 6 ev binding energy in the hs state has no resemblance with the experimental spectra .",
    "this indicates that the contribution from hs state at room temperature is essentially absent .",
    "it is important to note here that although features in the dos corresponding to is state provide a remarkable representation of the experimental spectra , the insulating gap observed in the experimental spectra as well as in the bulk measurements could not be captured in our calculations for these parameters .",
    "one needs to enhance the values to @xmath19 unrealistically high to achieve such insulating phase . in that case , the features in the dos will be significantly different .",
    "it is well known that orbital ordering plays an important role in determining the electronic structure of these systems . to get an insulating state",
    ", one should consider the orbital ordering in the calculations.@xcite however , such considerations does not have significant influence in the energy position of the features .",
    "we now turn to the temperature evolution of the electronic structure . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the valence band spectra collected at different temperatures .",
    "the xp spectra shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) exhibit almost identical lineshape of the spectra at 300 k and 150 k. the band edge appears to shift slightly towards higher binding energies .",
    "the he ii spectra shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , however , exhibit significant change with temperatures .",
    "the decrease in temperature leads to gradual increase in intensity of the feature around 5 ev characterized as the bonding features .",
    "subsequently , the intensity of the features around 1 ev decreases . since",
    ", the photoemission cross section corresponding to o 2@xmath2 states is significantly enhanced in the he ii photon energies , the change in fig 6(b ) suggests gradual enhancement of the o 2@xmath2 character of the bonding feature with the decrease in temperature .",
    "we have expanded the near @xmath30 region of the he ii spectra in fig .",
    "6(c ) to clearly investigate the spectral changes .",
    "it is clear that the intensity at about 1 ev reduces to a lower value at 250 k compared to the intensity at 300 k. however , further reduction in temperature does not have significant influence in the intensity of the feature .    from the _",
    "ab initio _ results ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , we have observed that the increase in spin state leads to an enhancement of the co 3@xmath3 character at higher binding energies and the o 2@xmath2 contributions shift towards @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the increase in o 2@xmath2 character at higher binding energies with the decrease in temperature indicates that the contribution from ls state enhances gradually with the decrease in temperature .",
    "these results thus provide a direct experimental evidence of dominant is contribution at 300 k and an evolution towards ls state with the decrease in temperature .",
    "we could not measure the spectra at lower temperatures due to the charging effect .    in order to investigate the shift of the valence band edge leading to an enhancement of the band gap with the decrease in temperatures , we have extracted the co 3@xmath3 and pr 4@xmath1 part by subtracting the o 2@xmath2 contributions appearing at higher binding energies .",
    "the subtraction procedure is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where the lines in the figure represent the o 2@xmath2 spectra obtained by using a combination of lorentzians convoluted by a gaussian .",
    "the extracted features are shown in figs .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) for xp and he ii spectra , respectively .",
    "although this feature is contributed by pr 4@xmath1 and co 3@xmath3 states , the large change in photon energy ( from 40.8 ev to 1486.6 ev ) thereby different change in the photoemission cross section does not have significant influence in the lineshape of the feature .",
    "this suggests a strong overlap between the 4@xmath1 and 3@xmath3 contributions in this energy range .    we have expanded the band edge part of the high - resolution he ii spectra in fig .",
    "interestingly , the band edge gradually shifts towards higher binding energies with the decrease in temperature .",
    "the shift is most significant between 300 k and 275 k. in the temperature range of 275 k to 200 k , the change is almost negligible and further decrease in temperature again leads to a shift of the band edge towards higher binding energies .",
    "such change can be correlated to the transport data too . in fig .",
    "7(d ) we show the activation gap calculated from the resistivity data .",
    "interestingly , the temperature induced change of the band gap corresponds well to the shift of the band edge in fig .",
    "7(c ) .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show the calculated majority and minority o 2@xmath17 and pr 5@xmath2 pdos corresponding to ls , is and hs states .",
    "these pdos can be divided into four regions as marked in the figure . in the ls state , the region 1 spreading over -15.1 to -16.3 ev has dominating pr 5@xmath2 character and can be attributed to the spin - orbit split pr 5@xmath35 states .",
    "the region 4 ( between -18.8 and -19.3 ev ) has predominantly pr 5@xmath2 character corresponding to spin - orbit split pr 5@xmath36 state . in region 2 ( from -16.4 to -17.1 ev ) , the contribution from o 2@xmath17 states is most evident and region 3 ( from -17.4 to -18.0 ev ) has highly mixed o 2@xmath17 and pr 5@xmath2 characters .",
    "it is evident from the figures that the overall shape and spread of o 2@xmath17 and pr 5@xmath2 bands remain almost the same for all the spin state configurations .",
    "however , the energy position of these bands are very much sensitive to the spin state of the co ion .",
    "the whole pattern is shifted to lower energy side by about about 1.0 and 1.1 ev in the is and hs states , respectively .",
    "the calculated o 2@xmath17 and pr 5@xmath2 pdos for the is state are compared with the experimental spectra in fig .",
    "9 . there are two distinct features in the experimental spectra centered around 16.8 and 20.6 ev .",
    "the intensity ratio of the two features are different from 1:2 expected for pr 5@xmath2 signals due to the overlap of the o 2@xmath17 signal appearing in this energy range . in order to identify the character of the features , we overlap the mg @xmath14 spectrum over the al @xmath14 spectrum .",
    "this change in photon energy leads to a larger enhancement of the photoemission cross section of the o 2@xmath17 states compared to that for pr 5@xmath2 states .",
    "@xcite a normalization by the pr 5@xmath35 peak intensity exhibits an enhancement in the energy region of 17 - 20 ev .",
    "this clearly indicates that the presence of o 2@xmath17 feature in this energy region .",
    "the calculated dos corresponding to the is state is shown in fig .",
    "evidently , the calculated dos provide a remarkable representation of the experimental spectra in terms of energy position and relative intensities .",
    "it is clear that the energy positions obtained for is and hs configurations are very similar to to the experimental results and the energies for ls configuration is very different .",
    "finally , we discuss the electronic occupancies of different orbitals and corresponding magnetic moments obtained from self - consistent calculations by considering initial spin state of co ion in ls , is and hs configurations .",
    "the electronic occupancies of pr 4@xmath1 , co @xmath8 and co @xmath27 for majority and minority spin channels corresponding to ls , is and hs states are given in table i. the occupancies of pr 4@xmath37 and pr 4@xmath38 are closer to 2.2 and 0.2 , respectively , and insensitive to the spin state of co ion .",
    "however , the occupancies of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are very much sensitive to initial spin state configurations as expected .",
    "the total occupancy of co 3@xmath3 orbitals is significantly higher ( @xmath43  6.69 ) than 6 expected for co@xmath7 and gradually decreases with the increase in spin state as also observed in the case of lacoo@xmath4 compounds in earlier studies.@xcite interestingly , @xmath42 orbitals are also partially occupied ; 0.56 , 0.44 and 0.42 electrons in the results corresponding to ls , is and hs states , respectively .",
    "this is not _ a priori _ expected for co@xmath7 electronic configuration .",
    "moreover , one can also see a remarkable increase in the total occupancies of pr 4@xmath1 ( by @xmath430.4 ) .",
    "this increment in the occupancies is a clear indication of the strong hybridization between pr 4@xmath1 with the valence electrons having o 2@xmath2 and co 3@xmath3 characters facilitating large charge transfer .",
    "this is also manifested in fig .",
    "3 ; the shape of the co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 pdos in the energy range of pr 4@xmath1 bands are very similar to pr 4@xmath1 pdos .    spin and orbital part of the magnetic moment of pr 4@xmath1 , co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 for different spin state is given in table ii .",
    "spin part of the magnetic moment for pr 4@xmath1 state is almost insensitive to the spin state of co ion and it is closer to 2 @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that pr@xmath7 ion is in spin triplet state .",
    "spin part of the magnetic moments for co 3@xmath3 state when co ion is in ls , is and hs states are 0.03 , 1.79 and 2.96 @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , the orbital part of the magnetic moment for pr 4@xmath1 comes out to be negative and strongly depends on the spin state of the co ion .",
    "it s magnitude increases with the increase in spin state .",
    "the negative sign indicates that the orbital and spin moments are antiparallely coupled .",
    "the orbital moment of the co 3@xmath3 electrons is almost zero for ls and is state and for hs state it is 0.21 @xmath44 .",
    "interestingly , one can also see the contribution of spin part of magnetic moment from o 2@xmath2 electrons when co ion is in hs state .    using the values of magnetic moments given in table ii , one can calculate the effective magnetic moment of prcoo@xmath4 . this quantity can be directly compared with susceptibility data .",
    "the calculated values obtained for ls , is and hs states are about 2.0 , 3.1 and 4.3 @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the value of the effective magnetic moments thus obtained for the is state is closer to the experimental value of about 3.6 @xmath44 obtained by fitting magnetic susceptibility data between 100 - 150 k by using curie - weiss law.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have investigated the detailed electronic structure of prcoo@xmath0 and its temperature evolutions using various forms of _ ab initio _ calculations and high resolution photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "we observe that gga+@xmath19 calculations provide a good description of the ground state properties .",
    "partial density of states obtained for various configurations and parameters exhibit signature of strong hybridization of pr 4@xmath1 states with co 3@xmath3 and o 2@xmath2 valence electrons .",
    "in addition to the electron correlations , spin - orbit coupling plays an important role in determining the electronic structure of this compound .",
    "the calculated pr 4@xmath1 , pr 5@xmath2 , co 3@xmath3 , o 2@xmath17 and o 2@xmath2 partial density of states corresponding to intermediate spin ( is ) state of co ion provide a good representation of the experimental spectra at 300 k. the contribution from high spin state configurations appears to be negligible .",
    "pr 5@xmath2 and o 2@xmath17 core level spectra could be captured reasonably well within this formalism .",
    "the decrease in temperature from 300 k leads to an enhancement of the ls contributions in the electronic structure .",
    "the band gap gradually enhances with the decrease in temperature as observed in the transport data .",
    "the calculated effective magnetic moment for is state is also consistent with the magnetic susceptibility data .",
    "the calculated spin moment of pr 4@xmath1 electrons indicates that the pr@xmath7 ion is in spin triplet state and the spin - orbit coupling is antiparallel .",
    "the orbital part of the magnetic moment of pr ion is highly sensitive to the spin state of the co ion .",
    "its magnitude increases gradually with the increase in spin state .",
