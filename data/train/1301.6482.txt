    "quantum correlation is one of the most popular research topics since it plays a central role in quantum information and communication . usually people thought that the quantum computation devices should get their computational power from entanglement  one of the most essential nonclassical features in quantum mechanics .",
    "recently , it was found that there exist other nonclassical relations apart from quantum entanglement .",
    "the concept of the quantum discord ( qd ) which is defined as the difference between the quantum mutual information and the classical correlation was introduced by ollivier and zurek  @xcite to quantify the non - classical correlations .",
    "it has been observed that the qd provided a larger region of quantum states with non - classical correlations , for example , even some separable states have non - zero qd  @xcite .",
    "in fact , only zero discord is a necessary condition for strictly classical correlations  @xcite , so that the states with non - zero qd are responsible for the efficiency of a quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "therefore , qd could be a new resource for quantum computation , and even far cheaper and easier to maintain in the lab .",
    "quite recently , many people devoted into the study of quantum discord@xcite .",
    "although there are several advantages , a big problem for the application of discord is that it is complicated to calculate qd analytically .",
    "even for the two - qubit systems , the analytic results of qd can only be obtained for a few cases such as @xmath2-type states @xcite , and a general method still lacks . since that , daki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite study the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of non - zero qd for bipartite states and introduce a geometric measure of quantum discord ( gmqd ) , which can be evaluated for an arbitrary two - qubit state .",
    "the concept of the gmqd simplifies the calculation of the qd .    in quantum many - body correlated system ,",
    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is an essential phenomenon and attracts widespread attention . as a quantum critical phenomenon",
    ", qpt happens at absolute zero temperature , at which the thermal fluctuations vanish so that no classical phase transition could occur .",
    "thus qpt is driven only by quantum fluctuation and caused by changing the system s hamiltonian , such as an external magnetic field or the coupling constant . at the quantum phase transition point ,",
    "the qpt behaves as the configuration transition of the ground state ( gs ) .",
    "therefore , one can easily expect that some quantum concepts closely related to the ground states can be used to indicate qpts .",
    "for example , the concepts of quantum entanglement@xcite , quantum fidelity@xcite and quantum squeezing@xcite , have already been widely and successfully employed to study qpts .    as a concept of quantum correlation",
    ", it is natural to consider the relation between the qd and the qpts .",
    "recently , people become to make use of qd to investigate qpts . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it shows that qd spotlights the qpt point for @xmath3 heisenberg chain even at finite temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum criticalities in the environment also play an important role in the dynamics of the qd@xcite . in some typical systems with qpts",
    ", it is found that both classical correlation and quantum discord exhibit signatures of the qpts@xcite .",
    "all these works imply that qd is an effective tool in detecting qpts .    in this paper , in terms of the concept of qd",
    ", we will consider the qpts of the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with next - nearest - neighbor interaction which is also called the @xmath4-@xmath5 model .",
    "this is an interesting quantum many - body system for the existence of competition between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) couplings .",
    "it well describes the material structure in some quasi - one - dimensional compounds , such as cugeo@xmath6@xcite .",
    "there are two important qpts in this model@xcite , a first - order qpt and an infinite - order qpt .",
    "the first - order qpt lies on the energy - level crossing of the ground state ( gs ) , while the infinite - order qpt is found to be closely related to the energy - level crossing of the low - lying excited states ( ess ) and can be detected by the first - es fidelity@xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the qd in this system is lack of study , which motivates us to consider and show that the qd of the gs and the ess is effective to indicate the qpts in this system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we introduce the conception of the qd and the gmqd . in sec.iii , we give a general analytical result of the gmqd for the @xmath2-type states . in sec.iv , we analytically calculate the eigenenergies of the @xmath4-@xmath5 model for the 4-site and 6-site cases , then obtain the two - site gmqd and qd analytically . in sec.v , we will numerically show that the gmqd is a good candidate to indicate the qpts . in sec.vi , we consider the frustration by making use of the entanglement excitation energy ( exe ) and a universal measure @xmath7 .",
    "then we find the relation between frustration and the gmqd .",
    "finally , the conclusion will be given .",

    "it turns out that the geometric bipartite ground - state entanglement measured by @xmath233is a universal lower bound to the frustration @xmath232 , and @xmath72 is the rank of the projector @xmath234 . for the degenerate gs @xmath235",
    ", @xmath72 indicates the degeneracy .",
    "@xmath236 are the eigenvalues of @xmath237tr@xmath238 in decreasing order .    in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model , the gs of @xmath239 ( or @xmath240 )",
    "is the singlet state @xmath241 , thus the projector @xmath242 with @xmath243 .",
    "then we obtain the frustration measure is a function of the correlator as :    @xmath244    where @xmath245 and @xmath246 or @xmath247 .   from the frustration measure in eq.@xmath248([f_ij ] ) , we exploit a nonlinear relation with the gmqd that@xmath249@xmath250from which , the gmqd achieves the maximum value @xmath251 when the frustration vanishes @xmath252 , and has zero value when a finite frustration exists @xmath253 .",
    "this implies that the frustration in this model will depress the pairwise correlation , however , it enhances the block correlation between the two - site subsystem and the rest subsystem , which can be verified by calculating the linear entropy @xmath254obviously , when @xmath255 , the linear entropy has the maximum value which signals the the maximal bipartite entanglement between the two - site subsystem and the rest part of the system . to note that we now consider the pure gs case ,",
    "thus the linear entropy is an effective measure of the bipartite  entanglement and also the quantum correlation because we also find a direct relation between the linear entropy and the gmqd that @xmath256from which one can clearly find that the maximal pairwise correlation @xmath257 will destroy the block correlation between the two - site subsystem and the rest part , then @xmath258 .",
    "the total measure of frustration is defined as @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the number of bonds , and in our model @xmath261 ( @xmath98 is the total number of the spin ) , then we obtain @xmath262 , \\end{aligned}\\]]in the above , we make use of @xmath263 , and @xmath264 corresponding to the nn sites and nnn sites respectively .",
    "now we calculate the lower bound @xmath265with the help of the energy levels shown in fig.1 , for  the gs energy level , obviously , one can find @xmath266 when @xmath267 , and @xmath268 when @xmath183 .",
    "thus based on the eq.([ed_sr ] ) , we have @xmath269it is known that the inequality @xmath270 implies the appearance of the geometric frustration@xcite .",
    "hence , we find that the geometric frustration appears when @xmath267 and vanishes when when @xmath183 .",
    "it implies that the frustration measure and its lower bound can reflect the change of the fundamental structure of the system , such as the energy level crossing , therefore , they can be used to indicate the first - order qpt point @xmath101 .",
    "based on the analytical results of the gs energy level in the 4-site and 6-site case , we calculate the frustration measure . for 4-site case ( let @xmath109 ) : the frustration of the nn sites @xmath271and the frustration of the nnn sites    @xmath272    for 6-site case , we have the frustration of the nn sites @xmath273where @xmath274 , and the frustration of the nnn sites @xmath275 for larger size system such as @xmath223 , we numerically calculate the frustration measure and its lower bound in fig.5 . both the nn - site frustration measure @xmath276 in subfigure ( a ) and the nnn - site frustration measure @xmath224 in subfigure ( b ) present a sudden change at the qpt point @xmath178 .",
    "moreover , in the subfigure ( a ) , we shows that the nn - site frustration measure @xmath276 and its lower bound @xmath277 are consistent with each other , which implies that only quantum frustrations exist between nn sites .",
    "differently , in the subfigure ( b ) , we find the nnn - site frustration @xmath278 when @xmath267 , which signals the appearance of the geometric frustration .    from the above",
    ", we find the nonlinear dependence of the gmqd on the frustration , which implies that the pairwise quantum correlation characterized by the gmqd is greatly affected by the frustration , e.g. , some finite frustration as @xmath255 can depress the  gmqd to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "we believe that the frustration measure can be used to characterize the first - order qpt in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model and also other systems . in addition",
    ", the inequality @xmath279 holds as well in any mixed states@xcite , thus the method is also effective to detect the first - order qpts in the degenerate gss . in our @xmath280-@xmath5 model , the quantity @xmath281 can also be used in the first - excited states to detect the qpt point @xmath282 .",
    "however , in the excited states ( ess ) case , the quantity @xmath232 can not be understood as the frustration measure , instead , it only quantifies how much fails to fully overlap with the subspace selected by the projector @xmath234 , and the projector @xmath234 may come from the gs or the es of the local interaction @xmath227 .",
    "in this paper , we considered the quantum discord ( qd ) in the heisenberg spin chain with next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction . by using the geometric measure of the quantum discord ( gmqd )",
    ", we studied the quantum correlation properties of the ground states ( gss ) and the first excited states ( ess ) .",
    "we give a general analytical result of the gmqd for the @xmath2-type states .",
    "for the heisenberg system with the @xmath0 symmetry and @xmath1 symmetry , we give an exact relation between the gmqd and the two - site correlators .",
    "furthermore , the connection between gmqd and the eigenenergies was revealed .",
    "for the 4-site and 6-site cases , the analytical results of the gmqd for the gs and first es are obtained , from which the first critical point @xmath283 can be exactly detected .",
    "we also numerically studied the nn - site and nnn - site gmqd of the ess .",
    "it is found that when the system size increases from 6 sites to 10 sites , the discontinuous point of the gmqd tends to the second qpt point @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , by using the entanglement excitation energy and a universal frustration measure we considered the frustration properties of the system and find the nonlinear dependence of the gmqd on the frustration .",
    "the measure of the frustration can also be employed to detect the qpts in this system .",
    "we emphasize that the two - site gmqd can detect the qpts in this heisenberg system with nnn interaction .",
    "although the two - site gmqd approach is only effective in the finite - size systems , it has practical significance for the usual theoretical and experimental studies .",
