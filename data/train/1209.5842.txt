    "therefore , @xmath0 emission may be a powerful tool to study galaxy evolution .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath0 flux is proportional to star formation rate ( sfr ) when the ionizing photons are absorbed by neutral hydrogen .",
    "however , most @xmath0 photons can experience numerous scattering processes by neutral hydrogen due to its large cross section . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 photons can have a large optical depth and can be efficiently absorbed by interstellar dust .",
    "hence , although most star forming galaxies are intrinsically laes , some may not show a strong @xmath0 line due to efficient dust absorption .",
    "it is therefore crucial to study the escape of @xmath0 photons to understand laes .",
    "observationally , some groups have derived the escape fraction of @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) from the observed flux ratio between @xmath0 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 @xcite , and at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath5 decreases with color excess @xmath17 , albeit with a large dispersion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath5 can be derived from @xmath0 and uv continuum flux @xcite , and it was suggested that @xmath5 monotonically increases with redshift and can be fitted with simple power - law function @xcite .",
    "theoretically , semi - analytical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cosmological hydrodynamics simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that an adjustment of @xmath0 flux by a factor of @xmath18 is needed to fit the observed luminosity function or @xmath0 equivalent width distribution .",
    "more recently , by combining cosmological hydrodynamics and three - dimensional @xmath0 radiative transfer ( rt ) simulations , it was suggested that the escape fraction of @xmath0 photons decreases with halo mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ionizing photons escaping from laes may contribute significantly to cosmic reionization .",
    "it is widely believed that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is highly ionized at @xmath19 from the gunn - peterson troughs @xcite in observed quasar ( qso ) spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that it should be partially ionized even at @xmath20 from the thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "the possible ionizing sources are thought to be star - forming galaxies , qsos , and population iii stars .",
    "however , since the observed number density of qsos drops drastically at @xmath21 , the ionizing photons from qsos alone can not maintain the ionization of the igm at high redshift @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since the number density of laes does not decrease significantly at @xmath22 @xcite , and the contribution from laes to the cosmic star formation rate density becomes dominant at high redshift @xcite , so high - z laes may play an important role in the ionization of igm .",
    "however , the estimation of ionizing ability of laes in previous work suffered from ambiguities in the escape fraction of @xmath0 and ionizing photons .",
    "moreover , an equivalent width ( ew ) of larger than @xmath23 is frequently used as the definition of laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , it is important to understand the difference of escape fraction between @xmath0 and the non - ionizing uv continuum .",
    "as the photon escape depends sensitively on the galaxy properties , the ionization state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the dust content , it is necessary to investigate the radiative transfer of these different photons in galaxies simultaneously .    in this work",
    ", we study the escaping of @xmath0 , non - ionizing uv - continuum ( @xmath1 in the rest frame , hereafter simply `` uv continuum '' ) , and ionizing photons ( @xmath2 ) from galaxies by combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with three - dimensional multi - wavelength radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the galaxy model in  2 , and our multi - wavelength radiative transfer code @xmath24 in  3 . in  4 , we present the results of the escape of @xmath0 , uv - continuum , and ionizing photons , including their evolution with redshift , dependence on galaxy properties , and the contribution of laes to cosmic reionization .",
    "we discuss the dependence of @xmath18 on the clumpiness of the ism , and the limitations of our calculations in  5 , and summarize our findings in  6 .",
    "the cosmological simulation presented here follows the formation and evolution of a milky way - like galaxy and its substructures .",
    "the simulation has been employed in a series of radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations by @xcite and @xcite , and it will be described in detail in zhu et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . here we briefly highlight some important features of the simulation .",
    "it uses the aquila initial condition , which is the hydrodynamical version @xcite of the initial condition of the aquarius project , the largest ever particle simulation of a milky way - sized dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "the simulation includes dark matter , gas dynamics , star formation , black hole growth , and feedback processes .",
    "it was performed using the parallel , n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 , which is an improved version of that described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gadget implements the entropy - conserving formulation of sph @xcite with adaptive particle smoothing , as in @xcite .",
    "radiative cooling and heating processes are calculated assuming collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "star formation is modeled in a multi - phase ism , with a rate that follows the schmidt - kennicutt law ( @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from supernovae is captured through a multi - phase model of the ism by an effective equation of state for star - forming gas @xcite .",
    "the uv background model of @xcite is used .",
    "the whole simulation falls in a periodic box of @xmath25 on each side with a zoom - in region of a size @xmath26 .",
    "the spatial resolution in the zoom - in region is @xmath27 pc in comoving scale .",
    "the mass resolution of this zoom - in region is @xmath28 for dark matter particles , @xmath29 for gas , and @xmath30 for star particles .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , consistent with the five - year results of the wmap @xcite .",
    "the simulation evolves from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .    in the simulation , a galaxy",
    "is identified as a group using on - the - fly friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finding algorithms , which links baryon particles to their nearest dark matter neighbor with a dark matter linking length less than 20% of their mean spacing .",
    "we note that while our simulation produces a number of properties similar to those of the mw , such as the morphology , total mass , and star formation rate , some properties do not agree well with observations .",
    "for example , the stellar to halo mass ratio is somewhat higher than that from abundance - matching analysis of @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite conducted a comprehensive comparison of the mw simulations using different numerical techniques and physical models .",
    "he found that the simulated galaxy properties depend sensitively on the feedback model , and that no simulation to date has produced a  perfect \" mw .",
    "however , we should stress that the main purpose of this work is to study the escape of uv continuum , @xmath0 and ionizing photon from galaxies over a wide range of redshifts , not producing an exact mw .",
    "the rt calculations are performed using the 3d monte carlo rt code , all - wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree ( @xmath24 ) , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 features three essential modules : continuum emission from x - ray to radio , @xmath0 emission from both recombination and collisional excitation , and ionization of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the coupling of these three modules , together with an adaptive refinement grid , enables a self - consistent and accurate calculation of the @xmath0 properties , which depend strongly on the uv continuum , ionization structure , and dust content of the object .",
    "moreover , it efficiently produces multi - wavelength properties , such as the spectral energy distribution and images , for direct comparison with multi - band observations .",
    "the detailed implementations of the @xmath24 code are described in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 calculations and briefly outline the process .",
    "the @xmath0 emission is generated by two major mechanisms : recombination of ionizing photons and collisional excitation of hydrogen gas . in the recombination process , we consider ionization of neutral hydrogen by ionizing radiation from stars , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , and uv background ( uvb ) , as well as by collisions with high - temperature gas .",
    "the ionized hydrogen atoms then recombine and create @xmath0 photons via the state transition @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath0 emissivity from the recombination is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the case b recombination coefficient , and @xmath40 is the average number of @xmath0 photons produced per case b recombination .",
    "here we use @xmath39 derived in @xcite .",
    "since the temperature dependence of @xmath40 is not strong , @xmath41 is assumed everywhere @xcite .",
    "the product @xmath42 is the energy of a @xmath0 photon , 10.2  ev .    in the process of collisional excitation",
    ", high temperature electrons can excite the quantum state of hydrogen gas by the collision .",
    "due to the large einstein a coefficient , the hydrogen gas can occur de - excitation with the @xmath0 emission .",
    "the @xmath0 emissivity by the collisional excitation is estimated by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the collisional excitation coefficient , @xmath45 @xcite .    once the ionization structure has been determined , we estimate the intrinsic @xmath0 emissivity in each cell by the sum of above @xmath0 emissivity , @xmath46 .    in the rt calculations ,",
    "dust extinction from the ism is included .",
    "the dust content is estimated according to the gas content and metallicity in each cell , which are taken from the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio of the mw is used where the metallicity is of solar abundance , and it is linearly interpolated for other metallicity .",
    "we adopt the dust size distribution of @xcite for solar metallicity and a @xmath47 sn model , as in figure @xmath48 in their paper .",
    "the size distribution is then combined with the dust absorption and scattering cross section of @xcite to calculate dust absorption opacity curves .",
    "we use the stellar population synthesis model of galaxev @xcite to produce intrinsic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of stars for a grid of metallicity and age , and we use a simple , broken power law for the agn @xcite . a @xcite initial mass function over the range of @xmath49 is used in our calculations .    in this work",
    ", we apply @xmath24 to the selected galaxies from the cosmological simulation .",
    "we pick @xmath50 massive galaxies from each snapshot , which gives a total of 936 galaxies .",
    "the smallest galaxy in the sample has a mass of @xmath51 at @xmath52 , and it consists of total @xmath53 particles . in our post - processing procedure , we first calculate the rt of ionizing photons ( @xmath54 ) and estimate the ionization fraction of the ism .",
    "the resulting ionization structure is then used to run the @xmath0 rt to derive the emissivity , followed by the calculation of non - ionizing continuum photons ( @xmath55 ) in each cell .",
    "our fiducial run is done with @xmath56 photon packets for each ionizing , @xmath0 , and non - ionizing component , which was demonstrated to show good convergence @xcite .",
    "the highest refinement of the adaptive grid corresponds to a cell size comparable to the spatial resolution of 250 pc in comoving coordinate of the hydrodynamic simulation .",

    "the time evolution of the escape fraction of @xmath0 , uv continuum at @xmath57 in rest frame , and ionizing photons is shown in figure  [ fig : fesc_z ] . in this work ,",
    "we define escape fraction as the ratio of total escaped photons along various angles to total emitted photons , i.e. , angular mean values .",
    "we find that @xmath18 of @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) moderately evolves with redshift , and the median values range from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath5 somewhat decreases with increasing redshift at @xmath62 , and then increases with redshift @xmath63 . at lower redshift , since the amount of the gas and dust decreases due to star formation , so some fraction of the @xmath0 photons can escape .    the median @xmath5 remains nearly constant , @xmath64 at @xmath65 , which is similar to the observed value and trend with redshift in laes from the hetdex pilot survey @xcite .",
    "the large dispersion in @xmath5 , which is similar to the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may be caused by different galaxy properties such as mass , metallicity and star formation , as we will discuss later in the paper . at @xmath63 ,",
    "our result is in broad agreement with the implication of @xcite , although the escape fractions of our sample increase more slowly with redshift .    at @xmath62 ,",
    "however , our results differ from the empirical model of @xcite , in which @xmath5 is parameterized as a power - law function of redshift , @xmath66 , with the best fitting power - law index @xmath67 .",
    "this simple relation implicitly comes from the redshift evolution of metallicity in galaxies suggested by some theoretical predictions ( e.g , * ? ? ? * ) and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dust content can increase with metal in gas , and can effectively absorb @xmath0 photons . on the other hand , the distribution of gas and dust can strongly affect @xmath5 ( e.g. , yajima et al .",
    "in addition , at low redshift , a large fraction of dust is consumed by star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fgas_z ] shows the redshift evolution of gas mass , star formation efficiency , and dust mass .",
    "the dust mass decreases with redshift at @xmath62 .",
    "hence @xmath5 of our model galaxies does not decrease with redshift at @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , there is a large dispersion in the observed estimation of @xmath5 and the intrinsic @xmath0 emission , and there is currently no constraint on @xmath5 at @xmath68 .",
    "our results are consistent with the observations within the uncertainties . at @xmath22 ,",
    "the gas mass increases as redshift decreases because of galaxy growth via gas accretion and merging processes . at @xmath62 ,",
    "star formation consumes a large fraction of gas and causes a decrease of the gas mass with redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the star formation efficiency , @xmath69 , monotonically increases with decreasing redshift . at @xmath70 ,",
    "the stellar mass starts to be larger than the gas mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of dust mass is not as straightforward . until @xmath70 , the dust mass increases with redshift due to enrichment by type - ii supernovae , however ,",
    "thereafter it moderately decreases because the dusty gas is consumed by star formation .",
    "thus , at lower redshift @xmath62 , although metallicity is high , @xmath5 does not decrease due to the smaller dust mass .",
    "the gas fraction and star formation efficiency ( @xmath69 ) can change depending on the feedback models in the simulations .",
    "strong feedback suppress the consumption of gas by star formation , resulting in lower @xmath71 .",
    "in such a situation , at lower redshift , galaxies may keep having significant gas and dust , and show asmaller escape fraction .",
    "our current feedback model can reproduce cosmic star formation rate history over wide range of redshift well while it tends to make too many stars at lower redshift ( zhu et al . in prep . ) .",
    "however , the correct prescription of feedback is still under the debate , there is no perfect model to reproduce all observational properties of galaxies .",
    "an improved prescription of feedback and star formation will be addressed by a large number of cosmological simulations and comparison with observation in future work ( zhu et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the evolution of the escape fraction of uv continuum at @xmath72 , @xmath6 , is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : fesc_z ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the general trend is similar to that of @xmath5 , as @xmath6 is also determined by the dust content and its distribution .",
    "however , since the path length of @xmath0 photons before escaping can be longer than that of the uv continuum photons , so the absolute value of @xmath5 is expected to be smaller than that of @xmath6 . for comparison with observations",
    ", this figure also shows @xmath6 derived by using observed @xmath73 with calzetti s extinction law @xcite .",
    "the attenuation by dust at @xmath74 is estimated by @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "our result agrees well with the observations , which shows a moderate increase with redshift from @xmath70 to @xmath76 .    on the other hand , the escape fraction of the ionizing photons , @xmath7 , shows a different evolution , as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : fesc_z ] . unlike @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 does not change significantly with redshift , possibly due to absorption of the ionizing photons by both neutral hydrogen and dust . in general , the mean gas density in galaxies increases with redshift , @xmath77 , and the recombination rate is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "hence at high redshift , it becomes difficult for stellar radiation to ionize the gas .",
    "note , however , that this argument is based on a spherical top - hat model , i.e. , the mean density of halo is @xmath79 times higher than inter - galactic medium ( igm ) at when it is virialized @xcite . in practice , there are many high - density regions due to clumpy structure even at lower redshfit .",
    "in addition , the mass ratio of gas to stars also increases with redshift , therefore , ionizing photons can be more effectively absorbed by interstellar hydrogen gas at higher redshift , leading to a low value of @xmath7 . on the other hand , at lower redshift @xmath62 , due to the decrease of sfr ( see figure 2 in * ? ? ? * ) , the neutral fraction of hydrogen increases as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : xh1 ] . as a result ,",
    "hi gas mass does not decrease despite the lower total gas mass .",
    "this leads to the suppression of @xmath7 at @xmath80 .",
    "although the hi gas mass decreases at @xmath81 due to ionization , the increased dust mass contributes to the absorption of ionizing photons .",
    "consequently , @xmath7 shows the weak redshift dependence .",
    "@xmath7 is not well constrained observationally , due to a number of uncertainties which include the intrinsic sed , the dust attenuation of the uv continuum , and the igm attenuation .",
    "in addition , most observed objects are so faint that only upper limits were obtained on @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 from our simulations is close to the mean observed value at @xmath70 @xcite and the upper limit at @xmath59 @xcite , but somewhat higher than the upper limit at @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that our model galaxies are fainter than the sample of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : density ] shows the density profiles of gas , stars and dust of the most massive galaxies in the snapshots as a function of physical distance from the galactic center . with increasing redshift , gas density becomes high and the distribution is more concentrated towards the galactic center , resulting in the suppression of escape of ionizing photons . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - density gas induces many scattering of @xmath0 photons , although most of them can successfully escape from galaxies due to the small dust content . at @xmath36 , a large fraction of gas near the center",
    "is converted to stars . near the central region ,",
    "the gas density decreases with increasing redshift , while the stars increase .",
    "some bumps in the density profiles are due to the clumpy structure and the merging process .",
    "overall , our results of the escape fraction of the @xmath0 and continuum photons are in general agreement with current observations . however , we note that the simulated galaxy sample in this work is very small , and it is limited to progenitors of a mw - like galaxy",

    "we assess the strength of the correlation by fitting a simple power - law function , for instance , @xmath85 , for galaxies at each redshift .",
    "the fitting is done on the mean value of each data point , with a bin size of 0.25 dex for the @xmath5 .    as shown in the figure",
    ", the scatter in the @xmath86 relation ( upper panel ) appears to be smaller than that of the @xmath7 - @xmath5 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the slope of the former relation falls in the range of @xmath87 and does not evolve with redshift , while that of the latter decreases with redshift from @xmath88 at @xmath89 to @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath5 is more closely correlated with @xmath6 than with @xmath7 .",
    "the cause of the different relations is the difference in the escape processes .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , both @xmath6 and @xmath5 depend strongly on the dust content as it is the main absorber of @xmath0 and uv photons , but ionizing photons can also be absorbed by neutral hydrogen gas , so @xmath7 depends on not only on the dust , but the gas as well .",
    "in particular , the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath7 becomes large at higher redshift . at high redshift",
    ", most of the @xmath0 photons can escape due to the small dust content , while ionizing photons can be absorbed by nearby clumps of hi gas .",
    "if star clusters are embedded in the high - density clumps , most of the ionizing photons are absorbed and @xmath7 can be very small @xmath92 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in the large difference .",
    "to further demonstrate the escape processes of the @xmath0 and uv continuum and their relation to each other , it is useful to examine the `` @xmath93 '' value , the relative strength of optical depth between @xmath0 and uv continuum , @xmath94 . naively , one may think that since the traveling paths of @xmath0 photons are much longer than uv continuum photons due to numerous scattering processes , @xmath95 would be larger than @xmath96 , resulting in high @xmath93 values ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "however , recent observations suggest that @xmath98 at @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : q_z ] shows the resulting `` @xmath93 '' value from our calculations at different redshifts .",
    "it has a mild variation over a wide redshift range @xmath100 , with a median value @xmath98 .",
    "this is in good agreement with observations , suggesting that photon escape is a complicated process affected by many factors other than scattering . at high redshift ,",
    "the dust content is low , and it distributes compactly around galaxy center .",
    "hence , although @xmath0 photons can experience many scattering processes over an extended region , they can escape without dust absorption , leading to @xmath101 . at low redshift , since the amount of dust and metallicity increase , @xmath0 photons are more effectively absorbed by dust than the uv continuum , resulting in a somewhat higher @xmath93 .",
    "the relationships between photon escaping processes and galaxy properties and their evolution are not well known . here",
    "we explore the dependence of photon escape fraction ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) on various physical properties of the galaxies from our simulations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fesc_mass ] , @xmath5 and @xmath6 appear to have similar relationships with galaxy properties such as total mass , metallicity , dust mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , specific sfr ( ssfr ) , and star formation efficiency .",
    "there is no strong correlation between photon escaping and the physical properties of the galaxy , although @xmath5 and @xmath6 show a weak declining trend with the galaxy mass , metallicity and dust mass in the interstellar medium , albeit with large dispersions .",
    "such a trend is in broad agreement with observations that metal enriched galaxies tend to have lower @xmath5 @xcite .    in galaxies with high sfrs",
    ", there is a large supply of dust and neutral hydrogen gas for star formation , which can lead to efficient scattering and absorption of @xmath0 photons .",
    "this trend is in good agreement with the recent semi - analytic work of @xcite , which shows suppression of @xmath0 escape by dust in galaxies with high sfrs .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 photons can frequently encounter dust in high - metallicity regions .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 in galaxies with high sfrs , metallicity , and dust mass can be effectively absorbed by dust , resulting in a low @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 appears to roughly decrease with halo mass .",
    "for example , at @xmath102 , @xmath103 at @xmath104 to @xmath105 at @xmath106 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous simulations by @xcite , in which they calculated @xmath5 of nine galaxies at @xmath107 and found a similar relationship .",
    "however , @xmath7 , does not show any clear dependence on any of these properties .",
    "this again may be the result of more complicated radiative processes of the ionizing photons in dust and neutral hydrogen gas , and it may explain the lack of evolution with redshift seen in the previous section .",
    "we note that some previous studies reported some correlation between @xmath7 and halo mass @xcite",
    ". the discrepancy may be due to the different galaxy population used in these studies . in our simulation",
