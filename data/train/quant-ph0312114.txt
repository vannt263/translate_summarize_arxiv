    "heisenberg - limited quantum interferometry ( hli ) is of interest for ultra - precise measurement of phase and energy differences @xcite .",
    "possible applications include the enhancement of atomic frequency standards and of gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "although optical interferometry often comes to mind first , interferometry at the heisenberg limit concerns any bosonic quantum wave , and even fermionic ones @xcite .",
    "the absolute minimum error on the phase difference @xmath4 between the two interferometer arms , for @xmath0 detected bosons , is the heisenberg limit ( hl ) , @xmath5 to be compared to the shot - noise limit of the beam splitter ( snl ) , @xmath6 these limits arise from the quantum interference of the two input modes , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , on the first beam splitter ( boson - mode splitter ) of the interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ f : bs ] ) .",
    "c    this interference defines the quantum noise @xmath9 of the photon number difference at the output of the beam splitter ( i.e.  inside the interferometer ) .",
    "the quantum noise @xmath10 of the phase difference is then given by the number - phase heisenberg inequality @xmath11 in conventional interferometry , one of the inputs , say @xmath8 , is a vacuum mode and the result of the interference is a binomial probability law , which yields the snl , whatever the state of the bright input , @xmath7 , is @xcite .    in order to achieve hli , it is necessary to modify the vacuum input @xmath8 .",
    "this can be done by squeezing a vacuum - field quadrature , as first proposed by caves @xcite and experimentally realized by xiao _",
    "_ @xcite and grangier _ et al .",
    "numerous other schemes have been proposed since @xcite , in particular by yurke , mccall , and klauder @xcite and holland and burnett @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the latter proposal , whose experimental implementation is in progress in our group @xcite .",
    "it is based , for reaching the hl , on the use of indistinguishable twin fock states @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unit wave vector ,",
    "@xmath14 the frequency , @xmath15 the unit polarization vector , and @xmath16 the photon ( boson ) number .",
    "it is remarkable that , in the same manner as for the snl @xcite , common - mode quantum statistics do not matter and the hl can be reached as efficiently by using superpositions or mixtures of twin fock states @xcite , or twin beams , whose density matrix is of the form @xmath17 with all quantum numbers identical between modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , except the wave vectors  which will be exactly matched at the beam splitter ( fig .",
    "[ f : bs ] ) .    equations ( [ e : twinfock],[e : twinbeam ] ) describe perfectly correlated interferometer inputs .",
    "the physics of the hl in this case lies solely in the generalized hong - ou - mandel interference @xcite of the twin fock states ( [ e : twinfock ] ) at a beam splitter .",
    "superpositions or mixtures ( [ e : twinbeam ] ) do not alter the result @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated experimentally using a pair of independently number - squeezed picosecond - pulsed beams from optical fibers @xcite and , more recently , by our group with ultrastable milliwatt - level twin beams emitted by a type ii opo electronically phase - locked at frequency degeneracy @xcite .",
    "good approximations of twin boson modes have also been implemented using internal atomic states of trapped ions @xcite and other proposals include internal atomic states of bose - einstein condensates @xcite and orthogonal phonons in a single trapped ion @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will consider the case of photons , but the reader should bear in mind that the generalization to bosons is mathematically immediate .",
    "some physical analogs of the optical beam splitter are well known : for example , a @xmath18 resonant laser pulse coupling two atomic energy states is isomorphic to a balanced beam splitter overlapping two optical paths .",
    "both are su(2 ) systems and can be described by the schwinger representation @xcite .",
    "a particularity of the holland - burnett scheme lies in its nonconventional detection process .",
    "when a twin mode input is used , the expectation values for the output photon numbers of an interferometer are independent of the phase difference @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "direct detection of the average output intensities , i.e.  of the second - order moment of the input field , can not therefore be used .",
    "the fourth - order moment is phase dependent , as has been noted first by bouyer and kasevich @xcite , however , a simple derivation of the variance of that measurement shows that its signal - to - noise ratio is very low : @xmath19 at best @xcite , which lowers detection accuracy .",
    "coincidence detection can dramatically improve the signal - to - noise ratio of a fourth - order moment measurement and a proof - of - principle experimental demonstration has been carried out for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not clear how to extend coincidence measurements to photon numbers @xmath21 .",
    "what s more , an analysis of coincidence measurements in the presence of detector losses has shown extremely unfavorable results : in particular , it seems that the losses need to be smaller than @xmath2 for this approach to yield even sub - snl results @xcite .",
    "these unfavorable results have cast a doubt on the experimental feasibility of twin - mode hli @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to establish here that such is not the case if one considers the original measurement strategy proposed by holland and burnett , which does not rely on coincidence detection but on a bayesian reconstruction procedure from dynamical photocurrent measurements @xcite .",
    "the present paper thus focuses on bayesian twin - mode interferometry in the presence of detection losses , and on its scaling with the photon number .",
    "the influence of losses on bayesian hli was investigated by numerical simulation in a previous paper @xcite , but the results were limited to low photon numbers ( 100 ) and did not address the question of the scaling of the sensitivity with @xmath0 . in this paper , we carry out numerical simulations of bayesian measurements for photon numbers ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath1 , in the presence of arbitrary detector losses .",
    "the results are very different from the ones obtained for coincidence detection and the prospects for experimental realizations are not as unfavorable as one might have feared from the conclusions of @xcite .    in section ii of this paper ,",
    "we briefly review quantum interferometry and the bayesian measurement procedure . we then present our numerical simulations in section iii and conclude .",
    "all optical interferometers can be modeled using a mach - zehnder model ( fig .",
    "[ f : mz ] ) ,    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     several total input photon numbers were used in the program , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 at efficiencies of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .    for each phase difference specified",
    "there is an associated legendre polynomial evaluated that is used to simulate the detected total photon number and number difference between the detectors .",
    "the losses are computed by operating on the total number of photons in each beam as they exit the second beam splitter using a binomial distribution weighted by the detector efficiency .",
    "the total number of photons on the output ports is simulated using a random possibility to transmit or reflect each photon at the beam splitters , which depends on the phase .",
    "for examples of the probability distributions , or synonymously , phase distributions , see figs .",
    "[ f : graph_modes10000_100 ] and [ f : graph_modes100_99 ] ( note the vertical axes are in arbitrary units that indicate relative probability compared to points on the same phase distribution ) .      all of the figures in this section refer to uncertainties on measurements of phase angles @xmath32 .",
    "this means the data points in each graph refer to the uncertainty in a measurement for a different phase angle from one data point to the next .",
    "the most important results are found for phase differences ranging from zero to a few times @xmath33 .",
    "there is no  optimal \" phase angle in this range , unlike what kim et al",
    ".  found for coincidence detection @xcite . for large phase angles ( @xmath34 ) , one can not acheive better than the snl . further , the uncertainty is found to be quasi - ideal for nonideal quantum detection efficiencies @xmath35 such that @xmath36 we have also found the remarkable result that the phase measurement uncertainty scales as @xmath33 for such nonideal quantum efficiencies , as in the case of 100% efficient detectors .",
    "this defines a margin of experimental conditions within which the phase uncertainty may be further increased below the snl by merely increasing the boson number @xmath0 , but not the efficiency itself ( or the effective photon correlation ) .",
    "even though @xmath37 may be thought of impossible to reach at optical powers , such may not be the case with matter waves , where very high efficiency detection is possible .",
    "while detector efficiencies smaller than @xmath37 do not yield such a favorable scaling of the phase measurement error ( @xmath38 instead of @xmath33 , like squeezing measurements @xcite ) , it is nevertheless found that the bayesian measurement method can always give a better precision than the snl , which , again , was not the case for coincidence detection @xcite . in this regime , the gain in phase error is solely conditioned by the improvement of the effective correlation , as is the case for vacuum squeezing experiments @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the simulation plots . for 100% efficiency ( fig .",
    "[ f : graph100 ] ) the phase error follows @xmath33 as expected and one can also see that both the simulated snl and hl are slightly below @xmath39 or @xmath33 .",
    "c    we attribute this to the averaging process of multiple - burst measurements . in situations involving linear averaging ,",
    "one gets a reduction factor of the noise of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of data samples . in our case",
    ", the measurement probabilities are multiplied together , not averaged .",
    "nevertheless , the results are found to lay within less than an order of magnitude of a line consistent with the hl reduced by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the number of probability distributions , or bursts .    for nonideal efficiencies @xmath42 ( figs .",
    "[ f : graph999 ] to [ f : graph90 ] ) , we find that the phase error follows @xmath33 for low photon numbers before crossing the hl line to follow the snl at @xmath38 .",
    "our simulations indicate that the inflexion point is @xmath43 .",
    "c    c    c    for cases of 90% , 99% , and 99.9% efficiency , as one would expect , scaling occurs as @xmath33 for small @xmath44 , and then rapidly depreciates as photon number increases .",
    "this can be explained by the probability distribution being dependant on the detector efficiency , i.e. the losses in the total photon number . at 99% for 100 photons",
    "one would expect to detect on average 99 photons per measurement , while measuring 10000 photons at an efficiency of 99% naturally produces much larger gross losses , even though the percentage losses are equivalent for the two cases .",
    "the case of 90% efficiency is shown in fig [ f : graph90 ] to illustrate this point .",
    "important to note is that the average error stays below the snl , even for 10000 photons .",
    "between 500 and 10000 one can observe the scaling take on a definite nature of @xmath39 .",
    "the distance below the classical line is within an order of magnitude and is again due to the use of bayes theorem , coupled to the degree of effective correlation determined by the loss level .",
    "it is also important to note that this line is well below the  true \" snl , which is given by @xmath45 all other efficiencies naturally follow this trend .",
    "this leads us to finally consider the particular quantum efficiency @xmath37 of eq .",
    "[ e : eff ] .",
    "the results of the simulations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : graphn ] , which shows , indeed , a behavior comparable to that of the ideal efficiency of fig .",
    "[ f : graph100 ] and has been confirmed for phases within the range of @xmath46 to several times @xmath32 .",
    "c      as the phase angle measured here suggests , in typical experiments the measured phase will need to be within a small range .",
    "as phase angle difference increases one obtains larger error bars on the measured phase , as figure [ f : graph_phivsphi ] indicates .",
    "c    this is true for all efficiencies studied here .",
    "as is clearly evident from the graph , the error bars at higher phase differences are much greater in magnitude than the distance of the measured phase from the line .",
    "the opposite case prevails at low phase differences .",
    "et al _ have suggested that an optimal phase angle exists for each efficiency for which uncertainty is minimized @xcite . however",
    ", if one opts for the bayesian postprocessing of data analyzed here , rather than for coincidence measurements , then evidently there is no optimal phase difference , and any minute phase shift around a multiple of @xmath47 radians can be measured with high confidence .",
    "we have presented a theoretical study of twin fock states incident on a mach - zehnder interferometer , with simulated measurements based on the bayesian probability reconstruction first proposed by holland and burnett @xcite . the lingering question of the scaling of the phase measurement error with the photon number has been elucidated and it has been found that :    @xmath48 one may beat the snl for nonideal detector efficiencies without the signal - to - noise impediment of direct detection of the fourth - order correlation @xcite .",
    "this paves the way to the realization of a sub - snl interferometry experiment with phase - locked twin beams @xcite , an interesting prospect since intensity - difference squeezing is one of the most performant experimental systems available .",
    "@xmath48 nonideal efficiencies can still allow one to reach the hl provided that the losses are of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "such requirements may be too stringent for photon interferometry , but bose - einstein condensates or other atom or trapped - ion experiments may be good candidates .",
    "@xmath48 the problems found with coincidence detection @xcite are not relevant to bayesian twin - mode hli .",
