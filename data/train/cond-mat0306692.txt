    "ferroelectric perovskites pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzn ) and pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2(pmn ) and related materials have recently attracted a great attention , among others , due to the excellent piezoelectric properties@xcite of their solid solutions with pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "their average abo@xmath2 perovskite structure is perturbed by a short - range occupational ordering on b - site positions.@xcite it is known that this nanoscopic inhomogeneity is responsible for relaxor properties of these materials , such as smearing and frequency dependence of the dielectric anomaly associated with the ferroelectric ordering@xcite , and for other phenomena reflecting the presence of polar nanoregions ( pnr ) persisting hundreds of kelvins above the temperature of dielectric permitivity maximum@xcite . unfortunately , it is not easy to deal with these inhomogeneities in a simple enough model , and the understanding of the relaxor properties is not yet satisfactory .",
    "since these materials are available as large single crystals , inelastic neutron scattering can be used to study the phonon dispersion curves .",
    "the spectrum of the lowest frequency transverse excitations usually consists of interacting and mutually repelling transverse acoustic and transverse optic phonon branches .",
    "it is known that upon approaching a displacive ferroelectric phase transition , the lowest zone center optic mode ( soft mode ) tends to zero frequency . instead of that",
    ", it was repeatedly found that near the `` smeared '' phase transition of relaxor ferroelectrics , the upper branch appears to drop precipitously into the lower branch at a finite value of momentum transfer of the order of @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "for explanation of this `` waterfall '' effect , gehring , park and shirane@xcite proposed that the characteristic wave vector @xmath3 corresponds to the size of the pnr s , and that due to these pnr s the soft branch phonons with @xmath6 can not effectively propagate in the crystal .",
    "the idea was subsequently specified within a mode - coupling model@xcite assuming a sharp increase of transverse optic branch damping ( inverse lifetime ) for @xmath7 .      within the past three years",
    ", it was established that the `` waterfall '' effect is common to a number of relaxor ferroelectrics , including pzn@xcite , pmn@xcite , pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 with 8% pbtio@xmath2 ( pzn-8%pt)@xcite , pzn-15%pt@xcite , and pmn-20%pt@xcite .",
    "however , we have noticed that the sharp drop ( near @xmath8@xmath5 ) of the dispersion curves of the single - domain tetragonal batio@xmath2 drawn in fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "strikingly closely reminds those of relaxors ( compare , for example , with fig .  2 of ref .  ) .",
    "obviously , the explanation based on the characteristic size of pnr s can not be valid for an experiment performed on a classic single - domain ferroelectric crystal .",
    "this letter brings new inelastic neutron scattering data showing that such explanation does not hold for relaxors either .",
    "we demonstrate that the `` waterfall '' effect can be ascribed to an entirely classic interference of lineshape anomalies due to the coupled acoustic and optic branches without any _ ad - hoc _ assumption of an anomalous increase of the bare optic branch damping below @xmath3 .    for the experiment we have chosen a 3.7 g single crystal of pzn-8%pt , used already in our previous neutron study@xcite .",
    "this as - grown , optically transparent , yellowish single crystal was produced by the high temperature flux technique at materials research institute , pennsylvania state university .",
    "this promising pzn-8%pt material , showing both relaxor and giant piezoelectric properties , has been studied recently by a number of techniques , and it is the one for which the possible relation of @xmath9 to the size of pnr s was firstly invoked.@xcite    the present experiment was carried out on the recently upgraded in8 thermal neutron spectrometer at the ill high flux reactor .",
    "the instrument was operated with a fixed wave - number of scattered neutrons @xmath10@xmath5 , using horizontally focussing ( vertically flat ) si crystals as monochromator and analyzer .",
    "the sample was wrapped in a thin nb foil and mounted in a vacuum furnace allowing to reach temperatures up to 1200k with a stability better than 1k .",
    "the sample was oriented with the cubic [ 001 ] axis vertical .",
    "this geometry allowed us to explore the @xmath11 scattering plane .",
    "both transverse and longitudinal momentum resolution widths measured on the ( 030 ) bragg reflection were better than 0.07 and 0.06 of reciprocal lattice unit ( rlu , where 1rlu is @xmath12@xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "this is about equivalent to resolution widths in a setup with flat pg ( pyrolitic graphite ) crystals and 40 soller collimators used in the previous studies by other authors .",
    "the present setup using elastically bent si crystals @xcite permits to avoid spurious effects from tails of reflection curves inherent to pg mosaic crystals and provides an improved energy resolution of 0.8mev ( fwhm ) , as given by the energy profile of elastic incoherent scattering from our crystal and confirmed by an independent measurement on a vanadium reference sample .",
    "the typical constant energy transverse scans in the 020 and 030 brillouin zones at 500k are displayed in fig .  1 , and",
    "the positions of their maxima are plotted as solid symbols in fig .  2 .",
    "the apparent dispersion curve obtained in this way from the 020 brillouin zone data has an almost vertical rise up near @xmath13rlu .",
    "this value corresponds exactly to the @xmath3 obtained from the 220 zone data at the same temperature and same crystallographic direction for this material in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , the position of the upward rise observed by us in the 030 brillouin zone is at a significantly smaller value of @xmath14rlu .",
    "as the same [ 010]-polarized modes with wave vectors along [ 100 ] are probed in both brillouin zones , the value of @xmath15 can hardly provide a measure of the size of pnrs@xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the remarkable dependence of @xmath15 on the chosen brillouin zone proves that the observed dispersion is merely an apparent dispersion .",
    "in fact , it is known that maximum intensity positions for response function of coupled damped harmonic phonons can be sensitive to the dynamical structure factors ( chosen brillouin zone).@xcite furthermore , the striking difference between the 030 zone value of @xmath15 and almost the same values of @xmath15 in 020 and 220 zones indicates that the waterfall effect is related to dynamical structure factor of bare _",
    "branch , which is known to be very small in the 030 zone.@xcite    as a matter of fact , it turns out that the `` waterfall effect '' can be reproduced in a quite simple model",
    ". let us consider the standard model@xcite of two coupled damped harmonic oscillators , defined by a @xmath16 dynamical and damping matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 describes dispersion of bare acoustic and optic branches , @xmath22 describes their mutual bilinear interaction , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stands for bare mode frequency independent damping , @xmath25 stands for viscous interaction ( bilinear in time derivatives of bare mode coordinates ) and @xmath26 is the reduced phonon wave vector in a chosen direction ( in this letter , along the cubic [ 100 ] ) . in the high temperature limit ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the corresponding inelastic neutron scattering intensity is proportional to@xcite @xmath28 ~.~ { \\bf f}(q)~,\\ ] ] @xmath29    where * e * is a @xmath16 unit matrix and * f*(q ) is a 2-component vector composed of dynamical structure factors of bare acoustic and optic branches , respectively . at small frequencies ,",
    "it is expected that @xmath30 will assumed in the following .",
    "the wave vector dependence of dynamical matrix @xmath17 can be conveniently cast in the form which appears in the simplest nearest - neighbor interaction models with two degrees of freedom per unit cell@xcite : @xmath31 where the real parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 define the strength of dispersion of bare acoustic and optic branches , the square of soft mode frequency and the strength of mode mixing at zone boundary , respectively .",
    "let us note that the dynamical matrix parametrized in this way shows the same asymptotic behavior for @xmath34 as the standard model of ref .  , and at the same time provides the correct dispersion behavior also at the zone boundary . in the same spirit",
    ", we introduce @xmath35 where the real parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 define the damping of the bare acoustic branch ( with required asymptotic @xmath38 dependence ) and the q- _ independent _ damping of bare optic mode , respectively .",
    "numerical calculations were performed for a set of realistic values ( @xmath39mev@xmath40 , @xmath41mev@xmath40 , @xmath42mev@xmath40 , @xmath43mev@xmath40 , @xmath44mev , @xmath45mev ) .",
    "constant energy profiles calculated for the case of equal bare acoustic and optic structure factors ( @xmath46 ) are shown in fig .  3 , while phonon dispersion curves obtained by diagonalization of the dynamical matrix @xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "4 also shows that the positions of the maximum intensity in constant energy profiles shown in fig .",
    "3 forms an _ apparent dispersion branch _ which follows the acoustic branch for small @xmath26 , but then it sharply rises towards the upper phonon branch near 0.1rlu .",
    "the shape of this apparent dispersion curve indeed corresponds well with the experimental findings shown for example in fig .",
    "as expected , the `` waterfall '' region of the apparent dispersion curve depends noticeably on the dynamical structure factor .",
    "for example , a decrease of the weight of the bare acoustic structure factor shifts the `` waterfall '' position towards the zone center , as it follows from fig .",
    "a similar tendency is found in the experimental data taken in the `` predominantly optic '' 030 brillouin zone ( fig 2 ) . in the limit of zero bare acoustic structure factor ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "the waterfall phenomenon completely disappears ( fig .",
    "5 ) . on the other hand , with a slight change of parameters , the apparent waterfall dispersion curve can attain even a negative slope .",
    "these results show that constant energy scan technique for investigation of coupled acoustic - optic branches should be used with certain caution .",
    "more detailed discussion of the model properties and quantitative analysis of the experimental data is beyond the scope of this letter and will be published elsewhere .    in conclusion , we argue that the `` waterfall '' kink seen on the dispersion curves of several relaxor perovskites can be explained in the framework of coupled damped harmonic oscillator models describing the interaction of the acoustic and optic branches .",
    "this kink only appears on an apparent dispersion curve , obtained from maxima of constant energy sections of scattered intensity , while no such kink is present in the dispersion of bare or coupled branches themselves . in the light of these results",
    ", there is no reason for the position @xmath3 of the waterfall kink to be related to the size of the polar nanoregions .",
    "first of all , there is no need to assume the unusual increase of bare optic branch damping below the waterfall wave vector @xmath3 in the present model .",
    "secondly , the `` waterfall '' position is very sensitive to the dynamical structure factor both in our model and in our experimental data , where it becomes reduced by as much as a factor of 2 when passing from the 020 to 030 brillouin zone .",
    "it also follows that the `` waterfall '' anomaly in the low - energy phonon dispersion is not specific to relaxor ferroelectrics , but it can be encountered in other systems with interacting acoustic and soft optic branches , such as the ferroelectric perovskite batio@xmath2 .",
