    "there are a number of possible theories allowing for the variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath2 . in the simplest cases we take @xmath42 and @xmath43 to be constants and attribute variations in @xmath2 to changes in @xmath44 or the permittivity of free space ( see @xcite for a discussion of the meaning of this choice ) .",
    "this is done by letting @xmath36 take on the value of a real scalar field which varies in space and time .",
    "thus @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimensionless scalar field and @xmath47 is a constant denoting the present value of @xmath36 .",
    "this operation implies that some well established assumptions , like charge conservation , must give way @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the principles of local gauge invariance and causality are maintained , as is the scale invariance of the @xmath46 field ( under a suitable choice of dynamics ) and there is no conflict with local lorentz invariance or covariance .",
    "the dynamics are then constructed as follows .",
    "since @xmath36 is the electromagnetic coupling , the @xmath46 field couples to the gauge field as @xmath48 in the lagrangian and the gauge transformation which leaves the action invariant is @xmath49 rather than the usual @xmath50 the gauge - invariant electromagnetic field tensor is therefore @xmath51which reduces to the usual form when @xmath46 is constant .",
    "the electromagnetic part of the action is still @xmath52and the dynamics of the @xmath46 field are controlled by the kinetic term @xmath53as in dilaton theories . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the characteristic length scale of the theory , introduced for dimensional reasons .",
    "this constant length scale gives the scale down to which the electric field around a point charge is accurately coulombic .",
    "the corresponding energy scale , @xmath55 has to lie between a few tens of mev and the planck scale , @xmath56 gev to avoid conflict with experiment .",
    "this generalisation of the scalar theory proposed by bekenstein @xcite was made by sandvik , magueijo and barrow @xcite and will be referred to as the bsbm theory .",
    "it includes the gravitational effects of @xmath3 and gives the field equations : @xmath57the stress tensor of the @xmath3 field is derived from the lagrangian @xmath58 and the @xmath3 field obeys the equation of motion @xmath59where we have defined the coupling constant @xmath60 .",
    "this constant is of order @xmath61 if , as in @xcite , the energy scale is similar to the planck scale .",
    "it is clear that @xmath62 vanishes for a sea of pure radiation since then @xmath63 .",
    "we therefore expect the variation in @xmath2 to be driven by electrostatic and magnetostatic energy - components rather than electromagnetic radiation and with @xmath64 the fine - structure constant is given by@xmath65    the considerations raised by duff @xcite do not impact upon well - defined varying constant theories like this , even if they appear dimensionful .",
    "the presence of a new field , like @xmath3 , always requires a second - order energy conservation equation , like eq .",
    "( [ boxpsi ] ) and the integration of this equation always leads to a new integration constant , @xmath66 , with the same dimensions as @xmath3 and so the evolution of the dimensionless quantity @xmath67 involves no ambiguities under redefinitions of units .    in order to make quantitative predictions we need to know how much of the non - relativistic matter contributes to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ boxpsi ] ) .",
    "this is parametrised by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the energy density , and for baryonic matter @xmath70 . for protons and neutrons",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 can be estimated from the electromagnetic corrections to the nucleon mass , @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "this correction contains the @xmath75 contribution ( always positive ) , but also terms of the form @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the quarks current ) and so can not be used directly . hence , we take a representative value @xmath78 . furthermore , the cosmological value of @xmath79 ( denoted @xmath80 ) has to be weighted by the fraction of matter that is non - baryonic .",
    "hence , @xmath81 depends strongly on the nature of the dark matter and can take both positive and negative values depending on which of coulomb - energy or magnetostatic energy dominates the dark matter of the universe .",
    "it could be that @xmath82 ( superconducting cosmic strings , for which @xmath83 , or @xmath84 ( neutrinos ) .",

    "thus , depending on the nature of the dark matter , @xmath80 can be virtually anything between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the uncertainties in the underlying quark physics and especially the constituents of the dark matter make it difficult to impose more certain bounds on @xmath80 .",
    "there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from the study of the simple bsbm models with @xmath94 .",
    "these models gave a good fit to the varying @xmath2 implied by the quasar data of refs .",
    "there is just a single parameter to fit and this is given by the choice bsbm @xmath95the simple solutions of the bsbm theory predict a slow ( logarithmic ) time increase of @xmath2 during the dust era of @xmath96 friedmann universes .",
    "the cosmological constant turns off the time - variation of @xmath2 at the redshift when the universe begins to accelerate ( @xmath97 ) and so there is no conflict between the @xmath2 variation seen in quasars at @xmath98 and the limits on possible variation of @xmath2 deduced from the operation of the oklo natural reactor @xcite ( even assuming that the cosmological variation applies unchanged to the terrestrial environment ) .",
    "the reactor operated 1.8 billion years ago at a redshift of only @xmath99 when no significant variations were occurring in @xmath2 .",
    "the slow logarithmic increase in @xmath2 also means that we would not expect to have seen any effect yet in the anisotropy of the microwave backgrounds bat , avelino , spatial : the value of @xmath2 at the last scattering redshift , @xmath100 is only 0.005% lower than its value today .",
    "similarly , the essentially constant evolution of @xmath2 predicted during the radiation era leads us to expect no measurable effects on the products of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite because @xmath2 was only 0.007% smaller at bbn than it is today .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility that unification effects in a more general theory might require variations in weak and strong couplings , or their contributions to the neutron - proton mass difference , which might produce observable differences in light - element nucleosynthesis , and new constraints on varying @xmath0 at @xmath101 by contrast , varying - alpha cosmologies with @xmath102 lead to bad consequences unless the scalar field driving the alpha variations is a ghost field , with negatively coupled kinetic energy , in which case there can be interesting cosmological consequences , @xcite .",
    "the fine structure constant falls rapidly at late times and the variation is such that it comes to dominate the friedmann equation for the cosmological dynamics .",
    "we regard this as a signal that such models are astrophysically ruled out and perhaps are also mathematically badly behaved .",
    "the earlier analyses of the cosmological solutions of the bsbm equations considered the situation in which the scalar field driving variations in @xmath15 has no self - interaction potential , @xmath103 . in this paper",

    "we note that the cases of @xmath108 correspond to @xmath109 , which is equivalent to the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "the solutions for such scenarios were found in our earlier studies and @xmath3 relaxes quickly to a constant asymptotic value once the expansion starts to accelerate .",

    "this case corresponds to the addition of a constant potential @xmath109 for the scalar field and we see that the effect is to turn off all time variations in @xmath3 , and hence @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath237 , originally we had @xmath245 when @xmath246 , and in the radiation - dominated era @xmath247 so we expect the shift to be tiny .",
    "this discussion can be generalized to include a subsequent era dominated by a fluid with general equation of states ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "however , for a matter - dominated era , eqs .",

    "let us now turn to the more general @xmath250 cases .",
    "the effective total potential for the scalar field @xmath3 consists of two parts , the bare potential , @xmath251 and the electromagnetic matter couplings , which depends on @xmath111 , via @xmath252 , so we can combine them as @xmath253 the parameters used in this section are not specifically chosen to reproduce the observed time variation of the fine structure constant ( which we defer to the next section ) , rather here we are concerned with the general dynamics under the effective potential , which might also be useful for models of a scalar field with self - potential coupling to dark matter .",
    "no matter which of the two parts to the scalar effective potential @xmath254dominates , the field @xmath3 will grow at most logarithmically in the radiation era , and ( except @xmath237 ) the only difference between the bare - potential - dominated and the coupling - dominated solutions is the coefficient in front of @xmath255 .",
    "however , if that coefficient is very small then @xmath3 will remain approximately constant during the radiation era , as in bsbm with @xmath256 discussed above .    as it is the radiation era , if the scalar field makes a significant contribution to the energy budget of the universe then @xmath257 ( notice also that @xmath258 which reduces the possible influence of the coupling terms even further ) , and thus @xmath259 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scalar field constitutes only a very small part of the total energy density ( for example , if @xmath260 ) , then @xmath251 might be comparable to , or even much smaller than , @xmath261 .",
    "since the scale factor evolves as @xmath239 whichever part of the effective potential dominates , we shall take this as the leading - order solution to the friedmann equation and look at the evolution of @xmath3 under this condition .",

    "clearly , the larger @xmath265 is , the easier it is for the coupling term on the right hand side to dominate , and the larger @xmath266 is , the easier it is for the potential term to dominate .     as a function of @xmath255 in a radiation - dominated universe .",

    "now suppose that initially the potential term dominates over the coupling term , then because the former scales as @xmath224 while the latter scales as @xmath286 and falls faster , the potential term will become increasingly dominant and the coupling term will never become important .",
    "on the other hand , if initially the coupling term dominates , then the potential term and the coupling term scale as @xmath287 and @xmath288^{-1}$ ] , respectively , and the former always falls off slower than the latter ( however , depending on the value of @xmath160 , the dominance of the potential term could occur very late , much later than the transition to an acceleration era , so probably we will not see this transition during the matter epoch ) .",
    "thus , in this case , the potential term will finally overwhelm the coupling term , and the full solution will then track the no - coupling one .",
    "these features can also be checked numerically .",

    "there are two situations to distinguish and analyse separately : according as to whether or not the scalar - field potential comes to dominate the late - time dynamics of the universe . in combination with the coupling with matter , the additional bare potential forms an effective total potential @xmath321 for the scalar field @xmath3 which governs the allowed time variation of @xmath2 .",

    "the main results are briefly summarized in table 1 , and these results are quite general , not depending on whether the parameters defining the potential ( @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) are extremely large or not .    the consequences for the time evolution of the fine structure constant of adding potentials @xmath251  to the bsbm theory are summarised as follows . in light of the observational constraints on how much variation in @xmath15",
    "there can be over redshifts @xmath381 , we find that the restrictions on the interaction potential parameters ( @xmath160 in the exponential potential and @xmath161 in the inverse power - law potential ) must be very strong , in order to prevent the bare potentials from becoming unacceptably dominant and driving unacceptable fast time variation of @xmath2 .",

    "this means that the @xmath160 and @xmath161 are constrained to be so large that if they appear in quintessence models then the scalar field is practically indistinguishable from a cosmological constant , which has no dynamics at all .",
    "the total variation of @xmath2 can be enhanced compared to the case of no bare potential ( bsbm ) , and the variation commences much earlier . finally ,",
    "because with an exponential or inverse power - law potential the scalar field will not approach a constant even in the dark - energy - dominated era , the fine structure constant @xmath2 will continue to increase for all future time , until eventually there will no stable atoms in the universe at all @xcite .",

    "<S> we generalize the bekenstein - sandvik - barrow - magueijo ( bsbm ) model for the variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath0 to include an exponential or inverse power - law self - potential for the scalar field @xmath1 which drives the time variation of @xmath2 , and consider the dynamics of @xmath3 in such models . </S>",
    "<S> we find solutions for the evolution of @xmath3 or @xmath2 in matter- , radiation- and dark - energy - dominated cosmic eras . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the evolution of @xmath3 is well determined solely by either the self - potential or the coupling to matter , depending on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the results are general and applicable to other models where the evolution of a scalar field is governed by a matter coupling and a self - potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the existing astronomical data stringently constrains the possible evolution of @xmath2 between redshifts @xmath4 and the present , and this leads to very strong limit on the allowed deviation of the potential from that of a pure cosmological constant . </S>"
