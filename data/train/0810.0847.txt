    "the galaxies in the local universe have not evolved in isolation ; rather , their properties have almost certainly been shaped by interactions with other systems .",
    "the currently accepted galaxy formation paradigm is that the large galaxies in the local universe were assembled through the accretion of smaller systems .",
    "the accretion of galactic building blocks was more frequent during early epochs , and simulations suggest that the bulk of the galaxy was in place @xmath7 gyr ago ( e.g. bullock & johnston 2005 ) .    while the frequency of mergers has dropped with time",
    ", the merger rate may have remained high enough that most nearby disk galaxies still experienced significant mergers during the past few gyr ( e.g. hammer et al .",
    "2005 ) . that most spiral galaxies experienced cosmologically recent mergers challenges the classical notions that disks may be too fragile to survive such encounters , and that the inevitable consequence of a major merger is the formation of a pressure - supported system .",
    "however , recent simulations suggest that gas - rich disks may form ( or re - form ) after major mergers involving gas - rich progenitors ( e.g. brook et al . 2007 ; governato et al . 2007 ; robertson et al . 2006 ; springel & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "if such events occurred during relatively recent epochs then the specific angular momenta of disks would be boosted long after the earliest epochs of galaxy assemby .",
    "this could explain the difference between disk sizes predicted by cdm models and those that are observed ( hammer et al . 2007 ) , and the tendency for disk sizes to increase with decreasing redshift ( trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "hammer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that the nearest external spiral galaxy , m31 , is a ` typical ' disk galaxy , in that its disk radius , specific angular momentum , and metallicity have been influenced by comparatively recent interactions / mergers .",
    "indeed , there are a number of signatures of cosmologically recent interactions between m31 and companion galaxies .",
    "these include ( 1 ) a stellar stream ( ibata et al . 2001 ) , ( 2 ) distinct sub - systems in the m31 globular cluster system , that may be indicative of the assimilation of a globular cluster system from a companion ( e.g. beasley et al .",
    "2005 ) , ( 3 ) a pervasive moderately metal - rich intermediate age extraplanar population that might be debris from disrupted satellites or an artifact of an interaction that stirred the disk of m31 ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) , and ( 4 ) the distribution of interstellar material in the disk ( gordon et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "studies of nearby spiral galaxies that are experiencing on - going interactions will provide insight into the role that galaxy - galaxy interactions have played in shaping the properties of systems like m31 , and m81 is an obvious target for such a study .",
    "yun , ho , & lo ( 1994 ) find hi streams linking m81 , m82 , and ngc 3077 , as well as isolated hi clouds , all of which are thought to have formed in response to an encounter between m81 and m82 a few hundred myr in the past .",
    "many of the areas that contain neutral hydrogen also contain stars ( sun et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that more than gas may have been stripped from m81 and/or m82 .",
    "the pedigree of objects like ho ix ( ddo 66 ) and bk 3n , which are embedded in hi streams and are among the closest companions to m81 , is not clear .",

    "still , karachentshev & kaisin ( 2007 ) find that ho ix lies along the sfr - m@xmath9 relation defined by nearby galaxies .",
    "this is a surprising result if ho ix is a tidal dwarf , as its stellar content should then differ from those of long - lived dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies , with the result that its integrated @xmath10band brightness is not a reasonable proxy for total mass when compared with these galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "bk 3n falls well below the fiducial sfr ",
    "m@xmath9 relation , as might be expected if its m@xmath9 is elevated by a very low mass - to - light ratio with respect to galaxies that have a substantial fraction of their light originating from older populations .",
    "in addition to comparatively prominent stellar ensembles like ho ix and bk 3n , the debris field around m81 also contains more subtle stellar accumulations .",

    "they note that the fate of the young stellar systems is not clear ; at one extreme they may herald the birth of a long - lived tidal dwarf galaxy , while at the other they may disperse , thereby forming low - density streams .",
    "davidge ( 2008 ) finds a stellar structure south of m82 that contains stars with ages @xmath12 myr .",
    "the elongated shape of this object , coupled with its low density and close proximity to a much larger galaxy , suggest that it will probably dissipate within a few hundred myr .    in this paper , the wide field capabilities of the cfht megacam are utilised to investigate the distribution of stars in the debris field in and around m81 and m82 .",
    "a novel element of this work is that it is the first wide - field investigation of the debris field between these galaxies to use individual stars , as opposed to integrated light , to search for structures .",
    "resolved stars can be used to probe areas of lower stellar density than is accessible through integrated light studies .",
    "main sequence ( ms ) stars with masses @xmath13 m@xmath14 are of particular interest for such an investigation , as foreground galactic stars and background galaxies with blue colors are rare in the magnitude range of interest . from an astrophysical perspective ,",
    "ms stars in this mass range have the potential of probing areas of star formation in the debris field that date back to the time of the interaction between m81 and m82 .",

    "the observations , reduction procedures , and photometric measurements are discussed in  2 .",
    "the procedure used to probe the distribution of stars in the debris field is described in  3 .",

    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  5 .",
    "the issue of identifying individual stars in the m81 debris field from ground - based images is examined in the appendix using archival hst acs data .",
    "the images used in this study are of a single megacam ( boulade et al .",
    "2003 ) pointing , centered midway between m81 and m82 .",
    "the detector in megacam is a mosaic of thirty six @xmath15 pixel@xmath16 ccds , that together cover an area of one degree@xmath16 with 0.185 arcsec pixel@xmath17 .",
    "the data were recorded on the night of october 23 ut 2006 .",
    "four 300 sec exposures were recorded in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while four 500 sec exposures were recorded in @xmath20 .",
    "the individual exposures were recorded with a square - shaped dither pattern to assist with the identification of bad pixels and the suppression of cosmic rays .",
    "stars have 0.7  0.8 arcsec fwhm in the final processed images , depending on the filter .",
    "the removal of instrumental signatures from the raw images was done with the elixir processing pipeline at the cfht .",
    "this processing included bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and the subtraction of a fringe frame .",
    "the elixir - processed images were then aligned , stacked , and trimmed to the area that is common to all exposures .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting program allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . the psfs , star catalogues , and preliminary photometric measurements used by allstar were obtained from routines in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) package .",
    "the photometry was calibrated using the zeropoints that are computed from standard star observations acquired during each megacam observing run , and which are placed in the data headers during elixir processing .",
    "the raw photometric catalogues were culled to reject objects with poorly determined photometric measurements .",
    "all objects in which the fit error ( @xmath21 ) computed by allstar exceeded 0.3 mag were rejected , and this removed objects near the faint limit of the data , where the photometry is problematic . in addition , objects with an @xmath21 that is markedly higher than that of the majority of objects with comparable magnitude were also removed .",
    "the objects rejected with this step tend to be either ( 1 ) non - stellar , ( 2 ) multi - pixel cosmetic defects , and/or ( 3 ) in crowded environments .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to estimate sample completeness , the scatter in the photometry introduced by the combined effects of random noise and crowding , and the brightness at which blends of fainter stars account for a significant fraction of source detections .",
    "the artificial stars were assigned brightnesses and colors that follow the main locus of bright objects in m81 and m82 . as with actual sources ,",
    "an artificial star was considered to be recovered only if it was detected in at least two filters .",
    "the artificial star measurements were subjected to the fit error filtering procedure that is described in the preceeding paragraph .",
    "as stellar density drops at a given magnitude then ( 1 ) the completeness fraction increases , ( 2 ) the scatter in the photometry decreases , and ( 3 ) the incidence of interloping blends of fainter stars decreases .",
    "the artificial star experiments indicate that blends tend to constitute a significant fraction of stars at magnitudes where the completeness fraction is @xmath22 .",
    "the 50% completeness level occurs near @xmath23 throughtout most of the m81 debris field , although 50% completeness occurs near @xmath24 in ho ix , where the stellar density is comparatively high .",
    "the spatial distribution of objects with photometric properties that match those of bright main sequence ( ms ) stars and red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the m81 debris field are investigated in this section .",
    "concentrations of candidate ms and rsg objects with number densities that exceed those outside of the m81m82 hi debris field are identified .",
    "objects on obvious stellar spiral arms associated with the main body of m81 are not considered .    the brightness and color criteria used to identify ms stars and rsgs",
    "were defined after inspecting the @xmath25 cmds of m81 ( davidge 2008 , in preparation ) and nearby control fields .",
    "objects with @xmath26 between 0.5 and 0.0 and @xmath19 between 22 and 24 were flagged as candidate ms stars .",
    "this region of the @xmath25 cmd has only modest contamination from foreground galactic stars and background galaxies (  4 ) , and so objects that fall within this part of the cmd are adopted as the primary tracers of structure in the debris field .",
    "objects with @xmath26 between 0 and 1 and @xmath19 between 22.5 and 23.5 were flagged as candidate rsgs .",
    "foreground galactic stars and background galaxies tend to have red colors , and the region of the @xmath25 cmd that monitors rsgs is prone to contamination from objects that do not belong to the m81 group .",
    "consequently , candidate rsgs are adopted as secondary tracers of the debris field , as a check of detections made using ms stars .",
    "there is a trade - off between angular resolution and the statistical robustness of source detection ; if the angular resolution is too fine then the ability to detect objects in all but the most densely populated systems is hindered .",
    "conversely , if the angular resolution is too coarse then the contrast between real stellar concentrations and contaminants may diminish , again complicating efforts to detect all but the densest stellar systems . after experimenting with various angular resolutions , a nominal @xmath27 pixel ( @xmath28 arcsec ) binning size for source counts was adopted .",
    "this corresponds to a projected spatial resolution of @xmath29 kpc at the distance of m81 .",
    "a @xmath30 pixel ( @xmath31 arcsec ; @xmath32 kpc ) binning factor was also employed to search for extremely diffuse stellar groupings .",
    "it should be emphasized that these large bin sizes are geared to detect objects that have spatial extents that greatly exceed those of the so - called super star clusters that have been found in interacting galaxies , which are possible progenitor globular clusters and have characteristic sizes of only a few parsecs ( e.g. oconnell 2004 ) .",
    "the main criterion for identifying a stellar grouping is that it contain candidate ms stars with a density on the sky that exceeds that outside of the debris field at the @xmath33 level . while this threshold is stringent , it lowers the chances of triggering detections on statistically ambiguous groupings . as an additional check",
    ", the number density of candidate rsgs within a projected distance of 1 kpc of the ms detection were also investigated .",
    "the 1 kpc radius was adopted because star formation can propogate spatially in stellar systems , so there may not be agreement between the locations of the most recent and previous areas of star formation .",
    "a @xmath34 threshold was adopted for the red objects . the criterion that both candidate ms and rsgs be detected in statistically significant numbers biases against the discovery of extremely young systems , in which rsgs may not be present .    the distribution of hi , as measured by yun et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and candidate ms stars are shown in figure 1 . not surprisingly , the dominant collection of ms stars is m81 .",
    "while m82 is the dominant object in the northern half of the maps , it contains far fewer bright ms stars than m81 .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) the angular resolution of the megacam data is such that individual stars could not be resolved in the dense central starburst of m82 , with the result that sources in this portion of the galaxy were rejected because they had relatively high psf - fitting errors values for their brightness (  2 ) , and ( 2 ) the outer disk of m82 contains few bright main sequence stars ( davidge 2008 , submitted to aj ) . as a consequence , only stars on the periphery of the central star forming region of m82 are seen in figure 1 .",
    "previously identified stellar ensembles including m82 south ( davidge 2008 ) , m81 west ( sun et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the arp loop are clearly seen in figure 1 .",
    "in addition to known objects , three heretofore unidentified groupings were discovered , and the central co - ordinates of these are listed in table 1 .",
    "these objects are referred to as tidal debris objects ( tdos ) 1 , 2 , and 3 for the remainder of the paper .",
    "these objects have so far eluded detection because they are extremely diffuse collections of stars that are distributed over areas spanning many square arcmin .",
    "tdo 1 is 6 arcmin ( 5.5 kpc ) from ho ix , and 13.4 arcmin ( 14 kpc ) from m81 .",
    "it is not connected to ho ix by a detectable bridge of blue stars .",
    "still , the yun et al . ( 1994 ) hi data indicates that ho ix and tdo 1 are probably part of the same hi complex .",
    "tdo 1 is in the area studied by durrell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and their figure 1 confirms that the region near tdo 1 and tdo 2 contains a local over - density of blue stars , although the stellar density is not as high as in the cluster they find in the hi south tidal arm .",
    "tdo 2 is a pronounced concentration of blue objects immediately to the south and west of tdo 1 .",
    "it is 15.5 arcmin ( 17 kpc ) from the center of m81 , and is 8.5 arcmin ( 9 kpc ) south of ho ix .",
    "it is near the southern end of the hi complex that contains ho ix .",
    "tdo 3 is on the major axis of m81 , 16 arcmin ( @xmath35 kpc ) from the center of the larger galaxy , and is 5.5 arcmin ( @xmath36 kpc ) from the area identified as m81 west by sun et al .",
    "tdo 3 coincides with a concentration of hi emission in the tidal arm that also hosts m81 west ( yun et al .",
    "the central panel of figure 1 shows that there are no blue stars between tdo 3 and m81 west , indicating that they are independent stellar concentrations .",

    "( 2007 ) discuss galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) images of nearby galaxies , including m81 , and these data can be used to gain further insight into the new stellar groupings . more specifically , if tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 are relatively young systems then they might be sites of diffuse uv emission , such as is seen in the arp loop or holmberg ix .",
    "a portion of the 1516  image of m81 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "all three of the newly discovered structures are sources of uv emission , and are clearly detached from the main body of m81 , as expected if they are independent entities . moreover ,",
    "the newly discovered structures have uv morphologies that are similar to the arp loop , which contains young stars ( e.g. de mello et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the comparisons in figure 2 are thus consistent with the new stellar groupings being concentrations of young stars .    in addition to the stellar groupings discussed above",
    ", the right hand panel of figure 1 shows enhancements in the density of blue stars outside of the main body of m81 , and some of these coincide with features in the yun et al .",
    "( 1994 ) hi data .",
    "three specific enhancements of blue sources coincide with hi concentrations , and these are located at ( @xmath37 ) , ( @xmath38 ) , and ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the first of these is a band of stars that extends a few arcmin to the east of the arp loop , while the second is a complex of stars that spans @xmath40 arcmin and is located to the north and west of tdo 3 .",
    "the third is a spur @xmath41 arcmin long and 3 arcmin wide that originates in the main body of m81 and passes @xmath42 arcmin south of bk 3n . the density of candidate ms stars in these areas is lower than in tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 , and the diminished contrast with respect to foreground stars and background galaxies complicates efforts to investigate the stellar contents of these areas . for the present study the presence of these features",
    "is simply noted , and their stellar contents are not investigated .",
    "images with higher angular resolution would be helpful for distinguishing between faint galaxies and stars in these regions .",

    "different control fields were used for each tdo , and the locations of the control fields are marked in figure 1 . aside from differences in the numbers of objects , the control field cmds are very similar , suggesting that the control fields sample a common population of objects ( mainly background galaxies ) , and that the distribution of objects on the cmds are not affected by stochastic effects or cosmic variance .",
    "there is a clear over - density of blue and red objects in the tdo cmds , as expected given the criteria for identifying stellar concentrations in the debris field (  3 ) . while there are background galaxies and foreground stars within the boundaries of the tdos that masquerade as rsgs , the @xmath25 cmds of the control fields are largely free of objects with @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , the brightest objects with blue colors in the tdo cmds have a strong likelihood of being luminous ms stars ; that these objects are probably point sources , as opposed to blended stellar asterisms or distant compact galaxies , is demonstrated in the appendix . finally , the @xmath25 cmd of tdo 3 contains a population of objects with @xmath46 and @xmath47 that is not seen in the control fields , and these are candidate agb stars .",

    "all three tdos contain relatively young stars .",
    "the mean color and brightness of the ms turn - off ( msto ) in their @xmath25 cmds is consistent with log(t ) = 7.5  7.7 .",

    "2007 ) , then the tdos have integrated magnitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 . a total area of 43000 arcsec@xmath16 was probed in tdo 1 , and so the mean surface brightness is 28.1 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath66 and 25.8 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath67 . as for tdo 2 ,",
    "an area of 10500 arcsec@xmath16 was studied , so that the mean surface brightness is 26.6 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath66 , and 24.3 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath67 .",
    "finally , 25000 arcsec@xmath68 was investigated in tdo 3 , so the mean surface brightness is 27.5 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath66 and 25.2 mag arcsec@xmath3 in @xmath67 .",
    "images obtained with the cfht megacam have been used to investigate the distribution of bright stars in the m81 debris field .",
    "a novel aspect of this work is that individual stars , rather than integrated light , are used to search for structure .",
    "such a search is made possible by the large megacam science field , combined with the sub - arcsec angular resolution of these data .",
    "a significant benefit of using individual stars is that objects that have photometric properties that are relatively common among stars in the m81 group , but are rare among foreground galactic stars and background galaxies , can be selected to enhance sensitivity .",
    "an unfortunate drawback is that the current search is restricted to intrinsically bright , inherently rare , stars .",
    "deeper studies will allow structure in the debris field to be better defined .",
    "the search uses sources with blue colors in a magnitude range that contains massive ms stars and blue supergiants in the m81 group .",
    "this was supplemented with a secondary search geared towards detecting objects with colors and magnitudes that are appropriate for rsgs . while rare , background galaxies with colors that are similar to those of massive ms stars are still present , and galaxy clusters that contain a mix of unreddened star - forming galaxies and redder galaxies are one source of contamination in the present search .",
    "in fact , two clumps of blue and red sources that are made up of obviously extended objects were found that met the threshold criteria for detection .",
    "bright main sequence stars are found throughout the m81 debris field , and three previously unidentified young stellar concentrations are discovered .",
    "the area considered here does not include the candidate tidal dwarf identified by durrell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the hi south tidal arm . still , the three objects found here are similar to that cluster , both in terms of spatial extent ( @xmath6 kpc ) and age .",
    "the distribution of star clusters on the @xmath69 diagram suggests that there was a period of elevated star formation throughout the m81 disk a few tens of myr in the past ( figure 3 of chandar , tsvetanov , & ford 2001 ) .",
    "this may also have been the case in the tidal debris field .",
    "the ages estimated for the brightest ms and rsg stars indicate that tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 , as well as other objects such as ho ix , have been forming stars for at least some fraction of the past @xmath5 myr .",
    "the time interval over which tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 have been forming stars is the typical timescale for elevated levels of star - forming activity in starburst galaxies ( e.g. marcillac et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the young stars in the tdos could have formed _ in situ _ , as the gas density exceeds the kennicutt ( 1989 ) threshold .",
    "using the adler & westpfahl ( 1996 ) rotation curve for m81 , the threshold gas density for star formation , @xmath70 , near tdo 1 and 2 is @xmath71 m@xmath14 pc@xmath3 , while for tdo 3 @xmath72 m@xmath14 pc@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to hi densities @xmath73 cm@xmath3 for tdo 1 and 2 , and @xmath75 cm@xmath3 for tdo 3 .",
    "the observed hi densities in the vicinity of the tdos comfortably exceed these values ( e.g. yun et al .",
    "1994 ; adler & westpfahl 1996 ) .",
    "the newly discovered systems contain ms and and rsg stars that , based on comparisons with isochrones , have different ages ; hence , they appear to be composite systems , as opposed to simple stellar systems . however , could the rsg sequences in the tdo cmds be part of a stellar system that is not associated with the ms stars , such as a diffuse population of rsgs pulled from the m81 disk ?",
    "the answer to this question is a qualified ` no ' .",
    "a requirement in the search procedure employed here is that stellar concentrations show up as statististically significant groupings of both blue and red objects .",
    "a caveat is that offsets between ms and rsg groupings on the order of kpc and smaller scales were tolerated , since areas of star formation can propogate spatially .",
    "therefore , the rsgs are not part of a diffuse population that has been pulled from m81 or m82 .",
    "still , there is no evidence other than a small projected separation that the ms and rsg components are physically related , and hence are part of a single ` system ' .",
    "mirabel , dottori , & lutz ( 1992 ) find a dwarf galaxy - like structure in a tidal tail emerging from ngc 4038/39 , and the formation of such ` tidal dwarfs ' is predicted by simulations of galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "tidal dwarfs form from gas - rich debris and have only modest dark matter contents when compared with traditional galaxies that formed in the heart of dark matter halos ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; wetzstein , naab , & burkert 2007 ) .",
    "simulations run by cox et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that fragments from tidal interactions may last only a few hundred myr .    despite not having a large dark matter component ,",
    "tidal dwarfs may not be disrupted quickly by feedback , and recchi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that star formation may continue for hundreds of myr , or until the system is destroyed by tidal forces .",
    "in fact , the majority of objects that form in debris fields are probably not long - lived , as there appears to be only a limited region of parameter space in which tidal dwarfs can survive for even a fraction of the hubble time .",
    "bournaud & duc ( 2006 ) find that only 10  20% of tidal dwarfs survive up to 10 gyr , and even then only if the interaction geometries are favourable . many of the dwarfs formed in their simulations disperse within a few hundred myr , and the longest - lived tidal structures are those in which the orbits of the interacting galaxies are coplanar to within 40@xmath76 , so that tidal features form close to the disk planes .",
    "the longest lived tidal dwarfs in the bournard & duc ( 2006 ) simulations have masses @xmath77 m@xmath14 .",
    "metz & kroupa ( 2007 ) find that systems with masses 10@xmath78 m@xmath79 may also survive , albeit as low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals ( see also kroupa 1998 ) .",
    "the locations of tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 in the hi debris field , coupled with the disk - like metallicities of the brightest stars and the density of gas in the regions around these objects , which exceeds that necessary to trigger star formation ( see above ) , suggests that they may have formed from tidal debris .",
    "tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 may thus be considered to be tidal dwarfs , although the reader should keep in mind that they are probably destined to be  at least by cosmological standards  short - lived structures , surviving less than @xmath6 gyr . with m@xmath1 (  4 ) , then tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 have masses @xmath80 m@xmath14 , and so are less massive than the long - lived tidal dwarfs that have been found in simulations to survive for long periods .",
    "lacking knowledge of the orbital paths of the tdo objects with respect to m81 , and the kinematics of individual stars within these systems , it can not be said with certainty whether or not they are dissipating .",
    "still , assuming a m / l ratio = 0.2 , which is appropriate for an age of 100 myr ( mouhcine & lancon 2003 ) , and a total mass of @xmath81 m@xmath82 for m81 ( schroder et al . 2002 ) then the tidal radii of the tdos fall between 100 and 200 kpc .",
    "this is significantly larger than their projected separations from m81 , suggesting that they are prone to disruption .",
    "streams of material originating from tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 would be one signature of this happening .",
    "while there is no evidence in the megacam data for stellar streams , such features may be too diffuse to detect without going significantly fainter .",
    "a number of stellar groupings have previously been identified in the m81 debris field , and the star - forming histories of these are of interest for understanding not only the evolution of the tdo objects , but also of the debris field in general .",
    "many of the previously discovered objects fall inside the megacam science field , and so it is possible to compare their cmds with those of the tdo objects .",
    "the cmds of all three tdos are similar to those of ho ix , bk 3n , and m81 west at the bright end (  4 ) , indicating similarities in their recent star - forming histories and mean metallicities .",
    "these similarities suggest that star formation throughout the tidal debris field was triggered by common events , presumably related to the encounter between m81 and m82 . in the case of ho ix ,",
    "tdo 1 , and tdo 2 , the similarity in stellar content and metallicity is perhaps not surprising , given their close proximity .",
    "in fact , that they are located in the same hi complex suggests that these systems probably formed in the same tidal arm .",
    "karachentsev & kaisin ( 2007 ) use the integrated properties of ho ix and bk 3n to investigate their evolution . with the caveat that the hi mass associated with a stellar system in the debris field is hard to determine with confidence since some ( or all ) of the hi along the line of sight may not belong physically to the object in question , karachentsev & kaisin ( 2007 ) estimate the rate of consumption of hi in a number of m81 group galaxies based on the present sfr , and construct a diagram that compares the past and projected fuel consumption rates normalized to the available gas .",
    "the position of ho ix and bk 3n on this diagram suggests that they have enough gas to fuel star formation for some time to come if they maintain their present sfr . for comparison",
    ", the location of m82 and many m81-group spirals and dwarf irregulars on this diagram suggest that they will deplete their gas reservoirs within a hubble time if they continue to form stars at their current rates .",
    "the rosey prognosis for sustainable star formation in ho ix is not a consequence of a low sfr .",
    "indeed , karachentsev & kaisin ( 2007 ) find that ho ix falls on the sfr - m@xmath9 relation defined by nearby galaxies .",
    "if , as suggested by photometric studies , ho ix is a young stellar system , then adjusting its integrated brightness to account for its age when compared with traditional long - lived dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies will shift it to a region of the sfr - m@xmath9 diagram that falls above the fiducial relation . that a large gas reservoir is associated with ho ix",
    "is qualitatively consistent with the gas - rich nature of tidal dwarfs predicted by wetzenstein et al .",
    "that ho ix , bk 3n , m81 west , and the three tdo systems have similar metallicities , despite differences in their integrated brightness , is also consistent with a tidal dwarf origin .",
    "the m81 debris field may provide clues into the origin of stars that are seen in the extraplanar regions of other galaxies .",
    "mouhcine ( 2006 ) investigates the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) of stars in the outer regions of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "the mdfs contain a tail of metal - poor stars that he suggests may have originated in dwarf galaxies or protogalactic fragments that formed either outside of the influence of the dark matter halo of the host spirals , or before the dominant dark matter halo was assembled .",
    "the characteristic metallicity of the extraplanar component also is seen to increase with galaxy luminosity , suggesting that  unlike the metal - poor stars  the more metal - rich stars in the mdf formed within the dark matter halo of the dominant galaxy , as their chemical enrichment was evidently influenced by the depth of the potential well of the host spiral .",
    "mouhcine ( 2006 ) suggests that the metal - rich stars in the mdf of the target galaxies originated in globular clusters .",
    "however , could these stars have come from the disk , as a result of tidal stripping or heating due to tidal interactions ? if , as argued by hammer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the majority of spiral galaxies have experienced mergers during the past @xmath83 gyr then the tidal stirring of disks is not a rare event . some of the galaxies in the mouhcine sample are viewed almost edge - on , and figure 1 of mouchine ( 2005 ) indicates that in some cases the sampled fields extend only a few vertical disk scale lengths off of the disk plane .",
    "in fact , the fields observed by mouhcine ( 2006 ) probe extraplanar distances that are similar to those where metal - rich stars are prevalent in m31 ; the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of these stars indicate that they are not part of the classical halo in m31 ( kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ; chapman et al .",
    "the spatial distribution of the metal - rich stars in extragalactic spirals will provide clues as to their origin .",
    "if the metal - rich component defines a flattened system then this would be consistent with a disk origin .",
    "in contrast , a centrally concentrated spheroidal or near - spheroidal distribution would be more consistent with an origin tied to the bulge and/or its associated globular clusters .",
    "blending is an obvious consideration when observing intrinsically bright stars in extragalactic systems . in the m81 group",
    ", one arcsec corresponds to a projected distance of 17.6 parsec , and so numerous stars inevitably fall within the megacam seeing disk .",
    "this being said , the nature of the stellar luminosity function is such that the vast majority of these objects are intrinsically faint , so that the impact on the photometry of bright stars is often insignificant . in the current study ,",
    "the impact of contamination from other stars within the seeing disk is mitigated somewhat by the relatively low stellar density in the m81 debris field .",
    "that the ages estimated for ho ix and bk 3n from the brightest main sequence stars and rsgs are consistent with those obtained from hst data suggests that blending is not an issue .",
    "indeed , the stellar densities in tdo 1 , 2 , and 3 are lower than in ho ix and bk 3n , and so the incidence of blending will be even lower in these systems .",
    "could the blue sources that are the basis of the search for stellar groupings be stellar asterisms or background galaxies ?",
    "this question can be answered by examining the blue sources in hst images . here ,",
    "we consider deep f814w acs images of the southern portion of the arp loop , which were recorded as part of program 10915 ( pi j. dacanton ) .",
    "these data are well suited for this task because ( 1 ) the arp loop contains a number of blue sources in a relatively compact area , and ( 2 ) they were recorded with moderately long exposure times , thereby assisting in the identification of faint galaxies .",
    "six blue stars were detected by megacam in a @xmath84 arcmin@xmath16 region that is located midway between the fuv sources 6 and @xmath85 discussed by de mello et al .",
    "a @xmath86 arcsec section of the acs f814w image , centered on each of these stars , is shown in figure a1 . in each case",
    "there is a dominant central point source , which is the star that was identified by megacam . at the angular resolution of the acs data ,",
    "the central stars appear to be point sources , and hence are not compact star clusters or obvious background galaxies .",
    "four of the six stars have an obvious companion within @xmath6 arcsec , and these companions also appear to be point sources .",
    "the presence of such companions is perhaps not surprising given that the arp loop is , at least by the standards of the m81 debris field , a comparatively high density environment .",
    "this being said , the companions are much fainter than the central star , with the smallest magnitude difference between the central source and the companion being 1.7 magnitudes .",
    "moreover , only in one case does the companion fall within the seeing disk ( fwhm @xmath87 arcsec ) of the megacam data .",
    "the acs data are thus consistent with the blue sources in the megacam data being intrinsically bright main sequence stars .",
