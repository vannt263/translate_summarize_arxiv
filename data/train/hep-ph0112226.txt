    "the cpt theorem @xcite is one of the milestones of local quantum field theory .",
    "it is based on such general principles as lorentz invariance , the connection of spin and statistics , and the locality and hermiticity of the lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath1 standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) , for which the cpt theorem is valid , is in very good agreement with all existing experimental data . beyond the sm , like in string theory models or in models involving extra dimensions ,",
    "cpt invariance could be violated @xcite .",
    "thus , the search for possible effects of cpt violation is connected to the search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "many different tests of cpt invariance have been carried out .",
    "so far , no cpt violation has been found and rather strong bounds on the corresponding parameters have been obtained @xcite .",
    "one of the basic consequences of the cpt theorem is the equality between the masses of particles and their corresponding antiparticles .",
    "a strong bound on a possible violation of cpt invariance has been obtained from the @xmath2-@xmath3 system .",
    "this violation is characterized by the parameter @xmath4 which can be related to measurable quantities @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses and the total decay widths of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , respectively , and @xmath10 is the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian of the @xmath2-@xmath11 system in the representation @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are eigenstates of the hamiltonian of strong and electromagnetic interactions . for the complex diagonal matrix elements , we have @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the bare masses and the total decay widths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons , respectively , with corrections due to weak interactions .",
    "the cplear experiment obtained @xcite @xmath18 using all relevant data on the @xmath2-@xmath19 system , it follows that @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "recently , also an upper bound on the mass difference between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons has been obtained @xcite @xmath24    here , we will consider possible cpt invariance tests that can be performed in future high - precision experiments with neutrinos from neutrino factories , which are now under active investigation @xcite .",
    "they have mainly been proposed to study neutrino oscillations in detail .",
    "in addition , in the framework of lorentz non - invariant models , possible cpt invariance tests with neutrino experiments have been discussed ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations has been found by atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "the following best - fit value for the atmospheric mass squared difference @xmath25 has been obtained @xcite : @xmath26 from the global analysis of all solar neutrino data , several allowed regions in the neutrino oscillation parameter space have been found . for the preferred so - called large mixing angle ( lma ) solution in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solar mass squared difference has been determined to be @xmath27 furthermore , there are at present indications for neutrino oscillations with an even larger mass squared difference , which were found by the lsnd experiment @xcite . from the analysis of the data of the lsnd experiment , the best - fit value of the neutrino mass squared difference @xcite @xmath28 was found .",
    "the strongest kinematical bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath29 is obtained from the endpoint of the @xmath30-spectrum of @xmath31 .",
    "the latest measurements yielded @xmath32 @xcite . from neutrinoless double @xmath30-decay",
    "there exists also a strong bound @xmath33 for majorana masses ( for an overview see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath34 are matrix elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , somewhat weaker but similar bounds emerge from astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "it nevertheless follows from the existing neutrino data that neutrino masses are not equal to zero and that they are much smaller than the masses of all other fundamental fermions ( leptons and quarks ) . from empirical lepton and",
    "quark mass patterns a hierarchical ( or inverse hierarchical ) mass pattern seems to be rather plausible @xcite .",
    "it is a general belief that the smallness of the neutrino masses requires some new mechanism beyond the sm .",
    "the classical mechanism of neutrino mass generation is the see - saw mechanism @xcite , which connects the smallness of the neutrino masses with the violation of lepton numbers at an energy scale much higher than the electroweak scale . in this case ,",
    "massive neutrinos have to be majorana particles and the neutrino masses have to satisfy a hierarchy relation .",
    "the see - saw mechanism is based on local quantum field theory , and therefore , violation of cpt invariance can not be expected .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been suggested @xcite that the smallness of the neutrino masses could have a natural explanation in models with large extra spatial dimensions .",
    "in such models , the smallness of the dirac neutrino masses follows from the suppression of yukawa interactions of the left - handed neutrino fields , localized on a three - dimensional brane , and the singlet right - handed neutrino fields propagating together with the gravitational field in a bulk . in models with @xmath37 extra dimensions ,",
    "the neutrino masses are proportional to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the volume of the extra space , @xmath40 is the planck mass , and @xmath41 is the planck mass in the @xmath42 dimensional space",
    ". moreover , there are other approaches to the generation of small dirac or majorana neutrino masses in models with extra dimensions ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "since the symmetries of the sm are violated in the bulk , neutrino mass generation in extra dimension models is a plausible candidate for the violation of cpt invariance @xcite .    in order to accommodate all existing neutrino oscillation data , including the data of the lsnd experiment , it is necessary to have three independent mass squared differences .",
    "thus , we need to assume that there exist ( at least ) four massive mixed neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , in addition to the three active flavors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 at least one sterile neutrino has to exist @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was assumed that cpt violation in the neutrino sector can be so strong that the mass spectra of neutrinos @xmath46 and antineutrinos @xmath47 are completely different . in this case , it is possible to describe atmospheric , solar , and lsnd neutrino data with a framework of three massive neutrinos and three massive antineutrinos ( assuming that @xmath48 belongs to the antineutrino spectrum ) .",
    "such an extreme picture can , in principle , be tested by the future miniboone @xcite , kamland @xcite , and other similar neutrino experiments @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of a term in the neutrino hamiltonian violating cpt and lorentz invariance has been considered and the @xmath49 and @xmath50 transition probabilities with the @xmath44 and @xmath51 coming from neutrino factories have been calculated .",
    "it was demonstrated that in such a model the effects of cpt violation could be rather large in a wide range of the corresponding parameter values .",
    "in this paper , we will assume lorentz invariance and consider possible violation of cpt invariance by the mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "in the case of the usual neutrino mixing , we have @xmath52 where @xmath35 is a unitary mixing matrix and @xmath53 are the neutrino fields ( dirac or majorana ) with masses @xmath54 . the neutrino flavor state @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the neutrino states with masses @xmath36 , negative helicity @xmath58 , 3-momentum @xmath59 , and energy @xmath60 in the ultra - relativistic limit .  ) , the mixing matrix elements @xmath61 are defined for neutrino fields @xmath62 in coordinate space .",
    "neutrino flavor states @xmath63 ( in momentum space ) are , however , created from the vacuum by creation operators of definite momentum .",
    "the transition from coordinate space to momentum space explains why the @xmath64 s show up in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nustate ] ) . ] for the antineutrino flavor state @xmath65 we have @xmath66 in the case of dirac neutrinos and @xmath67 in the case of majorana neutrinos . in these relations , @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "are the right - handed antineutrino and majorana neutrino states , respectively , which also have the 3-momentum @xmath59 and the energy @xmath70 .    assuming the usual lorentz invariant propagation of neutrino states for the neutrino and antineutrino transition probabilities in vacuum",
    ", we find the expressions @xmath71 and @xmath72 which automatically satisfy the relation @xmath73 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : paa ] ) and ( [ eq : apaa ] ) , @xmath74 is the mass squared difference , @xmath75 is the distance between the source and detector , and @xmath76 is the neutrino energy .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : p = p ] ) is a consequence of cpt invariance inherent to standard neutrino mixing and oscillations .",
    "if the generation mechanism of neutrino masses and mixings violates cpt invariance , then the relations for antineutrino flavor states will differ from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : antidirac ] ) and ( [ eq : antimajorana ] ) . in the case of massive dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the antineutrino masses @xmath77 will be different from the neutrino masses @xmath36 , and the mixing matrices will , in general , not be connected by complex conjugation .",
    "thus , for the antineutrino flavor states we have @xmath78 cpt tests at neutrino factories -------------------------------    in this section , we will investigate the sensitivity of future high - precision neutrino oscillation experiments at neutrino factories to neutrino - antineutrino mass and mixing angle differences .",
    "neutrino factories @xcite will allow to investigate the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations , which has been observed by the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments , with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "it will be possible to determine the leading neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 governing the @xmath81 oscillations in the atmospheric region very well . depending on their values , it will also be possible to limit or to measure the mixing angle @xmath82 to search for the connected matter effects and to discriminate between a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum and a mass spectrum with reversed hierarchy . in the most likely lma case ,",
    "the effects of cp violation in the lepton sector can be studied .",
    "details of neutrino factory phenomenology can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . as we will show below ,",
    "because of the high precision of neutrino factories , we can estimate the sensitivity of experiments to the presumably small violations of cpt invariance in the neutrino sector , being an unambiguous sign of new physics .    at neutrino factories neutrinos will be produced in muon decays @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) .",
    "the straightforward way to test cpt invariance at neutrino factories would be to check the appearance relation @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) with neutrinos from @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) decays .",
    "however , such tests would require to measure the sign of the charge of the produced lepton .",
    "the sign of a muon charge can be determined very reliably , but measuring the sign of an electron ( or positron ) charge is a rather challenging problem . the possibility to measure the electron ( or positron ) charge with moderate efficiency with liquid argon detectors would not be precise enough .",
    "therefore , we consider a cpt invariance test in the @xmath44 and @xmath51 disappearance channels by checking the equality @xmath89 the @xmath44 and @xmath51 disappearance channels have several advantages :    1 .",
    "the effect of neutrino oscillations in the atmospheric mass squared difference region is large .",
    "2 .   the matter effects are small .",
    "3 .   there is no relevant background from the @xmath90 s ( @xmath43 s ) , which are accompanying the @xmath44 s ( @xmath51 s ) in the decays of the @xmath88 s ( @xmath87 s ) .",
    "the event rates are high for obtaining good statistical information .",
    "we will only consider the possible violation of cpt invariance in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 oscillations .",
    "if cpt invariance is violated , then these oscillations will be characterized by the leading parameters @xmath91 , @xmath80 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a comprehensive study of the accuracy of the measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters in neutrino factory experiments was performed .",
    "our calculations will be based on this study . since matter effects give only small contributions to the @xmath44 and @xmath51 survival probabilities , uncertainties in the earth matter density profile are of little importance for the parameter measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .  3 ,",
    "the relative statistical errors of the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 , determined by a general analysis including correlations , are plotted as functions of the luminosity @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of stored muons per year and @xmath98 is the mass of the detector in kilotons .",
    "violation of cpt invariance in neutrino oscillations can be characterized by the following parameters : @xmath99 if the minimal neutrino mass @xmath29 and the cpt violating effects are small ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , then we find for the hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum or the spectrum with reversed hierarchy that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the violation of cpt invariance .",
    "we can also write @xmath104 as @xmath105 where @xmath106 the experimental sensitivity to the possible cpt violation is given by the accuracy with which the parameters @xmath107 and/or @xmath108 can be measured . in order to estimate the sensitivity we will treat the neutrino and antineutrino channels as different experiments which are not combined to fit a common @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in order to establish an effect we therefore need to compare the values of the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which are describing the asymmetry between these two experiments , with the corresponding statistical errors of the neutrino oscillation parameters determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "3 . only if the mass squared or mixing angle difference between neutrinos and antineutrinos is larger than the respective relative statistical error @xmath111 or @xmath95 of the measurement of @xmath79 or @xmath110 , cpt violation will be detectable on the respective confidence level of the statistical evaluation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sensitivities @xmath112 and @xmath113 to the cpt violating parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 are given by :    @xmath116    [ eq : abrel ]    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the factor of two in the first relation comes from the translation from mass squared differences to masses for a hierarchical ( or inverse hierarchical ) mass spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acptrel ] ) . as an example , a statistical error of @xmath119 in the determination of @xmath120 would correspond to a mass asymmetry sensitivity between neutrinos and antineutrinos of @xmath121 .",
    "the sensitivities described by eqs .",

    "the respective statistical errors were calculated for a muon energy of @xmath124  gev and for a baseline length of @xmath125  km .",
    "similarly , the dashed curve shows the sensitivity @xmath126 to the asymmetry @xmath108 , with the statistical errors calculated for @xmath124  gev and @xmath127  km . from these curves , one can , for example , read off for a @xmath128 detector and @xmath129 stored muons per year during 5 years ( _ cf .",

    "we then obtain for a hierarchical or inverse hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum @xmath132 .",
    "cpt is a fundamental symmetry preserved in any lorentz invariant local quantum field theory .",
    "especially , the sm is a cpt invariant theory .",
    "however , cpt invariance can be violated in models beyond the sm , like models with extra dimensions or string theory models .",
    "it is important to note that the expected effects of cpt violation depend on the assumed model .",
    "if the planck mass is close to the tev scale , such as it is for models with large extra dimensions , these effects could be observable in future experiments .",
    "we especially addressed the question of cpt violation by small neutrino mass or mixing angle differences between neutrinos and antineutrinos , which could , most plausibly , be generated by a mechanism beyond the sm .",
