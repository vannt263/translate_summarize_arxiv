    "the bending of light was the first experimental confirmation of the theory of general relativity .",
    "nowadays , gravitational lensing is one of the most important tools in astronomy and cosmology .",
    "it is widely used for investigating extrasolar planets , dark matter , and dark energy .",
    "light bending is also of theoretical importance , in particular for studying a null structure of a spacetime .",
    "a rigorous form of the bending angle plays an important role in properly understanding a strong gravitational field @xcite . for example , strong gravitational lensing in a schwarzschild black hole was considered by frittelli , kling , and newman @xcite and by virbhadra and ellis @xcite ; virbhadra and ellis @xcite later described strong gravitational lensing by naked singularities ; eiroa , romero , and torres @xcite treated reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing ; perlick @xcite discussed lensing by a barriola - vilenkin monopole and also by an ellis wormhole .",
    "one of the peculiar features of general relativity is that the theory admits a nontrivial topology of a spacetime ; for instance , a wormhole .",
    "an ellis wormhole is a particular example of the morris - thorne traversable wormhole class @xcite .",
    "many years ago , scattering problems in such spacetimes were discussed ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "one remarkable feature is that the ellis wormhole has zero mass at the spatial infinity , but it causes light deflection @xcite .",
    "moreover , gravitational lensing by wormholes has been recently investigated as an observational probe of such an exotic spacetime @xcite .",
    "several forms of the deflection angle by the ellis wormhole have been recently derived and often used @xcite .",
    "a reason for such differences has been clarified @xcite .    according to recent numerical calculations by abe @xcite , time - symmetric demagnification parts in light curves could appear by gravitational microlensing effects of the ellis wormhole . is the time - symmetric demagnification evidence for the ellis wormhole",
    "? is is very interesting to address this question .",
    "one reason is that wormholes are inevitably related with violations of some energy conditions in physics @xcite .",
    "for instance , dark energy is introduced to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe by means of an additional energy - momentum component in the right - hand side of the einstein equation .",
    "furthermore , the left - hand side of the einstein equation , equivalently the einstein - hilbert action , could be modified in various ways ( nonlinear curvature terms , higher dimensions , and so on ) inspired by string theory , loop quantum gravity , and so on .",
    "because of the nonlinear nature of gravity , modifications to one ( or both ) side(s ) of the einstein equation might admit spacetimes significantly different from the standard schwarzschild spacetime metric , even if the spacetime is assumed to be asymptotically flat , static , and spherically symmetric .",
    "one example is an ellis wormhole ( being an example of traversable wormholes ) .",
    "inspired by a huge number of modified theories , this brief paper assumes , in a phenomenological sense , that an asymptotically flat , static , and spherically symmetric modified spacetime could depend on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak - field approximation .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime and the ellis wormhole correspond to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "note that birkhoff s theorem could say that cases @xmath11 might be nonvacuum , if the models were interpreted in the framework of the standard einstein equation .",
    "the slightly modified gravitational lensing in modified gravity theories such as a fourth order @xmath12 gravity theory has attracted interests ( e.g. , refs .",
    "it has been shown that the total magnification of the lensed images is stable and always larger than unity against a small spherical perturbation of the schwarzschild lens @xcite .",
    "this suggests that demagnifying gravitational lenses would need a significantly modified structure of the spacetime .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss demagnifying gravitational lenses due to significantly modified spacetimes .",
    "we take the units of @xmath13 throughout this paper .",
    "this paper assumes that an asymptotically flat , static , and spherically symmetric modified spacetime could depend on the inverse distance to the power of positive @xmath0 in the weak - field approximation .",
    "we consider light propagating through a four - dimensional spacetime , though the whole spacetime may be higher - dimensional .",
    "the four - dimensional spacetime metric is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the circumference radius and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are small bookkeeping parameters in the following iterative calculations . here",
    ", @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be either positive or negative , respectively . a negative @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath9 corresponds to a negative mass ( in the linearized schwarzschild metric )",
    ".    for investigating light propagation , it is useful below to make a conformal transformation with a factor of @xmath18 . the null structure ( such as the light propagation ) is not affected by the conformal transformation . at the linear order of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the spacetime metric takes a simpler form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 note that only one parameter @xmath22 enters the conformally transformed metric .    for this metric",
    ", one can find the lagrangian for a massless particle . without loss of generality ,",
    "we focus on the equatorial plane @xmath23 , since the spacetime is spherically symmetric . by using the constants of motion associated with the timelike and rotational killing vectors ,",
    "the deflection angle of light is calculated at the linear order as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the closest approach and the impact parameter of the light ray , respectively .",
    "this deflection angle recovers the schwarzschild ( @xmath9 ) and ellis wormhole ( @xmath10 ) cases .",
    "for particular cases , the above ( always positive ) integral factor becomes @xmath27 henceforth , the deflection angle is denoted simply as @xmath28 by absorbing the numerical constant into the @xmath29 parameter .",
    "under the thin - lens approximation , it is useful to consider the lens equation as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath1 denotes the angular position of the source and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "we wish to consider significant magnification ( or demagnification ) , which could occur for a source in ( or near ) the einstein ring .",
    "the einstein ring is defined for @xmath34 @xcite . if @xmath35 , eq . ( [ lenseq ] ) has no positive roots for @xmath36 because of the repulsive force in the particular gravity model . for @xmath37 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is always a positive root corresponding to the einstein ring .",
    "the negative @xmath22 case is of less astronomical relevance .",
    "therefore , let us consider the positive @xmath22 case ( causing the gravitational pull ) in the following .    in units of the einstein ring radius , eq .",
    "( [ lenseq ] ) is rewritten as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the angular position of the image @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider two lines defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the @xmath44 plane . for @xmath45 , therefore , we have only one intersection of the two lines that corresponds to one image position .",
    "similarly , only one image appears for @xmath46 .    for a general positive @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) ,",
    "it is impossible to find exact solutions for the modified lens equation . to clarify the parameter dependence ,",
    "we employ analytic but approximate methods rather than numerical calculations .",
    "furthermore , in astronomy only the significantly amplified images become detectable in gravitational microlensing .",
    "such events occur only when a source such as a distant star crosses the einstein ring .",
    "we thus focus on such an einstein ring - crossing case as @xmath48 in units of the einstein ring , for which eqs .",
    "( [ lenseqp ] ) and ( [ lenseqm ] ) are solved in the taylor series form with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "we obtain @xmath50",
    "the amplification factor denoted as @xmath51 is @xmath52 , namely , the inverse jacobian of the gravitational lens mapping between the source and image position vectors @xcite . by using eqs .",
    "( [ thetap ] ) and ( [ thetam ] ) , the amplification factor of each image , which is denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , becomes @xmath55 where a difference between @xmath53 and @xmath54 appears at the next order in @xmath49 .",
    "the total amplification is thus @xmath56    for the schwarzschild case ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath57 .",
    "this is always larger than unity for @xmath58 , in concordance with the well - known fact .",
    "demagnification of the total lensed images could occur , however , if @xmath59 the larger the power @xmath0 , the more likely the demagnification .",
    "one might guess that demagnification could be caused for a smaller @xmath49 , especially @xmath60 .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "equation ( [ demag ] ) suggests that the total demagnification could occur only when @xmath49 is small but larger than the critical value @xmath61 under a large-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "note that the compatibility of the assumption @xmath48 and eq .",
    "( [ demag ] ) implies @xmath62 .",
    "namely , eq . ( [ demag ] ) becomes a better approximation as @xmath0 grows larger than unity .",
    "the above argument is based on the near - zone approximation ( @xmath48 ) . for a test of the analytic result",
    ", we perform numerical calculations .",
    "we consider @xmath63 , which might be one of the higher - dimensional models inspired by string theory .",
    "equation ( [ demag ] ) suggests that demagnification of the total lensed images could occur only for @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ figure-1 ] shows numerical results for @xmath65 , and @xmath4 . in the case of @xmath63 , the analytic result for the critical value @xmath66 is in good agreement with the numerical one , @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ figure-2 ] shows numerical light curves for @xmath68 , and @xmath4 . as the power",
    "@xmath0 is larger , time - symmetric demagnification parts in the light curves become longer in time and larger in depth .",
    "cases of @xmath3 and @xmath4 show maximally @xmath5 and @xmath6 percent depletion of the light , when the source position is @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .    before closing this section",
    ", we briefly mention an effective mass .",
    "a simple application of the standard lens theory @xcite suggests that the deflection ( @xmath71 ) and magnification studied here correspond to a convergence ( scaled surface - mass density ) of the form @xmath72 for @xmath73 , therefore , the effective surface - mass density of the lens object is interpreted as negative in the framework of the standard lens theory .",

    "we examined a gravitational lens model inspired by modified gravity theories and exotic matter and energy . by using an asymptotically flat , static , and spherically symmetric spacetime model",
