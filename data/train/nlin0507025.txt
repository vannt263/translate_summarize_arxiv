    "at sufficiently low temperatures , particles in a dilute boson gas can condense in the ground state , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . under the typical confining conditions of experimental settings , becs are inhomogeneous and the number of condensed atoms ( @xmath0 ) ranges from several thousand ( or less ) to several million ( or more ) .",
    "the magnetic traps that confine them are usually approximated by harmonic potentials .",
    "there are two characteristic length scales : the harmonic oscillator length @xmath1 [ which is on the order of a few microns ] , where @xmath2 is the geometric mean of the trapping frequencies , and the mean healing length @xmath3 [ which is on the order of a micron ] , where @xmath4 is the mean particle density and @xmath5 , the ( two - body ) @xmath6-wave scattering length , is determined by the atomic species of the condensate .",
    "interactions between atoms are repulsive when @xmath7 and attractive when @xmath8 . for a dilute ideal gas , @xmath9 .",
    "if considering only two - body , mean - field interactions , a dilute bose - einstein gas can be modeled using a cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with an external potential ; this is also known as the gross - pitaevsky ( gp ) equation .",
    "becs are modeled in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) regime when the transverse dimensions of the condensate are on the order of its healing length and its longitudinal dimension is much larger than its transverse ones @xcite .",
    "the gp equation for the condensate wavefunction @xmath10 takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number density , @xmath13 is the external trapping potential , @xmath14[1 + \\mathcal{o}(\\zeta^2)]$ ] is proportional to the two - body scattering length , and @xmath15 is the dilute gas parameter @xcite .",
    "experimentally realizable potentials @xmath13 include harmonic traps , quartic double - well traps , optical lattices and superlattices , and superpositions of lattices or superlattices with harmonic traps . the existence of quasi-1d ( `` cigar - shaped '' ) becs motivates the study of lower dimensional models such as eq .",
    "( [ nls3 ] ) .",
    "we focus here on the case of spatially periodic potentials without a confining trap along the dimension of the lattice , as that is of particular theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "for example , such potentials have been used to study josephson effects @xcite , squeezed states @xcite , landau - zener tunneling and bloch oscillations @xcite , period - multiplied wavefunctions @xcite , and the transition between superfluidity and mott insulation at both the classical @xcite and quantum @xcite levels . moreover , with each lattice site occupied by one alkali atom in its ground state , a bec in an optical lattice shows promise as a register in a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the properties of becs  including their shape , collective excitations , statistical fluctuations , and the formation and dynamics of their solitons and vortices  are determined by the strength and sign of their two - body atomic interactions @xmath5 .",
    "this scattering length , and hence the coefficient of the nonlinearity in the gp equation , can be adjusted in both sign and magnitude ( over a large range ) by minutely adjusting a magnetic field in the vicinity of a so - called ",
    "feshbach resonance \" @xcite .",
    "a feshbach resonance is an enhancement in the scattering amplitude of a particle incident on a target when the energy of the former is approximately that needed to create a quasibound state of the two - particle system .",
    "if a pair of ultracold atoms has a molecular bound state near zero energy , then during collisions they stick together for a little while as they undergo a feshbach resonance .",
    "while few molecules have bound states at such energies , one can adjust the relative energies of atoms and molecules with different magnetic moments by applying a magnetic field . with such",
    " zeeman tuning \" , one can move the atomic energy from just above the resonance to just below it , so that the scattering length diverges and changes sign from positive to negative across the resonance .    as a result of the control this procedure gives over condensate properties",
    ", the manipulation of ultracold atoms using feshbach resonances has become among the most active research areas in experimental atomic physics .",
    "feshbach resonances have provided a key for creating molecular becs , generating solitons and atom - molecule coherence , stabilizing or destabilizing becs , and creating novel fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "for example , it was recently shown that near a feshbach resonance , a quantum phase transition occurs between a regime with both atomic and molecular condensates and one with only molecular condensates @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this transition should be much easier to observe for condensates loaded into optical lattice potentials .    in feshbach resonance management , which was motivated by similar techniques in fiber optics @xcite , the bec scattering length",
    "is varied periodically in time .",
    "this yields dynamically interesting soliton solutions , such as breathers @xcite .",
    "very recently , there has been some theoretical work concerning feshbach resonances in becs in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "this situation is also the subject of current experimental investigations @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use an averaged gp equation @xcite to examine gap solitons in becs trapped in optical lattices and under the influence of feshbach resonance management . using an envelope - wave approximation , we derive coupled - mode equations describing the slow dynamics of gap solitons . we provide an analytical construction of gap soliton solutions and examine their spectral stability with numerical computations of eigenvalues .",
    "we then describe the time - evolution of gap solitons with the averaged and original gp equations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "we consider the non - dimensional gp equation for trapped becs under feshbach resonance management , @xmath16 where the normalized independent variables are @xmath17 and the tildes have been dropped from eq .",

    "we note that the two small parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) are due to two different physical sources and can be uncorrelated .",
    "one can exert very precise control over optical lattice strengths and wavenumbers experimentally @xcite .",
    "in particular , both strong and weak lattices can be implemented ; we will consider a weak optical lattice , so that @xmath26 in ( [ four ] ) is small . in experiments , the scattering length @xmath5",
    "can also be adjusted either nonadiabatically ( strong nonlinearity management ) , which is the situation discussed in the present work , or adiabatically ( weak nonlinearity management ) . in general",
    ", different dynamics can occur depending on how rapidly @xmath5 is adjusted , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "there have already been some experiments in which feshbach resonances are applied to becs in the presence of optical lattices @xcite and others are being planned by multiple experimental groups . as mentioned above ,",
    "a conservative model is appropriate for strong nonlinearity management . for weak nonlinearity management",
    ", however , the gp equation ( [ gp ] ) needs to be augmented by dissipation terms , as three - body recombination leads to experimental losses @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will only consider strong management , so that @xmath27 in ( [ timedep ] ) is small .",
    "the small parameter @xmath27 can be used to simplify the time - periodic gp equation ( [ gp ] ) with an averaging method . using the time - averaging procedure from @xcite",

    "the model ( [ avg2 ] ) provides a starting point for our analysis of gap solitons in becs in optical lattices under feshbach resonance management . without such management ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "gap solitons of the gp equation ( [ avg2 ] ) were studied in @xcite using floquet theory , multiple - scale expansions , beyond - all - orders theory , and evans - function computations of eigenvalues .",
    "we will mainly consider the opposite case when @xmath34 but @xmath35 .",
    "we are interested in modeling gap solitons supported by subharmonic resonances between the periodic potential and spatio - temporal solutions of the averaged gp equation ( [ avg2 ] ) . to simplify the model",
    ", we use the second small parameter @xmath26 and obtain coupled - mode equations , which averages the spatially periodic nonlinear equation ( [ avg2 ] ) near a spectral gap of its associated linearization , @xmath36 in the limit of small @xmath26 , the spectral gaps all become narrow and the first spectral gap occurs at first order in @xmath26 . using the space - averaging technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can look for an asymptotic solution of the averaged gp equation ( [ avg2 ] ) in the two - wave form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are complex - valued amplitudes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are slow variables , and @xmath42 .",
    "this wavenumber ratio indicates that we are studying @xmath43 subharmonic resonances [ e.g. the first spectral gap of equation ( [ periodic - potential ] ) ] . using the regular asymptotic procedure from @xcite , we obtain a system of coupled - mode equations @xmath44 the first equation governs the left - propagating wave @xmath38 , whereas the second equation governs the right - propagating wave @xmath39 .",
    "the two waves interact with a cubic cross - phase modulation from the mean value of the scattering length and with a quintic cross - phase modulation from the standard deviation of the scattering length .",
    "the latter effect represents the main contribution of feshbach resonance management in trapped becs .",
    "the system of coupled - mode equations ( [ cme ] ) is hamiltonian , with symmetric potential energy @xmath45 additionally , eq .  ( [ w ] ) satisfies the assumption on symmetric potential functions used recently for analyzing the existence and stability of gap solitons @xcite .",
    "while the previous work concerned gap solitons in coupled - mode equations with cubic nonlinearity , we will focus on the new effects that arise from the quintic nonlinear terms .",
    "these effects correspond to mean - zero feshbach resonance management , which affects the propagation of gap solitons in optical lattices .",
    "we can see that the last term of @xmath46 in ( [ w ] ) is positive definite , similar to the second term with @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , feshbach resonance management leads to defocusing effects on the propagation of gap solitons in periodic potentials .",
    "the defocusing role of feshbach resonance management was studied recently in @xcite in the context of blow - up arrest in multi - dimensional gp equations .",
    "one determines the linear spectrum of the coupled - mode equations ( [ cme ] ) from the linearized system in fourier form , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",

    "therefore , the gap soliton solutions bifurcate from the lower spectral band via a local ( small - amplitude ) bifurcation .",
    "they terminate at the upper spectral band via a nonlocal ( large - amplitude ) bifurcation , similar to gap solitons in the gp equation with a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the quintic nls equation ( [ quantic - nls ] ) confirms the predictions of the recent paper @xcite on the power threshold for one - dimensional gap solitons in the case @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of the power threshold near the local bifurcation limit was computed numerically in ref .  @xcite . because the quintic nls equation exhibits a similar power threshold for nls solitons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the numerical fact is now confirmed from the perspective of asymptotic theory .",
    "we note that the coupled - mode equations ( [ cme ] ) with @xmath62 reduce to the cubic nls equation , which does not exhibit the power threshold for nls solitons .",
    "we simplify the construction of exact gap soliton solutions to the coupled - mode equations ( [ cme ] ) by normalizing @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( a standard scaling transformation can be employed for this purpose ) and defining @xmath65 .",

    "<S> we analyze gap solitons in trapped bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattice potentials under feshbach resonance management . starting with an averaged gross - pitaevsky ( gp ) equation with a periodic potential , we employ an envelope wave approximation to derive coupled - mode equations describing the slow bec dynamics in the first spectral gap of the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we construct exact analytical formulas describing gap soliton solutions and examine their spectral stability using the chebyshev interpolation method . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these gap solitons are unstable far from the threshold of local bifurcation and that the instability results in the distortion of their shape . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the threshold of the power of gap solitons near the local bifurcation limit . </S>"
