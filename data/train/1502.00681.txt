    "achieving measurements that approach the ultimate limits to precision is a fundamental , and stimulating , challenge for experimental sciences , and efforts might be rewarded with glimpses of novel effects or solid confirmation of existing paradigms at unprecedented scales .",
    "quantum mechanics dictates the essential limits to measurement , and it is often the case that ultimate precision is achieved by preparing a measurement probe in a state exhibiting genuine quantum features , such as entanglement  @xcite concepts from quantum parameter estimation readily apply to quantum processes .",
    "a familiar example is given by the estimation of a lossy bosonic channel , which could describe , for example , an optical transmission line  @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter , the of the channel , can be estimated uncertainty by using gaussian probe states , such as coherent states , and photon counting  @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of quantum estimation is the characterization of a measurement apparatus itself .",
    "increasingly efficient particle detectors are being leveraged in a wide range of fields , from observational astronomy to quantum information science , and the task of precisely determining the efficiency of these detectors is necessary for their optimal use  @xcite .",
    "inefficient detectors can be modelled as a channel loss followed by a perfect detector ; such a description is commonplace in the analysis of quantum optical experiments  @xcite , and applies to detectors of electromagnetic radiation in general .    when estimating the inefficiency of a detector , the povm is fixed to that implemented by the ideal detector .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the estimation of any other parameter , where one is free to choose the measurement .",
    "this restriction in the choice of the measurement may in general prevent the attainment of the quantum cramr - rao bound  @xcite .",
    "this makes the estimation of the efficiency of a detector conceptually different from other quantum - limited estimation problems .    in this paper , we analyse the use of fock states as resource for the estimation of detector efficiency applied to the two most common optical detection apparatus : on - off counting and homodyne detection .",
    "while both play a vital role in quantum optics experiments , the former has also appeal in astronomical observations .",
    "our main finding is the existence of regions in which fock states provide superior performances to coherent states normally used for calibration .",
    "crucially , this is in the region of very high efficiencies where the forefront of detector development lies .",
    "we also stress the advantages that fock states are able to provide with respect to the case of a lossy channel estimation .",
    "our analysis of the performance of quantum light in estimating detector efficiencies with a higher precision concerns those researchers looking for applications of these detectors in their studies .",
    "these include , for instance , the use of single - photon correlation measurement of celestial bodies in astrometry , and the employ of single - photon detection for precise imaging in biology .",
    "an extensively adopted detection scheme uses on / off ( geiger - mode ) detectors , which are able to tell the presence of photons in the measured field , but can not determine the number of photons .",
    "limitations to the detection efficiency arise from the physical process of light absorption and conversion of the energy into an electrical signal , as well as any loss on the detection setup . here",
    "we address the task of estimating detection efficiency , and show an advantage of quantum optical probe states over classical probes with the same energy .",
    "as we show , this advantage is rapidly lost in the presence of dark counts .",
    "we perform our analysis in terms of the fisher information  @xcite @xmath0 for the efficiency @xmath1 , in which the sum is over each possible detector outcome @xmath2 occuring with probability @xmath3 .",
    "the fisher information bounds the uncertainty , quantified by the variance @xmath4 , attained after @xmath5 repetitions of the experiment through the cramr - rao bound @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "since the detection scheme is fixed by definition in our problem , there is no possibility of invoking the quantum cramr - rao bound , i.e. the cramr - rao optimised over all possible measurements .",
    "prior works have used bayesians estimators for example to saturate this bound in actual experiments , using a modest number of samples  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the noiseless case in which there are no dark count events . for an @xmath7 photon fock state ,",
    "the probabilities of a click ( on ) or a no - click ( off ) event give the following expression for the fisher information @xmath8    it is instructive to analyse the limiting cases of low and high efficiencies . in the former case , the leading term scales as @xmath9 .",
    "the achievable precision thus increases with @xmath7 ; however the scaling is such that the same advantage is obtained by running the experiment @xmath7 times with single photons .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fock ] in which we plot the fisher information for @xmath10 and @xmath11 at fixed probe energy , i.e. , we compare @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the low efficiency region ,",
    "the two curves match . outside of this region",
    ", a wiser use of the energy is preparing @xmath7 times as many single photons , rather than concentrating it on a single @xmath7 photon state ; in the appendix , we demonstrate the optimality of this strategy .    in the opposite limit of a highly efficient detector , @xmath14 , the leading term is @xmath15 the quadratic increase is compensated by the exponential term , except in the cases @xmath10 , and @xmath16 .",
    "for single photons , a divergence is obtained for @xmath14 , which makes them more suitable probe states .",
    "we notice that this is in contrast with known results for loss estimation , for which a scaling @xmath17 can be achieved with @xmath7-photon states  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the detector fixes the measurement prevents one from choosing the povm for the estimation of the loss parameter as the optimal given by the symmetric logarithmic derivative .",
    "the advantages of quantum light can be assessed by inspecting the performance of coherent states ; a suitable comparison can be made by considering probe states with the same average energy.the fisher information for a coherent state @xmath18 is @xmath19 the comparison is carried out in fig.[fig : fock ] for both three uses of a coherent state with @xmath20 and a single use of @xmath21 . in the low efficiency limit ,",
    "the scaling with the energy is the same as with fock states , making the performance of a coherent state closely match the one of a single photon .",
    "although to a lesser extent than with fock states , the advantage of multiple , less energetic probes appears with coherent states as well .",
    "most practical detectors are affected by dark counts , and we take that into account in the following .",
    "a dark count corresponds to an event in which the detector response indicates the presence of photons , despite an input state of vacuum .",
    "the probability of a dark count can typically be measured with very low uncertainty , so we assume this error to be negligible and proceed with a single - parameter estimation of @xmath1 .",
    "this process is modelled as a thermal state reducing the probability of no counts in presence of vacuum by @xmath22  @xcite , which modifies the expression for the fisher information as @xmath23 optimality of different states at low efficiency @xmath24 can be assessed by considering a truncated expansion : @xmath25 interesting features become evident in this limit .",
    "fock states with @xmath7 photons , and @xmath7 repetitions of single photons are not equivalent : the @xmath7-photon state suppresses the additional cost term @xmath26 by a factor @xmath7 , hence large fock state perform fundamentally better .",
    "however , coherent states present a very similar behaviour , with a slight difference coming from the fact that @xmath1 is modified by a factor @xmath27 , which , in many relevant cases can be close to unity . a numerical comparison of these approximate expressions is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : noise ] , for the case @xmath28 : the advantage of the @xmath29 state over five replicas of a single photon is evident , while the relative advantage with respect a coherent state is much less pronounced .    the methods employed above can also be applied to the case of @xmath30-outcome detectors , which can resolve @xmath31 photons , but can not distinguish @xmath30 from @xmath32 photons .",
    "this is a limitation typically encountered in photon - number resolving detectors , such as transition - edge sensors .",
    "we also consider the simple case in which the efficiency is independent on the incoming photon number , i.e. the probability of an outcome @xmath33 given the input @xmath34 is simply @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . from the expression of the fisher information reported in the appendix , we found that the fock state with @xmath37 delivers the largest information for all values of @xmath1 : @xmath38 .",
    "the behaviour is then analogous to that of the on / off detector .",
    "a more refined treatment requires to consider a general expression in which the probabilities @xmath39 are generated by a stochastic matrix taking into account the fact that the efficiency might depend on the particular outcome .",
    "we now address the case of the homodyne detector , an example of gaussian measurement . here",
    "we consider the fisher information associated with the probability of detecting a quadrature amplitude @xmath40 .",
    "as above , we compare the use of fock states and coherent states . in the latter case ,",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the coherent state is in phase with the local oscillator of the homodyne detector . when accounting for the detection efficiencies the distributions become : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43-th hermite polynomial , and we set the standard quantum noise to 1/2 .    for the coherent state",
    "we obtain an expression for the fisher information : @xmath44  @xcite . for the case of fock states",
    "it has not been possible to obtain closed forms for the integrals on @xmath2 leading to the fisher information ; therefore , we have performed these integrals numerically for a set of chosen values of @xmath1 , and then interpolated .",
    "the comparison is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : hd ] , where we show the behaviour at a fixed energy with @xmath45 photons distributed in either @xmath10 , @xmath16 or @xmath46 fock states , in addition with a coherent state with @xmath47 .",
    "we then compare two different strategies . when using coherent states , we aim at distinguishing a displacement of the gaussian quadrature distribution , with respect to the vacuum ; on the other hand , we rely on non - gaussian features of the distributions when using fock states  @xcite .    for high efficiencies @xmath48 , fock states perform better than coherent states .",
    "intuitively , in this limit , the rapidly - varying features originating from the fock states enable a measurement that is more sensitive to inefficiency than the smooth gaussian distribution resulting from coherent states . in the limit of very high efficiency , the more baroque the quadrature distribution , the more precise the measurement .",
    "such features , though , are rapidly smoothed out as the efficiency decreases .    in the opposite limit of low efficiencies ,",
    "higher - number states become more than a single - photon state , due to the presence of more non - gaussian features in the distributions ; however , the best option appears to be the estimation of the displacement due to the coherent state .",
    "our analysis also applies in the presence of electronic noise , which can be encompassed in an effective efficiency  @xcite .",
    "single photons are often produced by spontaneous parametric down conversion  @xcite .",
    "the photon pair production mechanism is employed in such a way that one particle acts as a herald for a second photon emitted on a correlated mode .",
    "although the generation occurs in pairs to satisfy energy conservation , imperfect mode matching makes it possible to herald photons with a limited efficiency @xmath49 , which then represents the average photon number on the mode .",
    "such limited heralding efficiency can be responsible for a loss of advantage in the calibration of detector efficiency ; while the use of such a scheme has been known to be useful for for absolute calibration  @xcite , here we analyse its performance in terms of use of resources .",
    "our main findings are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : heralding ] for the case of an on - off detector .",
    "one can tolerate limited heralding efficiency while still preserving an advantage with respect to the use of coherent states with an average photon number of one  the comparison is thus not carried out at fixed energy , to understand whether it is profitable to generate quantum resources .",
    "remarkably , for high efficiencies the fact that the photon statistics is not poissonian allows to tolerate heralding efficiencies as low as 0.36 to retain an advantage over coherent states ; values of approximately 0.8 have recently been reported  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behaviour for the case of homodyne detection has been found to be similar , albeit the requirements on the heralding efficiencies are more demanding : the minimal value for appreciating an advantage over a coherent state with @xmath50 has been found to be @xmath51 .    as to the practical implementation , we observe that , for an accurate estimation , the value of @xmath49 needs to be calibrated beforehand , while the efficiency of the detector does not enter the calculations , since it only sets the generation rate .",
    "also , the presence of high - order terms in the emission might affect the precision , however , one can limit their presence by a continuous - wave pump  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the estimation of the efficiency of photonic detectors using fock states , and the benchmarking of their performance against coherent states of the same average photon number .",
    "we have found that single photons are close to the optimal performance for both an on - off detector and a homodyne detector for high efficiencies ; in the regime of low efficiencies , however , their advantage is modest , if not inferior to that of coherent states .",
    "the choice of such probe states is dictated by the feasibility of their sources .",
    "future directions will also include a full characterisation of photon - resolving detectors , which require a multi - parameter approach , as the whole matrix linking the input photon number and the output click number must be taken into account .",
