    "astrophysical observations of type ia supernovae [ 1 , 2 ] , the large - scale structure [ 3 ] , the cosmic microwave back grand radiation [ 4 ] suggest accelerated expansion of universe which may be described by the dark energy [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "the simplest model to describe dark energy is the cosmological constant , but this model suffers from the cosmic coincidence problems and the fine - tuning .",
    "another suggested models consist of k - essence [ 7 , 8 ] , tachyon [ 9 ] , quintom [ 10 ] , quintessence [ 11 ] and phantom [ 12 ] .",
    "also , there is an interesting model based on equation of state of chaplygin gas and its generalizations [ 13 - 20 ] . on the other hand",
    ", one can investigate the nature of dark energy based on some principles of quantum gravity , which is yield to holographic dark energy ( hde ) model [ 21 - 29 ] .",
    "+ in the recent work [ 30 ] , interacting hde based on scalar field models has been studied and found that interacting hde model can be considered as the modified chaplygin gas model . in that case",
    "it is possible to study interacting entropy - corrected holographic dark energy models [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] .",
    "so , in the refs . [ 31 , 32 ] a correspondence between the tachyon , k - essence and dilaton scalar field models established with the interacting entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model in non - flat frw universe , and dynamics of these scalar fields according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model has been studied",
    ". then ref .",
    "[ 33 ] extended previous works to the case of variable gravitational constant and obtained the equation of state and the deceleration parameters of the interacting viscous entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model .",
    "also , the potential and the dynamics of the quintessence , tachyon , k - essence and dilaton scalar field models according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting viscous entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model with time - varying @xmath0 reconstructed .",
    "+ now , in this paper we would like to obtain relation between interacting entropy - corrected hde model and modified chaplygin gas , also with scalar fields by using different choices of ir cut - off length .",
    "it is found that the hde density may be obtained from the entropy bound [ 34 ] . in the framework of black hole thermodynamics [ 35 - 46 ]",
    ", there is a maximum entropy which is called the bekenstein - hawking entropy bound ( @xmath1 ) , which is yield to the following relation for the hde density [ 33 ] , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a numerical constant ( however it may be considered as a non - constant parameter [ 47 , 48 ] ) , @xmath4 is the reduce planck mass , and @xmath5 shows the ir cut - off length . in the restriction ( 1 ) , equality is given if the holographic bound is saturated . in order to consider the quantum effects the bekenstein - hawking entropy may be corrected as the following [ 49 , 50 , 51 ] , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are undetermined constants . by using the relation ( 2 ) the entropy - corrected hde proposed in the following form [ 52 ] , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dimensionless constants .",
    "in this paper we use several choice of ir cut - off length such as @xmath12 ( the hubble radius ) , @xmath13 ( the radius of the event horizon ) , @xmath14 ( the ricci length ) , and @xmath15 ( the granda - oliveros length ) .",
    "as we know the frw universe is described by the following line element , @xmath16 where @xmath17 are corresponding to flat , closed and open universe . the first friedman equation is given by , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy density for the entropy corrected single hde model and @xmath20 is the energy density of dark matter .",
    "also the conservation energy equation separated as the following , @xmath21 and @xmath22 where equation of state @xmath23 is used . also , @xmath24 is the interacting term of the form , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless positive parameter .",
    "therefore we can rewrite equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) as the following , @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 . adding both equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) gives , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 where the fractional energy densities are defined as , @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 which yield to the following relation , @xmath36 in the following we use unitary transformation @xmath37 .",
    "+ now we investigate relation between entropy corrected hde model and modified chaplygin gas with the following equation of state , @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "we would like to examine the equation ( 3 ) for the following cases .",
    "in that case we use , @xmath42 in the equation ( 3 ) which gives , @xmath43 using the equations ( 5 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 19 ) give the following equation of state parameter , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "so , one can obtain , @xmath46 on the other hand , the mcg model has the following equation of state parameter , @xmath47 where we used the equation ( 17 ) and @xmath48 . by using modified chaplygin gas equation of state in the energy conservation relation one can obtain scale factor - dependent energy density as the following , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the integration constant . substituting ( 23 ) in ( 22 ) and assuming @xmath52 give , @xmath53 therefore we obtain , @xmath54 thus , the entropy - corrected hde model for hubble radius as ir cut - off can be considered as modified chaplygin gas model .      in that case",
    "we use , @xmath55 in the equation ( 3 ) . for the event horizon ,",
    "the radius is chosen in the form of @xmath56 where the function @xmath57 obtained from the following relation , @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "therefore we can obtain , @xmath60 where @xmath61 now from the equation ( 12 ) we have , @xmath62 which may be rewritten as the following equation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "hence , we obtain , @xmath68{-108\\,\\xi\\,{\\theta}^{2}+8\\,{\\tau}^{3}+12\\ , \\sqrt { -3\\,\\xi\\ , \\left ( -27\\,\\xi\\,{\\theta}^{2}+4\\,{\\tau}^{3 } \\right ) } \\theta}}{6\\theta}}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { \\frac { 2{\\tau}^{2}}{3\\theta\\,\\sqrt [ 3]{-108\\,\\xi \\,{\\theta}^{2}+8\\,{\\tau}^{3}+12\\,\\sqrt { -3\\,\\xi\\ , \\left ( -27\\,\\xi\\ , { \\theta}^{2}+4\\,{\\tau}^{3 } \\right ) } \\theta}}}+{\\frac { \\tau}{3\\theta } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the fig .",
    "1 we can see that the parameter @xmath10 increased the @xmath69 while the parameter @xmath11 decreased one .     with @xmath10 ( solid line ) and @xmath11 ( dashed line ) . ]      in that case we use , @xmath70 in the equation ( 3 ) , and after some calculations obtain , @xmath71 where , @xmath72 .",
    "we find that @xmath73 is always positive ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which is agree with the ref . [ 30 ]     in terms of scale factor . ]",
    "in that case we use [ 53 , 54 ] , @xmath74 in the equation ( 3 ) , and after some calculations and compare with modified chaplygin gas obtain , @xmath75",
    "in this section we consider three models of scalar field and investigate relation with entropy corrected hde model .",
    "the general form of the action for k - essence scalar field written as the following , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is pressure density and @xmath78 .",
    "the energy density and pressure represented as the following , @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the k - essence potential , and in comparison with entropy corrected hde model we obtain , @xmath82      in that case by using the relation ( 26 ) we can obtain , @xmath83 which yields to the following expression , @xmath84 in order to have a real k - essence scalar field we should have the following restriction , @xmath85      now , by using the relation ( 33 ) we obtain , @xmath86+(u+2)}{\\frac{2}{\\omega_d}[\\frac{\\omega_d}{\\eta}-2]+(3u+4)}.\\ ] ] therefore , we obtain , , @xmath87 ^ 2}{2(2+\\frac{2}{3\\omega_d}(\\frac{\\omega_d}{\\eta}-2)+u)}.\\ ] ] in order to have a real k - essence scalar field we should have the following restriction , @xmath88 from the equation , @xmath89 we can write the explicit form of the k - essence scalar field as , @xmath90      the effective lagrangian for the tachyon field is described by , @xmath91 the energy density and pressure for the tachyon field are given by the following expressions , @xmath92 and , @xmath93 in order to find relation between tachyon field and entropy corrected hde model we consider cases of event horizon radius and ricci length scale as ir cut - off .      in that case by using the relation ( 26 ) we can obtain , @xmath94}}d\\omega_d+\\phi_{0},\\ ] ] and , @xmath95      now , by using the relation ( 33 ) we obtain , @xmath96 and , @xmath97 relation ( 55 ) tells that the correction parameters which involves in @xmath98 decreased potential @xmath99 .",
    "the energy density and pressure for the quintessence are given by , @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a quintessence field with potential @xmath99 .",
    "here , we assumed @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , one can be obtain , @xmath105 and , @xmath106 where , @xmath107\\ ] ]      in this case one obtain , @xmath108}}dx+\\phi_0\\ ] ] where @xmath109 defined as before , and , @xmath110 thus , @xmath102 and @xmath99 are obtain as a function of the density parameter @xmath73 .      by using the relation ( 33 )",
    "we obtain , @xmath111[\\frac{7ba^\\mu+\\delta(3a+4)}{(ba^\\mu+\\delta)(2\\eta+3(u+1))}]}\\frac{da}{a}+\\phi_{0},\\ ] ] and , @xmath112 it is clear that the entropy correction parameters decreased value of potential .",
    "in this paper , entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model considered for various ir cut - off such as hubble radius , event horizon radius , ricci length scale , and granda - oliveros length scale .",
    "indeed we extended the ref . [",
    "30 ] to the case of entropy corrected with parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we investigated relation of entropy - corrected holographic dark energy model with modified chaplygin gas and scalar field models .",
    "we found that correction parameters may be increased or decreased dark energy density .",
    "indeed , we found that the first correction term ( second terms of right hand side of the equation ( 3 ) ) increased dark energy density , while the second correction includes parameter @xmath11 decreased dark energy density",
    ". therefore appropriate choices of @xmath10 and @xmath11 may be canceled each other . also we found that the correction parameters reduced potential of scalar fields .",
    "+ here , there are some interesting problems such as adding shear and bulk viscosity to system and repeat discussion of this paper . also one can use explicit expression of scale factor in terms of time and discuss time - dependent solutions .",
