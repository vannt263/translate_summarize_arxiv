    "the current census of nearby white dwarfs is complete to within 20 parsecs from the sun , and contains 126 white dwarfs @xcite . since it represents a sample too small for detailed statistical analysis ,",
    "there is a need to extend the complete sample of white dwarfs to a larger volume .",
    "nearby white dwarfs have been traditionally found in catalogs of stars with large proper motions . in order to improve the statistics of the local white dwarf population",
    ", we have been hunting for white dwarfs in the superblink catalog .",
    "+ the superblink proper motion database @xcite is based on a re - analysis of the poss - i and poss - ii plates of the digitized sky survey ( 20 - 45 yr baseline ) .",
    "its 1.3 million stars in the northern sky were identified with a detection level > @xmath2 down to @xmath3 , and a proper motion limit as low as 0.04@xmath4 . because of its low proper motion limit",
    ", the superblink sample effectively eliminates the kinematic bias of the luyten catalogs , while detecting all white dwarfs down to the luminosity function turn - off .",
    "the first step of our analysis was to gather information about suberblink stars , as a complement to photographic @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 measurements , j2000 coordinates , and proper motions available for each superblink star ( see @xcite ) .",
    "catalogs were queried in order to obtain galex far - uv ( @xmath8 ) and near - uv ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , sdss @xmath10 @xcite or 2mass @xmath11 @xcite photometry .",
    "apparent @xmath12 magnitudes are estimated using the empirical relation @xmath13 .",
    "stars are then placed in @xmath14 vs @xmath15 , @xmath16 vs @xmath17 or @xmath16 vs @xmath18 reduced proper motion diagrams , depending on the available photometry for each object . when possible , cross - correlations between the diagrams are performed .",
    "selection criteria are applied based on each star s position in the diagram ( more details will be given in limoges et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) . finally , confirmed white dwarfs from @xcite are used to obtain color - magnitude calibrations , from which we determine an absolute magnitude and photometric distance for each candidate .",
    "candidates with distance estimates less than 50 parsecs were selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "+    .spectral types of our new white dwarfs sample [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     all spectra have been obtained at kitt peak with the steward observatory 2.3-m telescope , and the noao mayall 4-m and 2.1-m telescopes .",
    "the adopted configurations allow a spectral coverage of @xmath1932005300 and @xmath1938006700 , at a mean resolution of @xmath20    fwhm .",
    "a subset of da and dc stars from our sample of new white dwarfs is shown in figure 1 . in figure 2",
    ", a color - color diagram displays the confirmed white dwarfs and candidates for which @xmath10 data were available .",
    "a summary of the spectral types for the 137 new white dwarfs is shown in table 1 .",
    "finally , a sample of the detailed list of our new white dwarfs , including astrometry and spectral type is given in table 2.limoges/ ]",
    "from our list of candidates , 137 white dwarfs were found .",
    "most of these objets were already part of the literature , without spectral type or white dwarf status confirmation .",
    "the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of 114 stars were measured .",
    "da stars were analyzed using the spectroscopic fitting technique described at length in @xcite and references therein .",
    "detailed photometric analyses of their energy distributions @xcite were performed for cooler objects showing only the @xmath23 hydrogen line and featureless dc stars .",
    "our results are summarized in figure [ correltm ] in a mass vs @xmath24 diagram .",
    "distances were then derived from the atmospheric parameters .",
    "it was found that 82 stars are closer than 50 parsecs , and 57 are within 40 parsecs .",
    "the remaining 23 cool stars will be analyzed as soon as we acquire the photometric measurements .",
    "figures 2 and [ correltm ] demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting cool white dwarfs .",
    "we are now reaching the bottom of the luminosity distribution , and on our way to obtaining a statistically complete sample of nearby white dwarfs .",
    "we would like to thank the director and staff of steward observatory for the use of their facilities .",
