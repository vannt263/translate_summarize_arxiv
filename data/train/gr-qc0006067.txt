    "one of the most important physical results of loop quantum gravity @xcite is the prediction that the spectra of geometric operators , corresponding to their classical analogues such as areas of surfaces and volumes of regions , are purely discrete @xcite .",
    "some other intriguing features of this ` non - perturbative quantum geometry ' have emerged already at the kinematical level , for example , the non - commutativity of geometric operators @xcite , and the statistical derivation of black hole entropy @xcite . despite the relative success of the canonical / loop quantum gravity approach ,",
    "two major problems need to be successfully tackled : dynamics ( that is , a complete and anomaly - free implementation of the quantum hamiltonian constraint ) and the recovery of general relativity as a low energy / macroscopic regime of the quantum theory .",
    "how could the two problems be related is an open question , but it is likely that a complete understanding of the quasi - classical regime of the theory at the kinematical level ( in particular states which can approximate functions of connections ) can give some insight into the dynamics of the theory @xcite .    in this approach , general relativity ( gr ) has to arise from the semi - classical limit of the quantum theory through properly defined ` coherent states ' and a suitable coarse - graining .",
    "coherent states have been constructed only recently in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , we shall argue that some important issues have to be addressed first in order to obtain a complete understanding of the problem . at the kinematical level ,",
    "the first attempts in this direction were given by the so called ` weave states ' in the old loop representation @xcite . as originally constructed , weave states were intended to be semi - classical states ( initially , eigenstates of geometrical operators ) that approximate smooth geometries on a background spatial ( and compact ) 3-manifold @xmath0 for large scales .",
    "that is , given a fiducial metric on @xmath0 , the spatial average of expectation values of area and volume operators in this state should be given by their classical values as measured by the fiducial 3-metric on @xmath0 above some macroscopic scale @xmath1 .",
    "there is increasing hope that once one has a good candidate for a weave describing flat space , one would be able to develop quantum field theory ( qft ) on these states .",
    "there are some evidences pointing out in the direction that qft s on weaves would be free of infinities and should not require any renormalization procedure @xcite .    another important issue that deserves further attention is whether semi - classical states can be promoted to solutions to the hamiltonian constraint of the theory .",
    "it is well known that eigenstates of 3-geometries are not suitable states describing 4-dimensional minkowski space - time , as happens , for instance , in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) where an eigenstate of the electric field operator with null eigenvalue has a very different physical meaning than that of qed vacuum @xcite",
    ". however , kinematical results could be important by themselves in situations where classical boundary conditions such as asymptotical flat space times @xcite and isolated black holes boundary conditions are imposed on the system @xcite .",
    "recent attempts in constructing weaves were given in @xcite with the use of ` spin networks ' , and have been recently used as a background ` thermal ' state to construct new hilbert spaces for non - compact spaces @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , weaves are defined based on the behavior of geometrical operators that depend only in momentum variables and therefore , only provide information about half of the classical phase space while the behavior of some connection variable operators might not be under control in these states .",
    "in fact , the original weaves were expected to be ` concentrated ' in geometry , so they are highly delocalized in the connection variable and the fluctuations of the configuration operators might be very large .",
    "for instance , it has been recently shown that the natural strategy for approximating connections by taking the elementary configuration variable , namely the @xmath2 holonomy , as the multiplicative operator , fails @xcite . any attempt to reproduce their classical analogue",
    "is doomed since there are no quantum states that support such supposition and such that they satisfy additional minimum uncertainty relations @xcite . instead",
    ", a more ambitious proposal has been given by the authors of @xcite and consists on a tentative definition of ` quasi - classicity ' , a latticization of the underlying manifold and the use of ` magnetic flux ' type operators .",
    "this was the first step in attempting to construct within the loop approach , realistic semi - classical states at the kinematical level ( in the simplified case of two spatial dimensions ) .",
    "more recently , a series of papers by thiemann and winkler have appeared in which semi - classical states are constructed from a ( complex ) coherent - state transform on phase space ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this work",
    "we follow the same strategy as in @xcite , namely we construct an ( invertible ) weave state based on a cylindrical function , that might serve as background for the construction of new hilbert spaces when the space is non - compact .",
    "there is however , an important difference between our weave state and the one originally proposed in @xcite : our state depends in a ` gaussian way ' , i.e. on a suitable exponential arrangement of square of group elements .",
    "the state constructed here is peaked around the trivial ` flat ' connection that yields the identity element for the holonomy around each loop defining the state . with this prescription",
    ", one might hope to overcome the objection previously raised regarding large fluctuations for ( every ) holonomy operator . in this sense , if one is able to reproduce the flat ( metric ) behavior through the geometric operators , and the connection is also ` peaked ' around the flat connection , one might hope to have a semi - classical state approximating minkowski space - time .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the exponential dependence on group elements is a common feature of coherent states in compact lie groups @xcite .",
    "we will show that this one - parameter family of states has better behavior than the original ` quasi - coherent ' weave , and that in this case , the states are peaked and centered around the fundamental representation , when written in the spin network basis .",
    "this result is particularly intriguing , since a similar behavior , i.e. , a dominance of the fundamental representation , is also observed in the computation of the black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we give a very brief review of the most important facts of loop quantum gravity that are relevant for this work .",
    "readers familiar with the loop formalism may want to skip to section [ sec3 ] where the notion of a weave state is recalled . in the section [ 3.2 ]",
    "we proceed to the construction of the ` gaussian ' weave which approximates flat space .",
    "we also take the opportunity to make some general observations and , in particular , we discuss some subtleties that arise when an eigenbasis of the area operator is introduced .",
    "we close with a discussion in section [ dis ] .",
    "canonical / loop quantum gravity is a canonical approach for quantizing general relativity in a non - perturbative way . in this approach ,",
    "general relativity is a purely constrained system , a feature for all diffeomorphism invariant theories .",
    "a rigorous kinematical framework to handle theories whose classical configuration space is given by connections _",
    "local gauge transformations , has been constructed in the past decade @xcite .",
    "general relativity can be written in this form using the so - called ashtekar - barbero variables @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize the main results of this approach .",
    "the classical phase space consists of canonical pairs of a @xmath2 valued connection @xmath3 on an orientable spatial 3-manifold @xmath0 and its conjugate momentum variable , a densitized triad @xmath4 which takes values in the dual of the lie algebra @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the theory , for compact @xmath0 , is pure _ gauge _ and is encoded in the gauss constraint which generates @xmath2 gauge transformations , the spatial 3-dimensional diffeomorphism constraint generating spatial 3d diffeomorphisms on @xmath0 , and the hamiltonian constraint which generates the coordinate time evolution .",
    "the classical configuration space @xmath5 , is given by the space of all smooth connections on a principal @xmath2 bundle over @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath5 is infinite dimensional the quantum configuration space @xmath6 is a certain completion of the classical one which includes all ` distribution - like ' connection , in a similar role played in free field theory in minkowskian space by the tempered distributions .",
    "hence @xmath6 is taken to be the space of generalized connections which have a well defined action on oriented paths over @xmath0 and the group of generalized @xmath2 gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 is compact it admits a regular diffeomorphism - invariant measure @xmath7 and the hilbert space can be taken to be the space @xmath8 of square - integrable functions on @xmath6 .",
    "this space is actually non - separable , but we can associate quantum states of the gauge theory to finite graphs @xmath9 . if we consider all possible graphs , we obtain a very large set of states which are _ dense _ on @xmath10 .",
    "these states defined on finite graphs are called _ cylindrical functions _ and depend on finite sets of holonomies along the edges of the graph .",
    "therefore , given any complex valued function @xmath11 we can associate a cylindrical function @xmath12 as follows : _ , ( a)=(h_e_1(a), .. ,h_e_n(a ) ) .",

    "h(h_e_n ) where @xmath17 is the n - copy haar measure naturally induced from @xmath2 . if the graphs @xmath18 and @xmath19 are different , the respective cylindrical functions can be viewed as being defined in the same graph , which is the union of both : @xmath20 .",
    "the classical algebra of elementary observables @xmath21 consist of the set of canonical variables @xmath3 and @xmath22 smeared against suitable fields which in this case are one dimensional for the connection , and two - dimensional for the triad field @xcite .",
    "the space of configuration variables is given by the space cyl of functions of the type ( [ cf ] ) , when the graph @xmath9 is varied over all arbitrary finite graph .",
    "the momentum variables are obtained by smearing the pseudo 2-forms @xmath23 against a test field @xmath24 which takes values in the lie - algebra of @xmath2 .",

    "the surface @xmath25 is restricted to be of the type @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is any compact , analytic 2-dimensional sub - manifold of @xmath0 possibly with boundary .",
    "see @xcite for details and @xcite for an alternative choice of variables . the standard representation of the quantum algebra on @xmath28 is to have the cylindrical ( configuration ) functions act as multiplicative operators , and `` electric flux '' variables as certain derivative operators @xcite .",
    "when the spatial slice @xmath0 is non - compact , a quantum state that describes , say , an asymptotically - flat space requires an infinite volume ( and a contribution to this volume coming from everywhere within @xmath0 ) .",
    "this in turn , implies that the state must have contributions from graphs with an infinite number of edges .",
    "this state would not , in particular , belong to our hilbert space @xmath28 . in order to have a formalism that would allow for these situations , arnsdorf and gupta",
    "have proposed an algebraic construction , a la gns , to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the basic idea is to construct new hilbert spaces where a particular , semi - classical , non - normalizable state would serve as a vacuum of the theory , and the ordinary normalizable states would be seen as ` finite excitations ' of the geometry . for details of the construction",
    "see @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", it is enough to know that the formalism requires an invertible state , that is , a state that does not vanish for any point on @xmath6 , and that has support on an infinite number of edges . in the next section",
    "we shall construct such an state .",
    "this section has two parts . in the first one we recall the general definition of a weave state . in the second part",
    ", we construct a gaussian weave and show that it satisfies the requirements for a decent weave state and that it has some interesting features that make it an acceptable candidate for a quantum theory on non - compact spaces .      in any quantum field theory ,",
    "the semi - classical regime is obtained or represented by two main ingredients : `` coherent states '' and a suitable coarse graining . however , in the case of the gravitational field additional problems arise since the notion of `` vacuum state '' is not provided a priori , unless one forces it by splitting the metric into a preferred vacuum metric ( usually taken flat ) and a perturbative term whose fluctuations define the quantum theory . in the other hand , in canonical / loop quantum gravity , as in any other non - perturbative approach to quantum gravity , the natural ` vacuum state ' corresponds to the ` no metric ' space @xmath29 . in this case",
    "flat space becomes a highly excited state of the 3-geometry , containing an infinite number of fundamental excitations .",
    "weave states are kinematic states constructed to provide semi - classical metric information over the spatial 3-manifold @xmath0 , that is , they approximate flat space above some macroscopic scale @xmath30 . however , since the spatial metric @xmath31 is constructed completely from momentum variables ( densitized triads ) , weaves are normally thought to be highly concentrated in geometry , and it is possible that certain configuration variables , when promoted to operators , would be wildly delocalized in these states",
    ". this would render the weave states as unsuitable candidates for quasi - classical states .",
    "however , the weave state that we shall construct here is peaked , in the connection representation , around the flat connection for each loop of the defining graph .",
    "thus , one expects that certain configuration observables be localized on these states .",
    "it is important to recall that all relevant results in the semi - classical regime of the theory have emerged at the kinematical level since a complete and anomaly - free implementation of the constraints have not been found successfully .",
    "the discrete nature of quantum geometry @xcite provides a suitable criterion for approximating flat space .",
    "there are geometric operators which are self - adjoint in the hilbert space @xmath10 and that measure areas of surfaces and volumes of regions .",
    "therefore , a classical spatial metric can be approximated by requiring that the expectation values of areas and volumes of macroscopic surfaces and regions correspond to their classical analogues .",
    "let suppose that we want to approximate the euclidean 3-space @xmath32 with the weave state @xmath33 .",
    "the strategy is as follows : let consider a macroscopic region in @xmath32 ( of size larger than @xmath1 ) with bulk @xmath34 and surface @xmath25 .",
    "we perform successive measurements of the volume of the region @xmath35 and the area of the surface @xmath36 on the state @xmath33 at different positions in @xmath0 .",
    "the state @xmath33 is called a ` weave ' state if it satisfies the following requirements :    1 .",
    "the spatial average of the expectation values of the area @xmath25 and volume @xmath34 agree with their classical values .",
    "+ [ expvalues ] _ w= _ s + o(^2/^2 ) , _ w= _",
    "r + o(^3/^3 ) , + where @xmath1 is the characteristic macroscopic size of the bulk and @xmath37 is a microscopic scale , which is normally taken to be of the order of the planck length @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the induced metric on @xmath25 , the `` over - line '' indicates spatial average and the expectation values are taken in the state @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   the state @xmath33 must have small quantum fluctuations in the measurements with regard to the macroscopic scale @xmath1 .",
    "+ [ deviations ] _ v ^3 + _ a ^2 + where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the standard deviations of the repeated measurements of the volume and area of the corresponding region .",
    "actually , the conditions ( [ deviations ] ) can be satisfied by an infinitely number of quantum states and do not single out a preferred state . in general",
    ", one could identify two distinct steps in the construction of a candidate of a weave state .",
    "first , one specifies a graph on @xmath0 where the state is supposed to have support ( or a family of graphs in a statistical sum ) .",
    "for instance , one could provide a lattice that ` covers ' the whole space @xmath0 @xcite , or a ` unit ' graph @xmath42 that is going to be spread over @xmath0 to cover it .",
    "the second step involves the specification of a cylindrical function to be living on the basic units of the construction , be it on plaquetes of the lattice in the first case above , or basic cylindric functions on the graph @xmath42 .",
    "some explicit examples of both types have been constructed in the literature , the first ones being simultaneous eigenstates of the volume and area operators ( @xcite,@xcite ) and a recent ` quasi - coherent ' state @xcite with some nice properties .",
    "an example of states based on a lattice is given in @xcite .",
    "in this note , we construct a particular weave state similar in spirit to the one given in @xcite .",
    "actually , one is only proposing a cylinder function ( i.e. , the second step in the construction outlined above ) , which could in principle be implemented on different graphs .",
    "we choose a graph construction first proposed in @xcite ( and also considered in @xcite ) for simplicity , and to be able to compare the properties of our gaussian ansatz with the other proposals .",
    "it should be clear from the discussion that one could take our gaussian ansatz and implement it in other graph / lattice constructions .",
    "our ansatz has the property that it shares some of the nice properties of earlier proposals , that is : it is an invertible state , is peaked in the connection and the spin - network basis .",
    "however , it has the particular feature that the peak in the spin - network basis is centered around the fundamental representation",
    ". we shall refer to this state as the ` gaussian ' weave because it is constructed as a gaussian function of cylindrical factors .",
    "the aim of a weave is to reproduce the area and volume of _ any _ region in the slice @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the graph in which the state is based must fill all @xmath0 and if the space @xmath0 is non - compact , one is left with two options : the graph either consists of edges of infinite length or it is an infinite set of finite graphs . in particular , our weave state is based on a disjoint union of an infinite collection of finite graphs : @xmath43 where @xmath44 represent the graph of a system of two non - coplanar circles @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the same radius @xmath47 respect to a fiducial metric , which intersect in a single vertex , see fig .",
    "[ lens ] . these systems of circles are randomly distributed in @xmath0 with average density @xmath48 measured with the same fiducial metric .",
    "let us define the cylindrical function based in the graph @xmath44 g_i(a)=n , [ fg ] where @xmath49 is a normalization factor , @xmath50 is a positive parameter , @xmath51 are the holonomies along the circles @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively and the subindex @xmath54 represents the fundamental representation in @xmath2 ( color 1 in the terminology of penrose ) .",
    "it is worth noting the gaussian dependence on group elements .",
    "the gaussian weave can be written as an infinite product of functions ( [ fg ] ) .",
    "n _ i=1^n g_i(a ) .",
    "[ we ] this state does not belong to the hilbert space @xmath10 but is defined through the cylindrical function @xmath55 based on the graph @xmath44 and can be considered as a candidate for a background ( thermal ) state for constructing new hilbert spaces as in @xcite .",
    "the state ( [ we ] ) has common features with that given in @xcite and can be considered as a ` quasi - coherent ' state in the same footing . by definition ,",
    "the cylindrical functions given by the finite product @xmath56 take on their maximum values when the holonomies along the circles in the graph @xmath44 are the identity in @xmath2 and if @xmath57 denote the connection which give the trivial holonomy , as @xmath58 the function @xmath59 become increasingly peaked around @xmath57 .",
    "the width of the peak is regulated by the gaussian parameter @xmath60 .",
    "we are interested in exploring the main features of the state @xmath61 and in showing that it satisfies the weave conditions ( [ expvalues ] ) , and ( [ deviations ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we begin expanding the cylindrical function @xmath55 into the de - pietri - rovelli spin - network basis .",
    "the only elements of the basis that have a non - vanishing contribution are given by , _",
    "j = tr[(h_e_i^(a)h_e_i^(a))_(j ) ] , [ basis ] based on the graph @xmath44 , where the subindex @xmath62 denote the ` color ' representation of @xmath2 .",
    "this choice arises because @xmath63 can be written as a linear expansion of spin - network states _ some _ of which are eigenstates of the area operator for an arbitrary analytic surface @xmath25 that intersect the graph @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that these states are not eigenstates of the area operator for _ any _ surface is particularly interesting and deserves further explanation .    on the full hilbert space @xmath10 , and for gauge - invariant cylindrical functions",
    "@xmath64 . this will be useful because it permits the transition to the loop representation where from the beginning one restrict oneself to gauge invariant states ( spin - network states ) .",
    "] , the spectrum of the area operator @xmath65 is unbounded from above and the ` area gap ' , which is the smallest non - zero eigenvalue , is given in the special situation when the graph intersect the surface @xmath25 with an -up or down- edge and a tangential edge at a bivalent vertex @xmath66 @xcite . if a single edge intersect the surface ( without crossing @xmath25 ) , or if the edges that meets at the vertex @xmath66 are _ all _ ` up ' or ` down ' , the gauss law constraint implies that the corresponding eigenvalue be @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , to obtain non - trivial eigenvalues of the area operator is necessary that the edges of the graph ` cross ' the surface @xmath25 .",
    "this means that for the system of circles @xmath44 , the state ( [ basis ] ) is an eigenstate of the area operator with non - trivial eigenvalues if at least one of the circles crosses @xmath25 , that is , if the same circle intersect the surface in two points ( vertices ) .",
    "if one or both of the circles only ` touch ' the surface in one point , the arcs that meet that point will be at the same side of @xmath25 and the corresponding eigenvalue would be @xmath67 as was stated above .",
    "the maximum number of intersections between @xmath44 and the surface is @xmath68 and is obtained when both circles cross @xmath25 .    on the other hand ,",
    "given the spin - network @xmath69 which assigns the labelling @xmath70 to the circles @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the graph @xmath44 with the @xmath62 representation of @xmath2 , and a labelling @xmath71 of the single tetravalent vertex of @xmath44 with an invariant tensor @xmath72 , that is , an intertwining tensor from the representations of the incoming edges to the representations of the outgoing edges .",
    "the spin - network states can be constructed by contracting the matrices associated to the @xmath62 representation of the circles on @xmath44 with the intertwining tensor @xmath72 at the tetravalent vertex . the basis element ( [ basis ] ) when written in the spin - network ( state ) expansion , correspond to the choice of a particular basis of the space of the invariant tensor of the tetravalent vertex , and is given by the fig .",
    "[ 4v ] in the de pietri - rovelli notation @xcite .    graphically , the choice of the basis in the space of invariant tensors is equivalent to the ` decomposition ' of the tetravalent vertex into a trivalent graph with two vertices joined by a ` virtual ' edge @xmath73 .",
    "since the clebsh - gordan condition must hold in each of the trivalent vertices , the only allowed value for the virtual vertex is @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we would be lead to the conclusion that the basis element ( [ basis ] ) is an eigenstate of the area operator .",
    "this is true in general , but it remains the subtle case when the tetravalent vertex of the graph @xmath44 _ lies _ on the surface @xmath25 .",
    "there are two possible ( non - generic ) configurations in this special case :    1 .",
    "the first configuration is obtained when the surface @xmath25 divides the graph @xmath44 into two halfs .",
    "each of them has a part of the circle @xmath45 _ and _ a part of the circle @xmath46 .",
    "in this situation , ( [ basis ] ) has no contribution to the area coming from the vertex ( since @xmath74 ) and is then an eigenstate of the area operator with eigenvalues proportional to @xmath75 for each intersection of the circles with @xmath25 .",
    "the other ` non - generic ' configuration is realized when the surface @xmath25 divides the graph @xmath44 in such way that one of the circles , say @xmath45 , is entirely placed on one side of the surface and the circle @xmath46 on the other . in this case the basis ( [ basis ] ) is _ not _ an eigenstate of the area operator and it is indispensable the use of the recoupling theorem @xcite in order to perform the suitable change of basis in which the area operator can take a diagonal form .",
    "even when the state is written in a diagonal form , there will be in general contributions from eigenstates with different eigenvalues for the area .    at first sight",
    "this seems to be a problem when expanding the gaussian function ( [ fg ] ) into the basis elements ( [ basis ] ) but a closer look shows that the number of ` pathological ' configurations represents a zero measure set in the collection of all possible configurations .",
    "however , even though the configurations with the tetravalent vertex on @xmath25 do not contribute in a significant way to the expansion of the function ( [ fg ] ) , they are at the same time , conceptually relevant .",
    "the fact that not every spin - network state is an eigenstate of the area operator , in the case when the vertex has valence four or more , was noted earlier @xcite , but seems not to be widely recognized in the literature .",
    "this particular feature leads to the conclusion that the area operators of two surfaces that intersect along a line fail to commute for states which have 4 or higher valent vertex in the intersection .",
    "thus , the quantum riemannian geometry that arises from loop gravity is intrinsically non - commutativity @xcite .",
    "therefore , some questions arise concerning the semi - classical regime of the theory : under what conditions do we expect to obtain a commutative geometry in the semi - classical approach ? if the notion of the weave is a good candidate to describe classical space , what are the conditions on the weave states in order to reconcile our classical notion of a commutative geometry ?",
    "these issues are under current study .",
    "once we have shown that it is plausible to expand the cylindrical function ( [ fg ] ) into the basis ( [ basis ] ) we proceed to determine the coefficients of the linear expansion @xmath76 to be able to evaluate the expectation values of the area @xmath77 , the volume @xmath78 and their corresponding deviations .",

    "j , [ gphi ] we would want to evaluate the sum in the index @xmath80 of the equation ( [ gphi ] ) but it can not be done exactly . therefore , one is forced to use the definition of hermite polynomials in its series expansion an evaluate the expression numerically .",

    "a numerical evaluation of equation ( [ coeff ] ) was performed and shows , with the normalization @xmath86 , that the series converges in the interval @xmath87 and for values above @xmath88 a peak starts to grow at the fundamental representation .",
    "[ cc ] shows some coefficients for some values of @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to stress out that for larger values of the color @xmath62 the expansion continues , but in this case a numerical evaluation turns out to be inappropriate due to float point errors .",
    "the most important and intriguing difference between the ` quasi - coherent ' weave @xcite and the ` gaussian ' weave is that , in the last case the peak of the coefficients ( [ coeff ] ) in the basis of spin - network states is centered around the fundamental representation @xmath89 .",
    "the dominance of the fundamental representation in other physical situation such as the bh entropy seems to point to a deep role played by the fundamental representation in loop quantum gravity .",
    "the origin of this behavior deserves further attention .",
    "one can get a closed formula for the expectation value for the area in the state @xmath55 using the machinery of recoupling theory @xcite in the loop representation a = _ k^_j^c_k^*c_j . where the bracket can be evaluated chromatically to show that the basis states are normalized . thus , the expectation value of the area operator is given by ,    a = ( 8 ^ 2)_j^|c_j|^2 .    in the case of the volume operator ,",
    "a closed formula for the expectation value is not available .",
    "however , we know that the largest eigenvalue in the state @xmath90 increase as @xmath91 and we can make an estimation . for the particular value of the gaussian width @xmath92 we have the following expectation values for the geometric operators and their respective dispersions :    [ evaluations ] = 1.149(8 ^ 2 ) ; _",

    "our state @xmath55 is peaked in area and volume as in a similar fashion as the proposal given in @xcite , but with better accuracy .",

    "in this work we have proposed a basic cylindrical function with a gaussian dependence on the group element .",
    "this function can be used , in particular , to construct a weave state a la grot - rovelli .",
    "the particular proposal has the desired features of a weave state plus a peakedness property around the fundamental representation .",
    "there exists a striking similarity between the main contribution of the state in the fundamental representation and the dominating states , in the statistical counting , that contributes to the entropy of an ` isolated horizon ' .",

    "it is important to understand if the gaussian ansatz presented here yields an equivalent or inequivalent quantum theory to the one constructed in @xcite .",
    "there are also coherent states constructed using ` infinite tensor product hilbert spaces ' @xcite .",
    "the relation of this method to the algebraic gns construction remains unclear and deserves further attention .",
