    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation represents a fundamental observable for cosmology and at present the most powerful one for the investigation of several open questions , such as the nature of inflation or primordial non - gaussianity . in two years the planck satellite @xcite will provide a measure of the anisotropies of the cmb with a precision never reached before , that will allow a highly precise determination of the standard cosmological parameters as well as major constraints on some non - standard physics processes .",
    "the observation of cmb anisotropies is affected by several systematics and secondary effects due to the fact that the cmb is not the only source of emission in the microwave frequencies and to the formation of structures between the observer and the last scattering surface @xcite .",
    "the great accuracy of future data requires a compelling description of these effects , in order to separate the different contributions to the anisotropies and to distinguish primordial and secondary effects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the observable used to extract most of the cosmological information from the cmb is the angular power spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "secondary effects or unresolved foregrounds provide a contribution to the observed @xmath0 . in order to obtain an unbiased determination of the cosmological parameters from cmb maps",
    "it is necessary to correctly describe possible contaminations . on the other hand ,",
    "both contaminants and secondary effects themselves contain certain cosmological and astrophysical information , especially on the formation of structure at late - times and the large - scale structure of the universe , so that the separation of these components from primordial cmb fluctuations becomes an important science goal on its own .",
    "the galactic emission and radio point sources are typical examples of foreground contamination in cmb maps .",
    "while the bright sources detected in maps can be removed with a suitable mask before the estimation of the angular power spectrum , unresolved point sources will contribute to the total anisotropy power spectrum @xmath0 .    the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , caused by the compton scattering of the cmb photons by the electrons in the universe , is a well - known secondary anisotropy studied by a variety of experiments .",
    "the sz effect contains cosmological information , since the angular power spectrum of secondary temperature anisotropy arising from sz scattering depends on both the gas distribution in galaxy clusters and on the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "since the sz thermal effect has a unique spectral signature relative to the cmb thermal spectrum , the sz signal can be distinguished from primary cmb anisotropies and other foregrounds using observations at multiple frequencies across the sz null at @xmath2 ghz @xcite .",
    "such a separation , however , is not feasible with kinetic sz effect associated with peculiar motions of the electrons scattering the cmb @xcite as the signal has the same spectrum as that of the cmb . even for the sz thermal effect , in realistic experiments ,",
    "the main obstacles that limit a clear detection of the thermal signal comes from uncertainties in the modeling of the kinetic contribution and the difficulty of separating sz effects from clustered point sources .",
    "the contribution of unresolved point sources and sz effect is best seen on small angular scales where they dominate the total cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "the use of data at these small angular scales is hence becoming decisive in the analysis of cmb data . in this work",
    "we analyze large @xmath3 data ( up to @xmath4 ) from the south pole telescope ( spt ) at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ghz @xcite and from atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite at @xmath5 ghz combined with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data after @xmath7 years of observation @xcite to put constraints on the two @xmath8 effects .    in previous studies significant limitations came from uncertainties associated with clustering of dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfg ) that contribute to high - frequency cmb data .",
    "such clustering has now been measured with both _",
    "@xcite and planck @xcite experiments . in the context of cmb studies , _",
    "herschel _ measurements are most useful as they probe the dsfg clustering down to sub - arcminute angular scales at scales well matched to arcminute scale cmb experiments while planck measurements are limited to scales greater than 5@xmath9 or @xmath10 . in this work",
    "we describe the clustering of unresolved point sources we used the same template of @xcite , where the authors reported a detection of both the linear clustering and the non - linear clustering at a few arcminute scales , corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "we perform a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis constraining both the thermal and the kinetic terms of the sz effect together with the the poisson and clustering corrections due to unresolved point sources , including radio sources at lower frequencies such as 150 ghz . in the next section we recall more details on the contribution of the sz effect and foregrounds to the cmb anisotropy power spectra .",
    "section  3 describes the parametrization and the templates we used to model the foreground and the sz contamination to the cmb angular anisotropy power spectrum . in section  4 we show the results and conclude with a summary .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the adopted parametrizations and templates for the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , unresolved extragalactic point source foregrounds and lensing .",
    "the sz effect has two different contributions , one from the thermal motion of the electrons ( thermal sz effect - _ tsz _ ) and one from the bulk motion of the electrons relative to the cmb ( kinetic sz - _ ksz _ ) .",
    "the former contribution has a distinct frequency dependence , while the ksz effect causes only a doppler shift of the incident cmb spectrum retaining the black body shape",
    ". the total sz signal in a generic direction @xmath12 is then given by ( see for example section  @xmath13 in @xcite ) : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the expected thermal contribution at frequency @xmath18 .",
    "from @xmath19 it can easily seen that the thermal sz effect vanishes at @xmath20 ghz .",
    "we model the sz contributions to the anisotropy angular power spectrum , relative to a template power spectrum , as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the template spectrum for either thermal or kinetic sz . in this work",
    "we consider the sz templates from @xcite , computed by tracing through a dark matter simulation and processed to include gas in dark matter halos and in the filamentary intergalactic medium .",
    "the thermal sz template describes the power from tsz temperature fluctuations from all clusters for a universe normalized with amplitude of matter fluctuations @xmath24 .",
    "in particular we use the standard model of @xcite , that was first described in @xcite , and assuming a @xmath1 scaling given by @xmath25 as found in @xcite . for these templates the reference values at @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath28    the foregrounds contribution to the cmb power spectrum at arcminute angular scales arises essentially from unresolved extragalactic point sources .",
    "these sources provide two contributions , a poisson term due to the random discrete distribution and a clustering term accounting for the large - scale distribution of the sources .",
    "we assume the poisson term as constant in @xmath29 , modeling it as @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the clustered term can be similarly expressed as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the point sources clustering template and @xmath34 encodes the frequency scaling ( see section 3 for further details ) .",
    "contribution to point sources comes from radio point sources and dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfg ) . at 220 ghz",
    "the main point source contribution is mainly dsfgs while at 150 ghz the point sources are primarily radio sources with a synchrotron spectrum .",
    "we therefore neglect the clustering of radio sources and assume that the contribution from radio sources is essentially described only by a poisson behavior . for clustered dsfgs",
    "we adopt the template from @xcite where the authors reported a detection of both the linear clustering and the excess of clustering associated with the 1-halo term at arcminute scales .",
    "those data are from the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extra - galactic survey ( hermes ) @xcite , taken with the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) onboard the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "it is well known that gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies by large - scale structure tends to increase the power at small angular scales ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a proper calculation of this effect is hence necessary in order to prevent an incorrect estimate of the foregrounds and sz parameters .",
    "the calculation of lensed cmb spectra out to @xmath35 is prohibitively expensive in computational time . instead , we approximate the impact of lensing by adding a fixed lensing template @xmath36 computed by running ` camb ` @xcite with and without the lensing option and taking the difference between these spectra . in this",
    "run the cosmological parameters of the @xmath37cdm model are fixed at the best fit values wmap7 .",
    "in @xcite it has been estimated that the error due to this approximation is less than @xmath38k@xmath39 at @xmath40 and is hence negligible with respect to secondary and foregrounds contributions .",
    "the lensing contribution is clearly frequency independent .",
    "we place constraints on the cosmological parameters and on the sz and foregrounds parameters using the @xmath7-years wmap data in combination with the spt data at @xmath5 ghz and at @xmath6 ghz , and the act data at @xmath41 ghz .",
    "the spt and act datasets are necessary to analyze the smaller scales of the power spectrum where point sources and sz are dominant . for the spt data we select the single frequency @xmath42 blocks from the full @xmath43 covariance matrix provided by the spt collaboration ( see @xcite ) , neglecting the correlation between different frequencies .",
    "we use a @xmath44-parameter flat-@xmath37cdm cosmological model to describe primary cmb anisotropies and reionization : the baryon and dark matter physical energy densities @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the reionization optical depth @xmath47 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at the decoupling @xmath48 , the amplitude of the curvature perturbation @xmath49 ( with flat prior on @xmath50 ) and the spectral index @xmath51 ; these two last parameters are both defined at the pivot scale @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the standard cosmological parameters we include the sz and foreground parameters described in the previous section .",
    "we perform a monte carlo markov chain analysis based on the publicly available package ` cosmomc ` @xcite suitably modified to account for the additional parameters , with a convergence diagnostic based on the gelman and rubin statistics . when estimating parameters with point sources and sz included , the total cmb anisotropy spectra are three , one for each frequency plus the cross - correlation term , because of the frequency dependence of the secondary anisotropies .",
    "in order to study the stability of our results on the assumed parametrization , we perform three different analysis , both with @xmath44 additional parameters describing sz effect and foregrounds , but considering different parametrizations .    in the first case , that we define as `` run1 '' in what follows , we consider the sz effect parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the poissonian contribution @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the poisson contribution for the 150@xmath58220 ghz cross - correlation @xmath59 .",
    "the use of the @xmath59 extra parameter for the cross correlation of poisson point source can be justified from the possibility that the contribution at one single frequency comes from more than one point source population and that the two channels are not fully correlated .",
    "this possibility has not been considered in previous analyses and is therefore important to evaluate the impact of this assumption .",
    "finally we consider a _",
    "single _ clustered point sources parameter , @xmath60 , scaling the contribution at different frequencies using the relation of @xcite :    @xmath61    with @xmath62 , following recent results from planck @xcite . in what follows",
    "we refer to this scaling as `` gispert '' scaling .    in summary ,",
    "the spectra in `` run1 '' are defined as :    @xmath63    the thermal sz effect is negligible at @xmath6 ghz .",
    "the contribution of the thermal sz effect to the cross - correlated power spectrum may not vanish in presence of a spatial correlation between ir sources and the clusters that cause the thermal sz .",
    "nevertheless as showed in @xcite the effect of this correlation is negligible for the spt data ( see par . 7.4 in @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we hence do not consider this contribution when fitting the data .",
    "in the second analysis , to which in what follows we refer as `` run2 '' , we assume full correlation between the poisson point sources signal at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ghz as done in previous analyses , i.e. we fix the cross amplitude of poisson point sources at the square root of the product of the amplitudes at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath64 . moreover , we do nt scale the clustered point sources template and we use instead two different parameters for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ghz .",
    "this second analysis is more similar to the one presented in @xcite , however we point out that while here we consider the amplitudes at different frequencies as free parameters , @xcite considered the amplitudes at one single frequency and one common frequency spectral index for clustered and point sources as free parameters .    in this second case",
    "the foreground spectra are defined as :    @xmath65    finally we combine @xmath5 ghz data of spt and act , using separate parameters for act and spt both for clustered and poisson point sources , to account for the different masking thresholds of the point sources . in this case",
    "we have :    @xmath66    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "in table  [ spt_tab ] we report the mean values of the cosmological parameters and their @xmath67 c.l . uncertainty from spt data at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ghz for the `` run1 '' and `` run2 '' analyses , while in table  [ spt_act_tab ] we list the mean values of the cosmological parameters and their @xmath67 c.l . uncertainty from act data",
    "( `` run3 '' ) combined with spt data at @xmath5 ghz . in order to facilitate the comparison with other works present in the literature we also translate the constraints on the foregrounds amplitudes in to the foreground power spectrum at @xmath26 , @xmath68 .",
    "since a significant correlation exists between thermal and kinetic sz and since the kinetic sz is predicted to be small , we also perform an analysis by fixing @xmath69 .",
    "we find that for the `` run1 '' case the thermal sz anisotropy amplitude is @xmath70 . while a @xmath71 indication for sz is present our result is less significant than the one reported by @xcite with @xmath72 i.e. with a thermal sz detection at at more than two standard deviations .",
    "the result on the kinetic sz component are compatible , with @xmath73 at @xmath74 c.l . from our analysis to be compared with @xmath75 from @xcite .",
    "[ h ! ]   and @xmath76 c.l .",
    "constraints on @xmath77 and @xmath78 from act @xmath5 ghz data ( red ) and spt all frequencies data ( blue ) for the run2 case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    although the point sources and sz parameters do not show significant degeneracies with cosmological parameters ( see also @xcite ) , a strong correlation exists between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and to a smaller extent between @xmath79 and @xmath60 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ sz ] where we show the @xmath80 likelihood constraints in the plane @xmath81 for the `` run2 '' and `` run3 '' case . fixing the ksz term sligthly",
    "improves the detection for the thermal sz with @xmath82 in `` run1 '' but still with less significance than the one in @xcite where a value of @xmath83 is reported .",
    "based on the degeneracy direction of figure  [ sz ] , we constrain the sum of the sz effects at @xmath26 to be @xmath84 @xmath85k@xmath39 to be compared @xmath86 @xmath85k@xmath39 of @xcite . these amplitudes are consistent but , again , the significance of the detection is worse than @xcite who found this sum to be @xmath86 @xmath85k@xmath39 .",
    "the small discrepancy with the results presented in @xcite comes essentially from the different parametrization used .",
    "adopting a more similar parametrization as in the case of `` run2 '' we found @xmath87 , @xmath88 at @xmath74 c.l .",
    ", @xmath89 @xmath85k@xmath39 , yielding a detection for the thermal sz with higher significance .",
    "in case of fixed ksz we obtain @xmath90 , again a more significant detection in better agreement with @xcite .",
    "the different assumptions in the frequency scaling of the clustered point sources component in `` run1 '' and `` run2 '' is the main explanation for the difference in the results . in `` run1 '' , taking into account gispert scaling @xcite , we find @xmath91 , while in `` run2 '' , when the amplitude of the clustering point sources is allowed to vary , we have @xmath92 , that is more consistent with the corresponding value of @xmath93 reported in @xcite .",
    "a small tension therefore exists between the gispert scaling and the data at @xmath6 ghz , resulting also in a worse determination of the thermal sz signal .",
    "the use of a different parametrization of the point source ( just amplitudes in our case while @xcite varies one amplitude and one spectral index per component ) can explain the remaining differences .",
    "concerning the poisson point sources component at @xmath5 ghz , our results are different when directly compared to those from @xcite , both in `` run1 '' and `` run2 '' . at @xmath5 ghz",
    "we find @xmath94 in `` run1 '' and @xmath95 in `` run2 '' , while the value in @xcite is @xmath96 .",
    "this difference is explained in straightforward terms if we take in account that in @xcite radio galaxies are included in their `` baseline model '' with an amplitude @xmath97 with a @xmath98 uncertainty .",
    "clustering of radio galaxies is negligible , so this radio galaxies term is a poisson like term of the form @xmath99 . adding this component , our poisson amplitudes are consistent with those reported by @xcite within @xmath100 .",
    "in `` run1 '' at @xmath5 ghz we find @xmath94 , while in @xcite the correspondent total poisson contribution at @xmath26 is about @xmath101 . at @xmath6 ghz",
    "we find @xmath102 in `` run1 '' and @xmath103 in `` run2 '' , while the value in @xcite is @xmath104 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the current results presented in the literature on the amplitude of the secondary anisotropies should be considered with great care since there is a clear dependence on the parametrization used , on the frequency scaling adopted and on the assumed templates .",
    "we stress that , a part for small discrepancies imputable to differences in the parameterization , all our results for the sz amplitudes from the analysis of spt data both for our `` run1 '' and `` run2 '' cases , are substantially consistent with the analysis of the same data made by @xcite , even if we are finding less tight constraints .",
    "our results hence compare in the same way to the recent predictions of tsz power made by the models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite confirming that these models overestimate the power of the tsz signal , as already found in @xcite .",
    "ghz and spt data at @xmath6 ghz ( white points ) compared with the combination ( solid black line ) of the poisson term ( green line ) and clustering term ( red ) of unresolved point sources by scaling the best - fit model to measurements made with _ herschel _ at 350 @xmath85 m to 217 ghz using the frequency scaling of @xcite .",
    "we show the 1-halo ( pink ) and 2-halo ( orange ) contributions to the clustering term following @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines are the @xmath6 ghz spt dsfg power spectrum components from @xcite , which resulted in an overestimate of planck dsfg clustering at @xmath105 . ]    in figure [ cib ] we show the recent cib power spectra data of the planck collaboration @xcite at 217 ghz and small angular scale cmb power spectrum data from spt , at 220 ghz , with a comparison to scaled measurements from @xcite .",
    "model is shown in terms of the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions to the total power spectrum . for reference",
    ", we also show the model used by @xcite at 220 ghz to describe the clustering of dsfgs , which overestimated the power at tens of arcminute angular scales and above relative to _ herschel _ and planck dsfg clustering measurements .",
    "@xcite used a linear model to analyze their data . at small angular scales",
    "non - linear effects are not negligible and using a linear model to interpret the data may lead to a wrong determination of the bias and hence to an overestimation of the power at larger angular scales ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "instead our model shows a good fit of both planck and spt cib .    in figure  [ spectra ]",
    "we show the best fit models for each component compared with the spt and wmap7 data . in the `` run1 '' , when only one amplitude of clustered dsfgs is allowed to vary when fitting the all frequencies spt data combined with wmap7 data , we find that @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests that the combination of @xcite model and the frequency scaling for the mean cib is a good fit of the dsfg clustering at lower cmb frequencies .",
    "higher precision cmb power spectra at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath107 ghz and a direct cross - correlation of _",
    "herschel_-spire maps against the cmb will be necessary to study if fluctuations scale with frequency as the mean cib intensity and to improve overall constraints on secondary anisotropies .",
    "in conclusion , we provided a new analysis of the foreground contribution to the cmb data making use of the latest act and spt results .",
    "our work is complementary to those presented by the spt and act experimental teams since we use a different parametrization of the foregrounds contribution and different templates .",
    "the foreground contribution from poisson point sources at @xmath6 and @xmath5 ghz is detected with very high significance ( at more than @xmath108 standard deviations ) with no particular dependence on the parametrization used ( `` run1 '' and `` run2 '' cases are giving very consistent results ) .",
    "the contribution from clustered point sources is also well detected at @xmath6 ghz .",
    "we have found that current cmb data favours a larger contribution at this frequency than the one expected by the gispert frequency scaling once the data is normalized at @xmath5 ghz .",
    "the thermal sz component is detected at a level slightly above the two standard deviations .",
    "however a different parametrization of the components and the assumption of the gispert scaling could bring this detection to about one standard deviation .",
    "the correlation with the kinetic sz term is present in the data despite the multi - frequency approach .",
    "more data at more frequencies are clearly needed to establish a strong detection of the sz term .",
    "while our constraints do not improve the results in the literature , we have made a significant addition to prior studies by firmly establishing the power spectrum of dsfgs that dominate the arcminute scale cmb anisotropies at 220 ghz and higher frequencies .",
    "this comes from the recent _ herschel _ results combined with planck - confirmed frequency spectrum for the cib mean intensity . in future",
    ", additional improvements will come from directly cross - correlating the cmb maps against high - resolution cib maps from _ herschel _ ; for this a _",
