    "self - consistent mean - field models are nowadays the standard tool for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "their quality has reached a level where one needs to take into account correlation effects beyond mean field , particularly those which are related to low - energy- or symmetry - modes .",
    "typical examples are center - of - mass projection , particle - number projection , angular - momentum projection or quadrupole surface vibrations .",
    "there is a large variety of techniques to deal with those correlations , for a review see @xcite .",
    "the most widely used ones are the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , see e.g. @xcite , and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the latter has close links to projection formulae .",
    "the rpa has the advantage that it provides simple equations because it employs only second order commutators of the basic one - body operators with the hamiltonian .",
    "however , it runs into difficulties with soft modes which arise typically near transition points .",
    "the gcm is very general and extremely robust , but also very cumbersome to handle .",
    "thus one has developed simplifications in the aim to use also preferably second order expressions .",
    "this is achieved by the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) to gcm , for details see the review @xcite .",
    "gcm - goa is a fair compromise between the generality of gcm and the simplicity of rpa .",
    "it uses up to second order anti - commutators but can still deal with large amplitude collective motion .",
    "second order approximation within the spirit of goa have also been widely applied to projection schemes .",
    "the standard recipe @xmath0 for center of mass correction belongs to this class @xcite .",
    "the similarly simple rotational correction @xmath1 has been widely employed , e.g. in the large scale fits of @xcite .",
    "and there is the well known lipkin - nogami approach for particle - number projection @xcite .",
    "however , one has to be aware that the goa is not always performing well .",
    "for example , it fails for rotational motion in weakly deformed systems and for particle number projection in the regime of weak pairing .",
    "the failure can be related to the topology of the collective coordinate under consideration .",
    "goa is well suited for cartesian coordinates which extend in the interval @xmath2 with constant volume element .",
    "the best example is here center of mass motion .",
    "but goa is not necessarily appropriate for other topologies as , e.g. , rotational motion whose coordinates are defined on a sphere .",
    "it can still work if the overlaps are falling off very quickly .",
    "but regimes of weak coupling have broad overlaps and thus the topology of the underlying coordinates is fully explored .",
    "it needs to be built in into the approximation .",
    "an example for rotational motion is found in @xcite .",
    "a most general construction for any topology is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the changes are , in fact , obvious and simple .",
    "it amounts to building the topology of the coordinates into the parameterization of the goa .",
    "we call the emerging approach a topologically corrected gaussian overlap approximation ( topgoa ) .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate the accuracy of the topgoa for two cases most relevant in nuclear structure calculations , deformations and particle - number projection .",
    "we compare topgoa with rpa as well as full gcm and simple goa .",
    "furthermore , we derive a small amplitude limit of topgoa which gives at the end very simple and compact formulae for the collective ground - state correlations , in a sense comparable to rpa .",
    "we call that approach toprpa . in both test cases",
    "we employ a suitable generalization of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite .",
    "this section provides a brief summary of traditionally well known approaches for collective correlations , rpa and gcm up to goa .",
    "the rpa theory is perhaps the most straightforward treatment of correlations beyond mean field theory .",
    "it gives the leading corrections in the limit of large number of interacting particles . with the rpa ,",
    "one calculates an excitation spectrum of eigenfrequencies @xmath3 and the associated particle - hole operators @xmath4 that generate the eigenmodes .",
    "these modes are also present in the rpa ground state as zero - point motion , leading to a rpa theory of the ground state correlation energy , see e.g. @xcite . for a single mode ,",
    "the rpa correlation energy is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6|\\phi_0\\rangle\\ ] ] and @xmath7 is the mean field ground state .",
    "in the case the mode corresponds to a broken continuous symmetry , @xmath8 and the formula should be applied by taking the @xmath9 limit .",
    "it is also advantageous in that case to separate the generators into time - even and time - odd @xmath10 the @xmath11 is usually the generator of a collective deformation , for example a center - of - mass shift in case of the translational mode .",
    "particle - number projection is an example where the time - even operator @xmath12 spans the collective space .",
    "the rpa correlation energy ( [ eq : rpacorr ] ) can fail due to double counting if one employs a sum over a large rpa spectrum @xcite , but double counting is negligible if only a few collective modes are used @xcite .",
    "that is the line of approach followed here . for a most recent survey of rpa correlations along that line ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it will be taken up explicitly in the applications later on .",
    "the most general technique for constructing collective modes is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "it utilizes a superposition of wave functions defined along some collective deformation path @xmath13 .",
    "each state @xmath14 along this path is an independent particle state ( or independent quasi - particle state in case of bcs ) .",
    "the correlated wave function is given by @xmath15 where the superposition function @xmath16 is determined by the griffin - hill - wheeler equation    [ eq : ghw ] @xmath17f(q ' )    =    0    \\quad , \\\\   & &    { \\cal h}(q , q ' )    =    \\langle q|\\hat{h}|{q'}\\rangle    \\quad , \\\\    & &    { \\cal i}(q , q ' )    =    \\langle q|{q'}\\rangle    \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    normalizing @xmath18 , the correlation energy is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ground state of the underlying independent particle model .",
    "the gcm can be easily generalized to multiple modes .",
    "one simply generalizes @xmath21 to a vector of deformations and extends @xmath22 to a multi - dimensional integral , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the gcm is often applied in this straightforward , but tedious , manner where the overlaps and the solution of the griffin - hill - wheeler equation are determined numerically , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the full gcm is much more elaborate than rpa because one deals with the overlaps for any combination of @xmath21 and @xmath23 and the highly non - local griffin - hill - wheeler equation .",
    "a dramatic simplification is achieved by the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) .",
    "it represents the dependence of the overlaps on the difference @xmath24 by a gaussian times a polynomial in @xmath25 .",
    "the overlap is represented as a pure gaussian , @xmath26    with    @xmath27    one usually goes up to second order derivatives in the expression for the hamiltonian    @xmath28    for further details , see @xcite . the goa yields a dramatic simplification of the griffin - hill - wheeler equation .",
    "assuming that the coefficients depend only weakly on @xmath29 , one can recast the griffin - hill - wheeler equation into a collective schrdinger equation with a simple second derivative as operator for the kinetic energy .",
    "large amplitudes in average collective deformation @xmath30 are still allowed .",
    "thus the gcm - goa is applicable to conditions of large fluctuation as are typical for low - energy modes and for symmetry projection .",
    "a further dramatic simplification emerges if one restricts the considerations to small amplitudes also in @xmath30 .",
    "then collective dynamics becomes harmonic and all expressions can be worked out analytically .",
    "the final result is then just the rpa @xcite . the correlations from gcm - goa become then identical to the rpa correlations as given the above subsection [ sec : rpacorr ] .",
    "however , the goa has its limitations .",
    "the gaussian ansatz assumes tacitly that the collective coordinate spans the interval @xmath31 in other words , the dynamics is fundamentally cartesian in the collective coordinates .",
    "this is certainly true for some situations , e.g. the center - of - mass motion where each coordinate @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 runs over @xmath2 .",
    "but the presupposition is violated in many cases . in particular , in rotational motion the rotation angles are restricted to finite intervals with periodic boundary conditions . for such situations the goa can be generalized by modifying the the arguments of the gaussian to correctly include the topology of the collective mode @xcite .",
    "we call this generalization the topological goa ( topgoa ) .",
    "the details of topgoa depend , of course , on the actual mode under considerations . in the following , we exemplify and test topgoa for two typical and most important applications in nuclear physics : deformations and particle - number projection .",
    "the projection is straightforward and yields immediately expressions in second order throughout .",
    "the efficient treatment of deformations remains an important problem in nuclear structure .",
    "the theory should provide accurate correlation energies , going from the small - amplitude vibrational limit to the large amplitude static deformations and including the soft region in between .",
    "these applications will serve as a critical testing ground for the toprpa , and the small amplitude approximation to topgoa .",
    "the usual two - level lipkin - meshkov - glick hamiltonian has been widely used to model the collective motion of in a deformation coordinate , as it contains the vibrational and static deformation limits with the mean - field phase transition in between .",
    "however , the model does not have a continuous symmetry , which is an important aspect of the deformations . to include a continuous symmetry ,",
    "we have extended the space in the lipkin - meskov - glick model to three levels , and call the extended model the three - level model .",
    "two of the levels are degenerate in the three - level , and the interactions treats those levels identically .",
    "this introduces a symmetry mode with the topology of rotations in a plane . for clarity",
    "we repeat here the definition of the three - level model ; for details see @xcite .",
    "the three levels are labelled 0,1 , and 2 .",
    "the basic @xmath35 transitions @xmath36 are induced by @xmath37 and those to state 2 by @xmath38 .",
    "the amount of excitation is measured by @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 operators obey a quasi - spin algebra .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads    @xmath41    the exact solution of this hamiltonian is obtained by diagonalization in the space of @xmath42 .",
    "the three - level hamiltonian is the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamlmg3 ] ) .",
    "it defines the energetic relations amongst the levels .",
    "note that the two excited states @xmath43 are degenerate .",
    "this gives the model the rotational symmetry .",
    "the second term in ( [ eq : hamlmg3 ] ) models a two - body interaction .",
    "it is again symmetric in @xmath44 which maintains rotational symmetry .",
    "the strength is regulated by @xmath45 , defined to be dimensionless coupling strength .",
    "we will see later that @xmath46 is the critical point in the model separating weak and string coupling .",
    "it is convenient to analyze the many - particle wave function in terms of collective variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the collective wave function is defined @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the normalization is given by @xmath51 note that the model is rotationally invariant in the angle @xmath48 .",
    "the motion in @xmath47 corresponds to collective vibrations .",
    "the system is close to a good vibrator for small residual interaction , @xmath52 .",
    "it is a rigid rotator for large @xmath53 .",
    "the transitional regime @xmath46 explores collective motion with large amplitude fluctuations .",
    "two subtle details need to be mentioned : first , there is only one rotational degree - of - freedom which means that the model corresponds to rotations in a plane .",
    "second , the vibrational degree - of - freedom contains relevant information only in the interval @xmath54 , similar to the vibrational mode in the usual lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",

    "the topgoa performs very well in all regimes .",
    "the results improve with increasing system size as one could expect from the gaussian limit theorem inherent in topgoa .",
    "acceptable results are obtained from topgoa also for @xmath74=4 .",
    "but all approaches become inaccurate for @xmath74=2 which is obviously not collective enough .",
    "when the mean - field ground state breaks a symmetry of the hamiltonian , one can get an improved wave function and energy by projection , i.e. take a minimal set of states @xmath21 and appropriate @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) to enforce the symmetry .",
    "this is particularly useful for deformations and projection of the @xmath75 ground state ground state out of a deformed intrinsic state .",
    "the questions before us are , how does this technique compare with the rpa or the topgoa for computing the correlation energy ? it should be noted that the projection method has a formal advantage in that the calculated energy is an upper bound of the true energy associated with the hamiltonian",
    ".      we will examine how well the projection technique works for the three - level model as test case .",
    "rotational projection on the ground state angular momentum @xmath76 reads simply @xmath77 the rotationally projected energy is computed as expectation value which amounts to integrating the overlaps over the angular coordinate @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath78 this is simple and straightforward for the topgoa overlaps of the form ( [ eq : topgoarot ] ) .",
    "we thus can skip the details .",
    "the energy ( [ eq : proje ] ) can be computed for any given deformation @xmath47 .",
    "the hf ground state deformation @xmath59 is obtained from minimizing the mere hf energy ( [ eq : collpot ] ) . applying the projection on this state corresponds to the scheme `` variation - before - projection '' .",
    "it serves to correct for the angular momentum fluctuations in the deformed hf ground state .",
    "a much better approach is obtained when performing `` variation - after - projection '' @xcite .",
    "here one minimizes the projected energy ( [ eq : proje ] ) .",
    "this is an involved task for exact projection .",
    "the topgoa approach yields a simple expression for the projected energy on which a variation is still feasible .",
    "it is , of course , particularly simple in the present test case .",
    "we just have to search for the deformation @xmath79 which minimizes @xmath80 .",
    "variation - before - projection and variation - after - projection are compared in figure [ fig : demo_vap ] for a large range of coupling strengths .",
    "the upper panel shows the ground state deformations .",
    "the variation - before - projection state stays spherical up the critical point and switches to deformation with a discontinuous derivate ( second order transition ) .",
    "the variation - after - projection states develop more smoothly and show a steady growth of deformation .",
    "variation - after - projection can afford intrinsic deformations because it `` knows '' that projection will restore spherical symmetry .",
    "the freedom which variation - after - projection exploits will yield a lower energy .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : demo_vap ] .",
    "it is obvious that variation - after - projection picks up a large fraction of the correlation energy at any coupling strength @xmath45 , 80% for strongly deformed systems and even more for weakly deformed ones .",
    "this makes it obvious that variation - after - projection is the superior strategy .",
    "mind that topgoa helps to simplify variation - after - projection considerably .",
    "we will test it now in the next paragraph .",
    "the performance of topgoa for rotational projection is checked in figure [ fig : comp_prjrot ] for the case of @xmath74=12 .",
    "conventional goa has obviously problems at small deformation up to beyond the critical point .",
    "but topgoa provides a very good approximation to exact projection throughout .",
    "and it does that on the grounds of a simple expression for the projected energy which can be deduced from second order moments only .",
    "this is welcome for an efficient variation - after - projection and it is particularly helpful in connection with effective energy functionals because double ( anti-)commutators with @xmath81 can still be safely derived from second functional derivatives , see sec .",
    "iv e.    the rotational projection can still be done with second order information around the minimum point .",
    "it is thus as simple to compute as rpa . and",
    "this simple part provides the dominant portion of the correlation energy .",
    "the most costly part of the correlation energy is computing the small final contribution from vibrations .",
    "it is tempting to consider mere angular projection as a first guess for the correlation energy . that is , in fact , a strategy pursued in the large scale fits of @xcite .",
    "our result here provides a welcome substantiation of their `` rule of thumb '' .",
    "the conclusions from the previous subsection encourage the quest for a more efficient estimator of the vibrational correlation energy . and the typical pattern of variation - after - projection add reasons to that .",
    "we have seen in figure [ fig : demo_vap ] that the variation - after - projection ground state is nearly always deformed .",
    "the projected energy as function of @xmath47 has always a fairly well developed minimum much in contrast to the hf energy which is rather soft around the critical point .",
    "this hints that one is allowed to perform a small amplitude expansion about the projected minimum @xmath79 .",
    "once having accepted this idea ,",
    "the remaining steps are obvious and simple :    1 .",
    "one performs variation - after - projection using topgoa for rotational projection .",
    "this yields the variation - after - projection ground state deformation @xmath82 .",
    "2 .   one computes the topgoa projected energy @xmath83 in the vicinity of @xmath82 and deduces the curvature @xmath84 of this effective potential .",
    "3 .   for the remaining vibrational correction , one applies the simple correlation energy from harmonic approximation + @xmath85 4 .",
    "the total energy is then finally @xmath86    note that this scheme requires only information on second order derivatives in @xmath47 and @xmath48 about the deformed ground state . in that sense",
    "it is much similar to rpa .",
    "we thus call that scheme topologically corrected rpa ( toprpa ) .",
    "the essence is , of course , that topological constraints are exploited to construct from the given second order information the final ground state energy in toprpa .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_toprpa ] compares the performance of toprpa and topgoa for the correlation energy in the three - level model .",
    "it is obvious that toprpa provides a good approximation to topgoa , equally good for all system sizes .",
    "both schemes constitute a reliable approach to the exact result , better for larger systems . for completeness",
    ", we show also the correlation from angular momentum projection alone .",
    "we see again that this exhausts the leading part of correlations and could be considered as quick and simple approach",
    ". however , toprpa is not much more expensive and comes close to the final result .",
    "the second test cases in this paper is concerned with particle - number projection .",
    "it becomes necessary when starting hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states , or its bcs approximation , are involved .",
    "the hfb approximation produces independent quasi - particle states which have mixed particle number @xmath74 .",
    "one needs to project the hfb states onto good particle number .",
    "this is important in any nuclear structure calculation because doubly magic nuclei ( where mere hf suffices ) are an extremely rare species .",
    "similar as in the previous example of rotations - vibrations there is , in principle , a pair of modes , namely particle number projection and pairing vibrations .",
    "we confine here the discussion to projection alone because that is the widely used strategy and because it will again exhaust the dominant part of the correlations .",
    "let @xmath7 be a hfb state with average particle number @xmath87 the projected state with exact particle number @xmath88 is    @xmath89    where @xmath90    the construction of the path from straightforward @xmath91 makes the norm overlap a function of the difference alone , i.e. @xmath92 . the number conservation @xmath93=0 $ ] causes also @xmath94 .",

    "once having the pair @xmath112 , one can easily compute the correlation energy ( [ eq : rpacorr ] ) .        for further testing of the approximate scheme , we need a schematic model .",
    "it should have a gap in the single - particle spectrum to model the interplay between this gap and the pairing strength .",
    "thus we take a two - shell model with lower band @xmath113 and upper band @xmath114 .",
    "each band is @xmath74-fold degenerated as @xmath115 .",
    "the states @xmath116 are considered as the pairing conjugate partners .",
    "this yields the generalized lipkin - meshkov - glick model introduced in ref .",
    "it is simply a two - level model with seniority pairing .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath117 we associate the following single - particle energies and occupation amplitudes @xmath118 note that the fermi energy is @xmath119 for symmetry reasons .",
    "the exact solution can be obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : lmg2_ham ] ) using the quasi - spin formalism , for details see @xcite .",
    "the model is sufficiently simple that everything can be worked out analytically .",
    "the final result projected energy in topgoa becomes    @xmath120    \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this energy needs now to be compared with the bcs approximation @xmath121 , the rpa energy , and the exact energy .      as shown in @xcite , there are two collective modes in this model . for small values of @xmath45 , the mean field approximation does not support the bcs solution and only the trivial solution with zero pairing gap @xmath122 appears . in this regime ,",
    "the two rpa frequencies are similar to each other , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit expressions . at @xmath123 ,",
    "the system undergoes phase transition to the superfluid phase , and the number fluctuating bcs solution becomes the ground state in the mean field approximation .",
    "consequently , one of the rpa frequencies becomes zero due to the number conservation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : lmg2_ham ] ) .",
    "applying eq.([eq : rpacorr ] ) with the symmetry mode yields the the rpa correlation energy @xmath124 the rpa frequency of the other mode is given by 2@xmath125 .",
    "this mode corresponds to the pairing vibration whose contribution is omitted here because we study just the projection part .",
    "full projection is often difficult , the more so if used in connection with variation - after - projection .",
    "thus one often employs approximate schemes for particle - number projection .",
    "a widely used approximation scheme for particle - number projection is the lipkin - nogami approach , see e.g. @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "it provides a good numerical approximation of the variation - after - projection in situations where both the hfb equations predict a collapse of the pairing correlations .",
    "the prescription of lipkin - nogami amounts to modify the energy by adding the second - order kamlah correction @xmath126 where @xmath127 is computed from mixed variances of @xmath12 and @xmath81 , see e.g. for skyrme - hartree - fock @xcite .",
    "the modification of the hfb equations associated with the lipkin - nogami prescription is obtained by a restricted variation of where @xmath127 is not varied although its value is calculated from self - consistent expectation values . for a thorough discussion of the approximations involved",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that the kamlah expansion , and therefore the lipkin - nogami approach , uses the similar expansion as the naive goa and does not take into account the topology of the gauge angle @xmath128 .",
    "the upper part of figure [ fig : pnp_n12 ] shows the total energy in the two - level model with seniority pairing for @xmath74=12 particles .",
    "various approximations are considered .",
    "the bcs is the uncorrelated result .",
    "it decreases with constant slope up to @xmath129 which is the transition point from pure hf ( for smaller @xmath45 ) to a truly pairing hfb state ( for larger @xmath45 ) .",
    "the exact energy is the goal .",
    "in addition to rpa and topgoa , we show also the results from the lipkin - nogami scheme ( see section [ sec : ln ] ) .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that all corrections improve the bcs energy towards the exact result .",
    "the rpa correction works fine except for the region around the critical point .",
    "that is understandable because the critical point is distinguished by large fluctuations and rpa is designed to be a theory for small amplitude .",
    "the lipkin - nogami result has a smoother trend than rpa and correct the energy in the wanted direction .",
    "however the correction is incomplete , particularly at small coupling @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the topgoa provides a very good approximation throughout all coupling strengths .",
    "it is clearly superior to the competing projection approach , the lipkin - nogami scheme , and it is more robust than rpa around the transition point .    a more detailed comparison of the various approaches is shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig : pnp_n12 ] .",
    "it displays the correlation energies which point out the differences more clearly .",
    "first of all , the correlation energy stays about independent of system size while the total energy grows @xmath130 .",
    "this means that the relative importance of correlations shrinks as @xmath131 .",
    "this corroborates the known effect that mean field models , here represented by bcs , become exact in the limit @xmath132 .",
    "the lipkin - nogami scheme maintains its feature to produce a `` half - way '' correction .",
    "it is a little bit surprising that the mismatch becomes even more pronounced with increasing system size .",
    "the rpa , on the other hand , clearly improves for larger systems .",
    "that is not surprising because mean field theories are restored in the large @xmath74 limit , and rpa is a theory of vibrating mean fields .",
    "finally , the topgoa provides a reliable and robust approximation to the exact correlation energy at all system sizes and coupling strengths .",
    "there are regions where it is near to perfect .",
    "there are regions where one obtains visible deviations of a few percent .",
    "but the trends are always smooth and the average performance is excellent .",
    "there are two more particularly appealing aspect of particle - number projection with topgoa :    1 .",
    "the project energy ( [ eq : pnptop ] ) is a closed expression in terms of expectation values of @xmath81 in combination with @xmath12 and of the occupation amplitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "one can easily use that as starting point for `` variation after projection '' .",
    "variation with respect to the single particle wave functions yields the appropriate correction terms to the mean field equations .",
    "these terms can easily be incorporated in existing codes .",
    "the full gcm is not applicable in connection with nuclear density functionals , as e.g. the skyrme - hartree - fock energy .",
    "the energy - density functional is given for an expectation value with one mean field state .",
    "the extension to overlaps with different states at @xmath21 and @xmath23 is ambiguous .",
    "but an extension of the functional is still feasible in the immediate vicinity of a mean field state .",
    "thus the second order expression @xmath133 in ( [ eq : h2pnp ] ) can still be derived within the safe grounds of density - functional theory .",
    "the topgoa thus provides a means to compute particle number projection safely for skyrme - hartree - fock .",
    "we have investigated the efficient computation of ground state correlations for low - energy modes and projection .",
    "starting point is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "it is considered in the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) which reduces the formal and numerical expense dramatically because it involves only expectation values and second order variations therefrom .",
    "we have shown that goa runs into troubles in cases of weak coupling ( thus broad overlaps ) for coordinates with non - trivial topology .",
    "a slight modification of the scheme allows to tune a topologically correct goa ( topgoa ) .",
    "we have demonstrated and tested topgoa for two typical cases of collective coordinates , rotation - vibration and particle - number projection . to that end , we employed exactly solvable models in the spirit of the lipkin - meskov - glick model .",
    "the straightforward cases are mere projection ( test cases : angular momentum and particle number ) .",
    "it was found that topgoa provides an excellent approximation to full projection . performing variation after projection ( variation - after - projection ) allows to incorporate already a great deal of correlations into the projected states .",
    "the topgoa is particularly well suited for variation - after - projection because the projected energy is expressed in simple and compact expressions on which one can perform variation with moderate expense , far simpler than for exact projection ( where non - orthogonal overlaps complicate matters ) .",
    "in particular for particle number projection , topgoa thus offers a simple and in all regimes reliable scheme which allows a thoroughly variational formulation .",
    "it is superior to the lipkin - nogami scheme in that respect .",
    "mere angular momentum projection with variation - after - projection was shown to grab a large portion of the correlation energy .",
    "yet it is incomplete without the vibrational part .",
    "we have tested topgoa for the coupled rotations - vibrations and it performs well in all regimes , near sphericity , at the transition point , and for well deformed nuclei . as one could expect for a gaussian limit , the performance improves with system size .",
    "the reverse is also true : small systems are more critical and a two - particle system is off limits .",
    "the topgoa for vibrations involves , in principle , large amplitude motion .",
    "this can become inconvenient in practice because a whole collective deformation path has to be mapped .",
    "the better defined deformation of the variation - after - projection ground state allowed a small amplitude expansion of topgoa .",
    "the result is a scheme which can live with second order expression around the projected ground state .",
    "we consider it as a topological generalization of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which also deals with second order expressions throughout and call this new scheme topological rpa ( toprpa ) .",
    "we find that toprpa provides a good approximation to the results of topgoa and thus to the exact correlation energy for rotations - vibrations .",
    "altogether , we have developed with the help of topologically corrected gaussian overlaps a palette of useful approximations for computing very efficiently collective correlations on top of nuclear mean - field calculations .",
    "the next step is to implement that into practical calculations .",
    "work in that direction is in progress .",
