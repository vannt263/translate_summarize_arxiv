    "less than a decade ago berger @xcite and slonczewski @xcite argued that an electric current sent through multilayers of normal metals ( n ) and ferromagnets ( f ) can excite the ferromagnetic order parameter and even reverse the magnetization .",
    "the theoretical predictions have been confirmed by many experiments on f@xmath0n@xmath0f nanostructured spin valves.@xcite the physics of collective ferromagnetic excitations driven by out - of - equilibrium quasi - particles is complex and fascinating . in magnetic memories",
    "current - induced magnetization switching might turn out to be superior to its magnetic field driven counterpart .",
    "current - induced magnetic excitations are driven by the spin transfer torque acting on the magnetic order parameter when a spin current polarized normal to the magnetization is absorbed by the ferromagnet.@xcite the transverse spin current extinction is a quantum mechanical dephasing effect between electrons at the fermi energy with different precession lengths . in co , ni and fe this happens on an atomistic length scale.@xcite by conservation of angular momentum the absorbed spin current acts as a torque on the ferromagnetic condensate . at a critical spin current ,",
    "this torque becomes strong enough to set the magnetization into motion , possibly leading to a complete reversal of the magnetization direction .",
    "one discussion that started with the prediction of the current - induced magnetization dynamics remains to be settled .",
    "berger defines the critical current at the onset of spin wave excitations , whereas slonczewski considers a rigid coherent rotation of the whole magnet (  macrospin model ) . in the latter scenario",
    ", the critical current corresponds to a torque that just overcomes the gilbert damping . in our view , the differences in these pictures are to some extent semantic , since the macrospin model is identical to the lowest energy spin wave .",
    "the physical question addressed here is the wavelength of the spin wave that is most easily excited .",
    "we find that there is no universal answer and that the preferential excitation mode is a complicated function of device parameters and current direction",
    ". nevertheless , our theory agrees well with experiments that observe both type of excitations.@xcite    most theories of spin transfer torques and critical currents are based on macrospin precessions in spin valves.@xcite indeed , sufficiently small magnetic clusters support a single domain magnetization and the magnetic field induced magnetization reversal is well described by a coherent rotation according to the stoner - wohlfarth model.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the macrospin models validity is essential for understanding the non - linear physics underlying the entire magnetization dynamics by dynamical systems theory and the probabilistic treatment in the `` presence '' of noise.@xcite in a single ferromagnetic film sandwiched by normal layers , the torque on the macrospin domain necessarily vanishes .",
    "however , biased n@xmath0f@xmath0n structures are unstable with respect to spin waves with shorter wavelengths.@xcite in spin valves , we may therefore expect a competition between macrospin and shorter wave length spin waves excitations .",
    "experiments on spin valves @xcite have indeed been interpreted in terms of both types of excitations , depending on the current direction ( and the spin accumulation pattern ) .",
    "it is our purpose to understand and model these data in order to assess the dependence of the excitation modes on device parameters .",
    "another motivation to study the competition between different excitation modes is the need to find criteria for the breakdown of simple models for the magnetization that provide a guide for the necessity of full - fledged micromagnetic calculations.@xcite    our work extends refs .   on single layers to spin valves .",
    "we derive analytical expressions for bias - driven spin transfer torques , enhanced gilbert damping constants @xcite and critical currents for magnetic excitations as a function of wave vector .",
    "we predict a rich `` phase diagram '' in the current _ vs. _ magnetic field plane .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : model ] introduces our model for the spin valve pillar .",

    "our results are presented and discussed in section  [ s : results ] . in that section , we also compare our results with the measurements by the nyu / ibm collaboration and find a semi - quantitative agreement .",

    "we also consider normal metals thinner than the spin - diffusion length .",
    "a possibly spatially dependent pillar cross section , not discussed below any further , can be treated by simply scaling the resistance parameters .",
    "we compute the spin transfer torques , the enhanced gilbert damping and the critical current for magnetic excitations in the following way . the charge and spin accumulation pattern and the charge and spin current through the system",
    "is computed by treating the n@xmath0f@xmath0n@xmath0f@xmath0n spin valve layer by layer .",
    "our calculations includes scattering due to bulk impurities within each layer _ and _ scattering due to the band - structure mismatch between adjacent metals , _",
    "e.g. _  interface resistances .",
    "both bulk impurity scattering and interface mismatch are important in _ e.g. _  understanding the giant magnetoresistance effect in magnetic multilayers .",
    "bulk impurity scattering is taken into account by solving the diffusion equations in the bulk of each material .",
    "spin and charge current through four interfaces between the normal metals and the ferromagnets are determined by the interface scattering matrix between the adjacent materials which gives rise to the interface resistances that we take into account .",
    "we will show below that our results for the spin transfer torques , the enhanced gilbert damping and the critical current for magnetic excitations can be expressed in terms of the resistance parameters of the electronic circuit in fig .",
    "[ spinvalve]b .",
    "let us first introduce the resistances that are important for the calculations and the results : starting from the left in fig .",
    "[ spinvalve]b we introduce a bulk resistance per unit area for the bulk of the left normal metal , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the resistivity of the normal metal and @xmath3 is the thickness of the normal metal layer in the transport direction .",
    "similarly , starting from the right , we introduce the bulk resistance per unit area for the bulk of the right normal metal , @xmath4 and the bulk resistance per unit area for the bulk of the middle normal metal , @xmath5 .",
    "the interesting physics arises due to the spin - dependent scattering within the bulk of the ferromagnetic layers _ and _ at the interfaces between the normal metals and the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "the spin - dependent resistances @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) in the ferromagnetic elements consist of interface and bulk contributions : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spin - dependent resistance per unit area of a single f@xmath0n interface assumed identical on both sides of film @xmath11 . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are its spin - dependent resistivity and thickness . when the magnetizations are collinear the spin dependent resistances in the ferromagnets with the resistances in the normal metals are sufficient to describe the transport of charge and spin in the systems .",
    "when the magnetizations are non - collinear , the flow of spins directed perpendicular to the magnetization in the ferromagnets must also be quantified .",
    "the mixing conductance @xmath14 determines the absorption of spins transverse to the magnetization direction and consequently the spin transfer torque.@xcite we find it convenient to introduce a mixing resistance @xmath15 so that all our results can be presented in terms of resistances .",
    "the charge and spin currents are not only induced by the applied bias , but also by spin pumping due to a moving magnetization that opposes the magnetization dynamics.@xcite effectively , when a layer magnetization precesses , it acts as a source of a spin current transverse to the magnetization direction and proportional to the precessional frequency , which should be included in the self - consistent computation for the charge and spin currents in magnetoelectronic circuits . when spin - waves are excited in one of the layers , the sources of spins are non - uniform .",
    "this leads to a wave - vector dependence of the enhanced gilbert damping .",
    "these contributions can be computed by using the same equivalent circuit , fig .",
    "[ spinvalve]b , as for the bias voltage induced charge and spin current and also depend on the same resistance parameters of the circuit .",
    "the wave - vector dependent enhanced gilbert damping turns out to be governed by the magnitude of the spin - pumping current out of the ferromagnet and the resistance between the ferromagnet and either the voltage reservoirs or other spin sinks for the emitted spin current .",
    "we wish to compute the critical currents for the magnetic instabilities in driven spin - valve pillars by linearizing the equations that govern and the magnetization dynamics close to the equilibrium configurations . in this way",
    ", we can find the critical currents for magnetic excitations , but we can not unambiguously predict what happens when the current is increased beyond the critical current . to the latter end , one needs to go beyond the linear instability regime and study the full micromagnetic behavior of each individual ferromagnet as well as the transport of spin and charge self - consistently .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we would like to emphasize that even in the linear regime the dynamics of the ferromagnets and the transport of spin and charge have to be treated self - consistently .",
    "it is the self - consistent feedback of the spin - flow from a non - uniform domain back into the ferromagnet that destabilizes the monodomain configuration in a the single layer ferromagnet.@xcite    we are mostly interested in spin - valves that have a relatively large in - plane magnetic field along the magnetization direction as _",
    "e.g. _ studied by the nyu / ibm collaboration .",
    "therefore , we proceed from equilibrium configurations of monodomain magnetizations in parallel or anti - parallel to each other . out of equilibrium , spin waves can be excited transverse or parallel to the transport direction . for sufficiently thin ferromagnets , the critical current for the transverse excitations",
    "are lower than the critical current for longitudinal excitations.@xcite consequently , we consider small transverse instabilities of the magnetization direction in fourier space , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a two dimensional vector in fourier space transverse to the transport direction and compute the perturbed charge and spin current through the system .",
    "the perturbed spin currents induce spin transfer torques on the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "also , a precessing ferromagnet emits spin current into the adjacent materials than can enhance the gilbert damping .",
    "we compute whether the magnetic instabilities are stable or unstable and find the critical current for magnetic excitations .",
    "longitudinal magnetic excitations along the transport direction ( as studied _",

    "[ alpha ] for the thin ferromagnet 1 and the thick ferromagnet 2 for the parallel configuration .",
    "for positive currents , experiments find switching of the thin ferromagnet presumably to an antiparallel configuration when @xmath226  am@xmath217t@xmath223 ( ref . ) .",
    "this value is extracted from the line in their contour plot of @xmath227 showing the onset of magnetic excitations .",
    "indeed , for positive currents macrospin excitations occur first with lowest critical current that agrees well with experiments . furthermore , we expect spin - wave excitations for the thick ferromagnet 2 at opposite currents , again in good agreement with experiments.@xcite additionally ( but not shown here ) we predict that after the thin ferromagnet 1 switches , ferromagnet 2 also becomes unstable against spin - wave excitations for positive currents , supported by experiments as well",
    ".    residual quantitative discrepancies between experiments and theory are believed to be caused by uncertainties in the material and devices parameter and details in the micromagnetic structure .",
    "we have used measurements for _ e.g. _  the bulk resistivities from the msu group and it is likely that due to a different sample preparation technique , the nyu / ibm samples have different resistivities . furthermore",
    ", the thickest ferromagnet is 12 nm in the ny / ibm measurements , which is at the boundary where spin - wave excitations along the transport direction become of importance in this layer , which reduces the accuracy of the predicted value of the critical current in the thick layer.@xcite given these uncertainties , we consider the semi - quantitative agreement encouraging .",
    "in conclusion , we report a theory of macrospin _ vs. _ spin - wave excitations in spin valves that explains recent observations using only independently determined material and device parameters .",
    "the rich phase space of magnetic excitations is classified in terms of macrospin and finite wavelength spin - wave excitations that depend on the resistance distribution in the magnetically active region . for symmetric junctions ,",
    "macrospin instabilities are strongly favored .",
    "finite wavelength spin - wave excitations are pronounced in asymmetric spin - valves with relatively high normal metal resistances comparable to that of the ferromagnets",
    ". since the results are in agreement with recent experiments , we are confident that our insights should be helpful to explore the magnetization dynamics in the full parameter space spanned by currents , external magnetic fields , and device design .",
