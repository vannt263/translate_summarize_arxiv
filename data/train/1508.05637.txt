    "it is an idea of introducing the running cosmological term @xcite . the most popular way of introducing a dynamical form of the cosmological term is a parametrization by the scalar field , i.e. @xmath15 or the ricci scalar , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ricci scalar . in the both mentioned cases ,",
    "the covariance of field equation is not violated and @xmath18 relation emerges from covariant theories i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "for example in paper @xcite , the relation @xmath20 is emerging from the theory of the scalar field with the self - interacting potential @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting that this type of a @xmath1 relation is supported by the non - critical string theory consideration @xcite .",

    "of course the conception of dark matter is also needed for the consistency of the model of cosmological structures but the hypothesis of dark energy and dark matter should be tested not as a isolated hypothesis .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the @xmath1cdm model with @xmath4 , where @xmath21 is the cosmological time for which we know an exact solution @xcite .",
    "this enables us to show the nontrivial interactions between the sectors of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "it would be demonstrated that the model , which is under consideration , constitutes the special case of models with the interaction @xcite term @xmath22 .",
    "we will be demonstrated that the time dependence of the @xmath0 term is responsible for the modification of the standard scaling law of dark matter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the scale factor @xcite .",
