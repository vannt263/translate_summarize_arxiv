    "there has long been a fruitful interplay between condensed matter physics and field theory in particle physics , many concepts that were first developed in the former later being applied to the latter and vice versa .",
    "the quantum hall effect @xcite has attracted the interest of many high energy theorists , not least because the fractional qhe exhibits collective excitations which mimic a fractional electric charge , but also because there are deeper connections between the hall effect and string theory @xcite .",
    "recently zhang and hu proposed a higher dimensional analogue of the quantum hall effect , on @xmath0 @xcite , based on haldane s description of the hall effect on @xmath1 with a magnetic monopole at the centre , @xcite .",
    "zhang and hu s idea was developed further in @xcite and extended to complex projective spaces in @xcite .",
    "the connection between the higher dimensional quantum hall effect and string theory was analysed in @xcite .",
    "the higher dimensional quantum hall effect involves a generalisation of the landau problem to particles moving on a compact coset space @xmath2 , in the presence of a background gauge field : such as a @xmath3 monopole on @xmath4 or a homogeneous @xmath5 instanton field on @xmath0 .",
    "a common ingredient of the these analyses is the calculation of the degeneracy of the ground state for particles moving in a homogeneous background , i.e.  a background field which has the symmetry of the isometry group @xmath6 . in previous works , and in this paper also",
    ", the gauge group will be restricted to be the holonomy group @xmath7 ( or a factor group of same if @xmath7 is a product of smaller groups ) .    in @xcite the degeneracy of the ground state",
    "was calculated using group theory : the non - relativistic hamiltonian for a spinless particle moving in a homogeneous background field involves the quadratic casimirs of the groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the allowed states involve irreducible representations of @xmath6 that contain pre - ordained representations of @xmath7 .",
    "the dimension of the representation of @xmath6 corresponding to the ground state is identified with the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "it is common in discussions of the quantum hall effect to ignore the electron s spin .",
    "zhang and hu treated scalar particles satisfying the exclusion principle , as did karabali and nair : this is perfectly justified when the zeeman splitting is large enough that transitions between spin states can be ignored and the ground state is effectively isolated from the next highest spin state .",
    "nevertheless one is tempted to ask what is the rle of electron spin in the higher dimensional quantum hall effect , and it will be argued here that there is an important quantitative relic of the fermionic nature of the particles in the degeneracy of the ground state , over and above the trivial consequences of the exclusion principle .",
    "it is shown in section 2 that the degeneracies calculated in @xcite , for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 respectively , are related to the index of the dirac operator for fermions moving in the appropriate background field : in fact the degeneracy is the number of zero - modes of the dirac operator and , generically , this is the modulus of the index .",
    "furthermore the ground state wave - functions , the higher dimensional analogues of the laughlin wave - functions , are precisely the zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "we do not have to look far to discover the reason for this  the square of the dirac operator is nothing other than the hamiltonian for a non - relativistic fermion moving in a static background field , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ricci scalar and the last term represents the zeeman splitting .",
    "( there is an extra term on the right hand side of ( [ nrh ] ) if the spin connection involves torsion , this equation must therefore be modified for non - symmetric coset spaces with torsion as considered in section 3 . )",
    "thus a non - relativistic particle moving in a static background magnetic field is an example of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a self - dual pre - potential @xcite . since the dirac operator is hermitian , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ nrh ] ) are positive semi - definite and a zero - mode requires exact cancellation of all three terms on the right hand side .",
    "it is shown in sections 2 and 3 that , for specific homogeneous background fields ( analogues of monopole and instanton fields on @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) all three terms on the right hand side of ( [ nrh ] ) are mutually commuting and so can be simultaneously diagonalised so that all spin components decouple from each other .",
    "the dirac laplacian @xmath10 is itself a positive operator on a compact space with positive curvature , so a zero - mode of the dirac operator , if one exists , requires a cancellation of the lowest eigenvalue of the laplacian with the lowest eigenvalue of the sum of curvature and zeeman terms on the right hand side of ( [ nrh ] ) .",
    "in fact , for the homogeneous background fields that are considered here , the eigenvalues of ( [ nrh ] ) can be determined purely in terms of certain quadratic casimirs of the isometry group @xmath6 and the holonomy group @xmath7 and are given by equation ( [ eigenvalues ] ) or , more generally , ( [ torsioneigenvalues ] ) .    even without calculating the full spectrum it is possible to find the representation of @xmath6 with the lowest eigenvalue for any fermion in a given representation of the gauge group . if the chosen representation of the gauge group allows for a zero - mode of the dirac operator then the dimension of the representation corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue generically gives the number of zero - modes . since",
    "this calculation involves only the lowest eigenvalue of the zeeman and the curvature terms , which are fixed in advance , the fermionic nature of the particles can be ignored and the problem reduces to choosing the correct representations of @xmath6 to scan in minimising the laplacian .",
    "this is precisely what was done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the net result is that the number of zero - modes of the dirac operator , for fermions in a given representation of the gauge group , can be calculated simply from a knowledge of the quadratic casimirs of @xmath6 and the decompositions of its representations under @xmath11 .",
    "this generalises the results of @xcite and @xcite to the quantum hall effect on any coset space @xmath2 with compact lie groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "of course an analysis of the spectrum of the dirac operator is of intrinsic interest , even without reference to the quantum hall effect . in particular",
    "it is of obvious importance in kaluza - klein theories and and string theory .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "the case of symmetric spaces @xmath2 is treated in detail and it is shown how the eigenvalues of the dirac operator in the presence of a homogeneous background gauge field can be expressed in terms of quadratic casimirs @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the examples of @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath14 are worked out and compared to known results .",
    "section 3 extends the analysis to non - symmetric spaces with torsion and the example of @xmath15 is treated in detail  this space is of interest in string theory where it is arises in the context of seven dimensional spaces with @xmath16 holonomy and their conical singularities @xcite .",
    "section 4 gives a summary of the results .",
    "some technical details are relegated to three appendices : appendix a reviews aspects of the geometry of homogeneous spaces used in the text .",
    "appendix b presents the spectrum of the dirac operator on @xmath14 , in the presence of a homogeneous background @xmath17 gauge field .",
    "appendix c presents a standard analysis of the atiyah - singer index theorem on @xmath15 for comparison with the results of section 3 .",
    "consider the dirac operator for a fermion moving on a @xmath18-dimensional compact space , without boundary , in the presence of a background gauge field : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin connection , @xmath21 the gauge connection and @xmath22 are generators of the gauge group ( @xmath23 are orthonormal indices and @xmath24 is a co - ordinate index ) .",

    "gives @xmath29 with @xmath30 the dirac laplacian .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath31 as the kinetic energy and @xmath32 as the zeeman energy .",
    "the laplacian here is the laplacian acting on spinors , including the spin and the gauge connection , so its spectrum depends on both the metric and the background field .    on a coset space @xmath2 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 compact groups , it is natural to use the @xmath6-invariant metric , for which the generators of @xmath6 are killing vectors and the holonomy group is @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore we shall consider background gauge fields which are compatible with the isometries , in the sense that lie transport of the field strength @xmath34 by a killing vector @xmath35 generates a gauge transformation , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , the group of gauge transformations .",
    "in particular this will be the case if we identify the gauge group with the holonomy group and the gauge connection with the spin connection  the details of this identification are given in appendix a. ( a variation on this is if the holonomy group factorises into simple groups and @xmath3 factors .",
    "when this is the case the gauge group can be taken to be one of the factors .",
    "for example this is the situation for the homogeneous @xmath5 instanton on @xmath0 , where @xmath38 and , at the level of the algebras , @xmath39 so we can take the gauge group to be just @xmath5 . )    let @xmath40 be the generators of the isometry group @xmath6 , with @xmath41=i{f_{ab}}^c t_c$ ] , and @xmath22 the generators of the holonomy group @xmath7 .",
    "then the curvature 2-forms of the @xmath6-invariant metric for a symmetric space are ( see appendix a ) , @xmath42 identifying the gauge connection with the spin connection gives rise to the field strength , @xmath43 for a symmetric space the riemann tensor is co - variantly constant and this means that the above field strength is co - variantly constant , @xmath44 in particular the laplacian commutes with the zeeman term in the hamiltonian .    with this choice of background field the commutator ( [ fr ] ) simplifies , @xmath28=i{f^i}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left\\{\\bigl({\\bf 1}\\otimes t_i\\bigr ) -   { i\\over 4}f_{i\\gamma\\delta}\\bigl(\\gamma^{\\gamma\\delta}\\otimes{\\bf 1}\\bigr)\\right\\}.\\ ] ]",
    "now @xmath45 are a representation of the gauge group ( which may be reducible , in general ) , @xmath46=i{f_{ij}}^k t_k,\\ ] ] so @xmath28={f^i}_{\\alpha\\beta } d_i\\ ] ] with @xmath47 being the generators of @xmath7 in the tensor product representation of @xmath22 with the spinor representation @xmath48 .",
    "this allows the laplacian to be expressed as the difference of quadratic casimirs , @xmath49 for spinors in a given representation @xmath22 of the gauge group @xmath50 in this expression is always calculated in the fixed representation ( [ di ] ) , which in general involves reducible representations of @xmath6 , while the representations used in @xmath51 range over all irreducible representations of @xmath6 than contain ( [ di ] ) .",
    "in particular the cross - term @xmath52 from @xmath53 in ( [ laplacian ] ) exactly cancels the zeeman energy in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and , as described in appendix a , the second order casimir for the representation @xmath48 is related to the ricci scalar by @xmath54 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the square of the dirac operator ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can then be expressed purely in terms of quadratic casimirs : @xmath55    this construction will now be illustrated with some examples .    _",
    "i ) @xmath56 _    this was the geometry originally studied by haldane in the context of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the isometry group is generated by the algebra of @xmath5 @xmath57=i{\\epsilon_{ab}}^c t_c\\ ] ] and we are free to choose @xmath58 to generate the @xmath3 holonomy . formula ( [ curvature ] ) of appendix a gives @xmath59",
    "so @xmath60 are the curvature 2-forms for a sphere of unit radius .",
    "also @xmath61 is the field strength if a magnetic monopole at the centre of the sphere .",
    "actually this corresponds to a monopole of charge 2 , since @xmath62 is the chern class of the tangent bundle ( which is equal to the euler characteristic ) .",
    "in general we can put a monopole of any integral charge at the centre of the sphere @xmath63 ( alternatively we can work with a monopole of charge 2 and consider fermions of any half - integral charge in this background . )",
    "choosing @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 pauli matrices , we have @xmath68 the ricci scalar for a sphere of unit radius is 2 , so equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) gives @xmath69 for positive @xmath70 this indicates that there are spin down zero - modes of the dirac operator if @xmath71 while for negative @xmath70 there are spin up zero - modes if @xmath72 there are of course no zero - modes for @xmath73 as required by lichnerowicz theorem .    in this example",
    "@xmath22 of ( [ di ] ) is just a number , @xmath74 , and @xmath48 is @xmath75 so @xmath76 the eigenvalues of the laplacian ( [ laplacian ] ) are therefore @xmath77 as discussed in @xcite , so eigenvalues of ( [ s2hamiltonian ] ) are @xmath78 which can also be obtained directly from ( [ eigenvalues ] ) . for @xmath73",
    "this reproduces the well - known result that the spectrum of the dirac operator is linear in angular momentum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath79 the representations @xmath80 of @xmath5 that appear in a harmonic expansion of @xmath81 are restricted to those that contain the @xmath3 representation of charge @xmath82 , i.e.  @xmath83 with @xmath84 a non - negative integer , @xmath85 there are zero - modes for @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for positive @xmath70 or @xmath88 for negative @xmath70 . in either case",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state is @xmath89 which is the number of zero - modes of the dirac operator .",
    "note the shift of @xmath90 away from @xmath91 by @xmath92 , due to the intrinsic spin of the fermion .",
    "the degeneracy ( [ degeneracy ] ) relates to the atiyah - singer index theorem which states that the the index of the dirac operator is minus the first chern class @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of positive chirality zero - modes and @xmath95 the number of negative chirality zero - modes . indeed the ground state wave - functions in @xcite for the integer quantum hall effect , spherical analogues of the laughlin wave - functions , are precisely these zero - modes .",
    "the case @xmath96 corresponds to @xmath97 , in this case the gauge connection exactly cancels the spin connection for the relevant chirality and single zero - mode of the dirac operator is a constant spinor .",
    "the above calculation can be represented graphically using young tableaux , which will be useful in more complicated situations to follow .",
    "the fundamental of @xmath5 decomposes as @xmath98 denoting @xmath99 by @xmath100 and @xmath101 by @xmath102 the @xmath103-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath5 contains @xmath104 with @xmath105 . fixing the @xmath3 charge to be @xmath106 constrains",
    "@xmath107 so @xmath108 . the ground state energy for a fermion in this background",
    "can now be found by minimising @xmath81 , since all the other terms in the energy are constants for fixed @xmath106 , that is by minimising @xmath109 if @xmath110 this is minimised by @xmath111 , so @xmath112 and the degeneracy of the ground state is @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 it is minimised by @xmath115 and then @xmath116 , so the degeneracy is @xmath117 . in either case",
    "the ground state has @xmath118 and the degeneracy is @xmath119 .",
    "clearly @xmath120 and the @xmath3 charge @xmath106 is not just the monopole charge @xmath70 , but includes a shift to account for the intrinsic spin of the fermion , @xmath121 .",
    "this method , using representation theory to describe the kinetic energy and calculate the degeneracy of the ground state , was used in @xcite : though in that reference the particles were treated as scalars so there was no intrinsic spin  there was therefore no zeeman energy to make the total ground state energy vanish and no shift in the charge to account for the intrinsic spin of the particles .",
    "the technique is however applicable to both the laplacian for scalars and the square of the dirac operator because , for a given gauge background and representation , they only differ by constants .",
    "it has the advantage of avoiding an explicit calculation of the full eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator .    _",
    "ii ) @xmath122 _    the next example , @xmath0 , was the case studied in the first paper on the higher dimensional quantum hall effect , @xcite . in this case",

    "demanding that an @xmath125 irreducible representation contains the @xmath131 of @xmath5 implies @xcite @xmath132 and so @xmath133 the ricci scalar for the unit four - sphere is @xmath134 so the eigenvalues ( [ eigenvalues ] ) of @xmath135 for a fermion in the representation @xmath136 of the gauge group are thus    @xmath137    ( the factor of two in front of the gauge casimir @xmath138 here is due to the fact that the dirac operator is non - chiral , the holonomy group is @xmath123 , and both chiralities couple to the gauge group in the same way . )",
    "the total isospin @xmath131 is a combination of the gauge isospin @xmath136 and the intrinsic spin of the fermion , @xmath139 , so the energy levels are labelled by the integer @xmath127 and @xmath140 both with degeneracies @xmath141    the spectrum of the dirac operator on @xmath0 has already been studied in the literature . with @xmath142 , so @xmath143 , ( [ spherespectrum ] ) reduces to @xmath144 the eigenvalues of the dirac operator itself are therefore linear in @xmath127 and reproduce the result of @xcite , with @xmath145 in their notation .",

    "the degeneracy of this ground state is @xmath150 and these are precisely the degeneracies found in @xcite for the ground state of the higher dimensional quantum hall effect on @xmath0 .",
    "this can be related to the index of the dirac operator .",
    "recall that the @xmath5 instanton in the @xmath136 representation can be represented by the field strength @xmath151 and @xmath152 , @xmath22 being @xmath153-dimensional matrices ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "the index of the dirac operator for a fermion in the @xmath136-representation of the gauge group @xmath5 is then @xmath154 since the unit @xmath0 has volume @xmath155 .",
    "this agrees with the degeneracy of the ground state ( [ sfourdegeneracy ] ) if @xmath156 the representation @xmath131 again includes the intrinsic spin of the fermion : @xmath131 is in the tensor product of the @xmath136 with the @xmath92 in ( [ di ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath157 can give @xmath158 and the single zero - mode of the dirac operator for a fermion in the fundamental representation of @xmath5 is a constant spinor on @xmath0 because the gauge connection again exactly cancels the spin connection in this case .",

    "moving in a homogeneous background field identified with the natural spin connection , the kinetic term and the zeeman splitting term commute .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be diagonalised resulting in a set of uncoupled spin states , each of which can be treated independently .    if all we are interested in is zero - modes and the index theorem it is not necessary to compute the whole spectrum .",
    "if zero - modes of the dirac operator exist the ground state must be one in which the zeeman energy exactly cancels the kinetic energy and its degeneracy is the number of zero - modes . since the kinetic energy is positive - definite , this cancellation requires a minimum of the quadratic casimir corresponding to the kinetic energy .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state is then just the dimension of the representation of @xmath6 that minimises the quadratic casimir  subject to the condition that only representations of @xmath6 that contain the representations of @xmath7 relevant to the spinor dynamics are considered .",
    "generically the number of zero - modes is the same as the modulus of index of the dirac operator , so this gives a method of calculating the index just by using knowledge of the quadratic casimir .",
    "the construction is not one - to - one : there may be more than one possible representation of the gauge group giving the same number of zero - modes of dirac operator .",
    "for example on @xmath14 an @xmath5 singlet with @xmath202 has @xmath246 which is the same as for an @xmath5 doublet with @xmath195 .",
    "the complete spectrum of the dirac operator on @xmath14 is given in appendix b.    the technique also works for non - symmetric space with torsion and the example of @xmath15 has been treated in detail .    it is a pleasure to thank charles nash for useful discussions on the dirac operator and the atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "in this section we summarise the construction of homogeneous connections and curvatures on coset spaces .",
    "none of this material is new : the construction is well known to mathematician s @xcite .",
    "the development here is based on the exposition for physicists in @xcite .    on coset spaces @xmath2 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 compact lie groups and @xmath6 simple , the riemann tensor can be obtained in terms of the structure constants of @xmath6 .",
    "denote the generators of @xmath6 by @xmath40 , with the algebra @xmath57=i{f_{ab}}^ct_c.\\ ] ] the set of generators @xmath247 decomposes into generators of @xmath7 , which shall be denoted by @xmath22 , and the remaining generators , which will be labelled @xmath248 .",
    "thus @xmath249 takes on @xmath18-values where @xmath18 is the dimension of @xmath2 .",
    "the algebra of @xmath6 now splits up as @xmath250=i{f_{ij}}^kt_k\\qquad [ t_i , t_\\alpha]=i{f_{i\\alpha}}^\\beta t_\\beta \\qquad [ t_\\alpha , t_\\beta]=i{f_{\\alpha\\beta}}^\\gamma t_\\gamma+i { f_{\\alpha\\beta}}^k t_k . \\label{ghalgebra}\\ ] ] the space @xmath2 is called symmetric if @xmath251 , when this is the case the decomposition ( [ ghalgebra ] ) is invariant under @xmath252 .            on a non - symmetric space",
    "there is a second , very useful , connection that comes from introducing a torsion tensor which is identified with the non - symmetric structure constants : @xmath265 giving torsion 2-forms @xmath266 then the connection with torsion is defined via @xmath267 which leads to @xmath268 the resulting curvature 2-forms are @xmath269 giving curvature tensor @xmath270 the ricci scalar for the connection with torsion is then easily evaluated as @xmath271 which can be determined using the appropriate quadratic casimirs of @xmath7 .",
    "a particular instance of this is when @xmath7 is trivial so @xmath272 .",
    "then @xmath273 and @xmath274 , all co - variant derivatives are trivial and @xmath275 is called the parallelising torsion for @xmath6 . on a symmetric space , of course , ( [ fab ] ) and",
    "( [ fabt ] ) are identical because @xmath276 .      on a generic @xmath18-dimensional",
    "manifold the curvature 2-forms ( [ rab ] ) are @xmath279 lie algebra valued 2-forms , but on @xmath2 both ( [ fab ] ) and ( [ fabt ] ) are h valued 2-forms , where @xmath33 .",
    "this means that we can take linear combinations of ( [ fabt ] ) that lie in h without losing any information .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is semi - simple , taking the combination @xmath280 suggests defining @xmath281 and then @xmath282 are h - valued 2-forms which are equivalent to ( [ fabt ] ) ( this formula is easily adapted to the case where @xmath7 contains @xmath3 factors ) .      the calculation of the full spectrum of the dirac operator on @xmath14 proceeds as follows . for @xmath161",
    "the second order casimir and dimension are @xmath283 and @xmath284 respectively . with @xmath105 and @xmath285 , as in the text , the constraints read @xmath286 where @xmath160 is even ( odd ) for @xmath131 integral ( half - integral ) . now the spectrum depends on whether @xmath179 or @xmath180 :    @xmath287 if @xmath288 then @xmath289 : in this case let @xmath290 , so @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 , for @xmath84 a non - negative integer .",
    "if @xmath294 then @xmath295 : in this case let @xmath296 , so @xmath291 , @xmath297 and @xmath298 , for @xmath84 a non - negative integer . in either case",

    "finally the ricci scalar for @xmath14 can be evaluated from ( [ ricci ] ) and the structure constants in appendix c to be @xmath305 so , putting all this together , the eigenvalues of ( [ eigenvalues ] ) are @xmath306 while the degeneracies are @xmath307 with @xmath291 and @xmath308 an integer .",
