    "generalised ( or skewed ) unintegrated parton distributions are essential ingredients in the calculation of many high energy processes initiated by protons .",
    "examples of such processes are virtual photon compton scattering @xmath7 ; diffractive heavy photon dissociation processes , like diffractive vector particle electroproduction ( e.g.  @xmath8 ) or dijet production @xmath9 or heavy quark production @xmath10 ; double diffractive central particle production ( e.g.  higgs or dijet production , @xmath11 ) . in these examples ,",
    "the @xmath12 sign is used to indicate the presence of a rapidity gap .",
    "we use the ` symmetrized ' distributions introduced by ji @xcite@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , with support @xmath15 .",
    "they depend on the momentum fractions @xmath16 carried by the emitted and absorbed partons , see fig .  1 . since , in general , @xmath17 , we speak of skewed or _",
    "we use the term _ unintegrated _ to indicate that the transverse momenta @xmath18 of the partons have not been integrated over .",
    "the bar on @xmath19 is simply to denote that ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is the unintegrated distribution .",
    "we reserve @xmath20 for ji s distributions , which are integrated over the transverse momenta .",
    "the cross sections are calculated from these universal @xmath19 distributions using the @xmath21 factorization approach , and the explicit @xmath21 dependence allows the inclusion of the full kinematic behaviour . assuming , for the moment ,",
    "that @xmath21 has been appropriately integrated over , then , in the @xmath22 limit , the distributions reduce to the conventional diagonal quark and gluon distributions . ]",
    "@xmath23    the equations for the @xmath24 evolution of the distributions of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) are well known , but as the @xmath25 possess several arguments it is impossible to determine the starting distributions by fitting to the available sparse data .",
    "however here we show that it is possible to determine the @xmath26 dependence of the distributions from the values of the conventional integrated distributions , @xmath1 and @xmath27 , that have been determined in the global analyses of deep inelastic and related hard scattering data , assuming that @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for most practical applications indeed @xmath30 , since it is specified by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of the rapidity gap .",
    "we also assume that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "indeed if @xmath35 were greater than the starting scale @xmath36 , then the logarithmic structure of the evolution from @xmath36 to @xmath35 would be destroyed .",
    "although we can not predict the @xmath37 dependence , for small @xmath37 it is expected that the @xmath37 behaviour can be factored off as the proton form factor , see , for example , ref .",

    "the procedure to determine generalised unintegrated distributions is to carefully combine two existing results .",
    "first , it has been shown that generalised ( or skewed ) distributions are completely determined from knowledge of the conventional distributions for small @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "second , it has been found that the unintegrated distributions can be determined from the conventional ( integrated ) distributions  the key observation is that angular ordering is only necessary in the last step of the evolution @xcite .",
    "we briefly review these two results in sections  2 and 3 below . in section  4",
    "we proceed to use this information to derive a formula for the unintegrated generalised distributions .",
    "then in section  5 we use the formula to compute the typical behaviour of the unintegrated skewed gluon distribution . to gain insight",
    "we also show other predictions for the gluon . finally we give a simple phenomenological form that approximately reproduces the exact result .",
    "section  6 contains a brief conclusion .",
    "here we describe how the skewed ( or generalised ) distributions @xmath38 , with @xmath39 or @xmath40 , can be determined from the conventional parton distributions , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , for @xmath30 . for simplicity",
    "we omit the @xmath24 argument .",
    "the essential result , due to shuvaev @xcite , is @xmath43 with @xmath39 or @xmath40 , where the kernels @xmath44 are known and where , for @xmath45 reduces to the conventional distributions @xmath46 or @xmath47 . in this limit",
    "the gegenbauer moments of the generalised distributions become equal to the mellin moments of the usual parton distributions . for computational purposes , it is convenient to weaken the singularities in the integral expressions for @xmath44 by integration by parts . then , for @xmath48 , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) becomes , whereas in ref .",

    "indeed we find that the ratios of the skewed to the diagonal distributions are @xmath54 where @xmath55 are simple known functions @xcite .",
    "we outline the procedure @xcite which enables the distributions @xmath56 , unintegrated over @xmath21 , to be calculated from the conventional ( integrated ) distributions @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "we start from the dglap equation @xmath59,\\ ] ] where in the virtual contribution @xmath60 in the case of the @xmath61 splitting we have to insert a factor @xmath62 in front of @xmath63 in ( [ eq : a10 ] ) , to account for the identity of the produced gluons . the real emission term in ( [ eq : a9 ] )",
    "gives the unintegrated parton density , except that we must allow for the modification due to virtual effects .",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is at the last step of the evolution , shown in ( [ eq : a12 ] ) , that the unintegrated gluon becomes dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "we have to make an appropriate choice of the cut - off @xmath68 in ( [ eq : a11 ] ) and ( [ eq : a12 ] ) .",
    "we impose angular ordering in the last step of the evolution @xcite @xmath69 thus the maximum allowed value of the integration variable @xmath62 is @xmath70 and similarly @xmath71 in ( [ eq : a11 ] ) .",
    "in summary , the @xmath72 dependence of the unintegrated distributions @xmath56 enters at the last step , ( [ eq : a12 ] ) , of the evolution through the survival factor @xmath64 , which results from the resummation of the virtual contributions , and through the cut - off @xmath68 .",
    "to calculate the generalised ( or skewed ) _ unintegrated _ distributions @xmath73 from the conventional distributions @xmath74 , we combine the procedures outlined in sections  2 and 3 .",
    "first , we extend ( [ eq : a9 ] ) so as to describe the evolution of the skewed ( _ integrated _ ) distributions @xmath75 @xmath76.\\ ] ] the splitting functions @xmath77 are given by eq .",

    "@xcite , except that @xmath78 , which arises because @xmath79 . for the antiquark contribution we should use @xmath80 in ( [ eq : a15 ] ) ; see ( [ eq : a2 ] ) . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the virtual loop contributions corresponding , in the axial gauge , to the self - energies of the emitted and absorbed partons respectively , @xmath83 in analogy to ( [ eq : a10 ] ) .",
    "we will specify the cut - offs on the @xmath62 integrations in a moment .",
    "resumming the virtual contributions , as before , introduces the survival factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where now a square root occurs due to the factor @xmath86 in ( [ eq : a16 ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain the @xmath87 dependence of the skewed distributions , namely @xmath88\\ ] ] with @xmath89 eq .",
    "( [ eq : a17 ] ) shows the modification necessary to extend ( [ eq : a12 ] ) to skewed distributions . as in section  3 , the cut - offs in the @xmath62 integrations of ( [ eq : a17 ] ) and ( [ eq : a16 ] ) are chosen so as to respect angular ordering in the last step of the evolution .",
    "we obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 of ( [ eq : a14 ] ) . although we have assumed that the emitted and absorbed partons of fig .  1 have the same @xmath21",
    ", they have different momentum fractions , @xmath17 , and so the angular ordering gives different upper limits on the @xmath62 integration in ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , and in ( [ eq : a16 ] ) for @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to use the results of section  2 .",
    "we substitute ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) for the _ integrated _ skewed distributions @xmath92 into the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : a17 ] ) . in this way",
    "we determine the _ unintegrated _ skewed distribution @xmath73 , for @xmath30 , in terms of the conventional distributions , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "note that there is no skewed effect coming from the @xmath93 region of integration in ( [ eq : a17 ] ) . in this domain",
    "the second argument @xmath94 of the splitting function @xmath77 is very small , while the first argument @xmath95 of the integrated distribution @xmath92 becomes large . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath3 dependence is negligible .",
    "therefore we may replace the singular @xmath96 part of @xmath77 by the ( diagonal ) bfkl kernel , and use this approach even for partons which incorporate the bfkl contribution in the small @xmath52 region , just as was done in the diagonal case @xcite .",
    "recall that in ref .",
    "@xcite it was seen that the unintegrated partons calculated from pure dglap partons ( as in section  3 ) are very similar to those calculated using partons @xcite which incorporate bfkl effects .",
    "it was concluded that the imposition of the angular - ordering constraint in the last step of the evolution is more important than the bfkl effects .",
    "typical behaviour of the unintegrated generalised gluon , @xmath97 , is shown by the continuous curves in fig .  2 .",
    "the results are obtained by evaluating ( [ eq : a17 ] ) for @xmath97 , using mrst99 conventional parton distributions @xcite to first determine the integrated distributions , @xmath92 , from ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) .",
    "we show results for the most relevant case , @xmath98 , that is for @xmath99 .",
    "we take @xmath100 and 0.001 with @xmath101  gev . to illustrate the @xmath72 dependence we also consider @xmath102  gev for the choice @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast to dglap @xmath21 ordering , the angular ordering , ( [ eq : a13 ] ) , imposed on the last step of evolution , enables the unintegrated distribution @xmath97 to extend into the @xmath104 domain .",
    "however , @xmath97 decreases for large @xmath21 when @xmath105 approaches @xmath52  the lower limit of integral ( [ eq : a17 ] ) ( or ( [ eq : a12 ] ) ) .    to gain insight",
    ", we compare the results with different approximate formula for @xmath97 .",
    "the most naive possibility is to take @xmath106 this simplified distribution , which is widely used in the literature , is shown by the dot - dashed curves in fig .  2 .",
    "for not too small @xmath52 and large @xmath87 , formula ( [ eq : a22 ] ) gives a negative @xmath97 ; the reason is that the virtual term in ( [ eq : a9 ] ) starts to dominate as @xmath52 increases .",
    "this shortcoming may be avoided by developing a procedure originally implied in the work of ddt @xcite , see also @xcite . for generalised partons",
    ", this leads to the formula @xmath107_{y = x + \\xi/2}.\\ ] ] in the _ diagonal _ case @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "then the derivative @xmath110 cancels the virtual contribution in ( [ eq : a9 ] ) , and @xmath25 is positive everywhere @xcite .",
    "however for the _ skewed _ case the situation is worse .",
    "our sample curves correspond to @xmath99 for which @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ". then only half of the negative term is cancelled by the derivative @xmath113 , and even the ddt - improved formula ( [ eq : a23 ] ) may give negative @xmath25 ; see the dashed curves in fig .  2 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "note , however , the improvement of ( [ eq : a23 ] ) as compared to ( [ eq : a22 ] ) for the smaller @xmath3 values shown by fig .  2 . due to the presence of the @xmath116 survival factors in ( [ eq",
    ": a23 ] ) , the gluon distribution @xmath97 decreases for @xmath117 contrary to the behaviour of the simple derivative formula ( [ eq : a22 ] ) .",
    "this reflects the small chance for low @xmath21 partons to remain untouched in the long evolution up to @xmath72 .    in order to reproduce the behaviour of the unintegrated generalised gluon @xmath97 , for @xmath30 , in a simpler form than the full formula ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , it is useful to modify the ddt - like approximation .",
    "we retain the well - justified and important leading logarithm contribution coming from @xmath118 but tune the non - leading contributions and an additional valence quark contribution ( needed for @xmath119 ) to approximately reproduce the full result shown by the continuous curves in fig .  2 .",
    "the result is the phenomenological form @xmath120_{y = \\xi } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is defined in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) and given in @xcite .",
    "form ( [ eq : a26 ] ) gives the dotted curves in fig .  2 and is a reasonable numerical approximation to the full result .",
    "it is a rough and ready way to estimate the values of @xmath97 for the physically relevant case @xmath99 .    of course",
    ", from a formal point of view , we can add to the generalised distribution , @xmath19 of ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , any function @xmath122 with support only in the time - like erbl region , @xmath123",
    "such a contribution is not obtained from the conventional partons determined from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data .",
    "however for the processes mentioned in the introduction we only need the unintegrated skewed distributions in the space - like ( dis ) domain .",
    "we have presented a procedure which allows the unintegrated skewed parton distributions , @xmath124 , to be calculated from the conventional distributions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for @xmath30 and any @xmath52 .",
    "the key formula is ( [ eq : a17 ] ) , with ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] ) as input .",
    "a crucial advantage of using unintegrated distributions is that they enable the full kinematics of the hard subprocess to be retained , and in this way incorporate a major part of higher order qcd corrections .",
    "moreover , the unintegrated skewed distributions are based on conventional partons fitted in global analyses of dis and related data , and therefore have no uncertainties coming from the lack of knowledge of the ( non - perturbative ) initial conditions .",
    "they can therefore be used to make predictions for physical processes , including those for diffractive production listed in the introduction .",
