    "beam steering is one of the most important technologies in the modern optics due to its numerous applications in such fields as optical imaging , laser machining , and free space communication .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been explored for deflection of beams by inducing refractive index gradient @xcite .",
    "they include mechanical motion @xcite , thermal gradient @xcite , the acousto - optical interaction @xcite , and the electro - optic effect @xcite . fast beam steering in photonic crystals @xcite and phased arrays @xcite were also proposed .",
    "the direction of the light propagation can also be changed by another beam of light through interaction with matter . in particular ,",
    "a medium exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite can provide large probe - beam deflection since the refractive index changes significantly near the transparency center @xcite . among the related studies we mention the refractive index measurements by probe - beam @xcite , investigation of slow light deflection by magneto - optically controlled atomic media  @xcite , and exploring a scheme of all - optical beam steering  @xcite .",
    "yet another example is the electromagnetically induced waveguiding which uses the control field as a waveguide to confine the probe field  @xcite .",
    "however , the schemes proposed in the most of the previous studies are restricted to the linear regime",
    ". they usually result in a spread of the probe pulse because the refractive index gradient depends on both the probe frequency and the spatial coordinates .",
    "fortunately , such spread can be suppressed by the enhancement of the wave localization through the formation of solitons .",
    "large intrinsic nonlinearity in an eit - based media allows for existence of probe beam solitons with extremely weak light intensities  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , ultraslow solitons @xcite , spatial solitons @xcite , and gap solitons  @xcite at low light intensity can exist in such kind of media .",
    "in this work , we propose a scheme to achieve efficient all - optical steering of light in a resonant three - level atomic system under eit regime .",
    "the scheme is based on the phenomenon of nonlinear long - living bloch oscillations ( bos ) of gap solitons , recently reported in ref .",
    "the system at hand is a gas of @xmath0-atoms loaded in a planar waveguide created by two photonic crystals .",
    "the control field used in the system is a standing - wave laser beam that originates a linear force , as well as _ linear _ and _ nonlinear _ optical lattices ( ols ) affecting a weak probe beam .",
    "ols in such a system are flexible : their parameters can be adjusted either by changing the geometry and/or intensity of the control field , or by varying one and/or two  photon detunings .",
    "briefly , the mechanism of the steering consists of two ingredients : the spatially periodic linear force induces dynamics of the probe beam in the transverse direction , while the combined effect of the lattices controls the direction of the beam propagation introducing desirable and controllable deviations . more specifically , the linear ol provides the band structure necessary for existence of the bloch states , while the nonlinear lattice is used to control the stability properties of the bloch states necessary for existence of gap solitons at both edges of each band  @xcite . due to the enhancement of the kerr nonlinearity induced by the eit mechanism ,",
    "stable spatial gap solitons , representing the beam channels , can be formed even subject to extremely weak probe light intensity and subsequently strongly deflected without undergoing appreciable deformations and attenuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the model is introduced . in sec .",
    "iii , the nonlinear equation governing the evolution of the probe field amplitude is derived .",
    "we show that stable spatial gap solitons can exist under properly chosen parameters of the control field .",
    "we also show how one can implement an efficient all - optical steering of the gap solitons .",
    "all results in this work are obtained under a set of experimentally feasible parameters .",
    "the outcomes are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "we consider a cold gas of lifetime - broadened @xmath0-type atoms , loaded into an anti - relaxation - coated planar hollow - core photonic crystal waveguide , schematically shown in fig .",
    "( it is relevant to note that both room - temperature and ultracold atoms have been successfully loaded into hollow - core photonic crystal fibers  @xcite , and have further been used to study eit  @xcite and all - optical switching  @xcite ) . as in any @xmath0-system",
    ", the atoms can populate three states : the ground state @xmath1 , the excited state @xmath2 , and the low - energy state @xmath3 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the transitions between the states @xmath1 and @xmath3 are forbidden .",
    "-direction ) is orthogonal to the ol axis ( @xmath4-direction ) .",
    "@xmath5 is the half angle between the two input control beams and @xmath6 is the output angle of the probe beam .",
    "( b ) left panel : @xmath0-type atomic system interacting with two laser beams . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the rabi frequencies of the probe and control fields . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the two - photon and the one - photon detunings .",
    "right panel : the waveguide cross section .",
    "the dotted region denotes the core filled in with the atomic gas and limited by the bragg mirrors .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the thicknesses of the core and different materials of the bragg mirrors , respectively . ]    for the particular choice of the atomic gas and geometry of the system , we take into account the two facts .",
    "first , in order to contribute to the nonlinear polarization the matrix elements of the transition between the lower states and the excited state must be nonzero , and hence the population of the excited state must also be nonzero ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one has to explore a gas with weak atomic losses due to spontaneous emission from the excited state .",
    "a particular system having such properties is the laser - cooled alkaline earth metal atoms , such as strontium atoms  @xcite where the atomic states @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 can be chosen as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "one of the advantages of such a system is that the atoms possess a long life time even in their excited states : the life time of the state @xmath2 is about @xmath20 @xmath21s corresponding to the decay rate @xmath22 khz .",
    "therefore , in what follows we use this system for the sake of the numerical studies ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] , and  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the second fact to be taken into account is the smallest possible size of the system .",
    "our aim is to execute effective steering of light using ols . in order to make the periodicity appreciable in a finite structure",
    ", one has to require the system to have the width of at least ten lattice periods or more .",
    "hence , the desirable ol should be created by the beam with the highest possible frequency . in our case , there are only two electromagnetic waves in the system , which provide the transitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "thus we are interested in the geometry where the strong control field connects the ground @xmath1 and the excited @xmath2 states , while the probe weak wave links the states @xmath1 and @xmath3 . in the case of the strontium atoms  @xcite",
    "the wavelength of the probe laser beam is @xmath25 @xmath21 m while the length of the coupling field is @xmath26 nm . requiring the modulation of the nonlinear polarization to have at least 20 lattice periods , we conclude that the width of the waveguide should be of order of 14 @xmath21 m .",
    "now we can describe the geometry of the system at hand as shown in fig .",
    "the waveguide created by two parallel bragg mirrors is placed in the ( @xmath27)-plane . a strong control field consisting of a superposition of counter - propagating waves with the frequency @xmath28 and the wavevectors @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , couples the excited state @xmath2 and the ground state @xmath1 .",
    "the excited state @xmath2 is also coupled to the low energy state @xmath3 by a weak probe field of the frequency @xmath31 and the wavevector @xmath32 ( i. e. it propagates along @xmath33-axis ) .",
    "we consider a planar waveguide with the transverse ( i.e. along @xmath34-axis ) width small enough so that only one transverse mode of the probe beam needs to be considered ( see appendix  [ ap ] ) .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath35th mode designated as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the probe field can be presented in the form @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is the polarization vector and @xmath39 is the slowly varying envelope of the probe field .",
    "the frequency ( amplitude ) of the control field @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is much higher than that of the guided probe beam @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this leads to a the effective refractive index of the bragg mirrors for the control field in the claddings to be of order one ( see appendix  [ ap ] ) , allowing us neglecting its transverse distribution ( we however emphasize that this design is introduced only for the sake of simplicity ) .",
    "the control field can be presented in the form @xmath44 here , @xmath45 stands for the polarization vector , the function @xmath46 describes the slowly varying distribution of the control field in the @xmath4 direction , and @xmath47 is the complex amplitude of the control field . in experiments , the desired space dependence of @xmath46 can be achieved with the help of beam masks .    the total electric - field can be written down as @xmath48 and considered classically .",
    "large difference between the frequencies of the probe and control fields ( @xmath49 ) allows us to split the equations for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while large difference in the field amplitudes ( @xmath52 ) allows us to consider @xmath51 to be constant in the equation for the probe beam  @xcite .",
    "now the equation governing @xmath50 can be written down as follows : [ max ] ( ^2- ) e_p= p. here @xmath53 is the probe beam polarization defined by the properties of the atomic gas in the waveguide core and by the properties of the bragg mirrors in the waveguide claddings , i.e. p=    p_clad , ( y<-b , y > b ) + p_core.(-b < y < b )    following the standard procedure  @xcite @xmath54 can be determined by calculating the effective refractive index of the bragg mirrors @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ app_p ] ) : @xmath56 .      in order to compute @xmath57",
    "one introduces the bosonic field operators @xmath58 , @xmath59 of the states @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , as well as the electric dipole matrix elements @xmath62 associated with the transitions between the states @xmath63 and @xmath60 . then the polarization can be obtained as @xmath64    the steering of the light we are interested in is performed through the proper spatial and/or temporal modulations of @xmath57 . in order to link it directly to the probe field @xmath65",
    "we have to address the heisenberg equations for the operators @xmath58 describing the atomic medium .",
    "this can be done neglecting the atomic kinetic energy , what leads to the system as follows ( its derivation repeats the steps outlined say in  @xcite ) [ heisen ] & & i_1=-_1 _ 1 - 2_c^f(x)(k x)_2 , + & & i_2=(_2-i_2 ) _ 2 - 2_c f(x)(k x)_1 + & & -_p_3 , + & & i_3= -_p^_2 .",
    "[ heisen_a ] here @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are the rabi frequencies of the respective fields @xmath68 , and @xmath69 present one- and two - photon detunings , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ heisen ] ) , we keep only the dissipation of the state @xmath2 due to spontaneous emission , by adding the decay rate @xmath70 , phenomenologically .",
    "usually , the decay rates of the lower states @xmath1 and @xmath3 are much smaller than that of the exited state and can be safely neglected . for a particular choice of the atomic gas and assuming that the decay rate of the excited state is much less than the two - photon detuning ( @xmath71 ) , one may consider the loss of the atoms from the system as a small perturbation ( see also the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "since the two - photon detuning is nonzero ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , the pure dark state ( corresponding to @xmath73 ) can not exist .",
    "however , we explore the situation where the atomic system is close enough to the dark state . to this end",
    "we look for a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ heisen ] ) in the form @xmath74 , where the exponent @xmath75 is slowly varying in space and can be obtained as a root of the respective characteristic equation .",

    "is assumed to be weak in comparison with the control field , we have that @xmath83 ( @xmath84 , see eq .",
    "( [ g_1 ] ) and the related discussions ) .",
    "an important conclusion follows from eq .",

    "more specifically , we will consider the beam propagation ( i.e. distributions of @xmath89 in space ) characterized by finite deviations from the axis @xmath4 . as we have already announced in the introduction",
    ", the mentioned deviation will occur due to bos of the beam . thus if we assume that the amplitude of bos measured in units @xmath90 [ see eq .",

    "this allows us to achieve further simplification for the polarization by defining [ v ] v(k x)_1_2 + 4 ^2(k x ) .",
    "performing the expansion of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ g_0 ] ) in the taylor series with respect to @xmath89 we get : [ g_1 ] & & _ 3^ _ 2 + i. here we have neglected the @xmath93-order terms and assumed that in the domain of bos the condition @xmath94 is satisfied . notice that the requirement @xmath95 holds for in the whole space provided [ v_cond ] _",

    "we are particularly interested in the beam dynamics resulting from the interplay of diffraction and nonlinearity when the probe field passes through the atomic cloud .",

    "more specifically , it is necessary to require that @xmath101 .",
    "this last constrain can be satisfied by different means .",
    "notice that the parameter @xmath102 can be experimentally controlled by the geometry of the laser beams ( see fig .",

    "we have shown that it is possible to choose the parameters of the atomic system , say rabi frequency of the control field and photon detunings , to reduce the diffraction of the probe beam , and thus the output beam is approximately the same with the input one . in this case , the probe field distributions is nothing but a spatial gap soliton undergoing long - living bloch oscillations . due to the significant enhancement of nonlinearity , such solitons can be formed with extremely weak light intensity , below single - photon wavepacket level .",
