    "in this paper , we further investigate the properties of h - minimal surfaces in the heisenberg group with a focus on the regularity of h - minimal surfaces that satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the study of h - minimal surface was introduced in the foundational paper of garofalo and nhieu ( @xcite ) where they showed the existence of h - minimal surfaces of bounded variation that satisfied certain boundary conditions .",
    "expanding on these results , several authors extended the investigation showing different properties and constructions of h - minimal surfaces in various settings ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , n. garofalo and the author ( @xcite ) gave a characterization of @xmath2 h - minimal surfaces used to investigate an analogue of the bernstein problem in the heisenberg group .",
    "a different approach to the study of analogues of the bernstein problem was completed by cheng , hwang , malchiodi and yang in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that there is some overlap between the results in @xcite and those of @xcite and @xcite but that the techniques are independent .",
    "in particular , both @xcite and @xcite make the observation that @xmath2 h - minimal surfaces are ruled surfaces but analyze them using different tools ( in fact , @xcite uses the machinery of pseudohermitian geometry and hence many of their results apply to a larger class of carnot - carathodory spaces ) . using the machinery of @xcite , two of the authors classify properly embedded h - minimal surfaces in the heisenberg group in @xcite while @xcite gives a geometric description of the properties of embedded h - minimal surfaces which are graphs over some plane .",
    "again , the results overlap in some respects , but the techniques are independent .    with respect to the discussion in this paper , we will use the tools developed in @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the two most important theorems from @xcite are :    [ mrep ] let @xmath3 .",
    "a noncharacteristic patch of a @xmath4 surface @xmath5 of the type @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a @xmath4 function over an open domain @xmath8 in the @xmath9-plane , is an @xmath10-minimal surface if and only if for every @xmath11 , there exists a neighborhood @xmath12 of @xmath13 so that @xmath12 can be parameterized by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 thus , to specify such a patch of smooth @xmath10-minimal surface , one must specify a single curve in @xmath17 determined by a curve in the plane , @xmath18 , parameterized by arc - length , and an initial height function @xmath19 .",
    "the curve @xmath18 in the theorem is called a * seed curve * and determines almost all of the behavior of neighborhood @xmath12 . indeed , under the assumption of at least @xmath2 smoothness",
    ", we have :    [ cleanup]let @xmath20 be a @xmath2 connected , open , complete and embedded @xmath10-minimal surface .",
    "then , either @xmath21 is a vertical plane , or @xmath21 is determined by a generalized seed curve @xmath22 .",
    "a generalized seed curve is a collection of seed curves , height functions and patching data which , taken togeher , give a description of a single curve in @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , for such h - minimal surfaces , a single curve determines the entire surface .    as all h - minimal surfaces have locally finite perimeter ( i.e. they are x - caccioppoli sets ) , we turn now to the work of franchi , serra cassano and serapioni ( @xcite ) and recall the following theorem :    [ decomp ] let @xmath24 be a @xmath25-caccioppoli set , then the reduced boundary of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is @xmath25-rectifiable , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is a compact subset of a non - characteristic hypersurface @xmath31 of class @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , one has for any @xmath33 and every @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the generalized horizontal outer normal to @xmath26 in @xmath37 , @xmath38 indicates the non - characteristic plane orthogonal to the horizontal normal to @xmath31 in @xmath37 , @xmath39 is the @xmath40-dimensional hausdorff measure in @xmath17 constructed with respect to the cc distance and @xmath32 is the space of functions which are horizontally continuously differentiable , i.e. @xmath41 exist and are continuous .",
    "the reduced boundary , @xmath42 , is the set of boundary points where the unit horizontal gauss map is well - defined ( see the next section for a precise definition ) . for the discussions of this paper , it is important to note that the reduced boundary is a full measure subset of the boundary .",
    "the main point of this theorem is that h - minimal surfaces can be decomposed into a set of @xmath43-measure zero and a union of @xmath32 sets . as we will restrict ourselves to investigating graphs over the xy - plane , we remind the reader that a @xmath32 graph is @xmath0 .",
    "this , of course , leaves a gap - the pieces given by theorem [ decomp ] are @xmath0 while theorem [ cleanup ] applies only to @xmath2 surfaces .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to partially bridge the gap between the two theorems .",
    "[ c1surf ] if @xmath21 is an open @xmath0 h - minimal graph over a domain @xmath44 with no characteristic points and unit horizontal gauss map @xmath45 whose components are in @xmath46 , then the integral curves of @xmath47 are straight lines and @xmath21 can be locally parameterized by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is an integral curve of @xmath45 . moreover , if there exists @xmath51 so that @xmath52 then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in this theorem , @xmath55 is a measure of the `` horizontal thickness '' of the set @xmath56 ( see definition [ hthick ] for a precise statement ) .",
    "this theorem is shown in a series of steps .",
    "first , we show that the weak directional derivative of @xmath45 in the direction of @xmath57 is zero .",
    "this is enough to show that the integral curves of @xmath57 are lines .",
    "second , forming @xmath18 as the integral curve of @xmath45 , a geometric argument shows that @xmath58 is lipschitz .",
    "coupled with a further estimate , this shows that @xmath59 exits and is continuous . applying arguments similar to those in @xcite yields the representation given in the theorem .    combining this theorem with theorem [ decomp ] of franchi , serapioni and serra cassano yields :    [ sum ]",
    "if @xmath21 is an h - minimal graph then @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a set of @xmath43-measure zero and each @xmath62 is a compact piece of a @xmath0 h - minimal graph . for each @xmath63 ,",
    "if @xmath62 is open and its unit horizontal gauss map has components in @xmath1 then @xmath62 may be locally parameterized by equations and with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "while this theorem recovers the characterization of such h - minimal surfaces as unions of ruled surfaces in the heisenberg group , it still leaves a gap between the baseline results of franchi , serra cassano and serapioni and theorem [ mrep ] .",
    "in particular , theorem [ decomp ] allows that the @xmath0 pieces may be glued together in nonsmooth ways .",
    "we find that this can happen :    [ pwc1 ] suppose @xmath66 and @xmath67 are subsets of @xmath0 h - minimal graphs with no characteristic points , each parameterized by a single seed curve and height function , defined over closed sets @xmath68 with open interior , @xmath69 a @xmath0 curve , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath73 and @xmath74 be the respective unit horizontal gauss maps .",
    "then , @xmath75 is an h - minimal graph if and only if @xmath76 is tangent to @xmath77 almost everywhere .",
    "this provides one way in which a continuous , piecewise @xmath0 h - minimal graph is constructed .",
    "this brings forward an obvious question :    _ in standard minimal surface theory , the solutions to the minimal surface equation subject to dirichlet boundary conditions gain additional regularity from the regularity of the boundary .",
    "do h - minimal surfaces have a similar property ? _    we devote the remaining part of the paper to exploring this question .",
    "first , we examine some of the best behaved h - minimal surfaces , those that are minimal in riemannian approximators of @xmath17 as well as h - minimal .",
    "we call these * persistent minimal surfaces * and classify them :    the persistent h - minimal graphs fall into two categories :    1 .",
    "@xmath21 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "2 .   @xmath21 , given in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath81 for @xmath82    these surfaces give examples of the best possible case - they are @xmath83 spanning surfaces .",
    "second , in section 7 , we consider the question of the existence of smooth minimal spanning surfaces . for a fixed smooth",
    "closed curve , we focus on finding the @xmath0 smooth * ruled h - minimal spanning graphs * , those @xmath0 h - minimal graphs which are ruled surfaces away from the characteristic locus which satisfy the additional condition that the rules may be extended over the characteristic locus ( as straight lines ) .",
    "we note that by work in @xcite , all @xmath2 h - minimal graphs satisfy this condition .",
    "however , using techniques similar to those of theorem [ pwc1 ] , one can construct @xmath0 minimal graphs that are the union of two ruled surfaces along a common characteristic locus and do not satisfy this condition ( see section 4 , example 4 ) . for simplicity , we will ignore this type of construction .",
    "taking the characterization of h - minimal surfaces as ruled surfaces , we create a necessary condition for a smooth closed curve which is the graph over a curve in the xy - plane to be spanned by a @xmath0 ruled h - minimal graph :    * existence criteria : * _ given a closed smooth curve @xmath84 which is a graph over a curve in the xy - plane , if @xmath85 is spanned by a @xmath0 ruled h - minimal graph then there exists a monotone @xmath0 function @xmath86 with @xmath87 . _    in this statement , @xmath88 is the set of points on @xmath85 that are accessible from @xmath89 via a rule of an h - minimal surface :    @xmath90    the examples in this section show curves that satisfy the criteria and curves that exhibit an obstruction .",
    "we also discuss the genericity of these classes .",
    "finally , we show that there are many curves , @xmath85 , which do not have smooth ruled h - minimal spanning graphs .",
    "this provides an upper bound on the regularity of the solution to the plateau problem for these curves : the solution to the plateau problem can not be @xmath2 .",
    "suppose @xmath85 is a @xmath0 curve with no legendrian points which is spanned by a @xmath0 smooth ruled h - minimal graph , @xmath21 .",
    "then there exists an interval , @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 is contained in a plane .",
    "if @xmath85 is a smooth curve with no legendrian points and no portion of @xmath85 is contained in a plane then an h - minimal surface spanning @xmath85 can not be a @xmath0 ruled h - minimal surface .",
    "these different examples show that solutions to the dirichlet problem and the plateau problem may not have any specified regularity .",
    "in particular , the persistent h - minimal graphs show that some curves have @xmath83 solution to the plateau problem while the subsequent examples show instances where @xmath83 curves may not have solution to the dirichlet problem of high regularity .",
    "indeed , the last set of examples show that for certain totally non - legendrian curves , the graphical solutions to the dirichlet ( and hence the plateau ) problem are neccesarily at most @xmath0 but can not be ruled surfaces .",
    "a consequences of this is that these surfaces must have unresolvable discontinuities in their unit horizontal gauss maps .",

    "the author would also like to thank the referee for many helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "throughout this paper , we restrict our attention to the topologically three dimensional heisenberg group , @xmath17 . for convienience , we represent @xmath17 via an identification with @xmath93 . considering @xmath93 with its usual coordinates labeled as @xmath94",
    ", we define the following vector fields :    @xmath95    the vector fields @xmath96 form a basis for the lie algebra of @xmath17 at any point @xmath97 .",
    "note that , via the exponential map at the origin , we identify @xmath17 with @xmath93 using these coordinates , denoting the point @xmath98 by @xmath99 . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define a left invariant inner product on @xmath17 , @xmath100 , which makes @xmath96 an orthonormal basis at each point .",
    "notice that at each point , @xmath101 = t$ ] and hence @xmath102 is a bracket generating set for @xmath17 .",
    "we define a subbundle on @xmath17 , called the horizontal subbundle of @xmath17 , by @xmath103 the single nontrivial bracket relation yields the following multiplication law via the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula :    @xmath104    to define the carnot - carathodory metric on @xmath17 , we construct a path metric .",
    "letting @xmath105 be the set of all absolutely continuous paths in @xmath17 so that @xmath106 and @xmath107 we define :    @xmath108    note that , since @xmath100 is left invariant , so is @xmath109 .",
    "moreover , @xmath109 admits a homothety at each point @xmath97 :    @xmath110    whereby @xmath111    we denote by @xmath112 the k - dimensional spherical hausdorff measure constructed from @xmath109 .",
    "the * horizontal gradient operator * is @xmath113 hence , @xmath114 the * horizontal divergence * of a vector field @xmath115 is @xmath116    in addition to the three dimensional hausdorff measure , we recall the perimeter measure introduced independently by capogna , danielli and garofalo ( @xcite ) and franchi , gallot and wheeden ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath56 be an open subset of @xmath17 .",
    "we say that @xmath117 is of bounded variation ( i.e. @xmath118 ) if    * @xmath119 * @xmath120    we define @xmath121 analogously .",
    "we say that @xmath24 is an * x - caccioppoli set * if the characteristic function of @xmath26 , @xmath122 if it is in @xmath123 .",
    "the measure @xmath124 is called the perimeter measure and will be denoted by @xmath125 .    we recall that ( see @xcite ) if @xmath126 is a smooth surface given by @xmath127 , then @xmath125 is mutually absolutely continuous with @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , up to a choice of constant , @xmath128 is given by @xmath129    again from @xcite , we recall the definition of the generalized horizontal normal :    there exists a @xmath125 measurable section @xmath130 of @xmath131 such that @xmath132 for all @xmath133 , @xmath134 for @xmath125 a.e . @xmath135 .",
    "we next recall the definition of the reduced boundary :    let @xmath26 be an x - caccioppoli set .",
    "let @xmath136 be the open ball of radius @xmath137 and center @xmath13 .",
    "a point @xmath13 is in the * reduced boundary of e * , @xmath138 , if    1 .",
    "@xmath139 for any @xmath140 2 .",
    "@xmath141 exists 3 .",
    "@xmath142    we note that lemma 7.3 in @xcite ensures that @xmath143 has full @xmath125 measure in @xmath126 .    in this paper , we will be examining smooth graphs over the xy - plane in @xmath17 by which we mean surfaces which can be represented as @xmath127 using the coordinates described above .",
    "as shown in @xcite and @xcite , h - minimal surfaces are critical points of an area functional based on the * horizontal gauss map * of the suface @xmath127 .",
    "the horizontal gauss map is the projection of the riemannian normal of the surface to the horizontal bundle : @xmath144    we give classically inspired names to these horizontal derivatives of @xmath145 , letting @xmath146 @xmath147    in this paper , the * unit horizontal gauss map * plays a crucial role and so we define the unit horizontal gauss map by @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "notice that @xmath45 has a limited domain and is not defined at points where both @xmath13 and @xmath151 are zero .",
    "such points are called * characteristic points * and play an important role in the study of surfaces in carnot - carathodory spaces .    in this paper",
    ", we consider surfaces which are graphs over the xy - plane .",
    "in other words , the set @xmath26 in the previous theorem is given as @xmath152 thus , the hypersurface @xmath126 would be given as @xmath153 .",
    "the function @xmath154 is horizontally continuously differentiable if and only if @xmath155 is continuously differentiable .    with this notation in place ,",
    "we next review the characterization of smooth noncharacteristic area minimizing graphs by an appropriate partial differential equation via the first variation of the energy .",
    "the first variation formula has been explored in a variety of settings by a number of authors including the aforementioned paper of cheng , hwang , malchiodi and yang ( @xcite ) , danielli , garofalo and nhieu ( @xcite ) , the author ( @xcite ) , bonk and capogna ( @xcite ) , ritor and rosales ( @xcite ) . for the convienience of the reader , we recall the derivation of the equation here .",
    "first , the energy integral we use for the variational setup is :    @xmath156    where @xmath127 defines the graph in question over a domain @xmath56 and has at least two weak derivatives .",
    "second , we consider a variation in the @xmath157 direction by a function @xmath158 .",
    "then ,    @xmath159    abusing notation , we let @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "thus , differentiating with respect to @xmath162 twice and evaluating at zero , we have :    @xmath163    and    @xmath164    in the last equation , we use the convention that if @xmath165 is the vector given by coordinates @xmath166 then @xmath167 is given by @xmath168 .",
    "this convention will be used throughout the paper . note that the integrand of the second integral is nonnegative and is strictly positive if @xmath169 is not parallel to the vector @xmath170 .",
    "thus , to check if a given solution to the euler - lagrange equation is a local minimum of area ( with respect to this type of perturbation ) , one must only check it against variations in this direction .",
    "let @xmath171 , @xmath172 , be a critical point of the energy functional .",
    "then , for all test functions @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "_ proof : _ notice first that if @xmath175 is not identically zero on a set of full measure , then since the integrand is always positive , the result follows .",
    "if @xmath169 points in the same direction as @xmath170 , we now verify that for such a perturbation , @xmath176 . in this case , let @xmath177 be a function so that @xmath178 .",
    "then , @xmath179 is the gradient of the @xmath180 function @xmath181",
    "so , @xmath182    but , @xmath183    so , we have @xmath184 by theorem [ mrep ] in the introducton , we see that the integral curves of @xmath185 are straight lines ( for a more detailed dicussion of this fact , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , implies that when @xmath177 is restricted to such a straight line , we have @xmath186 and hence , @xmath187 where @xmath157 is the parameter along the integral curve .",
    "however , as @xmath181 is compactly supported in @xmath56 , @xmath177 must tend to zero towards the boundary of @xmath56 .",
    "this is a contradiction of the existence of a compactly supported normal variation @xmath181 with gradient pointing in the same direction as @xmath170 .",
    "@xmath188 .",
    "thus local minima of this area functional appear as solutions of the following partial differential equation :    @xmath189    this equation says simply that the unit horizontal gauss map is ( horizontally ) divergence free :    @xmath190 in this paper , we will also allow solutions that are only weak solutions to this equation . in section [ glue ] , we discuss a condition under which a piecewise @xmath0 graph can satisfy this equation weakly , but not strongly .    in some of the references given above , there are versions of these first and second variation equations for more generally defined surfaces .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors give these formulae for surfaces defined implicitly asa @xmath191 .",
    "we also point out that without our restriction to graphs ( and perterbations that remain graphs ) the second variation formula does not necessarily ensure that the critical points are local minima . again , see the examples in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "danielli , garofalo and nhieu introduce the notation of h - mean curvature , which is used to define h - minimal surfaces in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recall slight variations of these definitions here using the notation above .",
    "the * h - mean curvature * of @xmath21 at noncharacterstic points of @xmath21 is defined by @xmath192 if @xmath193 , then @xmath194 provided that the limit exists , finite or infinite .",
    "if the limit does not exist , the h - mean curvature is not defined at such points .",
    "this definition differs from that in @xcite by a constant .    in @xcite and @xcite a @xmath2 surface",
    "is called an h - minimal surface if @xmath10 is identically zero . in this paper",
    ", we make a slightly different definition ,    a @xmath0 graph @xmath21 over a domain @xmath44 is an * h - minimal surface * if it satisfies equation weakly .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath195 is the unit horizontal gauss map of @xmath21 , then @xmath21 satisfies @xmath196 for all @xmath197 .    in section [ glue ]",
    ", we show that @xmath2 surfaces with @xmath198 are h - minimal in this sense as well .    for completeness",
    ", we also recall some of the results of @xcite .",
    "[ seedcurve ] let @xmath21 is a @xmath2 h - minimal graph and @xmath45 is its unit horizontal gauss map .",
    "thinking of @xmath45 as a vector field on @xmath199 , any integral curve of @xmath45 is called a * seed curve * of @xmath21 .",
    "we denote a seed curve by @xmath200 , i.e. @xmath201 . if a basepoint is understood , we denote the curve by @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the integral curves of @xmath57 by @xmath202 ( or , simply @xmath203 if a basepoint is understood ) .    as mentioned in the introduction , in @xcite , n. garofalo and the author",
    "show that , for @xmath2 h - minimal surfaces , @xmath202 are straight lines in the plane and lift to horizontal lines in @xmath17 .",
    "this yields an adapted parameterization of the plane : @xmath204 we recall that this parameterization ceases to be a local diffeomorphism along the locus @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the signed curvature of the seed curve @xmath50 and is given by @xmath207    when lifted to @xmath17 , yields a parameterization of the h - minimal surface as a ruled surface .",
    "@xmath208    this is the content of theorem [ mrep ] in the introduction .",
    "moreover , we can extend this parameterization from this patch of surface to include all of the rules ( i.e. allow @xmath209 ) , which introduces characteristic points at the locus given by : @xmath210    we recall that generically , this yields two branches of the characteristic locus , one on one side of the locus @xmath211 and the second on the other side of this locus .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , section 7 , for a more detailed discussion of these features .",
    "in this section , we investigate @xmath0 h - minimal graphs .",
    "we will focus first on section of @xmath0 h - minimal graphs that do not have characteristic points . in this setting , we show that such graphs are ruled surfaces as in the @xmath2 case . at the end of the section",
    ", we will address the question of characteristic points . throughout the section",
    ", we will consider a surface defined by @xmath78 where @xmath171 is a @xmath0 function .      at",
    "first , we will assume that the function @xmath155 defining the h - minimal surface is at least @xmath2 and so the components of the unit horizontal gauss map are continuously differentiable .",
    "under this assumption , we compute the directional derivative of @xmath212 in the direction of @xmath213 ( the choice of this vector will become evident in a moment ) .    @xmath214 the last equation is true because @xmath215 and hence @xmath216 .",
    "thus , we can interpret the integral equation @xmath217 as a weak form of the equation @xmath218    in other words , if @xmath21 is an h - minimal surface , then @xmath212 is weakly constant in the @xmath57 direction ( @xmath57 and @xmath219 point in the same direction ) .",
    "we take this as a definition :    the directional derivative of @xmath212 in the direction of @xmath220 is weakly zero if @xmath217    in this case , we write @xmath221      mimicing classical arguments , we have the following result .",
    "let @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the horizontal gauss map of an h - minimal graph , @xmath21 , over a domain in @xmath224 with @xmath225 .",
    "assume that @xmath226 be an open domain with the following properties :    1 .",
    "the portion of @xmath21 over @xmath56 has no characterstic points . 2 .",
    "@xmath165 is continuous on @xmath56 ( i.e. @xmath227 ) .",
    "last , let @xmath228 be an integral curve of @xmath165 with @xmath229 and let @xmath230 . then , for @xmath231 and @xmath232 , @xmath233 for a.e . @xmath234 .",
    "_ proof : _ let @xmath235 be a continuous vector field on @xmath236 and let @xmath237 be an integral curve of @xmath235 passing through the point @xmath238 .",
    "we note that @xmath237 , as a point set , coincides with @xmath239 but is parametrized differently .",
    "we may reparametrize @xmath240 so that @xmath241 . assuming briefly that @xmath145 is a smooth function , we have @xmath242 so , @xmath243 integrating appropriately , we have , for example , that @xmath244    using standard mollification , we can smooth the function @xmath212 yielding a @xmath83 function @xmath245 .",
    "as we have restricted to a set where @xmath212 is continuous ( i.e. there are no characteristic points ) , we know that @xmath246 uniformly as @xmath247 . noting that @xmath248 , we have that @xmath249 in @xmath250 .",
    "since @xmath251 is continuous on @xmath56 we have @xmath252 in @xmath253 .",
    "thus , @xmath254 in @xmath253 .",
    "thus , by @xmath10-minimality , for @xmath197 , @xmath255 and we have @xmath256 .    next , let @xmath257 @xmath258 and @xmath259 as @xmath245 converges to @xmath212 uniformly on @xmath236 , it follows by direct calculation that @xmath260 converges to @xmath212 uniformly on @xmath236 as well .",
