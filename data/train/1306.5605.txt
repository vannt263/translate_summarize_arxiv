    "optically trapped neutral atoms are among the prime candidates for storing and processing quantum information  @xcite .",
    "this approach greatly profits from the use of microscopic dipole traps which enable the manipulation of individual neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "several technical approaches have been followed in order to obtain optical dipole traps  @xcite with a microscopic trapping volume . among these",
    "are strongly focused free - space optical traps , traps based on evanescent light fields , and plasmonically enhanced optical trapping potentials  @xcite .",
    "tightly confined light fields are known to differ considerably from simple light fields which are described correctly in the paraxial approximation .",
    "for example , when tightly focusing an initially linearly polarized laser beam , the latter acquires a longitudinal polarization component that gives rise to a complex polarization pattern in the focal region .",
    "consequently , the laser beam is not correctly described by a transversally polarized electromagnetic wave anymore .",
    "recent experiments with atoms in the motional ground state of a non - paraxial dipole trap  @xcite as well as atoms trapped in the evanescent field of an optical nanofiber  @xcite contributed to the discussion of the ground state coherence properties of atoms in tightly - confining optical potentials  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we concentrate on the theoretical description of optical potentials in a nanofiber - based trap .",
    "however , our findings have implications for other technical realizations of tightly - confining optical potentials , too .    among the diverse concepts of trapping using optical nanofiber - guided light fields  @xcite ,",
    "only the so - called two - color trap has so far been realized experimentally  @xcite and will be discussed in this work .",
    "this trap confines atoms in the fiber transverse plane by combining the attraction and repulsion of a red- and blue - detuned guided light field  @xcite .",
    "for axial confinement , the experiment of vetsch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a pair of counter - propagating red - detuned beams and a single , running - wave blue - detuned beam ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the latter light field has an elliptical polarization which leads to a vector zeeman - state - dependent light shift of the ground state of the trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed to replace the blue - detuned running wave by a rapidly moving blue - detuned standing wave field in order to create a `` compensated '' trap in which the ellipticity of the single blue - detuned field and thereby the vector light shift effect is reduced  @xcite .",
    "this proposal has then been experimentally implemented in  @xcite .",
    "both versions of the two - color trap , the basic scheme and the compensated scheme have been compared theoretically in  @xcite , in particular concerning the coherence times of ground state spin wave in trapped atomic ensembles .    here , we extend the discussion of state - dependent trapping potentials and the ground - state coherence of atoms in a two - color nanofiber - based optical potential of the type used in vetsch",

    "inspired from the physics of spin flips in magnetic traps for cold atoms , we study the influence of a magnetic offset field for atoms in the two - color nanofiber - based optical trap . using the concept of light - induced fictitious magnetic fields ,",
    "we show how an offset field allows one to modify the zeeman - state - dependent potentials and to reduce spin flip effects .",
    "in addition , for a configuration that shows a zeeman - state - dependent displacement of the trap minima , we point out the option to drive transitions between motional states of the atom in the trap using a microwave field .",
