    "the study of black hole ( bh ) solutions with a cosmological constant @xmath2 has enjoyed recently a tremendous amount of interest .",
    "the natural ground state here is the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , which , from a mathematical viewpoint , can be regarded as fundamental as the minkowski one , possessing the same number of killing vectors @xcite .",
    "therefore , finding less symmetric solutions and contrasting the situation with the minkowskian counterparts is an interesting problem in itself which ultimately may lead to a better understanding of the real world bhs .",
    "however , the main motivation for the study of bhs with ads asymptotics comes from the proposed correspondence between physical effects associated with gravitating fields propagating in ads spacetime and those of a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of ads spacetime @xcite . according to this conjecture , the ads@xmath3 bhs would offer the possibility of understanding the nonperturbative structure of some cfts in @xmath4dimensions .    restricting to a globally ads background and @xmath5 spacetime dimensions ,",
    "one remarks that the asymptotically flat myers - perry bh @xcite possesses a generalization which has been studied by various authors , starting with the work by hawking @xmath6 @xcite . however , the situation is more patchy in the presence of an ( abelian ) gauge field .",
    "the only einstein - maxwell solution which is known in closed form is the ( electrically charged , spherically symmetric ) reissner - nordstrm - ads ( rn - ads ) bh . the basic properties of its rotating generalization has been studied in @xcite by using numerical methods , for the particular case of two equal angular momenta @xmath7 , while the general solutions with @xmath8 are still unknown .",
    "however , in five spacetime dimensions the maxwell action may be supplemented by an @xmath9 chern - simons ( cs ) term .",
    "this makes no difference to static configurations but it does affect the class of stationary solutions . rather than being merely an extension of the einstein - maxwell model , the inclusion of a cs term is motivated by its presence ( with a particular coefficient @xmath10 ) in the bosonic sector of @xmath11 minimal gauged supergravity .",
    "several exact solutions of this supergravity model describing charged rotating bh solutions have been reported in the literature .",
    "of main interest here are the bh solutions found in @xcite by cveti , l and pope ( clp ) .",
    "these are the most general asymptotically ads bhs which rotate in two planes with equal - magnitude angular momenta and are free of pathologies . as such ,",
    "they possess three global charges : the mass @xmath12 , the electric charge @xmath13 and the angular momenta @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 @xmath13 , @xmath16 are subject to some constraints , such that closed timelike curves and naked singularities are avoided .",
    "the bhs in @xcite also possess an extremal limit which preserves some amount of supersymmetry @xcite ( note that these solutions present non - vanishing angular momentum ) .",
    "generalizations of these configurations with more matter fields and/or unequal angular momenta have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to answer the question on _ how general is the clp solution ? _ for example , when taking a value @xmath17 of the cs coupling constant and imposing the following assumptions : @xmath18 ads@xmath19 asymptotics ; @xmath20 two equal angular momenta ; and @xmath21 the absence of pathologies , _ do we recover the same qualitative features as in _",
    "@xcite ?",
    "although a cs term does not contribute to the einstein equations , its presence breaks the charge reversal invariance .",
    "moreover , a value @xmath22 introduces a nonlinearity at the level of the maxwell  chern - simons equations ; thus varying @xmath0 may lead to new features of the solutions . indeed , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , the asymptotically flat limit of these bhs possesses a variety of new properties when the chern - simons coupling constant is large enough ( starting above the sugra value ) .",
    "perhaps the most unusual feature there is that the bhs form sequences of radially excited solutions , that can be labeled by the node number of the magnetic gauge potential function .",
    "moreover , the solutions there exhibit non - uniqueness and one finds extremal and non - extremal bhs with the same sets of global charges and different bulk geometries .",
    "it is likely that some of the new features in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite will survive in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "thus one can predict that the clp solution ( which possesses a nodeless magnetic gauge potential function ) will fail to provide an accurate qualitative description for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "however , the situation is less clear for small enough values of the cs coupling constant .    to answer the questions above",
    ", we consider the same framework as in the clp case ( in particular the same boundary conditions at infinity ) and study emcs bhs with @xmath23 , a task which , to our knowledge , has not been yet taken in the literature .",
    "our results show that new qualitative features occur both for small and for large enough values of the cs coupling constant",
    ". then one can not safely extrapolate the features of the clp solutions to the case of a generic @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , all unusual features found in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite for asymptotically flat bhs in emcs theory survive in the presence of a negative cosmological constant . moreover , new features occur as well for a small @xmath0 .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the general framework .",
    "the squashed @xmath24 solutions of the emcs model are discussed in section 3 in conjunction with the near - horizon formalism .",
    "such configurations are of interest since in principle they could emerge as near - horizon limit of the extremal global solutions . the bh solutions are discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "several values of @xmath0 are considered there , the situation being contrasted with the @xmath1 clp case .",
    "we end with a brief conclusion and outlook in section 6 .",
    "the appendix a contains a discussion of the basic properties of the exact clp solution .",
    "the action for @xmath5 einstein - maxwell theory with negative cosmological constant @xmath25 and a chern - simons ( cs ) term is given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the curvature scalar and @xmath28 is newton s constant in five dimensions ; in the following , to simplify the relations , we consider units such that @xmath29 .",
    "also , @xmath30 is the gauge potential with the field strength tensor @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the cs coupling constant . for the value @xmath33",
    ", the action ( [ emcsac ] ) coincides with the bosonic part of @xmath11 minimal gauged supergravity .",
    "the field equations of this model consist of the einstein equations @xmath34 together the maxwell  chern - simons equations @xmath35    the general emcs rotating bhs would possess two independent angular momenta and a topology of the event horizon which is not necessarily spherical event horizon topology in a global ads@xmath19 have been constructed recently in @xcite .",
    "one expects these solutions to possess generalizations in emcs theory . ] . thus a generic ansatz would contain metric functions and gauge potentials with a nontrivial dependence on more than one coordinate",
    "however , this is a very hard numerical problem which we have not yet solved .",
    "the problem is greatly simplified by assuming that the solutions have two equal - magnitude angular momenta and an event horizon with spherical topology .",
    "this factorizes the angular dependence of the problem , leading to a cohomogeneity-1 ansatz , the resulting equations of motion forming a set of coupled nonlinear odes in terms of the radial coordinate only spinning bhs , for various models where an exact solution is missing , see @xmath36 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite @xcite ( perturbative @xmath37 solutions have been constructed as well within the same approach , see @xmath36 @xcite , @xcite ) . ] . for such solutions",
    "the isometry group of the line element is enhanced from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the time translation .",
    "an ansatz with these symmetries is built in terms of the left - invariant 1-forms @xmath41 on @xmath42 , with a line element @xmath43 and a gauge field @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 the euler angles on @xmath42 .",
    "some analytical expressions together with a partial understanding of the properties of @xmath49 emcs bhs can be achieved by considering solutions with a squashed @xmath24 geometry . in this case , the @xmath50-dependence of the problem factorizes such that the field equations reduce to a set of algebraic relations .",
    "such solutions are found by taking a particular expression of the general ansatz ( [ metrici ] ) and ( [ gauge1 ] ) with @xmath51 the resulting geometry describes a fibration of @xmath52 over the homogeneously squashed @xmath42 with symmetry group @xmath53 @xcite . in the above relations , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are six constants subject to four constraints which result from the emcs equations ( [ einstein_equation ] ) , ( [ maxwell_equation ] ) : @xmath60",
    "together with @xmath61    a simple solution of the above equations exists in two limiting cases .",
    "first , in the absence of a gauge potential ( @xmath62 ) one finds @xmath63 this solution describes the near - horizon geometry of the extremal myers - perry - ads ( mp - ads ) bhs .    for @xmath64",
    ", a simple analytic solution can be written for @xmath65 only ( @xmath66 pure em theory ) , with @xmath67 for @xmath68 , writing a solution similar to ( [ nh_emads ] ) reduces to solving a 6th - order algebraic equation , a task which is approached numerically .",
    "thus we are left with a two - parameter family of solutions , which we found convenient to parametrize in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these constants measure the radius of the round @xmath69 and the squashing of the @xmath42 part of the metric , respectively .",
    "the solutions of the algebraic system ( [ nh1])-([nh3 ] ) are expected to describe the near - horizon limit of asymptotically ads@xmath19 extremal bhs in emcs theory .",
    "thus they are of particular interest in conjunction with the _ entropy function formalism _ @xcite .",
    "for example , this formalism allows us to find the expression for some quantities of interest for the @xmath70 extremal solutions without integrating the field equations in the bulk ; it also leads to some predictions for the structure of those bhs .",
    "the analysis is standard and a detailed computation has been given in @xcite , for the same framework , although in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "thus we shall present here the basic steps only . following the usual approach",
    ", we consider the action functional of the model ( with @xmath71 the emcs lagrangian ) @xmath72 the entropy function is the legendre transform of the above integral with respect to the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are related to the angular momentum and the electric charge of the solutions , respectively .    within this approach ,",
    "the einstein equations correspond to @xmath77 note that in the presence of the cs term in the action , the corresponding analysis for the gauge potentials is more intricate @xcite , and recovering the relations for @xmath78 in ( [ nh1])-([nh3 ] ) requires some care .    within the entropy function formalism ,",
    "the considered configurations are characterized by two independent parameters , for which we would like to choose the angular momentum and electric charge . in order to calculate them",
    ", one can employ the noether charges approach @xcite .",
    "then the expression of the total angular momentum is @xcite @xmath79 a result which is also obtained from the equation @xmath80 the corresponding expression of the electric charge is @xcite @xmath81 which is equivalent to @xmath82 then the solutions have an entropy @xmath83 where @xmath84 will be identified with the horizon area of the global extremal solutions . for the purposes of this work",
    "it is also of interest to consider the horizon angular momentum @xmath85 , which can be calculated using the standard komar formula ( with the killing vector @xmath86 ) @xmath87 note that although the cosmological constant is not explicitly found in the above expressions , it enters via the relations ( [ nh1])-([nh3 ] ) .",
    "if we fix the cs constant @xmath0 and the ads length scale @xmath88 , the near - horizon solutions only depend on the angular momentum @xmath16 and the electric charge @xmath13 .",
    "unfortunately , the relations ( [ j1 ] ) , ( [ qe1 ] ) , together with ( [ nh1 ] ) , ( [ nh3 ] ) are very complicated and thus it is not possible to give an explicit expression for the entropy @xmath89 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath16 ( the same holds for the horizon angular momentum @xmath85 ) .    however , it is a straightforward problem to compute those expressions numerically .",
    "this reveals a rather complicated picture , with the possible existence of several branches of solutions .",
    "let us start by addressing first the @xmath65 limit of the solutions , ( @xmath66 em - ads theory ) , in which case partial analytic results are at hand ( see the eqs .",
    "( [ nh_emads ] ) ) . in agreement with our physical intuition ,",
    "one finds two different branches of solutions , corresponding to two different possible ways to generate extremal em - ads global solutions .",
    "one of the branches contains the near - horizon geometry of the extremal rn - ads bh as the @xmath90 limit .",
    "then a whole branch is generated when adding spin to that limiting solution .",
    "therefore , we call this set the _ rn branch_. the second branch contains the near - horizon geometry of the extremal mp - ads bh as the uncharged limit . in this case",
    ", the whole branch is generated when electric charge is introduced into that near - horizon geometry . as such , this set",
    "is called the _ mp branch_.",
    "these two branches are shown in figure 1 , with a @xmath91-diagram ( left ) and a @xmath92-diagram ( right ) ( note that the electric charge is fixed there ; also all results in this section are found for an ads length scale @xmath93 ) .",
    "interestingly , these two branches never intersect , @xmath66 there are no attractor solutions connecting them .",
    "this leads us to predict that the global solutions will also be on disconnected branches .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of the electric charge , we shall find two branches of extremal bhs , which however , can not be connected by global solutions whose near - horizon geometry is described by a squashed @xmath24 metric .",
    "0.45    0.45      the picture for @xmath22 ( @xmath66 an emcs - ads theory ) is more complicated .",
    "first , in this case , if we fix the cs coupling @xmath0 , the sign of the electric charge becomes relevant . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath94 without any loss of generality and show results for several small values of @xmath0 .",
    "for the discussion we shall fix @xmath95 and the ads length to @xmath93 , although we have explored other values of these parameters and the features described below are generic .",
    "let us start with the positive @xmath13 case .",
    "then , for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the branch structure is similar to that of the pure em - ads case and one finds again two separated branches of near - horizon solutions ( see figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p_nh ] ) .",
    "one of them , the rn branch , contains the near - horizon limit of the extremal rn - ads bh .",
    "the other one , the mp branch , contains the near - horizon geometry of the extremal mp - ads bh .",
    "moreover , both branches are disconnected .",
    "then the prediction above for the global solutions still holds for these emcs solutions .    however , this structure changes drastically for @xmath98 , where a bifurcation happens . for this specific value ,",
    "both branches connect at some particular configuration which does not seem to possess special properties .",
    "when @xmath99 one finds again two disconnected branches after the bifurcation .",
    "these features are shown in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p_nh ] , for @xmath100 ( purple curve ) and @xmath101 ( cyan curve ) .",
    "now let us continue with the negative @xmath13 case , which presents very different properties .",
    "there it is more convenient to show the branch structure by plotting the horizon angular momentum @xmath85 @xmath102 the total angular momentum @xmath16 , as we do in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_n_nh ] . the main feature always present in @xmath103 solutions is the appearance of a _",
    "critical _ near - horizon solution with vanishing horizon area ( marked with a square in the figure ) .",
    "this near - horizon solution is always separating the near - horizon geometry of the extremal mp - ads bh from the near - horizon geometry of the extremal rn - ads bh .",
    "hence a prediction of the near - horizon formalism is that in this case we always find ( at least ) two branches . for fixed @xmath13 ,",
    "critical _ solution has a certain value of angular momentum @xmath104 , which increases as @xmath0 goes to zero ( in fact , one finds @xmath105 as @xmath106 ) .",
    "the horizon angular momentum of the _ critical _ solutions also vanishes .    for small enough values of @xmath0 , we observe also other interesting features .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath107 .",
    "then the mp branch can have more than one solution with the same angular momentum . in figure",
    "[ fig : jh_small_lambda_n_nh ] , this can be seen for @xmath101 ( cyan curve ) , where a vertical line of constant @xmath16 can intersect up to three times with the curve . however , as @xmath0 increases this behavior is lost , see the @xmath108 curves in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_n_nh ] .",
    "yet another interesting behavior can be observed on the rn branch . in figure",
    "[ fig : jh_small_lambda_n_nh ] one can see that the near - horizon formalism predicts the existence of counter - rotating solutions .",
    "for instance , consider the curves with @xmath101 ( cyan ) and @xmath108 ( red ) .",
    "it can be seen that for large enough @xmath16 , and for solutions satisfying @xmath109 , the horizon angular momentum goes from positive to negative .",
    "in fact for @xmath110 , the rn branch always has negative horizon angular momentum , @xmath111 .",
    "we have studied as well solutions with @xmath112 and it turns out the ( qualitative ) picture described above for @xmath113 holds in that case , in particular the existence of a @xmath114 configuration with @xmath115 .",
    "a discussion of this property for the @xmath116 case is given in appendix a , based on the analytical clp solution .",
    "however , new features occur for @xmath117 , in which case the branch structure becomes qualitatively similar to that of the asymptotically flat case @xcite .",
    "essentially , for @xmath103 the near - horizon geometry of the extremal rn - ads bh is no longer the only solution with @xmath90 , but there is a @xmath90 near - horizon solution , which is not static .",
    "we will comment more on that later , when discussing the global aspects of these solutions .",
    "the discussion of the branch structure for @xmath117 can be found in @xcite ( flat case ) , and , since it is recovered here , we refer the reader to that paper .",
    "to make contact with the previous numerical work on the @xmath5 em(cs ) system @xcite , @xcite we introduce the new angular coordinates @xmath118 where @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath120 $ ] and @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "also , we fix the metric gauge and reparametrize the functions in ( [ metrici ] ) by taking @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a background function employed to enforce ads asymptotics ( note that the ads@xmath19 spacetime is recovered for @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) . for completeness , we give the corresponding expression of the line element @xmath126 while the corresponding expression of the gauge potential is @xmath127    with this ansatz , the einstein equations reduce to a set of four second - order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the metric functions @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 @xmath132 together with the 1st - order constraint equation @xmath133 the gauge potentials @xmath134 , @xmath135 satisfy the 2nd - order odes @xmath136 the equations for @xmath134 and @xmath137 have a total derivative structure , which implies the existence of the first integrals @xmath138 with the constants of integration @xmath13 , @xmath16 , corresponding to the angular momentum and electric charge of the solutions , respectively ( see the relations ( [ kang2 ] ) and ( [ charge ] ) ) .      the far field expression of the solutions can be constructed in a systematic way , the first terms of the expansion at infinity being @xmath139 the expression of the higher - order terms is rather complicated , without being possible to identify a general pattern for the coefficients . here",
    "we mention only that this asymptotic expansion contains five undetermined parameters @xmath140 , which encode the global charges of the solutions .",
    "the total angular momenta of the bh can be calculated using the standard komar integral @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( with @xmath143 ) .",
    "these configurations have equal - magnitude angular momenta , @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "then one finds the following expression @xmath146 the computation of the electric charge is also standard , @xmath13 being obtained from @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "the computation of the total mass @xmath12 , however , requires special care , since the result from a naive application of the komar integral diverges already in the vacuum case without the gauge field .",
    "however , @xmath12 can be computed @xmath36 by using the ashtekar - magnon - das conformal mass definition @xcite , which results in @xmath149 @xmath12 can also be computed by employing the boundary counterterm approach in @xcite , wherein it is the conserved charge associated with killing symmetry @xmath150 of the induced boundary metric , found for a large constant value of @xmath50 .",
    "this results in the same expression ( [ mass - ct ] ) , plus a constant casimir term @xmath151 @xcite , which we shall ignore in what follows .",
    "we mention that @xmath16 can also be computed by using the approach in @xcite or the one in @xcite , the results coinciding with ( [ kang2 ] ) .",
    "let us also note that @xmath12 and @xmath16 are evaluated relative to a frame which is @xmath152 at infinity .",
    "the solutions possess also a magnetic moment @xmath153 which is fixed by the constant @xmath154 which enters the asymptotic expansion of the gauge potential @xmath155 , @xmath156 thus , one can define a gyromagnetic ratio @xmath157 @xmath158      in the quasi - isotropic coordinates we are employing , the bh horizon @xmath159 resides at @xmath160 ( where the function @xmath128 vanishes ) , and rotates with angular velocity @xmath161 .",
    "this is a killing horizon , since the killing vector @xmath162 becomes null and orthogonal to the other killing vectors on it , @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165    for nonextremal solutions , the following expansion holds near the event horizon : @xmath166 where @xmath167 are numerical coefficients subject to the constraint @xmath168 note that for extremal bhs the event horizon is located at @xmath169 , in which case the near - horizon expansion is more complicated @xcite . also , this results in a different expression of the horizon quantities as compared to the one above .    restricting to the non - extremal case ,",
    "the area of the horizon @xmath170 and the hawking temperature are given by @xmath171 the horizon angular velocity is obtained in terms of the inertial dragging @xmath172 further , the horizon electrostatic potential @xmath173 is defined by @xmath174 being constant at the horizon .",
    "it is also of interest to compute the horizon mass @xmath175 and the horizon angular momenta @xmath176 , which are given by the standard komar integrals ( with @xmath177 ) : @xmath178 in the case we are interested here both horizon angular momenta have the same magnitude so we can refer to them simultaneously as the horizon angular momentum @xmath85 , with @xmath179 .",
    "note that the quantities above satisfy the horizon smarr formula @xmath180 however , different from the asymptotically flat case , no simple smarr - type relation can be written for asymptotically ads configurations , in particular for the solutions in this work .",
    "a proposed generalized smarr - type relation could include the cosmological constant as a negative pressure term @xcite .",
    "this possibility has been explored for mp - ads , rn - ads and cpl bhs in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that the emcs charged spinning bhs satisfy the 1st law of thermodynamics @xmath181 an extra term involving variations of the cosmological constant ( @xmath182 ) can also be added to this formula @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the conjugate variable to the pressure @xmath183 can be identified with the volume @xmath184 of the space - time outside the event horizon .",
    "however in our calculations we will always consider families of configurations with a fixed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the extension of the results in @xcite , @xcite for numerical solutions ( in particular for those in this work ) remains an interesting open problem .",
    "unfortunately , no exact emcs - ads closed - form solution is known apart from the clp one ( with @xmath1 ) with its rn - ads ( @xmath90 ) and mp - ads ( q=0 ) limits .",
    "the basic features of this special solution are discussed in appendix a.    the bhs with @xmath185 are found numerically .",
    "the numerical methods we have used are similar to those used in the literature to find numerically other @xmath5 bh solutions with equal - magnitude angular momenta , @xmath36 those in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in our scheme , we choose to solve a system of four second - order differential equations ( odes ) for the functions @xmath186 ( [ eqs - fin ] ) , ( [ eqaphi ] ) , together with the two first - order odes for @xmath187 , relations ( [ conq ] ) .",
    "thus , in the generic case , the input parameters are @xmath188 together with @xmath189 . the equations are solved by using the software package colsys @xcite , subject to appropriate boundary conditions compatible with the asymptotics ( [ far - field ] ) , ( [ eh - expansion ] ) .",
    "this solver employs a collocation method for boundary - value ordinary differential equations and a damped newton method of quasi - linearization .",
    "a linearized problem is solved at each iteration step , by using a spline collocation at gaussian points .",
    "the package colsys possesses an adaptive mesh selection procedure , such that the equations are solved on a sequence of meshes until the successful stopping criterion is reached .",
    "the solutions reported in this work have a typical relative accuracy of @xmath190 .",
    "the number of mesh points used in our calculation was around @xmath191 , distributed non - equidistant on @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is a compactified radial coordinate employed in the non - extremal case ( for extremal solutions we have used @xmath194 ) .",
    "the profiles of three typical solutions , new sets of @xmath195 solutions occur , with a node structure for both @xmath135 and @xmath131 . ] with @xmath113 , @xmath10 , @xmath196 and fixed values @xmath197 ,",
    "@xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath93 , are shown in figure [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "varying @xmath0 does not seem to lead to new qualitative features ; in particular the metric functions @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 always exhibit a monotonic behavior . also , we have noticed that the difference between solutions profiles for different @xmath0 and the same @xmath200 becomes more transparent when the bhs are close to extremality .",
    "we mention that all solutions reported in this work have @xmath201 for any @xmath202 , while @xmath129 and @xmath130 remain strictly positive .",
    "thus @xmath203 is a global time function and the bhs are free of closed timelike ( or null ) curves @xcite . also , they show no sign of a singular behavior set of extremal solutions discussed in subsection 5.3 . ] on the horizon or outside of it , that would manifest itself in the ricci or kretschmann scalars ( which were monitored for most of the solutions ) .",
    "in addition , all the solutions we have analyzed present an ergoregion , inside of which the observers can not remain stationary and will move in the direction of rotation .",
    "the ergoregion is located between the horizon and the ergosurface @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , @xmath66 @xmath206 ( note that , in contrast to @xmath207 kerr - like bhs , the ergosurface does not touch the horizon ) .",
    "the determination of the full domain of existence of the solutions would be a huge task . in this work , we will only attempt to sketch its shape by analyzing the pattern of solutions on some generic surfaces in the space of parameters . also , to simplify the study , we set the ads length scale @xmath93 , such that all quantities are given in these units . moreover , without any loss of generality , we consider values @xmath208 for the cs coupling constant , only ( as such , we have to consider both signs for the electric charge ) .",
    "we have considered solutions with a large set of @xmath0 ranging between 0 and 50 .",
    "however , solutions with larger @xmath0 are very likely to exist and we conjecture the absence of an upper bound for the cs coupling constant .",

    "a second branch of global extremal bhs is found coming from large values of @xmath297 , and ending at the point @xmath299 .",
    "note that these two branches are in agreement with parts of the branches predicted by the near - horizon formalism .",
    "the points @xmath298 and @xmath300 are connected by a particular set of extremal solutions ( blue dashed line ) , which is called in what follows the _ gap _ set .",
    "these solutions emerge as the limit of near - extremal global configurations and appear to possess some pathological properties .",
    "for example , the kretschmann scalar takes very large values at the horizon , which makes the direct construction of the extremal solutions connecting @xmath298 and @xmath300 difficult .",
    "the global non - extremal solutions exist in a domain bounded below by the global extremal bhs connected by the gap set .",
    "another important feature one can see in figure [ em - my ] is that a part of the near - horizon solutions do @xmath301 have global counterparts .",
    "numerical results supporting the above picture are shown in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda ] , where we consider extremal solutions with a fixed electric charge @xmath302 and several values of @xmath0 ( qualitatively similar pictures have been found for other values of @xmath13 ) . the case @xmath214 is shown in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p ] .",
    "the grey , orange and pink curves there correspond to near - horizon solutions with @xmath65 , @xmath303 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "note that these solutions have been presented already in section 3 , where we have noticed the existence of two different branches of near - horizon solutions for small enough values of @xmath0 , ( in particular for @xmath65 and @xmath303 ) , which bifurcate at @xmath304 . in the same figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p ] we add the corresponding sets of @xmath70 extremal solutions ( for example , the red thin line represents global extremal bhs in pure em - ads theory ) .",
    "a similar structure is found for other small enough values of the cs coupling constant , in particular for @xmath303 , see figure [ fig : phi_q0 ] .",
    "one can see that when @xmath305 the space of configurations no longer presents a _ gap _ set .",
    "for instance , consider in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p ] the blue line .",
    "this is the set of global extremal solutions with @xmath101 , and it matches perfectly ( in one to one correspondence ) with the near - horizon solutions ( pink line ) .",
    "let us consider now the negative charge case , @xmath103 .",
    "some results in this case are shown in figure [ fig : jh_small_lambda_p ] .",
    "one can see that the qualitative picture discussed above for @xmath214 still holds .",
    "for example , consider the pure @xmath101 case ( blue curve ) .",
    "then one finds again the existence of a _ gap _ set ( dashed blue line ) connecting two disconnected branches of bhs that end at two different _ limiting _ solutions ( blue dot and blue triangle ) . as a consequence , not all near - horizon solutions for this value of @xmath0 ( pink line ) correspond to global solutions .",
    "the _ limiting _ solution with @xmath289 can not be reached for this value of @xmath0 .",
    "the situation changes when @xmath306 , in which case the gap disappears ( see the curve for @xmath113 ) .",
    "the two branches of extremal bhs ( green line ) are now joined at the _ limiting _ solution with @xmath289 ( green rectangle ) .",
    "interestingly , in this case with @xmath113 , all near - horizon solutions ( orange line ) correspond to a global solution .",
    "however , in the other cases , this is not true .",
    "hence we conclude that also for @xmath103 there are cases for which near - horizon solutions do not correspond to global solutions .",
    "to summarize , the solutions with a small enough value of @xmath0 show a number of features which are not captured by the knowledge of the clp bhs ( @xmath36 the existence of a gap set ) .",
    "0.4    0.4      new features occur as well for large enough value of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , we have considered solutions with @xmath307 and found an overall picture which is qualitatively similar to the one obtained in the asymptotically flat case @xcite .",
    "the most interesting new feature here is the appearance of a set of non - static extremal bhs with vanishing total angular momentum , @xmath90 .",
    "this special set contains a large number of @xmath308 solutions , possibly an infinite one .",
    "however , it is natural to conjecture the existence of solutions with arbitrarily high values of @xmath130 . ] .",
    "its members can be labeled by an integer @xmath309 , which can be identified with the the number of nodes found in the profiles of the metric function @xmath310 , and of the magnetic gauge potential @xmath311 .",
    "the solutions reported in the previous section are the @xmath312 ones , with @xmath313 ( since they still possess a zero of @xmath310 , @xmath311 , reached as @xmath314 ) .",
    "the mass of the solutions increases with @xmath130 , the numerics indicating that the extremal rn - ads bh mass would be approached as @xmath315 .",
    "other quantities , like the horizon angular momentum and horizon angular velocity decrease with the @xmath130 number .",
    "the profiles of the magnetic gauge potential @xmath155 are shown in figure [ fig : ak_excitations ] for some typical set of @xmath90 extremal bhs with @xmath316 .",
    "the number of nodes leaves an imprint also in the invariant quantities .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : f2_excitations ] the square of the gauge field tensor , @xmath317 , is shown for the same configurations .",
    "the oscillations there are found also for the components of the energy - momentum tensor . as such ,",
    "the excited solutions ( @xmath318 ) possess a `` layer structure '' , with @xmath130 distinct radii where the energy density concentrates .",
    "the more nodes , the more layers the solution develops in the bulk .    however ,",
    "although a number @xmath318 modifies the properties of the bhs in the bulk , the nodal structure is not seen in the near - horizon behavior .",
    "that is , in that limit , they are still described by the same squashed @xmath24 solutions discussed in section 3 .",
    "then , we conclude that similar to the asymptotically flat case @xcite , a given near - horizon configuration can correspond to more than one global solution ( likely an infinite set ) .",
    "the non - extremal bhs possess also excitations , in which case , however , we noticed the existence of a maximal value of @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , as expected , excited solutions exist also for @xmath232 and a nonzero @xmath16 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the excited configurations , with a full study of the branch structure and thermodynamic properties , will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that , unfortunately , no such excited solutions could be found in the special @xmath1 case . in principle , in the absence of a uniqueness proof of the clp solution , their existence can not be excluded .",
    "however , for all input parameters we have considered so far , the nodal structure disappears for values of @xmath0 smaller than two times the sugra value .",
    "this paper has presented a discussion of the basic properties of charged rotating bhs in a @xmath5 emcs - ads theory with an arbitrary value of the cs coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the considered solutions have two equal - magnitude angular momenta , possess no pathologies on and outside of an event horizon of spherical topology , and approach at infinity a globally ads background .",
    "so far , the only known solutions of the emcs - ads model compatible with these assumptions are the bhs found in @xcite by cveti , l and pope ( clp ) for @xmath1 , @xmath66 a minimal gauged supergravity model .",
    "the main questions we have tried to answer were : _",
    "`` how general are the properties of the clp solution ? '' _ and _ `` are there new features for other values of @xmath0?''_.    the main conclusion of our study is that the intuition based on the clp bhs @xmath319 be safely extrapolated to solutions of a generic emcs model .",
    "new unexpected features occur for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 ( in particular for an em model ) and for also for large @xmath0 .    the comparison with the sugra exact solutions is most easily done in the extremal case .",
    "this limit reduces the parameter space of solutions and also allows for a partial analytical understanding based on results within the attractor mechanism .    for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 the most interesting new feature ( which is absent in the sugra case ) ,",
    "is the existence of two disconnected branches of extremal bhs .",
    "the bridge between these bhs is provided by a set of extremal solutions which appear to possess pathological properties .",
    "also , this @xmath320 set can not be described within the attractor mechanism .",
    "new properties occur as well for large @xmath0 .",
    "the most striking one is the existence of excited solutions , which are labeled by the number of nodes @xmath130 of the metric function @xmath310 ( or of the magnetic gauge potential @xmath321 ) .",
    "this nodal structure does not exist in the sugra case , where we could not ( numerically ) find other solutions which in principle could exist apart from the @xmath313 in @xcite .",
    "also , it can not be captured by the near - horizon configurations .",
    "in fact , the relation between the solutions found within the attractor formalism and the global ones is quite intricate .",
    "for example , a given near - horizon solution can correspond to one global solution , more than one global solution ( possibly even an infinite set ) , or , more striking , no global solution at all .",
    "other , less spectacular differences , which occur when varying @xmath0 , are discussed in the section 5.2 .",
    "however , there are also a number of features which seem to be generic for any @xmath0 . for example",
    ", the presence of a cs term always implies the occurrence of a _",
    "critical _ set of extremal solutions with a vanishing event horizon area , @xmath115 .",
    "also , the overall thermodynamical behavior of the solutions is well captured by the exact clp solution , the bhs possessing a positive heat capacity for large enough values of @xmath322 .",
    "moreover , the solutions with large temperatures are less sensitive to changes in @xmath0 .",
    "the solutions obtained in this paper may provide a fertile ground for the further study of charged rotating configurations in emcs theory with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "for example , their generalization to include more scalars is straightforward .",
    "also , in principle , by using the same techniques , there should be no difficulty to construct similar ads solutions in @xmath323 dimensions , with @xmath324 equal - magnitude angular momenta .",
    "also , it would be interesting to find applications of the solutions in this work in an ads / cft context .",
    "however , the fact that all @xmath325 solutions do not solve a supergravity model makes it more difficult to obtain a cft description .",

    "<S> the black holes possess radial excitations which can be labelled by the node number of the magnetic gauge potential function . </S>",
    "<S> solutions with small values of @xmath0 possess other distinct features . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the extremal black holes there form two disconnected branches , while not all near - horizon solutions are associated with global solutions . </S>"
