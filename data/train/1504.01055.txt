    "we then perform a software demodulation of the signal at @xmath11 to extract only the exponential decay of the oscillation amplitude @xmath38 , which is governed by the following equation .",
    "@xmath39 by fitting this formula to the decay we determine the quality factor @xmath40 with a standard uncertainty of about @xmath41 .",

    "a correction of @xmath11 due to a damping - induced frequency shift is not necessary , since the correction factor is fully negligible at these levels of @xmath12 . to further refine and test the long term stability of @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "we perform the above described analysis for multiple , consecutive ring down measurements . for 250 ring downs ,",
    "spaced over 25minutes ( 1500 seconds ) of measurement time , we determine a standard deviation for @xmath11 on the order of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath12 , each an order of magnitude larger than the single - shot statistical variation . using the transfer function of a damped harmonic oscillator , we have the relation between external accelerations and displacement : @xmath44      with our device resting on a vibration isolation platform we measure the spectra of the output voltage to determine the readout noise floor . using equations [ eq : cavrespsinevoltagesimplequad ] and [ eq : tfaccdisp1 ] we convert the voltage spectra into the corresponding displacement .",

    "the noise increases at lower frequencies , though the magnitude is strongly reduced by the stabilizations .",
    "we estimate the shot noise as explained in section [ sssec : shot ] with a measured dc power on the photodiode of 60@xmath0w .",
    "the dark noise measurement includes contributions from the photo receiver and the measurement devices .",
    "this was measured by blocking all light going onto the measurement photodiode .",

    "we converted the measured voltage into acceleration by filtering and scaling it accordingly .",
    "the resulting acceleration noise spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec_comparison_acceleration_g_log ] .",
    "our device achieves an acceleration noise floor better than 8@xmath0g/@xmath1above 1khz .",
    "its low frequency performance is limited by a @xmath52 noise , leading to levels of 900@xmath0g/@xmath53 at 1hz and better than 40mg/@xmath53 at 10mhz ( corresponding to a displacement noise of 2pm/@xmath53 and better than 90pm/@xmath53 respectively ) .",

    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : allan_dev_acc_g ] with and without stabilization . at short integration times",
    "we are limited only by shot noise .",
    "the exact nature of the increase at longer integration times is currently under investigation , and it is presumed to be caused by residual frequency noise or parasitic stray beams in our fiber set - up . each of these contributions is susceptible to acoustic and thermal fluctuations , causing the noise in our set - up to not be constant .",
    "this is evident from the second , shorter measurement with stabilizations shown in figure [ fig : allan_dev_acc_g ] , which presents the best levels of long - term stability achieved during our measurement campaign , even though the readout noise floor was significantly higher .",
    "our frequency reference mach - zehnder interferometer was placed in the same thermal environment as our laser source and was isolated passively against thermal fluctuations .",
    "the use of active thermal stabilizations for the fiber interferometer may help to improve the performance in future implementations .",
    "we reach the minimum of our allan deviation at about 1ms of integration time with a value of @xmath54 g .    during our investigation",
    "we found that the use of fiber circulators , to feed light to the accelerometer and to detect the reflection , caused an increased coupling of laser frequency noise into the measurement .",
    "we attribute this to parasitic beams , introduced by the excess leakage in the return path of the circulator , that are phase modulated relative to our signal of interest by the frequency noise .",
    "these beams , or stray light , can reach significant amplitudes in comparison to the reflected signal of the low finesse cavity , which is only about 4% of the incident power , and contaminate the interfered signal , leading to enhanced coupling of laser frequency noise and other phase noise in our fiber set - up . using a 50/50 fiber beam splitter we were able to actively tune and ultimately minimize this coupling by terminating the open , unused output of the splitter .",
    "this improvement in stability comes at the cost of reducing the detected power to about one quarter of the levels achieved with a circulator .",
    "future implementations have to take these parastic signals into account to reduce the coupling of laser frequency noise to the signal from the actual cavity . as an example of what may be possible with such a device having a higher - finesse optical readout , figure [ fig : allan_dev_acc_g ] shows allan deviations for the high finesse cavity readout implemented by guzman et al .",

    "any external acceleration measured with our devices is converted into a readout voltage . in the following ,",
    "we describe and model this conversion and its self - calibration as a chain of individual transducer steps .",
    "this allows us to i ) determine readout noise of the devices , scale factor uncertainty , bias stability and dynamic range for a given set of parameters , and ii ) to determine the parameters that are necessary to reach a desired measurement uncertainty .",

    "the high stiffness and the correspondingly small test mass displacements of our device lets it be described as a damped harmonic oscillator ( ho ) with an angular resonance frequency @xmath11 , a mechanical quality factor @xmath12 and an effective oscillator mass @xmath61 .",
    "the conversion of acceleration into displacement is given , in the frequency domain , by the transfer function @xmath62 described in equation [ eq : tfaccdisp1 ] .",
    "correspondingly , a measured displacement in the time domain is converted back into an acceleration by computing @xmath63      the acceleration readout is fundamentally limited by thermal acceleration noise @xmath64 induced by the finite temperature of the oscillator and mechanical losses @xcite .",
    "@xmath65 this is approximately a white noise that is simply added to @xmath59 , and therefore , only contributes to the readout noise floor , but it does not influence the scale factor , nor the bias stability .      the scaling of acceleration into displacement depends only on two parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and on the signal frequency @xmath66 , as indicated by equation [ eq : tfaccdisp1 ] .",
    "we can estimate the scaling at two critical points of the frequency response . at dc and at low frequencies",
    "the scaling simplifies to @xmath67 , with no @xmath12 dependency . near resonance",
    "the influence of @xmath12 is maximal and @xmath68 .",
    "the estimation of both parameters is critical for the scale factor accuracy .",
    "the measurement of @xmath11 is done by comparing the oscillation to a frequency standard , which , in turn , makes the uncertainty of the standard one of the parameters fundamentally limiting the achievable scale factor uncertainty .",
    "the measurement uncertainty of @xmath12 , which can be determined with different techniques , is only limited by the integration time and the readout noise floor .",
    "larger values of @xmath12 require in general a longer measurement time , due to the increase in relaxation time @xmath69 .",
    "as briefly mentioned above , the harmonic oscillator model is only an approximation of the real behavior of the sensor . a full model that allows us to estimate the error of our approximation is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "however , we present the relevant parasitic effects , included as additional transfer function @xmath70 in our model , by separating them into three categories and we discuss their expected behavior .",
    "the parallelogram design of our oscillator ensures that higher order modes are well separated in frequency and that their main axis of motion is perpendicular to the fundamental mode .",
    "figure [ fig : modessimulation ] shows the results of a finite element model analysis of our sensors , which verifies the mode spacing , as well as the reduced coupling of higher order modes into the critical z - axis . as we can see from the plot , the detection of the oscillator motion close to the top surface is not ideal for reducing coupling of the higher modes , especially @xmath71 , into @xmath72 . hence , future devices might use larger v - grooves or otherwise optimized geometries to detect the displacement at the optimal point , if these modes prove to be limiting in the future .",
    "our oscillator devices are designed to be operated in vacuum and under small effective displacements , significantly less than 1 nm . hence , residual gas damping and mechanical losses inside the oscillator are the dominant contributions , which are well described by a linear viscous damping model .",
    "variations in these parameters are not at all critical , since they are incorporated into the measured @xmath12 ( providing that these parameters do not change significantly between the measurement time and the self - calibration ) .",
    "non - viscous damping effects , like structural damping , can result in a different transfer function from acceleration into displacement .",
    "one direct way to investigate such effects is to excite the accelerometer with known amplitudes at various frequencies to verify the transfer function , an experiment that will be conducted at a later point",
    ".      simple beam deflection theory , which is part of the basis for the linear harmonic oscillator model , breaks down for large displacements , at which point additional higher order dependencies on the input frequency become relevant and the fundamental mode loses energy , effectively decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "these effects limit the dynamic range of the oscillator , which relates , for a given readout uncertainty , to a maximum acceleration .",
    "one can characterize these behaviors experimentally , by operating the device under the desired maximum acceleration .",
    "for low frequencies such a measurement has to determine whether higher harmonics of the excitation frequency are present in the readout . for frequencies close to the resonance",
    "this can be combined with a measurement of @xmath12 under varying levels of excitation . the total deflection for accelerations of up to",
    "2 g is on the order of 5 nm .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the thickness of the flexure in z - direction ( 255@xmath0 m ) , which leads us to expect this contribution to be very small .",
    "our model for the propagation of the test mass displacement @xmath60 into reflected optical power @xmath18 is shown in figure [ fig : cavmodel ] .",
    "model of the metrology chain from test mass displacement to reflected power.,width=264 ]      the total cavity length is a combination of a constant term @xmath73 , the test mass displacement @xmath60 , and any unwanted , parasitic influences @xmath74 caused , for example , by thermal expansion of the sensor . using the laser wavelength sweep measurement , the total cavity length can be determined in situ .",
    "time dependent parasitic changes will cause an unwanted proportional output signal , inducing noise and decreasing the bias stability , and , for significant changes , a scale factor change .      the effective cavity reflectivity for a low - finesse external fiber micro - cavity has been studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "models are available that include the influence of angular misalignment and multiple reflections . in case of low reflectivity",
    "one can approximate this function with the sinusoidal response for a simple two beam interference , neglecting all geometric and gaussian beam effects .",
    "the resulting reflected intensity @xmath75 of the cavity is then given as @xmath76 experimentally , this response is implicitly characterized by the laser wavelength scan described in section [ ssec : lasscan ] .",
    "since the real response of the cavity is somewhat more complicated , it is expected that this approximation will limit the scale factor accuracy . in the following , we will present a few equations for the sinusoidal model , which are simple and useful for calculating errors due to shot and laser intensity noise for the low - finesse cavity , and we will present the more general formulas for the airy function model , which is applied to determine the scale factor and for cavities with higher finesse . for the linearized sinusoidal model the reflected intensity around the quadrature point @xmath27 can be estimated @xmath77 from this approximation it becomes clear that the response depends on the laser wavelength , as well as its stability .",
    "changes in @xmath19 will move the operating point that was used during measurement characterization , independent of the applied response model , which changes the effective scale factor and bias .    using the airy function model ( see equation [ eq : airyfunc ] ) , which includes multiple reflections , we generalize the cavity reflected intensity around a given operating wavelength @xmath78 as @xmath79 in case of a hypothetical perfect cavity model , the laser wavelength uncertainty represents the fundamental limit for the displacement readout accuracy .      for large displacements at a given uncertainty the linear approximations of equations [ eq : sine ] and [ eq : genresp ]",
    "introduce errors in the scale factor and generate signals at higher harmonics of the input signal .",

    "changes in the laser frequency ( which are inverse to wavelength fluctuations ) couple into the readout as phase noise , causing an effective displacement noise .",
    "this is caused by the interference between the reflections , which are delayed relative to each other by twice the cavity length .",
    "the effective coupling for small delays in comparison to the readout frequencies is given as @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the speed of light and @xmath82 is the laser frequency noise .",
    "the reflectivity of the cavity is sensed with the power sent into the fiber .",
    "@xmath83 we determine the change in reflected power for the airy function model as @xmath84      relative amplitude / intensity noise ( rin ) has to be taken into account as well .",
    "its influence can be described as two separate effects .",
    "the first effect is that rin directly influences the scaling factor , as evident from equation [ eq : cavrespsinepower ] .",
    "the second effect is a coupling into the readout as additive amplitude noise . to quantify this effect we write the optical power @xmath85 in terms of a constant component and an additive power noise @xmath86 ,",
    "@xmath87 the dc component of the optical signal can now be rewritten as a constant term and a fluctuation noise term .",
    "@xmath88 the effective length noise @xmath89 due to rin can be estimated , by computing the ratio of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for the sinusoidal model this corresponds to @xmath92 for the more general cavity response we can write this as @xmath93 here we omit any power losses in our fiber set - up , which simply scale the effective power @xmath85 . experimentally , one can simply measure the reflected power at quadrature @xmath94 to determine the correct scaling .",
