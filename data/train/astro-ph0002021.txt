    "understanding the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is now recognised as an important step on the path towards reaching an understanding of agn themselves - how they form , how they are fuelled and how the differences between the various classes of object arise . in two areas in particular the nature of the host galaxy",
    "gives us a direct insight into the workings of the agn : galaxy properties seem to play a role in determining the radio loudness of the central engine ( powerful radio sources are almost never found in spiral or disc - dominated systems  though see mchardy et al .",
    "1994 ) ; and amongst radio - loud objects the host galaxies offer a powerful , orientation - independent means of testing models which attempt to unify different types of agn via beaming and viewing angle effects ( _ eg _ urry & padovani 1995 ) . the observations presented here attempt to address both of these issues by comparing the galaxies associated with the three main types of powerful agn : radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and radio galaxies ( rgs ) of fanaroff & riley type ii .",
    "only once the problem of separating the diffuse galaxy emission from the wings of the quasar point spread function ( psf ) has been overcome can one can begin to describe and classify the morphologies , brightness profiles and interaction histories of the quasar hosts . over the last decade improvements in ground - based techniques and the advent of the hubble space telescope ( hst )",
    "have revolutionised our understanding of quasar host galaxies .",
    "evidence for mergers or interactions in the form of morphological disturbances and close companions is a common feature of these images , but a significant number of quasars are also found in what appear to be undisturbed hosts .",
    "in addition , the idea that radio - loudness is a straightforward consequence of the host galaxy type has had to be abandoned . although some radio - quiet quasars are found in spirals ( _ eg _ hutchings et al .",
    "1994 ; rndahl , rnnback & van groningen 1997 ) in general the hosts of both radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars tend to have properties consistent with early - type galaxies ( _ eg _ vron - cetty & woltjer 1990 ; disney et al .",
    "1995 , hutchings & morris 1995 , bahcall et al .",
    "1997 , mcleod , rieke & storrie - lombardi 1999 ) and typically have luminosities @xmath4 ( _ eg _ dunlop et al .",
    "1993 , bahcall , kirhakos & schneider 1994 , 1995ab , 1996 ; hutchings et al .",
    "1994 , boyce et al .",
    "1998 , hooper , impey & foltz 1997 ) and in many cases are comparable in mass to brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "meanwhile , mcleod & rieke ( 1995a ) find evidence for a _ lower _ limit on the @xmath5-band luminosities ( and hence the mass of the red , established stellar populations ) of galaxies hosting radio - quiet agn , which appears to increase as the nuclear luminosity increases , implying that the nuclear activity is closely linked to the mass of the bulge component of the host .",
    "this impression has been reinforced by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who find that _ all _ the rqqs with @xmath6 in their hst sample occur in massive elliptical galaxies , with only the least luminous radio - quiet objects lying in disc - dominated hosts .",
    "many long - held views about the triggering of nuclear activity and the origins of radio loudness are currently being reassessed in the light of these imaging studies , but images can not tell the whole story . a completely independent way of characterising the host galaxies of agn is via analysis and classification of their stellar populations and starformation histories .",
    "the aim of the observations described in this paper was to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra of quasar hosts and radio galaxies for use in spectrophotometric modelling to determine the nature and history of their stelllar constituents .",
    "previous off - nuclear spectroscopy of the host galaxies of quasars has produced mixed results .",
    "boroson & oke ( 1982 ) were the first to detect an unequivocably stellar continuum from the nebulosity surrounding the radio - loud quasar 3c48 and subsequent studies revealed stellar continua and emission / absorption features around several other quasars ( boroson , oke & green 1982 ; boroson & oke 1984 ; boroson , persson & oke 1985 ; hickson & hutchings 1987 ; hutchings & crampton 1990 ) .",
    "however , except for the general result that there appeared to be systematic differences between the spectra of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasar hosts , these studies produced little advance in our understanding of the relationship between rqqs , rlqs and rgs for the reasons outlined below .",
    "in general the quasar targets were chosen virtually at random , often for the sole reason that they were ` interesting ' and/or unusual . until now",
    "a programme of off - nuclear spectroscopy for statistically useful and properly matched samples of rqqs and rlqs has never been carried out , nor has any attempt been made to compare the off - nuclear spectra of rlqs with equivalent _ off - nuclear _ spectra of radio galaxies .",
    "the early work also focussed mostly on emission - line activity , with discussion of the stellar continuum being confined to classification as red or blue , and the identification of a few stellar features .",
    "only limited attempts were made to use the form of the spectrum to investigate the composition and evolution of the stellar population .",
    "finally , few of the host galaxy spectra were taken sufficiently off - nucleus - _ eg _ the spectra taken by boroson and collaborators were taken only 3@xmath7 from the quasar .",
    "this was done in the belief that any further off - nucleus the host galaxy would be too faint for a reasonable spectrum to be obtained , but inevitably resulted in significant contamination of the host galaxy spectrum by scattered light from the quasar nucleus .",
    "a scaled version of the quasar spectrum had therefore to be subtracted from the off - nuclear spectrum to reveal the spectrum of the underlying host , but the extra noise and systematic errors introduced by this process severely limited the quality of the final spectra .",
    "thus , the main obstacles in these previous attempts to classify the hosts of powerful agn were the difficulty in separating the underlying starlight from the glare of the quasar and - less immediately , but still of some importance - the lack of well - defined samples of a sufficient size to carry out straightforward statistical comparisons .",
    "as far as possible , the design of the current study was intended to circumvent both these problems with the goal of obtaining clean spectra of the stellar component of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasar hosts and radio galaxies , which could then be used to search for systematic differences and similarities between the stellar populations and of the galaxies hosting each type of activity .",
    "despite that fact that the radio galaxies lack bright nuclear point sources we were careful to adopt exactly the same observing strategy as used for the quasars to ensure that the data would be directly comparable .    in this paper",
    "we describe the observations and present the spectra .",
    "a second paper ( nolan et al . 2000 ) will describe the results of spectrophotometric modelling to estimate the ages and starformation histories of the galaxies ( preliminary results have already been reported by kukula et al .",
    "the current paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the samples used and section  3 details the observing and data reduction strategies chosen to optimise the amount of starlight collected by the various instruments employed throughout the study .",
    "section  4 gives an overview of the data obtained and sections  5 and 6 contain more detailed information on the individual spectra .",
    "dunlop et al . ( 1993 ) and taylor et al . ( 1996 ) observed a sample of intermediate - redshift ( @xmath8 ) radio - loud and -quiet quasarsw  hz@xmath9sr@xmath9 . ] and fanaroff - riley type ii radio galaxies ( rgs ) in the near infrared ( @xmath10-band:2.2@xmath11 m ) in order to compare the luminosities and morphologies of the galaxies associated with these three main types of powerful active nucleus .",
    "the choice of waveband was informed by the low quasar : host ratio in the near infrared , which allowed accurate determination of the galaxy properties from the ground with the minimum amount of confusion from the point spread function of the central quasar .",
    "their sample was carefully constructed to ensure that the different types of object could be compared directly with one another : the radio - loud and -quiet quasars both have the same distribution of optical luminosities ( @xmath12 ) and both the radio - loud quasars and the radio galaxies have similar extended radio luminosities and morphologies and steep radio spectra .",
    "the sample is therefore ideal for investigating the influence of galaxy properties on the ` radio loudness ' of otherwise very similar quasars , and also for testing unified models of rlqs and rgs which predict that the properties of their hosts should be identical .",
    "a substantial subset of the sample has also formed the basis for an @xmath13-band imaging study using hst ( kukula et al .",
    "1999 , mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "dunlop et al . 2000 ) , in which the enhanced angular resolution of hst has allowed both unambiguous identification of the host morphology and identification of detailed substructure in the quasar hosts and radio galaxies .",
    "this sample provides an ideal starting point for a spectroscopic study of host galaxies because , in addition to the careful selection criteria , the existence of deep near - infrared images of every object provides us with a unique opportunity to minimise the contamination of the galaxy spectra by quasar light .",
    "armed with knowledge of the extent and orientation of the host galaxy on the sky one is able to choose a slit position which is far enough from the nucleus to avoid the worst excesses of scattered quasar light , but which simultaneously maximises the amount of galaxy light falling onto the slit .    out of the the 40 objects in the original taylor et al .",
    "sample a total of 26 objects were observed in the current study ( 9 rqqs , 10 rlqs and 7 rgs ) .",
    "details are listed in table  1 .",
    "note that the radio source 3c59 has been shown by meurs & unger ( 1991 ) to consist of three separate sources , of which only the weakest appears to be associated with the quasar 0204 + 292 . as a result , the radio luminosity of 0204 + 292 places it below our dividing line of @xmath14w  hz@xmath9sr@xmath9 and we classify it as an rqq .",

    "in order to asssess the feasibility of our observing strategy initial observations of 11 of the nearest and brightest objects in the sample were carried out using the mayall 4-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "this was followed by a larger programme of observations using the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , part of the isaac newton group of telescopes on la palma .",
    "tables 2 and 3 list the observations made on the mayall 4-m telescope and the wht respectively .",
    "six objects ( 0054@xmath18144 , 0157@xmath18001 , 0736@xmath18017 , 2141@xmath18279 , 2247@xmath18140 and 2344@xmath18184 ) were observed with both telescopes in order to provide a check for consistency between the two sets of observations .",
    "the spectra for these objects are discussed in more detail in section  6 .",
    "observations of 11 objects were carried out with the r. c. spectrograph on the mayall 4-m telescope at kitt peak in 1992 september and 1993 march ( table  1 ) .",
    "the long - slit spectrograph uses a tektronix @xmath24 chip with 24-@xmath11 m pixels , designated t2 kb .",
    "the slit width was set to 3@xmath7 and the instrument was configured to give a spectral resolution of 1.9 / pixel and a spatial resolution of 0.69@xmath7/pixel .",
    "the slit was first centred on the quasar ( or , if the object was a radio galaxy , on the galaxy centroid ) , before being rotated and offset to the desired position , usually 5  arcseconds off - nucleus .    to allow the removal of cosmic rays five 1800-second off - nuclear exposures were obtained for each object , along with a shorter exposure of the quasar itself .",
    "the spectra typically spanned wavelengths from 3500   to 6000 , although the precise range varied from object to object according to redshift ; details for individual objects are given in table  2 .",
    "data reduction was carried out using standard iraf routines .",
    "after the two runs at kitt peak had demonstrated that galaxy light could indeed be separated from that of the quasar and that useful spectra could be obtained , further observations were made of 22 objects ( 6 of which had already been observed at kitt peak ) with the intermediate dispersion spectroscopic and imaging system ( isis ) at the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma .",
    "isis uses a dichroic mirror to split the incoming light into red and blue beams which are then treated separately in spectrographs which have been optimised for the appropriate wavelength ranges ( @xmath25   for the blue arm and @xmath26   for the red ) .",
    "this arrangement allows a larger wavelength coverage than is possible with the single spectrograph on the mayall 4-m , enabling us to extend our spectra further into the red and thus giving greater scope for constraining models of spectrophotometric evolution .",
    "the data were obtained in four separate observing runs in 1993 november , 1994 may , 1994 september and 1995 march .",
    "the instrumental set - up differed slightly between the runs , resulting in variations in the wavength ranges obtained .",
    "for the two sessions in 1994 the detectors in both the blue and red arms were tektronix ( ` tek ' ) ccds , with 24-@xmath11 m pixels . in november 1993 and march 1996 the tektronix chip in the red arm",
    "was replaced by an eev  p88300 chip , with 22.5-@xmath11 m pixels , which allowed a slightly larger wavelength coverage .",
    "r158 gratings were used in each arm , giving a spectral resolution of 2.88  pixel@xmath9 for the blue tek chip and 2.90 ( tek ) or 2.72  pixel@xmath9 ( eev ) for the red chips .    as with the observations at kitt peak the slit",
    "was first centred on the quasar nucleus , or the optical peak of the radio galaxy , and then offset to the desired position , 5@xmath7 from the quasar , and rotated to be at right angles to the direction of the offset . the slit width was set to 2@xmath7 , placing the inner edge of the slit at least 4@xmath7 from the quasar position .",
    "once again exposures were limited to 1800 seconds duration .",
    "whenever possible we aimed to obtain five such frames per object , giving a total on - source exposure time of 2.5 hours . on - nuclear quasar spectra",
    "were also taken when time permitted .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the figaro package , part of the starlink suite of astronomical software .",
    "the galaxies observed with the wht tend to be fainter and/or at greater redshifts than those observed on the mayall 4-m at kitt peak , and so additional care needed to be taken during the reduction of the wht spectra .",
    "in particular , the procedure employed to optimize the extraction of the off - nuclear spectrum from the ccd frame means that the final flux calibration is only relative and not absolute - comparisons with the absolute fluxes obtained on the mayall 4-m are therefore not meaningful .",
    "the use of the red and blue arms of isis , whilst extending the wavelength coverage significantly , also introduces its own special problems . the large wavelength range made available by isis means that the spectra are affected by several prominent atmospheric emission features ( figure  1 ) which must be removed",
    "of these the strongest are the two oxygen lines at 5577 and 6300 , the sodium d line at 5890 , and the series of oh bands at wavelengths @xmath27 .",
    "sky lines were removed by fitting a third order polynomial to two empty strips of sky on either side of the target spectrum but the removal process sometimes left a residual imprint of these features and this constitutes a major source of noise in some of the fainter spectra in our sample . where this is the case the affected regions are mentioned in the description of the individual spectrum .",
    "a second problem involves the splicing together of the two spectra from the red and blue arms of the instrument to give continuous wavelength coverage from 3200   to 9000 .",
    "the reflection and transmission responses of the isis dichroic cross at @xmath28   and the instrument settings were designed to ensure a large overlap between the wavelength coverages of the two arms so that the full reflection / transmission curves could be followed in the blue and the red spectra respectively .",
    "however , the faintness of many of the spectra effectively causes the flux calibration to fail at the red end of the blue spectrum and the blue end of the red , producing an artificial ` lump ' in the spliced spectrum at the crossover point ( 6100   or 6050 , depending on the exact instrumental settings at the time of the observations - see column  8 in table  3 ) .",
    "accordingly , in plotting the wht spectra in figure  2 we have blanked out the data points for 100   on either side of the join region and replaced them with an averaged bridging section .",
    "we have masked out this section of the data in all subsequent modelling due to its inherrent unreliability ( see nolan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "due to the luminosity of the quasars themselves the on - nuclear spectra obtained with the wht do not suffer from this problem and the red and blue sections have been spliced together directly with no noticeable discontinuity in flux at the join .",
    "the galaxy spectra themselves are displayed in figure  2 along with nuclear spectra for the same object , where such are available .",
    "all the data have been smoothed to 10-   bins , and the wht data are displayed with the region linking the individual red and blue spectra blanked out as described above .",
    "the expected position of various stellar absorption features , including the 4000   break are indicated by dotted lines in the off - nuclear spectra and the wavelengths of redshifted [ oiii]@xmath29 and h@xmath30 are also marked .",
    "a cursory examination of figure  2 is enough to show that the quality of the off - nuclear spectra varies considerably from object to object . in the two initial observing runs at kitt peak priority",
    "was given to nearby objects with bright , prominent host galaxies , and the eleven spectra obtained with the mayall 4-m enjoy a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "by contrast , the objects observed in later runs on the wht tend to have larger redshifts and the signal - to - noise in many of these spectra is correspondingly lower due to the rapid reduction in surface brightness and increase in galactocentric radius with @xmath15 .      the primary goal of the observing program - to obtain spectra from the stellar component of the host whilst avoiding scattered emission from the active nucleus - appears to have been satisfied to a large extent .",
    "this can be demonstrated most easily by comparing the off - nuclear ( galaxy ) and nuclear spectra for the same object in figure 2 .",
    "the quasar spectra show prominent broad lines , notably those of h@xmath31 and h@xmath32 , with an increase in flux towards shorter wavelengths ( particularly when the ` blue bump ' continuum feature begins to emerge at @xmath33 ) .    whilst emission lines do occur in the off - nuclear spectra",
    ", they tend to be relatively narrow forbidden lines such as [ oiii]@xmath34 .",
    "where permitted lines occur , they lack the extremely broad profiles seen in the quasar nuclei , and are thus unlikely to result from scattering - induced contamination by nuclear light . in many cases",
    "the line ratios in the off - nuclear spectra also differ from those measured in the quasars , indicating that the emission arises under different conditions than those prevailing in the active nucleus",
    ".    however , in spectra obtained under conditions of poor seeing , there is likely to be some degree of nuclear contamination and this will be exacerbated if the object was observed far from the zenith , where differential atmospheric refraction may also lead to signifcantly more contamination at the blue end of our wavelength range than in the red .",
    "although the extent of such contamination is difficult to measure directly , tables 2 and 3 list the atmospheric seeing and airmass at the time each spectrum was obtained , to allow a rough assessment of the problem to be made .",

    "if a significant population of massive young stars is present the enhanced degree of ionization causes the feature to weaken ; it is most prominent in the spectrum of a well - established stellar population in which the most massive stars have had time to evolve away from the main sequence .",
    "hence the 4000  break is sensitive to both spectral type and metallicity , although if we assume a constant metallicity ( a reasonable assumption for a particular galaxy at a fixed radius ) it becomes a good indicator of the mean age of the local stellar population .",
    "the strength of this feature , as measured in each of the current spectra , is listed in table  4 .",
    "other stellar absorption features , such as g band ( 4300 to 4320 ) and the mg ib ( 5173 ) and fe@xmath53 lines , are also clearly present in many of the spectra .",
    "several of the off - nuclear spectra ( _ eg _ 0054 + 144 , 2201 + 315 ) , despite showing a clear break at 4000   and a continuum longwards of this wavelength which can be fitted extremely well by a passively ageing stellar population ( nolan et al .",
    "2000 ) , also display a contribution from a component which rises steeply towards the blue .",
    "the slope of this feature closely resembles that of a quasar sed , and its presence is often ( but not always ) accompanied by emission lines characteristic of quasar nuclei , suggesting that it is in fact scattered light from the quasar itself , the result either of atmospheric scattering or ( since the feature is not always correlated with poor observing conditions ) of scattering within the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that the blue excess indicates the presence of a substantial population of young stars within the host galaxy .",
    "if this latter case were true then it would pose a serious problem for the unification of rlqs and rgs since none of the radio galaxies display such a component .",
    "the issue of excess blue continuum is raised on a case - by - case basis in the following section , but a full discussion in the light of detailed stellar population synthesis modelling is deferred to the companion paper by nolan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the average values of the 4000  break strength for the three types of object in the sample are 1.4 ( rqq hosts ) , 1.5 ( rlq hosts ) and 1.7 ( rgs ) . these are all somewhat lower than the value of @xmath54 measured for local inactive elliptical galaxies by hamilton ( 1985 ) , but we note that there is a wide scatter in our sample and that the lowest values are all associated either with spectra in which the signal to noise is particularly poor ( _ eg _ 0244 + 292 , 1004 + 130 , 1334 + 008 ) or those which clearly show an extra source of continuum emission at short wavelengths ( _ eg _ the quasars 0054 + 144 , 1217 + 023 , 2141 + 175 ) .",
    "the cleanest spectra generally have break strengths which are consistent with those seen in ` normal ' well - established galaxies .    as a final caveat",
    "we note that these spectra tell us only about the stellar composition of the region of the galaxy covered by the slit - we can not , for example , rule out the presence of a significantly different stellar population closer to the nucleus , or concentrated in clumps which the slit happens to avoid .",
    "however , the slit has a width of at least 2  arcsec and , as can be seen from the contour plots in figure 2 , its length cuts across a significant fraction of the galaxy in the transverse direction .",
    "the area covered often amounts to several square arcseconds ( equivalent to several tens of square kiloparsecs at typical redshifts ) and therefore represents a good general sample of the outer regions of the host .",
    "objects are listed under their iau names ( alternative names are listed in table  1 ) , in order of increasing right ascension . the classification of each object as either an rqq , an rlq or a radio galaxy is indicated in parentheses , along with the name(s ) of the telescope(s ) on which off - nuclear spectra were obtained .",
