    "many models exist in the literature which attempt to explain the observed neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the viable models agree with the presently known neutrino oscillation parameters falling within the @xmath3 ranges @xcite : @xmath4 the data suggests the approximate tri - bimaximal mixing texture of harrison , perkins , and scott @xcite : @xmath5    with @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for the plethera of models still in agreement with experiment of course can be traced to the inaccuracy of the present data .",
    "in addition , there are a number of unknowns that must be still determined : the hierarchy and absolute mass scales of the light neutrinos ; the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrinos ; the cp - violating phases of the mixing matrix ; any departure of the reactor neutrino angle , @xmath0 from @xmath8 ; any departure of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle , @xmath9 , from @xmath10 ; whether the approximate tri - bimaximal mixing is a softly - broken or accidental symmmetry ; and the magnitude of the charged lepton flavor violation ? in this presentation we survey some of the models to determine what they predict for @xmath0 , the hierarchy , and lepton flavor violation .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have mass , with the mass squared differences given in eq.([eq : data ] ) .",
    "information concerning the absolute neutrino mass scale has been determined by the combined wmap , sdss , and lyman alpha data @xcite which place an upper limit on the sum of the masses , @xmath11 ev .",
    "an extension of the sm is then required , and possible suggestions include one or more of the following :    * the introduction of dim-5 effective non - renormalizable operators ; * the addition of right - handed neutrinos with their yukawa couplings to the left - handed neutrinos ; * the addition of direct mass terms with right - handed majorana couplings ; * the addition of a higgs triplet with left - handed majorana couplings .",
    "the general @xmath12 neutrino mass matrix in the @xmath13 flavor basis of the six left - handed fields then has the following structure in terms of @xmath14 submatrices : @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix , @xmath17 the left - handed and @xmath18 the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices . with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the type i seesaw formula is obtained @xcite @xmath21    for the light majorana neutrinos , while if @xmath22 and @xmath20 , one obtains the type ii seesaw formula @xcite , @xmath23    the effective light majorana mass matrix is complex symmetric and can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , @xmath24 , to give @xmath25    with real , positive masses down the diagonal . on the other hand , the dirac charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation according to @xmath26 the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath27 @xcite , is then given by + @xmath28    \\phi&=&{\\rm diag}(e^{i\\chi_1},\\ e^{i\\chi_2},1),\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{eq : vpmns}\\ ] ]    in terms of the approximately tri - bimaximal mixing matrix , @xmath29 and the phase matrix , @xmath30 , since an arbitrary phase rotation of @xmath24 is not possible in the above .",
    "models which have been introduced to explain the neutrino oscillation phenomena fall into two categories .",
    "there are those based on some lepton flavor symmetry such as @xmath31 interchange symmetry , the more restrictive @xmath32 or @xmath33 flavor symmetry , and @xmath34 or @xmath35 flavor symmetries .",
    "many attempts have been made to explore the location of texture zeros for the lepton mass matrices , with the hope that some flavor symmetry might be identified that way .",
    "a more ambitious class of models is based on @xmath36 or @xmath2 grand unification , where one attempts to explain the masses and mixings in the quark sector as well as the lepton sector .",
    "these models are said to have a `` minimal '' higgs structure , if the higgs bosons responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking transform as the @xmath37 dimensional representations of @xmath2 , and possibly the @xmath38 or @xmath39 representations .",
    "they lead to symmetric or antisymmetric entries in the mass matrices .",
    "other @xmath2 models have higgs bosons which transform as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 representations and are referred to as `` lopsided , '' since lopsided contributions to the down quark and charged lepton mass matrices can occur due to the @xmath36 structure of the @xmath43 s . for recent reviews , cf .",
    "in a previous publication @xcite we have made a survey of 63 models in the literature which give the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution for the solar neutrino oscillations and firm and reasonably restrictive predictions for the reactor neutrino angle .",
    "the cutoff date for the selection of models was chosen to be may 2006 . in this study",
    "we found most of the models predict a value in the range of @xmath44 with a normal hierarchy preferred by 3:1 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig . 1 in the form of a @xmath45 histogram , where the models are distinguished according to their type , and each",
    "is assigned the same area on the histogram though their imprecise predictions may cover several bins .",
    "predictions for all 63 models . ]    since the planned double chooz and daya bay reactor experiments @xcite will reach @xmath46 , roughly half of the models will be eliminated , either by the positive or negative signal of disappearance of @xmath47 s from their beams . but even if a positive signal for the disappearance is seen , fig .",
    "1 . indicates that of the order of 5 - 10 models will still survive , depending upon the accuracy of the measurement and the resilience of the models .",
    "meanwhile the meg experiment @xcite at psi is beginning to look for the @xmath48 decay mode . with plans to lower the present branching ratio limit @xcite of @xmath49 down to the @xmath50 range",
    ", this experiment may serve as an even more immediate selector of models . with this in mind",
    ", we turn to the subject of charged lepton flavor violation as a further distinguishing feature of the models proposed .",
    "with a neutrino mass insertion in the sm.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    it is of interest to look first at charged lepton flavor violation in the sm with the addition of three massive right - handed neutrinos . in this case , individual @xmath51 and @xmath52 lepton numbers are not conserved since majorana mass terms are not forbidden .",
    "the lepton flavor violation then arises in 1-loop diagrams , where the neutrino insertion involves lepton flavor - changing yukawa couplings .",
    "examples of such diagrams are given in fig . 2 for the process @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath53 are elements of the pmns mixing matrix , while the @xmath54 are yukawa couplings for @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is one of the heavy left - handed conjugate neutrinos .",
    "the branching ratio is given by @xcite @xmath57    in this extended sm , the branching ratio is immeasurably small , due to the approximate gim cancellation and the extremely small mass ratios of the left - handed neutrinos to the massive right - handed neutrinos . for such models ,",
    "the meg experiment would be expected to give a null result .    in susy gut models ,",
    "slepton - neutralino and sneutrino - chargino loops contribute to the radiative decays as shown in fig .",
    "3 .     in susy models with slepton mass insertions.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) with universal soft masses and trilinear couplings @xcite , charged lepton flavor violation arises from evolution of the yukawa couplings and soft susy - breaking parameters .",
    "thus with more comparable heavy masses in the loops and no gim mechanism anticipated , the lfv branching ratios can be much larger @xcite .    in the leading log approximation",
    "the largest contribution comes from the left - handed slepton mass matrix yielding a branching ratio @xmath58 where @xmath59 with the yukawa couplings specified in the lepton flavor basis and the right - handed majorana matrix diagonal , so @xmath60 is just the kth heavy right - handed neutrino mass , while @xmath61 is the gut scale typically equal to @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 is some typical susy scalar mass .",
    "petcov and collaborators @xcite have shown that the full evolution effects as first calculated by hisano , moroi , tobe , and yamaguchi @xcite can be extremely well approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : br21susy ] ) , if one sets @xmath64    we shall see that for the susy gut models to be considered , the meg experiment will be able to observe the predicted @xmath65 branching ratios or place further restrictions on those models .",
    "many papers have studied predictions for the lepton flavor violating processes in susy gut models by adopting a generic approach @xcite . following the procedure of casas and ibarra @xcite , with the charged lepton and right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix diagonal , the seesaw formula can be inverted to yield the yukawa neutrino coupling matrix @xmath66    in terms of a complex orthogonal @xmath67 matrix which allows for various unknown right - handed neutrino mixings . by using soft susy - breaking benchmarks , adopting various heavy right - handed neutrino masses and various @xmath67 parametric angles and phases",
    ", one can `` predict '' the radiative lfv branching ratios .",
    "the results are typically presented in the form of monte carlo scatter plots .",
    "one finds the results strongly depend on @xmath68 , and the @xmath67 parameters .",
    "the branching ratios are found to increase by powers of 10 as @xmath0 varies from @xmath69 , while the present branching ratio bound for @xmath65 restricts @xmath70 to lie lower than @xmath71 gev .",
    "instead of adopting a generic approach as described above , we are interested in determining whether one can differentiate between various susy gut models on the basis of their lfv predictions , even if they have similar predictions for @xmath45 . for this purpose",
    "we have selected five @xmath2 susy gut models which are highly predictive , i.e. , their model parameters are precisely specified by the authors .",
    "the models differ in the flavor symmetry chosen and the higgs representations used to break the @xmath2 symmetry at the gut scale and the electroweak symmetry at the weak scale .",

    "the ab , cy and dr model predictions for @xmath82 are barely within reach of those experiments .",
    "the gk model prediction would most likely require a neutrino factory to reach that level .",
    "note that relatively low values of @xmath83 are preferred for four of the models , while the dr model favors a high value .",
    "relatively mild hierarchies for the massive right - handed neutrinos are predicted for the cm , dr and gk models , but the heaviest one occurs in increasing order for these three models , ranging from @xmath84 gev .",
    "the cy model predicts a degenerate right - handed spectrum with a lower value of @xmath85 .",
    "the ab model , on the other hand , puts the heaviest one at @xmath86 gev and the lower two nearly degenerate at @xmath87 gev .",
    "resonant leptogenesis @xcite is possibly an interesting feature of that model .",
    "the five predictive models studied in this work thus cover a wide range of possibilities and suggest that charged lepton flavor violation can play an important role in further narrowing the list of viable candidates .",
    "we now turn to the predictions for the branching ratios for @xmath65 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the five predictive models under consideration .",
    "we use the shorthand convention br21 , br32 , and br31 for these respective branching ratios . working in the cmssm scenario with universal soft parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 for a given @xmath83 and @xmath92",

    "the vertical dashed line reflects the present br21 bound @xcite , while the horizontal dashed line refers to the present br32 or br31 experimental limit , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is clear from these two plots that the ongoing meg experiment stands the best chance of confirming the predictions for or eliminating the gk and ab models .",
    "even with a super - b factory , the present experimental bounds on the br32 and br31 branching ratios can only be lowered by one or two orders of magnitude at most @xcite .",
