    "the interest in artificial resonant magnetism in the optical range which was recently inspired by the development of metamaterial science ( see e.g. in @xcite ) is expected to grow after successful demonstration of the subwavelength optical imaging obtained in the far zone of objects with the use of so - called _ hyperlenses _ @xcite .",
    "hyperlenses transform evanescent waves into propagating ones and create the spatially magnified optical images keeping subwavelength details of the objects .",
    "known hyperlenses operate with tm - polarized waves .",
    "this polarization is related to the negative permittivity of metals ( which are used by known hyperlenses ) in the visible frequency range .",
    "similar operation with the te - polarized light would require materials with negative permeability .",
    "materials with negative @xmath0 in the visible range do not exist in nature .",
    "recently , many attempts to engineer such materials were reported .",
    "they include , for example , lattices of paired plasmonic nanowires , nanoplates , nanocones , fishnets , and plasmonic split rings @xcite .",
    "these structures are all geometrically strongly anisotropic .",
    "the strongest magnetic response corresponds to one specific direction of the propagation of electromagnetic wave .",
    "notice , that in cited papers the magnetic response of these structures was reported only for this single direction .",
    "the possibility to use strongly anisotropic artificial magnetic media in superlenses and hyperlenses has not yet been studied .    the first work devoted to the possibility of",
    "the isotropic optical magnetism that can not be achieved in the mentioned anisotropic structures was , to our knowledge , @xcite .",
    "the idea of the present paper is to link this resonant magnetism to the existing technology and to find the design which ensures the real isotropy of the resonant permeability , i.e. absence of strong spatial dispersion .",
    "we use the term strong spatial dispersion for the case when the dispersion diagram of the lattice is quantitatively different from the dispersion in any continuous media .",
    "weak spatial dispersion is a special term applied to designate effects of artificial magnetism and bianisotropy in composite media @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "one suggested to prepare optical magnetic media using plasmonic ( colloids of noble metals ) nanospheres arranged in nanorings . in high - frequency magnetic field @xmath1 nanocolloids",
    "are polarized in the azimuthal direction with respect to this field . to obtain an isotropic resonant magnetic medium one should fabricate a dense array of nanorings lying in 3 mutually orthogonal planes .",
    "the dense isotropic package means that the array of nanorings must be a fcc or a bcc lattice , that allows us to consider the structure as a photonic crystal .",
    "the theoretical prediction of @xcite shows that in this case the resonance of the effective permeability @xmath2 can be strong enough so that the real part of @xmath2 takes negative values .",
    "however , from @xcite it has not yet been clear how to fabricate these structures and their isotropy was not proved .",
    "in fact , an isotropic artificial magnetism is not possible for photonic crystals ( lattices with strong spatial dispersion ) .",
    "formally , the resonant magnetic permeability as well as the permittivity can be attributed to photonic crystals as well ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , at frequencies where a cubic lattice becomes a photonic crystal the refraction index and the wave impedance both become strongly dependent on the propagation direction @xcite .",
    "this implies that effective material parameters @xmath3 or / and @xmath2 of the crystal are very different for a wave propagating along one of the lattice axes and for a wave tilted with respect to this axis .",
    "this evidently means the absence of the isotropy .",
    "of course , the random mixture of particles is more optically isotropic than the lattice with the same concentration of particles .",
    "however , in the present case the requirement of the negative magnetic response of the composite medium obviously implies the very dense packaging of magnetic scatterers . in the present case",
    "we can not suppress the spatial dispersion using the randomization of the array .",
    "the comparison of the approximate dispersion diagram for the homogenized lattice with the exact dispersion diagram was done in some papers , e.g. in @xcite . in @xcite the fcc ( face - centered cubic ) and bcc ( body - centered cubic ) lattices of metal - covered dielectric spheres",
    "were studied .",
    "it was found that in fcc and bcc lattices the spatial dispersion effects arise within the frequency band of the plasmonic resonance .",
    "the spatial dispersion in this region leads to closing the resonance band - gap with simultaneous strong anisotropy of the lattice refraction index .",
    "these effects correspond to the frequencies at which the distance between adjacent particles centers exceeds one quarter of the wavelength in the matrix .",
    "unfortunately , in the known literature there are no general results for the frequency intervals where the effects of strong spatial dispersion arise in lattices . of course",
    ", it is clear that the frequency range corresponding to @xmath4 definitely implies the strong spatial dispersion since @xmath5 is the bragg resonance condition . in lattices of strongly scattering inclusions",
    "the condition of the absence of strong spatial dispersion becomes more restrictive since the polarization of inclusions shortens the effective wavelength @xmath6 compared to @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that the artificial resonant magnetism in arrays of small complex - shape metal particles at microwaves practically corresponds to relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the typical size of the particle @xcite and @xmath10 is the wavelength of the magnetic resonance of a particle in host medium .",
    "notice , that the ratio @xmath11 is practically achievable , e.g. for well - known double split - ring resonators ( srrs ) .",
    "srrs of this optical size can be considered as small enough to avoid the strong spatial dispersion in a compact lattice .",
    "then we can consider the low - frequency stop - band of this lattice associated with the resonance of srrs as the effect of the negative permeability . really , magneto - electric media are opaque when their material parameters have different signs",
    ".    however , the metamaterial suggested in @xcite corresponds to a quite large optical size of a magnetic scatterer at its resonance , where the condition @xmath12 is far from being fulfilled . really , consider the results for @xmath2 illustrated by fig .",
    "2 ( a , b ) of @xcite .",
    "the negative permeability was theoretically achieved at @xmath13 or @xmath14 thz with nanorings of the following geometry .",
    "six or four metal nanospheres of radius @xmath15 nm are centered at the circle of radius @xmath16 or @xmath17 nm .",
    "this means that the size @xmath9 of the effective magnetic particle ( i.e. the distance between the edges of opposite metal nanospheres ) is @xmath18 or @xmath19 nm .",
    "the wavelength in the host medium with background permittivity @xmath20 at @xmath13 thz is equal to @xmath21 nm .",
    "then the size of the nanoring from 6 spheres is @xmath22 i.e. the optical size is rather large .",
    "the packaging of these nanorings in the host medium was assumed in @xcite to be very dense , namely corresponding to their concentration @xmath23 nm@xmath24 .",
    "this concentration is physically achievable for a bcc or a fcc lattice of nanorings .",
    "however , even so dense packaging corresponds to the distance between the centers of adjacent nanorings @xmath25 .",
    "having in mind results of @xcite we believe that in this case the strong spatial dispersion arises and the isotropic magnetism is impossible .    the clear way to decrease spatial dispersion in a lattice of magnetic scatterers i.e. to suppress the angular dependence of @xmath2 is to decrease the size of a scatterer keeping its magnetic polarizability . in this way we will also decrease the optical distance between the centers of adjacent magnetic particles . below",
    "we modify the design of magnetic particles suggested in @xcite in this way .",
    "we obtain the ratio @xmath26 which is presumably below the range of the strong spatial dispersion .",
    "simultaneously , we link our design to existing nanotechnologies .",
    "the design of the optical magnetic scatterer suggested in this paper is based on the possibility to fabricate arrays of silver or gold colloidal nanoclusters located on spherical dielectric cores in a liquid host medium .",
    "the fabrication technology uses self - assembled adhesion of metal nanospheres on the silica core .",
    "the idea of such self - assembling aggregates was probably first realized in @xcite .",
    "however , this process led to the complete covering of the silica core by contacting gold nanoparticles .",
    "the process chemically stimulated by some acids which allowed one to control its speed and to obtain the needed number of nanocolloids per one core was described in @xcite .",
    "later , nanoclusters comprising few tens of colloidal particles on a silica core of diameter of the order 100 nm were reported in works @xcite . for obtaining the maximal electromagnetic response for given sizes ( of the core and of the nanocolloids ) their number @xmath27 per one nanocluster should be as large as possible .",
    "however , it is difficult in this way to prevent the touching of nanocolloids which is destructive for their plasmonic resonance that will degrade due to the tunneling of electrons between nanocolloids .",
    "practically , minimal separation @xmath28 between nanocolloids should be comparable with the radius of colloidal particles @xmath29 .",
    "below we respect the condition @xmath30 that restricts @xmath31 .",
    "this can be practically obtained using the technology described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in these works the silica core of diameter 100 nm ( the technology allows in principle to reduce this size to 20 - 30 nm ) was covered by mutually touching polystyrene nanospheres . instead of simple polystyrene nanospheres",
    "one can use core - shell particles with plasmonic nanocolloids as cores .",
    "this method will allow us to reliably control the separation @xmath28 between colloidal particles which is simply equal to the double thickness of the polystyrene shell .",
    "such a nanocluster is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ( a general view ) and ( b ) ( a cross section ) .",
    "it should have the isotropic resonant response to the electromagnetic field of light . at one frequency",
    "the induced electric dipole dominates , and the polarization of colloidal particles is parallel to the electric field of light . at another frequency",
    "the induced magnetic dipole dominates , and the polarization of colloidal particles is azimuthal with respect to the magnetic field . in other words , the applied magnetic field form the effective nanorings of colloidal spheres glued to the silica core .",
    "both electric and magnetic resonant frequencies origin from the plasmonic resonance of an individual colloidal nanosphere . in this paper",
    "we study only the magnetic resonance of such a nanocluster",
    ". therefore we call it a magnetic nanocluster ( mnc ) .",
    "bulk arrays of mnc can be created not only in liquid but also in porous matrices where the separation between the pores should be small enough to obtain the high concentration of mnc and a strong magnetic response of the medium .",
    "below we will see that the frequency of the magnetic resonance of mnc is strongly reduced compared to the frequency @xmath32 of the plasmonic resonance of a single nanocolloid .",
    "this effect results from the strong electrostatic coupling between the nanocolloids in the mnc .",
    "this electrostatic coupling exists also in a single nanoring studied in @xcite , and it leads to a certain reduction of the magnetic resonance frequency compared to @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the present geometry this reduction is much stronger since the most important electrostatic interaction is that between colloids having parallel electro - dipole moments .",
