    "some observations suggest that gas clouds in and out of galaxies are related to outflows from the galaxies .    in the galactic halo , there are clouds of neutral hydrogen with a velocity greater than @xmath0 ; they are called high velocity clouds .",
    "there has been an argument about the origin .",
    "one idea is that they result from outflows from the galaxy ; thermal instability in the flows leads to cloud formation @xcite .",
    "the other is that they are made from metal - poor gas falling from the outside of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "recently , however , @xcite found that the iron abundance in a high velocity cloud in the galactic halo is half of the solar value , which supports the former idea .",
    "recent observations of ly@xmath1 absorption system show that the absorbers are associated with galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , the spectroscopy and broadband imaging of galaxies toward 3c  273 indicate that the ly@xmath1 absorbers are not distributed at random with respected to the galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an anticorrelation between ly@xmath1 absorption equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter .",
    "moreover , metals have been found in the absorption system , which means that the gas is enriched by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the absorbers are made from the gas ejected from galaxies . in this case ,",
    "thermal instability in the outflows is expected to play an important role in the formation of the absorbers .",
    "@xcite investigated cooling gas outflows from galaxies .",
    "he studied the outflow form , the effects of the galaxy potential , the size of outflow regions , and the efficiency of radiative cooling .",
    "he found that the hot gas in dwarf galaxies can either flow out as galactic winds , or cool radiatively to form clouds . in the latter case",
    ", the clouds can escape from the galaxies and may become ly@xmath1 absorbers @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite also indicated that the ejected gas from dwarf galaxies can give rise to a damped ly@xmath1 absorber .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that massive galaxies like our own tend to confine the gas ; the gas released into the halo either cools radiatively or results in a galactic corona .",
    "however , @xcite considered only spherical homogeneous flows .",
    "( here , homogeneous means that density and radius from the galaxy center have a one - to - one correspondence . ) in actual galaxies , however , there should be density fluctuations that lead to local thermal instabilities .",
    "@xcite examined the linear evolution of the local thermal instabilities in outflows and found that the growth is relatively weak . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - linear evolution is not understood well , although complex gas structures observed in galaxies suggest the fluctuations in outflows are highly non - linear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although there are simulations done to study the non - linear evolution of instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they can not resolve fine structure of gas such as shells of supernova remnants and gas blobs composed by mass - loss gas from stars ; their scales are typically @xmath2 pc and @xmath3 pc , respectively @xcite .",
    "if these fluctuations grow through radiative cooling , the overdensities condense and are decoupled from outflows .",
    "thus , the substantial quantities of gas may be removed from the outflows , and the form of outflows may be changed . as an instance similar to this one , x - ray observations suggest that a large amount of gas is decoupled from cooling inflows in the central regions of clusters and the cooled gas is deposited in the wide region @xcite .",
    "if it happens to be the same in outflows of a galaxy , the clouds born from the decoupled gas may be distributed in a wide range of radius of the galaxy",
    ".    however , this consideration may be too simplistic ; the motion of overdense regions relative to the ambient gas introduces complication .",
    "if gravity induces the relative motion , the overdense regions mix may with the ambient gas and can not cool anymore .",
    "@xcite numerically showed that the motion strongly depends on magnetic fields ; if the magnetic pressure is strong enough , it goes against the gravity and the overdensities can be sustained .",
    "@xcite estimated that the magnetic pressure could sustain the overdensities in actual galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we consider the non - linear evolution of fluctuations in inhomogeneous outflows of galaxies and its influence on the global structure of outflows . since it is difficult to treat the non - linear evolution exactly , we first consider the most extreme case .",
    "for this purpose , we investigate multiphase comoving flows , in which local thermal instabilities are expected to grow most extremely because the motion of overdense regions relative to the ambient gas is ignored .",
    "we compare the results with those of homogeneous flows .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] we summarize our models for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows . in ",
    "[ sec : result ] we give the results of our calculations and describe the differences between homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows . in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] the fate of the clouds formed in outflows is discussed .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation in a steady , symmetric flow are @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are respectively the density , velocity , and pressure of the gas , @xmath10 is the adiabatic index , @xmath11 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the gravitating mass within @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the proton density , @xmath15 is the cooling function , and @xmath16 is the temperature .",
    "these equations can be rewritten as dimensionless equations for the mach number and the dimensionless temperature ( equations [ 2.14 ] and [ 2.15 ] in @xcite ) .",
    "the model adopted here is based on the multiphase cooling flow model of @xcite .",
    "contrary to the model of @xcite , we consider outflows with relatively large velocity .    using the volume distribution function @xmath17 at time , @xmath18 , and position , @xmath19 , the mass within the volume @xmath20 , in the density range @xmath7 to @xmath21",
    "is given by @xmath22 differentiating ( [ eq : dm ] ) , we obtain the equation of mass conservation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the comoving rate of change of the density of gas with density @xmath7 , and @xmath25 is the velocity . from now on",
    ", we assume that the flow is steady and spherically symmetric for simplicity .",
    "the mass flux function @xmath26 is defined by @xmath27 where @xmath8 is the outward radial velocity . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , we assume that the cooling gas comoves , which means that @xmath8 is a function of @xmath13 alone . thus , there is no local relative motion between gas blobs before they are decoupled from the flow . from equation ( [ eq : mcons ] )",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath26 satisfies the relation @xmath28 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , @xmath26 is constant along streamlines in the @xmath29 plane .",
    "we assume local pressure equilibrium , that is , pressure , @xmath9 , is also a function of @xmath13 alone . in this case",
    ", the streamlines for the cooling gas are determined from two equations ; one is the energy equation @xmath30 and the other is the momentum equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the entropy .",
    "the temperature is given by the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath7 ( or @xmath14 ) .",
    "we assume that the cooling function is described by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath1 are constants .",
    "the spatially averaged density is given by @xmath35 the total mass flow rate , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 .",
    "we can integrate equation ( [ eq : ene1 ] ) and give @xmath38 where @xmath7 is the density at radius @xmath13 of the gas with density @xmath39 at radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the density of the gas at @xmath40 which just has infinite density at radius @xmath13 .",
    "the evolution of cooling gas along the streamlines is determined by @xmath44 . using equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) , equation ( [ eq : ene1 ] )",
    "is described by @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number density corresponding to arbitrary density @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the temperature of gas at pressure @xmath49 and density @xmath47 .",
    "the energy and momentum equations can be solved by assuming the functional form of @xmath26 . according to @xcite , we consider two cases .",
    "one is a power - law form @xmath50 where @xmath51 for some constant @xmath52 . assuming that @xmath53",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56    thus , equation ( [ eq : mom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ene2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the constant pressure cooling time evaluated for @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 if represented by number density ) , that is , @xmath63 since total mass flow rate is @xmath64 , equations ( [ eq : mom_w ] ) and ( [ eq : ene_w ] ) are respectively given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 . using equation ( [ eq : rhobar ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath68 thus , equations ( [ eq : mom_m ] ) and ( [ eq : ene_m ] ) are simultaneous equations for @xmath9 and @xmath36 .",
    "the other form of @xmath26 is an exponential form , @xmath69 as is the case of the power - law form ( equation [ [ eq : power ] ] ) , we have the momentum equation @xmath70 and the energy equation @xmath71 where @xmath72",
    "according to @xcite , we adopt the cooling function for a gas with solar metal abundance , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this is a good approximation at @xmath74  k. note that this cooling function may not be appropriate to study the formation of ly@xmath1 absorbers because their observed abundance is about 1/100 solar .",
    "however , although the absolute value of the cooling function with the abundance is about one tenth of that of equation ( [ eq : coolf ] ) , the temperature dependence is not much different from @xmath75 for @xmath76  k @xcite .",
    "thus , the evolution of the flow with solar abundance is similar to that with 1/100 solar abundance and three or four times larger gas density , because their local cooling times are almost identical .    for a model galaxy , we consider the isothermal mass distribution @xmath77 with truncated radius @xmath78 .",
    "we consider both supersonic and subsonic flows .",
    "the mach number of flows , @xmath79 , is taken as unity at the base of the flows . as discussed by @xcite , it is a natural choice at least for the initial condition in supersonic flows , because a smooth transition from a subsonic flow at the center to a supersonic flow at large radius requires that @xmath801 at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the radius beyond which heating ceases @xcite .",
    "the parameters of model galaxies are the same as those in @xcite and are shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "model d1 corresponds to a typical dwarf galaxy in which the gas tends to flow out .",
    "model n1 corresponds to a massive galaxy like our own in which the gas tends to be confined .",
    "models d2 and n2 are the same as models d1 and n2 , respectively , but the initial gas temperature and the total mass flow rate are larger . for the power - law type of mass flux function ( equation [ [ eq : power ] ] ) , we take @xmath83 but the results are not much different even if we take @xmath84 .      as an initial condition , we take @xmath85@xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) at the inner boundary @xmath88 .",
    "since the results for models d2 and n2 are qualitatively similar to those for model d1 , we present only the results for models d1 and n1 here . in figures  [ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : n1 ] , we show the profiles of pressure , density , temperature , velocity , and the ratio of cooling to flow time . for inhomogeneous flows , we plot the average density ( equation [ [ eq : rho_av ] ] ) , and the average temperature given by the ratio of the pressure to the average density . the cooling time and flow time",
    "are defined by @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively . in equation ( [ eq : cool ] ) , we use the averaged density and temperature for inhomogeneous flows . in figures  [ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : n1 ] , we also show the total mass flow rate , @xmath36 , for inhomogeneous flows .    for homogeneous flows , in model  d1 ( and d2 , n2 )",
    "hot gas flows out of the galaxy ( figure  [ fig : d1]d ) , while in model  n1 the hot gas is confined , although the gas is first accelerated by pressure ( figure  [ fig : n1]d ) .",
    "we define a dimensionless variable @xmath91 that is , @xmath92 is the fraction of the energy loss due to radiation during the flow time @xmath93 for a flow with velocity equal to the rotation velocity of the galaxy @xcite . at the initial radius @xmath88 , @xmath94 in model n1 and @xmath95 in others .",
    "this means that galactic gravitational potential is important in model n1 while it is not important in others , which explains the characteristics of the homogeneous outflows .",
    "since initially @xmath96 in model  n1 , the gas first cools adiabatically ; radiative cooling becomes dominant later on ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that in model  d1 although @xmath98 also becomes smaller than one for @xmath99  kpc for homogeneous flow ( figure  [ fig : d1]e ) , the gas temperature of the flow has already been smaller than @xmath100  k at @xmath101  kpc ( figure  [ fig : d1]c ) , that is , equation ( [ eq : coolf ] ) should not be adopted there .",
    "broadly speaking , the profiles of pressure , average density , average temperature , and velocity of the hot gas for inhomogeneous flows are similar to those for homogeneous flows .",
    "however , it is shown that the gas pressure and density for the inhomogeneous flows decrease rather faster than those for the homogeneous flows ( figures  [ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : n1 ] ) .",
    "this is because of the decrease of the mass flux ( equations [ [ eq : ene_m ] ] and [ [ eq : p_ene_m ] ] ) .",
    "in fact , figures  [ fig : d1]f and [ fig : n1]f show that @xmath36 decreases outwardly , reflecting that thermal instability removes overdense regions from the flows . in model  d1 , in the region where @xmath36 decreases ( @xmath102  kpc ) ,",
    "the terms of pressure gradient and gravity in equation ( [ eq : mom1 ] ) are small and the gas expands freely ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "thus , the decrease of @xmath36 reduces @xmath104 because @xmath105 . in model  n1 , in the region where @xmath36 decreases ( @xmath106  kpc ) , the gravity term in equation ( [ eq : mom1 ] ) dominates the pressure gradient term .",
    "this means that the velocity @xmath8 is determined only by the gravitational field and does not depend on the homogeneity of the flow .",
    "thus , the decrease of @xmath36 reduces @xmath104 as is the case of model  d1 .",
    "it is to be noted that even in the region where @xmath107 , @xmath36 decreases ( figures  [ fig : d1 ] and [ fig : n1 ] ) , because @xmath108 is defined for the averaged density and the overdense regions in the flows cool ahead of most of the gas .",
    "the initial conditions for subsonic flows are the same as those of the supersonic flows except for the initial velocity ; we take @xmath109@xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) at the inner boundary @xmath88 .",
    "we present the results for models  d1 and n1 ; the results for other models are qualitatively the same as those for model  d1 .",
    "although gas is confined in a galaxy for all models , the solutions for inhomogeneous flows are different from those for homogeneous flows ( figures  [ fig : sd1 ] and [ fig : sn1 ] ) .",
    "the density increase appearing near the regions where the homogeneous flows terminate does not exist for the inhomogeneous flows .",
    "figures  [ fig : sd1 ] and [ fig : sn1 ] show that @xmath98 decreases rapidly because the velocity of the flows reduces .",
    "thus , radiative cooling becomes important and causes gas condensation near the regions where the homogeneous flows terminate . on the other hand , for inhomogeneous flows ,",
    "radiative cooling makes mass - dropout effective and prevents the density increase from appearing .    in model  n1 in  [ sec :",
    "super ] and in the models discussed in this subsection , radiatively cooled gas piles up at finite distances from a galaxy .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with the assumption of steady flows .",
    "however , if the cold gas turns into dense , compact clouds , the clouds ballistically fall back to the galaxy and the gas accumulation does not significantly affect the global structure of the outflows unless they are disrupted and mix with ambient gas soon after the formation .",
    "the stability of the clouds have been studied by many authors .",
    "for example , although the clouds are subject to kelvin - helmholtz instability , @xcite indicated that the clouds are stable for a long time if they are bound by a sufficiently strong ( self-)gravitational potential .",
    "moreover , @xcite indicated that the evaporation of the clouds by surrounding hot gas may be greatly suppressed by a plasma instability . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the motion of the clouds including the case that the gravity of a galaxy can not stop outflows .",
    "we assume that cooled gas in outflows turns to be stable clouds , which move ballistically .",
    "the initial velocity of the newly formed clouds is expected to be the velocity of the flow at the position of their formation if the formation time - scale is small enough .",
    "we consider whether the clouds escape from a galaxy or fall back under the influence of the galactic potential .",
    "since the mass distribution of our model galaxy is truncated at radius @xmath78 , the escape velocity is given by @xmath112\\ ] ] for @xmath113 .",
    "we take @xmath114 from now on .",
    "if the clouds can not escape from the galaxy , the maximum radius they can reach is given by @xmath115\\:,\\ ] ] if @xmath116 , or @xmath117 if @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the velocity of clouds when they form at radius @xmath120 @xcite . in equations ( [ eq : rf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rf2 ] ) , we assume that @xmath121 . for all the models adopted here , this relation is satisfied .",
    "figures  [ fig : sup ] and [ fig : sub ] show the relation between @xmath120 and @xmath122 for supersonic and subsonic flows , respectively .",
    "first , we discuss supersonic flows .",
    "since in models d1 , d2 , and n2 , the clouds can escape from the galaxy regardless of the position where they are born , we discuss only model n1 .",
    "for the homogeneous flow , assuming that clouds form when the temperature of gas drops to @xmath123  k , the clouds can not escape form the galaxy ( figure  [ fig : sup ] ) . for the inhomogeneous flows , the clouds also can not escape but @xmath122 has a distribution .",
    "the clouds that form nearer to the galaxy center have smaller @xmath122 . by comparing figure  [ fig :",
    "sup ] with figure  [ fig : n1 ] , it is shown that about two third of the clouds formed from the inhomogeneous flows have the orbit which is almost the same as the clouds formed from the homogeneous flow ( @xmath124  kpc ) ; other clouds have smaller apocentric radii .",
    "second , we consider subsonic flows .",
    "for homogeneous flows , the initial velocity of clouds is almost zero , if we assume that they form when the temperature of gas drops to @xmath123  k. thus , the clouds start to fall back to the galaxy immediately . for inhomogeneous flows , most of the clouds can not escape from the galaxy , although the clouds that form near to @xmath125 can escape in models  d1 and d2 ( figure  [ fig : sub ] )",
    "contrary to the supersonic flows in model  n1 ( figure  [ fig : sup ] ) , the clouds that form nearer to the galaxy have larger @xmath122 in models  d1 , d2 , and n2 , because @xmath119 is a strong decreasing function of @xmath13 .",
    "however , in model  d1 for example , in spite of the wide distribution of @xmath122 , it can be shown that more than 90% of the gas which originally composed of the outflow can coast only to @xmath126  kpc by comparing figure  [ fig : sub]a with figure  [ fig : sd1]f .",
    "this can be said to other models as well ; most of the gas dropped out of the flow reaches the almost same radius ( @xmath127  kpc for model  d2 and @xmath128  kpc for models  n1 and n2 ) .",
    "moreover , the subsonic flows can not explain the observed correlation between galaxies and ly@xmath1 absorbers because their separations range 12.4 to 157.4@xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the clouds formed in the galactic halo fall back toward the galaxy . for our model galaxy , a cloud with velocity zero at radius @xmath122",
    "has infall velocity , @xmath130 at radius @xmath131 if @xmath132 .",
    "when @xmath133 and @xmath134  kpc , @xmath135 at @xmath136  kpc .",
    "thus , the observed high velocity clouds may be related to the clouds formed from the subsonic flows .",
    "we study thermal instability in galactic outflows ( or winds ) and its effect on the global structure of the outflows . in order to investigate the maximum effect ,",
    "we consider comoving inhomogeneous ( multiphase ) outflows in which overdense regions move together with ambient gas ; comoving flows may be possible if magnetic fields are strong enough .",
    "we formulate the inhomogeneous flow and apply it to dwarf galaxies and normal galaxies .",
    "we compared the results with solutions for homogeneous flows . for supersonic flows ,",
    "the pressure , density , temperature , and velocity profiles of hot gas for homogeneous and those for inhomogeneous flows are similar .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the density of inhomogeneous flows decreases somewhat faster than that of homogeneous flows as the gas expands .",
    "this is because local thermal instability removes overdensities from the flows owing to local gas condensation . on the other hand , for subsonic flows ,",
    "solutions for inhomogeneous flows are significantly different from those of homogeneous flows near the regions where the flows terminate . while radiative cooling and gas condensation raise gas density near the regions where the homogeneous flows terminate , local thermal instability in the inhomogeneous flows removes overdensities and prevents an upturn of the average density .",
    "the gas radiatively cooled is most likely to form clouds .",
    "the newly formed clouds inherit the velocity of a flow at the position of their formation if the time - scale of the formation is much smaller than the flow time - scale . for supersonic flows",
    ", we find that the clouds can escape from dwarf galaxies regardless of the homogeneity of flows . on the other hand , for massive galaxies like our own",
    ", the clouds can not escape from the galaxies without an extreme starburst ; in particular , the model of an inhomogeneous supersonic flow predicts that the clouds are widely distributed in a galactic halo . for subsonic flows ,",
    "most of the clouds are confined in galaxies regardless of the homogeneity of flows and the galaxy mass .",
    "most of the clouds formed in an inhomogeneous flow reach the almost same radius before being pulled back by gravitation ."
