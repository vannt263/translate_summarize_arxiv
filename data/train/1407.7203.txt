    "similar studies were also carried out for imaginary chemical potential @xcite and the well - known roberge - weiss periodicity is discussed in that context . although hadrons are not present as dynamical degrees of freedom in njl or pnjl model , mesonic modes at real as well as imaginary chemical potential are studied as collective excitations within random phase approximation @xcite and formation of baryons composed of quarks and diquarks has also been studied by solving the dyson - schwinger equation @xcite .",
    "mesons involving heavy quarks have been studied recently in njl and pnjl models @xcite .",
    "the average phase factor of qcd determinant is evaluated through pnjl model in ref.@xcite , where it is argued that since cep lies within the region of vanishing phase factor , location of cep can not be determined by lqcd alone .",

    "these studies revealed the order parameter like behavior of qns , similar to that obtained in lqcd at vanishing baryon chemical potential .",
    "recently it has been shown by some of us @xcite that when isospin symmetry is broken explicitly , the baryon - isospin correlations exhibit an almost linear scaling with the scale of isospin breaking over the entire temperature - baryon chemical potential phase plane .",
    "another well - known formulation to study the strongly interacting matter in nonperturbative regime is the quark meson ( qm ) model and its polyakov loop extended version ( pqm ) , which is used to explore phase transition and phase diagram of qcd @xcite as well as quark number susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the qns is the response of the conserved number density , @xmath1 , with infinitesimal variation in the chemical potential @xmath2 as an external source .",
    "it is then defined as the second order derivative of pressure , @xmath3 , with respect to @xmath4 . on the other hand , according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) , the qns may also be obtained from the time - time component of the current - current correlator in the vector channel @xcite .",
    "the qns is then expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the temporal component of the vector current and @xmath7 is the time - time component of the vector correlation function or self - energy with external four momenta @xmath8 . because of the symmetry of the system the fdt guarantees that the thermodynamic derivative with respect to the external source , @xmath4 is related to the time - time component of static correlation function in the vector channel .",
    "this is known as _",
    "thermodynamic sum rule _ @xcite .    in usual perturbation theory",
    "the loop expansion and coupling expansion are symmetric and the thermodynamic consistency is automatic , for a given order of coupling @xmath9 .",
    "so , it really does not matter which of the equivalent definition is used in ( [ eq.fluc_diss_def ] ) to compute qns for a given order of @xmath9 . for resummed approach like hard thermal loop perturbation theory ,",
    "the loop expansion and coupling expansion are not symmetric because higher loops contribute to the lower order in @xmath9 .",
    "unlike usual perturbation theory , in resummed case an appropriate measure is to be employed @xcite if one desires to compute qns in a given order in @xmath9 correctly using ( [ eq.fluc_diss_def ] ) . in effective approaches like njl or pnjl models the qns is usually obtained @xcite as the second order taylor coefficient of pressure when it is taylor expanded in the direction of the quark chemical potential , @xmath4 with an approximation @xmath10 . in model calculations",
    "any response of a thermodynamic quantity to some external parameters should also account for the fact that the mean fields also depend implicitly on those external parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore , a proper care has to be taken to relate the thermodynamic derivatives ( viz . ,",
    "qns ) with the fluctuation associated with the conserved density .",
    "one of the purposes of the present work is to demonstrate whether the effective models like njl and pnjl explicitly obey the fdt vis - a - vis thermodynamic sum rule .",
    "furthermore , the implicit dependence of the mean fields are usually obtained numerically but this may contain numerical errors which will increase with the order of derivatives .",
    "this is true for either a direct numerical derivative as well as the method of using a fitting function for a polynomial expansion of pressure in terms of chemical potential to corroborate with the taylor expanded pressure . recently",
    "a numerical technique based on algorithmic differentiation @xcite has been developed to solve this shortcoming . in the present work we also propose an alternative analytical formalism to calculate the derivatives of the mean fields with respect to the external parameters . using these derivatives",
    "we are going to calculate the qns in a consistent manner .",

    "the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq.omega ] ) is the fermionic contribution related to the dressed propagator @xmath18 where , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the bare propagator with current quark mass @xmath21 .",
    "the second term in @xmath22 may be considered as the background contribution of the mean field @xmath23 . to utilize thermodynamic relations , derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to the various parameters and the mean fields are often necessary . in this regard care",
    "has to be taken for the explicit appearances of the parameters as well as their presence through the mean fields .",
    "for example , the computation of quark number susceptibility requires derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath11 that appear explicitly in @xmath22 as well as their implicit effects through @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this is an important observation that we want to revisit in the present manuscript .",
    "therefore we set the notation for the explicit derivatives by @xmath24 and that for the total derivatives with @xmath25 for some parameter @xmath26 .",
    "let us start with the computation of the mean field @xmath23 .",
    "one way to obtain @xmath23 is to use the stationarity condition @xmath27 in the mean field approximation , which gives , @xmath28 on the other hand , we may also use the defining equation @xmath29 , which gives the same result as in eq.([eq.sig_def ] ) .",
    "however as discussed above , for the derivative with respect to @xmath21 one should also consider the implicit dependence on @xmath21 of @xmath22 through @xmath23 . in that case",
    "we should rather use the relation , @xmath30 using the stationarity condition for the mean field , the second term vanishes and therefore in this case we get back to the original defining equation of @xmath23 .",
    "interestingly , if we straightway calculate @xmath31 from eq.([eq.omega ] ) and demand it to be equal to @xmath23 , without imposing the stationarity condition ( like in eq.([eq.sigma_fundef ] ) ) , then eq.([eq.sig_def ] ) will emerge as a consistency condition .",
    "the transcendental nature of the solutions of ( [ eq.sig_def ] ) is apparent .",
    "thus a closed form analytical expression of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath32 and @xmath11 can not be obtained from this equation .",
    "one has to solve the equations numerically and obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the implicit derivatives , in general do not disappear , as can be seen from the chiral susceptibility , which is the second order derivative of thermodynamic potential with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath34 the last term in eq.([eq.chiral_suscp ] ) again vanishes due to stationarity condition of the mean field , but the second and third terms will remain and give the implicit contributions .",
    "this implicit dependence is what makes life a little difficult in the mean field calculations which are otherwise quite straightforward .",
    "while the explicit derivatives can be systematically obtained up to any desired order in a closed analytic form , the implicit contributions are usually obtained through numerical derivatives .",
    "normally one has to resort to numerical evaluation of the total derivatives like @xmath35 , or the implicit part like @xmath36 .",
    "such derivatives may either be done by direct difference approximations or by a taylor series method as proposed by us in ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately both these methods tend to give either large errors or become quite insensitive as the order of the derivatives are increased .",
    "a possible alternative to these numerical techniques has been explored in refs.@xcite through the method of algorithmic differentiation .",
    "derivatives up to very high orders may be computed in this technique .",
    "though very efficient and less error prone even for obtaining very high derivatives , the method is algorithmically involved .",
    "one of our main focuses here is to obtain the implicit contribution in a semi - analytic approach so that numerical uncertainties are minimized .",
    "here we shall outline a simple algorithm for obtaining derivatives in a straightforward semi - analytical procedure .",
    "the procedure is completely analytic as far as obtaining the derivatives go .",
    "we shall argue that the total derivatives at any order can be completely expressed only in terms of explicit derivatives up to one lower order .",
    "therefore one can obtain the expressions for total derivatives completely analytically .",
    "only the values of the final expressions so obtained are computed numerically .    for this purpose we shall discuss the derivatives with respect to @xmath11 , though the methodology would be identical for any other similar derivatives .",
    "the only numerics involved will be the momentum integrals , and to this end all the methods of differentiation would have identical efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath11 would give the quark number and its susceptibilities .",
    "since the quark number is exactly conserved one may use the ward - takahashi identity to derive the corresponding three - point functions for the bare and effective theories .",
    "the identity is given as , @xmath37 here @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the four - momentums of the fermion and the boson respectively .",
    "now , @xmath40 limit of eq.([eq.wti_exact ] ) yields the ward identity , @xmath41 which in differential form , gives the insertion factor corresponding to the zero momentum boson line into an internal fermion line . in the imaginary time formalism , at finite",
    "temperature and chemical potential , the fourth component of momentum becomes @xmath42 and thus eq.([eq.wi_diff ] ) can be written as @xcite , @xmath43 using eq.([eq.mod_prop_inv ] ) in the above relation we obtain , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the identity matrix in dirac space .",
    "for the bare propagator we get the expected insertion factor for non - interacting quarks as , @xmath46 let us now consider the derivative of @xmath23 from eq.([eq.sig_def ] ) w.r.t .",

    "this immediately gives us , @xmath75 so we have the matrix equation of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the coefficient matrix of the variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 matrix has the form @xmath80 .",

    "the most interesting part is that while the column matrix @xmath79 changes for every order , the coefficient matrix @xmath88 will remain same as in first order . we expect that this semi - analytical prescription for obtaining field derivatives will certainly give better results specifically in higher order , compared to numerical derivatives .",
