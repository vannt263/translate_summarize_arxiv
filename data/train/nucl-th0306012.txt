    "the angular dependence of the proton yield in low - energy photo - nuclear reactions is described in the chips model and event generator .",
    "the most important assumption in the description is the hypothesis of a direct interaction of the photon with an asymptotically free quark in the nucleus , even at low energies .",
    "this means that asymptotic freedom of qcd and dispersion sum rules  @xcite can in some way be generalized for low energies .",
    "the knockout of a proton from a nuclear shell or the homogeneous distributions of nuclear evaporation can not explain significant angular dependences at low energies .",
    "the same mechanism appears to be capable of modeling proton yields in such reactions as the @xmath11c(e , e@xmath212p ) reaction measured at mit bates @xcite , where it was shown that the region of missing energy above 50 mev reflects `` two - or - more - particle knockout '' ( or the `` continuum '' in terms of the shell model ) .",
    "the chips model may help to understand and model such phenomena ."
