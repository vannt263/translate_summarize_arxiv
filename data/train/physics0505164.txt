    "spiral vortices appearing in the annular gap between the concentric rotating cylinders of the taylor - couette system @xcite are a rather interesting example for the spontaneous formation of a helicoidal structure out of a homogeneous state of a nonlinear forced system when the forcing exceeds a critical threshold . like the competing toroidally closed taylor vortices the spiral vortex structures bifurcate out of the unstructured basic state of circular couette flow ( ccf ) that is stable at small rotation rates of the inner cylinder .",
    "the spiral pattern breaks the rotational symmetry of the annular gap .",
    "it oscillates in time by rotating azimuthally as a whole thereby propagating axially .",
    "the taylor vortex flow ( tvf ) , on the other hand is rotationally symmetric and stationary .",
    "the spiral pattern is effectively one dimensional ( like tvf ) and stationary when seen from a co - moving frame @xcite : the spiral fields do not depend on time @xmath5 , axial coordinate @xmath6 , and azimuthal angle @xmath7 separately but only via the combined phase variable @xmath8 . here",

    "both spirals are advectively rotated by the latter like rigid objects .",
    "their common angular velocity is @xmath18 .",
    "this advection enforced rigid - body rotation of the spiral vortices is also reflected by the fact that the axial phase velocities @xmath19 of an l - spi ( @xmath15 ) and of an r - spi ( @xmath16 ) are opposite to each other , see fig .",

    "it yields simple expressions for the derivatives , it does not require boundary conditions for the pressure , and it avoids difficulties with boundary conditions for more than one velocity field component at the same position .",

    "this deviation significantly reduces for finer discretizations .",
    "we also investigated how the nonlinear solutions change when varying @xmath61 and/or the grid spacing .",
    "from these analyses we conservatively conclude that typical spi frequencies have an error of less than about 0.2% and that typical velocity field amplitudes can be off by about 3 - 4% .",
    "time steps were always well below the von neumann stability criterion and by more than a factor of three below the courant - friederichs - lewy criterion .    in order to trace out the unstable parts of bifurcation branches of tvf and spi solutions we applied different stabilization methods that are described in sec .",
    "in this section we first briefly review spatio - temporal properties of spiral vortices ( @xmath62 ) and taylor vortices ( @xmath2 ) in the absence of any externally enforced axial through - flow . here",

    "they both grow out of the basic ccf state , @xmath63 , that is rotationally symmetric , axially homogeneous , and time translationally invariant . here in our system",
    "with @xmath64 the radial profile of its azimuthal velocity reads @xmath65      the spiral vortex structure is periodic in @xmath66 , and @xmath5 .",
    "it rotates uniformly as a whole like a rigid object in azimuthal direction thereby translating with constant phase velocity in axial direction  the spiral fields @xmath67 do not depend on @xmath68 separately but only the phase combination @xmath69 here @xmath9 is the axial wave number that we always take to be positive and @xmath70 is the frequency .",
    "thus , with @xmath71 , the spiral pattern is one dimensional . comparing the fourier decompositions",
    "@xmath72    one finds that @xmath73    thus only the mode combinations @xmath74 appear in a spi with azimuthal wave number @xmath10 .",
    "the spi phase is constant , @xmath75 , on a cylindrical surface , @xmath76 , along lines given by the equation @xmath77 thus , on the @xmath12 plane of such an unrolled cylindrical surface these lines of constant phase are straight with slope @xmath14 .",
    "and an azimuthal wave number @xmath15 implies a left handed spiral ( l - spi ) while @xmath16 refer to right handed spirals ( r - spi ) with our convention of taking @xmath9 to be positive .",
    "l - spi and r - spi being mirror images of each other under the operation @xmath17 are symmetry degenerate flow states . which of them is realized in a particular experimental or numerical setup depends on the initial conditions .",
    "the lines of constant phase and with it the whole spiral structure rotates in @xmath7 with angular velocity @xmath78 its direction strongly depends on the inner cylinder s rotation due to the influence of the ccf .",
    "the latter decisively determines the shape of the linear spiral eigenmodes that can grow beyond the stability boundary of the ccf state against perturbations with azimuthal wave number @xmath62 . in the parameter range",
    "explored here the spirals rotate into the same direction as the inner cylinder , i.e. , into positive @xmath7-direction so that @xmath79 is always positive , i.e. , @xmath80 . from this rigid rotation one",
    "immediately infers from eq.([phase ] ) that the axial phase velocity @xmath81 of an l - spi ( @xmath15 ) is positive and of an r - spi ( @xmath16 ) it is negative .    for the rotationally symmetric ( @xmath2 ) structure of toroidally closed taylor vortices the lines of constant phases are parallel to @xmath82 .",
    "this @xmath2 pattern is stationary ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the main reason is that the azimuthal flow of the basic ccf state being precisely parallel to the vortex lines of constant phase can not advect them .",
    "however , an axial mean flow , being perpendicular to them can advect them : an externally enforced axial through - flow of strength @xmath83 causes a non - zero axial phase velocity of the taylor vortex pattern that grows linearly with @xmath83 , at least when phase pinning effects are absent as for axially periodic boundary conditions .      in the parameter regime",
    "considered here the bifurcation thresholds for nonlinear spi and tvf solutions , i.e. , the linear stability boundaries of the ccf state against @xmath84 and @xmath2 vortex perturbations @xcite differ only slightly from each other . for our fixed wave number of @xmath85 they intersect at @xmath86 where these two different vortex modes are bi-``critical '' in the sense that their growth rates are simultaneously zero .",
    "the stability boundaries were obtained with a shooting method from the linearized nse .",
    "the nonlinear spi and tvf solutions that were determined with the numerical method described in sec .",
    "[ sec : num - method ] give bifurcation thresholds that differ as a result of the ftcs discretization errors by at most 2% from the linear stability analysis .",

    "[ sec : etf ] ) when the discretization is not refined .",
    "the bifurcation of both , tvf and spi solutions is forward as shown by the bifurcation surface over the @xmath88 plane of fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - u ] .",
    "there the respective vortex solution is characterized by the primary fourier amplitude , @xmath89 , of the radial flow intensity at mid gap , @xmath90 , taken as order parameter with @xmath60 denoting the azimuthal mode index and @xmath56 referring to the axial one , respectively .",

    "[ fig : bif - u ] .",
    "the stability of the vortex states refers to our system with fixed axial periodicity length .",
    "thus , e.g. , eckhaus or benjamin - feir instabilities @xcite that can destabilize periodic patterns in infinite and large systems do not occur here .",
    "furthermore , our periodic boundary conditions allowing free phase propagation enhance the existence range as well as the stability range of spi solutions in comparison with , say , ekman vortex generating stationary lids that axially close the annulus in an experimental setup .",
    "the latter suppress phase propagation in their vicinity so that phase generating and phase destroying defects near opposite boundaries are necessary for the realization of spirals in the bulk of such systems .    in our setup tvf is for @xmath93 stable close to onset . and",
    "it remains so at least up to the largest value of @xmath94 shown in fig .",

    "drive the system in the parameter region c of fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - u ] away from the unstable tvf solution into a stable spi state .",
    "spirals , on the other hand , are for @xmath95 stable close to onset and remain so at least up to the largest value of @xmath94 shown in fig .  [ fig : bif - u ] while for @xmath93 they are unstable at onset ( region d in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - u ] ) .",
    "but then they become stable at larger @xmath32 in region e. the unstable spi solution branch in region d was obtained by suppressing @xmath97 contributions to the radial velocity field @xmath39 at mid gap location .",
    "this stabilized the spi solution against the growth of tvf . lifting this restriction of the available mode space the unstable spi solutions in region d decay into stable taylor vortices .",
    "in the relatively large region e both , spi as well as tvf solutions coexist bistably and the final vortex structure to be found here depends on the initial conditions and the driving history of @xmath98 .",
    "note in particular that for our periodic boundary conditions the region e with stable spirals extends to positive @xmath33 , i.e. , to a situation with co - rotating cylinders .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - om ] the spiral frequencies @xmath11 are plotted over the same control parameter range as the radial flow amplitudes in fig .  [ fig : bif - u ] . also here",
    "we include  for the sake of comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - u ]  the identification of the different stability regions of tvf and spi solution by the symbols a - e explained in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - u ] . at onset @xmath11 agrees within the numerical accuracy of our nonlinear code with the eigenvalue resulting from the linear stability analysis of the ccf state .",
    "the nonlinear spi frequencies further away from onset vary smoothly : the bifurcation surface of @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - om ] has the shape of a cloth that hangs down from a frame given by the linear onset spiral frequencies @xmath99 at the stability threshold @xmath100 of ccf .",
    "the location of minimal @xmath11 on the bifurcation surface is shown by a thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bif - om ] .",
    "thus , the nonlinear spi frequencies are typically smaller than the linear ones but do not deviate substantially from them .",
    "since the linear onset frequencies show a characteristic variation along the bifurcation threshold , @xmath100 , that dictates the form of the whole @xmath11 bifurcation surface we discuss them in some detail .",
    "they , furthermore allow for a simple , yet semiquantitive explanation of the phenomenon of rigid body rotation of spirals in terms of a passive advection dynamics of @xmath101 vortex perturbations , @xmath102 , with lines of constant phase , @xmath103 , that are oriented obliquely to the `` wind '' of the basic azimuthal ccf . to that end",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : om - model ] the onset spiral frequency @xmath99 at the stability threshold @xmath100 of ccf with the `` model '' frequency @xmath104 which is evaluated also at the stability threshold @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath105 is the mean of the rotation rate of the ccf , @xmath106 . for @xmath107",
    "the averaging is done over the radial domain between inner cylinder , @xmath23 , and the first zero , @xmath108 , of @xmath109 ( [ v_ccf ] ) .",
    "thus , at the stability threshold @xmath100 one has @xmath110 when @xmath107 .",
    "however , when @xmath111 , i.e. , when @xmath112 remains positive throughout the gap @xmath108 is replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the restriction of the radial average to the range between @xmath23 and @xmath108 is motivated by an argument of largely hand - waving nature : the linear eigenfunctions for marginally stable spi modes are somewhat centered to this range where the growth of vortex perturbations is supported .    fig .",
    "[ fig : om - model ] shows that the onset spiral frequency @xmath99 agrees perfectly well with the mean ccf rotation frequency ( [ eq : om - model ] ) when @xmath113 . for @xmath107 the model ansatz ( [ eq : om - model ] ) for the global spiral rotation rate overestimates slightly the spiral frequency since eq.([eq : om - model ] )",
    "does not contain contributions from negative ccf rotation rates between @xmath108 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , if one extends in an ad hoc way the averaging domain slightly beyond @xmath108 then the agreement improves significantly .",
    "thus , the onset spiral frequency @xmath99 , i.e. , the frequency eigenvalue can be seen as the mean rotation rate of the ccf  albeit weighted appropriately by the critical eigenfunctions .      in this section",
    "we elucidate the flow structure of spiral vortices in comparison with taylor vortices . to that end",
    "we consider the radial velocity field . in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - profiles ] we show the axial profiles of @xmath114 at mid gap position for @xmath115 being fixed and various @xmath33 that cover the whole interval between the bifurcation thresholds , c.f .",

    "typically spi are less anharmonic than tvf .",
    "also the profiles of both are less anharmonic for positive @xmath33 than for negative @xmath33 and the degree of anharmonicity increases when @xmath33 becomes more negative . for the mirror symmetric",
    "tvf this anharmonicity growth comes from a widening ( narrowing ) of the axial range @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) of radial inflow over which @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and the corresponding decrease ( increase ) of the inflow ( outflow ) velocity .",
    "for the l - spi that propagate in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - profiles ] into positive @xmath6-direction the anharmonicity grows mainly by flattening ( steepening ) of the wave profiles ahead of ( behind ) the crests .",
    "however , @xmath121 increases also for spi albeit less than for tvf .",
    "the variation of the anharmonicity of the vortex profiles can be read off more quantitatively from the results of an axial fourier analysis .",

    "[ fig : anharm ] .    at negative @xmath33",
    "the anharmonicity of tvf can be for rapidly counter rotating cylinders already close to threshold so large that @xmath123 .",
    "this property reflects the fact that for sufficiently negative @xmath33 taylor vortices are effectively smaller in size than the gap width .",
    "there are two main reasons for this size reduction which are both connected to the tendency of vortices to have circular shape : ( _ i _ ) the axial periodicity length @xmath45 reduces the _ axial _ vortex size relative to the gap and , more importantly , ( _ ii _ ) the tvf intensity is _ radially _ restricted not to extend significantly beyond the zero of ccf at @xmath108 since according to the rayleigh criterion @xmath97 radial momentum transport is suppressed by opposite pressure gradients for @xmath124 where the ccf stratification of the squared angular momentum density is stable . with @xmath33 becoming more negative @xmath108 moves inwards and the radial size of taylor vortices",
    ".    however , the @xmath97 rayleigh criterion does not apply to spi .",
    "their @xmath125 radial momentum transport extends further beyond @xmath108 .",
    "therefore spi vortices fill out the whole gap more than taylor vortices , c.f .",
    "[ fig : arrows_tvf_spi ] , and consequently they are less anharmonic .",
    "tvf shows axial mirror symmetry around the position of maximal radial outflow , @xmath116 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : u - profiles ] . in order to measure the degree to which this symmetry is broken in spi we have used the asymmetry parameter @xmath126 evaluated at mid gap with @xmath127 locating the largest radial spi outflow at this @xmath128-value . in this way we found , e.g. , for the spirals of fig .",
    "[ fig : u - profiles ] that the smallest @xmath129 occurs for spirals with the smallest frequency @xmath130 at @xmath131 .",
    "increasing @xmath33 from this value all the way toward the upper spi bifurcation threshold at @xmath132 the frequency increases but @xmath133 remains roughly unchanged at about 0.2 . on the other hand , when decreasing @xmath33 from -74 the asymmetry parameter increases with increasing @xmath11 up to @xmath134 close to the lower spi bifurcation threshold @xmath135 .",
    "thus , fast propagating spirals at large negative @xmath33 show the largest mirror symmetry breaking .      in order to check our numerical results we made a few comparisons with experiments .",

    "it differs slightly from the spi profile ( full line ) in the bulk part of the @xmath42 system with rigid ends . the difference is presumably related to the fact that the axial flow , and in particular the mean - flow @xmath139 ( [ defw_0 ] ) , is different in these two cases as discussed in sec .",

    "<S> we present numerical simulations of vortices that appear via primary bifurcations out of the unstructured circular couette flow in the taylor - couette system with counter - rotating as well as with co - rotating cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> the full , time dependent navier - stokes equations are solved with a combination of a finite difference and a galerkin method for a fixed axial periodicity length of the vortex patterns and for a finite system of aspect ratio 12 with rigid nonrotating ends in a setup with radius ratio @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> differences in structure , dynamics , symmetry properties , bifurcation and stability behavior between spiral vortices with azimuthal wave numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 taylor vortices are elucidated and compared in quantitative detail . </S>",
    "<S> simulations in axially periodic systems and in finite systems with stationary rigid ends are compared with experimental spiral data . in a second part of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we determine how the above listed properties of the @xmath3 vortex structures are changed by an externally imposed axial through - flow with reynolds numbers in the range @xmath4 . among others we investigate when left handed or right handed spirals or toroidally closed vortices are preferred . </S>"
