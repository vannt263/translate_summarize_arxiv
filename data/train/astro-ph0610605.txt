    "stellar systems composed of two or more stars ( binaries , multiples ) are known to exist in a wide range of configurations .",
    "they range from tight spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods of days to years and separations under 10 au @xcite , to marginally bound _ wide binaries _ with orbital periods @xmath14 yr and separations up to 20,000 au ( 0.1 parsec ) or more @xcite . the frequency of stellar binaries , and the statistics of their physical properties ( periods , mass ratios , eccentricities ) provide constraints on theoretical models of star formation @xcite .",
    "binaries are very common in the galaxy , with various estimates of their frequency hovering around 50% of all stellar systems .",
    "the distribution in orbital periods @xmath15 has been estimated over several orders of magnitude , from days to millions of years , in the classical papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the orbital period distribution of spectroscopic doubles was also re - estimated more recently by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be a general consensus in the literature for an orbital period distribution which is uniform in @xmath16 over several orders of magnitude .",
    "the orbital period distribution is traditionally modeled with a power law @xmath17 , sometimes referred to as _",
    "pik s law _",
    "after @xcite ; an equivalent form uses the orbital separation of the components @xmath18 .",
    "this empirical law breaks down both at very short orbital periods @xcite , and at large orbital separations @xcite , where the binary frequency is found to drop .",
    "the observed distribution of _ wide binaries _ is of particular interest , because the low binding energy of these systems makes them susceptible to disruption .",
    "theoretical models suggest that marginally bound systems in the galactic disk will dissolve over timescales comparable with the age of the galaxy through repeated , separate encounters with field stars , giant molecular clouds , or hypothetical dark matter bodies @xcite .",
    "since the probability of a system to become disrupted increases with component separation , it is expected that an evolved population of wide binaries will exhibit a break in its distribution at large orbital separations .",
    "hence even a population whose initial distribution strictly following pik s law ( @xmath18 ) will end up with a truncated distribution , with @xmath19 breaking down to a steeper power law ( @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) beyond some orbital separation limit .",
    "the specific form of @xmath19 will be a function of both the age and interaction history of the binary population under study",
    ". samples of wide binaries can thus be used as probes of the environments of various populations of objects . to investigate these statistical effects",
    ", it is however desirable to assemble _ large samples _ of wide binary systems .",
    "much can also be learned by assembling and comparing samples drawn from a variety of populations and stellar subtypes @xcite .",
    "the classical method to find wide binaries is to search for pairs of stars with small angular separations on the sky .",
    "the main problem is to distinguish between _ physical pairs _ ,",
    "i.e. genuine resolved binary stars , and _ optical pairs _ , which are chance alignments of unrelated stars along the line of sight .",
    "while all physical binaries should ultimately be confirmed through the detection of their orbital motion , this is generally impractical for wide binaries with orbital periods of @xmath22 years or longer .",
    "wide binaries are thus generally identified based of probability arguments .",
    "besides angular separations , other observables are useful is assessing the status of candidate wide binaries .",
    "parallax measurements are perhaps the most useful , when they exist ; orbital separations are expected to be @xmath23 pc , so both component should have very nearly identical parallaxes .",
    "wide binaries are also expected to have orbital velocities @xmath24 km s@xmath1 , so their radial velocities should be nearly identical , as well as their proper motion vectors . while radial velocities are efficient at separating out physical and optical pairs at any distance range , parallaxes and proper motions are most useful at small radial distances , where their relative accuracies are higher .",
    "one identifies in the literature two distinct approaches in identifying wide binaries .",
    "one approach attempts to identify distant wide binaries in deep imaging surveys using statical arguments based on angular separations alone .",
    "a classical example is the two - point correlation method elaborated by @xcite .",
    "their analysis of deep images of north galactic pole demonstrated an excess of pairs with small angular separations , compared to what one would expect from a random distribution of single stars .",
    "radial velocity measurements have been used to confirm the binary status of the candidates @xcite .",
    "this , and other similar surveys @xcite , have however yielded only limited samples of wide binaries .",
    "the second , more successful , approach is based on a search for wide binaries among catalogs of stars with large proper motions . in such catalogs ,",
    "wide binaries are expected to be found as _",
    "common proper motion _ ( cpm ) doubles .",
    "this method has been expanded to a considerable extent by w. j. @xcite .",
    "his _ lds catalogue _ @xcite , contains over 6,200 wide binaries , with proper motions @xmath25 yr@xmath1 . searching for wide binaries among high proper motion stars has several advantages .",
    "such stars tend to be relatively nearby ( @xmath26 pc ) , which means that wide binaries with orbital separations as small as @xmath27 au will generally be resolved in most imaging surveys , including archived photographic plate .",
    "the proximity of the high proper motion population also makes it easier to identify _ intrinsically faint _ companions , such as m dwarfs or brown dwarfs .",
    "high proper motion stars are also generally within range of accurate parallax measurements , which ultimately provide the most stringent test of the binary star status of the components .    unfortunately , a complete catalog of all the high proper motion stars surveyed for cpm companions was never published by luyten , leaving no data on the parent population . in particular , it must be emphasized that the lds catalog is not a subsample of the _ nltt catalog _ @xcite ; the nltt catalog compiles only the fastest stars identified by luyten ( @xmath28 yr@xmath1 ) and @xmath29 of the lds pairs have proper motions below the nltt limit",
    ". other limitations of both the lds and nltt catalogs include ( 1 ) a limited precision in the tabulated proper motions @xcite which leaves significant uncertainties on some of the pairings , and ( 2 ) a photographic magnitude system ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) which does not yield reliable photometric distances for red dwarfs @xcite .",
    "both the lds and nltt catalogs also suffer from incompleteness , particularly in areas of high stellar densities such as in milky way fields , and also at faint ( @xmath32 ) magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , the lds and nltt catalogs still provide ample opportunities to conduct additional surveys and analyses of wide binary systems , and one can argue that they have remained under - utilized in this respect . a successful use of the luyten catalogs is demonstrated by @xcite , who surveyed a well - defined sample of @xmath33 high proper motion objects , identifying and analyzing 122 cpm companions .    a more systematic search for wide binaries using the luyten catalogs was made possible with the release of the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) assembled by @xcite .",
    "the rnltt is based on the re - identification of nltt stars in the usno - a catalog @xcite and in the 2mass _ second incremental release _",
    "this fixed some of the main limitations of the nltt by providing significantly more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes .",
    "additionally , the new optical - to - infrared colors make it possible to separate out white dwarfs , disk dwarfs , and halo subdwarfs in a reduced proper motion diagram @xcite . a complete analysis of the rnltt yielded an expanded list of 1124 cpm doubles @xcite , including clearly defined samples of wide binaries from both the local disk and local halo populations .",
    "these samples suggest that the distribution in orbital separations in both disk and halo wide binaries is consistent with a power law distribution of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 , significantly different from pik s law ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting cpm doubles are those for which at least one component is a star listed in the _ hipparcos _ catalog . a systematic search of both the nltt and rnltt by @xcite  hereafter gc04  has yielded 424 such pairs .",
    "the identification of a distant , faint companion to a _ hipparcos _",
    "star automatically yields a high - quality parallax for the faint secondary , which can be critical in mapping the color - magnitude relationship of low - luminosity stars @xcite .",
    "but perhaps the most interesting feature for the investigation of wide binaries is that an accurate parallax also yields an accurate measurement of the projected _ physical separation _ between the two components , which can be more directly compared with theoretical models .    the new lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motion @xmath0",
    "yr@xmath1 @xcite now provides a fresh opportunity to expand the census of cpm doubles , including systems with _ hipparcos",
    "_ primaries .",
    "the lspm - north catalog is based on a re - analysis of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) with the superblink software , which used an image - subtraction algorithm to achieve a high detection rate for stars with significant proper motions .",
    "the catalog covers the entire hemisphere north of the j2000 celestial equator ( decl.@xmath370 ) .",
    "it is is estimated to be @xmath38 complete over the entire northern sky down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 . in fields at high galactic latitude ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "its completeness is @xmath41 .",
    "the lspm - north also has a lower proper motion limit than the nltt catalog ( 0.15@xmath42 yr@xmath1 , compared with 0.18@xmath42 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "nearly half ( 30,616 ) of its 61,977 recorded high proper motion stars are not listed in the nltt . just like the rnltt",
    ", the lspm - north provides more accurate positions , proper motions , and magnitudes , and also gives optical - to - infrared colors .    in paper",
    "i , we demonstrated the potential for using the superblink database to find new cpm companions , reporting the discovery of 5 new companions of known nearby stars @xcite . in this second paper , we capitalize on the very high completeness of the lspm - north to obtain a statistically complete census of faint cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "our methodology for identifying cpm doubles is described in  2 , our resulting census of cpm pairs is presented in  3 and 4 , a statistically complete sample of wide binaries is defined and analyzed in  5 , the main results are summarized in the conclusion (  6 ) .",
    "common proper motion ( cpm ) doubles are , by definition , resolved pairs of stars which have similar proper motions , both in magnitude and orientation .",
    "they typically have angular separations ranging from several arcseconds to several arcminutes .",
    "they are assumed to be the resolved components of wide binary systems .",
    "as such , they are also expected to orbit around their common center of mass and display orbital motion .",
    "cpm doubles are thus not expected to have _ identical _ proper motion vectors , since the orbital motion will result in a small relative proper motion between the components of the pair . in most cases , however , the orbital period will be large enough ( @xmath43 yr ) that the relative proper motion between the stars will be negligible on timescales of years to decades .",
    "modern proper motion measurements will thus be comparable to within the measurement errors .",
    "pairs of high proper motion stars resulting from a chance alignment , on the other hand , will generally have different proper motions , although there remains a small probability that a few will , by chance , also have similar proper motions ( although they may lie at very different distances ) .",
    "the formal identification of a cpm pair as a wide binary thus requires one to weight in the probability for a common proper motion pair to be a chance alignment .",
    "consider two stars at angular positions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 refers to the right ascension and @xmath47 to the declination on the sky .",
    "these stars have proper motions @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for small angles of separation between stars 1 and 2",
    ", we can approximate the angular separation @xmath50 between the stars as : @xmath51 we can also define @xmath52 as the magnitude of the difference between the proper motion vectors : @xmath53 each pair can thus be represented in a ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space . for large numbers of pairs , one",
    "can then statistically determine the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment by comparing the actual distribution of pairs in the ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space with a model of the distribution expected from chance alignments .",
    "the expected distribution of chance alignments in ( @xmath50,@xmath52 ) phase space is very hard to modelize analytically for a proper motion catalog such as the lspm - north .",
    "one complication is that the distribution of high proper motion stars is not uniform in @xmath46 and @xmath47 with some regions of the sky being more densely populated that others @xcite .",
    "the distribution in proper motions @xmath54 is also not uniform .",
    "proper motion vectors have preferred orientations in some parts of the sky , most notably because of the asymmetric drift of thick disk and halo stars , as well as from the solar motion relative to the local standard of rest , both effects resulting in preferred orientations of the proper motion vectors in specific parts of the sky .",
    "also , the density of objects increases as the proper motion decreases , with very high proper motion stars being rare and low proper motion stars more common .",
    "it is however possible to obtain an empirical model of the density of chance alignments in @xmath50,@xmath52 phase space .",
    "one can picture the calculation of all the @xmath50 as a comparison between the positions of all stars in two sets of objects : set # 1 with positions @xmath44 , and set # 2 with positions @xmath45 .",
    "we calculate the angular distance separating each individual object in set # 2 from each individual object in set # 1 .",
    "assuming there are @xmath55 objects in set # 1 and @xmath56 objects in set # 2 , then we have @xmath57 pairings .",
    "what we are interested in is the special case where the primary star is a _ hipparcos _",
    "set # 1 is thus the subset of lspm - north stars with a _ hipparcos _",
    "counterpart ( 4,839 objects ) , while subset # 2 comprises the entire lspm - north catalog ( 61,976 objects ) .",
    "it is possible to modify the dataset and simulate a situation where no genuine cpm pairs would be found , only chance alignments .",
    "let s redefine the angular separation @xmath50 as : @xmath58_{sim}= ( ( \\alpha_1-[\\alpha_2-\\theta])^{2 }    \\cos{(\\delta_1)}^{2}+(\\delta_1-\\delta_2)^{2 } ) ^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] this is equivalent to displacing all stars in set # 2 by an angle @xmath59 in the direction of right ascension , prior to calculating angular separations .",
    "this procedure effectively eliminates all pairings of genuine cpm doubles ( since the second star of the pair is now moved out the way by some angular distance @xmath59 ) while leaving intact the statistics of the chance alignments .",
    "the procedure can be illustrated with a ballroom analogy .",
    "imagine a crowd of men and women attending a dance function in a large ballroom .",
    "assume that a few of the attendees are married couples , while the rest are singles .",
    "let s say initially all the dancers are scattered around the ballroom at random , but with all the married couples holding hands .",
    "people would be found in pairs , some because they are married couples , but other simply by chance . at a specified time",
    ", an announcer commands all the men to walk ten steps to their right .",
    "after this , new pairings of people would have been made , but this time none of them would be married couples , all would be chance pairings . if we were to calculate how many pairs there were initially , and subtract out the number of pairs after the move , then we would have a good estimate of how many married couples are attending the dance .",
    "the distribution of all pairs in the @xmath60,@xmath52 thus effectively simulates a distribution of pairs in the lspm - north catalog _ as if there were no cpm doubles in it_. the displacement angle @xmath59 should be large enough that all cpm doubles are well separated , i.e. , larger than the typical angular separation between cpm pairs .",
    "however , @xmath59 should not be too large because we need to simulate pairing made within areas of the sky that have similar densities and proper motion systematics .",
    "we use values of @xmath59 between 1 and 5 degrees .    in figure 1",
    ", we compare the distribution in @xmath50,@xmath52 phase space for lspm - north pairs with distributions of pairs in the simulated @xmath60,@xmath52 phase space .",
    "the left panels show the distribution of pairs with _ hipparcos _",
    "primaries , while the right panels shows simulations calculated with @xmath59 = 1 degree .",
    "the distributions are split in three different groups , depending on the mean proper motion @xmath61 of the pairs , @xmath62yr@xmath63yr@xmath1 ( top ) , @xmath64yr@xmath65yr@xmath1 ( middle ) , and @xmath66yr@xmath67yr@xmath1 ( bottom ) .",
    "the panels to the right display the results of the chance alignment simulations ( i.e. with set # 2 translated by an angle @xmath59 ) , and for comparable ranges of @xmath61 .",
    "the most striking difference between the data and the simulations are the number of pairs found in the lower left corner of each diagram , corresponding to small angular separations _ and _ small proper motion differences .",
    "very few pairs are found in the simulations , but the data shows a large concentration of objects in that range .",
    "this concentration of objects in the data can only be interpreted as the signature from a population of common proper motion binaries .",
    "pairs of stars found in that region of the parameter space are thus most likely to be genuine physical doubles .",
    "the density of chance alignments , however , progressively increases for larger values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "there exists a limit beyond which the density of chance alignment pairs exceeds that of the cpm doubles .",
    "this limit can be used to objectively define a search area for wide binary systems .",
    "the distribution of high proper motion stars is locally uniform in @xmath68 , so the probability of having a chance alignment , for small values of @xmath50 , is directly proportional to @xmath50 . on first order",
    ", one also expects the probability of a chance alignment to increase proportionally to @xmath52 , again for small values of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for small values of both @xmath50 and @xmath52 the probability of a chance alignment is expected to be proportional to @xmath69 . in the lspm - north catalog ,",
    "the distribution of high proper motion stars empirically follows n(@xmath61)d@xmath70d@xmath61 , where @xmath71 . from that",
    ", we infer that the number density of chance alignments @xmath72 in @xmath73 phase space must follow : @xmath74 for small values of @xmath50 and @xmath52 .    to determine the range within which a data pair is most likely to be a cpm double",
    ", we define the variable : @xmath75^{0.5},\\ ] ] which includes a normalization of the proper motions to the lower limit of the lspm - north catalog ( 0.15@xmath42 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "this new variable is deliberately set up so that the number density of chance alignment pairs increases _ linearly _ with @xmath76 ( hence the square root in eq .",
    "this helps in modelizing the contribution from chance alignments , whose density should increase linearly with @xmath77 .",
    "we compare the number density distribution of pairs @xmath78 in the data with the mean distribution of simulated , chance alignment pairs @xmath79 , averaged from 20 different simulations .",
    "the result is displayed in figure 2 . for small values of @xmath76 ,",
    "corresponding to small angular distances @xmath50 and/or small differences in proper motion @xmath52 , one finds that @xmath80 , which means that there is a high probability for any pair found in that range to be a cpm double .",
    "we find that @xmath72 increases linearly with @xmath76 , as expected , while @xmath81 steadfastly decreases when @xmath76 increases , up to a point where @xmath72 begins to dominate .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 2 estimates the probability for a pair to be a chance alignment , as a function of the variable @xmath76 .",
    "we find that beyond @xmath82 the probability of a pair to be a chance alignment exceeds 50% .",
    "we thus use @xmath82 as the upper limit in our search for cpm doubles .",
    "we select as wide binary candidate any pair for which @xmath83 , which is equivalent to selecting pairs which satisfy the condition : @xmath84 where @xmath50 is expressed in seconds of arc , and @xmath52 is in seconds of arc per year .",
    "the location of this boundary is illustrated in figure 1 for @xmath85yr@xmath1 ( top ) , @xmath86yr@xmath1 ( middle ) , and @xmath87yr@xmath1 ( bottom ) .",
    "note that the boundary is a function of the mean proper motion ( @xmath61 ) of the pair , which means that pairs with large proper motions are selected over a larger range in @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "the boundary rises to high values of @xmath52 at very small angular separations , setting an unrealistically high limit for the detection of wide binaries , whose proper motions should be very similar in any case .",
    "we thus add the following constraint : @xmath88 this large , arbitrary limit ensures that no pairs with very different proper motions will make the cut , even if they happen to have very small angular separations .",
    "the majority of pairs found in the lspm - north are at distances @xmath89pc , and have projected separations @xmath90au ( see  3,4 below ) ; a difference in proper motion @xmath91mas would imply an orbital velocity @xmath92 km s@xmath1 which would be unrealistically large for any system with @xmath90au .",
    "we also set an upper limit to the range of angular separations : @xmath93 this limits the search to a reasonable range in @xmath50 . beyond this limit ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath52 from eq.7 become so stringent that the allowed range in @xmath52 falls well below the measurement errors , thus losing all practicality .",
    "the search area bounded by eqs.6,7,8 should include the vast majority of genuine wide binaries , with minimal contamination from chance alignment pairs . a small level of contamination is still expected , particularly for pairs selected near the boundaries .",
    "based on our simulations of chance alignments , we estimate the contamination in the entire search area to be @xmath94 pairs , or @xmath95 of the total sample .",
    "using the selection method discussed above , we searched the lspm - north catalog for cpm binaries in which both the primary and secondary ( and tertiary ) are _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "we identified a total of 168 such cpm pairs with angular separations @xmath96 , arranged into 158 doubles and 5 triples .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution in @xmath73 for the 163 systems selected as most likely to be wide binaries / multiples ( open and filled circles ) .",
    "fig.3 also shows the @xmath73 distribution of pairs that did not fall within our selection limits , and thus identified as most likely to be chance alignments ( open and filled triangles ) .",
    "these pairs of _ hipparcos _ stars make an excellent case study for our wide binary search algorithm because the _ hipparcos _ catalog provides accurate and independent measurements of their parallaxes , which allow us to verify if the two components indeed physically associated .",
    "overall , we find that all except 2 of the pair have the parallax of the primary and secondary within 2.0@xmath97 of the measurement errors . for the 2 pairs with mismatched distances , we can only conclude that they are chance alignments .",
    "these pairs are represented in fig.3 a open circles ( bottom panel ) .",
    "one of the rejected pairs is formed of lspm j0722 + 0849s ( hip 35756 ) and lspm j0722 + 0854 ( hip 35750 ) , and has an angular separation of 302@xmath42 .",
    "the alleged primary has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath98mas , while the secondary has @xmath99mas .",
    "the two parallax measurements are thus significantly different .",
    "we note that the difference in proper motion @xmath52 is also substantial , and it is thus not a surprise that the two should come out as chance alignments .",
    "the pair was initially selected by our algorithm is mainly because of the relatively large proper motion of the two stars ( @xmath100 yr@xmath1 ) , which makes this alignment a rare event given the relative scarcity of stars with very large proper motions .",
    "this pair was similarly identified as a chance alignment by @xcite .",
    "the other rejected pair consists of lspm j1826 + 0846 ( hip 90355 ) and lspm j1826 + 0836 ( hip 90365 ) , with an angular separation of 608@xmath42 .",
    "the first star has a _ hipparcos _ parallax @xmath101mas , while the second star has a parallax @xmath102mas .",
    "again , the large difference between the two values indicates that the two are physically unrelated . here",
    ", however , it comes out more as a surprise because the two stars have proper motion vectors within only 4 mas yr@xmath1 of each other .",
    "this striking alignment of both angular positions and proper motion vectors serves as a good warning about the possibility of having physically unrelated stars come up as apparent cpm doubles .",
    "we also examined all pairs rejected in the initial cut , and with angular separations @xmath103 , to see if additional cpm binaries could be recovered based on their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "this is one way to check that the algorithm does a good job at picking out most of the genuine wide binaries .",
    "an examination of the parallaxes of the primaries and secondaries in 55 pairs with @xmath104 ( all rejected on the first pass ) reveals the existence of two pairs that are indeed consistent with being cpm doubles .",
    "more specifically , the parallaxes of the individual components in each of these pairs are consistent with the two stars being at the same distance . in each of them , the parallaxes of both",
    "the primary and secondary are better than 10% accurate , and the difference between the parallax of the primary and secondary was smaller than the quoted measurement error .",
    "we have added these two pairs to our list of cpm doubles . in fig.3 , they are plotted as filled triangles .",
    "note that both pairs have fairly small difference in their proper motion , which is also consistent with the components forming physical pairs .",
    "one of the two very wide pairs is composed of the @xmath105 star hip 53791 with the @xmath106 star hip 53756 at a separation @xmath107 .",
    "the two stars have @xmath108 parallaxes @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the second pair consists of the @xmath111 star hip 75104 with the @xmath112 star hip 75011 .",
    "the very large separation between the two components ( @xmath113 ) raises suspicion about their physical association , but the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes are a near perfect match , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a distance of 44",
    "pc , the projected physical separation between the two components would be @xmath116 au .",
    "it is interesting to note that the 2 genuine doubles found among the 55 pairs that were initially rejected suggest that a few percent of the pairs rejected in our search algorithm are likely to be true doubles .",
    "this emphasizes the limitations of our statistical method in making a complete identification of wide cpm doubles , especially of those with very large angular separations . \"",
    "table 1 gives a list of the 158 doubles and 5 triples ultimately selected as wide binary systems .",
    "the table give the lspm catalog number of the primary ( column 1 ) , the _ hipparcos _ catalog number of the primary ( 2 ) , its right ascension ( 3 ) , its declination ( 4 ) , its proper motion in the direction or r.a . and in @xmath42 yr@xmath1 ( 5 ) , its proper motion in the direction of decl .",

    "the short separation pair is listed in table 1 .",
    "the large separation component is listed in a pair with the brightest component of the short separation pair .",
    "each triple is thus referenced as one short period pair and one long period pair .",
    "we find that of the 158 doubles and 5 triples reported here , only 80 of the doubles ( and none of the triples ) had been previously reported in gc04 .",
    "a little more than half the systems in our list are thus `` new '' cpm systems .",

    "note that several pairs with separations @xmath120 are found to have relative proper motions @xmath121 ; this is an artifact of the lspm - north catalog .",
    "the proper motions listed in the lspm - north are based on proper motion measurements of the stars in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , derived with the superblink software @xcite .",
    "the dss images are scans from the poss - i and poss - ii photographic plates .",
    "companions of _ hipparcos _ stars with separations @xmath122 are generally found within the extended wings of the bright stars , which are deeply saturated on the dss images . in those instances",
    "superblink identifies the mingled pair as a single extended , moving object , and calculates a proper motion for the pair only .",
    "the individual components are usually recovered by visual inspection of either the dss scans or 2mass charts .",
    "but even though the stars appear on separate entries in the lspm - north , the catalog lists the superblink - calculated proper motion of the _ pair _ for both the primary and secondary . since",
    "their proper motions are listed as exactly the same , one gets @xmath121 for those pairs .",
    "we have verified each of those pairs individually using our superblink - generated finding charts , and confirmed that in every case the two stars do indeed have very similar proper motions , so it is very unlikely that any of those pairs could be chance alignments , and their initial identification as cpm doubles is valid .      because we lack parallax measurements for the non-_hipparcos _ secondaries , it is not possible to verify the binary status of these pairs by direct comparison of their measured distances , as we did in  3 .",
    "another test , however , is to check that the color and magnitude of the secondary is at least consistent with the star being at the same distance from the sun as its primary .",
    "this is equivalent to comparing the parallax distance of the primary with the photometric distance of the secondary . we can plot the secondary star in a color - magnitude diagram , using the parallax of the _ primary star _ to calculate its alleged absolute magnitude .",
    "if the two stars are indeed physically associated , then the secondary should fall on the standard main sequence , or on the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "if the secondary stars does nt fall where it should be on the color magnitude diagram , then either the secondary is really not at the same distance from the sun as the primary , and the pair is a chance alignment , or the secondary star has an absolute magnitude which does nt fit with the standard stellar loci .",
    "color magnitude diagrams for the primaries and secondaries are displayed in figure 5 . in these diagrams ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes of both the primaries and secondaries are calculated using the parallaxes of the _ hipparcos _ primary stars .",
    "the diagrams are built in the ( v , v - j ) system of visual magnitude and optical - to - infrared color , a system most useful for displaying the cool end of the main sequence and perhaps the most appropriate for our sample of secondary stars , which is dominated by cool red dwarfs .",
    "secondaries found in the immediate vicinity of bright _ hipparcos _ stars often suffer from large measurement errors in their optical v magnitudes , which are derived from poss plate measurements .",
    "for that reason , we separate the secondaries into two distinct groups , those with angular separations @xmath123 and those with @xmath124 .",
    "the color - magnitude test is expected to fail for many of the closer pairs because of possible large errors in their estimated v magnitude .",
    "fortunately , pairs with small separations have a very low probability of being chance alignments , so it is safe to assume that they are physically associated , in any case .",
    "figure 5 shows color - magnitude diagrams for the primaries ( top ) , the close @xmath123 secondaries ( middle ) , and the wide @xmath124 secondaries ( bottom ) .",
    "the figure also plots in diagrams in two separate columns , comparing the pairs with _ hipparcos _ secondaries from  2 ( left ) with the pairs with non- _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( right ) .",
    "overall , we find that the majority of the secondaries fall close to either the main sequence or the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "a pair of dotted lines delimitates a the region where stars are within 1.5 mag of the standard main sequence ( upper right in the diagram ) as determined from a fit of nearby stars with known trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",
    "a second pair of lines identifies the region within 1.5 mag of the standard white dwarf sequence based on the distribution of nearby white dwarfs with known trigonometric parallaxes ( lpine 2006 , in preparation ) .",

    "secondaries , the @xmath124 companions have a mean position of only 0.01 mag above the main sequence with a @xmath125 dispersion of 0.39 mag ; the only clear outlier ( at m@xmath126=1.27 , v - j=1.97 ) is the star hip 64522 = hd 115061 , a known giant star .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "secondaries with @xmath123 , one the other hand , have many more clear outliers .",
    "if we disregard all the secondaries that are off the main sequence by more than 3 magnitudes , we still find that the companions lie on average 0.42 mag above the main sequence , with a dispersion of 0.95 mag .",
    "this larger dispersion suggests that the magnitudes and colors of the closer companions carry large uncertainties , and the 0.42 mag offset even suggests possible systematic errors .",
    "likewise the magnitudes and colors of the non-_hipparcos _ secondaries are clearly more scattered around the main sequence for companions with ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "even if we exclude the 3-magnitude outliers , we find that the close secondaries are on average 0.11 mag below the main sequence with a dispersion of 1.33 mag .",
    "companions with @xmath124 have a mean offset of 0.05 mag with a significantly smaller dispersion of only 0.45 mag .",
    "we conclude that the colors and magnitudes of the short separation pairs ( @xmath123 ) are not reliable enough to be useful for a photometric distance comparison . for the large separation pairs ( @xmath124 ) , however , the colors and magnitudes are accurate enough to use the photometric distance of the secondary as a confirmation that the two components are physically related .",
    "it is clear from fig.5 that several of the wide secondaries do fail the test .",
    "the lower - right panel shows several secondaries that are outliers of both the red dwarf and white dwarf sequences .",
    "we identify a total of 20 pairs with mismatched companions ; these are listed separately in table 3 .",
    "nine of these uncertain secondaries are found lying @xmath127 magnitudes above the standard main sequence .",
    "one possible explanation is that these secondaries are actually foreground red dwarfs in chance alignments with background _",
    "hipparcos _ stars .",
    "another possibility is that these secondaries are actually unresolved double stars ( in which case these would really be triple systems ) .",
    "an unresolved pair of stars with components of similar color and absolute magnitude will appear 0.75 mag brighter than a single star of the same type . reducing the absolute magnitudes of those `` overluminous '' secondaries by 0.75 mag , to account for unresolved companions , would bring them back within range of the standard main sequence .",
    "the binary status of these stars should be verified through either high angular resolution imaging @xcite or radial velocity monitoring @xcite .",
    "the remaining 11 `` uncertain '' companions are found lying between the main sequence and white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that these stars are background red dwarfs in chance alignments with foreground _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "they could also be foreground white dwarfs in chance alignments with background _",
    "hipparcos _ stars .",
    "another possibility , however , is that these secondaries are red subdwarfs .",
    "red subdwarfs are the metal - poor counterparts of the main sequence red dwarfs ; in the color magnitude diagram , the subdwarf sequence is found to the left ( blueward ) of the main sequence @xcite .",
    "this is because lower metallicities result in lower atomic and molecular opacities in the optical bands , shifting the spectral energy distribution to the blue @xcite . in the ( m@xmath126,v - j ) color - magnitude diagram , red subdwarfs",
    "are expected to fall between the main sequence and the white dwarf sequence .",
    "a simple kinematic test can be applied to check if a star is a good subdwarf candidate . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "subdwarfs generally exist as high - velocity stars .",
    "this is because local metal - poor stars are usually members of the galactic halo or thick disk @xcite . in figure 6",
    ", we plot the projected , transverse velocities v@xmath128 of our cpm doubles , against their angular separation @xmath50 .",
    "the top panel shows pairs which have secondaries that consistently fall on the main sequence when placed at the primary s distance ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the uncertain pairs , including those for which the secondaries are suspected to be subdwarfs ( using the same symbols as in fig.5 ) .",
    "we find only one pair with a transverse velocity which clearly associate it with the halo population .",
    "this is the pair whose primary is the star hip 35756 ( g 89 - 14 ) a known spectroscopic double @xcite .",
    "although its parallax is fairly uncertain ( @xmath129 ) , g 89 - 14 has long been known to be a metal - poor subdwarf , with log(fe / h)@xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the relatively small angular separation to the secondary ( @xmath131 ) further argues in favor of this pair being a physical double ( or rather triple , since the _ hipparcos _ primary is itself an unresolved double ) .",
    "indeed , this cpm multiple had already been identified as a physical pair by @xcite , in their search for wide binaries among known metal poor stars .",
    "the primaries of the remaining 10 objects , on the other hand , have kinematics more consistent with the disk population , which makes the alleged secondaries unlikely to be subdwarfs .",
    "for the 4 pairs with the largest separations @xmath132 , a good case can be made that they are most likely to be chance alignments .",
    "the situation is not so clear for the 6 other pairs , which have @xmath133 : the proximity of the components argues against simple chance alignments .",
    "either these stars have large errors in their magnitudes , or they are most likely to be subdwarfs .",
    "the subdwarf status of the alleged cpm companions should be checked more directly through spectroscopic measurements .",
    "metallicity effects can be diagnosed in optical spectra from the ratio of the tio and cah bandstrengths @xcite .",
    "if both the primary and secondary have spectra consistent with a low metallicity object ( i.e. if they are both spectroscopic subdwarfs ) then they are most likely to be actual physical doubles .",
    "if on the other hand , the stars are both found to be regular dwarfs , then the pair must be a chance alignment . if one component is found to be a dwarf and the other a subdwarf",
    ", then it would also strongly suggest that the pair is a chance alignment , since one would expect cpm doubles to have similar chemical compositions .",
    "given the angular separation limits of our search algorithm , we do expect to be overlooking genuine wide binaries with very large angular separations .",
    "the range of our search actually depends on the proper motion of the pair .",
    "for instance , pairs with a mean proper motion @xmath134 yr@xmath1 and proper motion differences @xmath135 mas yr@xmath1 will not make it into the sample if @xmath136 .",
    "proper motions in the lspm - north catalog have a mean error of 8 mas @xmath1 , which at first guess suggests typical proper motion differences @xmath13711.3 mas @xmath1 , for cpm binaries .",
    "the actual errors in @xmath52 are probably somewhat smaller , because part of the 8 mas @xmath1 proper motion errors in the lspm - north are due to systematic errors , which affect both stars in a cpm pair equally , and these systematic errors subtract out in @xmath52 . in any case",
    ", we conservatively adopt 11.3 mas @xmath1 as the mean error in @xmath52 , and place a 3-@xmath97 limit at @xmath138 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "since this is larger than our adopted detection limits at large separations , we conclude that it is likely that at least a few genuine pairs have been rejected by our search algorithm .",
    "a look at fig.4 ( bottom panel ) shows a handful of pairs with angular separations @xmath139 and relative proper motions @xmath140 mas yr@xmath1 ( dashed line ) that were not selected by our algorithm .",
    "while these pairs still have a fairly high probability of being chance alignments , we can not exclude the possibility that a significant fraction of them are wide binaries .",
    "assuming that all the pairs with @xmath140mas yr@xmath1 are actually wide binaries , we calculate that these would represent only @xmath141 of the total pairs found .",
    "hence we are confident that our census must be at least @xmath142 complete up to @xmath143 . beyond that limit",

    "the lspm - north proper motions yield a @xmath146 mas yr@xmath1 for that pair , well inside our own detection range .",
    "the other 21 pairs , however , have @xmath147 and @xmath52 within the selection limits of gc04 , and it remains unclear why they were not included in their list .    within the limits of our search area ( the northern sky ) , we found only 4 pairs in the gc04 list that were not picked up by our search algorithm .",

    "it is possible that some of these pairs , and other pairs rejected in our algorithm , might be genuine physical doubles , particularly those that just barely fell off the selection limit .",
    "overall , we find that our own census recovers essentially all the gc04 pairs , and adds a significant number of new objects .",
    "the improvement clearly comes from the use of the more complete lspm - north catalog .",

    "the large apparent magnitude of the _ hipparcos _ primaries and their deep saturation on photographic survey plates hampers our detection of companions with small angular separations . since the lspm - north is based on analyses of digitized sky survey scans of poss - i and poss - ii , this is a severe limitation because _ hipparcos _ stars are deeply saturated on poss - i plates . for pairs where only one component is a _",

    "some companions in the lspm - north have been resolved from 2mass images , but this is possible only for relatively bright companions , in any case much brighter than the @xmath39 catalog limit .",
    "pairs for which both components are _ hipparcos _ stars are not limited in the same way , because the lspm - north uses the _ hipparcos _ catalog itself as input for the brighter stars .",
    "all pairs with @xmath150 should be resolved in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "we can thus use the statistically complete distribution in angular separations of the _ hipparcos_+ _ hipparcos _ pairs to estimate the incompleteness of our census for pairs with faint secondaries .",
    "figure 7 plots the projected orbital separations @xmath151 of the pairs as a function of their distance @xmath152 ( estimated from the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xmath153 ) .",
    "note that our systems tend to be relatively nearby , with most of the pairs lying at distances 20 - 100 parsec .",
    "the fact that fewer pairs are detected at larger distances is the result of proper motion selection effects . because of the lower limit @xmath0 yr@xmath1 of the lspm - north , stars with low transverse velocities",
    "are increasingly left out of the sample at larger distances @xcite .",
    "the number of detected systems hence reaches a maximum around @xmath154 pc .",
    "what is also apparent in fig.7 is the dominance of pairs @xmath155 in the hip+hip systems .",
    "in contrast , pairs for which only the primary is a _ hipparcos _",

    "our census of systems with faint secondaries is thus clearly undersampled in pairs with @xmath155 .",
    "this is largely consistent with our prediction that secondaries with small angular separations would be lost in the glare of their bright primaries .",
    "we conclude that our census is thus statistically complete only over the range @xmath157 .    while our census spans only 1.3 orders of magnitude in @xmath50 , we are actually sensitive to a larger range of projected orbital separations @xmath158 because our sample covers systems over a relatively large range of distances .",
    "since our pairs are found in a range of distances 15 pc@xmath159100 pc , our effective sampling range for wide companions is between 300 au and 30,000 au .",
    "it is worth noting that this extends beyond the canonical upper limit @xmath160 pc (= 20,000 au ) for wide binary systems @xcite .",
    "our sample actually suggests the existence of wide binaries with @xmath161 pc . our widest binary system is the pair composed of hip 64157 and the faint high proper motion star lspm j1308 + 3332 (= nltt 33016 ) , which have an angular separation @xmath162 and are located at a distance @xmath163 pc , which yields an orbital separation @xmath164au .",

    "we show distinct plots for _ hipparcos _ secondaries ( top ) and non-_hipparcos _ secondaries ( bottom ) .",
    "the secondaries are clearly dominated by stars with @xmath168 , in other words by m dwarfs .",
    "since most of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are g dwarfs , with @xmath169 , it is clear that there is no general tendency for the secondaries to be of similar masses as their primaries .",
    "the secondaries , in fact , look like they could have been drawn from the field population of single stars ( see however  5.3 below ) .    the magnitude limit of the lspm - north catalog yields a limiting absolute magnitude which is dependent on the distance of the pair .",
    "the majority of our pairs are relatively close ; if we restrict our sample to objects within @xmath7 pc , then our census of faint secondaries should be complete down to @xmath170 .",
    "this happens to be just beyond the peak in the luminosity function of low - mass red dwarfs @xcite .",
    "assuming the luminosity function of the secondaries to be roughly similar to that of field stars , then our census should be missing only a relatively small fraction of the hydrogen - burning secondaries . in any case",
    ", our detection of several very nearby ( @xmath171 pc ) secondaries with @xmath172 suggests that several very - low mass companions remain to be discovered at larger distances . to be detected",
    ", these will require catalogs of high proper motion stars with significantly fainter magnitude limits .",
    "a close examination of the distribution in the absolute magnitude of the cpm secondaries shows a deficit of low - luminosity objects ( @xmath173 ) compared with the field luminosity function .",
    "figure 9 shows the @xmath166 distribution for the primaries and secondaries in our sample .",
    "we use a monte - carlo simulation to predict the magnitude distribution of the secondaries , using the assumption that both components are drawn independently from the field luminosity function .",
    "we adopt the luminosity function of main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood estimated by @xcite ; the additional contribution of the white dwarfs can be neglected , since they account for less than 5% of the secondaries . as shown in fig.9 ,",
    "the distribution observed for the secondaries is significantly different from the predicted one .",
    "if we adjust the simulations to match the numbers of bright ( @xmath174 ) secondaries , we find only @xmath175 of objects in the @xmath176 range predicted by the model .",
    "since our census is demonstrably complete at @xmath7 pc down to @xmath170 , the difference is significant , and rules out the idea that the luminosity function of the secondaries is comparable to the field luminosity function .    since the absolute magnitude of main sequence stars",
    "is correlated with mass , the dearth in low - luminosity objects indicates that low - mass stars are less likely to be found as cpm secondaries than they are in the field population .",
    "one simple interpretation is that the formation mechanisms for wide binaries are biased against secondaries of very low mass or , equivalently , that they are biased in favor of high - mass secondaries .",
    "another possible interpretation is that wide binaries are formed initially with both components drawn from the same mass function , but that gravitational interactions with the environment disrupt a number of systems over time , in events that favor the disruption of systems with low - mass secondaries .",
    "in fact , if we assume that both components in wide binaries initially follow the field luminosity function , then the ratio between the observed ( or `` current '' ) and predicted ( `` initial '' ) luminosity function ( fig.9 ) shows a trend that suggest that the lower the mass of the secondary , the higher the probability for the wide system to have been disrupted over time .",
    "should this interpretation be correct , then one should expect to find very few faint companions of _ hipparcos _ stars with absolute magnitudes @xmath177 . this would imply that our sample is already nearly complete for wide hydrogen - burning companions , and that very few fainter companions should be found .      from our statistically complete sample of cpm pairs with _",

    "we estimate the multiplicity fraction by comparing the number of wide binaries found in our survey to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars in the same range of position , distance , and proper motion . a search of the _ hipparcos _ catalog finds a total of 3,041 stars north of the celestial equator with proper motion @xmath0 , parallaxes @xmath179 mas , and a parallax accuracy of better than 10% .",
    "we calculate the number density of wide binaries as a function of the logarithm of the _ projected _ , orbital separation between the pairs @xmath180 , with @xmath158 expressed in au .",

    "we separate our sample into bins of 0.2 in @xmath180 .",
    "we calculate the multiplicity fraction for each bin by taking the ratio of wide binaries found in that bin to the total number of _ hipparcos _ stars which satisfy the distance detection limits for that bin , based on a range of angular separations @xmath184 . for instance , the @xmath185 bin can only comprise systems with distances between 1.4pc and 62.9pc ( see fig 7 ) . the resulting wide binary frequency distribution is shown in figure 10 .",
    "our results indicate that at least @xmath186 of all stellar systems in the solar neighborhood consist of wide binaries / multiples with separations @xmath8 au .",
    "more specifically , this conclusion is valid for systems in which the primary is a typical , nearby _ hipparcos _ star , i.e. the primary is a g dwarf with absolute magnitude @xmath187 .",
    "we try to fit the observed distribution of orbital separation with two different models previously used in the literature .",
    "first we try a model of the form used by @xcite , which modelizes the distribution over the logarithm of orbital periods @xmath188 with a gaussian : @xmath189 with @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and where @xmath193 is the total multiplicity fraction , i.e. @xmath194 . for the systems considered in this paper , in which the primary stars are mostly solar - type objects with masses @xmath195 , we calculate the following statistical relationship between the period @xmath15 and projected separation @xmath158 : @xmath196 where @xmath15 is expressed in years and @xmath158 in au .",
    "we then have : @xmath197 our attempt to fit this form to the observed distribution of projected separations is shown in fig.10 ( model a ) .",
    "our best fit does not reproduce well the form of the distribution , and predicts more objects at small separations than are actually observed .",
    "in fact , out best fit model suggests a total multiplicity fraction @xmath198 , which is much larger than the total binary fraction estimated by @xcite . we take this as evidence that this particular form is inadequate in the range of orbital separations under consideration .",
    "our second attempt to modelize the distribution of orbital separations uses a power - law of the form : @xmath199 given that the mean projected separation in a sample of systems with random orbital plane orientations is @xmath200 , then statistically the distribution in projected separations @xmath158 also follows : @xmath201 if we plot the distribution along @xmath180 we have : @xmath202 the specific form of the equation for which @xmath36 is the well - known _ pik s law _ , and yields a distribution which is uniform in @xmath180 .",
    "we find that our data can be consistently modeled with two distinct power - law distributions over two separate ranges of orbital separations ( fig.10 , model b ) . at small projected separations ,",
    "our data are consistent with _ pik s law _ , but only up to a separation @xmath203 au . beyond that limit",
    ", the distribution shows a sudden break , and can best be fitted with a @xmath204 power index .",
    "the latter is consistent with the trends observed by @xcite for both their disk and halo samples .",
    "the flattening of the distribution below @xmath203 au , which is also hinted at in the cg04 data , is not much of a surprise since the @xmath204 power law can not possibly extend to much smaller orbital separations or the multiplicity fraction might take unphysical values .",
    "an extrapolation to @xmath205 ( @xmath206au ) , for instance , would yield a total binary fraction larger than 1 .",
    "perhaps the more significant result is not the flattening of the @xmath204 power law distribution toward small angular separations , but rather the observed break in _ pik s law _ at large angular separations .",

    "pik s law _ , then our data reveals the range of maximum extension of the law .",
    "_ pik s law",
    "_ then probably breaks down because of the disruptive effects of the environment in which the stars are born .",
    "disruption would most likely occur through interactions with neighboring stellar systems , perhaps in the very same cluster in which these systems are born .",
    "a much larger census of wide binary systems , which would yield a more detailed distribution of orbital separations , might shed more light on the processes at work in hampering the formation of extremely wide pairs .",
    "we have used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath0 yr@xmath1 to conduct a search for common proper motion ( cpm ) companions of _ hipparcos _ stars . because of the large coverage ( 20,000 square degrees ) and high completeness of the lspm - north , we have obtained a large , _ statistically complete _ census of cpm companions over the range of angular separations @xmath207 .",
    "since the lspm - north is statistically complete in high proper motion stars down to an apparent magnitude @xmath39 , our census of wide binaries is complete to a distance of 100 pc for companions with absolute magnitude @xmath178 .",
    "this high completeness yields the most thorough search for wide companions to _ hipparcos _ stars conducted to date .",
    "we find that the observed luminosity function of the faint secondaries appears to be biased against low - luminosity stars , when compared with the luminosity function of the field , single star population .",
    "most of the _ hipparcos _ primaries are f - g dwarfs with absolute magnitudes around @xmath208 .",
    "the secondaries , on the other hand , are dominated by fainter k - m dwarfs , with a range of absolute magnitude peaking at @xmath209 .",
    "while fainter , lower - mass companions clearly dominate over companions of similar masses and luminosities , one finds only half the number of faint secondaries as one would expect if both primaries and secondaries were drawn from the field luminosity function .",
    "the bias against low - mass secondaries also appears to get more severe at lower secondary masses .",
    "we further observe a distribution in the projected separations @xmath158 which is consistent with _",
    "pik s law _",
    "( @xmath210 ds ) for systems with orbital separations up to @xmath211 au . beyond that range , the frequency of wide binaries decreases according to a power law @xmath212 ds .",
    "our data thus provides clear evidence for a break in _",
    "pik s law _ at large angular separations , and we suggest that the break occurs as interactions between neighboring systems either prevents the formation of very wide binary systems or tends to disrupt them after they are formed .",
    "measurements of the distribution of orbital separations remain relatively crude .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the binary frequency , which holds the promise to provide stringent constraints on multiple star formation models , will require much larger samples of cpm pairs .",
    "at this time , we plan to first expand our census to the southern hemisphere using the upcoming lspm - south catalog ( lpine & shara , in preparation ) which will be the analog of the lspm - north for the southern declinations .",
    "this will double our census cpm pairs .",
    "the census of wide binaries should also be expanded further by extending the search to smaller proper motion regimes .",
    "such a survey of pairs of stars with low proper motions has recently been demonstrated by @xcite , who identified 705 wide binaries among stars with proper motions ( @xmath213 yr@xmath1 ) based on an analysis of the ucac2 astrometric catalog .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalog has 16,753 objects within 100 parsecs and parallaxes better than @xmath214 .",
    "however , only 6,202 of these have proper motions @xmath215 , the current range of our proper motion survey",
    ". however , 13,368 of these nearby _ hipparcos _ stars have proper motion @xmath216 , so a catalog of stars with @xmath216 would potentially double the census of wide binaries .",
    "the census could further be expanded by investigating _ hipparcos",
    "_ stars at larger recorded distances , adding up to 10,000 targets in the 100 - 200pc range",
    ".    it would also be desirable to break the low angular separation limit @xmath217 of the photographic plate - based surveys .",
    "a look at fig.7 is highly suggestive of the existence of significant numbers of faint companions with small angular separations .",
    "with ccd imaging and adaptive optics systems , it should be possible to perform a complete census of cpm companions of _ hipparcos _ stars down to angular separations of a fraction of an arcsecond",
