    "in conclusion , we discuss the controllability of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and fano resonances in hybrid bec - optomechanical system which is composed of cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) trapped inside high - finesse fabry - prot cavity driven by a single mode optical field along the cavity axis and a transverse pump field . as , the transverse optical field directly interacts with condensate mode which causes the scattering of transverse photon inside the cavity , so , by varying transverse field , we can modify the dynamics of system .",
    "we have shown the controlled behavior of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in output probe field by using transverse field .",
    "we discuss existence of single - eit window in output field of cavity - optomechanics in the absence of moving - end mirror , which means intra - cavity optical mode was only coupled to atomic mode ( bec ) of the system .",
    "the single - eit as well as double - eit windows in output probe laser field are efficiently amplified by increasing the strength of transverse optical field .",
    "furthermore , the single and double - fano resonances are discussed in out - going probe field of the system .",
    "the influence of transverse optical field is also been studied on fano resonances of the system .",
    "moreover , we have suggested a certain set of experimental parameters to observe these phenomena in laboratory .    in future , we will apply this method of control to discuss the nonlinear dynamics of hybrid system , especially to explore dynamics of interacting bose - einstein condensate in such complex systems . besides , we intend to extend this method to study the controllability of novel phenomenon like entanglement .",
