    "<S> coherent anti - stokes raman scattering ( cars ) processes are `` coherent , '' but the phase of the anti - stokes radiation is usually lost by most incoherent spectroscopic cars measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel raman microscopy imaging method called nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging , which measures raman spectra by obtaining the temporal anti - stokes signal through nonlinear interferometry . with a more complete knowledge of the anti - stokes signal , </S>",
    "<S> we show through simulations that a high - resolution raman spectrum can be obtained of a molecule in a single pulse using broadband radiation </S>",
    "<S> . this could be useful for identifying the three - dimensional spatial distribution of molecular species in tissue .    </S>",
    "<S> functional imaging techniques have been developed to provide insight into biological processes . </S>",
    "<S> optical functional imaging is frequently limited because dyes or markers must be introduced that alter or damage biological tissues . because it is preferable to use endogenous properties of tissues to identify molecular contents , methods such as infrared and raman spectroscopy are used . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , coherent anti - stokes raman scattering ( cars ) processes have been successfully integrated with confocal scanning microscopes  @xcite to achieve three - dimensional molecular images of vibrational resonances . </S>",
    "<S> however , existing instruments measure only the total power of the received anti - stokes radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel method , nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging ( nivi ) , which utilizes nonlinear interferometry to measure the amplitude and phase of the anti - stokes light . an experimental demonstration of the principle of this technique has been demonstrated .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this additional phase information facilitates the inference of the amplitude and phase of the nonlinear susceptibility of the molecule . by utilizing nivi with properly designed illuminating radiation , a large region of the amplitude and phase of the raman spectrum </S>",
    "<S> can be sampled in a single brief pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> coherent anti - stokes raman scattering processes have only recently been used to probe biological specimens . </S>",
    "<S> the appeal of cars is that it can probe the density of molecules with a particular raman resonance frequency while exposing the specimen to relatively low levels of illumination . </S>",
    "<S> a typical cars process illuminates the specimen with a pump pulse of frequency @xmath0 , and a stokes pulse of frequency @xmath1 , which are separated by the vibrational frequency of interest @xmath2 . if a molecule with a raman resonance at frequency @xmath3 is present , an anti - stokes pulse at frequency @xmath4 is produced . in cars </S>",
    "<S> microscopy , tightly focused pump and stokes beams are scanned through the specimen , and the anti - stokes photon count is measured at each point . </S>",
    "<S> this photon count is proportional to the square of the molecular bond density and the magnitude of the raman susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear interferometry has been used to characterize the magnitude of the stimulated raman scattering nonlinearity in liquids  @xcite , and also of two cars signals  @xcite in gases .    </S>",
    "<S> the model of cars with broadband pulses used here is similar to that described by  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not assume that the illuminating radiation is narrowband . </S>",
    "<S> however , we stipulate that the molecule does not resonantly interact directly with any of the frequencies inside the illumination bandwidth or the generated anti - stokes bandwidth of the optical signal . </S>",
    "<S> the cars process is composed of two stimulated raman scattering processes involving four photons that begins and ends with the molecule in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> to describe cars , we denote the electric field incident on the molecule as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the first process is modeled by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars1 ] , and excites the nonlinear dipole polarization of the resonant transition . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 each pair of frequencies that are separated by a resonance of the molecule at frequency @xmath3 produces a nonlinear polarization in the molecule . another way to look at eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars1 ] is that , in the time domain , the molecule has a nonlinear polarization that is driven not by the electric field but by the instantaneous intensity envelope of the signal . in this formulation </S>",
    "<S> , we are neglecting any changes in @xmath7 that are dependent on the `` carrier '' envelope frequency on which the beats are imposed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore any pulse train with intensity beats at the resonance frequency will stimulate the nonlinear polarization . </S>",
    "<S> examples of this are pulses that are modulated periodically in the spectral domain with period @xmath3  @xcite , and interfering two relatively delayed chirped pulses to achieve a beat frequency proprortional to time delay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second step creates anti - stokes radiation by mixing the incoming radiation field with the polarization in the time domain , and is modeled by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars2a ] . </S>",
    "<S> the eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars1 ] and  [ eq : cars2a ] allow one to calculate the emitted cars radiation @xmath8 for a given @xmath5 and @xmath9 . while these relations do not constitute a linear relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> there is a linear dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath11 given an input field @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that with knowledge of the complex @xmath8 , one can do linear estimation to find @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of nivi over incoherent detection is that nonlinear interferometry enables the recovery of the complex @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> with a properly designed input pulse @xmath5 , the nonlinear susceptibility can be found in a particular frequency range .    </S>",
    "<S> nivi takes advantage of the coherent nature of the cars process to allow the phase - sensitive measurement of the anti - stokes radiation . </S>",
    "<S> conventional linear interferometry involves splitting a source light beam into two parts , each of which scatters linearly in the field , and which are then recombined and detected . </S>",
    "<S> nivi differs in that a cars process occurs to one of the split beams .    </S>",
    "<S> nivi can be implemented with the setup detailed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a broadband , phase - locked source of light pulses , such as those from a mode - locked laser . </S>",
    "<S> sources that can produce such light are ultrabroadband mode - locked ti - sapphire oscillators  @xcite , and supercontinuum sources  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the source is phase - locked , there is a deterministic relationship between phases at various frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this deterministic relationship will be preserved by coherent processes such as cars . to utilize this determinacy , the source bandwidth is split into higher and lower frequency bands , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] with a dichroic beamsplitter . </S>",
    "<S> the higher frequency band will be a reference signal @xmath12 , and will correspond to the bandwidth of the anti - stokes frequencies produced by a sample . the lower frequency band is temporally shaped to stimulate cars in the sample , a signal we denote by the frequency spectrum @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> some of the illumination signal will be converted to anti - stokes radiation by the sample . </S>",
    "<S> because cars processes are usually rather weak , we will assume that any new anti - stokes radiation created in the same bandwidth as the illumination will be inseparable from the illumination . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we will discard all anti - stokes light inside the illumination bandwidth with a high - pass frequency filter . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining anti - stokes light that passes through the filter , which we denote by the spectrum @xmath13 , corresponds to frequencies in the reference signal . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the reference signal @xmath14 and the anti - stokes spectrum @xmath13 with a 50:50 beam splitter , and utilize balanced detection to measure the intereference component on two photodetectors . </S>",
    "<S> there is a delay of time @xmath15 placed in the reference path to facilitate measuring the temporal cross - correlation between the reference and anti - stokes signals . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the two intensities @xmath16 as a function of delay between the signal and reference will be : @xmath17 if we call @xmath18 the fourier transform of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath15 , we find that @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> . thus the measured data retains its linear relationship with respect to the anti - stokes spectrum @xmath20 and therefore the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath11 .    besides the ability to find the complex - valued @xmath11 , interferometry eliminates the need for photon - counting detectors . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage is that interference will only occur when the anti - stokes light and the reference light arrive at the beam splitter at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , temporal gating can be used to produce three - dimensional vibrational images in a manner analogous to optical coherence tomography  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coherent detection is also far less sensitive to stray light than photon counting . because of this </S>",
    "<S> , nivi may be more adaptable to various scanning configurations and environments outside the laboratory .    to show that nivi can measure intervals of the raman spectrum in a single pulse </S>",
    "<S> , a pulse must be designed that can stimulate molecules in a broad raman spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the approach we take creates beats that instead of being of a constant frequency  @xcite , will be themselves chirped . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by combining two chirped pulses with a relative delay , but with different chirp rates . </S>",
    "<S> if we have a transform - limited pulsed source of center frequency @xmath21 and bandwidth @xmath22 , and we wish to sweep the beat frequency from @xmath23 to @xmath24 in time @xmath25 , we can design a pulse @xmath10 such that :    @xmath26\\mbox { for } \\omega_0-\\frac{\\delta \\omega}{2}<\\omega<\\omega_0 + \\frac{\\delta \\omega}{2 } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\tilde{e_i}(\\omega ) = 0 \\mbox { otherwise } \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{where } \\alpha = \\frac{2 \\delta \\omega - \\omega_h - \\omega_l}{2 t } , \\beta = \\frac{\\omega_h - \\omega_l}{2 t } , \\mbox { and } \\tau = \\frac{t}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_h}{\\delta </S>",
    "<S> \\omega-\\omega_h}+\\frac{\\omega_l}{\\delta \\omega-\\omega_l}\\right ) \\end{array } \\label{eq : nivi2}\\ ] ]    the variable @xmath27 is the common chirp to both pulses , @xmath28 is the difference chirp , @xmath29 is the time delay between the two pulses , and @xmath30 is the difference in field magnitude between the two pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse bandwidth has been apodized with a cosine window because in practice it seems to help the stability of the inversion . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bandwidth of the source @xmath31 must exceed @xmath24 so that beats can be formed at all raman frequencies . when creating the pulse , the chirp time @xmath25 will control the resolution with which one will be able to resolve frequencies in the raman spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the largest practical @xmath25 is determined by the dephasing time of the resonances , which in most liquids is on the order of picoseconds .    </S>",
    "<S> to demonstrate the feasibility of nivi , we simulate the illumination of a target molecule with the broadband pulse of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : nivi2 ] and use the returned signal to estimate the complex susceptibility @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show two simulations : one that is able to probe a wide bandwidth of raman resonances in a single pulse , and the other which is able to distinguish between two nearby resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we take as our hypothetical laser source a mode - locked ti - sapphire laser that can produce a pulse with a uniform bandwidth from 7001000 nm , and the setup of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth from 8001000 nm will be reserved for stimulating cars , with the remainder used as the reference signal . </S>",
    "<S> for the first simulation , the cars excitation bandwidth will be shaped such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> to show that the system can reconstruct several simultaneous resonances over the entire bandwidth , we create a hypothetical @xmath9 with several lorentzian resonances centered at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies are in the raman `` fingerprint '' region and would be useful for practical molecular identification .    the simulation was implemented by sampling the spectra of @xmath9 , @xmath5 , and @xmath13 with 20,000 points spaced at equal intervals from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in @xmath41 steps </S>",
    "<S> . the cross - correlations of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars1 ] and  [ eq : cars2a ] were computed using the fast fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> these two equations form a `` forward '' cars linear operator computing @xmath11 from @xmath8 which we call @xmath42 . to find the inverse of this operator </S>",
    "<S> , we used the tikhonov - regularized least - squares inversion operator , which is formally denoted by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the tikhonov regularization was included to improve the stability of the inverse and to account for potential noise sources such as thermal and photon noise in a practical experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath44 is chosen to account for the magnitude of additive white gaussian noise in a realistic experiment . </S>",
    "<S> in practice , @xmath45 was computed using the preconditioned conjugate gradient  @xcite method to avoid the very computationally expensive direct matrix inversion . while we do not model a real noise source here </S>",
    "<S> , tikhonov regularization adjusts the inverse operator such that features of the estimated spectrum @xmath11 that would be unstable due to insufficient information for reconstruction would tend towards zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the left column of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the temporal and spectral shapes of the input pulse . </S>",
    "<S> part ( a ) shows two chirped pulses that partially overlap , producing a beat pattern that stimulates the resonance . part ( b ) shows the power spectrum of the input pulse . </S>",
    "<S> part ( c ) shows the anti - stokes radiation spectrum , that is calculated using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : cars1 ] and  [ eq : cars2a ] . because the excitation light is assumed to be much more powerful that the anti - stokes light , we filter out all of the excitation bandwidth and utilize only wavelengths shorter than 800 nm for the inverse . the right column of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the original and reconstructed @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> part ( d ) is the magnitude of the spectrum of the intensity of the original pulse , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the beat frequencies of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the possible measurable raman frequencies with this pulse . </S>",
    "<S> part ( e ) shows the original @xmath11 raman spectrum magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> finally , part ( f ) is the tihkonov- regularized least - squares reconstructed @xmath11 based on only the anti - stokes frequencies from 700800 nm . in simulation , </S>",
    "<S> all of the spectral lines can be recovered . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum discernible separation in raman frequencies tends to increase as the raman frequency decreases because the anti - stokes radiation created by lower frequency resonances tends to overlap the original spectrum more .    as a second demonstration with two closely spaced raman lines , </S>",
    "<S> we consider deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) , which would be contained in the nucleus of a cell , and ribonucleic acid ( rna ) located throughout the cell . </S>",
    "<S> both macromolecules have @xmath46 phosphodiester resonances , but the resonance occurs in dna at @xmath47 and in rna at @xmath48 . to show that a properly designed pulse can recover both resonances distinctly , we design a @xmath11 that has resonances both at @xmath49 and @xmath48 , that could be created by mixing dna and rna . to probe this mixture , we create a pulse using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : nivi2 ] with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this simulation are shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the beat frequency spectrum , and original and reconstructured @xmath9 raman spectra . while the reconstructed lines are broadened , they are still quite distinct and would be useful for discerning the two molecules .    </S>",
    "<S> nivi is a flexible tool utilizing ultrafast pulses that can measure small or large portions of a raman spectrum of a molecule in a single pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it does so by interferometrically measuring the anti - stokes radiation from a molecule , stimulated by beats in intensity of an excitation field . from this anti - stokes field , the complex raman susceptibility can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially suited to biological imaging because while the pulse energy can be large , the peak power can remain small by chirping the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> for these reasons , we believe that nivi can be a general tool for noninvasively probing the molecular content of biological tissues . </S>"
