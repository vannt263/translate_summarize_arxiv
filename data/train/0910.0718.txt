    "it is a grouplike element of @xmath10 , and is thought of to be a generating function for multiple zeta values @xmath15 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the drinfeld associator enjoys the duality relation , the hexagon relation and the pentagon relation .",
    "an associator is , by definition , a grouplike elements of @xmath10 satisfying these three relations .",
    "the grothendieck - teichmller group of associators is closely related to the absolute galois group @xmath16 @xcite,@xcite .    that the drinfeld associator @xmath14 satisfies the duality relation and the hexagon relation",
    "is shown by considering the connection problem for the formal kz equation of one variable @xcite , @xcite . furthermore , that the totality of multiple zeta values is closed under the shuffle product is equivalent to that @xmath14 is a grouplike element of @xmath10 .",
    "there is the second way to define the product of multiple zeta values ; it is the harmonic product or the series shuffle product .",
    "it is a generalization of the typical example @xmath17 ( as for the precise definition , see section 8.1 ) .    equating the harmonic product and the shuffle product of multiple zeta values , we obtain nontrivial @xmath18-linear relations for multiple zeta values known as the double shuffle relation @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that the ( regularized ) double shuffle relations contain all the @xmath18-linear relations for multiple zeta values .",
    "deligne - terasoma @xcite , besser - furusho @xcite and furusho @xcite derived the double shuffle relations from the pentagon relation for the associators by means of methods in arithmetic geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "that the drinfeld associator satisfies the pentagon relation is shown by considering the connection problem for the formal kz equation on @xmath19 ( the formal kz equation of two variables ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so one can expect that there is a direct way to obtain the harmonic product of multiple zeta values .    in this article",
    ", we will derive the harmonic product of multiple zeta values from the decomposition theorem of the normalized fundamental solution of the formal kz equation of two variables .",
    "the formal kz equation of two variables is an integrable pfaffian system on @xmath20 with logarithmic poles along the divisors @xmath21 .",
    "the fundamental solution normalized at the origin is a grouplike element of @xmath22 , a completion of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath11 , and can be viewed as a generating function of hyperlogarithms of type @xmath19 @xmath23 where @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the decomposition theorem ( section [ sec : solution_of_2kz : decomposition ] ) says that the normalized fundamental solution @xmath26 decomposes , in two ways , to product of the normalized fundamental solutions of the formal ( generalized ) kz equations of one variable : @xmath27 this theorem plays a basic role in the connection problem of the formal kz equation of two variables .",
    "furthermore , one can show that each decomposition comes from iterated integrals along specified integral contours @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( section [ sec : contour_decomposition : iterated_calc ] ) .",
    "hence the normalized fundamental solution has iterated integral expressions of two types . equating them ,",
    "one has the generalized harmonic product relations for hyperlogarithms of type @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore it is shown that they involve properly the harmonic product of multiple polylogarithms , and taking the limit of them , the harmonic product of multiple zeta values is obtained .    the connection problem and the transformation theory of the formal kz equation on @xmath1 for general",
    "@xmath2 will appear in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : fkz ] , we give an account for the formal kz equation on the moduli space @xmath1 in the simplicial coordinate system and in the cubic coordinate system .",
    "especially , the infinitesimal pure braid relations and the arnold relations for differential forms in each coordinate system are considered in details .",
    "the formal kz equation represented in the cubic coordinate system is referred to as the formal kz equation of @xmath30 variables . in section [ sec:1kz ] , we consider the formal kz equation of one variable ( the formal 1kz equation , for short ) . representing the normalized fundamental solution in terms of iterated integral",
    ", we see that it is viewed as a generating function of multiple polylogarithms of one variable .",
    "we also consider the formal generalized @xmath31kz equation , and show that the normalized fundamental solution is thought of to be a generating function of hyperlogarithms of general type . in section [ sec:2kz ] , the formal kz equation of two variables ( the formal 2kz equation , for short ) is introduced and the tensor product decomposition theorem for the universal enveloping algebra @xmath11 of the infinitesimal pure braid lie algebra @xmath4 ( proposition [ prop : decomposition_of_x ] ) is established .    to solve the formal @xmath32kz equation by means of iterated integrals , in section [ sec : bar_algebra ] we consider an algebra @xmath33 of differential forms which is called the reduced bar algebra .",
    "such an algebra of differential forms is a standard one in the theory of the loop space cohomology @xcite , @xcite , and the reduced bar algebra is nothing but the 0-th cohomology of the reduced bar construction of the orlik - solomon algebra associated with the hyperplanes arrangement of type @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "one can regard @xmath33 as a dual hopf algebra of @xmath11 ( proposition [ prop : ux_b_duality ] ) , and through this duality , we can prove the tensor product decomposition for @xmath33 ( lemma [ lem : decompositionb ] and proposition [ prop : iota_isomorphism ] ) . for an element of @xmath33",
    ", we define the iterated integral @xcite and the value of the integral depends on only the homotopy type of the integral contour .",
    "the tensor product decomposition theorem for @xmath33 says that , choosing two specific integral contours @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the iterated integral of two variables reduces to the product of iterated integrals of one variable in two ways .",
    "we also note that the iterated integral is injective by the results of @xcite",
    ". therefore relations of iterated integrals are equivalent to relations of elements in @xmath33 .    in section [ sec : solution_of_2kz ] , we first prove the existence and the uniqueness of a normalized fundamental solution ( proposition [ prop:2kz_integrablity ] ) , and next the decomposition theorem for the fundamental solution ( proposition [ prop : decomposition ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : contour_decomposition ] , we show that the decomposition in two ways comes from the iterated integral expression along @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as a result , the comparison of the iterated integrals appearing in the coefficients of the two decomposition of the fundamental solution leads to the generalized harmonic product relations for hyperlogarithms of type @xmath19 ( theorem [ thm : generalized_harmonicproduct ] ) .    in section [ sec : harmonicproduct ] , we show that the generalized harmonic product relations properly involve the harmonic product of multiple polylogarithms ( theorem [ thm : harmonicproduct_2mpl ] ) .",
