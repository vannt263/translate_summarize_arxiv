    "nevertheless , networks of oscillators may possibly offer a distorted interpretation of synchronized firing in the real nervous system unless interactions among neurons are sufficiently weak . to provide a real understanding of the information processing of spike timing",

    "this theoretical result implies the outstanding nature of the spike - timing - dependent synaptic plasticity for encoding multiple spatio - temporal patterns .    in our previous study ,",
    "however , we did not carry out a stability analysis for the retrieval state , and hence it remained unclear whether the derived retrieval state are stable or not .",
    "we investigate the same models of neural networks also in the present study , but we assume that the @xmath0-function of the direct interaction decays much faster than the previous one . then , we find the phase transition due to the loss of the stability of retrieval state . in order to evaluate the critical point of this phase transition",
    "we consider employing floquet thoery .",
    "neverthless , the degree of freedom of the present system is infinite , and the naive application of floquet theory yields the eigenvalue problem with the infinite size of matrix .",
    "furtheremore , @xmath0-function we assume here exhibits the infinite long - time influence , and its treatment may also require the infinite size of matrix@xcite . without calculating the explicit form of the matrix , bressloff et al .",

    "we employ two theoretical techniques to reduce the size of the matrix for floquet theory .",
    "we first take the limit of the infinite large number of neurons , which reduces the stability problem of @xmath1 neurons into the problem of @xmath2 sublattices .",
    "then , we define some additional variables for each sublattice and evalute the infinite long - time influence of @xmath0-function with the finite size of the matrix . the explicit value of the matrix is calculated from the numerical integration of the single - body dynamics .",

    "with the short @xmath244 , firing of the first sublattice , which is induced by @xmath34 , brings about firing of the second sublattice immediately since some accumulation of inhibitory synaptic electric currents  @xmath24 are necessary to control the next firing .",

    "it is well known that the hippocampus is the important tissue for short term memory . in ca3 region of hippocampus",

    "memory stored in hippocampus should be transfered into other regions such as neocortex so that it is stored as the long term memory .",
    "recently , some experimental results begin to suggest that this memory transfer process takes place when sharp waves ( spw ) appear in hippocampus@xcite . in spw , fast periodic firings of interneurons ( @xmath253200 [ hz ] ) bring about oscillatory inhibitory synaptic electric currents in pyramidal neurons , and these oscillatory electric currents regulate occasional firings of pyramidal neurons@xcite .",
    "ndasdy et al .",
    "have investigated these occasional firings of pyramidal neurons and revealed that repeating firing patterns of pyramidal neurons are present in spw@xcite .",
    "these results of experiments indicate that spike timing of pyramidal neurons of spw represent some kind of memory that should be transfered into neocortex .",
    "also in the gamma oscillation , we observe oscillatory inhibitory synaptic electric currents due to periodic firing of interneurons , although its frequency is somewhat low ( 20 - 80 [ hz ] ) .",
    "buzski et al . have hypothesized that the firing patterns of pyramidal neurons in the gamma oscillation are stored in the recurrent connections of the ca3 region of hippocampus , and then these stored firing patterns are replayed in the firing patterns in spw in the time compressed manner@xcite .",
