    "many - body systems have an intriguing property : under the right circumstances , local interactions can conspire to produce long - range or global effects .",
    "this behavior leads to phase transitions in statistical mechanics , and it also appears in combinatorial problems such as 3-sat . if we consider quantum systems , the situation is more complicated , due to non - commuting measurements and the possibility of entanglement .",
    "this leads to new kinds of quantum phase transitions @xcite , and new examples such as the local hamiltonian problem @xcite .",
    "a basic question in all of these examples is : if we know local information about various parts of a system , what can we say about the system as a whole ? this paper gives one answer to this question , for quantum systems .",
    "suppose we have an @xmath0-qubit system , and we are given a collection of local density matrices @xmath1 , where each @xmath2 describes a subset @xmath11 of the qubits .",
    "we say that @xmath1 are `` consistent '' if there exists a global state @xmath3 ( on all @xmath0 qubits ) whose reduced density matrices match @xmath1 ; in other words , for all @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    clearly , if @xmath1 are consistent , then whenever two density matrices @xmath2 and @xmath14 describe overlapping subsets of qubits ( @xmath15 ) , they must agree on the intersection @xmath16 ; that is , @xmath17 .",
    "this gives a necessary condition for consistency .",
    "however , the above condition is not sufficient to guarantee consistency . to see this , consider the following example : we have three qubits , and we are told that qubits 1 and 2 are in the bell state @xmath18 , and qubits 2 and 3 are also in the same state @xmath19 . more formally , let @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and let @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 both agree on qubit 2 , since @xmath26 .",
    "but there is no state @xmath3 on all three qubits such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; one way to see this is to apply the strong subadditivity inequality , @xmath29 .",
    "thus the consistency of @xmath1 would seem to be a more subtle question .",
    "we prove the following result :    [ consistent - rhos ] if @xmath1 are consistent with some state @xmath4 , then they are also consistent with a state @xmath5 of the form @xmath6 , where each @xmath7 is a hermitian matrix acting on the qubits in @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath4 means that @xmath3 is a positive definite matrix .",
    "the state @xmath5 is known as a gibbs state .",
    "essentially , this result says that a gibbs state @xmath5 can simulate an arbitrary state @xmath4 , with respect to an observer who can only access subsets @xmath32 of the qubits .",
    "for example , consider a physical system with local interactions , described by a hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that the ground state of @xmath33 can be approximated by @xmath34 , for @xmath35 large ; and since @xmath33 is a sum of local terms , @xmath36 is a gibbs state .",
    "our result extends this simple observation to a much more general setting .    actually , we prove the following more general result : consider a finite quantum system , and let @xmath10 be observables ( hermitian matrices ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that the collection of matrices @xmath37 is linearly independent ( over @xmath38 ) .",
    "we say that a state @xmath39 has expectation values @xmath40 if @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "[ consistent - ts ] if there exists some state @xmath43 which has expectation values @xmath40 , then there exists a state @xmath44 which has the same expectation values @xmath40 , and is of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "this statement holds even when the observables @xmath10 do not commute .",
    "this result was previously proved by jaynes , as part of the maximum entropy principle in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "jaynes showed that the gibbs state @xmath44 is the state which maximizes the entropy @xmath47 subject to the constraints @xmath48 ; implicitly , he also showed that the gibbs state @xmath44 is always feasible , in the sense that it can produce the same expectation values @xmath49 as an arbitrary state @xmath43 .",
    "however , jaynes motivation was somewhat different from ours .",
    "jaynes was interested in statistical mechanics , which deals with large systems with many degrees of freedom and only a few constraints .",
    "feasibility is not usually a concern in such cases , while the maximum - entropy property is crucial in making plausible inferences about the `` true '' state of the system .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on finite quantum systems , with many non - commuting constraints ; we are interested in the relationship between local constraints and the global state of the system . for us",
    ", feasibility of the gibbs state is important , since it is possible for the system to become overdetermined .",
    "statistical inference is less important , because the systems we study are small enough that their state can be completely determined ( at least in principle ) . rather than viewing this as an inference problem",
    ", we can speak directly about what states are allowed under a given set of constraints .",
    "finally , we prove our result using a technique which is different from jaynes .",
    "jaynes used the lagrange dual of the entropy - maximization problem , while we use some analytic properties of the partition function .",
    "our analysis bears some resemblance to classical results on exponential families in statistics @xcite  although the technical details are quite different .",
    "our proof also contains some geometric intuition which may be of interest .",
    "first , we will review some useful facts about the partition function for a gibbs state",
    ". then we will prove theorem [ consistent - ts ] , and obtain theorem [ consistent - rhos ] as a special case .",
    "recall the situation described in theorem [ consistent - ts ] : we have a finite quantum system , and observables @xmath10 , such that @xmath37 are linearly independent ( over @xmath38 ) .",
    "we are interested in states of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is called the partition function , and we also define the log partition function @xmath53 .    note that , in the above definition , we can translate each observable @xmath54 by a multiple of the identity , without changing the state @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , if we define new observables @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , we have that : @xmath58 using subscripts @xmath59 and @xmath60 to denote the two sets of observables , we arrive at the same state , @xmath61 , although the partition functions are different , @xmath62 .",
    "the log partition function @xmath63 has some nice analytic properties : it is convex , and its derivatives encode the expectation values of the observables @xmath54 .",
    "we briefly sketch these results , which can be found in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite , as well as quantum information geometry @xcite .",
    "proof sketch : this follows from some facts in matrix analysis @xcite .",
    "first , the golden - thompson inequality : if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are hermitian matrices , then @xmath67 next , a matrix version of hlder s inequality : for any matrix @xmath65 , define the frobenius or hilbert - schmidt norm to be @xmath68 .",
    "also , let @xmath69 denote the unique positive semidefinite square root of @xmath70 .",
    "then we have that , for all square matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74      proof sketch : use `` parameter differentiation '' @xcite : if @xmath33 is a hermitian matrix which depends on a parameter @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 exist and are continuous , then @xmath79 exists and is equal to @xmath80      proof : we are given expectation values @xmath40 , and we want to find a state @xmath81 that has these expectation values .",
    "( here , @xmath82 is the partition function , and @xmath83 is the log partition function . ) by translating the observables @xmath54 , we can assume that @xmath84 , for all @xmath42 .",
    "we can now restate the problem in terms of the log partition function : we are looking for some @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "we know there exists a state @xmath43 which has the desired expectation values @xmath40 .",
    "now choose some observables @xmath87 , such that the set @xmath88 is complete and linearly independent ( in other words , any @xmath89-dimensional hermitian matrix can be written uniquely as a real linear combination of the matrices in this set ) .",
    "let @xmath90 be the expectation values of @xmath39 for the observables @xmath87 ; that is , @xmath91 . by translating the @xmath92",
    ", we can assume that @xmath93 , for all @xmath94 .",
    "we will consider states of the form @xmath95 ( here , @xmath96 is the partition function , and @xmath97 is the log partition function . ) completeness of the @xmath54 and the @xmath92 implies that we can write @xmath39 in the form @xmath98 for some @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that @xmath100 for some @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , we claim that there is a unique point @xmath101 such that @xmath102 has the expectation values @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is because the expectation values @xmath103 and @xmath104 uniquely determine the state @xmath39 , and setting @xmath98 uniquely determines the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this in turn follows from the completeness and linear independence of the @xmath54 and the @xmath92 .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath100 at exactly one point @xmath101 .    to complete the proof , we will carry out the following plan : we will show that @xmath107 as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 denotes the norm of the vector @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that @xmath110 as @xmath111 ; and hence @xmath86 for some @xmath85 .",
