    "furthermore , in the following , we show in numerical simulations that morphological quenching can naturally occur in the cosmological context , and that gas disks with masses up to several @xmath33  m@xmath34 can be stabilized in etgs .",

    "to study galaxy evolution in the cosmological context , the standard technique consists in running full cosmological simulations with spatial and mass resolutions increased in a certain `` zoom - in '' area @xcite .",
    "a constraint is that all particles ending - up in the target galaxy should be low - mass , high - resolution ones .",

    "their evolution during the first 1.5  gyr is sensitive to the assumptions made on the star formation history of each galaxy before its entry into the virial radius ( see appendix  a ) , which can be seen as an initial scatter in figure  [ color ] . under most realistic assumptions ,",

    "this phase is quiescent in terms of merger events ; however , diffuse gas is continuously infalling at a steady rate ; the average gas accretion rate across the virial radius of the studied galaxy during this phase is 9  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 .",
    "the infalling gas adds to the gas mass left over after the initial mergers , so that the cold and dense ( @xmath60 m@xmath51pc@xmath52 ) gas mass in the studied galaxy varies from 5.1@xmath3810@xmath61  m@xmath34 at @xmath62  gyr to @xmath63  m@xmath34 at @xmath64  gyr ( the left panel of figure  [ mstar ] ) . during the quiescent phase ,",

    "this gas disk grows from the inside out : the density of the inner regions ( @xmath65  kpc ) does not evolve much during the quiescent phase while the accreting gas settles in the outskirts of the disk .",

    "( see also section 4.1 and table [ table_disks ] ) , star formation rates above 10  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 could have been expected : for instance the galaxy at the beginning of the mq phase has the same gas mass and gas surface density as the disk galaxy at @xmath67  gyr but the latter forms stars at a rate of 9  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 ( this will be discussed in more details in section 4.1 ) .",
    "the low sfr during the mq phase allows the formation a low - mass young stellar disk that never exceeds a few percent of the total stellar mass : on average 2% , and at most 6% at @xmath68=11  gyr which is the end of the quiescent phase .",
    "thus , most of the stars of this galaxy still belong to the spheroid formed by the series of minor mergers at @xmath69 .",
    "the galaxy therefore remains elliptical - like , with only a low - mass disk component , as in many real elliptical galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the integrated color is indeed dominated by the contribution of the relatively old stars formed before / during the series of mergers .",
    "because of the low star formation rate , young stars with bluer colors are not numerous enough to impact the integrated color , even though their contribution is maximized by neglecting dust extinction in our color estimates .    the same color evolution is also found in other color indices such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see appendix c ) .",

    "this simulation shows that the effect of morphological quenching can be strong enough to turn an etg red without requiring the removal of cold gas reservoirs and the termination of gas supply .",
    "we will show in section  4 how the low efficiency of star formation in this gas - rich red elliptical is connected to the presence of a stellar spheroid instead of a disk - dominated galaxy .",
    "we will also show that the gas disk is stable against star - forming instabilities , but unstable against non - axisymmetric modes which trigger the turbulence at the level required for @xmath76 stability .",
    "the studied galaxy finally undergoes a major merger between @xmath49 and @xmath41 , together with an increase of the diffuse gas accretion rate .",
    "the combination of the major merger and the increased gas content allows a large starburst to take place , with a peak sfr of up to 35  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 . as a consequence , the galaxy rapidly evolves toward blue colors .",
    "however , this blue color at @xmath41 is only a transient phase related to the merger - driven starburst .",
    "we have let this galaxy evolve after @xmath41 , and find that the star formation rate steadily decreases from 30  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 at @xmath41 to 10  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 after 2  gyr .",
    "the galaxy reddens again , reaching @xmath77 within 2  gyr ( figure  [ color ] ) .",
    "this red early - type galaxy still contains a significant fraction of cold gas ( 6% of the baryons ) , both because some gas is left over after the final merger , and some infalling gas that entered the virial radius at low redshift continues to feed the system ( even if we neglect gas accretion at the virial radius after @xmath41 ) .",
    "we thus find another etg turning red spontaneously , under the effect of the mq mechanism and without any mechanism removing its cold gas reservoir and/or stopping the infall of fresh gas .",
    "to better understand the relation between morphology and color evolution , we have performed the same simulation without the final @xmath78 major merger  earlier mergers and diffuse accretion remaining unchanged . while cosmologically realistic since directly motivated by a @xmath4-cdm simulation , the fiducial case may be less likely than this version without the final major merger , since the majority of massive galaxies do not undergo a major merger at @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we find that it is the accumulation of cold gas accretion more than the final major merger itself that causes the return to blue colors at @xmath78 ( figure  [ color ] ) . indeed , even without the final major merger , the galaxy undergoes a phase of intense star formation at low redshift , with a star formation rate reaching 25  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 at @xmath41 . the most important difference induced by removing the final merger lies in the morphology of the galaxy at @xmath41 ( figure  [ evol ] ) . with the final major merger ,",
    "the galaxy is elliptical , and we find that its blue color is only transient and rapidly turns red under a mq affect ( see above ) . without the final merger , the galaxy is more disk dominated , forming stars more durably ; it develops spiral arms that host efficient star formation and are visible in the @xmath41 stellar disk ( figure  [ evol ] , see also section  4 ) .",
    "hence , the gas disk that was stabilized against star formation during the quiescent red phase can become actively star - forming again if the accumulated gas mass increases too much .",
    "our main findings from the simulation so far can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , a spheroid - dominated galaxy naturally becomes red and dead despite the presence of a relatively massive gas disk .",
    "there is no need for an external mechanism that removes the present gas or terminates the supply of fresh gas .",
    "second , a red spheroidal galaxy can turn back into a blue system composed of a bulge and a disk . in our current simulation ,",
    "this happened as a result of a continuous growth of the disk over several gyr through smooth gas accretion .",
    "the rather smooth gas streaming into a galaxy could thus significantly affect the morphology and the color of a galaxy .",
    "this is in addition to the effects of mergers , which tend to build spheroids and thus quench instability and star formation in gas disks .",
    "we find in our simulations that a dense gas disk can be stable against star formation when it is embedded in an early - type galaxy instead of a stellar disk .",

    "if the velocity dispersion @xmath9 was reduced in early - type galaxies , their gas disks could be jeans - unstable ( low @xmath29 ) in spite of the absence of a massive stellar disk .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas disk particles in our simulation remains about similar between the star - forming and non - star forming phases , where it lies on average around 15  km  s@xmath46 ( table [ table_disks ] ) . for star - forming galaxies , tamburro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicate a characteristic hi linewidth value of 8 - 12  km  s@xmath46 in 11 spiral galaxies .",
    "this value includes turbulent velocity dispersion as well as thermal broadening , but turbulence is expected to dominate at least in the central ( star - forming ) regions of these galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersion of our sticky particle medium is slightly higher value is thus an upper limit , but careful tests have ensured that the actual dispersion is not lower than 10  km  s@xmath46 . ] but includes all gas phases , so is consistent with observations on the blue sequence .",
    "a more important wonder is the level of turbulence in early - type galaxies with low star formation efficiencies .",
    "the ism turbulence in star - forming spiral galaxies is mostly triggered by gravitational instabilities and star - formation feedback @xcite .",
    "an equally high level of turbulence in an inefficiently star - forming disk could then seem unexpected .",
    "several processes can nevertheless maintain the turbulence in the absence of star - forming instabilities : these could be ( i ) gravitational instabilities without star formation , ( ii ) rotational shear powering turbulence @xcite , ( iii ) interactions with small satellites , dark subhalos , or more generally clumpy infall @xcite , and ( iv ) the magnetorotational instability in magnetized disks @xcite . mechanism ( ii ) does not occur in our simulations since the critical reynolds number above which rotational shear instabilities might be able to grow is largely beyond reach @xcite .",
    "mechanism ( iv ) is not included in our models , and mechanism ( iii ) can not dominate as the mass infall on the studied red galaxy is quite smooth .",
    "mechanisms ( i ) should then be the main source of turbulence .",
    "gravity - driven turbulence does not necessarily require axisymmetric instabilities like dense clumps , and can actually be triggered with @xmath76 .",
    "a study of flocculent spirals by @xcite shows that turbulent motions are generated by non - axisymmetric instabilities ( spiral arms ) .",
    "this turbulence then acts at smaller scales where it form overdensities ( clouds ) , which in turn collapse if they exceed the critical density for @xmath7=1 . in this picture ,",
    "the turbulent energy is mostly pumped by large - scale , non axisymmetric instabilities like spiral arms .",
    "these structures can form with values of @xmath7 much higher than 1 and trigger the turbulence , without involving the collapse of gas clumps where stars would form efficiently .",
    "density maps of the non - star - forming gas disk at @xmath85  gyr support this picture ( figure  [ dmap ] ) : small spiral arms are ubiquitous .",
    "they have small pitch angle typical for low - mass disks in shearing potentials , but none are circular rings .",
    "they resemble the very winded , flocculent structures observed in real etgs , and could trigger turbulent motions just like in the star - forming spirals studied by @xcite . but the toomre parameter remains above 1 ( around 2 ) in these arms ( figure  [ qmap ] ) , and the disk density remains below the tidal density ( see below and figure  [ tmap ] ) .",
    "no dense clump can then collapse and the star formation efficiency remains low .",
    "this is confirmed by the densest regions in these arms being short - lived and not collapsing into bound clumps , as shown by the evolution of the gas density over a short period ( figure  [ dmap ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions of our modeled gas disk in a red etg are thus likely driven by one or several realistic processes including non - axisymmetric sheared instabilities , which does not seem to be a numerical artifact .",
    "the resulting turbulent pressure can provide the support against star - forming axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "observations of relatively high velocity dispersions in the non - star - forming outer hi disks of spiral galaxies @xcite , with level of velocity dispersions close to that of star - forming disks , suggest that some processes do drive the turbulence without triggering star formation , and could likely act in the internal regions of early - type galaxies to stabilize their gas disks in the morphological quenching mechanism .      in the red etg",
    ", the stability of the gas disk against axisymmetric perturbations prevents the formation of very dense gas clouds , for which high star formation efficiencies would result .",
    "we indeed assumed in our simulations that the star formation rate depends on the local gas density following a schmidt law , which is realistic for various triggering mechanisms ( pure gravitational instabilities , turbulent distribution of the density @xcite , cloud - cloud collisions @xcite ) , and we impose a gas density threshold for star formation at space densities of 0.03  m@xmath34pc@xmath52 , which is about one atom per cubic centimeter .",
    "this is a conservative assumption : for a gas disk of height 200  pc , it corresponds to a surface density of 6  m@xmath34pc@xmath75 : this is the minimal density for cool diffuse atomic clouds formation , which is only the first step towards star formation .",
    "the critical density threshold for star formation is generally above this minimal density ( see the review in @xcite and observations by @xcite ) .",
    "we have performed a test simulation with a star formation threshold set to 0.25  m@xmath34pc@xmath52 .",
    "the star formation history and color evolution are globally unchanged ( figure  [ color ] ) , and the colors are even slightly redder between 9  gyr and 11  gyr ( with a maximum @xmath86 at @xmath64  gyr ) . in the last part of the simulation , the galaxy experiences the same kind of bluing in both simulations .",
    "we also ran a simulation with no threshold for star formation , where the galaxy still becomes red during the quiescent phase ( see appendix a.4 for more details ) .",
    "that actively star - forming instabilities do not arise during the red early - type phase is likely a robust result , not only because @xmath76 , but also because the density of the gas disk remains below the limiting tidal density for the total galactic potential ( figure  [ tmap ] ) .",
    "this means that even the densest regions of the gas disk , in the spiral armlets , can not collapse because the tidal field exerted by the large - scale potential exceeds their internal gravity .",
    "the inefficient star - formation of the gas disk in the early - type galaxy is also consistent with this prescription , and the evolution of the gas density on short timescale ( figure  [ dmap ] ) shows that no bound clouds form even in the densest parts of the spiral armlets",
    ".    the @xmath87 pc scale - height of the stable gas disk in our simulation may be an artifact of the @xmath88 pc spatial resolution .",
    "had the disk been thinner , the gas would have been denser and less stable against star formation according to the tidal density criterion .",
    "however , such a very thin disk would require a much lower level of velocity dispersion , which would result only in small , low - mass star forming regions    more generally , the mass resolution of a few @xmath89 makes it impossible to resolve or rule out the formation of dense , star - forming gas clouds with sizes of a few tens of parsec and masses of a few @xmath90 .",
    "the formation of small clouds in stabilized gas disks needs to be investigated in detail using simulations with a pc - like resolution , which can not yet be achieved in cosmological zoom - in simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we can infer that any such star - forming instabilities would have been of small masses , sizes , turbulent speeds and star - formation rates compared to the classical star - forming regions of spiral galaxies .",
    "the mq mechanism unveiled in our simulations remained unnoticed in previous studies of galaxy formation .",
    "this led for instance @xcite to conclude that agn feedback was likely necessary to explain the reddening of etgs . according to the analysis above",
    ", an accurate description of the color evolution of galaxies with gas disks relies on resolving star - forming clumps , which implies that the spatial resolution should be much better than one kpc , and the mass resolution should be at least @xmath91 . the turbulent velocity dispersion that acts to stabilize the disks",
    "should also be correctly simulated , which implies that shear instabilities such as spiral arms must be resolved .",
    "this requires the presence of a cold gas phase below @xmath92k .",
    "while such a phase is naturally present in our sticky particle models ( see appendix b ) , it requires a spatial resolution better than 100 pc in hydrodynamical simulations . a low spatial or mass resolution or a high temperature floor in the ism modeling might prevent the formation of substructures and leave the gas disks smooth in all galaxies , making it impossible to resolve dense star - forming clouds .",
    "a fundamental difference between the mq mechanism and the classical quenching mechanisms like agn feedback and virial shocks is that red galaxies are not supposed to have their cold gas reservoirs removed or heated .",
    "a prediction if mq plays an important role is that red early - type galaxies could contain significant amounts of cold gas , up to several percent of their baryonic mass .",
    "these cold gas reservoirs could sometimes reach masses and densities that would lead to efficient star formation and blue colors in spiral galaxies but do not form stars ( or only inefficiently ) when they are embedded in an elliptical galaxy .    in the local volume ,",
    "the gas content of red etgs ( ellipticals and s0s ) is often less than 1% of the baryonic mass , if detected at all ( e.g. , @xcite for atomic gas , @xcite for molecular gas ) .",
    "however , a large fraction of local etgs are in the virgo cluster or in dense groups , so they should have lost their cold atomic and molecular gas via ram pressure stripping ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the effect of ram pressure on molecular clouds ) , harassment @xcite , strangulation @xcite , etc .. recent studies suggest that hi detections could actually be common among field etgs @xcite .",
    "the gas fractions remain generally low @xcite , and a significant fraction is often in low - density outer structures or debris from tidal tails rather than internal disks @xcite , but a variety of processes can be responsible for the low remaining gas masses ( gas exhaustion , ram pressure and tidal stripping , strangulation ) and the gas fraction could have been higher a few gyrs ago .",
    "nevertheless , dense gas is sometimes found in the internal regions of etgs , even in the form of molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "massive red etgs can contain large amounts of dense gas in spite of their red colors , and only low levels of star formation are observed in these cases .",
    "a noticeable example is the elliptical galaxy ngc  2320 @xcite .",
    "this very red object ( @xmath93  1 ) contains about @xmath94  m@xmath51 of molecular gas in a disk of a few kpc of radius , not counting any possible atomic gas component , but its star formation rate remains at undetected levels , while such a high mass of molecular gas would turn any spiral galaxy blue .",
    "eso  381 - 47 is another red etg that has an unusually low star formation efficiency in its gas disk , as reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that ngc  3414 and 4278 host large hi disks but only old stellar populations ( see also shapiro et al . in preparation ) .",
    "although they do not dominate in the local universe , these examples of early - type galaxies with massive cold gas disks but red integrated colors and low star formation activities are likely candidates for the mq mechanism .",
    "if the morphological quenching mechanism plays a statistically important role in forming the red sequence , a prediction is that red early - type galaxies would frequently host significant amounts of cold gas , of few percent of their baryonic mass .",
    "this would not necessarily be the case in the local universe where other environmental processes have exhausted the gas content .",
    "this could be more frequent at high ( @xmath95 ) or intermediate ( @xmath96 ) redshifts , when most etgs are not in virialized clusters and dense groups yet , and the cold gas infall rates are higher .",
    "recent stellar population studies of red galaxies at high - redshift @xcite indicate that their colors are consistent with some residual star - formation activity",
    ". this could be compatible with the presence of gas disks forming stars inefficiently in a mq mechanism , instead of complete removal of cold gas and termination of gas supply .",
    "@xcite have recently obtained a near - infrared spectrum of one of the red etg in their @xmath97  2 sample , which suggest a low but non - zero star formation rate .",
    "this could also be consistent with the presence of a morphologically - quenched gas disk .",
    "this red etg has a stellar mass of 2@xmath98  m@xmath34 and an estimated sfr of 13  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 , which compares favorably to the mq phase in our simulations , but at higher @xmath99 .      at the end of our simulation",
    ", we obtain a blue elliptical galaxy just after a major merger .",
    "this is also briefly the case at @xmath100 gyr .",
    "these are galaxies that have just been transformed into ellipticals by mergers and experienced a starburst at the same time .",
    "a galaxy that has undergone a starburst can indeed remain blue for one or two gyrs depending on the strength of the starburst and the photometric bands considered ( e.g. , larson et al . 1980 ) .",
    "such blue elliptical galaxies are rare in the local universe .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that 4% of etgs at @xmath101 have blue colors , and most of these blue etgs are low mass , dwarf ellipticals .",
    "there are nevertheless known cases of red etgs with little on - going star formation but that have undergone a starburst in the last billion year : these e+a galaxies are rare at @xmath41 , probably because galaxies that have undergone a starburst - triggering merger in the last couple of gyrs are rare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the blue elliptical at the end of our simulation results in fact from the combination of two different phenomena , a major merger at @xmath102 , and a high gas accretion rate between @xmath103 and @xmath41 so that the final merger involves a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "our simulation shows that this can happen in @xmath4-cdm cosmology , although the rapidly decreasing major merger rate and gas accretion rate at @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) should make such cases infrequent , in agreement with the low fraction of e+a galaxies at low redshift . at higher",
    "redshift , the higher merger rate could increase the fraction of blue ellipticals and e+a galaxies , resembling for instance the blue elliptical at @xmath54 following several minor mergers .",
    "the two blue etgs in our simulations are short - lived : their recently formed stellar spheroid is quenching their star forming activity , and they are due to become red ellipticals in about 1  gyr .",
    "when we continue the simulation after the @xmath41 instant , the final galaxy also turns back red .",
    "we found in our model a case of red spheroidal galaxy evolving into a blue galaxy with a massive disk . in the model without the final @xmath78 major merger , this results in a disk+bulge galaxy at @xmath41 with a grand - design spiral structure .",
    "however , our model does not support a `` spiral rebuilding scenario '' according to which the majority spiral disks would be re - built after major mergers from tidal material falling back and/or fresh infalling gas @xcite , because :    \\(1 ) the reformation of a star - forming disk requires a high gas infall rate ( @xmath104  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 ) during several gyr , without any significant mergers during this period .",
    "this is above the average accretion rate expected from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for a typical galaxy with the mass of the milky - way @xcite , and above the typical observed gas infall rates , too @xcite .",
    "most galaxies would then be expected to accrete lower amounts of gas : in this case , the mq mechanism remains active and the star formation is quenched , preventing the re - formation of a stellar disk and the return to blue colors .",
    "a `` spiral rebuilding '' mechanism below @xmath105 then requires high rates of diffuse gas infall that seem unlikely to take place in most galaxies ; the return of a red galaxy to blue colors is a possible mechanism but likely taking place only in a small fraction of galaxies .",
    "\\(2 ) the re - built disk galaxy keeps important signs of the high - redshift mergers , even in our model without the final major merger . a massive , red stellar halo , as large as @xmath120 kpc in radius , is present , amounting to about 25% of the stellar mass at @xmath41 .",
    "the kpc - sized bulge amounts to 35% of the stellar mass , only 40% of the stellar mass hence being in the rotating disk .",
    "this disk galaxy rebuilt after a series of mergers therefore differs from typical local spiral galaxies @xcite , that have a significantly lower mass fraction in the rotating disk component .    furthermore , the transient blue elliptical phases in our models , either at @xmath107 or @xmath108 , correspond to post - merger elliptical galaxies that are about to redden rapidly .",
    "hence , neither of the blue etgs found in our @xmath4cdm - based models have blue colors persisting more than 1  gyr .",
    "they are not signs of spiral galaxies being rebuilt after the mergers ( but see @xcite ) , and these blue elliptical phases , potentially e+a - like , result from the time needed for a stellar population to redden after the star formation is quenched .",
    "we proposed a straightforward mechanism for the quenching of star formation in galactic disks once they become dominated by a stellar spheroid , which stabilizes the disk against fragmentation into bound , star - forming clumps .",
    "we demonstrated the natural occurrence of such morphological quenching in a cosmological simulation .",
    "for the purpose of a numerical study , we used a new efficient technique for simulating the evolution of a galaxy in a cosmological context .",
    "the merger history and smooth accretion history are recorded for a given galaxy in a cosmological simulation , and the evolution of the target galaxy is re - simulated at high resolution from @xmath42 to @xmath41 , including gas dynamics and star formation .",
    "we have studied the morphological and photometric evolution of a field galaxy ending with a stellar mass of 2@xmath3810@xmath109  m@xmath51 at @xmath41 .",
    "this galaxy goes through three different phases of growth : ( a ) a blue phase from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , during which a stellar spheroid is built by a series of minor mergers , ( b ) a long red phase from @xmath55 to @xmath112 , with smooth gas accretion at a high rate @xmath104  m@xmath34  yr@xmath46 , and ( c ) a blue phase after @xmath48 , following a major merger . based on the analysis of the evolution of this galaxy , our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "once a galaxy acquires a spheroid - dominated morphology , by a major merger , minor mergers or disk instabilities , it can spontaneously turn red .",
    "this occurs without gas removal or suppression of gas supply by other quenching mechanisms such as agn feedback , virial shock heating , gravitational quenching or ram pressure stripping .",
    "this morphological quenching in early - type galaxies reflects the stabilization of the disk by the dominant presence of a pressure - supported stellar spheroid , replacing the stellar disk .",
    "the stabilization of the gas disk is a result of two effects : the steep potential well induced by the spheroid and the removal of the stellar disk component that used to enhance the self - gravity of perturbations in the disk .",
    "early - type galaxies can thus be red and dead even in the presence of a gas disk , either left over after mergers or accreted later from the cosmological reservoir .",
    "the mq mechanism should be equally efficient if massive stellar spheroids are formed by another process than mergers , for instance giant disk instabilities and clump coalescence at high redshift @xcite .    in the case of merging galaxies with a higher gas fraction than what we studied here ,",
    "the final disk to spheroid ratio of the remnant is increased @xcite , so that the effect of mq would be weaker . however , most of these remnants are bulge - dominated , so that we can still expect the bulge to have a stabilizing effect , unless the disk is particularly massive . generally speaking , we propose that a galaxy with most of its stars in bulge and/or a thick disk might experience some morphological quenching , which could not only apply to ellipticals but also to s0 galaxies .",
    "future simulations will probably allow us to study this in more details .",
    "we also find that a red - and - dead galaxy can turn back into a blue star - forming galaxy .",
    "the gas disk can fragment to clumps and form stars again if it becomes dense enough to overcome the stabilizing effect of the spheroid .",
    "this requires a long phase of smooth gas accretion at a high rate , which is possible even at @xmath113 but only for a small fraction of the galaxies .",
    "such a galaxy that turns blue again is expected to have a spheroid of mass comparable to the disk mass , so it is not a likely progenitor of milky way - like spirals .",
    "our models indicate that blue ellipticals and e+a galaxies are more likely to be recently formed spheroids that are about to turn red than red merger remnants that are about to re - create a massive blue disk .    the natural process of morphological quenching provides a simple explanation for the most distinct feature of the observed galaxy bimodality @xcite , namely the fact that the color evolution of a galaxy is tightly linked to its morphological evolution .",
    "the mq can help quenching the star formation in galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "it should be naturally working in concert with other quenching mechanisms , depending on the mass and environment of each galaxy .",
    "but a unique feature of mq is the fact that it can explain the presence of red - and - dead galaxies in halos below the critical mass for virial shock heating , @xmath114 , where the other quenching mechanisms fail .",
    "current observations of large atomic and molecular gas reservoirs in local early - type galaxies , with red colors and low star formation rates , suggest that the reddening of elliptical galaxies can not be solely a result of gas removal or suppression of gas supply .",
    "morphological quenching could thus contribute to the formation of the modern red sequence .",
    "the presence of quenched gas disks in red etgs may be more frequent at higher redshift , where gas fractions and gas accretion rates are typically higher .",

    "the minimal number of particles per halo is fixed to 10 ( which corresponds to a minimal halo mass of 6.9@xmath3810@xmath125  m@xmath34 ) .",
    "particles that do not belong to a gravitationally bound halo will also be taken into account ; we will refer to them as `` diffuse '' mass accretion when they are accreted by the studied halo .",
    "we call `` main halo '' the halo ( and galaxy ) which we want to study and re - simulate , chosen in the final @xmath99 = 0 snapshot .",
    "when the studied halo is located in a rather empty environment ( i.e. it does not belong to a cluster , and no more massive halo is found within 2  mpc at @xmath41 ) , we do not take into account the large - scale tidal field when we re - simulate the history of the halo .",
    "this is the case for the halo studied in the present paper ( see right panel of figure [ figcosmo ] ) .",
    "the method used to extract the merger and accretion histories consists in following the main halo ( more exactly the most massive progenitor of the final halo ) from @xmath126 to @xmath37 and recording all the halos  the _ merger history _  and diffuse particles  the _ accretion history _  crossing a fixed spherical boundary around it .",
    "this boundary is a sphere of radius equal to the final virial radius of the main halo at @xmath41 , which is defined as : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the mass of the main halo at @xmath41 .    at @xmath42 ,",
    "the radius of this sphere is larger than the initial main halo : it encloses not only this main halo but also some satellite halos and diffuse particles .",
    "the re - simulation will begin at @xmath42 with all the halos and diffuse particles initially enclosed in the boundary .",
    "to this aim , we record their mass , position , velocity , and spin for the satellites , all in the rest frame of the main halo .",
    "positions are expressed in physical units instead of comoving , but with velocities corrected for the hubble flow : a radial velocity @xmath129 ( where @xmath130 is the distance to the center of mass of the main halo ) is added to the velocity of diffuse particles and to the velocity of the center of mass of the halos .",
    "we then check each subsequent output of the cosmological simulation ( snapshots are 60 myr apart ) , and search for particles that are inside the boundary but have not been found there earlier - on : these are particles that have crossed the boundary since the last snapshot . after having undergone the same modifications as described previously ( i.e. coordinate transformation from comoving to physical and addition of the hubble flow ) ,",
    "their mass , position and velocity are written in a catalog ( together with the redshift of their entrance in the boundary ) .",
    "as far as halos are concerned , we record a halo if at least one particle belonging to it has crossed the boundary , and write in the catalog the position , velocity , mass and spin of this halo when its first particle(s ) have crossed the boundary .",
    "the center of mass of the halo is thus still outside the boundary , particularly in the case of a large halo , but this choice has the advantage of being straightforward and accurate . according to its orbital parameters , the halo then might not totally enter the boundary and merge with the main halo .",
    "this is not a problem for the re - simulation , where it will not merge with the main halo either and will simply make a fly - by .",
    "the last point is that we have to handle the case of particles that enter a companion halo while this one has already been written in the catalog ( i.e. the halo has grown since some of its particles have first crossed the boundary and this halo still has not merged with the main halo ) . in this case , the particles are handled as diffuse accretion .",
    "a halo can then be surrounded by a cloud of diffuse particles .",
    "this approximation concerns only the `` satellites of a satellite '' merging simultaneously , which concerns only a small fraction of the total infalling mass .    to summarize ,",
    "the final products of this analysis are the following :    * an initial conditions file : a list of all the halos and particles that are already inside the boundary ( the final virial radius ) at @xmath42 * a catalog : a list of all the particles that cross the boundary between @xmath42 and @xmath41 and of all the interacting companion halos .",

    "the catalog we have extracted from the cosmological simulation also takes into account diffuse accretion of dark matter particles onto the main halo . in the re - simulation , we replace each of these diffuse particles by a blob of gas particles ( 17% in mass ) and dark matter particles ( 83% in mass ) .",

    "the blobs introduced in the simulation before @xmath147 have a radius of 2.5  kpc , the blobs introduced between @xmath147 and @xmath148 have a radius of 3.3  kpc and the blobs introduced after @xmath148 have a radius of 5  kpc .    the particles belonging to the blob are given no velocity dispersion since we expect the blob to be disrupted by the tidal field of the main galaxy anyway .",
    "we start the simulation with the main galaxy ( galaxy g1 in table [ table_galax ] ) at @xmath42 and place around it the satellite galaxies and gas blobs as prescribed by the initial conditions file ( see figure [ initgas ] the result of this operation ) . to place a satellite galaxy , we choose among the model galaxies the closest in mass , and put it at the right location with the right velocity .",

    "then , we read the catalog line per line and add in the simulation the other galaxies and the other blobs at the exact moment when they appeared in the cosmological simulation , with the exact position , velocity and spin extracted from the cosmological simulation .        to study the evolution of the total mass of stars and gas in the main galaxy , we take into account all the particles located within a sphere of radius 25  kpc around the center of the galaxy .",
    "in the same way , to study the star formation rate of this galaxy , we only count stars that form within this sphere ( i.e. we do not take into account stars forming in approaching companions that have not merged with the main galaxy yet ) .",
    "our simulation contains two types of stellar particles : those that were formed during the simulation ( and for which determining an age is straightforward ) and those that were initially present in the model galaxies we introduced in the simulation .",
    "we need to give an age to these stars in order to be able to compute galaxy colors , and for that we have used and tested different assumptions .",
    "their common characteristic is that they assume that the first stars began to form 500  myr after the big bang ( that is around @xmath149 ) .",
    "the subsequent star formation histories have been tested ( they concern not only the main galaxy , but also the infalling satellites for which we call @xmath150 the moment when they are introduced in the simulation ) :    * an exponentially decreasing sfr with a timescale @xmath151 given by @xmath152  myr * an exponentially decreasing sfr with a timescale @xmath153  gyr * a constant sfr between 500  myr and @xmath150 * half of the stars formed at @xmath154  myr and the other half formed according to a constant sfr between 500  myr and @xmath150    knowing the age of a stellar particle , we use the spectral evolution model pegase.2 to compute stellar colors assuming a salpeter initial mass function @xcite from 0.1 to 120  m@xmath34 @xcite . each stellar particle is thus given a luminosity in b , v and k bands ( johnsson filters ) , all magnitudes being then computed in the vega magnitude system .",
    "we assume a uniform solar metallicity in all our computations .",

    "the integrated galaxy luminosity in various bands is then computed by summing up the stellar population spectra ( we then consider all stars included in a sphere of radius 25  kpc around the center of this galaxy ) .",
    "extinction is not taken into account , since the evolution of galaxies between the blue and red populations is known not to be caused by dust absorption effects ; only some specific cases have their integrated color significantly reddened by extinction @xcite . neglecting dust reddening is a conservative assumption regarding our main conclusion on the spontaneous reddening of elliptical galaxies .      in the fiducial simulation shown in this paper , star formation",
    "is modeled with a schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite above a threshold of 0.03  m@xmath34pc@xmath52 .",

    "most of the differences arise during the morphological quenching phase , where , when no threshold is used , the star formation rate is twice higher with respect to what was found for the fiducial simulation . similarly , setting a higher threshold reduces the star formation rate during this phase . as a consequence , the main galaxy experiences a reddening during the morphological quenching phase for the three different models , but this reddening is stronger for higher star formation thresholds ( see right panel of figure [ comp_threshold ] ) .",

    "<S> we point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption , removal or termination of gas supply . </S>",
    "<S> given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks , it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps . </S>",
    "<S> this can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid , for instance by mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we present the concept of morphological quenching ( mq ) using standard disk instability analysis , and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom - in technique . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk , quench star formation , and turn an early - type galaxy red and dead while gas accretion continues . </S>",
    "<S> the turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star - forming clumps . </S>",
    "<S> while other quenching mechanisms , such as gas stripping , agn feedback , virial shock heating , and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos , the mq can explain the appearance of red early - type galaxies also in halos less massive than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the dense gas disks observed in some of today s red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism , whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift . </S>"
