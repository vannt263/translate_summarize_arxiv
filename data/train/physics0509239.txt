    "vapor cells are often a very convenient source of atoms for various spectroscopic measurements .",
    "although they suffer from relatively large doppler shifts compared to laser - cooled or beam sources , they are typically very simple and inexpensive devices and can often produce much larger optical densities than other more complicated schemes .",
    "vapor cells are widely used , and have been for some time .",
    "most alkali - atom based laser cooling experiments utilize vapor cells to lock the cooling and probing lasers to the atomic transition .",
    "these vapor cells typically consist of a glass vessel containing a small amount of alkali metal which is heated with a low power heater or simply by contact with the room - temperature environment to produce an optically thick vapor .",
    "alkaline - earth spectroscopy has gained considerable interest in the past years , in part due to the use of the calcium @xmath1 @xmath2s@xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5p@xmath6 intercombination transition to realize optical frequency standards .",
    "as such there has been interest in creating simple sources of alkaline - earth vapors to use as references for these experiments . in our case",
    "we wanted to have a relatively simply calcium source for use in a laser lock for an excited state laser cooling scheme and in order to find the frequencies of the modes of a high - stability optical cavity relative to the calcium intercombination line .",
    "unfortunately the vapor pressures of the alkaline - earth elements are considerably lower than those of the alkali atoms .",
    "furthermore , the narrowness of the intercombination line compared to the doppler broadening of a near - room temperature vapor results in a very small effective absorption cross section , requiring high atomic densities in order to achieve appreciable absorption . as such , producing an optically dense vapor in a thermal cell requires vapors at temperatures which are incompatible with standard vacuum technology .",
    "there are many ways to achieve higher optical densities , such as the use of an electric discharge @xcite .",
    "but these schemes tend to be much more complicated than a simple vapor cell . even with these techniques",
    "it can still be difficult to produce the needed densities for spectroscopy on the intercombination line . before deciding to construct a high - temperature calcium vapor cell we tried to measure absorption on the intercombination line in a specially designed high - density discharge cell but did not detect any significant absorption . from measurements on the 423 nm resonance line we determined that this cell produced a ground state density of @xmath7 . in a single pass through the 10 cm discharge",
    "this should result in less than 1% absorption on the intercombination line .",
    "when designing a vapor cell there are several key factors to consider .",
    "the first is the length of the vapor cell",
    ". a longer cell will result in higher absorption at a given temperature .",
    "we decided that we wanted a relatively compact cell and decided to fix the length of the column of vapor to be about 10 cm .",
    "as discussed below , the total length of the vacuum chamber is a longer length of 51 cm to limit heat flow away from the vapor and to allow the ends of the chamber to be cool enough to mount to our optical table . to simplify the use of the cell we decided to design the cell to achieve our target of 50% absorption in a single pass through the cell , although the windows in the cell are large enough to accommodate multiple passes through the cell .",
    "given a cell length of @xmath810 cm and a target of 50% absorption we can calculate the required density of atoms in the cell using beer s law .",
    "beer s law states that the fraction of light transmitted through the cell when our laser is on resonance should be equal to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the density of atoms and @xmath11 is the length of the cell .",
    "the effective cross section , @xmath12 , is lower than the natural absorption cross section @xmath13 because , due to doppler broadening , only a small fraction of the atoms will be in resonance with the laser light at any given time .",
    "when the laser is on resonance , only those atoms which have a doppler shift less than about one natural line width will scatter significant amounts of light , and you would expect that the effective cross section should be lower than the natural cross section by a factor of the order of the ratio of the natural line width to the doppler broadened line width .    because the doppler broadening in our cell is much larger than both the natural line width @xmath14 and the laser line width , the effective on - resonance cross section @xmath12 is approximately equal to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the resonant wavelength of the transition , @xmath17 is the mass of an atom , @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath19 is the temperature of the vapor . in this limit @xmath12",
    "does not depend on the laser line width .",
    "although the effective cross section is temperature dependent , it is only mildly so  it varies by only 18% as the vapor goes from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . as such , to estimate the required temperature we can calculate the effective cross section at some reasonable temperature and then treat it as a constant . for a calcium vapor at @xmath22 , the effective on - resonance cross section for the intercombination line",
    "is @xmath23 . with this cross section , to get 10% absorption in a column of vapor 10 cm long requires a density of @xmath24 atoms per cubic cm .",
    "this is accomplished by a calcium vapor in equilibrium with solid calcium at @xmath25 . for 50% absorption ,",
    "a density of @xmath26 atoms per cubic cm is needed , requiring a temperature of @xmath27 .",
    "the construction of a vapor cell for spectroscopy on the calcium intercombination transition is non - trivial due to the relatively high temperature required and the scarcity of vacuum components which can operate at these temperatures . because the calcium will tend to accumulate at the coldest point in the cell , the coldest point",
    "will eventually determine the vapor pressure in the cell . in order to prevent fogging of the windows ,",
    "the cell s windows should be kept considerably hotter than the temperature of the vapor . as such",
    ", producing a @xmath27 vapor requires portions of the cell to be considerably hotter than @xmath27 .",
    "a blown glass cell would become soft and collapse at the required temperatures .",
    "the most commonly used metal to metal or glass to metal seals can only be baked up to about @xmath28 . the only inexpensive and highly reliable way to make metal to metal vacuum seals at these temperatures are to weld or braze components together . in order to evacuate the chamber ,",
    "a high temperature valve is also required .",
    "commercially available high - temperature valves are relatively expensive and typically can not be baked above @xmath28 .    to get around the expense and limitations of available high - temperature vacuum components , we decided to use a two - chamber design . in this design the hot calcium vapor",
    "is contained within an inner chamber which is surrounded by an outer chamber . because the vapor is contained in the inner chamber",
    ", the entire outer chamber does not have to be held at high temperatures .",
    "this allows simple commercially available seals and valves to be used on the outer chamber . and",
    "because the outer chamber is evacuated , the seals between the inner chamber and outer chamber do nt have to be vacuum tight in order to maintain vacuum in the inner chamber .",
    "the only requirement on the seals between the inner and outer chambers is that they leak calcium vapor at a sufficiently low rate to allow the cell to operate for a long time without maintenance .",
    "a scheme similar to our two - chamber design is discussed in @xcite . in this design",
    "there was no seal between the inner and outer chambers , but long narrow tubes are used to limit calcium diffusion out of the hot inner chamber . because the inner chamber is evacuated through these tubes no high temperature valve was required .",
    "optical access to the vapor was also done through these tubes , making window seals unnecessary .",
    "the large diffusion rate of calcium out of the inner chamber results in rapid fogging of the outer chamber windows .",
    "this was overcome in @xcite using mirrors inside the outer vacuum to deflect the light to windows which were away from the direct line - of - sight of the inner cell .",
    "these mirrors quickly coated with calcium , which reflected the light reasonably well .",
    "we chose not to implement this design for two reasons .",
    "first , we expect that calcium coated mirrors would have a tendency to oxidize when the chamber is vented to reload it with calcium .",
    "second , and more critical , the diffusion rate of calcium through these tubes is rather large  in the tests reported in @xcite the cell ran for only 3 days running at 460@xmath29c using an unspecified amount of calcium . to avoid the trouble of continually reloading the cell we designed a cell which uses windows to seal the calcium into the inner chamber .",
    "our goal for the cell was to maintain a vapor dense enough to achieve 10% absorption for over 1000 hours with an initial load of 5 grams of calcium .",
    "this implies a maximum allowable leak rate which is equivalent that of a hole with a cross section of about @xmath30 .",
    "while this is a very large hole by vacuum standards , it does require some care to be taken .",
    "for example , the two 20-mm diameter windows in our design have a combined circumference of 13 cm .",
    "if the average distance between the edge of the windows and the mating surface is greater than @xmath31 , the calcium leak rate will be too large .",
    "looser requirements could be achieved simply by loading the cell with more calcium . but",
    "this would increase the cost of operating the cell and increase the risk that over time enough of the calcium leaking out of the inner chamber would condense on the outer chamber windows to significantly reduce their transparency .",
    "our design is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : diagram ] . in this design",
    "the inner chamber is sandwiched between the two halves of the outer chamber .",
    "the inner chamber is 10 cm in length , and 5.1 cm in diameter .",
    "this diameter was chosen to accommodate the mounting of 20-mm diameter windows on the ends of the inner chamber .",
    "each half of the outer chamber is 20 cm long to allow the far ends of the cell to be relatively cool compared to the temperature of the inner chamber .",
    "the outer cell uses standard off - the - shelf metal - to - metal flanges with copper gaskets , and the windows on the outer cell are standard commercial vacuum windows .    to evacuate the cell ,",
    "one half of the outer chamber is connected to a vacuum pump through a valve .",
    "the two halves of the outer chamber are connected by a 5/16 inch steel tube , allowing them to both be evacuated at the same time .",
    "the inner chamber was connected to the outer chamber through a long flexible steel tube connected to a short piece of copper tubing which is brazed into a plate at the top of the inner chamber ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : diagram ] ) . after evacuating the inner cell through this copper tube ,",
    "we pinch the tube off using a pinch - off tool commonly used by plumbers to rapidly seal water leaks in copper tubing .",
    "we found that on a clean piece of copper this tool creates a vacuum - tight seal as long as the tool remains on the tube . to create a permanent seal , before removing the tool we cut the tube off just above the pinch and fill the stub with silver solder .",
    "the copper tube was made long enough to allow us to do the pinch - off procedure several times before we have to braze a new tube into the cell .",
    "two windows separate the inner chamber from the two halves of the outer chamber . to create a tight enough seal to contain the calcium vapor ,",
    "a copper gasket is placed between the windows and a flat steel mating surface .",
    "the window is then compressed by a metal ring held down with three bolts .",
    "the copper gaskets have beveled edges to create a knife - edge contact on each side of the gasket , similar to the gaskets used in the kasevich seal @xcite but with no attempt to obtain a vacuum - tight junction .",
    "sapphire windows were first used , but even when held at a temperature over 100@xmath29c hotter than the calcium vapor they quickly fogged over ( possibly due to a chemical reaction ) .",
    "we eventually switched to calcium fluoride windows , which have not shown any significant fogging and which have a thermal expansion coefficient which is a much better match to stainless steel and copper .",
    "the cell is heated by two band heaters at the location of the windows and by a high temperature heat tape wrapped around a cylindrical aluminum sleeve which is slid over the copper tube .",
    "the maximum temperatures that the cell can maintain are set by the maximum rated temperatures of the heaters .",
    "the band heaters can be heated as high as @xmath32 .",
    "the heat tape is rated to go up to @xmath33 , sufficient to produce atomic vapors with nearly 100% absorption .",
    "if not wrapped properly , however , heat tape can generate `` hot spots '' and fail .",
    "as such we ran the heat tape conservatively , well below the maximum rated temperature .    the inner chamber is wrapped in several layers of high - temperature fiberglass insulation and aluminum foil .",
    "the outer chamber is not insulated , resulting in large temperature gradients such that the far ends of the cell are at a temperature of less than @xmath34c during operation of the cell .",
    "this allows us to seal the ends of the cell with standard vacuum viewports and makes it possible to mount the cell to our optics table without generating a significant heat load .",
    "since standard vacuum seals are used , we were able to easily add a vacuum `` t '' to one side of the outer chamber in order to accommodate a vacuum gauge .",
    "after loading calcium into the cell the cell is first heated using just the two band heaters , ensuring that the windows are the hottest parts of the inner chamber and thus preventing calcium build - up on the windows .",
    "eventually the calcium migrates to the colder copper tube and the vapor density drops .",
    "after this migration occurs we typically operate the cell with the band heaters fixed at @xmath35c and use the heat tape to control the calcium vapor pressure .",
    "a typical absorption spectrum from our cell is shown in fig . [",
    "cap : dataandfit ] .",
    "all of our absorption data was taken using a grating stabilized diode laser of the design described in @xcite .",
    "a portion of the laser light was sent to a reference etalon to measure how far the laser was scanned when taking absorption spectra . to verify the calibration of the etalon s free - spectral range , we scanned the laser frequency over a large range such that we could compare the etalon to a commercial wavelength meter .",
    "this measurement agreed with the manufacturer s specified free - spectral range of 2 ghz to within 0.5% .",
    "a beam splitter positioned just before the light entered the cell directed a portion of the beam to a photo - diode so that we could record a laser intensity reference to normalize away changes in the laser intensity during the scan . upon exiting the cell the light passed through a pair of interference filters to block the blackbody radiation from the cell .",
    "the light level was then detected on a photo - diode . during each scan",
    "a digital oscilloscope recorded the light power before the cell , the light power after the cell , and the amount of light passing through the reference etalon . to remove stray - light background levels , a second set of traces",
    "were recorded with the light blocked near the laser .",
    "to process the data we first subtracted the background from the scans of the laser power before and after the cell .",
    "we then divided the absorption signal at each point in time by the intensity reference .",
    "next we calculated a parabolic fit to the location in time of each peak measured on the reference etalon and used this fit to convert the time axis for each of our scans into a calibrated frequency axis corrected for the nonlinear scan of the laser s frequency in time ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : dataandfit ] ) . finally , we corrected for etaloning effects due to the windows in the cell by fitting the very edges of the absorption signal , where essentially no absorption occurred , to a second order polynomial .",
    "we subtracted the polynomial from the absorption scan and then normalized the scan so that the leftmost edge was equal to 1 .    to test the longevity of the cell we loaded the cell with only 0.5 grams of calcium and ran the cell for over 60 hours at high enough temperatures to produce between 30 and 50 percent absorption . because the rate at which calcium leaks out of the inner cell is proportional to the density of the vapor",
    ", we can conclude that the amount of calcium which leaked out of the inner chamber while we ran the cell is equivalent to the leakage that would occur while operating the cell for over 200 hours at a lower temperature to produce 10% peak absorption , suggesting that we have surpassed our design goal of 1000 hours with 5 grams of calcium .    we have compared our absorption data to a model of the expected absorption profile .",
    "we first started with a model which had just one free parameter , the temperature of the vapor . assuming that the temperature of the solid calcium ( which acts as the source for the calcium vapor ) was similar to the temperature of the vapor",
    ", we expected that this one parameter would describe both the doppler width of the absorption curve as well as the density of the vapor ( which , along with the doppler width , determines the on - resonance absorption ) .",
    "although this simplest model produced reasonably good results on our earliest data , after running the cell for several hours the measured absorption curves became noticeably wider than the curves predicted by our model .",
    "the fact that our single - parameter model does not fit most of our data well is not surprising .",
    "one would expect that once all of the solid calcium had migrated into the copper tube , which is at a significantly lower temperature than the rest of the inner chamber , a somewhat more complicated two - parameter model would be needed . in this model",
    "the temperature of the solid calcium , which acts as the source of the vapor , and the effective temperature of the vapor were entered as separate free parameters .",
    "we also tried fitting our data to a voigt profile model which included a third free parameter to include possible effects of pressure broadening .",
    "our two - parameter model fits the data reasonably well when we assume that the temperature of the vapor is close to the temperature of the windows ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : dataandfit ] ) . although we do nt know the precise temperature at the location of the solid calcium , from measurements at the top and bottom of the copper tube we have a range of possible temperatures . from the curve fits to our data it is apparent that the density of the vapor is consistent with this range of temperatures .",
    "when we add pressure broadening to our model it was very obvious that the voigt profile did not have the same shape as the data unless the pressure broadening was assumed to be less than 100 mhz .",
    "this implies that most of the disagreement between our simple one - parameter model and the measured curves is due to the higher temperature of the vapor rather than pressure broadening .",
    "because 100 mhz is much smaller than the doppler width we can only ascertain an upper limit on pressure broadening through curve fitting .",
    "we have determined a lower limit on pressure broadening by observing an increase in the saturation intensity ; at the cell temperatures used to take the data in fig .",
    "[ cap : dataandfit ] we found that using all of the power from our laser we could increase the intensity of our light to over 10,000 times the saturation intensity for a collision - free gas without seeing any significant reduction in absorption , implying a lower limit on the pressure broadening of several mhz .",
    "because the pressure - broadened width is significantly smaller the doppler width , a simpler absorption model which does not include pressure broadening is still quite accurate .",
    "this makes data analysis much faster , avoiding repetitive calculations of the integral in the voigt profile to optimise a curve fit .",
    "the simple model works because the area under the absorption curve of a pressure broadened gas is independent of the amount of broadening .",
    "this can be shown without any knowledge of what the atoms are colliding with , what the collision frequency is , or even whether the line shape is lorentzian or if the impact approximation applies .",
    "we only need to assume that collisions only result in phase shifts with no direct excitation or de - excitation . from the atom s frame it is equivalent to think of the laser field s phase , rather than the atom s phase , as changing during the collision , resulting in a light field which is",
    "effectively frequency broadened .",
    "as such , pressure broadening can be thought of as the redistribution of optical power to different frequencies ( from the perspective of the atom ) with the total power in the light field remaining constant .",
    "pressure broadening in our cell is a disadvantage if precise location of the atomic transition frequency is required .",
    "but for our purpose of finding the frequencies of the modes of an ultra - stable high - finesse cavity relative to the absorption line we only needed to find the top of the absorption line to an accuracy of about 10 mhz . and because the saturation intensity of collisionless calcium vapor is just 0.2@xmath36w/@xmath37 , the increased saturation intensity due to collisions allows us to send much more light through the cell and make huge improvements in the signal - to - noise ratio . at these intensities",
    "our principle noise source was the digitization noise of the digital oscilloscope which we used to acquire data , and with little effort we acquired clean enough data to find the center of the doppler - broadened line within the required 10 mhz .",
    "with our high - stability optical cavity we determined that the center of the line did not shift measurably over the range of temperatures used in the cell .",
    "for us the only disadvantage of pressure broadening was the fact that we were unable to reach the increased saturation intensity with our ~1 mw laser beam and were therefore unable to perform saturated - absorption spectroscopy .",
    "we have demonstrated a high - temperature two - chambered vapor cell for absorption spectroscopy on the calcium @xmath1 @xmath2s@xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5p@xmath6 intercombination transition . we have achieved high absorption and a long lifetime using a fairly simple and very robust design , without needing to use expensive or complicated high temperature seals or valves .",
    "although the seals between the two chambers do not need to be vacuum tight , we have found that care must be taken in order to a keep the calcium loss rate reasonably small .",
    "significant pressure broadening in the cell has been used to our advantage , allowing higher light intensities to be used , thereby improving the quality of our data ."
