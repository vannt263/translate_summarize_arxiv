    "since many years , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been applied to a plethora of systems in physics such as atomic nuclei , atoms , and molecules  @xcite .",
    "the only assumption is that the underlying ray dynamics is chaotic .",
    "more recently it found application in other undulatory systems as mesoscopic transport , microwaves , sound and elastic waves , among others  @xcite .",
    "the way in which rmt applies in the different systems , changes from one application to another . to predict the experiment , particular characteristics of each system",
    "should be taken in to account as the presence or absence of symmetry , interactions , etc .",
    "rmt yields universal predictions for the fluctuations but these fluctuations appear over an average .",
    "the average should be then taken into account as a non - universal feature .    in the case of the energy levels",
    "the mean level density is non - universal and depends on each system while the fluctuations are described by the gaussian ensembles . in the case of scattering systems",
    "the average of the @xmath0-matrix is non - universal but the fluctuations are described by the circular ensembles  @xcite .",
    "these non - universal features should be taken into account to fit experiments .",
    "a non - vanishing average of the @xmath0-matrix yields information of prompt responses in the scattering that can come from an imperfect coupling between the scattering channels and the inner region  @xcite .    as shown in several recent experiments  @xcite in mesoscopic systems with classical waves ,",
    "apart from non - universal features , losses appear .",
    "they can be taken into account at least in two different ways .",
    "on the one hand , imaginary potentials to simulate absorption ( or amplification ) can be introduced . on the other hand",
    "fictitious ( non - measurable ) leads can be added to the system .",
    "both approaches are equivalent in certain limit .",
    "when only equilibrated responses are present , the scattering matrix @xmath1 is unitary , its average is zero and it is distributed uniformly ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the sub - index indicates the absences of direct processes coming from prompt responses . unfortunately this ideal case is not common in the experiment ; real systems present direct processes coming from prompt responses .",
    "also , in macroscopic systems , losses affect the experimental results . in the next section poisson s kernel",
    "will be revisited ; in sec .",
    "the results for systems with absorption will be given . in sec .",
    "we will give some results of systems in which both , losses and direct processes are present .",
    "an alternative route was done in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the direct processes were extracted from the experiments to fit the rmt predictions .",
    "the statistical distributions of the @xmath0-matrix with direct processes ( or with imperfect coupling ) is given by the poisson s kernel .",
    "in the one - channel , unitary case ( without absorption nor amplification ) the @xmath0-matrix is parametrized as @xmath3 , and the poisson s kernel reads @xmath4 where the brackets refer to ensemble average . a plot of this distribution is given in fig .",

    "the coupling between the antenna and the microwave cavity yields the direct processes ; since the flat microwave cavity has the shape of the stadium , the distribution of its scattering matrix is chaotic . ]",
    "the results presented above can be generalized for @xmath17 channels . a similar transformation to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq.transformation1ch ] ) is valid in the case of @xmath17 channels .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath18 scattering matrix with direct processes is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20^{(\\beta n+2-\\beta)/2 } } { |{\\rm det}(i_n - s\\left\\langle s\\right\\rangle ^{\\dag})|^{(\\beta n+2-\\beta)}},\\ ] ] is the poisson s kernel for @xmath17 channels and @xmath21 is the invariant measure of the circular ensembles  @xcite .",
    "when absorption is present the scattering matrix is non - unitary . in the one - channel case , @xmath22 , the scattering matrix can be parametrized as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reflection coefficient and @xmath25 is twice the phase shift .",

    "when the system is non - unitary and has direct processes the way to proceed is similar to that when the scattering matrix is unitary . a non - unitary matrix @xmath14 without direct processes",

    "( [ eq.transformation1ch ] ) is valid for non - unitary matrices but the inverse transformation @xmath46 is needed .",
    "the scattering matrix with both losses and direct processes can be parametrized as @xmath47 and its distribution is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 should be determined from eq .",

    "those results were obtained using the _ heidelberg approach _ with one open channel and several fictitious leads that simulate the losses  @xcite . as can be seen in this figure ,",
    "the distribution of the reflection coefficient is quite similar for both cases .",
    "since the direct processes appear in all transport systems ( classical or quantum ) , this case shows that it is absolutely necessary to know quantify the direct processes are in each experimental system since transport properties , like the conductance , can be interpreted erroneously when the direct processes are not taken into account .     and @xmath52 is given by the squares ; the triangles correspond to @xmath55 and @xmath54 . ]    in the one - channel case there are two points missing , one related to the evaluation of the parameter @xmath30 and another related to the regimes defined by ( a ) the losses and ( b ) the direct processes .",
    "the first question was addressed using two different approaches , one by adjusting the fidelity  @xcite and another using the average of the reflection coefficient  @xcite . what is needed to quantify",
    "the strength of the absorption is a measurable parameter with a correspondence one to one with @xmath30 .",
    "one possibility relies on the average of the reflection coefficient @xmath56 and another in the fidelity .",
    "the second question was addressed only in ref  @xcite ; the direct processes introduce in the game a new time scale and redefine the regimes of weak and strong absorption are defined as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .    in the case of @xmath17-channels",
    ", the poisson s kernel can be generalized in the same way for non - unitary matrices .",
    "the result was obtained as the jacobian of the transformation that connects a non - unitary scattering matrix without direct processes and a non - unitary matrix with direct processes that are connected by @xmath59 .",
