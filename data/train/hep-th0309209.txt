    "the unexpected reality of the spectra of a class of non - hermitian quantum mechanical systems has provoked a fair amount of work since the first example was noted by bessis and zinn - justin @xcite . generalising the result at @xmath1 , a numerical study of the schrdinger equations @xmath2 led bender and boettcher to conjecture that under suitable boundary conditions the spectrum of ( [ bbeq ] ) was entirely real and positive provided @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "bender and boettcher also noticed the relevance of @xmath0-symmetry @xcite to these problems . for all @xmath4 , the potentials @xmath5 are invariant under the combined action of parity and time reversal , and this implies the eigenvalues are either real or occur in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "if all energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of the @xmath0 operator , then the spectrum is guaranteed to be entirely real , but this is not true in general : the @xmath0-symmetry can be spontaneously broken , in which case the corresponding energies occur in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "in fact , a proof of the reality conjecture has only recently been obtained @xcite , via a correspondence between ordinary differential equations and integrable models ( the so - called ` ode / im correspondence ' @xcite ) . here",
    "we review the proof and touch on a few of the byproducts of the correspondence relevant to the ode community .    generalising the bessis ",
    "zinn - justin and bender  boettcher hamiltonians , we consider the class of @xmath0-symmetric problems @xmath6 \\psi(x ) = \\lambda \\psi(x ) \\quad,\\quad \\psi(x ) \\in",
    "l^2({{\\cal c}})~. \\label{ptg}\\ ] ] for @xmath7 , the contour @xmath8 may be taken to be the real axis with a small dip below the origin if @xmath9 . for larger @xmath4",
    ", the contour should be distorted into the complex plane to ensure the correct analytical continuation of the original problem , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the result of @xcite is that the spectrum of ( [ ptg ] ) is _ real _ for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and _ positive _ for @xmath10 and @xmath12  .",
    "referring to figure  [ regions ] , reality was proven for @xmath13 , and positivity for @xmath14 .",
    "rather than considering the @xmath0-symmetric problem ( [ ptg ] ) alone , we introduce a related problem obtained from ( [ ptg ] ) by sending @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 it will be convenient to treat positive and negative values of @xmath18 together .",
    "the boundary conditions for ( [ eqd ] ) are that @xmath19 should vanish as @xmath20 along the real axis , and behave as @xmath21 as @xmath22 . for @xmath23 real and larger than @xmath24 ,",
    "this problem is hermitian . in the language of ordinary differential equations in the complex domain",
    ", it is sometimes called a ` radial ' problem , while ( [ ptg ] ) is called a ` lateral ' problem .",
    "( note , the radial problem can also be considered for @xmath25 , but is best then defined by analytic continuation in @xmath23 . )    following the ideas particularly advocated by sibuya and voros in the context of ordinary differential equations @xcite , we approach the spectral problems by studying the behaviour of the associated spectral determinants . adopting the convention used in @xcite ,",
    "let @xmath26 be the set of eigenvalues of ( [ ptg ] ) with inhomogeneous term @xmath27 , and let @xmath28 be the eigenvalues of ( [ eqd ] ) with inhomogeneous term @xmath29 .",
    "then define two pairs of spectral determinants , as follows : @xmath30 and @xmath31 both products are convergent for @xmath32 , and define entire functions of @xmath33 , and their zeroes ( or , for @xmath34 , their negatives ) coincide with the eigenvalues of the corresponding spectral problem . for @xmath35 convergence factors must be added , and it is more efficient to define the spectral determinants indirectly , via certain special ` sibuya ' solutions to ( [ eqd ] ) , which are anyway needed to prove the key identity ( [ tqeqb ] ) below ; see @xcite for more details .    by considering the asymptotic behaviour of the sibuya solutions in the complex plane it is not hard , following the arguments given in @xcite , to establish a stokes relation , from which one can obtain the following functional equations @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "this shows that the spectral problems ( [ ptg ] ) and ( [ eqd ] ) are related by much more than a simple change of variables and boundary conditions , and also that the spectral problem at positive @xmath18 is necessarily tied up with the problem at negative @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , this functional relation taken at @xmath38 is well - known in the integrable model ( i m ) world , where it goes by the name of baxter s tq relation .",
    "this observation , initially developed in @xcite , has led to an exact mapping between ode quantities such as spectral determinants and functions constructed in the context of integrable models .",
    "it provides a powerful tool to analyse ode problems using i m techniques , and vice - versa .",
    "if we set @xmath39 in ( [ tqeqb ] ) we can use the entirety of @xmath40 and the product form for @xmath41 ( [ specdeta ] ) to obtain @xmath42 in i m language sets of coupled equations of this type are known as bethe ansatz equations .",
    "their solution allows @xmath41 to be reconstructed via ( [ specdeta ] ) and thus @xmath40 using the tq relation ( [ tqeqb ] ) .",
    "finally the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian are found by searching for the zeros of @xmath34 .",
    "alternatively , a technique developed in integrable models allows one to convert the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bae1 ] ) into a single nonlinear integral equation , from which one can easily numerically obtain both the zeros of @xmath43 and @xmath34 , as first emphasised in @xcite .",
    "returning to the reality proof , a second set of bethe ansatz like equations can be obtained from ( [ tqeqb ] ) if we instead set @xmath44 and invoke the entirety of @xmath45 . rearranging and using the product form ( [ specdeta ] ) leads to @xmath46 this equation couples the so - far mysterious eigenvalue @xmath47 of the @xmath0-symmetric problem ( [ ptg ] ) to the much better - controlled eigenvalues of the hermitian problem ( [ eqd ] ) .",
    "indeed , a langer transformation @xcite shows that the eigenvalues @xmath48 of the radial problem are also positive if @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "it is from this equation that we are able to prove the reality of the @xmath0-symmetric problem .",
    "the first step will be to set @xmath50 .",
    "now take the modulus@xmath51 of ( [ bae2 ] ) to obtain @xmath52 for @xmath53 all the @xmath54 are positive , and each single term in the product on the lhs of ( [ abs ] ) is either greater than , smaller than , or equal to one depending only on the relative values of the cosine terms in the numerator and denominator .",
    "these are independent of the index @xmath55 . therefore the only possibility to match",
    "the rhs is for each term in the product to be individually equal to one , which for @xmath56 requires @xmath57 since @xmath58 , this latter condition implies @xmath59 and this establishes the reality of the eigenvalues of ( [ ptg ] ) for @xmath32 and @xmath53 or , relaxing the condition on @xmath23 , @xmath60 .    at @xmath61 the simple form ( [ specdeta ] ) for @xmath62 acquires extra convergence factors , resulting in a break down of the proof , as expected given the numerical findings of @xcite .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite ; for a further generalisation of the method , see @xcite .    finally",
    ", we remark that while the above constraints on the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath23 are sufficient conditions they are not necessary , as demonstrated in figure  [ scan ] for the case @xmath64 .",
    "the full domain of unreality , obtained numerically in @xcite , is the interior of the curved line , a proper subset of @xmath65 which only touches its boundary at isolated points . in the small , approximately - triangular region",
    "inside @xmath65 but outside the curved line which abuts the crossing of the lines separating the regions @xmath66 , the spectrum is not only real but also entirely positive , despite the fact that it lies outside the domain @xmath67 .",
    "the separating lines themselves have further significance , in that at these points the model has a hidden supersymmetry , which plays a significant rle in the breakdown of reality @xcite .",
    "one further application of the ode / im correspondence was also found in @xcite , and concerns the lateral and radial problems at @xmath64 . as remarked in @xcite , it is convenient to reparametrise the angular - momentum term by setting @xmath68 , so that the equation becomes @xmath69 define @xmath70 and let @xmath71 denote the spectral determinant for this problem . via the bethe ansatz approach , it turns out that this problem has a relationship with a _",
    "third_-order ordinary differential equation : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 this third - order equation is associated with @xmath75 bethe ansatz equations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the third - order equation is symmetrical in @xmath76 , a feature which is completely hidden in the original second - order equation . by playing with this symmetry , one can establish some novel spectral equivalences between different ( second - order ) radial problems , and also between these and certain lateral problems .",
    "we add to the results discussed in @xcite the remark that , when expressed in terms of the parameters @xmath77 , the mappings turn out to act as certain @xmath78 matrices in the weyl group of @xmath75 .",
    "the matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 defined as @xmath81 generate the weyl group of @xmath75 , the matrix @xmath79 describing a rotation and @xmath80 a reflection . in @xcite",
    "we found a spectral equivalence between a pair of radial problems @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "an equivalence was also obtained at a particular set of points for which the radial problem @xmath71 has a quasi - exactly solvable sector @xcite . for positive integer @xmath84 and @xmath85 ,",
    "the first @xmath84 levels of @xmath86 can be computed exactly as the zeros of the bender - dunne polynomials @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the result is that modulo the qes levels , the problems @xmath88 and @xmath86 are isospectral .    a further spectral equivalence particularly relevant to the main theme of this paper occurs between a radial problem and the related lateral problem ( [ ptg ] ) taken at @xmath64 .",
    "the equivalence is @xmath89 if we denote @xmath90 then the problem on the rhs is hermitian for @xmath91 , and this relation provides a simple explanation for the reality of the spectrum of the @xmath0-symmetric problems in these particular cases . at the points",
    "@xmath92 we can combine the dualities to prove a simple result concerning the spectrum of @xmath93 , namely that the only energies to become complex as the parameters @xmath94 move into region @xmath65 through qes values lie in the solvable part of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "this adds to a similar , as yet unproven , conjecture concerning quartic qes potentials @xcite .",
    "more detailed reviews of the ode / im correspondence , with more extensive sets of references , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the original correspondence relates only the groundstate of a quantum field theory to an ode , but recently a set of differential equations has been found for the excited states of the field theory @xcite .",
    "further aspects of the correspondence are still being developed , and much remains to be understood .",
    "in particular , it would be valuable to have a more physical insight into why the relationship between integrable quantum field theories and ordinary differential equations should be so close .",
    "as more examples are uncovered , we can start to hope that progress on this so - far mysterious issue may not be too far away .",
