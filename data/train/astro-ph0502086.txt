    "in the merger remnant system ngc  7252 maraston et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found the most luminous star cluster known to date , w3 .",
    "they determined its mass via two independent ways .",
    "first they used the total luminosity of @xmath9 and a stellar @xmath10 derived from a single stellar population model to estimate its mass to be @xmath11  m@xmath3 . as an independent approach they calculated the dynamical mass by measuring the velocity dispersion , which turned out to be quite high , @xmath12  kms@xmath6 , and the effective radius of w3 @xmath13  pc .",
    "this translates to a mass of w3 of @xmath14  m@xmath3 assuming dynamical equilibrium of a spherical object with isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the age of this object is about @xmath15@xmath1  myr ( maraston et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) , which indicates that it probably formed during the merger event of the host system .",
    "the projected distance of w3 to the centre of ngc  7252 is about @xmath16  kpc and w3 appears to lie within the optical radius of the galaxy .",
    "the size and mass of this object leads to the suggestion that it may be one of the recently discovered ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucd ) found in the fornax cluster ( hilker et al .",
    "1999 ; phillipps et al .",
    "2000 ) , rather than an ordinary globular cluster .",
    "the ucd galaxies have been suggested to be the cores of stripped nucleated dwarf galaxies ( bekki et al .",
    "2003 , mieske et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we propose instead a formation scenario which is closely related to the massive star - bursts caused by the interaction of two gas - rich disc galaxies . in interacting systems like the antennae ( ngc  4038/39 ; whitmore et al .  1999 ,",
    "zhang & fall 1999 ) regions of very intense star - formation arise as a result of the tightly compressed interstellar media .",
    "dozens and up to hundreds of young massive star clusters are observed to form in star cluster complexes ( or _ super - clusters _ ) spanning up to a few hundred pc in diameter .",
    "kroupa ( 1998 ) argues that these super - clusters have to be bound objects because their age ( @xmath17  myr ) indicates that they should be already dispersed . simulating super - clusters , by means of stellar dynamical @xmath18-body simulations , fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the star clusters within these super - clusters merge on very short time - scales ( a few dozens to a few hundred myr ) , namely a few crossing - times of the super - cluster .",
    "the resulting merger - objects can be characterised by their large effective radii .",
    "they show similar properties like the ucds ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a ) or the faint fuzzy star clusters ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002b ) found in a survey of s0 galaxies ( larsen & brodie 2000 ) , that are understood to be morphological types resulting from the merger of at least two late - type galaxies .    to distinguish between the two formation scenarios for ucd galaxies one would need detailed information about the metallicities and ages of the stellar populations inside these objects .",
    "dwarf galaxies have a rather complex mixture of stellar populations , while star clusters form in a single mono - metallic starburst .",
    "unfortunately this information is not yet accessible for objects as distant as the ucds in fornax or w3 in ngc  7252 .",
    "however , as pointed out by kroupa ( 1998 ) , objects as massive as the super clusters firstly can retain stellar winds thereby progressively building up an interstellar medium from which new stars may later form , secondly can capture old field stars during their formation and thirdly accrete gas later - on leading to younger stellar generations",
    ". the stellar age and metalicity distribution may thus be very complex in evolved super - clusters .",
    "the age - estimate of w3 points to the possibility that it may have formed during the merger event of the host - galaxy ( i.e.  out of merging star clusters ) rather than it being the stripped core of a dwarf galaxy , which should be very old .",
    "another indication of the nature of this object would come from a detailed surface - brightness profile .",
    "young massive star clusters formed in the large magellanic cloud in strong star burst regions show ripples in their profiles ( schweizer 2004 ) .",
    "this also suggests a formation history through the merging of several objects .",
    "in this project we perform stellar dynamical n - body simulations to show that the merging of star clusters in dense star cluster complexes is able to form massive objects like w3 in ngc  7252 . in the next section",
    "we describe the setup of our models followed by the results of our investigation",
    ". finally we end with a discussion of our results .",
    "the simulations are carried out with the particle - mesh code superbox with high - resolution sub - grids which stay focussed on the simulated objects ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in our models the super - cluster",
    "is initially represented by a plummer sphere with a plummer radius of @xmath19  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath1  pc .",
    "the clusters inside this super - cluster have a total mass of @xmath20  m@xmath3 , which leads to a crossing time of the super - cluster of @xmath21  myr . inside the plummer sphere of the super - cluster ,",
    "the particles have positions and velocities according to the plummer distribution function .",
    "the particles themselves are plummer spheres representing the star clusters with , respectively , plummer radii of @xmath22 or @xmath16  pc , masses of @xmath23 and @xmath24  m@xmath3 and crossing times of @xmath25 and @xmath26  myr , being represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28  particles . altogether the super - cluster is filled with @xmath29 star clusters , from which @xmath30 are light ones and @xmath31 are of the heavy type to mimic a power law mass spectrum similar ( power law index @xmath32 ) to the one found in the young massive star clusters in the antennae ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .",
    "to model hundreds of lighter and maybe thousands of ultra - light star clusters is beyond the abilities of our code and so we placed more mass into massive clusters .",
    "our previous work showed that applying a mass spectrum to the clusters does not affect the results , because the first build up of a heavy merger object in the centre of the super - cluster happens on a time - scale much shorter than the time - scale of mass - segregation or relaxation ( i.e.  shorter than @xmath33 ) .",
    "the effective radius of the light clusters is chosen according to the mean effective radius of the star clusters in the antennae ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) while the effective radius of the heavy ones represents merger - objects of many light star clusters , so that the overall model is such that progressively more massive clusters are constructed hierarchically from star clusters ( i.e.  truly mono - metalicity and mono - age populations ) with a finite upper mass limit ( weidner & kroupa 2004 ) .",
    "such a hierarchical model imposes no physical limit on the mass of the composite systems , and in principle entire galaxies can be viewed as being such objects .",
    "this also means that our model does not start at @xmath34 of the formation but after a time @xmath35 when the super - cluster is already free of its residual gas , as seen in the knots of the antennae , which are surrounded by @xmath36 bubbles ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "initially the single star clusters and the whole star cluster complex are in virial equilibrium , being set - up from the plummer distribution function ( aarseth et al .",
    "this corresponds to a high star - formation efficiency for such starburst objects ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "this super - cluster is now placed into an analytical galactic potential consisting of a logarithmic potential for the underlying halo , a plummer - kuzmin disc and a hernquist bulge , which add up to an almost flat rotation curve of @xmath37  kms@xmath6 .",
    "the super - cluster is placed at a distance of @xmath38  kpc initially ( apogalacticon ) on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon of @xmath16  kpc .",
    "the grid - levels of superbox are chosen in a way that the innermost grids with the highest resolution cover the single star clusters resolving intra - cluster forces and the forces during the merging of two star clusters .",
    "the median resolution grid is chosen to cover the area of the whole super - cluster , resolving the forces between the clusters .",
    "finally the outermost , non - moving grid covers the orbit of the super - cluster around the host galaxy .",
    "a detailed listing of the grid - parameters can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab : grid ] .",
    ".grid sizes ( size ) and resolutions ( resol . ) of the different grid - levels of the objects in the superbox simulation .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "in contrast to our previous models ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002a , b ) where the merger objects were smaller and not that heavy , the merging process here takes more time .",
    "after the first clusters have merged and build up a massive and extended object with the remaining clusters within , it is not encounters between clusters and the merger object which govern the merging process ( the clusters are already within the object ) but dynamical friction acting on the remaining clusters . nevertheless a massive merger object is present from an early stage on .",
    "the top row of figure  [ fig : t300 ] shows the contour plot of the merger object ( left at @xmath39 and right at @xmath40  myr comprising the suggested age - range of w3 ) .",
    "the contours are spaced in magnitude intervals and masses are converted to luminosities taking a mass - to - light ratio of 0.15 . according to a single stellar population model run with starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) a stellar population of this age has a @xmath41@xmath42 . in our model",
    "these two time - slices mark the transition between the time , when still many star clusters are visible as separate entities and the time when most of the star clusters have already merged or are dissolved within the merger object .",
    "the unmerged star clusters also cause little wiggles in the surface density profile .",
    "unfortunately ngc  7252 and thus w3 are too far away to resolve the surface density profile in detail .",
    "wiggles like this are found in resolved young massive star clusters in the lmc ( schweizer 2004 ) .",
