    "the reaction mechanisms in @xmath0 collisions provide insights in @xmath11 collision at high energies .",
    "the importance of each reaction mechanism depends on the collision energy and the @xmath12 domain .",
    "the flux - tube fragmentation process @xcite is expected to dominate at low @xmath12 and low @xmath13 , whereas the hard - scattering process @xcite at high @xmath14 and high @xmath13 .",
    "the two mechanisms cross - over at a certain transverse momentum @xmath15 that is a function of the collision energy , @xmath13 .",
    "there are in addition other mechanisms such as the recombination of partons @xcite and the production of resonances .",
    "it is desirable to establish , even if approximately , the boundary function @xmath15 that separates the region of flux - tube fragmentation dominance from the region of hard - scattering dominance .",
    "we need signatures for these two mechanisms to facilitate such a separation .",
    "the signature for the hard scattering process is well known .",
    "it is given as a two - hadron @xmath16@xmath17 angular correlation which shows a peak at @xmath18@xmath90 and a ridge along @xmath17 at @xmath19 .",
    "the peak at @xmath20@xmath90 arises from the fragmentation of the jet associated with the trigger and the ridge at @xmath20@xmath9@xmath21 arises from the fragmentation of the other jet associated with colliding partons with unbalanced longitudinal momenta .",
    "however , the signature for flux tube fragmentation has not been well studied .",
    "we would like to present here two signatures for flux - tube fragmentation @xcite .",
    "in the semi - classical description of the flux - tube fragmentation process @xcite for hadron production , the production of quark - antiquark pairs along a color flux tube precedes the fragmentation of the tube .",
    "the production of these quark - antiquark pairs must however obey conservation laws at the local production points . as a consequence , the produced @xmath3-@xmath5 pairs will lead to correlations of adjacently produced hadrons , and the hadrons are ordered according to their rapidities along the tube . the rapidity - space - time",
    "ordering and the local conservation laws will yield a many - body correlation of the hadrons in charge , flavor , and momentum , which may provide vital information on space - time dynamics of quarks and hadrons in the flux - tube fragmentation process .    as an example",
    ", we examine the fragmentation of a flux tube with an invariant mass of 8.65 gev , corresponding to the average invariant mass of one of the two flux tubes in a @xmath0 collision at 17.3 gev , with the flux tube formed by a quark of one proton with the diquark of the other proton .",
    "we carry out a monte carlo generation of hadrons in flux - tube fragmentation using the pythia 6.4 program @xcite .",
    "an example of the produced hadrons involving the production of a pair of strange hadrons is shown in fig .",
    "1 , with the production of 5 hadrons listed in table i.    [ fig1 ]    .",
    "an example of primary hadrons @xmath22 , their rapidities @xmath23 , their azimuthal angles @xmath24 and their constituents @xmath25-@xmath26 produced in the fragmentation of the @xmath27-@xmath28 flux tube at an energy of @xmath29=8.65 gev obtained with pythia 6.4 @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table 1 , the row of @xmath25-@xmath26 shows that upon ordering the hadrons according to their repidities @xmath23 as in a chain , the flavors of the constituent antiquark @xmath26 and the flavors of the neighboring constituent quark @xmath30 are correlated along the chain , on an event - by event basis .",
    "the row of @xmath24-@xmath31 of neighboring hadrons in table i indicates that neighboring pairs of hadrons are azimuthally correlated , approximately in a back - to - back manner .",
    "the many - hadron signature requires the identification of all hadrons detected in the events . predicted signature of this kind is yet to be observed .",
    "another signature of the flux tube fragmentation utilizes the two - hadron angular correlations arising from the productions of @xmath3-@xmath5 pairs . because of local conservation laws",
    ", the production of @xmath3-@xmath5 pairs will lead to correlations of adjacently produced hadrons .",
    "adjacently produced hadrons however can be signaled by their rapidity difference @xmath32 falling within the window of @xmath33@xmath9@xmath34 , on account of the space - time - rapidity ordering of produced mesons in a flux - tube fragmentation . therefore , the local conservation laws of momentum , charge , and flavor will lead to a suppression of the angular correlation function @xmath35 for two hadrons with opposite charges or strangeness at @xmath36@xmath370 , but an enhanced correlation on the back - to - back , away side at @xmath38@xmath9@xmath39 , within the window of @xmath40@xmath9@xmath41 .",
    "when we approximate the rapidity @xmath42 as the pseudorapidity @xmath43 , the two - hadron angular correlations can be used as signatures for the fragmentation of a color flux tube as shown in fig 2 .",
    "comparison of theoretical angular correlations for two hadrons with unlike charges in fig .",
    "2(a ) @xcite with experimental data from the star collaboration in fig .",
    "2(b ) @xcite indicates that in high - energy @xmath0 collisions at @xmath44200 gev , the production of unlike - charge hadron pairs in the region of @xmath12@xmath450.5 gev / c are qualitatively consistent with the flux - tube fragmentation mechanism .",
    "however , the correlations for two hadrons with unlike - charges in the region with @xmath12@xmath460.5 gev / c exhibit a completely different pattern .",
    "namely , they shows a peak at @xmath47 0 , and a ridge along @xmath48 at @xmath49 , which is a signature of the hard scattering process @xcite .",
    "this indicates that for @xmath0 collisions energy at @xmath50 gev , the boundary between the flux - tube fragmentation process and the hard - scattering process is @xmath51 gev / c . at the lhc energy of @xmath525 tev , the minimum bias data for",
    "the correlation of two hadrons with @xmath12@xmath460.1 gev / c show a pattern that appears to be a linear combination of the patterns for flux tube fragmentation and hard scattering @xcite .",
    "results in fig .",
    "2 , together with the two hadron correlation data from lower energies @xcite and higher energies @xcite reveal that the @xmath53 boundary of separation moves to lower @xmath12 values as the collision energy increases .    similarly , because of local conservation of strangeness in @xmath54 production , adjacently produced hadrons with opposite strangeness are correlated back - to - back in azimuthal angles .",

    "3 , with a suppression at @xmath47 0 and an enhancement at @xmath38@xmath9@xmath39 , within the window of @xmath56 conclusions and discussions ---------------------------    in the fragmentation of a flux tube , the production of @xmath57 pairs obey local conservation laws and the hadrons follow space - time - rapidity ordering . as a consequence ,",
    "a signature of the flux tube fragmentation consists of a chain of produced hadrons , correlated in rapidities , charges , flavors , and azimuthal angles .",
    "the observation of the chain of hadrons requires the identification of the produced hadrons which may be possible if the fraction of unobserved hadrons is small .",
    "another signature uses two - hadron angular correlations with opposite charges or strangeness , which exhibits a suppression at @xmath58@xmath90 , but an enhancement at @xmath59@xmath9@xmath21 , with the window of @xmath40@xmath9@xmath34 .",
    "it should be kept in mind however that resonance production and resonance decay into hadrons will exhibit angular correlations similar to the pattern of the flux - tube fragmentation .",
    "the resonance fraction give rise to complications and the two - hadron signature will work well if the resonance fraction is not dominant .",
    "various estimates give the resonance fractions to be of order 10 to 30% for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath60 gev @xcite .    in flux - tube fragmentation , the production of two adjacent hadrons with like charges or the same strangeness is prohibited @xcite .",
    "experimentally , two - hadron angular correlation of like charges with @xmath17@xmath90 is not zero @xcite which indicates that there may be an additional mechanism for like charge production with @xmath61@xmath62 .",
