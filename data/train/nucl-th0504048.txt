    "a primary goal of nucleus - nucleus scattering has been to learn about nuclear structure .",
    "this has become even more critical in recent years , when many groups became very active in the investigation of the physics of nuclei far from the stability , mainly using nucleus - nucleus scattering processes at intermediate energies ( @xmath0 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "the theoretical complexity of such collisions has given rise to the use of a number of different approximations .",
    "the adequate theoretical tool for this purpose is glauber s multiple - scattering theory @xcite .",
    "it has long been known both for its simplicity and amazing predictive power .",
    "one can find copious examples in the literature where the glauber theory allows for a simple physical interpretation of experimental results as well as their quantitative analysis @xcite .",
    "in fact , fragmentation reactions of the type discussed here have already been successfully analyzed in the framework of glauber s theory : in one - nucleon - removal reactions , the momentum distribution of the outgoing fragment has been shown to reflect the momentum distribution of the nucleon which is removed from the surface of the projectile nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , because of complications involving multiple scattering processes in nucleus - nucleus collisions , a full glauber multiple scattering expansion is impracticable .",
    "the study of many direct nuclear processes , e.g. nucleon knockout , or stripping , elastic breakup ( diffraction dissociation ) , etc , are possible using the optical limit of the glauber theory , in which the nuclear ground - state densities and the nucleon - nucleon total cross sections are the main input .",
    "in fact , this method has become one of the main tools in the study of nuclei far from stability @xcite .",
    "when departures from the optical limit are observed , multiple  nucleon - nucleon collisions and in - medium effects of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and nucleon - nucleon correlations become relevant .    very peripheral collisions , with impact parameters just around the sum of the nuclear radii",
    "( grazing collisions ) , or larger , are well established tools for studying nuclear properties with intermediate energies and relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these collisions lead to excitation of giant resonances through both electromagnetic and strong interactions . at intermediate energy collisions ( @xmath0 mev / nucleon ) , or higher ,",
    "the collision  time is short and the action of the short - range nuclear interaction can excite the surface region of the colliding nuclei . this excitation can equilibrate forming a compound nucleus , and/or give rise to pre - equilibrium emission or other fast dissipation processes .",
    "an interesting reaction mechanism in high - energy peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions was suggested by feshbach and zabek @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been applied in refs .",
    "@xcite to the calculation of pion production in heavy ion collisions from subthreshold to relativistic energies .",
    "it is assumed that pions are produced in peripheral processes through the excitation of the projectiles to a @xmath1-isobar giant resonance .",
    "the results of these calculations were compared to inclusive pion production data for incident energies from 50 mev to 2 gev per nucleon . as emphasized by those authors ,",
    "this comparison is not very meaningful at high energy where peripheral processes are expected to contribute very little to the total pion production .",
    "however , at subthreshold energies , coherent pion production should dominate the cross section .",
    "this mechanism is known as the nuclear weizsaecker - williams method .",
    "it works as follows .",
    "the uncertainty relation associated to the variation of the time - dependent nuclear field on a scale @xmath2 leads a relation between the energy , @xmath3 , and momentum transfer , @xmath4:@xmath5 the last equation on the right is the dispersion relation of a phonon . for typical situations ,",
    "@xmath2 is a few fermis and the nuclear interaction pulse carries several hundred mev .",
    "this relation can also be directly obtained from the collision kinematics .",
    "let @xmath6 be the initial momentum of the projectile and @xmath7 the energy - momentum transfer in the reaction .",
    "one has@xmath8 from these relations one finds@xmath9 neglect the term on the right - hand side , one gets@xmath10 where @xmath11  is the momentum transfer along the longitudinal direction .",
    "the above relation can only be satisfied for nuclear excitations of very small momentum transfers , even for moderately large energy transfers .",
    "this is the case for the excitation of giant resonances .",
    "thus , the nuclear interaction in grazing nuclear collisions is an effective tool to probe giant resonances ( for a review see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for very large impact parameters ( larger than the sum of the nuclear density radii )",
    "only the electromagnetic interaction is present , and eq .",
    "[ phonon ] ( with @xmath12 ) is just the energy - momentum relation of a real photon .",
    "in fact , relativistic coulomb excitation is another useful tool for investigating giant resonances @xcite .    the phonon - like relation , eq .",
    "[ phonon ] , is also a tool for studying nucleon - nucleon short - range correlations . the energy in eq .",
    "[ phonon ] could hardly be absorbed by a single nucleon since it would carry the momentum @xmath13 , which is appreciably larger than that of eq .",
    "[ phonon ] .",
    "however , the phonon could be absorbed by a correlated nucleon - pair , which can have large kinetic energy and small total momentum , when the nucleons move in approximately opposite directions .",
    "this mechanism has been exploited by previous authors to study the emission of correlated pairs in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "remarkably , refs .",
    "@xcite do not treat properly the nuclear absorption at small impact parameters , leading to very large cross sections for the emission of correlated pairs in peripheral collisions .    in many - body physics",
    "the word correlation is used to indicate effects beyond mean - field theories . in nuclear physics",
    "one distinguishes between short- and long - range correlations .",
    "nuclear collective phenomena such as vibrations and rotations are known to be ruled by long - range correlations .",
    "these effects are relatively well known .",
    "short - range correlations is also a subject of intensive studies in nuclear physics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the sources of short - range correlations are the strong repulsive core of the microscopic nucleon - nucleon interaction at short internucleon distances .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction becomes strongly repulsive at short distances .",
    "the phase shifts for @xmath14s@xmath15 and @xmath16s@xmath17 are positive at low , and become negative at higher energies @xcite .",
    "this indicates a repulsive core at short distances and attraction at long distances . in the nuclear medium",
    "this repulsive interaction is strongly influenced by pauli blocking .",
    "the search for nuclear phenomena showing short - range correlations effects is one of the most discussed topics in the nuclear structure community .",
    "for the nuclear reaction community , the importance of pauli correlations in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions has prompted the consideration of effects of dynamical short - range correlations .",
    "when one treats nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energies with an optical phase shift function one can include both the center - of - mass correlations and two - body correlations in a straightforward manner to obtain a rapidly converging series for the physical observables .",
    "it would be proper at this time to look for fingerprints of short - range correlations in high - energy collisions involving rare nuclear isotopes .",
    "recent experiments on knockout reactions seem to indicate a quenching of the spectroscopic factor relative to shell - model predictions in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "this reduction is thought to be a consequence of short - range correlations which spread the single particle strength to states with higher energies .",
    "in fact , systematic studies with the @xmath18 reaction have provided ample evidence for this quenching phenomenon @xcite . in this context , two - proton knockout reactions with exotic nuclear beams seem to be a promising tool to investigate short - range correlations in neutron(proton)-rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "indeed , for decades two - proton knockout has been considered a valuable tool to study short - range correlations in proton - nucleus and electron - nucleus processes ( for recent work , see e.g. @xcite ) . in high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the phonon mechanism , proposed by feshbach and zabek , is a useful guide for the investigation of short - range correlations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in this work",
    "we treat the effects of short - range correlations on heavy - ion scattering at high energies . in sec .",
    "2 the glauber formalism for diffraction dissociation is reviewed . in section 3",
    "this formalism is shown to lead to the same result as the traditional dwba calculations under the proper conditions .",
    "this is an important point , as diffraction dissociation and dwba approaches are commonly referred to as distinct reaction mechanisms in the literature . in section 4",
    "the role of absorption and lorentz boosts is discussed . in section 5",
    "the formalism is applied to heavy - ion collisions in the presence of two - body correlations , showing the connection with the feshbach and zabek method .",
    "the significance of short - range correlations is further discussed . in sec .",
    "6 the formalism is applied to carbon - carbon and @xmath19 collisions . in sec .",
    "7 some concluding remarks are made .",
    "let us consider high energy scattering , so that the energy transfer in the collision , @xmath3 , is much smaller than the kinetic energy of the colliding nuclei , @xmath20 . in most cases ,",
    "one is also interested in processes for which the fragments fly in the forward direction , i.e. we will also assume that @xmath21 .",
