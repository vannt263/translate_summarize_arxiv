    "asymptotic giant branch stars ( hereafter agbs ) are exceptional laboratories to test the robustness of stellar models . during this evolutionary phase ,",
    "both light ( c , n , f , na ) and heavy elements can be produced .",
    "the latter are synthesized via the slow neutron capture process ( the s - process ) .",
    "a detail description of agbs evolution and nucleosynthesis can be found in [ 1 ] .",
    "+ the structure of an agb consists of a partially degenerate co core , surrounded by an he - shell and an h - shell separated by a thin layer ( he - intershell ) and by a cool and expanded convective envelope . the surface luminosity is mainly sustained by the h - burning shell , active for most of the time .",
    "this situation is recurrently interrupted by the growing up of thermonuclear runaways driven by violent ignitions of 3@xmath4 reactions at the base of the he - intershell ( thermal pulses , hereafter tps ) .",
    "the energy suddenly released by tps can not be transported outward radiatively and , thus , convective episodes develop .",
    "these convective shells efficiently mix the he - intershell , enriching this layer in carbon ( produced by 3@xmath4 reactions ) and in s - process elements . moreover , the energy boosted by the tp forces the overlying layers to expand , possibly switching off the h - shell .",
    "this allows the convective envelope to penetrate downward , carrying to the surface the isotopes freshly synthesized in the he - intershell .",
    "this phenomenon is called third dredge up ( hereafter tdu ) and it is know to work in agb stars since the early fifties [ 2 ] . + the major neutron source in agb stars is the @xmath5c(@xmath4,n)@xmath6o reaction .",
    "neutrons are released within the he - intershell during the interpulse phase ( thus in radiative conditions ) when t@xmath7 k [ 3 ] .",
    "actually , the amount of @xmath5c requested to fit observations is one of the major sources of uncertainty in agb models ( [ 4 ] ; see also section [ modelli ] ) .",
    "a marginal contribution comes from the @xmath8ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath9 mg reaction , which is activated at higher temperatures ( t@xmath10 k ) during tps .",
    "the great amount of available spectroscopic data such as the need of yields for chemical evolution models require the computation of a large number of detailed agb evolutionary models .",
    "we fit this request by making available our theoretical results on the on - line web pages of the fruity ( funs repository of updated isotopic tables & yields ) database , entirely dedicated to the nucleosynthesis in agb stars .    in section [ modelli ]",
    "we briefly present our evolutionary code ( funs ) , while in section [ database ] we describe the set of models currently available on fruity . in section [ rota ] we present a recently published set of rotating agb stars .",
    "finally , in section [ up ] we list our planned upgrades .",
    "the funs ( full network stellar ) evolutionary code is a one - dimension hydrostatic code ( see [ 1 ] and references therein )",
    ". the adopted mass - loss rate has been calibrated on the period - luminosity and period- mass loss relations observed in long period variable stars [ 1 ] . in the envelope ,",
    "atomic and molecular opacities are calculated according to the changes in the chemical composition due to the occurrence of tdu episodes [ 4 ] .",
    "the radiation / convection interface at the inner border of the convective envelope is treated by applying an exponential decay of the convective velocities . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain the self - consistent formation of the @xmath5c pocket after each tp followed by tdu .",
    "the extension of the that pocket varies from tp to tp following the shrinking of the he - intershell [ 5 ] . in order to avoid the possible loss of accuracy inherent to post - process techniques",
    ", we directly coupled our models to a full nuclear network , which includes all isotopes from hydrogen to bismuth ( at the ending - point of the s - process path ) .",
    "the original set of fruity has been presented in [ 6 ] .",
    "it consists of 28 evolutionary models , with different combinations of masses ( 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 m@xmath11 ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h]= -1.15 , -0.67 , -0.37 , -0.24 , -0.15 , 0.00 , + 0.15 ) .",
    "different he contents and scaled solar compositions [ 7 ] are used ( see [ 6 ] for details ) .",
    "+ recently , new models have been uploaded . in particular ,",
    "the mass range has been expanded down to 1.3 m@xmath11 models .",
    "note that , at large metallicities , these masses do not experience tdu episodes . + in order to cover the metallicity range of galactic globular clusters , we compute two additional metallicities : [ fe / h]=-2.15 and [ fe / h]=-1.67 , both of them with @xmath4-enhanced elements ( [ @xmath4/fe]=0.5 ) .",
    "+ for each model , users can freely download pulse by pulse surface isotopic compositions and elemental overabundances = @xmath12(n(el)/n(fe))@xmath13 - @xmath12(n(el)/n(fe))@xmath11 ] .",
    "tables are available in two different formats ( see figure [ fig0 ] ) . in the multiple table format ,",
    "the query returns multiple table , depending on the number of selected models . in the single table format ,",
    "the query returns a single table containing all the selected models ; in this case , only single elements ( or isotopes ) can be visualized . among other quantities available on fruity",
    "there are the [ ls / fe ] = ( [ sr / fe]+[y / fe]+[zr / fe])/3 ] , the [ hs / fe ] = ( [ ba / fe]+[la / fe]+[nd / fe]+[sm / fe])/4 ] and the s - process indexes [ hs / ls ] , [ pb / hs ] and [ pb / ls ] . finally , stellar yields can be selected . with respect to the original version of the fruity database , beside net yields we also made available total stellar yields .",
    "+ users interested in upgrades of the fruity database can register to the dedicated mailing list .",
    "in order to verify the robustness of our models , we compare them to their observational counterparts . in particular , we concentrate on the luminosity function of carbon stars ( hereafter lfcs ) and on _ s_-process spectroscopic indexes at different metallicities",
    ".    the lfcs links the luminosity of these objects ( and thus the core mass ; see [ 8 ] ) with their carbon surface abundance .",
    "thus , by studying this quantity , we can test our prescriptions on convection and mass - loss law . in 2006 ,",
    "[ 9 ] analyzed a sample of galactic carbon stars and show how the radiation emitted by these objects at infrared wavelengths strongly weights the lfcs toward large lambdas .",
    "recently , [ 10 ] proposed a re - analysis of the same sample and found that the high luminosity tail of the lfcs described by [ 9 ] disappears , in good agreement with theoretical expectations [ 6 ] .",

    "see text for details . ]",
    "another useful litmus test for theoretical models is the study of s - process spectroscopic indexes , in particular the [ hs / ls ] and the [ pb / hs ] . before introducing them",
    ", a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic s - process rich stars has to be done .",
    "+ tp - agb stars are intrinsic s - rich stars , since they are presently undergoing thermal pulses and tdu episodes .",
    "post - agb stars belong to the same class . + extrinsic s - rich stars are less - evolved stars ( dwarfs or giants ) belonging to binary systems , whose s - enhancement is likely due to the pollution caused by the intense wind of an agb companion .",
    "ba - stars and , at lower metallicities , ch stars and carbon enhanced metal poor s - process rich stars ( hereafter cemp - s stars ) belong to this class of objects .",
    "+ the only possibility to group together all s - rich stars is to study relative surface abundances .",
    "in such a way , any problem correlated to possible further dilution process or to their evolutionary status is avoided .",
    "+ we have already shown that our theoretical models match observations , even if they are not able to explain the observed spread for a fixed metallicity ( see fig .",
    "12 and 13 of [ 6 ] ) .",
    "although it is possible that ( at least part of ) the observed spread can be ascribed to the large observational uncertainties , theoretical scenarios able to explain such a spread has to be explored . among them , we verified is the mixing induces by rotation can lead to a certain spread of the spectroscopic indexes .",
    "s - process index as a function of metallicity for models with and without rotation .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "even if low mass stars are generally slow rotators , the lifting due to the centrifugal force and the mixing induced by dynamical and secular instabilities can modify their physical structure and chemical composition . in order to verify the effect that rotation can have on the nucleosynthesis during the agb phase , we implement our models with rotation .",
    "in particular , we add rotation - induced mixing to the other mixing already considered in our previous works , those due to convection in particular .",
    "we found that a variation in the initial velocity can lead to a consistent spread in the final surface s - process enhancements and spectroscopic indexes for stars with the same initial mass and metallicity [ 11 ] . + rotation does not determine the formation of the @xmath5c pocket .",
    "notwithstanding , rotation - induced mixing modify the mass extension of both the @xmath5c and the @xmath16n pockets and their overlap , thus reducing the average neutrons - to - seeds ratio . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we report the @xmath5c and the @xmath16n abundances in the region where the @xmath17 @xmath5c pocket of a 2 m@xmath11 star with z=@xmath15 forms .",
    "left panels refer to a non - rotating model , while right panels to a model with initial rotation velocity @xmath18=30 km / s  . in the same plot",
    "we also report the local abundances of @xmath19y , @xmath20la and @xmath21pb , assumed as representative of the three s - process peaks .",
    "we find that the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability , active at the interface between the convective envelope and the rapid rotating core , contaminates the @xmath5c - pocket with @xmath16n .",
    "thus , the mixing induced by rotation locally decreases the neutron - to - seed ratio , leading to a reduction of the total amount of heavy elements produced by the s process and favoring the light - s elements with respect to the heavier ones . as a matter of fact , both the [ hs / ls ] and",
    "the [ pb / hs ] spectroscopic indexes decrease as the initial rotation velocity increases ( see figures 6 and 9 of [ 11 ] ) . at low metallicity ,",
    "the combined effect of goldreich - schubert - fricke instability and meridional circulations determines an increase of light - s and , to a less extent , heavy - s elements , while lead is strongly reduced .",
    "+ in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we report , as a function of the metallicity , the [ hs / ls ] and [ pb / hs ] s - process indexes for models with and without rotation .",
    "two values of initial rotation velocities ( @xmath18=60 km / s and @xmath18=120 km / s ) have been considered . with respect to the observational data reported in [ 6 ] , we add recent measurements of post - agb stars [ 12,13,14,15 ] , ba - stars [ 16,17 ] , ch stars [ 18,19,20 ] and a selection of well measured cemp - s stars ( see [ 21 ] and references therein ) .    , but for the [ pb / hs ] s - process index . ]",
    "our results suggest that rotation can be regarded as a possible physical mechanism responsible for the observed spread of s - process spectroscopic indexes .",
    "in particular , the large spread in the [ hs / ls ] at intermediate metallicities ( -1.0@xmath22[fe / h]@xmath23 - 0.6 ) can be reproduced by hypothesizing different initial rotation velocities .",
    "notwithstanding , our models can not match the large [ hs / ls ] ( up to 1 ) measured at low metallicities .",
    "interestingly , the lower [ pb / hs ] values characterizing rotating models are in agreement with observations .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , models with @xmath18=60 km / s better reproduce the sequence , starting from high z , of ba - stars ( full dots ) , ch stars ( open dots ) and cemp - s stars ( full triangles ) .",
    "unfortunately , firm conclusions can not be drawn due to the paucity of lead measurements and to the large errors affecting observations .",
    "the current version of fruity spans on a reasonable range of metallicities and well covers the low mass range . intermediate mass agb stars ( 4@xmath22 m / m@xmath24 7 ; hereafter im - agbs ) are currently missing .",
    "these stars are particulary important for the chemical evolution of globular clusters ( see e.g. [ 22 ] and references therein ) .",
    "we already conducted an explorative study of im - agbs [ 23 ] , but without publishing detailed nucleosynthetic predictions . therefore , we intend to explore the evolution and nucleosynthesis of im - agbs , starting from the metallicities of interest for the study of galactic globular clusters [ 24 ] .",
    "later , we aim to extend these calculations to all the metallicities considered in fruity . + finally , as a long - term project",
    ", we are planning to extend the mass range of fruity to massive stars , in order to study the weak component of the s - process , at work during the core - he burning and the c - burning shell phases particularly efficient when rotation is explicitly taken into account .",
