    "colloidal suspensions are solutions of solid ( or liquid ) mesoscopic particles immersed into another substance  @xcite",
    ". these systems , like blood , proteins in water , milk , inks , or paints , are ubiquitous in our everyday life and are extremely important in biology and industry . due to their potential applications for designing new materials with a wide range of viscoelastic properties , in the last few years",
    "there has been much interest in the role of the inter - particle potential on controlling the structural and dynamical properties of colloidal systems . by appropriately varying some control parameters ( such as the composition of the solvent , the coating of the particles , the concentration of the polymers into the solvent ,  )",
    "the effective interaction potential between colloids can be suitably tuned in the experiments .",
    "it is possible to realize a hard - sphere system @xcite ; by adding non adsorbing polymers the hard - sphere interaction can be complemented by a short - range attraction , induced by depletion forces  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental works outlined that in some cases a residual net charge on the surface of colloidal particles may be present  @xcite , thereby inducing a long - range electrostatic repulsion screened by the presence of ions in the solution . the resulting effective interaction is therefore given by a hard - core term accounting for the excluded volume , a depletion - induced narrow attractive shell and a long - range repulsive shoulder .",
    "this kind of potential is well approximated by the dlvo ( after derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ) potential  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the parameters of the potential can be suitably tuned in the experiments .",
    "the depth of the attractive shell is controlled by the concentration of the polymers , @xmath0 , which therefore plays the role of an inverse temperature , whereas its range is proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colloids , @xmath1 , and the gyration radius of the polymers , @xmath2 ( typically one has @xmath3 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of salt increases the number of ions in the solution responsible for the screening of the electrostatic repulsion , thereby reducing the amplitude and increasing the screening length of the yukawa potential .",
    "charged colloids in polymeric solutions have recently raised a lot of interest , both from an experimental  @xcite and a theoretical  @xcite point of view . in these systems",
    "the competition between attractive and repulsive interactions on different length scales stabilizes the formation of aggregates of an optimal size and shape ( _ cluster phase _ ) , characterized by a peak of the structure factor around a typical wave vector , @xmath4 .",
    "experimentally , such cluster phase , made up by approximately monodisperse equilibrium aggregates , can be clearly observed using confocal microscopy at low volume fraction and low temperature ( high attraction strength )  @xcite . by appropriately tuning the control parameters ( i.e. , increasing the volume fraction or decreasing the temperature ) the system progressively evolves toward a gel - like non - ergodic disordered state  @xcite ( _ colloidal gelation _ ) , where structural arrest occurs .",
    "although intensely studied both experimentally and numerically , a theoretical understanding these phenomena is still lacking : the mechanisms inducing colloidal gelation are still unknown and many gaps remain in our present knowledge of the equilibrium phase diagram of these systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed that colloidal gelation is related to the formation of a wigner glass , whose blocks are compact and thermodynamically stable clusters , with a residual long - range repulsion between them . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was instead highlighted the percolative nature of the structural arrest in charged colloids , suggesting that percolation of a spanning network of clusters with long living bonds plays a crucial role .",
    "more recently , it has been suggested that the formation of partially ordered anisotropic domains and microphase structures may be responsible for physical gelation in these systems  @xcite .    in a recent letter  @xcite , we have introduced a @xmath5 model with competition between a short - range attraction , described by the ginzburg - landau hamiltonian , and a long - range screened repulsion , described by a yukawa potential  @xcite .",
    "albeit schematically , the model contains the essential features of the effective interaction potential among charged colloids in polymeric solutions and sheds new light on the structural properties of these systems .",
    "here we present a detailed and extensive analytical study of this model , and a full derivation and explanation of the results previously reported briefly in  @xcite .",
    "we show that depending on the control parameters , there is a region of the phase diagram where usual phase separation between a colloid - rich and a colloid - poor phase takes place .",
    "conversely , as the screening length and/or the strength of the repulsion exceeds a threshold value , phase separation is prevented . in this case , at moderately high temperature the competition between attraction and repulsion has the effect to produce microphase structures , i.e. , partially ordered modulated domains which in the terminology of particle systems , correspond to the cluster phase .",
    "these modulated structures are the precursors of a first order transition to an equilibrium lamellar phase found at lower temperatures . by using a replica approach for systems without quenched disorder  @xcite , and by employing the self - consistent screening approximation ( scsa )  @xcite",
    ", we also show the presence of a glass transition line in the low temperature region , once the first order transition to the lamellar phase is avoided .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the glass transition in this case turns out to be completely different from that of molecular glass - formers : as a matter of fact , we find that glassiness is not due to the presence of a hard - core interaction , which is totally absent in our model ; it is instead due to the formation of the microphase structures which order up to the size of correlation length .",
    "the geometric frustration , arising from arranging such modulated structures in a disordered fashion , leads to a complex free energy landscape and , consequently , to a dynamical slowing down .",
    "our results suggest that the cluster phase observed in colloidal suspensions should be followed , upon decreasing the temperature ( or increasing the volume fraction ) , by an equilibrium periodic phase ( a columnar or a lamellar phase , depending on the volume fraction ) .",
    "if , instead , this ordered phase is avoided , a structural arrest , corresponding to the gel phase observed in the experiments and in numerical simulations , should eventually occur .",
    "the existence of ordered phases in colloidal suspensions and the fact that the transition to the gel phase could occur in a metastable liquid , are novel predictions , which have never been considered before .",
    "recently , the presence of such ordered phases in atomistic model systems of charged colloids interacting via the dlvo potential , has been unambiguously shown both in three  @xcite and in two  @xcite dimensions .",
