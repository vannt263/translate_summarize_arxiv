    "<S> we investigate the phantom field with potential @xmath0 and dark matter in the spatially flat frw model . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown by numerical calculation that there is a attractor solution in this model . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the statefinder diagnostic to this phantom model . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the evolving trajectories of this scenario in the @xmath1 diagram is quite different form other dark energy models .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae@xcite reveal the speeding up expansion of our universe and the surveys of clusters of galaxies show that the density of matter is very much less than the critical density@xcite , and the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicate that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical one with @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these three tests nicely complement each other and indicate that the dominated component of the present universe is dark energy(de ) . </S>",
    "<S> dark energy occupies about @xmath3 of the energy of our universe , while dark matter(dm ) about @xmath4 , and the usual baryonic matter occupy about @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerating expansion of the present universe is attributed to the dark energy which is an exotic component with negative pressure , such as the cosmological constant @xmath6 @xcite with equation of state @xmath7 , a dynamically evolving scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite with @xmath8 or the phantom @xcite with @xmath9 , meanwhile the accelerating expansion of universe can also be obtained through modified firedmann equation@xcite and brane world@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fine tuning problem is considered as one of the most important issues for dark energy models and a good model should limit the fine tuning as much as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical attractors of the cosmological system have been employed to make the late time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial conditions of the field and thus alleviate the fine tuning problem , which has been studied in many quintessence models @xcite . in phantom system , this problem has been studied with cosine potential@xcite , exponential and inverse power law potential in @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we study the phantom field @xmath10 with the potential @xmath0 and the dark matter in the spatially flat frw model . </S>",
    "<S> the late time behavior of the cosmological equations will give accelerated expansion and a constant ratio between dark matter energy density @xmath11 and phantom energy density @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior relies on the existence of an attractor solution , and the late time cosmology insensitive to the initial conditions for dark matter and dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the fine tuning problem can be alleviate in this model .    in this paper , we will first show the attractor behavior in this scenario and , then we perform a statefinder parameter diagnostic for this model . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder parameter introduced by sahni et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are proven to be useful tools to characterize and differentiate between various dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this paper the evolving trajectory of the @xmath1 diagram is quite different from this of other dark energy models .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a universe model which contains phantom field @xmath10 and the dark matter @xmath11 . the friedmann equation in a spatially flat frw metric can be written as @xmath13 the planck normalization @xmath14 has been used here , @xmath11 is the energy density of the dark matter , and the dark matter possesses the equation of state @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density and pressure of the phantom field @xmath10 are @xmath12 and @xmath16 , respectively , @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the phantom field potential , @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the energy of dark energy and dark matter is conserved respectively , the equation of motion for de and dm can be obtained : @xmath20 @xmath21 where the parameter of equation of state for the phantom field is given by : @xmath22 and we can get the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath10 @xmath23    using the friedmann equation eq.([h^2 ] ) , the eq.([scalar ] ) can be written as @xmath24\\phi^{'}=-2\\lambda{\\phi}v(\\phi).\\label{u}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the redshift , and @xmath28 represents the current scalar factor .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the attractor solution can be found analytically in the exponential potential . however , in our case , it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the late time behavior of the field is not linear in potential of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> now , we will solve the equation of motion of @xmath10 numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results show that there exists a stable attractor solution which depends on @xmath29 while is insensitive to the initial conditions . in fig.[plane ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot the @xmath30 phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in the phase plane that the lines corresponding to different conditions will converge together to the attractor solution with the cosmological evolution . in fig.[omega ] , we plot the evolution energy density parameters of dark matter and dark energy with @xmath31 , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it is exhibited that the dark energy occupies about @xmath33 and dark matter occupies about @xmath34 at present , and the ratio between energy densities of de and dm will remain constant in the future . at late time , the universe will be dominated by the phantom field alone . from fig.[w ] we can see that the parameter of equation of state of phantom less than @xmath35 at present , while it will approach to @xmath35 in the future .    </S>",

    "<S> the statefinder is a `` geometrical '' diagnostic in the sense that it depends on the expansion factor and hence on the metric describing space - time . since different cosmological models involving dark energy exhibit qualitatively different evolution trajectories in the @xmath1 plane , this statefinder diagnostic can differentiate various kinds of dark energy models . for the spatially flat lcdm cosmological model , </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point @xmath42 . by far some models , including the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , quintom , the chaplygin gas , braneworld models , holographic models , interacting and coupling dark energy models @xcite , have been successfully differentiated . for example , the quintessence model with inverse power law potential , the phantom model with power law potential and the chaplygin gas model all tend to approach the lcdm fixed point , but for quintessence and phantom models the trajectories lie in the regions @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we use another form of statefinder parameters in terms of the total energy density @xmath44 and the total pressure @xmath45 in the universe : @xmath46 since the energy density of de and dm is conserved , from ( [ de ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) we can get : @xmath47 where @xmath48 . and </S>",
    "<S> the deceleration parameter is also given @xmath49 in fig.[sr ] , we show the time evolution of the statefinder pair @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot is for variable interval @xmath50 $ ] , and the selected evolution trajectories of @xmath51 correspond to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath38 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the @xmath39 exists in @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the trajectories will pass through lcdm fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> it is interest to find that the scope of @xmath39 would be largened with the increasing of the @xmath29 , and in the future , the curves will approach to the lcdm fixed point , which is quite different from other phantom models with the exponential and pow law potential . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the statefinder pair @xmath54 in the fig.[qr ] , in which the corresponding parameters are the same as in the fig.[sr ] . </S>",
