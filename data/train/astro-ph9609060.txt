    "absorption lines in quasar spectra , especially the `` forest '' of ly@xmath0  lines produced by concentrations of neutral hydrogen , are uniquely suited for probing structure formation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "recent cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photoionization reproduce many of the observed features of quasar absorption spectra , suggesting that the ly@xmath0  forest arises as a natural consequence of hierarchical structure formation in a universe with a photoionizing uv background ( cen et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter hkwm ) .",
    "meanwhile , high - precision observations made using the hires spectrograph on the 10 m keck telescope have quantified the statistics of the low column density absorbers to unprecedented accuracy ( e.g. , hu et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter hkcsr ) .",
    "most of the lines found in hires spectra are weak absorbers with column densities @xmath7 . in order to compare to published line population statistics from hires data , it is essential to analyze the simulated spectra by voigt - profile decomposition .",
    "here we compare simulated ly@xmath0  spectra from a simulation of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario to hkcsr using an automated voigt - profile fitting algorithm .",
    "the results presented here are a condensed version of those in dav et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the physical model implicit in the decomposition technique is that of a collection of discrete , compact clouds , each characterized by a single velocity dispersion ( thermal and/or turbulent ) .",
    "the simulations undermine this physical picture because the absorbing systems merge continuously into a smoothly fluctuating background , often contain gas at a range of temperatures , and are usually broadened in frequency space by coherent velocity flows that do not resemble gaussian turbulence .",
    "nonetheless , any spectrum can be described phenomenologically by a superposition of voigt - profile lines , with the number of components increasing as the signal - to - noise ratio improves and more subtle features must be matched .",
    "the distributions of fitted column densities and @xmath4-parameters provide a useful statistical basis for comparing simulations and observations , and this is the approach that we adopt in these proceedings .",
    "the simulation analyzed here has the same initial conditions , cosmological parameters , and numerical parameters as that of hkwm ( the reader is referred there for more details ) : a cdm universe with @xmath1 , @xmath8  km  s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , baryon fraction @xmath10 , @xmath11 , ( roughly the value required to reproduce observed galaxy cluster masses ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ) , in a periodic simulation cube 22.222 comoving mpc on a side .",
    "we generate artificial spectra at @xmath12 and @xmath3 along 300 random lines of sight through the simulation cube , using the methods described in hkwm and cen et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    instead of the @xmath13 uv background spectrum adopted by hkwm",
    ", we use the spectrum of haardt & madau ( 1996 ; hereafter hm ) , which is computed as a function of redshift based on the uv output of observed quasars and reprocessing by the observed ly@xmath0  forest . the mean opacity of the ly@xmath0  forest depends on the parameter combination @xmath14 .",
    "since observational determinations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 remain quite uncertain , we treat the overall intensity of the uv background as a free parameter and scale it to match the mean ly@xmath0  optical depth of press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 ; hereafter prs ) of @xmath17 . in order to do this at @xmath3 with the original hm background intensity , we require @xmath18 , in better agreement with tytler , fan , & burles ( 1996 ) .",
    "once @xmath14 is set , there is no further freedom to adjust the simulation predictions , and the remaining properties of the ly@xmath0  forest provide tests of the cosmological scenario .",
    "we want the analysis of our simulated spectra to closely match that used in typical observational studies , hkcsr in particular .",
    "to this end , we have developed an automated voigt - profile fitting routine , autovp , which allows us to efficiently handle large quantities of simulated data and which provides an objective algorithm that can be applied to real data .",
    "we first add noise ( @xmath19 ) to our simulated spectra .",
    "we then estimate the continuum in the simulated spectra , neglecting our _ a priori _ knowledge of it",
    ". finally we apply autovp to detect lines and fit voigt profiles . in its first phase",
    ", autovp identifies lines and makes an initial estimate of their column densities and @xmath4-parameters , and in its second phase , autovp takes the initial guess and performs a simultaneous @xmath20-minimization on the parameters ( @xmath21 ) of all lines within each detection region .",
    "three independent minimization techniques are employed in conjunction in order to reliably identify the global @xmath20 minimum , and lines are added or removed based on formal significance criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : col ] shows the column density distribution      @xmath22 , the number of lines per unit redshift per linear interval of @xmath23 .",
    "solid and dashed lines show the simulation results from autovp at @xmath3 and @xmath12 , respectively . filled and open circles in figure  [ fig : col ] show the observational results of pwrcl and hkcsr , respectively .",
    "we compute the hkcsr @xmath22 directly from their published line list , with no corrections for `` incompleteness . ''",
    "the mean redshift of the hkcsr lines is @xmath24 , so the closest comparison is to the @xmath3 simulation results . to make this comparison more exact",
    ", we convolved the @xmath3 artificial spectra to a resolution @xmath25  ( @xmath26 ) before applying autovp .",
    "when analyzed by voigt - profile decomposition , the simulation overproduces the number of lines by a factor of @xmath27 in the column density range @xmath28 .",
    "this excess of lines may therefore indicate a failure of the @xmath1 , @xmath11 cdm model .",
    "an alternative possibility , quite plausible at present , is that we have set the intensity of the uv background too low given our adopted value of @xmath15 .",
    "if we adjust our intensity to force agreement with hkcsr s @xmath22 distribution , this lowers the mean optical depth to @xmath29 .",
    "this is well outside the @xmath30 range of prs ( figure  4 ) , but is somewhat _ above _",
    "the value @xmath31 found by zuo & lu ( 1993 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of our conclusions highlights the need for better observational determinations of @xmath32 ; if @xmath33 is well known then the amplitude of @xmath22 becomes an independent test of the high - redshift structure predicted by a cosmological model .",
    "figure  [ fig : col](b ) shows the distribution of @xmath4-parameters for lines with @xmath34 from hkcsr ( solid histogram ) and from the autovp analyses of the simulation at @xmath3 and @xmath12 ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "we only use lines with @xmath34 , which eliminates lines whose identification and derived properties are sensitive to the value of @xmath35 or to details of the fitting procedure . we find that distribution mean , median , and dispersion are 34.6 , 39.3 , and 20.8 @xmath36 , respectively . from hkcsr line lists we obtain corresponding values of 31.4 , 35.8 , and 16.3 @xmath36 ; while systematically lower , the agreement is reasonable given that the analysis procedures are not identical in all their details .",
    "the most significant difference in the distributions is the presence of more narrow ( @xmath37 ) lines in the simulation than in the data .",
    "a possible explanation is that our equilibrium treatment of photoionization suppresses heating that can occur during rapid reionization ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) .    in summary ,",
    "a voigt - profile decomposition of simulated spectra in a cdm universe reproduces the column density and @xmath4-parameter distributions from keck data reasonably well .",
    "sharper tests of cosmological models against the statistics of the ly@xmath0  forest can be obtained by expanding the redshift range of comparisons , by improving the determination of @xmath32 , and by applying autovp to observational data , so that the analyses of simulated and observed spectra are identical in detail .",
    "more interestingly , we are investigating different characterizations of line profiles which more accurately describe the physical state of the gas .",
    "while the spectra can always be fit within a discrete `` cloud '' model by postulating just the right clustering properties , the ubiquitous asymmetries and non - gaussian features in the line profiles more likely signify the breakdown of the voigt - profile paradigm itself , revealing the origin of the ly@xmath0  forest in the diffuse , undulating gas distribution of the high - redshift universe .",
