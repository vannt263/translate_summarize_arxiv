    "the geometrization conjecture and its resolution illustrate how closely the topology and the geometry of closed @xmath0-manifolds are related .",
    "however , many specific mechanisms through which curvature restricts the geometry of @xmath0-manifolds remain to be explored . in this paper , we are concerned with @xmath0-manifolds that have an abundance of flat tangent planes at every point .",
    "namely , we study how the global arrangement of these flat planes constrains the geometry and topology of the underlying @xmath0-manifold .",
    "a classical measure of how many flat planes a riemannian manifold @xmath1 has is given by its _",
    "rank _ , defined as the least number of linearly independent parallel jacobi fields along geodesics of @xmath1 . since the velocity field along a geodesic is a parallel jacobi field , all manifolds have rank at least one .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 is said to have _ higher rank _ if it has rank at least @xmath2 .",
    "the geodesics of a manifold with rank @xmath3 infinitesimally appear to lie in a copy of @xmath4-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the presence of parallel jacobi fields encodes global information about the geometric arrangement of flat planes . under so - called _ rank rigidity _",
    "conditions , these infinitesimal variations integrate to totally geodesic flat submanifolds , imposing a rigid structure on @xmath1 .    our first and main result is a characterization of higher rank @xmath0-manifolds :    [ thm : a ] a complete @xmath0-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath1 has higher rank if and only if its universal covering splits isometrically as @xmath5 .    to our knowledge , this is the first rank rigidity theorem that only assumes completeness of the riemannian metric .",
    "besides not requiring any curvature bounds , the above result applies to both closed and open @xmath0-manifolds , including those of infinite volume .",
    "this flexibility is possible because we restrict to manifolds of low dimension .",
    "in fact , a simple argument shows that higher rank @xmath0-manifolds have _ pointwise signed sectional curvatures _ ; i.e. , for each @xmath6 the sectional curvatures of @xmath2-planes in @xmath7 are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive ( see proposition  [ prop : signed ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , no global structural results for manifolds with @xmath8 or @xmath9 apply , since the sign of the curvature may change with the point .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for another instance in which flat surfaces in riemannian @xmath0-manifolds are the source of rigidity in an otherwise curvature - free setting .",
    "historically , rank rigidity results first appeared in the context of manifolds with @xmath10 .",
    "ballmann  @xcite , and independently burns and spatzier  @xcite , proved that finite - volume manifolds with bounded nonpositive curvature and higher rank are either locally symmetric or have reducible universal covering .",
    "the lower bound on curvature was later removed by eberlein and heber  @xcite , who also relaxed the finite - volume condition .",
    "recently , watkins  @xcite proved a generalization of these results in the context of manifolds with no focal points .",
    "in contrast , fewer rank rigidity results are known for manifolds with lower sectional curvature bounds @xcite , particularly @xmath11 . a detailed investigation of rank rigidity in this curvature setting",
    "may have been stalled due to examples of spatzier and strake  @xcite of @xmath12-dimensional manifolds with @xmath11 and higher rank that have irreducible universal covering and are not homotopy equivalent to a compact locally homogeneous space .",
    "it is worth mentioning that rank rigidity has also been extensively studied with different signs on sectional curvature bounds , with analogous definitions of _ spherical _ and _ hyperbolic _ rank , see @xcite .    in order to understand the local structure of higher rank @xmath0-manifolds",
    ", we first analyze a _",
    "version of having higher rank . following schmidt and wolfson  @xcite",
    ", we say that a riemannian manifold @xmath1 has _ constant vector curvature zero _ , abbreviated @xmath13 , if every tangent vector to @xmath1 is contained in a flat plane .",
    "higher rank manifolds clearly have @xmath13 . indeed ,",
    "any @xmath14 is the initial velocity of the geodesic @xmath15 , which , by the higher rank condition , admits a normal parallel jacobi field @xmath16 hence satisfying @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "notice that the @xmath13 hypothesis alone is a ( strictly ) weaker notion of having many flat planes , since there is no control on the global arrangement of these flat planes across the manifold , differently from the higher rank situation .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath13 have a canonical decomposition as the union of the subset @xmath19 of _ isotropic points _ , at which all planes are flat , and its complement , the subset @xmath20 of _ nonisotropic points_. when @xmath1 has pointwise signed sectional curvatures , we have either @xmath11 or @xmath10 on each connected component @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "this imposes _ pointwise _ rigidity on the geometric arrangement of flat planes , encoded as a singular tangent distribution on unit tangent spheres that we call _ flat planes distribution _ ( see definition  [ def : flatplanesdistr ] ) .",
    "the paucity of totally geodesic singular tangent distributions with codimension @xmath23 on a round @xmath2-sphere ( see figure  [ fig : zeroplanesdistr ] ) is the source of such rigidity . in particular",
    ", it follows that @xmath21 has a naturally defined line field @xmath24 such that a plane in @xmath7 , @xmath25 , is flat if and only if it contains the line @xmath26 , see lemma  [ lemma : cvc ] . from structural results in @xcite , @xmath24 is tangent to a foliation of @xmath21 by complete geodesics , and @xmath24 is parallel if @xmath21 has finite volume .",
    "note that if @xmath24 is known to be parallel on @xmath21 , then the de rham decomposition theorem provides a local product decomposition on @xmath21 .    before outlining the strategy to prove our main result ,",
    "let us mention a few examples of @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath13 that violate its conclusion .",
    "we start with examples of complete warped product metrics on @xmath27 that have @xmath13 but are not isometric to a product metric , due to sekigawa  @xcite .",
    "these examples are curvature homogeneous , with curvature model @xmath28 ; in particular , they have @xmath10 and constant scalar curvature . in such examples ,",
    "@xmath1 consists only of nonisotropic points and hence the line field @xmath24 is globally defined , but not parallel .",
    "the classical rank @xmath29 graph manifolds of gromov  @xcite provide examples of @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath13 and @xmath10 . in these examples ,",
    "the isotropic points separate the manifold in at least two components of nonisotropic points , where the line field @xmath24 is parallel .",
    "however , this line field is not the restriction of a globally defined parallel line field , and the local product structure given by the de rham decomposition theorem can not be globalized .",
    "this originates from the geometric arrangement of flat planes being locally compatible ( within each nonisotropic component ) , but not globally compatible .",
    "we observe that similar examples also exist among @xmath11",
    ". these can be constructed on both closed and open @xmath0-manifolds by gluing product manifolds with boundary , proving :    [ thm : b ] the sphere @xmath30 , all lens spaces @xmath31 , and @xmath32 admit complete riemannian metrics with @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and irreducible universal covering",
    ".    informed by the above examples , we must use the additional information on the _ global _ arrangement of flat planes to prove that a higher rank @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 has reducible universal covering .",
    "the two main steps are to show that the line field @xmath24 is parallel on each connected component of @xmath22 and extendable to a globally defined parallel line field on @xmath1 . in order to implement this strategy",
    ", the key observation is that , on a higher rank manifold @xmath1 , the domains @xmath33 , @xmath34 , admit a canonical _ open book decomposition _ with totally geodesic flat pages and binding @xmath35 , see figure  [ figure : flats ] .",
    "concretely , this decomposition is obtained by exponentiating the linear open book decomposition of @xmath7 given by the union of @xmath2-planes that contain the line @xmath26 , see proposition  [ prop : flats ] .    to achieve the first step ,",
    "the open book decomposition is used to show that @xmath36 is a totally geodesic distribution ( see corollary  [ corollary : perptotgeo ] ) .",
    "this , combined with an evolution equation for the shape operators of @xmath37 along @xmath35 , implies that @xmath24 is parallel in each nonisotropic component ( see proposition  [ prop : totgeoandparallel ] ) .    to achieve the second step , note that the geodesic @xmath35 generates a parallel line foliation of each flat page of the open book decomposition .",
    "the union of these parallel line foliations over pages extends @xmath24 across isotropic points to a parallel line field on @xmath38 ( see proposition  [ prop : keyprop2 ] ) .",
    "as illustrated by the above mentioned examples , the higher rank hypothesis in theorem  [ thm : a ] can not be relaxed to @xmath13 , even under the additional assumption of pointwise signed sectional curvatures .",
    "we remark that the examples in theorem  [ thm : b ] use smooth metrics which are _ not real - analytic _ , while the examples of sekigawa  @xcite are real - analytic , but have _ infinite volume_. our final result shows that if @xmath1 is a @xmath0-manifold with @xmath13 and pointwise signed sectional curvatures on which both of these behaviors are avoided , then the universal covering of @xmath1 is reducible .",
    "[ thm : c ] let @xmath1 be a complete @xmath0-dimensional real - analytic riemannian manifold with finite volume and pointwise signed sectional curvatures . if @xmath1 has @xmath13 , then its universal covering splits isometrically as @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude by remarking that , despite the above examples and rigidity results , there are no obvious topological obstructions for @xmath0-manifolds to admit a metric with @xmath13 and pointwise signed sectional curvatures .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the stronger notion of @xmath0-manifolds with higher rank .",
