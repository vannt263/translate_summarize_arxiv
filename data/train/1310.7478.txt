    "neutrino oscillations have been measured with high accuracy in solar , atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . hence , we know that neutrinos are massive and mixed particles ( see @xcite ) . in this short review",
    "we discuss the status of the standard three - neutrino mixing paradigm ( section  [ three ] ) and the indications in favor of the existence of additional sterile neutrinos given by anomalies found in some short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ( section  [ beyond ] ) .",
    "solar neutrino experiments ( homestake , kamiokande , gallex / gno , sage , super - kamiokande , sno , borexino ) measured @xmath0 oscillations generated by the solar squared - mass difference @xmath1 and a mixing angle @xmath2 .",
    "the kamland experiment confirmed these oscillations by observing the disappearance of reactor @xmath3 at an average distance of about 180 km .",
    "atmospheric neutrino experiments ( kamiokande , imb , super - kamiokande , macro , soudan-2 , minos ) measured @xmath4 and @xmath5 disappearance through oscillations generated by the atmospheric squared - mass difference @xmath6 and a mixing angle @xmath7 . the k2k and minos long - baseline experiments confirmed these oscillations by observing the disappearance of accelerator @xmath4 at distances of about 250 km and 730 km , respectively .    the two independent solar and atmospheric @xmath8 s are nicely accommodated in the standard framework of three - neutrino mixing in which the three active flavor neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 are superpositions of three neutrinos @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 with masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 : @xmath17 , for @xmath18 . the unitary mixing matrix can be written in the standard parameterization in terms of three mixing angles @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and a cp - violating phase @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the numbers of the massive neutrinos in order to have @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "then , there are two possible hierarchies for the neutrino masses : the normal hierarchy ( nh ) with @xmath28 and the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) with @xmath29 .    with the conventions in eqs .",

    ". moreover , the mixing angle @xmath21 generates @xmath32 disappearance and @xmath33 transitions driven by @xmath34 , which can be observed in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .    in 2011",
    "the t2k experiment reported the first indication of long - baseline @xmath35 transitions @xcite , followed by the minos experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , the t2k collaboration reported a convincing @xmath36 observation of @xmath35 transitions through the measurement of 28 @xmath9 events with an expected background of @xmath37 events @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the most precise measurement of the value of @xmath21 comes from the measurement of @xmath3 disappearance in the daya bay reactor experiment @xcite , which has been confirmed by the data of the reno @xcite and double chooz @xcite reactor experiments : @xmath38 hence , we have a robust evidence of a non - zero value of @xmath21 , which is very important , because the measured value of @xmath21 opens promising perspectives for the observation of cp violation in the lepton sector and matter effects in long - baseline oscillation experiments , which could allow to distinguish the normal and inverted neutrino mass spectra ( see @xcite ) .    as a result of all these observations of neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the mixing parameters can be determined with good precision by a global fit of the data @xcite .",
    "the most recent result is nufit - v1.2 @xcite : @xmath39 hence , the squared - mass differences are known with good precision : about @xmath40 for both @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the mixing parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are known , respectively , with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 precision . currently , the most puzzling uncertainty is that of the mixing angle @xmath20 , which is known to be close to the maximal mixing value of @xmath49 , but we do not know if it is smaller or larger .",
    "we conclude this section noting a small tension between reactor and accelerator measurements of the @xmath21 angle . it may be reconciled within the three - neutrino mixing scheme by fitting the phase @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , from an experimental point of view , t2k shows an anomalous event vertex distribution of electron like events , with the events concentrated near the border of the detector @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the three - neutrino mixing paradigm has been challenged by the following indications in favor of short - baseline neutrino oscillations , which require the existence of at least one additional squared - mass difference , @xmath50 , which is much larger than @xmath51 and @xmath52 : a ) the lsnd experiment , in which a signal of short - baseline @xmath53 oscillations has been observed with a statistical significance of about @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "b ) the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , which is a @xmath55 deficit of the rate of @xmath3 observed in several short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments in comparison with that expected from a new calculation of the reactor neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "c ) the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite , consisting in a short - baseline disappearance of @xmath9 measured in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex and sage with a statistical significance of about @xmath56 .    in this review , we consider 3 + 1 @xcite and 3 + 2 @xcite neutrino mixing schemes in which there are one or two additional massive neutrinos at the ev scale and the masses of the three standard massive neutrinos are much smaller . since from the lep measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath57 boson we know that there are only three active neutrinos ( see @xcite ) , in the flavor basis the additional massive neutrinos correspond to sterile neutrinos @xcite , which do not have standard weak interactions .    in the 3 + 1 scheme ,",
    "the effective probability of @xmath58 transitions in short - baseline experiments has the two - neutrino - like form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mixing matrix , @xmath61 is the source - detector distance , @xmath62 is the neutrino energy and @xmath63 .",
    "the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino appearance and disappearance in short - baseline experiments depend on @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which determine the amplitude @xmath66 of @xmath33 transitions , the amplitude @xmath67 of @xmath32 disappearance , and the amplitude @xmath68 of @xmath69 disappearance .",
    "since the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos are related by a complex conjugation of the elements of the mixing matrix ( see @xcite ) , the effective probabilities of short - baseline @xmath35 and @xmath53 transitions are equal .",
    "hence , the 3 + 1 scheme can not explain a possible cp - violating difference of @xmath35 and @xmath53 transitions in short - baseline experiments . in order to allow this possibility",
    ", one must consider a 3 + 2 scheme , in which , there are four additional effective mixing parameters in short - baseline experiments : @xmath70 , which is conventionally assumed @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "since this complex phase appears with different signs in the effective 3 + 2 probabilities of short - baseline @xmath35 and @xmath53 transitions , it can generate measurable cp violations .    .",

    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we summarize the results of the analysis of short - baseline data in the 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 schemes presented in ref .",
    "the statistical results are listed in table  [ tab : chi ] . in",
    "the low fits all the miniboone data are considered , including the anomalous low - energy bins , which are omitted in the hig fits .",
    "there is also a 3 + 1-nomb fit without miniboone data and a 3 + 1-nolsnd fit without lsnd data .    from tab .",
    "[ tab : chi ] , one can see that in all fits which include the lsnd data the absence of short - baseline oscillations is disfavored by about @xmath81 , because the improvement of the @xmath82 with short - baseline oscillations is much larger than the number of oscillation parameters .    in both the 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 schemes ,",
    "the goodness - of - fit in the low analysis is significantly worse than that in the hig analysis and the appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit is much worse .",
    "this result confirms the fact that the miniboone low - energy anomaly is incompatible with neutrino oscillations , because it would require a small value of @xmath83 and a large value of @xmath84 which are excluded by the data of other experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "note that the appearance - disappearance tension in the 3 + 2-low fit is even worse than that in the 3 + 1-low fit , since the @xmath85 is so much larger that it can not be compensated by the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , we think that it is very likely that the miniboone low - energy anomaly has an explanation which is different from neutrino oscillations and the hig fits are more reliable than the low fits .    the 3 + 2 mixing scheme , was considered to be interesting in 2010 when the miniboone neutrino @xcite and antineutrino @xcite data showed a cp - violating tension .",
    "unfortunately , this tension reduced considerably in the final miniboone data @xcite and from tab .",
    "[ tab : chi ] one can see that there is little improvement of the 3 + 2-hig fit with respect to the 3 + 1-hig fit , in spite of the four additional parameters and the additional possibility of cp violation .",
    "moreover , since the p - value obtained by restricting the 3 + 2 scheme to 3 + 1 disfavors the 3 + 1 scheme only at @xmath86 @xcite , we think that considering the larger complexity of the 3 + 2 scheme is not justified by the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : glo ] shows the allowed regions in the @xmath87@xmath88 , @xmath89@xmath88 and @xmath90@xmath88 planes obtained in the 3 + 1-hig fit of ref .",
    "these regions are relevant , respectively , for @xmath33 appearance , @xmath32 disappearance and @xmath69 disappearance searches .",
    "figure  [ fig : glo ] shows also the region allowed by @xmath33 appearance data and the constraints from @xmath32 disappearance and @xmath69 disappearance data .",
    "one can see that the combined disappearance constraint in the @xmath87@xmath88 plane excludes a large part of the region allowed by @xmath33 appearance data , leading to the well - known appearance - disappearance tension quantified by the parameter goodness - of - fit in tab .",
    "[ tab : chi ] .",
    "it is interesting to investigate what is the impact of the miniboone experiment on the global analysis of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data . with this aim , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite performed two additional 3 + 1 fits : a 3 + 1-nomb fit without miniboone data and a 3 + 1-nolsnd fit without lsnd data . from tab .",
    "[ tab : chi ] one can see that the results of the 3 + 1-nomb fit are similar to those of the 3 + 1-hig fit and the exclusion of the case of no - oscillations remains at the level of @xmath81 . on the other hand , in the 3 + 1-nolsnd fit , without lsnd data , the exclusion of the case of no - oscillations drops dramatically to @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , in this case the main indication in favor of short - baseline oscillations is given by the reactor and gallium anomalies which have a similar statistical significance .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the lsnd experiment is still crucial for the indication in favor of short - baseline @xmath53 transitions and the miniboone experiment has been rather inconclusive .",
    "the current status of our knowledge of three - neutrino mixing is very satisfactory after the recent determination of the smallest mixing angle @xmath21 : the two squared - mass differences and the three mixing angles are known with good precision .",
    "future experiments must determine if @xmath20 is smaller or larger than @xmath49 , the value of the dirac cp - violating phase in the mixing matrix , the mass hierarchy and the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "it is also very important to find if neutrinos are majorana particles and in that case what are the values of the majorana cp - violating phases .",
    "anomalies which can not be explained in the framework of three - neutrino mixing and require the existence of sterile neutrinos have been observed by some short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the results of the global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the data can be explained by 3 + 1 neutrino mixing and this simplest scheme beyond three - neutrino mixing can not be rejected in favor of the more complex 3 + 2 scheme . the low - energy miniboone anomaly can not be explained by neutrino oscillations in any of these schemes .",
    "moreover , the crucial indication in favor of short - baseline @xmath53 appearance is still given by the old lsnd data and the miniboone experiment has been inconclusive . hence new better experiments are needed in order to check this signal ."
