    "@xcite and eq .   proposed by parkhomchuk . the deviations of eq .",
    "from the esr data , which can be seen in figs .  [ fig:2 ] and",
    "[ fig:3 ] , are ascribed to the deviations of the model distribution function   from the experimental distribution of the ion beam which is not precisely known .    as the main goal of this paper",
    "we suggest a more advanced analytical model for calculations of the cooling force which is appropriate for modeling many experimental situations with moderate or strong magnetic guiding fields . in principle , the average involved in eq .   can also be done numerically with recorded ion beam distributions or analytically using other ion distributions like e.g. the parabolic distribution function as it occurs in celsius  @xcite .",
    "systematic comparisons for different distribution functions and other experiments on electron cooling as well as with monte carlo numerical simulations are currently in progress and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
