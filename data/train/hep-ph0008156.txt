    "one of the main goals of future @xmath12 and @xmath13 colliders such as the next linear collider ( nlc ) and the future muon collider ( fmc ) will be to measure and to determine the properties of the top quark which was first discovered at the tevatron  @xcite with a mass of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "although the top quark will be studied at the lhc and the tevatron ( run - ii ) with an expected accuracy for the mass of @xmath15 , the _ most accurate measurement _ of the mass with an accuracy of @xmath16 ( @xmath3 ) is expected to be obtained only at the nlc  @xcite .    due to the large top quark width",
    ", the top - antitop pair can not hadronize into toponium resonances .",
    "the cross section appears therefore to have a smooth line - shape showing only a moderate @xmath17 peak .",
    "in addition the top quark width serves as an infrared cutoff  @xcite and as a natural smearing over the energy  @xcite . as a result , the nonperturbative qcd effects induced by the gluon condensate are small  @xcite , allowing us to calculate the cross section with high accuracy by using perturbative qcd even in the threshold region .",
    "many theoretical studies at lo and nlo have been done in the past for the total cross section  @xcite , for the momentum distribution  @xcite , also accounting for electro - weak corrections  @xcite , and for the complete nlo correction including non - factorizable corrections  @xcite .",
    "recently , the nnlo analysis of the inclusive threshold production cross section has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the results of the nnlo analysis are summarized in a review article  @xcite . to summarize the results for a standard approach using the pole mass , the nnlo corrections are uncomfortably large , spoiling the possibility for the top quark mass extraction at nlc with good accuracy because the @xmath17 peak is shifted by about @xmath18 by the nnlo , the last known correction .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is the usage of the pole mass in the calculations .",
    "it was realized that such type of instability is caused by the fact that the pole mass is a badly defined object within full qcd  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a definition of the quark mass alternative to the pole mass .",
    "we call it @xmath2 mass because in the static limit this mass coincides with the potential subtracted ( ps ) mass , even though the ps mass is defined in a different manner  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we include both of them in this paper .",
    "the ratio of the small normalization point and the mass introduce relativistic corrections ( called recoil corrections ) which result in the difference between the two masses at higher orders in @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the pole mass , the ps and the @xmath2 mass are not sensitive to non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "we derive recoil corrections to the relation of the pole mass to the @xmath2 mass and demonstrate that perturbative predictions for the cross section become much more stable at higher orders of qcd ( shifts are below @xmath19 ) if we use the ps or @xmath2 mass for the calculations , as it is the case for any of the other threshold masses .",
    "this understanding removes one of the obstacles for the accurate top quark mass measurement and it can be expected that the top quark mass will be extracted from a threshold scan at nlc with an accuracy of about @xmath3 .",
    "the necessity of isolating the ir contributions in the mass calculation and the consideration of a short distance mass have been studied intensively  @xcite .",
    "the applications of the ps , ls and @xmath17 mass have been reported recently by several groups  @xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    ". the detailed comparison of our results using the ps mass with results of other groups have been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite so that we refer the reader to this reference for details .",
    "this paper is therefore devoted to two subjects .",
    "first , we define the @xmath2 mass which allows us to calculate recoil corrections near the threshold .",
    "second , we calculate the cross section for @xmath1 near threshold with nnlo accuracy using three alternative mass concepts , i.e.(1 ) the pole mass , ( 2 ) the static ps mass , and ( 3 ) the new @xmath2 mass . the results of the first approach has already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the _ preliminary _ results for the top quark pair production near threshold using the static ps mass were presented at the workshop `` physics at linear colliders ''  @xcite by one of the authors .",
    "the results on the second and third alternative concepts which we present here are new .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we give the definition of the @xmath2 mass in terms of the soft part of the self energy and calculate the leading order contribution . in sec .",
    "3 we calculate the two - loop corrections and present our final result . in sec .",
    "4 we use the obtained results for the analysis of the top quark pair production . in sec .",
    "5 we give our conclusions .",
    "the appendix contains explicit expressions for the coefficients which occur in the text .",
    "the top quark mass is an input parameter of the standard model .",
    "although it is widely accepted that the quark masses are generated due to the higgs mechanism , the value of the mass can not be calculated from the standard model . instead",
    ", quark masses have to be determined from the comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "it is important to stress that there is no unique definition of the quark mass .",
    "because the quark can not be observed as a free particle like the electron , the quark mass is a purely theoretical notion and depends on the concept adopted for its definition .",
    "the best known definitions are the pole mass and the @xmath20 mass .",
    "however , both definitions are not adequate for the analysis of top quark production near threshold .",
    "the pole mass should not be used because it has the renormalon ambiguity and can not be determined more accurately than @xmath21  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the @xmath22 mass is an euclidean mass , defined at high virtuality , and therefore destroys the non - relativistic expansion .",
    "instead , it was recently suggested to use threshold masses like the low scale ( ls ) mass  @xcite , the potential subtracted ( ps ) mass  @xcite , or one half of the perturbative mass of a fictious @xmath23 ground state ( called @xmath17 mass ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the static ps mass suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the quark - antiquark coulomb potential .",
    "in order to understand why this mass definition is more adequate than the pole mass and to see that the pole mass is very sensitive to long distance effects , it is enough to consider the one - loop expression for the self energy diagram . taking the residue in @xmath26 , one obtains a soft self energy contribution which comes from momenta @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 we observe that the pole mass has a non - perturbative uncertainty of order @xmath30 which then penetrates into consequent perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "it is easy to realize that the ps mass is free of this ambiguity .",
    "indeed , the term @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ critical ] ) cancels in the definition of the ps mass as given in eq .",
    "( [ defps ] ) as well as in the combination @xmath32 . the definition in eq .",
    "( [ defps ] ) has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite but has already been discussed implicitly in ref .",
    "the remarkable step made in ref .",
    "@xcite is to use this definition beyond one - loop order .",
    "it has been proven in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cancellation of the infrared qcd contributions to the ps mass in eq .",
    "( [ defps ] ) holds even at higher loop orders .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a natural definition of a short distance quark mass near threshold .",
    "our objective is that the definition should be gauge independent and well - defined within quantum field theory so that radiative and relativistic corrections can be calculated in a systematic way .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that both concepts , as well as the other concepts mentioned before , are equivalently applicable to considerations near the quark production threshold .",
    "we define @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the soft part of the heavy quark self energy which is defined as the part where at least one of the heavy quark propagators is on - shell .",
    "a more precise definition is given below .",
    "we will show that the static ps mass and the new @xmath2 mass definition coincide at leading order in @xmath0 . at the same time",
    "we stress that the new definition accounts for recoil corrections of orders @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
    "but first we describe the physical picture and discuss the structure of the quark self energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the starting point of our considerations is an on - shell quark with mass @xmath36 and momentum @xmath37 ( i.e.  @xmath38 ) which we consider to be at rest , @xmath39 .",
    "this quark interacts with a number of gluons , the subdiagram @xmath40 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] describes the interaction between the gluons . in general the quark lines between the interaction points",
    "represent virtual quark states .",
    "however , if the virtual quark comes very close to the mass shell and the total momentum of the cloud of virtual gluons becomes soft , this situation gives rise to long - distance nonperturbative qcd interactions .",
    "the described ( virtual ) contributions result in the soft part of the self energy , @xmath34 . for a precise definition",
    "we start with a general self energy diagram as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath41 where the last factor is a non - commutative product with decreasing index @xmath42 .",
    "the line momenta @xmath43 are linear combinations of the gluon loop momenta @xmath44 , the particular representation is specified by the structure @xmath40 .",
    "the symbol @xmath45 means the set of all these loop momenta , the same symbol is used for the lorentz and color indices . in general",
    "we have @xmath46 which means that line momenta can be correlated .",
    "the momenta of the virtual quark states are given by @xmath47 .",
    "taking this as the starting point we define @xmath48 this equation is the definition of the soft part of the quark self energy .",
    "one can derive this expression from eq .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) by using the identity @xmath49 and the fact that the principal value integral does not give any infrared sensitive contribution .",
    "the delta function can be used to remove the integration over the zero component of @xmath50 . in order to parameterize the softness of the gluon cloud",
    "we impose a cutoff on the spatial component , @xmath51 , and indicate this by a label @xmath52 written at the upper limit of the three - dimensional integral .",
    "this cutoff @xmath52 is also known as _ factorization scale_. so we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ def2 ] ) as @xmath53 where @xmath54 the range of the index @xmath36 is reduced by one which indicates that one of the loop momenta is extracted as line momentum of the @xmath55-th line . in the following",
    "we deal with the different realizations of this compact expression .",
    "as we will see explicitly , the function @xmath56 occurring as integrand can be seen as quark - antiquark potential where we have summed over the spin of the tensor product of a final state with an initial state . because the static quark - antiquark potential is used in a similar way in ref .",
    "@xcite , we recover the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in the static limit . however , there is no kind of hierarchical order between both concepts because both solve the afore mentioned problems with non - perturbative uncertainties of the order @xmath57 .",
    "the role of non - perturbative effects of the order @xmath0 have to be studied elsewhere .",
    "the leading order contribution to the self energy of the quark is given by @xmath58 where feynman gauge is used for the gluon .",
    "the soft contribution thus reads @xmath59 the projector @xmath60 which represents the on - shell quark at rest can be placed at the left and at the right of the dirac structure and will lead to a further simplification . in terms of the zero component of the momentum @xmath27 the dirac delta function has two zeros @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the delta function is therefore written as @xmath65    the procedure which is done here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a  b ) .",
    "the cross indicates that we cut the line at this point by imposing the on - shell condition to the corresponding ( virtual ) momentum .",
    "the diagram then proceeds to a quark - antiquark interaction diagram where we have kept the crosses to indicate the position of the cut line .",
    "this line carries the momentum @xmath66 while the other two external lines carry the momentum @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly we obtain @xmath67 where @xmath68 for @xmath69 the restriction of the three - dimensional integral allows for an expansion in @xmath70 .",
    "we obtain @xmath71 and therefore @xmath72 the first term is the coulomb potential for a quark - antiquark interaction . the second term can be related to the breit - fermi potential of the quark - antiquark interaction  @xcite by summing over the spin states of the tensor product of the final quark and the final antiquark state and using the same kinematic constraints .",
    "moreover , one can identify @xmath73 with the scattering potential and @xmath74 with the annihilation potential .",
    "one can integrate this radial symmetric potential over the space components and end up with an expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "note that there are no contributions to odd powers of @xmath0 .",
    "but one can also integrate the exact expressions for @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ vpm ] ) up to the factorization scale @xmath52 and obtain @xmath76 the expansion of this expression in small values of @xmath77 results in @xmath78 the first term reproduces the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite to leading order in @xmath79 while the second term is the recoil correction to the static limit in this order of perturbation theory .",
    "this second term is related to the breit - fermi potential but does not coincide with it .",
    "to take a step beyond the leading order perturbation theory , we consider two - loop diagrams for the heavy quark self energy as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we calculate them in coulomb gauge , even though we stress that our final result is gauge invariant .",
    "the gluon propagator in coulomb gauge is given by @xmath80 the use of coulomb gauge splits up the gluon propagators into a coulomb term ( coulomb gluon ) and a transverse term ( transverse gluon ) where the first one couples to the quark via the time components only .",
    "this splitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b  d ) .",
    "we start our consideration with the abelian diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  ( b ) . in cutting the quark line in all possible ways",
    "we obtain a lot of diagrams . however , we find that the final contribution of these diagrams to the soft part of the self energy is suppressed by @xmath81 .",
    "there can be found different arguments for this suppression .",
    "first , in applying the classical ward identity , the qed diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] cancel exactly at @xmath82 , the remaining contribution is of order @xmath83 . concerning this note that the ward identity for the interaction vertex of a coulomb gluon with the quark holds even in non - abelian theories  @xcite .",
    "a second argument is that the interaction between a transverse gluon and a non - relativistic quark as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) is suppressed by @xmath77 , leading to an overall @xmath81 suppression .",
    "in addition , the box diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and  ( c ) are either suppressed by a factor @xmath81 or give an iteration of the leading order potential .",
    "to summarize , the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and  ( b ) give contributions only of the order @xmath84 .",
    "following these arguments , it turns out that the only abelian diagrams which can give a non - suppressed contribution to the soft part of the quark self energy are the diagrams containing the vacuum polarization of the gluon as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d  f ) .",
    "the simple calculation of these diagrams within the @xmath22 scheme , accounting only for light fermion loops , gluon loop ( and ghost loop if feynman gauge is used ) results after renormalization in @xmath85 this result has been anticipated because the expression in the curly brackets of the integrand reproduces the next - to - leading order correction to the qcd coulomb potential .      in this subsection",
    "we calculate the non - abelian diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) . in coulomb",
    "gauge this diagram gives rise to seven two - loop diagrams which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "direct calculations show that only the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) gives a contribution of order @xmath86 while the other diagrams are of order @xmath84 or vanish to this order in the coupling after applying the renormalization procedure ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "the calculation of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) is simple and we show it in detail .",
    "the contribution of this diagram to the self energy is given by @xmath87 here the lorentz structure of the three - gluon vertex is reduced to @xmath88 .",
    "the dirac structure of the integrand can be simplified to @xmath89 the rest of the diagram is symmetric with respect to the interchange of the two line momenta @xmath90 and @xmath91 . that provides us with a further simplification of the dirac structure , the self energy reduces to @xmath92 where @xmath93 has been used .",
    "we now employ the replacements @xmath94 i.e.  we set cuts at the two intermediate quark lines separately to obtain the two parts @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the soft contribution @xmath97 of the self energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "taking the first cut , the delta function removes the integration over @xmath98 . at the same time our definition of the soft contribution imposes a restriction @xmath99 on the space components of the first line momentum .",
    "the delta function @xmath100 with @xmath101 causes two contributions which are known as scattering and annihilation amplitude ( according to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , resp . ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath104 is done by using the residue theorem .",
    "actually there are only two denominator factors which can contribute to poles of the integrand , namely @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in summing up the four contributions from the integration over @xmath104 and @xmath98 we end up with a two - fold three - dimensional integral over the space components of the two line momenta where the first integral",
    "is restricted by @xmath99 as mentioned earlier .",
    "we now impose the restriction @xmath99 on the integrand to simplify it and obtain @xmath107 the integral over the space components of @xmath91 can be easily done by executing the angular integration followed by the radial integration .",
    "we obtain @xmath108 and therefore , finally @xmath109 symmetry considerations show that @xmath96 gives exactly the same contribution .",
    "as mentioned before , there are no other non - abelian contributions , therefore we obtain @xmath110 this result has been anticipated , too , to be minus one half of the non - abelian correction to the qcd coulomb potential , which is known in the literature ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath111 this calculation concludes the considerations of the two - loop diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .      summarizing all contribution up to nnlo accuracy",
    ", we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath36 is the pole mass , @xmath113 is the renormalization scale .",
    "this result is considered to be of the order @xmath114 because we imply that the ratio @xmath77 is typically of the order of @xmath79 or smaller .",
    "the scale @xmath52 is the factorization scale , and @xmath115 the constants @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 are given in appendix a. the coefficients @xmath120 and @xmath121 have been derived in ref .",

    "note that our result can be represented in a condensed form as @xmath125 where the first term @xmath25 is the static coulomb potential , @xmath126 is the relativistic correction ( which is related to breit - fermi potential but does not coincide with it ) , and @xmath127 is the non - abelian correction .",
    "in this section we consider the cross section of the process @xmath1 in the near threshold region where the velocity @xmath128 of the top quark is small .",
    "it is well - known that the conventional perturbative expansion does not work in the non - relativistic region because of the presence of the coulomb singularities at small velocities @xmath129 .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath130 appear due to the instantaneous coulomb interaction between the top and the antitop quark .",
    "the standard technique for resumming the terms @xmath130 consists in using the schrdinger equation for the coulomb potential and to find the green function  @xcite .",
    "the green function is then related to the cross section by the optical theorem . in order to determine nlo corrections to the cross section we need to know the short - distance correction to the vector current  @xcite , the nlo correction to the coulomb potential  @xcite , and the contribution of the non - factorizable corrections  @xcite .",
    "it was proven that the non - factorizable corrections cancel in the inclusive cross section at nlo and beyond  @xcite .    at nnlo",

    "these large shifts of the peak position were expected . as we discussed above ( and",
    "is well - known in the literature  @xcite ) , the pole mass definition suffers from the renormalon ambiguity .",
    "the top quark pole mass can not be defined better than @xmath57 .",
    "large nnlo corrections and a large shift of the @xmath17 resonance can spoil the top quark mass measurement at the nlc .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the calculation concept using the ps mass .",
    "we redefine the pole mass through the ps mass using the relation given in eq .",
    "( [ psmass ] ) without the @xmath0 contributions and then use the ps mass as an input parameter for our numerical analysis at lo , nlo , and nnlo . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show the top quark cross section expressed in terms of @xmath194 at lo , nlo , and nnlo ( like in fig .  [ fig9 ] ) as a function of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "we take @xmath195 which corresponds to the pole mass @xmath196 according to table  [ tab1 ] . in looking at fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we observe an improvement in the stability of the position of the first peak in comparison to the previous analysis as we go from lo to nlo to nnlo . actually , for the three values @xmath183 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 we obtain the maxima of the @xmath17 peak for nnlo at @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 while the maximal values are given by @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 , respectively .",
    "this demonstrated that a large variation in the renormalization scale @xmath113 gives rise only to a shift of about @xmath203 for the @xmath17 peak position at nnlo while the variation for @xmath204 is still large .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the calculation concept where we use the @xmath2 mass .",
    "we redefine the pole mass through the @xmath2 mass by using the relation given in eq .",
    "( [ psmass ] ) and then use the @xmath2 mass as an input parameter for the numerical analysis at lo , nlo , and nnlo . in fig .",

    "we take @xmath206 .",
    "again we observe a very good stability of the position of the first peak as we go from lo to nlo to nnlo , similar to the one observed for the ps mass case . studying the size of the nnlo corrections to the peak positions we conclude that the current theoretical uncertainty of the determination of the ps mass from the @xmath17 peak position is about @xmath3 .",
    "we introduced the so - called @xmath2 mass which is an infrared - insensitive quark mass , naturally defined by subtracting the soft part of the quark self energy from the pole mass .",
    "we demonstrated a deep relation of this definition with the static quark - antiquark potential . at leading order in @xmath0",
    "the @xmath2 mass coincides with the ps mass , defined in a completely different manner .",
    "in contrast to the pole mass , the @xmath2 mass is not sensitive to the non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "going beyond the static limit , the small normalization point introduces recoil corrections to the relation of the pole mass with the @xmath2 mass which have been calculated in this paper .",
    "in addition we demonstrated that , if we use the ps or the @xmath2 mass in the calculations , the perturbative predictions for the cross section become much more stable at higher orders of qcd ( shifts are below @xmath19 ) .",
    "this understanding removes one of the obstacles for an accurate top mass measurement and one can expect that the top quark mass will be extracted from a threshold scan at nlc with an accuracy of about @xmath3 . +",
