    "the recent results from the besiii  @xcite and belle collaboration  @xcite have attracted immediate attention from the hadron physics community .",
    "the observation of an enhancement @xmath1 with charge in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath8 in @xmath9 with high statistics may be a clear evidence for qcd  exotics \" in the charmonium energy region .",
    "the observation is also confirmed by the cleo - c experiment in @xmath10 in the invariant mass of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 is close to the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "it therefore is an interesting analogue to @xmath2 and @xmath13 , located close to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 thresholds , respectively , which were observed by the belle collaboration  @xcite last year .",
    "there have been a lot of theoretical efforts on the interpretation of the @xmath5 states  @xcite . almost immediately after besiii published their data , different interpretations  @xcite",
    "were proposed for understanding the nature of the @xmath1 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that , if there is a significant amount of @xmath16 in the wave function of @xmath17 , namely , if the @xmath17 is predominantly of molecular nature , then a large number of low energy @xmath18 @xmath12 pairs would be naturally produced , since both @xmath19 and @xmath12 can be nearly on - shell in a relative @xmath4-wave simultaneously .",
    "this leads to a significant enhancement of the pertinent loops and provides an ideal environment for the formation of @xmath12 bound or resonant systems .",
    "such a kinematic condition is similar to the so - called  triangle singularity \" discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the very same scenario also unavoidably leads to the appearance of a cusp , i.e. a pronounced structure in the close vicinity of the @xmath4-wave threshold .",
    "in contrast to a resonance , however , there is no nearby pole present in the amplitude . in ref .  @xcite it was argued that the location , strength and shape of the @xmath1 signal are inconsistent with its interpretation as a cusp .",
    "thus , an explicit resonance is needed in addition .",
    "still , if the @xmath1 qualifies as a @xmath20 resonance , the mechanism described should still lead to a significantly enhanced production rate , since it naturally provides a large number of low - energy @xmath20 pairs .",
    "the two - cut condition is operative in a limited kinematic range only . as a result ,",
    "the strength of the cusp as well as the number of low energy @xmath4-wave @xmath12 pairs available for the formation of the resonance , will strongly depend on the total energy of the system .",
    "we therefore predict that , if the @xmath1 is a resonance produced via non - perturbative @xmath12 interactions ( a @xmath21 resonance ) , its production rate should depend strongly on the total energy of the system . in other words , even in the absence of a pronounced cusp a hadron - hadron resonance can be produced , but in its presence the production of a hadron - hadron resonance should be largely enhanced . in this sense the total energy dependence of the @xmath1 production rate can be regarded as a diagnostic tool for understanding its composition , if the two cut - condition is really responsible for the copious production of @xmath1 in the decay of @xmath17 . on the contrary , if the @xmath1 is predominantly of tetra - quark nature , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dependence of the production rate on the total energy of the system should be much weaker .",
    "this prediction can be straightforwardly tested experimentally in @xmath22 annihilations .    in this work",
    ", we identify the relative @xmath4-wave heavy meson thresholds relevant for the decay of heavy vector mesons into a pion and the isovector system of interest and discuss the possible phenomenological implications of some of those in detail . in the end of the paper we will also discuss briefly @xmath23-wave thresholds .",
    "our analysis should provide a path towards a better understanding of the structure of some potential qcd exotics .",
    "in the vector sector , the relative @xmath4-wave open charm thresholds are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] .",
    "notice that the @xmath24 system provides the first relative @xmath4-wave open charm threshold .",
    "in addition , it is located near the mass position of @xmath17 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that if the @xmath17 is dominated by a molecular @xmath19 component , one can understand the appearance of the @xmath1 in @xmath25 quite naturally . in order to distinguish an explicit resonance from a cusp effect , besides looking at the particular shape and strength of the signal in the above mentioned reaction as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we here explore a broader kinematic region .",
    "we stress that molecular states and hadron - hadron resonances can not be formed by broad intermediate states  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a cusp effect will also become invisible with broad intermediate states  @xcite . taking this into account",
    ", there is only limited number of thresholds that can produce significant cusp effects for relative @xmath4-wave low - momentum @xmath21 or @xmath14 pairs , i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the charm sector , and @xmath31 and some other corresponding bottomed meson pairs in the bottom sector .",
    "-wave open charmed thresholds . ]     with hidden charm decays into @xmath32 via the singularity mechanism .",
    "the feynman diagrams in the bottomonium sector are analogous . ]",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath33 ( right panel ) without considering the widths of the intermediate mesons .",
    "the charge conjugate transitions , which behave in a similar manner , are not included here .",
    "the numbers in the figures are the absolute values of three point scalar functions and the numbers in the sidebar are their relative strengths . ]    in order to demonstrate the dynamic features of the relative @xmath4-wave couplings and low - momentum @xmath12 scatterings , we employ the following lagrangians in the calculation @xmath34 for the @xmath17 coupling to other @xmath35 mesons , and @xmath36+h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath37 coupling to @xmath35 and a pion . here the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) field contains the annihilation operators for the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) quark configuration .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath37 fields are constructed analogously . to account for the heavy quark spin symmetry , @xmath38 and @xmath42",
    "are collected into a single multiplet which makes them share the same coupling constants @xmath43 and @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "the details for the other interactions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the cusp kinematic region where the intermediated states are ( nearly ) on shell , the exchanged charmed meson between the @xmath45 and a pion is far off - shell .",
    "within such a kinematic region the propagator for the exchanged charmed meson is approximately @xmath46 and the @xmath47 amplitude can be treated as a local function @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the invariant mass of @xmath11 and @xmath50-channel momentum transfer , respectively . since @xmath48 does not vary drastically within the range of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the four - point loop function in fig .",
    "[ fig - feynman - diagram ] can be expressed as the following typical expression and be analyzed as a three - point function : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the three momentum of the pion connected to the initial vector charmonium through the @xmath37 , @xmath53 is the product of all the coupling constants from different vertices and @xmath54 is the scalar three point loop function . since our focus is on the dependencies of the loops on the external parameters in order to identify the singularity regions , we set @xmath55 and only use the three - point scalar function @xmath54 .",
    "this allows us to also investigate the effect of the width of the intermediate mesons . in any physical transition , pre - factors , which depend on the three - momentum @xmath52 , can distort the spectra to some extend , however , the general features of the amplitudes persist .      for the final state @xmath32 ,",
    "the kinematics in favor of the two - cut condition in the intermediate meson loops depends simultaneously on both the initial mass ( @xmath57 ) as well as the invariant mass of @xmath58 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "a @xmath20 cusp effect will be produced by diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig - feynman - diagram ] . to illustrate this",
    "we show in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] the modulus of results for these diagrams in the @xmath57-@xmath49-plane . for simplicity in subsections  [ sect - dd1]-[sect - bb ]",
    "all intermediate mesons are treated as stable .",
    "the effect of their widths will be discussed later in subsection  [ sect - width ] .",
    "a singularity region can be identified where the transition amplitude is strongly enhanced and a pronounced cusp is expected around the @xmath12 threshold region for @xmath59 gev .",
    "unfortunately , in the preferred kinematic range there is no vector resonance , as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] .",
    "still , an energy scan of the @xmath22 system in this energy range would be very valuable .",
    "interestingly , it should be noticed that there is still a visible enhancement even for @xmath60 gev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dd](a ) , due to the strong curvature of the contour lines .",
    "it is this enhancement that was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig - feynman - diagram ] , the pion is radiated by the narrow @xmath61 which is assigned to be the mixed partner of the broad @xmath62 between the @xmath63 and @xmath64 states  @xcite . the spin symmetry demands that the @xmath63 state decays into @xmath65 via a @xmath38-wave while the @xmath64 decays via an @xmath4-wave .",
    "thus , it is the former that is to be identified with @xmath61 , although some heavy quark symmetry breaking effects are expected and may result in mixings between these two configurations  @xcite .",
    "given that the narrow @xmath61 is to be dominated by the @xmath63 configuration , it will introduce a different momentum and angular dependence for the produced pion in comparison with the so - called  initial state pion emission ( ispe ) \" proposed in refs .",
    "another distinct feature of the mechanism discussed here compared to the ispe is its non - local character . a detailed measurement of the evolution of the @xmath66 invariant mass spectra in terms of the initial @xmath22 c.m .",
    "energies could shed some light on the pion emission mechanism in the future .",
    "however , a proper theoretical treatment needs the inclusion of the @xmath66 final state interactions , which goes beyond the scope of this paper and will be studied in a separated work .",
    "invariant mass distribution at the center energy @xmath67 in the @xmath68 channel _ with _",
    "( dashed ) and _ without _ ( solid ) the width effects for the intermediate particles .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines denote the @xmath12 and @xmath69 thresholds , respectively , from left to right . ]      in the energy region where the @xmath70 intermediate state of diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig - feynman - diagram ] can be nearly on - shell , the two - cut condition is no longer satisfied for the @xmath56 intermediate state , which means that the @xmath21 cusp effect can not be produced significantly in this energy region .",
    "however , in this kinematic region the @xmath69 cusp can be produced .",
    "as shown by the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] , a strong enhancement can be expected in the invariant mass of @xmath11 around the @xmath69 threshold for @xmath71 gev .",
    "this region also extends ( though somewhat less pronounced ) even down to values of @xmath57 as low as 4.38 gev .    from fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] it becomes apparent that a simultaneous appearance of cusps at both the @xmath12 and @xmath69 thresholds is not kinematically favored .",
    "this provides an explanation why there was no structure near the @xmath69 threshold observed simultaneously with the discovery of the @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , not only the strength but also the lineshape of the cusps change rather significantly when the initial energy changes .",
    "such a behavior is very different from that of a resonance or a bound state , since their pole position is independent of the initial energy .",
    "we therefore expect that the dependence of the shape of a near - threshold structure on the initial energy contains direct information on the relative importance of the cusp and the resonance pole for a particular signal .    with the ( red ) solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig - jpsipi ] , we show the invariant mass distribution of @xmath11 at @xmath72 gev due to the processes listed in fig .  [ fig - feynman - diagram ]  still with all particles assumed stable .",
    "this is the energy region where the two - cut condition is satisfied for @xmath69 and a very pronounced cusp occurs at this threshold .",
    "meanwhile , since for the @xmath21 threshold the two - cut condition is not satisfied for this initial energy , the corresponding cusp disappears , although it is accessible kinematically .      the above analysis can also be applied to the bottom sector .",
    "we present the plots showing the correlations between the initial mass and the invariant mass of @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig - bb ] , where the cusps caused by the @xmath14 ( left panel ) or @xmath15 ( right panel ) threshold can be easily identified .",
    "the singularity regions are very similar to those in the charm sector except that now there is a common kinematic region that allows those two cusps from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 thresholds to appear simultaneously .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath76 is much smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "( left panel ) and @xmath15 ( right panel ) without considering the widths of the intermediate mesons .",
    "the numbers have the same meanings as those in fig .",

    "[ fig - upsilonpi ] , we present the invariant mass distributions of the transitions @xmath80 ( diagram ( a ) ) and @xmath79 ( diagram ( b ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the production of @xmath81 does not satisfy the two - cut condition for the process @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , there are no obvious enhancements at the @xmath14 and @xmath15 thresholds . in contrast",
    ", the @xmath7 lies exactly in the singularity region which makes the two cusp peaks corresponding to the @xmath14 and @xmath82 quite significant .",
    "this result turns out to be important for understanding the nature of @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite . from the scenario studied in this work",
    "the structures called @xmath5 and @xmath6 observed in @xmath83 can not be cusps but should result from explicit resonance poles , contrary to other claims in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , for the decay of @xmath7 there should be simultaneously a large number of both @xmath14 as well as @xmath82 pairs available . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are hadron - hadron resonances and their existences are due to the non - perturbative @xmath74 interactions , their production should be favored in the decay of @xmath7 . for this scenario",
    "we therefore predict much stronger signals for these states in @xmath7 than in @xmath84 decays .",
    "results for the singularity regions for the loops with the widths of the intermediate particles considered are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - dd2 ] . taking the singularity region in the charm sector as an example",
    ", we show the results after considering the width of the @xmath61 with @xmath85  @xcite and @xmath86  @xcite . in comparison with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] , we see that the cusp effects are smeared significantly for both the @xmath12 and @xmath69 threshold .",
    "this becomes also clear from the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - jpsipi ] , where the @xmath87 invariant mass distribution is shown for @xmath88 gev .    as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig - dd2 ] , above 4.32 gev the structure at @xmath12 threshold is much more like a shoulder ( see also dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig - jpsipi ] ) .",
    "this should be different from the enhancement caused by a pole structure .     and @xmath42 .",
    "diagram ( a ) is for the @xmath12 singularity region and ( b ) is for @xmath89 .",
    "the numbers have the same meanings as those in fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] . ]",
    "recently the @xmath1 signal is also reported in the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution in the process @xmath90 at @xmath91 by an analysis using the cleo - c data  @xcite .",
    "although it is well below the first @xmath4-wave threshold ( c.f .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] ) , there is a well established quarkonium , @xmath92 , nearby and its dominant decay mode is @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "thus , a meson loop analogous to the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig - feynman - diagram ] contains a @xmath23-wave vertex via the @xmath94 interaction . due to the centrifugal barrier cusps",
    "do not occur for partial waves higher than @xmath4-waves .",
    "although for higher partial waves there still is a non - analyticity , it becomes visible in the derivative of amplitudes only  @xcite .",
    "however , the second part of the loop still produces a cusp , as can be seen in fig .  [ fig-4160 ] .",
    "although the singularity region is now more limited in phase space , it still gives rise to some mild enhancement at 4.17 gev .",
    "it implies that in order to explain the resonance signal observed by cleo - c , an explicit resonance may be necessary , which turns out to be consistent with our findings in the higher energy region .",
    "meanwhile , we anticipate that for @xmath95 even though it can give access to the @xmath12 cusp via its strong coupling to the @xmath12 channel  @xcite , the phase space would be extremely small and it remains to be seen if the @xmath1 is observable at that low energies .     via the @xmath93 intermediate loops .",
    "the numbers have the same meanings as those in fig .",
    "[ fig - dd ] . ]",
    "the above analysis has identified the kinematic regions in the heavy vector meson sectors where the relative @xmath4-wave heavy meson open thresholds may play an important role when a nearby vector state decays into a lighter quarkonium state plus two pions .",
    "it shows that there exist mass regions that can fulfill the two - cut condition such that the intermediate heavy meson loop can produce significant cusp effects .",
    "the clarification of the origin of the cusps and their evolutions with the initial masses would be important for a better understanding of these near - threshold enhancements recently observed in experiment , i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath96 etc . based on our analysis , we argue , that these states should not be purely due to cusp effects if they can be observed out of the kinematics of the singularity regions identified in this work .",
    "we further argue that the dependence of these states on the initial energy for the production should reveal more information on whether they can be viewed as ( predominantly ) hadronic molecules or hadron - hadron resonances , or whether they should be viewed as more complicated structures .",
