    "the ideas of @xmath0 symmetry , originally introduced in the context of quantum mechanics@xcite-@xcite , have recently led to rapid developments in the apparently unconnected field of classical optics@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the connection arises from the fact that when one makes the paraxial approximation for the equation of propagation of an electromagnetic wave the resulting equation is formally identical to the schrdinger equation , but with different interpretations for the symbols appearing therein .",
    "in particular , the role of time in the schrdinger equation is taken by the longitudinal coordinate @xmath2 , while that of the quantum - mechanical potential is taken by variations of the refractive index of the medium in the transverse @xmath3 direction .",
    "@xmath0-symmetry deals with potentials that are not hermitian , which translates in optics to complex refractive indices .",
    "it is extremely common for the refractive index to have a positive imaginary part , corresponding to loss , but a negative imaginary part can also be implemented by optical pumping , leading to gain .",
    "@xmath0-symmetry requires that loss and gain be balanced in a particular way , namely that @xmath4 , or equivalently that @xmath5 be an even function and @xmath6 an odd function of @xmath3 .",
    "when the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken this leads to real propagation constants , i.e. no exponential growth or decay even in the presence of gain and loss .",
    "although this connection was first made explicit in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exotic properties of materials with combined gain and loss were previously explored in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in those papers the index modulation was in the @xmath2 direction rather than the transverse @xmath3 direction . in that case",
    "the equation of propagation for a given component of the electric field is just the scalar helmholtz equation [ helmholtz ] e(z)=0 , which can be compared to the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "this situation was highlighted in the paper by lin et al.@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the particular case when the variation in @xmath7 is a pure complex exponential proportional to @xmath1 the metamaterial exhibits to a very good approximation the phenomenon of  unidirectional invisibility \" for normal incidence , with perfect transmission and zero reflection from the left . on the other hand , for right incidence ,",
    "the concomitant property is a greatly enhanced reflectivity , sharply peaked at @xmath8 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite an analytic solution was found for the scattering coefficients in terms of bessel functions , showing the limitations of the coupled - mode approximation used in ref .",
    "it was shown that for the parameters used in that paper there were small deviations from invisibility , and that the property broke down completely for much longer lengths of the grating .",
    "these papers were concerned with the one - dimensional situation described by eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) , that is , for normal incidence on the lattice ( as shown in figs .  1 and 2 below ) .",
    "however , it is of interest to generalize this situation in two ways .",
    "first one can consider incidence at an angle , and secondly the situation when the grating is superimposed on a material of different refractive index than those on either side .",
    "this problem has recently been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in the context of the bragg approximation method , with analytic expressions obtained for the first three bragg orders . in the present paper we demonstrate that the method of ref .",
    "@xcite can be extended to deal with both these generalizations , yielding analytic expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of modified bessel functions .",
    "our results can be used to check the approximations used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but are applicable for a much wider range of parameters .    in the following sec .",
    "[ recap ] we briefly review the methodology and results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ new ] we generalize the analysis to include non - normal incidence and different refractive indices on either side of the grating .",
    "these results are then used in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] to produce graphs of transmission and reflection coefficients , as a function of angle , in a variety of different configurations . in sec .",
    "[ mirror ] we revert to the one - dimensional situation and consider placing a mirror at one end of the grating , showing that , because of the enhanced reflectivity of the grating , the cavity can lase when its strength exceeds a certain critical value . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we give our conclusions .",
    "the set - up dealt with in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite is shown in fig .  1 ( for left incidence ) .",
    "we recall here the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for completeness and comparison with the results in the more general case .",
    "the situation is essentially one - dimensional , and eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) reduces to + k^2(1 + 2v(z))e=0 , where @xmath9 has the special form @xmath10 .",
    "changing variables to @xmath11 , the equation becomes y^2+y-(y^2+k^2/^2)e=0 , which is the modified bessel equation , with solution @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . in the language of quantum mechanics ( @xmath14 ) , ( z)=ci_(y)+dk_(y )",
    "this has to be matched on to @xmath15 at @xmath16 .      by requiring",
    "that @xmath17 and @xmath18 we find that c&=&y_+k_+1(y_+)e^ikl/2d&=&y_+i_+1(y_+)e^ikl/2 , where @xmath19 , so that ( z)=y_+e^ikl/2 both initial conditions are satisfied by virtue of the various recursion relations among the modified bessel functions and the wronskian identity@xcite [ wronskian ] k_+1(y)i_(y)+i_+1(y)k_(y)=1/y  .",
    "at @xmath20 we have to match @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the general formulas are a_l e^ikz&= & & & b_l e^-ikz&= & which give , after some algebra , [ lt ] a_l&= & ( ^2 ) e^ikl[k_+1(y_+)i_-1(y_-)-i_+1(y_+)k_-1(y_- ) ] + & & + b_l&= & ( ^2 ) e^-ikl[-k_+1(y_+)i_+1(y_-)+i_+1(y_+)k_+1(y_- ) ]      the set - up is shown in fig .  2 , with the transmitted amplitude again normalized to 1 .",
    "the initial conditions are now @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which give c&=&y_-k_-1(y_-)e^ikl/2d&=&y_-i_-1(y_-)e^ikl/2 , so that ( z)=y_-e^ikl/2 again , the initial conditions are satisfied by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ wronskian ] ) .",
    "at @xmath25 we have to match @xmath21 with @xmath26 .",
    "the general formulas are a_r e^-ikz&= & & & b_r e^ikz&= & giving [ rt ] a_r&= & ( ^2 ) e^ikl[i_-1(y_-)k_+1(y_+)-k_-1(y_-)i_+1(y_+ ) ] + & & + b_r&= & ( ^2 ) e^-ikl[-i_-1(y_-)k_-1(y_+)+k_-1(y_-)i_-1(y_+)]note that the reflection amplitude @xmath27 can be obtained from @xmath28 by the transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which is a consequence of @xmath0 symmetry . under those same transformations",
    "the transmission amplitude @xmath31 is invariant .",
    "the equality of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a general result , obtained most easily by evaluating the wronskian of the two solutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "a caution about the implementation of eqs .  ( [ lt ] ) and ( [ rt ] ) is in order . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the argument @xmath38 of the bessel functions encircles the origin and crosses the cut on the negative real axis many times as @xmath2 goes from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "thus it is important to know how to continue onto subsequent sheets .",
    "once the relevant formulas given in ref .",
    "@xcite are implemented the resulting functions are smooth functions of @xmath2 , with no discontinuities .",
    "in this section we generalize the previous results in two ways , by considering non - normal incidence allowing for different background refractive indices on either side of the grating .      the set - up for left incidence",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    for incidence at an angle , there is an overall component of the wave , in , say , the @xmath3-direction , of the form @xmath41 . so in eq .",
    "( [ helmholtz ] ) we can write @xmath42 as @xmath43 , and the equation for @xmath44 becomes + = 0 . here",
    "@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the free - space wave - vector .",
    "the appropriate definition of @xmath38 is now @xmath47 , which again results in the modified bessel equation y^2+y-(y^2+^2)=0 , with the difference that @xmath48 is now defined by ^2= or in other words @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the internal angle of refraction .",
    "thus @xmath38 can be written as y=()e^iz . when considering non - normal incidence the boundary conditions depend on the polarization state of the input radiation . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the simplest case of @xmath51-mode polarization , in which the @xmath52-field is in the @xmath38-direction , and so parallel to the two interfaces at @xmath16 .",
    "in general the boundary conditions require that the tangential electric and magnetic fields be continuous across a boundary . in this case",
    "@xmath53 is proportional to @xmath54 , so the conditions are that @xmath21 and @xmath54 be continuous , as before .",
    "the difference is that , for @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 the longitudinal wave - vectors in the three regions are unequal .",
    "thus , given that @xmath57 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . in the previous case of equal background permittivities these reduced to @xmath61 .",
    "applying the boundary conditions of continuity for both @xmath21 and @xmath54 we obtain , after some algebra , the following expressions for @xmath32 and @xmath28 : [ exactl ] a_l e^-ikl&= & ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_+1(y_+)-i_+1(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_+1(y_+)+i_+1(y_+)k_(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_- ) ] & & + b_l e^ikl&= & -()[i_+1(y_-)k_+1(y_+)-i_+1(y_+)k_+1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_+1(y_+)+i_+1(y_+)k_(y_-)]&&- ( ) [ i_+1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_+1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_-)]where @xmath62 .",
    "each expression now has potentially three additional terms due to the fact that in the general case @xmath63 .",
    "the set - up for right incidence is shown in fig .",
    "the algebra follows on similar lines and results in the following expression for @xmath33 , @xmath27 : [ exactr ] a_r e^ikl&= & ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_+1(y_+)-i_+1(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_+1(y_+)+i_+1(y_+)k_(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_- ) ] & & + b_r e^ikl&= & ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_+1(y_+)-i_+1(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_+1(y_+)+i_+1(y_+)k_(y_-)]&&- ( ) [ i_-1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_-)]note that , with different background permittivities @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath32 is now @xmath66 .",
    "this relation can again be obtained by considering the wronskian of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "in this section we explore a variety of different configurations .",
    "it should be stressed again that these are configurations which have previously been considered within the bragg approximation scheme in ref .",
    "the results can be directly compared , is opposite to the one used here , namely @xmath67 , so that left and right are effectively interchanged . ] , and are broadly similar but differ in some details .",
    "this is to expected , given the relatively small strength ( @xmath68 ) of the grating .",
    "for larger grating strengths only the present method can be expected to give reliable results , unless several more orders in the bragg series can be included .      as the first application of the equations we have derived",
    ", we consider oblique incidence on the grating , but keeping the background relative permittivities the same , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .  5 ( left panel ) we show the transmission coefficient , which , as already remarked , is the same for left or right incidence .",
    "the same characteristic shape that was seen in ref .",
    "@xcite is seen again here , but this time as a function of @xmath50 rather than @xmath69 .",
    "the transition occurs near @xmath70 , the angle for which @xmath71 . in the right panel",
    "we show the left reflection coefficient @xmath72 , which is small , although it increases with larger @xmath73 , and shows no transition near @xmath74 .",
    "thus invisibility from the left is preserved to a large extent , with a small reflection coefficient and a transmission coefficient very close to 1 .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the right reflection coefficient @xmath75 for the same set of parameters .",
    "as a function of @xmath50 the right reflection coefficient displays the same high narrow peak that occurs for normal incidence when @xmath69 is varied .",
    "it should be mentioned that these reflection and transmission coefficients satisfy the modified unitarity relation @xmath76 of ref .",
    "@xcite to a high degree of accuracy , which provides a stringent test of our formulas .",
    "note that @xmath77 for @xmath78 .      a rather natural set - up",
    "would be for the optical lattice / grating to be implemented on a slab of material with background permittivity @xmath79 different from the permittivities on either side .",
    "as an example , in this subsection we consider a slab in air , with @xmath80 .",
    "it is only to be expected that the reflection and transmission properties will be significantly modified in this case , due to reflections at the interfaces between the different materials .",
    "this is indeed borne out by fig .  7 , for the transmission coefficient and the left reflection coefficient .    however , a more relevant quantity as far as unidirectional invisibility is concerned is the contrast , i.e. the differences @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the transmission coefficients in the absence of the grating , i.e. with @xmath85 .",
    "these quantities are shown in fig .",
    "8 , which reveals that @xmath86 is rather small for @xmath87 , but becomes appreciable for larger values , and indeed becomes of @xmath88 in the vicinity of @xmath89 .",
    "the contrast @xmath90 is quite small overall , particularly for @xmath87 , but shows a significant peak in the vicinity of @xmath89 .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the right reflection coefficient , which still shows a characteristic peak near @xmath89 , but other structure arising from reflection from the boundaries besides .",
    "another natural situation in practice could be for the grating to be implemented on a substrate with a different background permittivity .",
    "so , for example , we could have @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in which case the reflective side of the grating would be attached to the substrate .",
    "we could also have the non - reflective side of the grating attached to the substrate , a situation that was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , but which we will not discuss here . in this asymmetric case ,",
    "when @xmath94 , the set - up is no longer @xmath0 symmetric , so that the test of generalized unitarity can not be applied , and also the relation @xmath95 no longer holds , as has been previously remarked .",
    "one therefore defines the diffraction efficiency for transmission from the left as @xmath96 and similarly @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 .    again the reflection and transmission properties are modified , although rather less than in case b. in fig .",
    "10 we show the diffaction efficiency for transmission and the left reflection coefficient .",
    "the corresponding contrasts @xmath99 and @xmath82 are shown in fig .",
    "11 , from which it can be seen that @xmath100 , and is considerably smaller in the region @xmath87 .",
    "the contrast @xmath90 is an order of magnitude smaller .    in fig .",
    "12 we show the right reflection coefficient , which now has a fairly clean peak near @xmath89 , with some additional structure for larger @xmath73 .",
    "in this case we revert to normal incidence from the left and take @xmath101 .",
    "then both @xmath32 and @xmath28 tend to infinity because of the terms containing the factor @xmath102 .",
    "we can take out this factor and define @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which in this limit are given by _",
    "l e^ikl&=&()[i_-1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_-1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_- ) ] and _",
    "l e^ikl&= & - ( ) [ i_+1(y_-)k_(y_+)+i_(y_+)k_+1(y_-)]&&+ ( ) [ i_(y_-)k_(y_+)-i_(y_+)k_(y_- ) ]    because of the enhanced reflectivity of the grating for right incidence narrowly peaked around @xmath105 , it seems likely that we will have a resonant cavity near the corresponding frequency , which might well support lasing .",
    "for lasing we are looking for a reflection coefficient @xmath106 going to infinity , so we are looking for a zero of @xmath107 , or equivalently of @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "13 we show @xmath72 as a function of @xmath69 ( @xmath108 ) for the value of @xmath109 we have been using throughout the paper .",
    "as we can see , this exhibits an extremely sharp peak at a certain value of @xmath69 , indicating that for that value of @xmath69 we are very near a zero of @xmath107 . by fine - tuning @xmath109",
    "we can find a zero of @xmath107 for real @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , the complex zero in @xmath69 migrates from the lower half - plane to the upper half - plane as @xmath109 increases , crossing the real axis at the critical value , the lasing threshold . we will be exploring this lasing set - up in more detail in future work .",
    "we have shown how the exact analytic solutions previously obtained for the one - dimensional grating with index profile proportional to @xmath1 can be generalized to the case of different refractive indices on either side of the grating as well as to non - normal incidence .",
    "the resulting formulas for the reflection and transmission amplitudes , eqs .",
    "( [ exactl ] ) and ( [ exactr ] ) , contain three additional terms , of the same general form as in the restricted case , but with different indices on the modified bessel functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "these formulas were used to explore the transmission and reflection characteristics of the grating as a function of incident angle in a variety of situations previously considered within the bragg approximation scheme , with particular emphasis on the extent to which unidirectional invisibility survives .",
    "the narrow - beam enhanced reflection of the grating for right incidence leads one to suppose that when a mirror is placed to the right of the cavity , the arrangement might support lasing , which calculation using our generalized formulas shows to be indeed the case .      c.  m.  bender and s.  boettcher , phys .",
