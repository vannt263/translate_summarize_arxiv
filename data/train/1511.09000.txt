    "the recent discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe , obtained studying the redshift of supernovae @xcite and the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , can be understood introducing a cosmological constant @xmath0 in the standard friedman model .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 model is so used to describe the evolution of the universe with three fundamental ingredients : dark energy due to the cosmological constant ( 69.2% ) , cold dark matter and baryonic matter ( 30.8% ) . in the standard @xmath1 model ,",
    "the cosmological constant does not depend on time , but the model must admit a period of inflation at the very beginning that can not be explained with a very small and constant @xmath2 . immediately after the big bang , scalar fields or dilaton fields or `` ad hoc '' large values of @xmath0 were introduced to obtain the inflation era .",
    "our aim is to see what we can learn about the cosmological constant studying its local behavior . to this aim ,",
    "we assume that the cosmological constant depends on time , as several authors have already done before us ( see for example : @xcite ) , and that its value today is @xmath3 ( as estimated by planck satellite data of the cosmic background radiation @xcite ) , even if it may have been different in a far past . anyway ,",
    "if the value of the cosmological constant is small , the effects caused by its existence on the local geometry can be treated in the weak field approximation @xcite .",
    "using the notations of landau and lifsits @xcite , we start from the einstein field equations in the form @xmath4and from a metric @xmath5where @xmath6 is the flat minkowski metric and we obtain the linearized einstein field equations neglecting terms @xmath7 @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10the equation ( 3 ) was obtained imposing the gauge condition @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12we focus our attention on a finite region of space of volume @xmath13 and we assume a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor in the form @xmath14u_{\\mu } u_{\\nu } , \\]]where there are a central source of radius @xmath15 with such an energy density @xmath16 that @xmath17 for @xmath18 and also an amount of energy density @xmath19 spread all over @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore @xmath20 in the weak field approximation .",
    "hence , being @xmath21 , the einstein equation ( 3 ) , in the region @xmath13 outside the source @xmath22 ( that is for @xmath18 ) , for the @xmath23 component can be written : @xmath24we choose @xmath25where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unknown functions of time .",
    "since @xmath29from ( 8) we calculate @xmath30and @xmath31note that from the constraint @xmath32 we can add the equation @xmath33where a dot means derivative with respect to @xmath34 , and we have @xmath35where the constant @xmath36 is such that @xmath37 . then putting @xmath38 and substituting ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) in the equation ( 7 ) , we obtain @xmath39finally we can find the unknown @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath40 functions from the conditions : @xmath41solving the differential equation , i.e. , @xmath42 , \\]]we have derived the behavior of the cosmological constant as a function of time in terms of the weierstrass @xmath43 function and two integration constants : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "a plot of the function @xmath46 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "more difficult is to find @xmath28 from the remaining equation : @xmath47that can be solved by a numerical integration .",
    "a particular solution of this differential equation , in the simple case of @xmath48 ( when @xmath49 ) , is @xmath50and , considering that in our model @xmath51 , with a suitable choice of the constant @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 in a large range of time and the linear approximation works .",
    "function in the case of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we highlight the periodic behavior of such function . ]",
    "fixing the constants as @xmath54 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we highlight how , for these values of @xmath44 , @xmath59 and @xmath36 , the function at today time ( @xmath60 billions of years , i.e. , @xmath61 ) acquires the expected value of @xmath62 .",
    "this value is in proximity of the minimum of the function . ]",
    "obtained in the limit case @xmath63 , fixing the constants as @xmath54 , @xmath64 .",
    "we highlight how , for these values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , the cosmological constant at today time ( @xmath60 billions of years , i.e. @xmath61 ) acquires the expected value of @xmath65 .",
    "this value is in proximity of the minimum of the function . ]",
    "we obtained a first result determining the @xmath66 component of the metric tensor ( 8) that is : @xmath67where the fourth term induces locally a repulsive effect , the same that globally produces the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "if we compare this term with the corresponding term in the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime @xcite we interpret the coefficient before @xmath68 as an effective cosmological constant @xmath69 .",
    "but the plot ( figure 1 ) of weierstrass elliptic @xmath70 - function is even more interesting .",
    "it shows a periodic function that is almost constant between two asymptotes .",
    "if the first asymptote is in @xmath71 ( it occurs fixing @xmath72 ) , the rapid decrease of the cosmological constant seems to denote the post inflation phase of the universe from which , a long era of almost constant value of @xmath73 starts .",
    "the amplitude of this era is ruled by the constant @xmath74 that can be tuned to obtain a lapse of time at least equal to the age of the universe .",
    "finally , the constant @xmath36 can be chosen in such a way that the minimum of @xmath75 approximatively corresponds to the today value of the cosmological constant . this way , fixing in a suitable manner the arbitrary constants @xmath36 , @xmath76 and @xmath74 , it is always possible to make the model in agreement with the experimental cosmological constraints : an example is shown in figure 2 .",
    "but it is surprising that the model works also in the case of vanishing @xmath36 and @xmath77 .",
    "we show in figure 3 the plot of the cosmological constant obtained fixing only @xmath76 and @xmath74 and the cosmological constraints are satisfied as well .",
    "this case is mathematically more appealing because the number of free adjustable parameters is smaller , but it must admit the existence of negative energy density @xmath78 that , anyway , is often invoked in several physical theories , such as casimir effect , traversable wormholes , warp drives , black hole evaporation , or as a property of some kind of exotic matter .    independently on the choice of the constants , the @xmath0 function has always the two asymptotes ( except the trivial case @xmath48 with only one asymptote for @xmath79 ) whose meaning is an inflationary behavior of the cosmological constant . of course",
    ", going back into the past , when the cosmological constant becomes larger and larger , there will be an instant when the linear approximation can be no longer applied .",
    "anyway we consider an important result to have obtained , with a so simple model and without introducing any other auxiliary fields besides @xmath75 , the prediction of a past and also of a future inflationary era ."
