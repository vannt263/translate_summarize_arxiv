    "much effort has been made to improve the properties of permanent magnets , whose figure of merit is the maximum energy product @xmath2 that increases with coercivity and remanent magnetization .",
    "exchange spring magnets @xcite , nanocomposite materials consisting of hard and soft magnetic phases coupled by exchange interaction , have been promising as high - performance magnets @xcite , and nd  fe  b - based exchange spring magnets are particularly attractive from the viewpoint of low rare - earth metal content . in theoretical studies ,",
    "@xmath2 values of 0.6@xmath31.0 mjm@xmath4 for nd  fe  b - based magnets have been predicted @xcite , but such high energy - product values have been difficult to achieve in real materials @xcite . to obtain greater values of @xmath2 in real materials , the advanced design of nanostructures is required .",
    "although the optimal grain size and multilayer thickness of exchange spring magnets have been intensively studied @xcite , little is known about other crucial factors affecting the magnetic properties of exchange spring magnets .    based on a first - principles study , toga et al . pointed out that the magnetic properties of nd@xmath0fe@xmath1b ( nfb)/bcc - fe multilayer systems strongly depend on the crystallographic alignments of nfb and fe layers @xcite . it was shown that the nfb layer of the ( 001 ) plane is ferromagnetically coupled with fe layers , but the ( 100 ) plane is anti - ferromagnetically coupled .",
    "recently , these predictions were confirmed by ogawa et al .",
    "@xcite by performing ferromagnetic resonance measurements .",
    "their results imply that random crystallographic alignments possibly deteriorate magnetic performances because of low remanent magnetization . however , the reason for the drastically different results depending on crystallographic alignments is not known at present .",
    "moreover , it has been recognized that structure optimizations performed in a previous study @xcite are not sufficient , because those structures are only optimized with respect to the interlayer distance between the nfb and fe layers , but not with respect to cell volume , cell shape , and ion sites . in order to identify and present reliable guidelines for fabricating high - performance magnets ,",
    "the adequate optimization of nanostructures is desirable .    in the present work",
    ", we theoretically study the interface magnetic structure in exchange spring magnets .",
    "our aim is to optimize the structure of the nfb / transition metal [ tm = ( bcc-)fe , ( hcp-)co ] multilayer systems for a variety of crystallographic alignments of nfb layers , and to analyze those interface electronic structures in order to understand crucial factors that determine the properties of high - performance magnets . in particular , we focus on nfb(100)/tm , which shows significantly different properties between tm = fe and tm = co systems .    in our calculations ,",
    "we assume a collinear spin structure between local moments at nfb layer and tm layer .",
    "actually , there may be a possibility of non - collinear structure , but credible results for non - collinear structures are hard to obtain in such a case of finite sized super - cell model with periodic boundary condition .",
    "therefore , a detailed spin structure is not predicted from our model , but the results suggest a necessity to reconsider the tacit postulation that the interface coupling in exchange spring magnets is always ferromagnetic .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our model and explain the method of structure optimization . in section iii , the results of our calculation are presented and discussed . finally , the summary and conclusions of our work are described in section iv .",
    "we study the electronic structure of nfb / tm multilayer systems , as shown in fig .",

    "the lattice constants of nfb are set to @xmath5  and @xmath6  , and ion sites are determined as per a previous study @xcite .",
    "the bcc - fe and hcp - co are assumed as structurally soft phases , and these plane indices facing the interface are chosen so as to match the surface size of an nfb unit cell .",
    "it is experimentally confirmed that the ( 001 ) plane and ( 100 ) plane of nfb layers match the ( 100 ) plane and ( 110 ) plane of bcc - fe layers , respectively , but the other systems studied in this paper have not been well investigated experimentally .",
    "the deformed lattice constants of these soft phases are shown in table [ table : parameter ] ( the definitions of parameters are shown in fig .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the comparison between the results of the tm = fe system and those of the tm = co system show that the optimized interlayer distance of the former models are shorter than those of the latter due to the strength difference of the nuclear interactions .",
    "the absolute value of coupling energy for tm = fe is smaller than that for tm = co , which may reflect the situation that the magnetic stiffness of fe is lower than that of co whose @xmath12-electron number is optimum for ferromagnetism .",
    "it is confirmed from table [ table : opt ] that the magnetization of nfb(001)/fe(100 ) , nfb(110)/fe(112 ) , and nfb(100)/co(0001 ) are stronger than that of the nfb single phase , and hence , these remanent magnetizations are expected to be improved in real materials . in particular , the magnetizations of tm = fe systems are higher than those of tm = co systems because of the larger local moment of tm = fe systems . as the degree of magnetization depends on the volume of the unit cell ,",
    "a higher magnetization is exhibited for a shorter interlayer distance .",
    "[ fig : suf_fe ]     [ fig : suf_co ]    to understand the unique property of nfb(100)/fe(110 ) , we analyze the local magnetic moments around the nfb(100)/tm interface .",

    "in addition to the local moments at these sites , we also show three local moments on the surface of tm layers ( numbered sites `` 4 , '' `` 5 , '' and `` 6 '' in fig.[fig : surface ] ) , which are the nearest neighbors to sites `` 1 , '' `` 2 , '' and `` 3 , '' respectively .    the interlayer - distance dependence of the local magnetic moments at each site are shown in fig .",

    "we deliberately show the non - optimized results here in order to simplify the discussion .",
    "the absolute values of the local moment increase with increasing interlayer distance , @xmath12 , owing to the electron localization , and these values approach the saturation values .",
    "since the saturation magnetization of co is less than that of fe , the absolute values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( the magnetic moment at site `` @xmath17 '' is represented by @xmath18 ) of the tm = co system are smaller than those of the tm = fe system .",

    "these values reflect the strength of electron localization , which depends on inter - site distances ( e.g. , when @xmath26 , the inter - site distance between sites `` 1 '' and `` 4 , '' @xmath27 , is 2.32  , @xmath28 is 1.8  , and @xmath29 is 1.91  ) .",

    "these results indicate that @xmath36 is easily coupled to the magnetic moments of the tm layer , rather than to those of nfb .",
    "we confirm that the local density of states ( ldos ) at site `` 1 '' for apma strongly depend on @xmath12 , whereas the ldos at site `` 1 '' for pma hardly depend on it [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] . figure [ fig : ldos ] ( b ) shows that the band splitting is reduced with decreasing @xmath12 , which implies an enhancement of the electron itinerant property . a reduction in band splitting with decreasing @xmath12",

    "we conclude that itinerant magnetism at the interface is preferred in apma more than in pma and that it lowers the total electron energy by overcoming the increase of exchange coupling energy .",

    "these local moments shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : locmag ] ( c ) are not as dependent on @xmath12 as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : locmag ] ( a ) are , because the magnetic stiffness of co is greater than that of fe and the magnetization of co is less than that of fe .",
    "@xmath40 in the tm = co system clearly increases from 1.8   to 1.9  , and it is confirmed from fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos ] ( c ) and ( d ) that the band splitting at site `` 1 '' for apma is reduced with decreasing @xmath12 by more than that for pma is .",
    "these results are similar to the results for the tm = fe system , while the behavior of @xmath41 and ldos at site `` 2 '' are different between the tm = co and tm = fe systems .",
    "the inter - site distance between site `` 2 '' and `` 5 '' of the tm = co system is greater than that of the tm = fe system ( e.g. , when @xmath26 , @xmath38 is greater than than @xmath28 by 0.37  ) and a reduction in band splitting with increasing @xmath12 is not clearly observed at site `` 2 '' in the tm = co system , unlike in the tm = fe system .",
    "this band - splitting effect is not observed in other systems of tm = co , and hence , at the interface of the tm = co system , itinerant magnetism does not grow as much as in the tm = fe system .",
    "moreover , a noticeable decrease in @xmath33 , which reflects an enhancement of the itinerant property , occurs near the optimized value of @xmath12 in the case of tm = fe , whereas in the case of tm = co , a noticeable decrease occurs at a value of @xmath12 much smaller than the optimized value .",
    "therefore , anti - parallel states are less likely to occur in real materials of tm = co than in those of tm = fe .",
    "the same can be said of nfb(001)/tm and nfb(110)/tm because their optimized interlayer distances are much greater than those of nfb(100)/tm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freeng ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath42 in both the tm = fe and co systems are not as dependent on @xmath12 as the values of @xmath33 are in the tm = fe and co systems , even though @xmath29 and @xmath39 are not as long as @xmath27 and @xmath37 .",
    "one might think that this is attributed to the fact that @xmath36 is more isolated than @xmath43 owing to nd ions [ i.e. , site `` 1 '' is located in the ( 001 ) plane of nfb , in which nd ions are located , while site `` 3 '' is not located in this plane ] . in practice",
    ", however , nd ions do not affect the magnetic property of nfb(001)/fe(110 ) .",
    "we calculate the nfb(100)/fe(110 ) system by replacing nd ions , which are the nearest neighbors to sites `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' , with fe ions , and confirm that the magnetic properties and interface local moments of this substituted system are similar to those of the unsubstituted system .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the interface coupling property is mainly dependent on the interface structure ( i.e. , inter - atomic distance , coordination number , and atomic positional relationship ) .",

    "improvements in the remanent magnetization were observed in nfb(001)/fe(100 ) , nfb(110)/fe(112 ) , and nfb(100)/co(0001 ) , and it was found , as expected , that the model with tm = fe , rather than that with tm = co , is advantageous to remanence .",
    "the optimized interlayer distance is shortest for nfb(100)/fe(110 ) , and anti - parallel magnetization alignment between nfb and fe layers is preferred . from the analysis of interface magnetic moments and local dos of nfb(100)/fe(110 ) , it was found that interface exchange splitting is reduced with decreasing interlayer distance .",
    "therefore , the total energy of nfb(100)/fe(110 ) is lowered by enhancing the interface itinerant property through anti - ferromagnetic coupling . on the other hand , in nfb(100)/co(0001 ) , interface magnetic moments are not so dependent on the interlayer distance , because the magnetic stiffness of co is greater than that of fe . from the analysis of local dos",
    ", it was confirmed that the interface itinerant property of nfb(100)/co(0001 ) is lower than that of nfb(100)/fe(110 ) owing to the difference of interface structures .",
    "moreover , the optimized interlayer distance of nfb(100)/co(0001 ) is greater than that of nfb(100)/fe(110 ) , and it was predicted that interface anti - ferromagnetic coupling is less likely to occur in real materials of nfb(100)/co(0001 ) .",
    "thus , it is concluded that the magnetic performance of exchange spring multilayer magnets is strongly related to inter - site distance around the interface and magnetic stiffness of the soft magnetic phase .",
