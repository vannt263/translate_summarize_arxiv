    "dispersions of non - spherical colloidal particles are model systems to study a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter ranging from fluid phase separation to the emergence of liquid crystalline ordering .",
    "examples of such systems are clay suspensions @xcite , dispersed gibbsite platelets @xcite , mixtures of silica spheres and silica - coated boehmite rods @xcite , wax disks @xcite , or nonaqueous suspensions of laponite and montmorillonite @xcite . while already pure systems often possess complex liquid crystal phase behavior , binary mixtures additionally may demix into bulk phases with different chemical compositions , e.g.  like in dispersions of disks and spheres @xcite .",
    "such mixtures are often viewed as composed of a primary species ( here the spheres ) that interact with an effective depletion potential that is generated by the second component referred to as the depletion agent ( here the disks ) .",
    "the depletion interaction is primarily attractive with a range of attraction similar to the size of the depletant agent and with a strength that is ruled by the concentration of the depletion agent . under appropriate conditions",
    "the depletion interaction may be sufficiently strong in order to drive a phase transition that is anaologous to the gas - liquid phase separation in simple substances , and that manifests fluid - fluid demixing when regarding the full mixture .",

    "sedimentation was found to influence liquid crystal phase transitions of colloidal platelets @xcite , as well as multi - phase equilibria in mixtures of platelets and ideal polymer @xcite .    the fundamental - measure theory ( fmt )",
    "is an ( approximate ) density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , originally proposed by rosenfeld for additive hard sphere mixtures @xcite .",
    "an early extension to convex non - spherical particles has been given in refs .",
    "when applied to homogeneous and isotropic fluid states , this theory yields the correct second virial coefficient of the equation of state , but fails to recover the exact density functional up to second order in density . to remedy the latter problem , an interpolation between the hard sphere rosenfeld functional and the onsager functional for elongated rods",
    "was proposed @xcite and applied to the bulk isotropic - nematic transition .",

    "previous work was concerned with the formulation of a dft for this model @xcite , and an extension to include rod - rod interaction on the onsager ( second virial ) level @xcite .",
    "predictions for the orientation ordering of the rods at a free interface between ( isotropic ) sphere - rich and sphere - poor phases @xcite were successfully confirmed by simulations @xcite . adding a third component to this system , the fluid demixing phase behavior of ternary mixtures of spheres , rods , and model polymers was found to be rich @xcite .",
    "quenching one of the components led to investigations of hard spheres immersed in random rod networks @xcite , and of the isotropic - nematic transition of rods in matrices of immobilized spheres @xcite .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the introduction of hard platelets to the fmt framework .",
    "central to fmt is the so - called deconvolution of the mayer bond @xmath0 between particles of species @xmath1 and @xmath2 into `` weight functions '' @xmath3 that are characteristic of the shape of particles of each species @xmath1 ; the label @xmath4 indicates the type of weight function .",
    "recall that the mayer bond is related to the pair interaction potential @xmath5 between species @xmath1 and @xmath2 via @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath9 is temperature . for hard bodies @xmath10 if the two particles overlap and @xmath11 otherwise . in the fmt framework a convolution integral",
    "is used to express @xmath0 as a sum of terms each of which is bilinear in the weight functions , i.e.  possesses the structure @xmath12 , where @xmath13 label the species , @xmath14 label the type of weight function , and the asterisk indicates the ( three - dimensional ) convolution .",
    "the weight functions are characteristic of the geometry of single particles , i.e.  vanish ( already ) beyond the physical extent of _ one _ particle .",
    "note that this is different from the behavior of @xmath0 , which extends to larger separations and vanishes provided _ two _ particles do not overlap .",
    "however the convolution of pairs of ( shorter ranged ) weight functions restores the correct ( longer ranged ) non - locality of the mayer bond .",
    "this concept was originally introduced for hard sphere mixtures @xcite .",
    "an extension to arbitrarily shaped convex bodies was proposed in refs.@xcite , which yields the correct second virial coefficients , but gives only an approximation for the mayer bonds .",
    "this is insufficient to describe e.g.  nematic ordering ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "however , obtaining exact deconvolutions is possible in principle , as the cases of the mayer bond between a sphere and a vanishingly thin needle @xcite and between a pair of thin rods @xcite demonstrate .    to give an overview of the general structure of fmt , the weight functions @xmath15 are used to to build so - called weighted densities via convolution with the bare one - body density distribution ( of each species in the case of a mixture ) .",
    "the weighted densities are then input as arguments to an ( analytically given ) excess free energy density , @xmath16 . integrating @xmath16 over space ( and director space in case of anisotropic particles )",
    "yields the excess free energy of the system , which is the only unknown contribution to the grand potential functional being the central quantity in ( classical ) dft . for any external potential ( like describing gravity or a wall ) minimizing the grand potential with respect to the one - body density distribution(s )",
    "gives both the value of the grand potential and the structural information contained in the density profile(s ) .",
    "here we show how to treat platelet - shaped particles and mixtures with both spheres and needles within the same framework .",
    "the relevant weight functions are given and it is shown explicitly how all mayer bonds for the ternary mixture are obtained through convolutions . for two - dimensional hard disks",
    "the rosenfeld functional only yields an approximation for the exact mayer bond . despite this",
    "deficieny the two - dimensional rosenfeld functional is considered to be a useful tool to study inhomogeneous situations , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for an investigation of laser - induced freezing and melting of confined colloidal particles .",
    "the treatment of the sphere - platelet case inevitably leads to the same defect . we do achieve , however , exact deconvolutions of the mayer bonds for platelet - platelet and platelet - needle interactions .    furthermore we treat explicitly contributions to the excess free energy functional that are of third order in densities . while the treatment of second order terms was a crucial input for the original construction of fmt for hard spheres @xcite",
    ", this route has been only recently pursued in detail @xcite , and the authors conclude that they come `` close to the edge of fmt '' in attempting to incorporate properties of the exact expansion of the free energy functional in density on the third virial level into the approximate framework of fmt .",
    "in particular these delicate cases appear when particle touch , i.e.  configurations that are close to the edge of the particles .",
    "hence we approximate the exact third virial level ( the triangle in the diagrammatic mayer @xmath0-expansion ) by terms that are non - vanishing only for cases with common triple intersection of the three particles involved .",
    "global prefactors are used to compensate for the `` lost cases '' @xcite in order to yield reasonable third virial coefficients .    as a test case for the accuracy of the theory we consider the pure system of hard platelets .",
    "this is known to undergo a weak first order isotropic - nematic phase transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the application to thin rods , the onsager ( second virial ) functional for platelets yields only a qualitatively correct account of the phase transition : the transition density , density jump , and value of the nematic order parameter in the coexisting nematic are significantly overestimated .",
    "our theory has the same ( exact ) second order contribution to the free energy , but also sports a further third - order term .",
    "higher than third - order terms are absent due to the scaled - particle roots @xcite of the approach ; the vanishing thickness and hence vanishing volume of the platelets effectively truncates the series .",
    "our results show that fmt considerably improves on the onsager treatment , and yields a quantitatively correct picture , albeit with slightly too small transitition densities .",

    "[ fig : sofmu ] the variation of @xmath17 with @xmath292 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : sofrho ] the variation of @xmath17 with @xmath293 .",
    "we also plot the behavior of the metastable nematic branch , i.e.  for statepoints where the nematic phase remains locally stable against small fluctuations , although globally the grand potential for the isotropic phase is the lower one .",
    "it is apparent that the value of @xmath289 very sensitively depends on the precise location of the phase transition . taking this into account we find the overall the agreement of the fmt results with simulation data to be very reasonable , and to give confidence both into applications to interfacial phenomena of platelets , as well as into the accuracy of the fmt for the full ternary mixture .     for a bulk system of pure hard platelets as a function of the ( scaled ) chemical potential , @xmath292 .",
    "shown are results from fmt in the stable ( solid line ) and metastable ( dashed line ) nematic .",
    "values in the coexisting nematic and isotropic phases , @xmath289 and @xmath294 , are shown as obtained from fmt ( squares ) and the onsager - type second virial treatment ( dots ) . ]    , but as a function of the ( scaled ) density of platelets @xmath295 .",
    "note the considerable reduction of the coexistence density gap obtained from fmt as compared to the onsager - like treatment . ]",
    "in conclusion we have derived a geometry - based density functional theory for hard body mixtures of spheres , platelets and needles .",
    "both the needles and the ( circular ) platelets possess vanishing thickness and hence constitute the simplest examples of prolate and oblate model particles , respectively .",
    "our treatment of the mixture is based on the so - called deconvolution of the mayer bond into single - particle functions which vanish beyond the extent of the particle .",
    "the mayer bonds are recovered upon convolution of the single - particle functions .",
    "the construction of the full functional relies further on controlling the third virial level and on rosenfeld s scaled - particle treatment . in order to facilitate future applications , like wetting of planar walls or capillary phenomena in planar slits",
    ", we have given explicit reduced expressions for the relevant quantities in planar geometry .",
    "in a recent contribution harnau and dietrich propose and apply a dft for binary platelet - sphere mixtures @xcite .",
    "they obtain a platelet - sphere functional by starting from the rod - sphere functional of refs .",
    "@xcite , and in particular from the explicit expressions for the needle weight functions in planar and uniaxial geometry modifying the definition of the relevant angle between the particle orientation and the @xmath100-axis the rod weight functions are taken to play the role of platelet weight functions .",
    "the resulting excess free energy functional is linear in the platelet density , limiting the theory to small densities of platelets .",
    "recall that for binary mixtures where one component ( the depletant ) is ideal , the absence of higher than linear order terms in the density distribution of this component is a good approximation .",
    "examples are the above rod - sphere mixture and the asakura - oosawa model of colloid - polymer mixtures , where the polymers are described as non - interacting spheres . while in these cases",
    "the pure depletant system is an ideal gas , pure platelets constitute an interacting system . hence higher than linear order terms in the platelet density should only be irrelevant at low platelet densities .",
    "the current theory is in accordance with scaled - particle theory @xcite and yields second and third - order contributions to the excess free energy , but higher order terms are absent .",
    "this behavior can be traced back to the vanishing volume of the platelets .    in the present work",
    "we have shown explicitly how our dft for the sphere - platelet mixture reduces to the correct low - density limit .",
    "in contrast to the procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have treated the full three - dimensional problem and have obtained , up to a defect already present for two - dimensional hard disks , the deconvolution of the sphere - platelet mayer bond and hence the appropriate platelet weight functions . projecting those to planar and uniaxial symmetry ( appropriate for fluid states at a planar smooth wall like investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ) reveals that the expresssions differ markedly from those for sphere - rod mixtures .",
    "this might come as no surprise given the fact that the genuine shapes of the particles are one of the building blocks of the geometry - based dft .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the platelet weight functions , and hence the form of the excess free energy functional , also differ from the expressions used in ref.@xcite .",
    "our successful description of the bulk isotropic - nematic transition of hard platelets can be viewed as the first genuine fmt treatment of liquid crystalline ordering in a continuum model ( without any interpolation as e.g.  in ref .",
    "possible future applications of our theory include capillary and wetting phenomena , influence of gravity or other external fields , and the study of free interfaces between demixed ( and possibly liquid crystalline ) phases .",
    "further testing the accuracy of the theory , i.e.for the predictions of the bulk direct correlation functions , see e.g.  @xcite , against results from computer simulations is clearly desirable .",
