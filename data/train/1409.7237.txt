    "2 correspond to the case of imperfect detection efficiency with @xmath81  and optimal gain factors . comparing the green dash - dotted and purple dash - dotted - dotted lines , it is obvious that the quantum discord is decreased due to the imperfect detection efficiency .",

    "it is obvious that the maximum output quantum discord is obtained at @xmath82 , i.e. the ancillary states are two independent coherent states .",
    "this confirms that using coherent state as ancillary state is the simplest way to transfer the gaussian quantum discord .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the dependence of output quantum discord on squeezing parameter and gain factor when an epr entangled state is used as an ancillary state , in which alice s discording noise is fixed to 50 .",
    "the maximum output quantum discord is obtained with optimal squeezing parameter and gain factor . comparing the maximum output quantum discord in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , we find that entanglement is helpful to obtain maximum output quantum discord .",

    "the optimal gain factor is close to unit with the increasing of squeezing parameter .",
    "there is an optimal squeezing that maximize the output quantum discord , which is @xmath78 . in this case , the maximum output gaussian quantum discord of @xmath87 is obtained .",
    "we now analyze the physical reason for why output quantum discord can be higher than initial quantum discord . comparing the covariance matrixes of the initial and output gaussian discordant states , we find that the initial state is a symmetric quantum discordant state , which has same noise variances on its two quantum correlated beams , while the output state is an asymmetric quantum discordant state , which has different noise variances on its two quantum correlated beams .",

    "it is obvious that the quantum discord with attenuation ( red dashed line , @xmath96 ) is higher than that without attenuation ( black solid line , @xmath93 ) when discording noise @xmath97 .",
    "5(b ) shows the dependence of quantum discord on the attenuation @xmath90 at different discording noises .",
    "when @xmath94 ( red dashed line ) , it is clear that there is an optimal attenuation @xmath90 that maximize the quantum discord .",
    "when @xmath98 , the quantum discord is higher than the symmetric gaussian quantum discordant state . however , when @xmath95 ( black solid line ) , the quantum discord of the asymmetric gaussian quantum discordant state is not higher than that of the symmetric one .    a symmetric gaussian discordant state can also be turned into an asymmetric state by attenuate one or both optical modes . here ,",
    "we attenuate the optical modes @xmath8 and @xmath4 by two beam splitters with transmission efficiencies @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the attenuated optical modes become @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath104 , respectively .     and @xmath105 with discording noise @xmath94.,width=302 ]    figure 6 shows the dependence of quantum discord on the attenuations @xmath99 and @xmath100 with discording noise @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the gaussian discordant state is an asymmetric state .",
    "it is obvious that the quantum discord with the optimal attenuation @xmath100 is higher than the discord of a symmetric gaussian discordant state , which corresponds to the quantum discord at @xmath108 .",
    "this is similar to what we obtained in fig .",
    "5(b ) , which confirms that the quantum discord of an asymmetric gaussian discordant state can be higher than a symmetric one with optimal attenuation .",
    "when the attenuation on the mode @xmath8 is also considered , the quantum discord is decreased along with the decrease of @xmath99 .",
    "this is because the asymmetry between two optical modes is reduced by attenuating both modes .",
    "so we draw a conclusion that the quantum discord of an asymmetric gaussian quantum discordant state can be higher than that of a symmetric one prepared in this way when optimal attenuation and discording noise are chosen .",
    "this comes from the fact that the one - way classical correlation @xmath109 is measurement dependent .",
    "the attenuation of one mode ( asymmetry ) lead to the decrease of total and classical correlations , while the difference between them ( quantum discord ) can be increased .",
    "this result is compatible with what obtained by madsen et al in @xcite , where the attenuation of one mode of a gaussian quantum discordant state lead to increasing of quantum discord . in @xcite ,",
    "transmission of one mode of a gaussian discordant state in a lossy channel is mimicked by a beam - splitter with variable transmission efficiency .",
    "they observed the increase of quantum discord along with the increasing of the attenuation , which lead to an asymmetric gaussian quantum discordant state .",
    "this property of gaussian quantum discord will have potential application in quantum information tasks .",
    "for example , in the presented remote transfer scheme , the output quantum discord can be higher than the input discord . since the gaussian quantum discordant state is resilient to loss , it may be used to extend the transmission distance of quantum communication .",
    "in conclusion , a remote transfer scheme of gaussian quantum discord is proposed .",
    "the quantum correlation emerges between two independent quantum modes that without direct interaction after the remote transfer . in the remote transfer scheme with a gaussian discordant state as ancillary state ,",
    "the output quantum discord is independent on discording noise of the ancillary state when unit gain is chosen .",
    "the maximum output quantum discord is obtained with two independent coherent states as ancillary state in the case of optimal gain . in the remote transfer scheme with an epr",
    "entangled state as ancillary state , the maximum output quantum discord is obtained when optimal squeezing and gain are chosen . comparing schemes with a gaussian quantum discordant state and an epr",
    "entangled state as ancillary state , we find that entanglement in the ancillary state is helpful to improve the output quantum discord .",
    "notably , the output gaussian quantum discord can be higher than the initial quantum discord .",
    "the physical reason for this phenomenon is that the quantum discord of an asymmetric gaussian quantum discordant state can be higher than that of a symmetric one .",
    "the remote transfer of gaussian quantum discord has potential application in the quantum information network .",
