    "consider two parties , alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) , who are not able to communicate but have access to physical states that they can use to generate joint correlations .",
    "the generation of correlation can be regarded as an experiment in which both parties decide to measure the state of their system , and the outcomes of their measurements are given by random variables .",
    "classical as well as quantum theories put limits on non - local correlations that can be generated between separated sites when no communication is available . in particular ,",
    "both classical and quantum theories do not violate the no - signaling condition of special relativity , i.e. the local choice of measurements may not lead to observable differences on the other end .",
    "the limits on the strength of correlations generated in the framework of any classical theory ( i.e. a theory based on local hidden variables ) are known as _ bell inequalities _",
    "a well - known variant of a bell inequality is the  @xcite ( chsh ) inequality , which can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the choice of alice s and bob s measurement , @xmath3 and @xmath4 the respective binary outcomes , and @xmath5 addition modulo @xmath6 .",
    "the theory of quantum mechanics allows the violation of this inequality , but curiously only up to a maximal value of @xmath7 which is known as _",
    "cirelson s bound _  @xcite .",
    "since special relativity allows a violation of cirelson s bound ,  @xcite raised the question why nature is not more `` non - local '' ?",
    "that is , why does quantum mechanics not allow for a stronger violation of the chsh inequality up to the maximal value of 4 ? to gain more insight into this question , they constructed a toy - theory based on so - called _ non - local boxes_. each such box takes inputs @xmath8 from alice and bob respectively and outputs measurement outcomes @xmath9,@xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "note that alice and bob still can not use this box to transmit any information .",
    "however , since for all @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the above sum equals 4 and thus non - local boxes lead to a maximum violation of the chsh inequality .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relationship between nonlocality and cryptography . as it has been shown",
    ", classical as well as quantum mechanics do not allow for the construction of unconditionally secure bit commitment and oblivious transfer without additional assumptions .",
    "thus it is a fundamental problem to assess whether _ any _ theory that generates correlations renders these cryptographic primitives possible , while simultaneously preserving the no - signaling constraint of special relativity . here",
    ", we show that two parties with access to the primitive of non - local boxes as described above are indeed able to perform unconditionally secure bit commitment ( bc ) as well as one - out - of - two oblivious transfer ( 1 - 2 ot ) .",
    "a bit commitment protocol allows alice and bob to perform the following task : alice has chosen a bit @xmath15 , and wants to convince bob that her choice is made without revealing the actual value of @xmath15 . since bob is inherently mistrustful , alice sends him some piece of evidence that she made up her mind",
    ". however , bob still has insufficient information to obtain @xmath15 .",
    "later on , alice tells bob her choice @xmath16 and bob verifies that alice is honest ( @xmath17 ) using the piece of evidence from alice .",
    "the problem of oblivious transfer was introduced by  @xcite .",
    "the variant of 1 - 2 ot first appeared in a paper by even , goldreich and lempel  @xcite and also , under a different name , in the well - known paper by  @xcite . 1 - 2 ot allows alice and bob to solve a seemingly uninteresting problem : alice has two bits @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "bob wants to learn one of them , but does not want to disclose to alice which bit he is interested in .",
    "however , bob should also be restricted to learning only one of alice s inputs .",
    "it turns out that given 1 - 2 ot we can perform any kind of two - party secure computation  @xcite .",
    "it has been understood for a long time that noisy channels and preshared noisy correlations are sufficient to implement secure two - party computations , via 1 - 2 ot .",
    "@xcite has shown that noisy `` cryptogates '' ( primitives with inputs and outputs for each of the two players ) can generically be used to implement 1 - 2 ot .",
    "based on the techniques of that paper one would expect that non - local boxes would permit 1 - 2 ot , since they provide some intrinsic noise .",
    "this is indeed the case , but for more subtle reasons , as we shall discuss in the present paper .",
    "we would also like to draw the reader s attention to the work of  @xcite , who shows that access to perfect non - local boxes allows alice and bob to perform any kind of distributed computation by transmitting only a single bit of information .",
    "this is even true for slightly less perfect boxes achieving weaker correlations  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite suggested that 1 - 2 ot can be constructed using one non - local box alone .",
    "however , their version of 1 - 2 ot implicitly assumes that the non - local box acts as a kind of cryptogate : either the box has to wait until both players provide their input before it produces output , or its use is timed in the sense that the protocol will demand an input at a certain moment , and if a player does not supply one , uses a standard input instead ( say , 0 ) .",
    "notice that the first possibility runs somewhat counter to the spirit of non - local boxes , as it would allow signaling by delaying or not delaying an input .",
    "non - local boxes , however , can not be used to signal . that this assumption of synchronous input / usage of the box is vital to the result of wolf and wullschleger",
    "can easily be seen : without this assumption , bob can delay his choice of the selection bit indefinitely by simply deferring his use of the non - local box .",
    "this makes an important difference in reductions to 1 - 2 ot .",
    "consider for example the standard reduction of ot to 1 - 2 ot ( see section @xmath20 for definitions ) : the sender uses inputs @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the receiver uses input @xmath24 .",
    "the players now perform 1 - 2 ot@xmath25 after which the receiver holds @xmath26",
    ". then the sender announces @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , the receiver succeeds in retrieving @xmath15 and otherwise he learns nothing",
    "this happens with probability @xmath29 and thus we have constructed ot from one instance of 1 - 2 ot .",
    "clearly , this reduction fails if we use 1 - 2 ot based on the type of boxes suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the receiver simply waits for the announcement of @xmath27 to retrieve @xmath15 with probability @xmath30 .",
    "this was noticed independently by  @xcite .",
    "however , the protocol of wolf and wullschleger forms a useful basis for our construction of 1 - 2 ot in section  [ ot ] .      here , we demonstrate how to circumvent the problem of delay and construct a protocol for bit commitment and 1 - 2 ot based on non - local boxes .",
    "this shows that superstrong non - local correlations in the form of non - local boxes enable us to solve cryptographic problems otherwise known to be impossible .",
    "our work therefore creates a link between cryptographic problems and the nature of non - locality .",
    "in particular , our result implies that the no - signaling principle and secure computation are compatible in principle .",
    "notation and definitions are introduced in section  [ prelim ] .",
    "section  [ bc ] presents a protocol for bit commitment based on non - local boxes . finally , in section  [ ot ]",
    ", we show how to obtain 1 - 2 ot using the same type of boxes .",
    "throughout this text , we say `` alice _ picks @xmath12 _ '' if alice chooses @xmath12 independently at random from the uniform distribution over all strings of a certain length .",
    "we write @xmath31 $ ] for @xmath32 , and @xmath33 if @xmath13 is chosen uniformly at random from @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath35 to denote the inner product @xmath36 between strings @xmath37 and @xmath38 from @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , for strings @xmath40 we define @xmath41 recursively : for the empty word @xmath42 define @xmath43 . for @xmath44 and",
    "strings @xmath45 define @xmath46 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "informally , for strings @xmath12 of even length , @xmath49 is the number of substrings `` @xmath50 '' in @xmath12 starting at an odd position .      throughout this text",
    ", we call the participant in a protocol _ honest _ if he follows the protocol . since we are only interested in the case of unconditional security , a",
    "_ dishonest _",
    "participant is not restricted in any way .",
    "in particular , he may lie about his own input , deviate from the protocol , or even abort the protocol completely .      a non - local box ( nl box ) ,",
    "sometimes also referred to as popescu - rohrlich box , can be seen as a two - party primitive , generating correlations  @xcite .    a _ non - local box ( nl box )",
    "_ is a two - party primitive between alice and bob , in which alice can input a bit @xmath1 and obtains an outcome @xmath51 and bob can input @xmath2 and obtains outcome @xmath52 such that the following holds :    * once alice inputs @xmath1 , she instantaneously receives outcome @xmath51 , * once bob inputs @xmath2 , he instantaneously receives outcome @xmath52 ,    such that @xmath53 .",
    "further , we demand that for all @xmath54 @xmath55 = pr[b = c_1|x = c_2,y = c_3]=1/2.\\ ] ]    observe that the last condition implies that these boxes can not be used to signal , because the outcome of @xmath56 is independent of @xmath12 and @xmath13 and also @xmath15 is independent of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that specifying the statistics of the primitive as we did , and disregarding the fact that outputs are obtained immediately after giving a local input , a non - local box is simply a special bidirectional channel , as proposed by  @xcite .",
    "of course , in general such channels can not give an output immediately without having both inputs ; non - local boxes _ can _ , because they have no signaling capacity .",
    "observe furthermore that the behaviour described in the definition parallels quantum mechanical experiments on entangled states : the outcomes are correlated in a way reflecting the measurement settings , but each experimenter obtains his outputs immediately .",
    "note that both alice and bob can wait indefinitely before providing their input to the nl box .",
    "once they use the box , however , they will only obtain an outcome in accordance with the condition given above .",
    "we say that alice or bob _ delay _ the use of their box , if they wait longer than a given protocol dictates before providing their input to the nl box .",
    "bit commitment is a well known cryptographic primitive that plays an important role in many other cryptographic protocols .",
    "it is defined as follows :    [ defcomm ] _ bit commitment _ _ ( bc ) _ is a two - party protocol between alice ( the committer ) and bob ( the verifier ) , which consists of two stages , the committing and the revealing stage , and a final declaration stage in which bob declares `` accept '' or `` reject '' .",
    "the following requirements should hold :    * ( correctness ) if both alice and bob are honest , then before the committing stage alice decides on a bit @xmath57 .",

    "we say that _ alice cheats _",
    "if she chooses a bit @xmath58 only after the committing stage and tries to get bob to accept @xmath58 during the revealing stage .",
    "we also say that _ alice cheats successfully _ , if bob accepts the chosen @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , we say that _ bob cheats _ if he tries to obtain @xmath57 before the revealing stage .",
    "_ bob cheats successfully _ if he obtains the correct @xmath57 before the revealing stage .",
    "note that our protocol for bit commitment is probabilistic and thus achieves statistical security for a security parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the sum of acceptance probabilities in the binding condition only needs to be smaller than @xmath61 for some @xmath62 .",

    "* bob computes @xmath203 . *",
    "alice picks @xmath204 , sets @xmath205 and announces @xmath206 to bob .",
    "bob picks @xmath207 $ ] , subject to @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , @xmath211 .",
    "he announces @xmath212 , @xmath213 to alice .",
    "alice receives @xmath212 ,",
    "@xmath213 , checks that @xmath209 and otherwise aborts the protocol .",
    "she computes @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "she announces @xmath216,@xmath217 to bob .",
    "bob now computes @xmath218 .",
    "we first need to show that if both parties are honest , bob succeeds in retrieving @xmath26 with high probability .",
    "note that bob can retrieve @xmath26 , if he can construct a set @xmath219 $ ] with @xmath220 where @xmath221 , since only then @xmath222 and he can compute @xmath223 we are thus interested in the probability of bob constructing such a set successfully .",
    "let @xmath224 be the random variable such that @xmath225 .",
    "note that since alice and bob choose @xmath206 and @xmath226 independently uniformly at random , the random variable @xmath227 is binomially distributed . from hoeffding s inequality  @xcite",
    "we obtain @xmath228 then , @xmath229 where the last inequality comes from equation  ( [ hoeffding ] ) .",
    "thus the probability of bob failing is exponentially small in @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that bob is honest , but alice tries to learn @xmath57 .",
    "as outlined in section  [ prelim ] , nl boxes do not allow signaling and therefore alice learns nothing during step 1 of the protocol .",
    "due to the concealing properties of the bit commitment scheme , alice s information gain in step 2 is negligible for a sufficiently large security parameter @xmath27 .",
    "thus the only time she receives information from bob is during step 4 . note that bob picks @xmath189 independently of @xmath206 .",
    "alice has no information on @xmath226 .",
    "this means that the elements of the sets @xmath212 and @xmath213 are independent of @xmath57 from alice s point of view : their composition depends only on whether @xmath230 for a given @xmath160 .",
    "alice thus learns nothing from observing the sets @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "note that alice gains nothing from trying to delay her own boxes : by delaying boxes in the commitment protocol employed in step 2 , she will only remain more ignorant about bob s commitment .",
    "furthermore , each round @xmath160 in step 1 corresponds to alice using an erasure channel with input @xmath205 , because the following two conditions are satisfied : step 2 ensures us that bob uses this channel , and , since alice sends @xmath206 to bob during step 3 , bob knows whether he obtained @xmath231 .",
    "the situation where alice delays using the boxes is equivalent to using the channel with a randomly chosen input and gives her no additional advantage .",
    "since we can construct an erasure channel , we thus obtain an 1 - 2 ot via the above construction  @xcite .",
    "now suppose that alice is honest , but bob tries to learn more than @xmath26 .",
    "we now show that bob can retrieve exactly one of the bits @xmath184 .",
    "in particular , we show that he can not compute any function @xmath232 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 which depends on both input bits .",
    "depends on the @xmath233-th input argument if there is an input to @xmath232 such that changing the @xmath233-th argument changes the value of @xmath232 . ]    because alice is honest , all @xmath231 are independent .",
    "furthermore , since the sets @xmath212 and @xmath213 are disjoint , it follows that @xmath234 and @xmath235 are independent .",
    "all bob receives from alice is @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "thus , in order to compute any function @xmath232 of @xmath184 which depends on both input bits , bob needs to learn both @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "bob will only obtain @xmath238 and @xmath239 and then also learn more than one of the bits @xmath184 , if he succeeds in creating two sets @xmath240 $ ] with @xmath209 and @xmath208 such that @xmath241 .",
    "we are therefore interested in the probability that bob can successfully construct two such sets .    in order to construct such sets , bob may try to delay using some of the nl boxes during step 1 .",
    "this will enable him to wait for the announcement in step 3 , to force @xmath242 and obtain @xmath243 with certainty . by assumption ,",
    "the bit commitment scheme is binding for sufficiently large @xmath27 and thus bob can not try to fool alice by breaking the commitment itself .",
    "however , he can try to commit to random values and escape detection during step 2 .",
    "in particular , he can choose to be honest in step 1 for exactly one nl box in runs @xmath160 and @xmath244 .",
    "without loss of generality , suppose he was honest in run @xmath244 and delayed use of the box in run @xmath160 .",
    "he then commits once to the outcome of the honest box , and once to @xmath245 and a random @xmath246 .",
    "the probability that alice challenges him on the box he has been honest with in step 1 is @xmath71 .",
    "then he has succeeded to cheat on one of the bits , @xmath189 , and will obtain @xmath243 with certainty . however , with probability @xmath71 alice will challenge him on the other nl box . in this case",
    "he can escape detection with probability @xmath71 : he announces @xmath189 and @xmath122 and hopes that this matches the input of alice s box .",
    "he will have committed to the correct @xmath122 with probability 1/2 and then he escapes detection .",
    "thus the total probability of cheating successfully on one of the bits is given by @xmath247 .",
    "let @xmath248 $ ] with @xmath249 , @xmath250 denote the set of indices on which bob tries to deceive alice .",
    "he will remain undetected with probability @xmath251 suppose now , that bob successfully cheated on @xmath27 bits .",
    "we are then interested in bounding the probability of constructing two valid sets if bob already has @xmath27 valid entries .",
    "note that we now only consider the probability of achieving @xmath211 for indices @xmath252 and then @xmath253 . for @xmath254 , @xmath255",
    "if @xmath256 , bob will be caught with probability @xmath257 .",
    "thus the probability of bob deceiving alice can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath60 large .",
    "we have shown how to obtain protocols for bit commitment and one - out - of - two oblivious transfer given access to non - local boxes .",
    "this creates a link between cryptographic problems , which may appear very artificial , and non - local correlations : if such nl boxes were available in nature , we could implement these cryptographic protocols securely which is known to be impossible to achieve using quantum mechanics alone .",
    "interestingly , the quantum mechanical impossibility proofs for bit commitment and coin tossing   via the so - called epr - attack are the quantum version of delaying the input .",
    "one may want to go back to explore why we could circumvent this attack here , and the reason seems to be that the nl box is more like a quantum mechanical entangled state _ together with an encasing experimental setup _ , which enforces that the particles can only be measured separately .",
    "in contrast , for the epr - attack to work , alice has to be able to perform arbitrary collective operations on her qubits .",
