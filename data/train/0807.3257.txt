    "finitely many real polynomials @xmath9={\\mathbb r}[x_1,\\ldots , x_n]$ ] define a basic closed semi - algebraic set @xmath10 one is interested in finding characterizations of @xmath11 , the set of all polynomials that are nonnegative on @xmath7 .",
    "obvious candidates for such nonnegative polynomials are the elements of @xmath12 ^ 2\\right\\},\\ ] ] the so called _ preordering _ generated by @xmath13 .",
    "many works in real algebra and real algebraic geometry deal with the question how @xmath2 relates to @xmath11 . in dimension one , equality occurs often , at least if the @xmath14 are the so called _ natural generators _ for @xmath7 ( see @xcite ) . in dimension two , equality is a much more uncommon phenomenon .",
    "for example , not every globally nonnegative polynomial in two variables is a sum of squares of polynomials .",
    "however , scheiderer has given two local global principles that yield equality between @xmath2 and @xmath11 under certain conditions , in the case that @xmath7 is compact and two - dimensional ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the results require a good behavior of the curves bounding @xmath7 .",
    "noncompact two - dimensional examples where equality holds are even more rare .",
    "one of the few known examples is the preordering generated by @xmath15 in @xmath16 $ ] , see @xcite . from dimension three upwards , equality between @xmath2 and @xmath11",
    "is never possible .",
    "this is one of the main results from @xcite .",
    "of course one can ask questions beside equality . for example , schmdgen s famous result from @xcite says that in case @xmath7 is compact , @xmath2 contains every polynomial which is _ strictly _ positive on @xmath7 , no matter what generators @xmath13 of @xmath7 are chosen , and independent of the dimension of @xmath7",
    ". however , this result fails in general if @xmath7 is not compact . if @xmath7 is very big , for example if it contains a full dimensional cone , then the preordering is indeed far from containing every nonnegative or positive polynomial ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "another question arising in this context concerns the @xmath7-_moment problem_. one wants to find a characterization of the linear functionals @xmath17\\rightarrow{\\mathbb r}$ ] that are integration on @xmath7 .",
    "haviland s theorem ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) provides a necessary and sufficient condition .",
    "namely , @xmath18 is integration on @xmath7 if and only if @xmath18 is @xmath19 on @xmath11 . as a characterization of @xmath11 is not very simple either , one wants to weaken the condition on @xmath18 and still apply haviland s theorem .",
    "more precisely , one wants to know whether @xmath20 on @xmath2 is sufficient for @xmath18 to be integration . in view of haviland s theorem , that means to ask whether @xmath21 holds , where @xmath8 denotes the _",
    "double dual cone _ of the preordering .",
    "one says that the preordering has the _ strong moment property _ ( smp ) in this case .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is compact , then by the above mentioned schmdgen theorem , the preordering always has ( smp ) .",
    "there are also many noncompact examples .",
    "@xcite gives a criterion to decide this question , involving _ fibre - preorderings _ constructed from bounded polynomials .",
    "now in @xcite , the following preordering is considered : @xmath22\\mid \\exists q\\in{\\mathbb r}[\\underline{x}]\\ \\forall { \\varepsilon}>0\\ f+{\\varepsilon}q\\in\\operatorname{po}(f_1,\\ldots , f_s)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] this definition does not use linear functionals and is therefore better accessible to algebraic methods .",
    "@xmath23 turns out to be the _ sequential closure _ of @xmath2 with respect to the finest locally convex topology on @xmath24 $ ] , whereas @xmath8 is the _",
    "closure_. the following relations hold : @xmath25 in @xcite , theorem 5.1 , it is shown that every element from @xmath11 belongs to the sequential closure of the preordering in a certain _ localization _ of the polynomial ring . a slightly weaker version of that is @xcite , theorem 6.2.3 .",
    "the authors of @xcite prove @xmath26 ( and therefore ( smp ) ) for certain classes of preorderings in the polynomial ring .",
    "the question whether in polynomial rings @xmath27 always holds remained open in these works ( see open problem 3 in @xcite and open problem 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we solve this problem by providing a counterexample ; @xmath23 does not equal @xmath8 in general .    then it is natural to ask for conditions under which equality holds .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether a fibre theorem in the spirit of @xcite can be established for @xmath23 instead of @xmath8 .",
    "this question already turned up in @xcite .",
    "our counterexample implies that such a general theorem will require stricter assumptions than schmdgen s fibre theorem .",
    "theorem 5.3 from @xcite is such a fibre theorem for finitely generated preorderings that describe cylinders with compact cross section .",
    "we will generalize this result to quadratic modules in arbitrary commutative algebras .",
    "we will then deduce criterions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 to hold .",
    "they allow applications that go beyond the known examples from @xcite .",
    "* acknowledgements * the author thanks murray marshall and claus scheiderer for interesting and helpful discussions on the topic of this work .",
    "for the following results on topological vector spaces we refer to @xcite , chapter ii .",
    "let @xmath29 be an @xmath30-vector space .",
    "finest locally convex topology _ on @xmath29 is the vector space topology having the collection of all convex , absorbing and symmetric subsets of @xmath29 as a neighborhood base of zero .",
    "all the linear functionals on @xmath29 are continuous , @xmath29 is hausdorff , and every finite dimensional subspace of @xmath29 inherits the canonical topology . by @xcite , chapter 2 ,",
    "exercise 7(b ) , a sequence in @xmath29 converges if and only if it lies in a finite dimensional subspace of @xmath29 and converges there .",
    "so for the _ sequential closure _ of a set @xmath31 in @xmath29 , defined as the set of all limits of sequences from @xmath31 , and denoted by @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 where the union runs over all finite dimensional subspaces @xmath34 of @xmath29 .",
    "from now on , we will restrict ourself to _ convex cones _ in @xmath29 , i.e. to subsets @xmath31 that are closed under addition and multiplication with positive reals .",
    "the following alternative characterization for @xmath32 can be found in @xcite : @xmath35 for preorderings @xmath31 in @xmath30-algebras , the object @xmath32 was first introduced in @xcite in terms of this last characterization .",
    "it only turned out later that it is the sequential closure of @xmath31 .",
    "the _ closure _ of a convex cone @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath36 @xcite , chapter ii.39 , corollary 5 implies @xmath37 for convex cones .",
    "here , @xmath38 denotes the double dual cone of @xmath31 , i.e. the set @xmath39 we obviously have @xmath40 if @xmath29 has countable vector space dimension , then a set @xmath31 in @xmath29 is closed if and only if its intersection with every finite dimensional subspace of @xmath29 is closed , by @xcite , proposition 1 .",
    "so @xmath31 is closed if and only if it is sequentially closed , i.e. if @xmath41 holds .",
    "this implies that the ( transfinite ) sequence of _ iterated sequential closures _ of @xmath31 terminates at @xmath42 in that case .",
    "note that in case @xmath29 is not countable dimensional , then this sequence may terminate before it reaches the closure .",
    "it indeed always terminates at the closure with respect to the _ topology of finitely open sets _ , which can be smaller in the case of uncountable dimension .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more information .",
    "now let @xmath43 be a commutative @xmath30-algebra with @xmath44 .",
    "of course @xmath43 is an @xmath30-vector space , and we equip it with the finest locally convex topology .",
    "quadratic module _ is a set @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 here , @xmath48 denotes the set of squares in @xmath43 .",
    "a _ preordering _ is a quadratic module with the additional property @xmath49 quadratic modules ( and preorderings ) are convex cones , and we look at @xmath32 and @xmath50 defined as above .    for a set @xmath51",
    ", the smallest quadratic module / preordering containing @xmath52 is called the quadratic module / preordering _ generated _ by @xmath52 .",
    "we write @xmath53 and @xmath54 for it , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 consists of all finite sums of elements @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath55 is a sum of squares in @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath54 consists of all finite sums of elements @xmath58 , where @xmath55 is a sum of squares , @xmath59 and all @xmath60 . of special interest",
    "is the case that @xmath52 is finite .",
    "we call @xmath53 and @xmath54 _ finitely generated _ then .    an important notion , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "is that of _ stability _ of a finitely generated quadratic module .",
    "if @xmath31 is generated by @xmath61 , then we call @xmath31 _ stable _ , if for every finite dimensional @xmath30-subspace @xmath62 of @xmath43 there is another finite dimensional @xmath30-subspace @xmath63 of @xmath43 , such that @xmath64 a map that assigns to each @xmath62 such a @xmath63 is then called a _ stability map_. whereas the notion of stability is independent of the choice of generators of @xmath31 , the stability map is not .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for proofs and details .    to @xmath43",
    "there corresponds the set of all real characters on @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath65 elements @xmath66 from @xmath43 define functions @xmath67 on @xmath68 by @xmath69 we equip @xmath68 with the coarsest topology making all these functions continuous . as the functions @xmath67 separate points , this makes @xmath68 a hausdorff space , and we have the algebra homomorphism @xmath70 if @xmath43 is finitely generated as an @xmath30-algebra , then @xmath68 embeds into some @xmath1 , by taking generators @xmath71 and sending @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "so @xmath68 is the zero set in @xmath1 of the kernel of the algebra homomorphism @xmath74\\rightarrow a ; x_i\\mapsto x_i$ ] .",
    "the use of an element @xmath66 from @xmath43 as a function @xmath67 coincides with the usual use of @xmath66 as a polynomial function on that embedded variety . in particular , the topology on @xmath68 is inherited from the canonical one on @xmath1 .",
    "note also that @xmath43 is a countable dimensional @xmath30-vector space in case it is finitely generated as an @xmath30-algebra .",
    "now we consider arbitrary commutative @xmath30-algebras @xmath43 with @xmath44 again .",
    "for a set @xmath75 , without loss of generality a quadratic module , we define @xmath76 if @xmath31 is finitely generated , then @xmath77 is called a _ basic closed semi - algebraic set_. for any set",
    "@xmath78 we define @xmath79 this is a preordering . starting with a quadratic module or a preordering @xmath31 in @xmath43 , we have the following chain :    @xmath80 the last inclusion comes from the fact that characters on @xmath43 are in particular linear functionals . as for example proven in @xcite , @xmath32 and @xmath38 are again quadratic modules , even preorderings if @xmath31 was a preordering .",
    "following @xcite , we make the following definitions .",
    "[ smpdd ]    * @xmath31 has the _ strong moment property _ ( smp ) , if @xmath81 holds * @xmath31 has the _ @xmath82-property _ , if @xmath83 holds * @xmath31 is _ saturated _ , if @xmath84 holds * @xmath31 is _ closed _ , if @xmath85 holds    the interest in @xmath86 and ( smp ) is motivated by a classical theorem by haviland . for certain classes of algebras ,",
    "it states that a linear functional on @xmath43 is integration with respect to some measure on @xmath77 , if and only if it is nonnegative on @xmath87 ( @xcite in the case that @xmath43 is a polynomial algebra , see @xcite for a more general version ) .",
    "so if @xmath31 has ( smp ) , then every functional that is nonnegative on @xmath31 is integration on @xmath77 .",
    "nonnegativity on @xmath31 is a priori a much weaker condition than nonnegativity on @xmath88 this is one of the reasons that make ( smp ) so interesting .",
    "a method to decide whether ( smp ) holds for a finitely generated preordering @xmath89 in @xmath24 $ ] is given in @xcite , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath90 be a polynomial that is bounded on @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 holds , where @xmath93 denotes the ideal generated by @xmath94 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 has ( smp ) if and only if all the preorderings @xmath95 have ( smp ) .",
    "as these so called _ fibre preorderings _ usually describe lower dimensional semi - algebraic sets , they are easier to deal with in general . the result in particular implies that every finitely generated preordering in @xmath24 $ ] describing a compact set @xmath91 has ( smp ) .",
    "this was already part of the earlier paper @xcite .",
    "for an alternative proof of the result from @xcite see also @xcite .",
    "the @xmath82-property was introduced and studied in @xcite for polynomial algebras .",
    "the authors for example show that in case @xmath91 is a cylinder with compact cross section , then the preordering @xmath89 has the @xmath82-property , under reasonable assumptions on the generators of @xmath89 .",
    "this is also shown , using different methods , in @xcite .",
    "it was an open problem in @xcite , whether ( smp ) and the @xmath82-property are equivalent or even @xmath96 is always true .",
    "we start by showing that the answer to both questions is negative .",
    "the example in this section will answer open problem 3 in @xcite and open problem 2 in @xcite to the negative .",
    "it will also give a negative answer to the question in @xcite , whether the fibre theorem holds for the @xmath82-property instead of ( smp ) .",
    "consider @xmath97 $ ] , the polynomial algebra in two variables , and @xmath98 these polynomials define the following basic closed semi - algebraic set @xmath99 in @xmath100 :    * *    [ smp ] the preordering @xmath101 in @xmath16 $ ] has ( smp )    the polynomial @xmath102 is bounded on @xmath99 , and we can apply schmdgen s fibre theorem from @xcite to @xmath89 . for any @xmath103 $ ] , the preordering @xmath104 describes a compact semi - algebraic set and therefore has ( smp ) by @xcite ( even the ( @xmath105)-property ) . for @xmath106 $ ]",
    ", the preordering @xmath107 $ ] is saturated .",

    "so @xmath108 in @xmath16 $ ] is saturated as well . in particular",
    ", @xmath109 has ( smp ) .",
    "so by @xcite , the whole preordering @xmath89 has ( smp ) .",
    "the next result is a characterization of @xmath110 .",

    "the `` if''-part is a consequence of theorem @xmath121 below ( or can already be obtained by looking at the proof of theorem 5.3 . in @xcite ) .",

    "however , the degree as polynomials in @xmath130 can not rise ; it is bounded by the @xmath130-degree of @xmath131 , which does not change with @xmath129 .",
    "this is because the set @xmath99 contains the cylinder @xmath132\\times [ 1,\\infty]$ ] , so whenever one adds two polynomials which are nonnegative on it , the leading terms as polynomials in @xmath130 can not cancel .",
    "so the degree in @xmath130 of the sum is the maximum of the @xmath130-degrees of the terms .    by evaluating in @xmath133 ,",

    "note that @xmath130 is not in @xmath110 as it fails to be in the preordering corresponding to the fibre @xmath143 .",
