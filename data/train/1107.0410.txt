    "therefore the behavior with respect to @xmath377 of the second sum in ( [ f1 ] ) is of order @xmath378 again , since either @xmath379 or @xmath380 , the behavior of the term is at most of order @xmath367 .",
    "therefore @xmath317 where the constant @xmath381 is given by ( [ c0 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the sum over @xmath382 is finite is a consequence of the following argument : @xmath303 belongs to @xmath383 ( which is true based on the derivation rule - exercise 1.2.13 in @xcite- and since @xmath91 belongs to @xmath384 as a consequence of proposition 1.2.3 in @xcite ) , this implies that @xmath385 for every @xmath128 where @xmath386 is given by ( [ hnm ] ) .",
