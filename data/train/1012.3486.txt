    "the ridge structure in two - particle correlation has been studied in nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) for several years @xcite and is now also seen in @xmath5 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the nature of that structure is that it is narrow in @xmath6 ( azimuthal angle @xmath7 relative to that of the trigger ) but broad in @xmath0 ( pseudorapidity @xmath1 relative to the trigger ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the range in @xmath0 is found to be as large as 4 .",
    "so far there is no consensus on the origin of the ridge formation .",
    "it has been pointed out that the wide @xmath0 distribution implies long - range correlation @xcite .",
    "that is a view based mainly on theoretical ideas without any comparison between the @xmath1 ranges of single - particle distribution and two - particle correlation .",
    "we make that comparison here using only experimental data from phobos @xcite .",
    "it is found that the large @xmath0 ridge  is related simply to a shift of the pseudorapidity  and an integral over the trigger @xmath1 .",
    "that is a phenomenological observation without any theoretical input .",
    "any successful model of ridge formation should be able to explain that relationship .",
    "there are subtleties about the single - particle  for all charges , @xmath8 , that to our knowledge has not been satisfactorily explained in all its details . since it sums over all charges , hadrons of different types are included , making @xmath8 to be quite different from @xmath9 .",
    "that difference can not be readily accounted for in any simple hadronization scheme .",
    "fortunately , detailed examination of @xmath8 is not required before we find its relationship to the ridge  @xmath10 , since both are for unidentified charged hadrons , and the empirical verification is based on the data from the same experimental group ( phobos ) .    after the phenomenological relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath8",
    "is established in sec .  2 , we give an interpretation of the phenomenon in sec .",
    "it is not our objective to give a review of all other models that can reproduce the data on the ridge structure and assess their likelihood to explain the empirical observation made in sec .  2 .",
    "we offer only to show the possibility , contrary to conventional wisdom , that there is no need for long - range longitudinal correlation .",
    "our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "our focus is on the phobos data on two - particle correlation measured with a trigger particle having transverse momentum @xmath11 gev / c in au + au collisions at @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the pseudorapidity acceptance of the trigger is @xmath13 .",
    "the per - trigger ridge yield integrated over @xmath14 , denoted by @xmath15 , includes all charged hadrons with @xmath16 mev / c at @xmath17 and @xmath18 mev / c at @xmath19 , where the superscript @xmath20 stands for associated particle in the ridge .",
    "for simplicity we use the notation @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "since all ridge particles are included in the range @xmath14 , no further consideration is given to the @xmath7 dependence .",
    "our aim is to relate the ridge distribution in @xmath0 to the single - particle distribution in @xmath1 .",
    "we first make a phenomenological observation using only phobos data for both distributions . after showing their relationship",
    ", we then make an interpretation that does not involve extensive modeling .    to do meaningful comparison",
    ", it is important to use single - particle @xmath1 distribution , @xmath8 , that has the same kinematical constraints as the ridge distribution .",
    "that is , it involves an integration over @xmath27 and a sum over all charged hadrons @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and the lower limit of the @xmath27 integration is @xmath30 mev / c in keeping with the acceptance window of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the data on @xmath15 are for 0 - 30% centrality .",
    "phobos has the appropriate @xmath8 for 0 - 6% , 6 - 15% , 15 - 25% and 25 - 35% centralities @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "thus we average them over those four bins . the result is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) by the small circles for 0 - 30% centrality .",
    "those points are fitted by the three gaussian s , located at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 + a_1\\exp[-(\\eta-\\hat\\eta)^2/{2\\sigma_1 ^ 2 } ] + a_1\\exp[-(\\eta+\\hat\\eta)^2/{2\\sigma_1 ^ 2}]\\ }   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shown by the solid ( red ) line in that figure with @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed line shows the central gaussian , while the dash - dotted line shows the two side gaussians .",
    "the purpose of the fit is only to give an analytic representation of @xmath8 to be used for comparison with the ridge distribution .",
    "note that @xmath36 is large @xmath37 , and thus stretches the width of the @xmath1 .",
    "gev for ( a ) various centrality bins and ( b ) 0 - 30% centrality .",

    "the ( red ) line in ( b ) is a fit using eq .",

    "we now propose the formula @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a parameter that summarizes all the experimental conditions that lead to the magnitude of the ridge distribution measured relative to the single - particle distribution .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath40 or @xmath41 ; otherwise , the equation is meaningless in comparing the @xmath1 dependencies .    there is no theoretical input in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , except for the question behind the proposal : how much of the @xmath0 distribution can be accounted for by just a mapping of @xmath42 with a shift due to the definition @xmath23 , and a smearing due to the trigger acceptance , @xmath43 ?",
    "another way of asking the question is : if the experimental statistics were high enough so that the trigger s @xmath1 range can be very narrow around @xmath44 , how much difference would there be between the ridge distribution in @xmath0 and the pseudorapidity distribution in @xmath1 ?    ) using @xmath1  from fig",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "2 with @xmath39 being adjusted to fit the height of the ridge distribution ; its value is @xmath45 .",
    "the peak in the data around @xmath46 is , of course , due to the jet component associated with the trigger jet and is not relevant to our comparison here .",
    "it is evident that the large @xmath0 distribution is well reproduced by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . in qualitative terms",
    "the width of the ridge distribution is due partly to the width of @xmath8 and partly to the smearing of @xmath40 , which adds another 1.5 to the width .",
    "no intrinsic dynamics of long - range longitudinal correlation has been put in .",
    "note that the center of the plateau in @xmath0 is at @xmath47 , which is the average of the shift due to @xmath40 being integrated from 0 to 1.5 .",
    "it suggests that if @xmath40 were fixed at @xmath48 when abundant data become available , then the width of @xmath49 would be only as wide as that of the single - particle @xmath8 .",
    "no theoretical prejudice has influence these observations .",
    "we now consider an interpretation of what eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) implies , given the empirical support for its validity from fig .  2 .",
    "since the observed ridge  integrates over trigger @xmath1 , we write it as = _ 0 ^ 1.5 d_1_h_2 dp_2 p_2 .",
    "r^h_2(_1,_2,p_2 ) |__2 = _ 1 + , [ 4 ] where we exhibit also explicitly the sum over the hadron type of the ridge particle @xmath50 and the integral over its momentum , denoted by @xmath51 . according to the definition of correlation @xmath52",

    "the jet component in the associated - particle  is excluded in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) .    on the other hand , with eq .  ( [ 1 ] ) substituted into eq .  ( [ 3 ] ) we have , using @xmath41 and @xmath51 instead of @xmath1 and @xmath27 , = _ 0 ^ 1.5 d_1_h_2 dp_2 p_2 .",
    "1^h_2(_2,p_2 ) |__2 = _ 1 + .",
    "[ 6 ] comparing eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) to ( [ 4 ] ) we see that the ridge  @xmath55 is to be related to the phenomenological quantity @xmath56 .",
    "thus the crux of the relationship between the ridge and inclusive s involves the interpretation of @xmath57 . to that end",
    "let us first write @xmath58 in the form _",
    "1^h_2(_2,p_2)=dn^h_2d_2p_2dp_2=h^h_2(_2,p_2 ) v(p_2 ) , [ 7 ] where @xmath59 is the transverse component that contains the explicit exponential behavior of @xmath51 .",
    "although @xmath60 has some mild @xmath51 dependence due mainly to mass effects of @xmath50 , the average transverse momentum @xmath61 is determined primarily by the inverse slope @xmath62 and is not dependent on @xmath41 .",
    "this is an approximate statement that is based on the brahms data @xcite , which show that @xmath63 is essentially independent of rapidity .",
    "since @xmath39 serves as the phenomenological bridge between @xmath64 and @xmath58 , the key question to address is : which of the two components , the longitudinal @xmath60 or the transverse @xmath65 , does the two - particle correlation exert its most important influence in relating @xmath64 to @xmath58 ?",
    "if there is longitudinal correlation from early times as in @xcite , then its effect must be to convert @xmath60 to @xmath55 . in that case",
    "@xmath65 is relegated to the secondary role due to radial flow ( which is , nevertheless , essential in explaining the @xmath6 restriction as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no intrinsic long - range longitudinal correlation , then @xmath60 is unaffected , and the ridge can only arise from the change in the transverse component , @xmath65 .",
    "without phenomenology one would think that the first option is more reasonable , when @xmath66 is regarded as large , and especially when there is an inclination based on theoretical ideas that there is long - range correlation . with the ridge phenomenology encapsuled in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) pointing to direct relevance of @xmath60 , the question becomes that of asking : @xmath67 is large compared to what ?",
    "if it is now recognized that @xmath67 is not large compared to the @xmath1 range of @xmath68 after the widening due to @xmath40 smearing ( remarked at the end of the previous section ) is taken into account , then the need for a long - range dynamical correlation to account for the structure of @xmath55 is lost .",
    "we describe below a possible explanation based on the second option of no long - range correlation .",
    "the key is to accept the suggestion of the data that the unmodified longitudinal component @xmath60 is sufficient .",
    "a series of articles have treated the subject of ridge formation in the recombination model @xcite , beginning with ( a ) the early observation of pedestal in jet correlation @xcite , to ( b ) its effects on azimuthal anisotropy of single - particle  at mid - rapidity @xcite , and then to ( c ) the dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath69 of the trigger relative to the reaction plane @xcite .",
    "forward productions in d - au and au - au collisions have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "our consideration here of ridge formation at @xmath70 is an extension of earlier studies with the common theme that ridges are formed as a consequence of energy loss by semihard or hard partons as they traverse the medium .",
    "the details involve careful treatment of the hadronization process with attention given to both the longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence has been studied thoroughly in @xcite , and the @xmath1 dependence should take into account of the experimental fact that the @xmath71 ratio can be large @xmath72 at large @xmath1 @xcite so that @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) can be properly reproduced , which is a subject to be reported elsewhere @xcite .    for our purpose here we need not repeat all the details , but state only that the effect of jets on the medium is that the energy loss enhances the thermal fluctuations of the soft partons in the early stage ( before hubble - like expansion takes place ) so that even at @xmath70 the transverse component @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) is sensitive to the thermal enhancement .",
    "the implementation of that basic physical idea on the formation of ridge particles ( called pedestal at the time ) was first carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of thermal - shower recombination for the trigger , and of thermal - thermal recombination for the associated particles .",
    "the result of the collective investigation @xcite can be summarized by r^h_2(_1,_2,p_2)=c h^h_2(_2,p_2 ) v_r(_1,_2,p_2 ) , [ 8 ] where v_r(_1,_2,p_2)= v_b+r(_1,_2,p_2)- v_b(p_2 ) , [ 9 ] which has the structure of eq .  (",
    "[ 5 ] ) , but only in the transverse part .",
    "the constant @xmath73 characterizes the magnitude of the ridge , which can depend on many factors that include the fluctuations in the initial configuration , the details of correlation dynamics , the experimental cuts , the @xmath6 interval where the ridge is formed and the related scheme of background subtraction .",
    "its value ( that was not calculated ) does not affect the relationship between the @xmath1 dependencies of the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "of more relevant concern to us are the transverse components , which may be written more explicitly as v_b(p_2)=(-p_2/t ) , v_b+r(_1,_2,p_2)=. [ 10 ] thus @xmath62 is the inverse slope of the inclusive thermal , regarded in eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) as the background , while @xmath74 represents the enhancement effect due to the semihard or hard parton .",
    "the parton s trajectory toward the near - side surface has a conical vicinity in which the medium has increased thermal activity because of the energy loss of the parton . in the initial configuration of spatial uncertainty in @xmath75",
    "we allow the right - moving soft partons to start from the left side of the thermally enhanced cone , and similarly the left - moving soft partons to start from the right side , so that the transverse  of the soft partons can change from @xmath62 to @xmath76 due to their passage through the enhanced cone .",
    "this is transverse broadening as in the conventional interpretation of the cronin effect @xcite but only for associated particles on the near side within a restricted region of @xmath6 around the trigger @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , the polar - angular relationship between the soft partons and the semihard parton can fluctuate significantly during the broadening process that affect both the longitudinal and transverse momenta of the associated particles .",
    "@xmath76 is a measure of the average effect on those particles .",
    "it should not depend significantly on @xmath0 , just as the cronin effect does not have sensitive dependence on the longitudinal momentum .",
    "thus we shall set @xmath78 to be roughly constant in @xmath0 to about the same degree of approximation as @xmath62 in @xmath65 is independent of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "to let @xmath76 be independent of @xmath0 is not equivalent to putting in by hand long - range longitudinal correlation ; that is analogous to the proposition in the flux - tube model that assuming similar radial flow for all parts of a tube of partons ( so that they all gain the same average @xmath79 ) does not imply that long - range longitudinal correlation is inserted by hand",
    ". there is , however , transverse correlation in the sense that the @xmath51 dependence of @xmath80 is the same at all @xmath41 .",
    "that is similar to the familiar phenomenon that rising tide raises all boats , where the boat heights are transverse to the spatial separation that is longitudinal , the former being correlated , the latter not .",
    "experimentally , for trigger momentum in the interval @xmath81 gev / c , it is found that @xmath82 is less than 20% of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "putting the various parts together , we have v_r(p_2 ) = e^-p_2/t(e^p_2/t-1 ) , = 1t-1t=ttt. [ 11 ] this expression was first obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite as a description of the ridge  without trigger .",
    "it was noted there that @xmath83 as @xmath84 , and that @xmath85 sets the scale for @xmath86 for @xmath87 gev / c in agreement with the data on elliptic flow .",
    "since the lower limit of the acceptance window for associated - particle momentum in the phobos experiment is low @xcite , the relevant values of @xmath62 and @xmath76 may not be the same as those measured by star @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of quantitative orientation they may be set at @xmath88 gev and @xmath89 gev , so that @xmath90 gev .",
    "the exact values are not important to our qualitative conclusion to be drawn below .",
    "we now substitute eq .",

    "[ 12 ] comparing this equation with eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , we come to the conclusion that @xmath39 is a phenomenological approximation of @xmath92 in the region where it contributes most to the integral over @xmath51 . by itself",
    "@xmath93 increases with @xmath51 as @xmath94 , but it is damped more severely by the exponential decrease of @xmath68 for @xmath95 gev / c , since @xmath96 .",
    "thus @xmath92 may be approximated by a constant @xmath39 in the region where the integrand is maximum at around @xmath97 gev / c . in so doing ,",
    "we obtain eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and therefore the phenomenological relation given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ 12 ] ) implies that there is transverse correlation , but no explicit longitudinal correlation beyond what is implicitly contained in @xmath58 . the transverse correlation that we refer to is not what one usually associates with the correlation between hadrons in the fragments of a high-@xmath79 jet .",
    "all of those fragments are in a small range of @xmath0 and have transverse - momentum fractions that are correlated .",
    "they populate the peak in fig .  2 . in our problem about the ridge we have been concerned with the transverse momentum of a particle associated with a trigger outside that peak .",
    "the former reveals the effect of the medium on the jet , while the latter reveals the effect of the jet on the medium .",
    "that is the basic difference between the jet and ridge components of the associated particles . since semihard or hard scattering takes place early",
    ", transverse broadening can take place for soft partons ( the medium ) moving through the interaction zone , leading to the ridge structure .",
    "an issue that this study has brought up is the usage of the word `` large '' in referring to the range of @xmath0 in the ridge structure . our phenomenological observation in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , substantiated by figs .  1 and 2 , does not reveal any quantitative definition of what large @xmath0 means . to say that @xmath70 is large is a figurative description until it is followed by a statement on dynamics . to be able to relate large @xmath0 to dynamical long - range correlation",
    "is a worthy theoretical endeavor , but more can be added to its phenomenological relevance if it can also elucidate the empirical connection between the two sides of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .    since the pseudorapidity  @xmath8 involves an integration over @xmath27 and sum over charged hadrons , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , a full understanding of its @xmath1 dependence must take into account the experimental fact from brahms that protons are produced more than twice as many as pions at @xmath98 and @xmath99 gev / c in central collisions @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) that the phobos data on @xmath8 at 0 - 6% centrality show a bump at @xmath100 , which is undoubtedly related to proton production .",
    "the widening of the @xmath1  is a hadronization problem that involves late - time physics .",

    "the two is a theoretical problem that remains to be done .",
    "most models emphasizes one or the other .",
    "equation ( [ 3 ] ) that connects @xmath49 to @xmath8 is an empirical statement without any direct revelation on the nature of the dynamics throughout all times of the collision process .",
    "it is therefore a worthy goal to explain that connection from all approaches .",
    "the approach that we have taken provides a possible solution involving no long - range longitudinal correlation in addition to what accounts for the single - particle  @xmath101 .",
    "since @xmath101 is an integral over the two - particle  @xmath102 , whatever intrinsic correlation that exists among the constituents must contribute to the properties of @xmath101 . in this paper",
