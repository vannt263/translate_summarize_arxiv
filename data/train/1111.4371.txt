    "the first author introduced @xmath0-differential posets in 1988 ( @xcite ) , as a class of ranked posets enjoying a number of important combinatorial and algebraic properties .",
    "the best known examples of differential posets are the _ young lattice _",
    "@xmath4 , and the _ fibonacci @xmath0-differential posets _ @xmath5 ; these latter are a generalization of the young - fibonacci lattice , which corresponds to the case @xmath6 .",
    "many authors have since provided interesting generalizations , in several directions , of the concept of a differential poset ; see @xcite .",
    "despite their relevance , a number of basic questions concerning these posets remain open .",
    "for instance , it is unknown what the structure of a differential poset @xmath7 can be , even in low rank ; it is still a conjecture that the rank function , @xmath2 , of @xmath7 must be _ strictly _ increasing ( that it _",
    "weakly _ increases was proved in @xcite , by means of a linear algebra argument ) ; and , no nontrivial lower bounds were known until now on the growth of @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a sharp upper bound ) .",
    "the object of this note is to start addressing some of the above or related structural questions , by also drawing some interesting , natural connections to other combinatorial areas .    the first part of our paper is devoted to proving a natural bijection relating differential posets to such other combinatorial objects as hypergraphs , steiner systems and finite projective planes .",
    "these latter are shown to be all naturally embedded in the first two ranks of some differential poset .",
    "it follows that a characterization of the initial portion of differential posets would already imply , for instance , a complete classification of finite projective planes , one of the major open questions in geometry . as a consequence of our correspondence",
    ", we establish the existence , if and only if @xmath1 , of @xmath0-differential posets with the same rank function but nonisomorphic in any two consecutive ranks , and we also show that the interval property  a ( still mostly conjectural ) property of interest in other areas of combinatorial algebra and combinatorics  in general fails for differential posets .    in the second part of the paper , we prove that , for any @xmath0-differential poset , its rank function @xmath2 has nonpolynomial growth .",
    "the conjectural lower bound for @xmath2 is given by the rank function @xmath8 of @xmath9 , the cartesian product of @xmath0 copies of the young lattice .",
    "this latter function , using the hardy - ramanujan asymptotic formula for the partition function @xmath10 , and some standard properties of the riemann zeta function , can be proved to be asymptotically equal to @xmath11 for suitable constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "our main result is that , for any arbitrary @xmath0-differential poset , @xmath3 for some constant @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 , this bound is close to being optimal , and in the much greater generality of arbitrary differential posets .",
    "we conclude our note by listing some of the main open questions on the rank function of a differential poset .",
    "we refer to @xcite for any unexplained terminology , and for the basic facts of the theories of posets and differential posets .",

    "therefore , @xmath51 can be identified with the 2-uniform hypergraph @xmath42 over @xmath46 where every cardinality two subset of @xmath46 is a hyperedge of @xmath42 . finally , following @xcite ,",

    "the _ interval property _ was first introduced by the second author @xcite in the context of combinatorial commutative algebra , where he conjectured its existence for the set of hilbert functions of level  and , in a suitably symmetric fashion , gorenstein  algebras ( we refer to @xcite for the relevant definitions ) .",
    "this property says that if two sequences , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , of a given class @xmath52 of integer sequences , coincide in all entries but one , say @xmath148 and @xmath149 for some index @xmath150 and some positive integer @xmath151 , then the sequence @xmath152 is also in @xmath52 , for each @xmath153    the interval property , which is still wide open for level and gorenstein algebras , has then also been conjectured in @xcite for other important sequences arising in combinatorics or combinatorial algebra , namely for pure @xmath154-sequences and for the @xmath155-vectors of pure simplicial complexes . as for pure @xmath154-sequences , in @xcite",

    "notice that the new hasse diagram thus constructed will be the hasse diagram of some differential poset up to rank three if and only if , for any element of rank two , the number of elements of rank three covering it is unchanged ( using axiom ( ii ) of definition [ diff ] ) , and two elements of rank two have some common cover if and only if they had some common cover in @xmath167 ( using axiom ( i ) ) .    how to perform this operation is described in figure 2 , where the first diagram is the portion of @xmath167 being removed , and the second diagram is its replacement .",

    "hence we have now obtained a new differential poset up to rank three , with rank function @xmath169 . by wagner s construction , this poset can be extended by one rank to a differential poset up to rank four , say @xmath47 , having rank function @xmath170 . if , similarly , we can now replace a portion of the hasse diagram of @xmath47 between ranks three and four and obtain a new differential poset up to rank four , say @xmath171 , having 3 fewer elements of rank four than @xmath47 , then we are done .",

    "our first key lemma is :    [ kappa ] for any @xmath0-differential poset @xmath7 and any nonnegative integer @xmath131 , @xmath191    among the closed hasse walks in @xmath7 enumerated by @xmath179 , it is easy to see that @xmath192 is the number of those walks starting at @xmath193 such that @xmath194 . otherwise , if @xmath195 , clearly @xmath196 is a common cover of @xmath197 and @xmath198 . similarly , from the uniqueness of the common cover , it follows that @xmath199 .",
    "therefore one moment s thought now gives that , in order to obtain @xmath179 , we need to add to @xmath200 a contribution of exactly @xmath201 which concludes the proof of the lemma .    the following lemma is also of independent interest , and appears to be new even for the young lattice ( so when @xmath6 and @xmath202 , the partition function ) .",
    "[ c2 ] for any @xmath0-differential poset @xmath7 with with rank function @xmath203 and any nonnegative integer @xmath131 , we have : @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the remainder of @xmath206 modulo 2 .",
    "we will make extensive use , in this proof , of the notation of @xcite .",
    "we begin by evaluating @xmath179 . by @xcite ,",
    "theorem 3.12 , we easily have that , if we set @xmath207 , then @xmath179 is the degree @xmath131 coefficient of @xmath208 , where @xmath209 and @xmath210    an equally standard computation gives that @xmath183 is the degree @xmath131 coefficient of @xmath211 in corollary 3.4 of @xcite . in the notation of that corollary ,",
    "the word @xmath212 is @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215    therefore , using the rational functions @xmath216 of @xcite , theorem 3.2 ( see page 930 for some explicit computations ) , @xmath217 can be written as : @xmath218    finally , by @xcite , theorem 3.2 , or by our equality ( [ alpha1 ] ) above , we have that @xmath219 is the degree @xmath131 coefficient of @xmath220 , where @xmath221    hence , employing lemma [ kappa ] and equations ( [ bf ] ) , ( [ aw ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) , we easily obtain that @xmath200 is the degree @xmath131 coefficient of :    @xmath222 @xmath223    notice that if @xmath224 as usual denotes the smallest integer @xmath225 , then we have : @xmath226@xmath227    thus , from ( [ fq ] ) , it follows that @xmath200 is @xmath228 times the degree @xmath131 coefficient of the right hand side of the last equation , plus @xmath229 times its degree @xmath230 coefficient , minus @xmath0 times its degree @xmath231 coefficient .",
    "therefore , @xmath232 which is a simple exercise to check that it coincides with the formula in the statement .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .    finally , we need an asymptotic estimate for @xmath233 , the number of chains in @xmath7 from rank 0 to rank @xmath131 .",
    "[ 0n ] for any fixed positive integer @xmath0 and any @xmath0-differential poset @xmath7 , we have : @xmath234    from the exponential generating function of @xcite , proposition 3.1 ( formula ( 12 ) ) , namely @xmath235 it is a standard task to determine estimates for @xmath236 , and in particular the desired asymptotic value for @xmath233 .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , example 3.2 , where the case @xmath6 is worked out in detail , using the saddle point method . )    given two functions @xmath237 , we say that @xmath238 if @xmath239 for @xmath131 large , for some positive constant @xmath12 ( i.e. , if @xmath240 ) .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath7 be any arbitrary @xmath0-differential poset with rank function @xmath203 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath14 such that @xmath241    for any @xmath189 , let @xmath242 be the number of maximal chains in @xmath7 ending at @xmath31 .",
    "hence , clearly , @xmath243 , and @xmath244    thus , from the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we obtain @xmath245    by @xcite , corollary 3.9 , we have that @xmath246 . also ,",
    "since by @xcite , corollary 4.3 , the @xmath247 are nondecreasing , lemma [ c2 ] yields the trivial estimate @xmath248    therefore , from ( [ ddd ] ) , ( [ cs ] ) and lemma [ 0n ] , we have @xmath249 and the theorem follows .",
    "we wrap up this note by gathering together a few open questions specifically on the rank function of a differential poset , some of which were previously posed in @xcite .",
    "as we saw in the last section , it is well known from @xcite , corollary 4.3 , that the rank function @xmath2 of any differential poset is _ weakly _ increasing .",
    "however , it is reasonable to conjecture that , in fact , strict inequality always holds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "define the _ first difference _ _ @xmath252 _ of a sequence _ @xmath253 _ as the sequence _",
    "recursively , define the _ @xmath255-th difference _",
    "@xmath256 as the first difference of the @xmath257-st difference . motivated by all examples we are aware of ( and the name itself of a differential poset ! ) ,",
    "more boldly we ask :    [ 2 ] ( i ) is it true that , for any @xmath0-differential poset with rank function _",
    "@xmath258 _ , _ @xmath259 _ in any `` rank '' @xmath260 ? + ( ii )",
    "is it true that , for any differential poset with rank function _",
    "@xmath258 _ and any integer @xmath255 , _",
    "@xmath261 _ in any `` rank '' @xmath131 large enough ( depending on @xmath255 ) ?",
    "notice that question [ 2 ] is known to have an affirmative answer for both the young lattice and the fibonacci @xmath0-differential posets . as for @xmath5 , both parts ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) are easy to check , and so is part ( i ) for @xmath4 . part ( ii ) for @xmath4",
    "was proved by h. gupta @xcite , in response to a problem raised by g. andrews ( see also a.m. odlyzko @xcite , for a sharper estimate using the rademacher convergent series expansion for @xmath178 ) . of course , for 1-differential posets , question [ 1 ] is equivalent to question [ 2 ] , part ( i ) .",
    "see also miller - reiner s @xcite , conjecture 2.3 , for a related conjecture .        answering a question posed in @xcite , p. byrnes @xcite recently proved that the rank function of any @xmath0-differential poset is bounded from above , rankwise , by that of @xmath5 , which satisfies the equality in question [ 22 ] for all @xmath131 .        for both questions [ 22 ] and [ 3 ] ,",
    "see part ( ii ) of remark [ alpha ] .",
    "note that , even though the asymptotic lower bound we have proved for @xmath2 in the previous section is close to being optimal , our approach does not appear to be of help in settling question [ 3 ] .    as we have seen , a characterization of all rank functions of differential posets seems entirely out of reach .",
    "thus , even though the interval property has been shown to fail in general in theorem [ ip ] , it would be helpful to recover it for some important families of differential posets , for it would at least imply a natural and very strong structural result on the set of their rank functions .",
    "for instance , we ask :      p. byrnes @xcite has computed the sequences that may occur as rank functions of 1-differential posets up to rank ten ( there are 44,606 nonisomorphic 1-differential posets up to rank nine , and 29,199,636 up to rank ten ) .",
    "such sequences suggest that , at least for the initial ranks , question [ 5 ] could very well have a positive answer .",
    "+   + * note added after acceptance . * by means of a nice algebraic argument",
    ", a. miller @xcite recently proved that question 4.1 has a positive answer ; that is , the rank function of any @xmath0-differential poset is _ strictly _ increasing , with the only exception @xmath263 when @xmath6 .",
    "it remains a very interesting ( and possibly consequential ) open problem to determine a combinatorial proof of this result .",
