    "shortly after the discovery of the neutron particle by chadwick ( 1932 ) , baade and zwicky ( 1934 ) made the seminal prediction that neutron stars are born in supernovae .",
    "very little was known about the manifestation of these objects until jocelyn bell and antony hewish discovered the first pulsating star with a period of 1.3 sec ( hewish et al .",
    "1968 ) , now known as psr b1919 + 21 . in the same year , the crab ( staelin & reifenstein 1968 , lovelace et al . 1968 ) and vela ( large et al . 1968 ) pulsars were discovered in their respective supernova remnants ( snrs ) confirming the 1934 prediction for the association of neutron stars with supernovae .    on the theoretical side , pacini ( 1967 ) , gold ( 1968 ) ,",
    "pacini & salvati ( 1973 ) , and rees & gunn ( 1974 ) introduced the theory that the emission from a neutron star is powered by its rotational energy loss , @xmath0=4@xmath1 ( with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the rotation period and its derivative ) , with the pulsar generating a magnetized particle wind whose ultra - relativistic electrons and positrons emit synchrotron radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "as this wind encounters its confining surrounding medium , it gets shocked forming a nebula referred to as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn , also known as @xmath4 ) .",
    "pwne , being the bubbles inflated by the spin - down energy of the pulsar , have proven to be excellent pathfinders for pulsar discovery . even in the absence of direct pulsar detection , their emission immediately implies the presence of a neutron star whose properties ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , characteristic age @xmath5=@xmath2/2@xmath3 , and dipole magnetic field",
    "@xmath6=3.2@xmath710@xmath8  @xmath9  g ) can be directly inferred from the properties of the pwn ( see gaensler & slane 2006 and kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 for reviews ) .    up to the early 1990s",
    "only a handful of neutron stars were known to be associated with snrs .",
    "the number of associations has however significantly increased with the synergy of radio and x - ray studies , particularly with the imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 missions in the 1990s , and since 2000 with the @xmath12 and _ xmm - newton _ missions .",
    "s coverage in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath13@xmath142  kev ) has been particularly instrumental in identifying pwne inside snrs , therefore revealing new pulsars following targeted radio and x - ray pulsation searches .",
    "s superb imaging resolution has opened a new window to image these fascinating objects through revealing high - resolution , arcsecond - scale , structures associated with the deposition of the pulsar s wind energy into its surroundings , and to pin down their powering engines .    currently out of the 309  known galactic snrs , 103 are associated with a neutron star or a neutron star candidate , with",
    "85 being identified as a pulsar .",
    "a pwn is detected or suggested in 87 cases , with 62 snrs associated with both a pwn and a neutron star or pulsar ( see ferrand & safi - harb 2012 and these proceedings ) .",
    "one of the major discoveries advanced in the past decade , thanks to the synergy of radio and x - ray observations , is the growing diversity of neutron stars .",
    "these include , in addition to the rotation - powered pulsars ( rpp ) like the crab , the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) dubbed as ` magnetars ' with surface dipole magnetic fields , @xmath6 , exceeding the quantum electrodynamic threshold @xmath15=4.4@xmath710@xmath16  g , the high - magnetic field radio pulsars ( hbps ) with magnetic fields intermediate between the crab - like pulsars and magnetars , the rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , and the central compact objects ( ccos ) inside snrs currently believed to be ` anti - magnetars ' ( see mereghetti 2008 , ng & kaspi 2011 , keane et al .",
    "2011 , and gotthelf & halpern 2008 , respectively , for reviews on these neutron star classes ) . among the 103 neutron star  snr associations , 10 snrs are associated with magnetars or magnetar candidates ( including 6 @xmath17 associations ) , 2 snrs are securely associated with hbps , 13 snrs are associated or proposed to be associated with ccos / cco candidates , with the remaining snrs associated with rpps or candidate neutron stars .    an outstanding question in this field is whether these apparently different classes of neutron stars are linked .",
    "it is now clear ( e.g. from the discovery of radio emission from a few magnetars , magnetar - like activity of the hbp j18460258 in the snr  kes  75 , and the existence of low - b magnetars like sgr  0418 + 5729 ) that the dipole magnetic field is not the sole factor determining their observational properties .",
    "one big unknown is their environment and progenitors ( see safi - harb & kumar , these proceedings ) . studies and/or searches for any associated pwne can help shed light on these questions and provide further clues on the nature of their emission mechanism and their confining environment .",
    "in fact , snr studies , conducted in parallel with neutron stars studies , have also revealed new classes of pwne with properties unlike the crab nebula long thought to be the prototype pwn .",
    "these include pwne expanding into bubbles blown by their progenitors , evolved objects powering x - ray nebulae that are offset from their radio counterparts , or compact x - ray pwne powered by pulsars with likely highly magnetized winds . coordinated targeted radio and x - ray studies of such unusual pwne are revealing pulsar candidates awaiting discovery , or interesting pulsars such as the highly energetic 24  ms pulsar recently discovered in the snr g76.9 + 1.0 ( arzoumanian et al .",
    "the diversity arising from such ` unusual ' and evolved pwne has been highlighted elsewhere ( safi - harb 2012 ) .",
    "in this paper , i review the growing evidence for pwne around the highly magnetized neutron stars and the clues they offer about their powering engines .",

    ", one generally needs a relativistic particle outflow in a strongly magnetized and confining medium .",
    "magnetars have been suggested to produce steady or post - outburst particle outflows ( e.g. harding et al .",
    "evidence for an intermittent outflow came with the discovery of a radio nebula around sgr  180620 following its 2004 december 27 giant flare ( gaensler et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it s not clear however whether steady magnetar outflows can power detectable pwne .",
    "their presence is of particular interest since they reflect the energy budget released over the pulsar s lifetime .",
    "in addition , their x - ray spectral properties shed light on whether they are rotation- or magnetically - powered , thus providing further clues to their possible link to the classical rpps .",
    "one of the challenges in identifying pwne around magnetars lies in the magnetars relatively high x - ray luminosity combined with heavy interstellar absorption causing the formation of a dust scattering halo around them .",
    "furthermore , typically the x - ray luminosity of the pwne associated with the rpps is only a small fraction of their spin - down energy ( @xmath18@xmath1910@xmath2010@xmath21@xmath0 ) . for magnetars ,",
    "the spin - down energy is very small , ranging from @xmath193@xmath710@xmath22  erg  s@xmath23 for sgr  0418 + 5729 to @xmath192@xmath710@xmath24  erg  s@xmath23 for 1e  1547.05408 , with typical values of @xmath1910@xmath25  erg  s@xmath23 .",
    "therefore , assuming a similarly small x - ray to spin - down luminosity ratio for steady pwne around magnetars , very deep high - resolution x - ray observations will be needed to identify any associated pwn .",

    "furthermore , a pwn has been suggested around axp 1e  1547.05408 ( vink & bamba 2009 ) , the largest spin - down luminosity magnetar ; however a more recent study showed that its emission is variable , correlated with the axp s flux , and dominated by dust scattering ( olausen et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "as shown in table  1 , these nebulae are compact and display a wide range of spectral indices and x - ray luminosities ( or ratios with respect to their pulsar s spin - down luminosity ) .",
    "the compact pwn surrounding psr  j11196127 is characterized by a hard power - law photon index ( noting the jet s photon index is also hard , @xmath26=1.4@xmath27 ) and a low x - ray to spin - down luminosity ratio , very similar to the properties of pwne associated with rpps ( safi - harb & kumar 2008 ) . to date , this pulsar hasnt shown evidence for a magnetar - like burst .",
    "psr  j18460258 , an hbp with spin properties similar to psr  j11196127 ( although younger and not yet detected as a radio pulsar ) , has shown evidence for magnetar - like behaviour and variability in the pwn properties ( gavriil et al .",
    "2008 , kumar & safi - harb 2008 , ng et al .",
    "this so far remains the only hbp that has shown ` schizophrenic ' behaviour ( i.e. rpp and magnetar - like ) suggesting that hbps can be powered by both rotational energy and magnetic field decay ( camilo 2008 ) .",
    "psr  j11196127 and psr  j18460258 are the only hbps known to date to be securely associated with snrs ( as expected from their youth ) .",
    "they are both characterized by a high @xmath0 and have a measured braking index yielding a more accurate estimate for their actual ages . for psr  j11196127 ,",
    "the recently refined braking index measurement using more than 12 years of radio timing data of @xmath28=2.684@xmath290.002 ( weltevrede et al .",
    "2011 ) implies an upper limit on its age of 1.9  kyr , smaller than the estimated age of 4.27.1  kyr for its associated snr , g292.20.5 ( kumar et al .",
    "this apparent age discrepancy can be attributed to a variable braking index for the pulsar , which has recently also shown some unusual timing characteristics at radio wavelengths .",
    "the photon index for the pwne associated with both above - mentioned hbps is relatively hard and consistent with that observed in the rpps pwne . for the rrat and the swift sources however , their pwne have a much steeper photon index , more similar to that observed in the ( soft ) power - law component of axps in the 0.510 kev band , suggesting a similar population of particles emitting in x - rays . the x - ray to spin - down luminosity of the three secure pwne ( excluding 1e 1547.05408 and with the exception of psr  j11196127 )",
    "is relatively large in comparison to the rpps .",
    "that , together with their relatively steep photon index and evidence of variability , @xmath30 that their x - ray luminosity is not entirely powered by rotation , but possibly by some additional source of magnetic energy .",
