    "these include :    * the relative influence of one part of the machine on another ( sections  [ sss : linkinggraph ] and [ sss : spectralgraph ] ) . * the number of nontrivial interactions contained in the machine ( section  [ sss : interactionnumber ] ) . * the number of independently functioning components ( _ factors _ ) of a machine ( section  [ s : complexity ] ) . * the maximal amount of information that a machine can contain ( section  [ sss : shannoncapacity ] ) .",
