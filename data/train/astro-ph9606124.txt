    "ngc 6181 is an isolated late - type giant spiral galaxy whose high surface brightness of gas emission and inclination of about @xmath5 are favorable for a detailed kinematical study .",
    "global parameters of the galaxy are listed in table 1 being taken basically from leda ( lyon - meudon extragalactic database ) .",
    "the first kinematical investigation of ngc 6181 was undertaken nearly 30 years ago by burbidge et al .",
    "they obtained three spectral long - slit cross - sections of the galaxy and found line - of - sight velocity distributions to be quite asymmetrical .",
    "they concluded that ngc 6181 is not an axisymmetric galaxy being intermediate between a barred and a normal spiral .",
    "the form of thin dust lanes in the center of ngc 6181 gave some support to this hypothesis .",
    "in addition , they noted that `` the structural center of the galaxy is not the center of the velocity distribution '' , because the systemic velocities determined from the outer and the inner parts of line - of - sight velocity curves disagreed .    our group ( afanasiev et al .",
    "1992 ) has repeated a long - slit kinematical study of ngc 6181 at the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ran ) and fully confirmed the unusual asymmetrical character of the one - dimensional line - of - sight velocity distributions .",
    "it has been proposed that it is the southern part of the galaxy which reveals strong non - circular gas motions up to distances of about 20  from the center .",
    "but it became evident that the obtaining of the two - dimensional velocity field is necessary to clarify the situation .",
    ".global parameters of ngc 6181 [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     direct images of ngc 6181 were obtained at the telescope zeiss1000 of sao ran .",
    "eleven frames of the galaxy have been derived with a ccd camera through the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 filters of johnson s system ( the log of the observations is given in table 3 ) .",
    "the seeing quality ranged from 2.1  ( @xmath8 images ) to 2.8  ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 images ) .",
    "gray - scaled sky - subtracted @xmath9 and @xmath6 images are presented in fig .",
    "2a and 2b ; flux - calibrated isophotes in @xmath6 ( 21.8 @xmath10 and 25.3 @xmath10 for the innermost and the outermost isophotes respectively with the step of 0.5 @xmath10 ) are shown in fig.2c .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 frames were calibrated by using 14 aperture photoelectric measurements of ngc 6181 from burstein et al .",
    "the range of aperture radii is from 16  to 48 .",
    "zero - point magnitudes are obtained with accuracy better than 0.01 mag , color terms are found to be negligible .",
    "the sky brightnesses are estimated as 21.26 @xmath10 in @xmath7 and 22.12 @xmath10 in @xmath6 ; these values coincide with mean sky brightnesses measured fifteen years ago in the special astrophysical observatory at @xmath11 by neizvestny ( 1981 ) .",
    "to check our @xmath12 calibration , we compared multi - aperture photoelectric data for ngc 6181 taken from the catalogue of longo & vaucouleurs ( 1983 , 1985 ) ( 18 entities excluding old data of pet-54 and big-51 ) with values simulated for the same apertures from our ccd frames . in fig . 3",
    "one can see a rather good consistency with the photoelectric data , even for large apertures .",
    "the calibration of @xmath8 and @xmath9 frames was indirect and less precise because standard stars were not observed",
    ". instead @xmath13 colors for five faint stars in the field of the galaxy were measured , and adopting them to be dwarfs we ascribe them mean @xmath14 and @xmath15 colors in accordance with their spectral types ( straizys 1977 ) .",
    "the formal accuracy of the calibration constants determined in such a way is 0.12 mag , but we admit a possible systematic shift of our @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes by up to 0.3 mag .",
    "a monochromatic image was constructed from the perot - fabry observational data in order to see the morphology of the inner part of ngc 6181 . the h@xmath0 map of the central part of ngc 6181 ( fig .",
    "1 ) reveals two bright central sources none of which coincides with the center of the isophotes in the continuum .",
    "two faint tails of h@xmath0 emission embrace the central continuum source which is located in the area of very weak emission .",
    "bearing in mind the absence of radio emission from the ngc 6181 nucleus , one may conclude that the nucleus of this galaxy is very quiescent .",
    "the direct images obtained with the 1 m telescope were used first of all to find the precise position of the center of the galaxy in the continuum .",
    "it was determined with respect to five nearby stars .",
    "location of the center was compared with the h@xmath0 distribution and with the dynamical center position ( see the next section ) .",
    "in addition we tried to derive some surface brightness distribution characteristics .",
    "fig.2 demonstrates rather smooth image in @xmath9 , with a weak bar - like disk elongation in the inner part , and a more clumpy image in @xmath6 ; prominent spiral arms extend up to the outermost radii in all passbands , confirming the grand - design classification of arms made by elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1984 ) .",
    "4 presents @xmath6 and @xmath7 azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles assuming @xmath16 ( line of nodes)=@xmath17 and inclination @xmath18 in accordance with the velocity field analysis ( see below ) .",
    "it shows that this galaxy possesses a very compact bulge which does not affect light distributions beyond the radius 7 . in the range 1225",
    "a brightness excess is noticeble over the simple exponential law extrapolated from the outer parts ; this excess is reproduced in all four filters being the largest ( 0.15 mag ) in the @xmath6 passband .",
    "it seems that the radius of 25  is a boundary between two disk subsystems .",
    "the disk scale measured in the range 2545  for all four passbands slightly decreases from blue to red ( fig .",
    "5 ) being in general accordance with earlier results of elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1984 ) and roth ( 1994 ) .",
    "the azimuthally averaged color tends to be bluer up to @xmath19 and then some reddening occurs , but the slopes of these trends are quite different for different colors ( fig . 6 and 7 ) . in fig .",
    "7 we try to compare radial color variations in ngc 6181 with models for old stellar populations showing pure metallicity trend ( worthey 1994 ) and with a mean observational sequence of galactic colors ( buta & williams 1995 ) , which is known to be defined mainly by different present - time star formation rate .",
    "color excesses expected due to interstellar reddening in the galaxy are also shown .",
    "the reddening in @xmath13 at @xmath20 has an azimuthally non - homogeneous character : it is a distinct , very red spot to the west from the nucleus obviously related to a local dust concentration ; the optical characteristics of the dust may be unusual because the spot is absent in @xmath14 and @xmath15 colors .",
    "the other color variations seem to be rather azimuthally homogeneous .",
    "comparison of the observed and the expected color trends shows that between the radii 7  and 25 , i. e. in the inner disk distinguished by some brightness excess , the observed color variations may be satisfactorily explained by variations of star formation intensity , because the point grid is roughly parallel to the observational sequence of integrated galactic colors .",
    "however the observed color variations in the outer disk are more complicated and rather unusual  especially for @xmath21 , where the reddening of @xmath13 and @xmath14 occurs under the constant @xmath15 .",
    "this looks quite inexplicable in the frames of simple effects which influence the color .",
    "the isophote form analysis ( pure - ellipse fitting ) was carried out to check a possible deviation from axial symmetry .",
    "the ellipticity between 1  and 7  from the center gradually increases from 0.10 ( bulge ) to 0.35  a behavior which is quite normal for a galaxy whose inclination is about @xmath5 .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath22 is presented in fig .",
    "we see an unambiguous turn of isophotes in the very center of ngc 6181 .",
    "measurements in all passbands show that at the radius of 23  the position angle of the major axis is @xmath23 with an uncertainty less than @xmath24 , which differs by @xmath25 from the orientation of the outermost isophotes ( @xmath26 , nilson 1973 ; @xmath27 , our measurement of the skyview isophote at the @xmath28 ) . in the radius range 1020  isophotes",
    "are also twisted by @xmath29 , but in the opposite sense with respect to the innermost region . only beyond @xmath30 , where the radial brightness distribution follows a pure exponential law , the isophote major axis becomes aligned with the line of nodes .",
    "fig . 9 presents the observed velocity field of ngc 6181 .",
    "it looks quite regular , with prominent signs of rotation .",
    "however in the center of the galaxy a twist of the zero - velocity line is seen which gives evidence for non - circular gas motions in this area in a good agreement with the photometrical data ( see below ) .",
    "a fit of the circular rotation model was made for the full velocity map , with dimensions of @xmath31 pixels ( @xmath32 ) , or within a radius of about 75(12.2 kpc ) from the center .",
    "special codes were written for data processing .",
    "the galactic disk was supposed to be thin and flat , that is it does not have any tilt of warp within the optical radius ; so , we looked for inclination @xmath33 and position angle of the line of nodes @xmath34 for the full radius range .",
    "as a first step , we determined the position of the dynamical center and a systemic velocity suggesting a central symmetry of the velocity field .",
    "the dynamical center appears to coincide with the center of broadband isophotes with an accuracy of one pixel .",
    "the systemic velocity is found to be 2375 @xmath2 which agrees with earlier determinations ( table 1 ) .",
    "the dispersion of systemic velocity values determined over all pairs of symmetrically taken points of the galaxy is 16 @xmath2 which is close to our accuracy of individual velocity determinations .",
    "then we verified if the whole line - of - sight velocity field can be fitted by a pure circular rotation .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity residuals ( r.m.s . ) were calculated for @xmath4 ranges of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; the minimum of the velocity residual calculated over the total velocity field reveals the true values of these parameters .",
    "this approach assumes that any velocity field distortions , if they exist , are of local nature .    the agreement is found the best for the following orientation parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the @xmath34 being more strictly limited and @xmath37 having less accuracy .",
    "if one compares these values with the photometric parameters of ngc 6181  for example , @xmath38 ( bottinelli et al . 1984 ) and @xmath39 ( nilson 1973 ) or with the data from the table 1 ",
    "it becomes clear that the bulk of the gas in the galaxy rotates circularly .",
    "10 presents the azimuthally averaged rotation curve .",
    "for @xmath40 it is nicely flat at the level of 210 @xmath2 with an r.m.s .",
    "error of individual points not worse than 5 - 7 @xmath2 .",
    "the maximal rotation velocity estimated from the width of the hi line at 21 cm , @xmath41 , is 222 @xmath2 ( leda consultation ) , so our rotation curve for ngc 6181 is in accordance with previously known data .    despite the generally good accordance between the observed velocity field and the circular rotation model ,",
    "there are three ranges of radial distances where essential systemic deviations from a pure circular rotation are detected with the regions of maximal deviations at @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the first area is located near to the dynamical major axis and coincides neither with spiral arms nor with bright hii regions . however , the color profiles discussed in the previous section demonstrate a turnover of color radial trends at this radius . in the southern half of the galaxy this region",
    "is distinguished by the excess of azimuthal velocity of order of 3050 @xmath2 , and in the northern half of the galaxy there is a similar velocity depression of about the same value .",
    "as these two areas are located symmetrically with respect to the galactic center , this anomaly may be considered rather as a kind of regular wave distortion of the velocity field than as a local velocity anomaly .",
    "the model velocity field calculated in the frame of pure circular rotation with the parameters mentioned above has been subtracted from the observed velocity field .",
    "the central part of the residual velocity field is presented in fig .",
    "here we see two halves of the ring - like region where deviations from circular rotation model locally exceed 50 @xmath2 .",
    "being deprojected onto the plane of the galaxy , this region looks like three quarters of a perfect circular ring with a mean radius of 11  ( about 1.8 kpc ) ; the eastern half of the ring has positive residual velocities up to 55 @xmath2 , the western part has negative ones , from 30 to 40 @xmath2 .",
    "the width of the ring is at least 5 pixels , which corresponds to 0.8 kpc .",
    "the fact that the switching of residual velocity sign takes place near the line of nodes implies that the residual velocities here are mostly radial ones ( here and below , we admit that the gas motion is in the plane of the disk ) .",
    "together with a circular deprojected shape of the ring , it also gives evidences that the line of nodes of this structure is close to the @xmath34 of the global galactic disk and that the ring lies exactly in the galactic plane being purely an internal feature of the galactic gaseous subsystem .",
    "stemming from the slightly asymmetric minor - axis surface brightness profile of the bulge one may conclude that the western half of the galactic disk is the nearest one to us . in this case",
    "we may conclude that ngc 6181 possesses a trailing spiral pattern and radially expanding gas motions in the ring .",
    "it is worth noting that the ring of radially moving gas lies closer to the center than the beginning of the well - defined spiral arms and does not reveal itself in a brightness distribution .",
    "nevertheless ionized gas in the ring shows systemic velocity residuals of much higher amplitude than in the bright spiral arms .    in the very center of ngc 6181 , within the region",
    "where the major axis of continuum isophotes is twisted ( @xmath45 ) , a clear sign of elliptical gas rotation is seen in the two - dimensional velocity field .",
    "analysing an azimuthal dependence of central velocity gradient , we find that the maximum of the cosine curve computed by the least square approximation + dv@xmath46/dr = [ 44.2 cos(@xmath47 ",
    "325.5@xmath48 )  4.7 ] @xmath49 + is shifted by about @xmath4 relative to the line of nodes @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "hence , circumnuclear gas rotation in ngc 6181 parallel with the isophote major axis twist gives strong evidence for the presence of a small bar in the very center of the galaxy .",
    "so ngc 6181 may be applied to a small number of known galaxies where nuclear bar reveals itself both from photometric and kinematic data",
    ".    a physical connection between the central mini - bar and the ring - like zone of gas expansion may be suspected .",
    "it follows from radial velocities of gas in the ring deprojected onto the plane of the galaxy , assuming that these motions are purely radial .",
    "parameters of the galactic plane orientation used for deprojection were taken from the best fit model of circular rotation : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it appeared that the radial velocity of the ring expansion varies along the eastern half of the ring from 50 to 120 @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "13 ) , and the position angle of the maximum expansion velocity roughly coincides with the position angle of the minimum of cosine curve describing the azimuthal dependence of the central velocity gradient .",
    "it gives some evidence that the position angle of the largest radial velocities is related to the orientation of nuclear bar .",
    "kinematically distinct , ring - like inner regions of systemic radial motions of gas , similar to what we observe in ngc 6181 , were not known yet .",
    "the only analogy , which can be mentioned , is the famous `` 3 kpc arm '' in our galaxy : it possesses radial velocities of about 100150 @xmath2 and is probably connected with a triaxial structure of the galactic center .",
    "the other radially expanding gaseous ring , found in ngc 4725 ( buta 1988 ) , has a radius of 1013 kpc being a structure of a quite different scale .",
    "note , that morphologically distinguished nuclear rings , which reveal themselves as zones of brightness , not of velocity , excess , often accompany nuclear bars ( buta & crocker 1993 ) .",
    "numerical simulations confirm that gaseous subsystems may give ring - like response to a triaxial potential form ( combes & gerin 1985 ) .",
    "so what we found may be considered as a kinematical counterpart of such structures as nuclear rings , related to general disk structure . in this case , as in the case of our galaxy , it is not necessary to interpret radial gas velocities in the ring - like zone as an evidence of its real expansion due to some explosion event : there is no hint of the presence of a shock front or enhanced star formation in front of the ring or in the ring itself .",
    "a more realistic explanation is that we observe here an unusually large amplitude of hydrodynamical oscillations of gas velocities associated with the density waves which penetrate deep into the inner part of the disk ( fridman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the other feature of the velocity field of ngc 6181 is a multicomponent structure of emission line profiles in some hii regions of the disk .",
    "we performed gauss analysis of two - component emission line profiles for the central part of the galaxy @xmath50 pixels , or @xmath51 . the primary  more strong and everywhere narrow ",
    "component reveals a velocity field which excellently agrees with the field obtained in the previous analysis : a general circular rotation , elliptical gas motions in the center and ring - like zone of radial gas motions .",
    "the secondary , more weak and broad component ( with gas velocity dispersion up to 200 @xmath2 ) appears only in the four brightest hii regions ; it is absolutely absent in the ring - like zone of the radial gas motions .",
    "the difference between the `` first '' and the `` second '' velocity component averaged over the total region of the galaxy is zero , but for the bright hii region , nearest to the dynamical center , there exists a switch of velocity difference sign between the northern and the southern halves .",
    "it allows to suspect that we deal with a proper rotation of a giant star formation site .",
    "measurements of the line - of - sight velocity field for gas emission in the giant sc galaxy ngc 6181 have allowed us to reveal some rare phenomena .",
    "the most unusual of them is the presence of a ring - like region with striking systemic deviations from the general circular rotation which may be interpreted as a strong gas radial motion .",
    "more elaborate interpretation which connects this motion with the presence of hydrodynamical 3d oscillations of gas velocities related to density wave phenomena will be given elsewhere ( fridman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a small nuclear bar is also found in the galaxy both by kinematic and photometric methods .",
