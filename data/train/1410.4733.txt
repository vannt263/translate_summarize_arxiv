    "models and materials with reduced dimensionality typically show enhanced correlation effects _ beyond _ the limit of standard density - functional or perturbation theory - based schemes , calling for corresponding developments of theoretical tools . from a general point of view",
    ", the challenge for a theoretical description is much bigger than in bulk systems : in three dimensions ( 3d ) , even in the presence of strong electronic correlations , very accurate material calculations can be performed by means of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite combined with _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "methods.@xcite this is possible , because dmft captures , non - perturbatively , the purely _ local _ part of electronic correlations , which drives most important phenomena of correlated electrons in the bulk , such as , e.g. , the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mit).@xcite formally , dmft becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions@xcite where all non - local correlations in space are averaged out .",
    "corrections to dmft in finite - dimensional systems originate from non - local correlations . while in 3d deviations from the dmft description",
    "become predominant only in specific parameter regimes,@xcite e.g. , in the proximity of a second order phase transition,@xcite the situation is completely different in case of lower dimensions .",
    "in fact , reducing the dimensionality magnifies effects of _ non - local _ correlations , undermining the main assumption of dmft .",
    "already for extended 2d systems , the physics deviates qualitatively from the dmft predictions , e.g. , the mott - hubbard mit is found to disappear in a weak - coupling crossover in the phase - diagram of the 2d hubbard model.@xcite evidently , even stronger non - local effects can be expected if the dimensionality is further reduced towards 1d or 0d .    as for the theoretical description of electronic correlations at the nanoscale ,",
    "several algorithmic implementations based on dmft have recently been implemented under the name of nano or real - space dmft.@xcite despite some technical differences , all these algorithms essentially extend the dmft scheme to finite - size and possibly non - translational invariant systems .",
    "the common idea consists in solving simultaneously several single impurity problems for calculating , separately , the local self - energies of the different sites composing the system of interest , while the dmft self - consistency is then enforced at the level of the whole nanostructure .",
    "this way , a number of interesting results have been obtained both for model@xcite and realistic studies.@xcite however , the applicability of these dmft - based methods is restricted to the weakly correlated and/or the high - temperature regime , where the effects of non - local correlations are weaker@xcite and can be , to a certain extent , neglected .",
    "such limitations were also openly discussed in the previous literature,@xcite where numerical comparisons between dmft - based calculations and exact solutions ( where available ) have shown large deviations already in the intermediate coupling regime .    a promising theoretical answer to this challenging situation",
    "has already been proposed , but not implemented , in ref .",
    ": the application of diagrammatic extensions@xcite of dmft such as the dynamical vertex approximation ( d@xmath0a)@xcite for nanoscopic systems ( nano - d@xmath0a ) .",
    "the basic idea of d@xmath0a is the following : instead of assuming the locality of the one - particle self - energy [ @xmath1 , as in dmft , one raises the assumption of the locality to a _ higher _ level of the diagrammatics , i.e. , from the one- to the two - particle irreducible vertex ( @xmath2)@xcite once local vertex functions are computed , e.g. , with the same impurity solvers used for the standard dmft,@xcite non - local correlation effects can be directly included through diagrammatic relations , e.g. , in the most general case , through the parquet equations.@xcite    in the specific case of the d@xmath0a implementation for nanoscopic systems,@xcite the nano - d@xmath0a algorithm requires a separate calculation of the local irreducible vertex function for each inequivalent site of the nanostructure .",
    "the inclusion of the non - local effects should be performed at the level of the whole nanostructure via a self - consistent solution of the parquet equations .",
    "this procedure is less demanding than the exact treatment of the corresponding quantum hamiltonian : the exponential scaling with the number of sites required for a diagonalization of the hamiltonian , is replaced by a polynomial effort to solve the parquet equations .",
    "moreover , the necessity of calculating the vertex functions only locally , mitigates secondary ( but important ) numerical problems such as the sign - problem in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) solvers .",
    "nonetheless , the overall numerical efforts for treating the parquet equations has limited , so far , a wide application of d@xmath0a - based methods in their more complete ( parquet - based ) form : hitherto , all successful applications of d@xmath0a to 2d and 3d systems have been performed in cases where fluctuations in a given scattering channel predominate.@xcite in this case the solution of the parquet equation can be replaced by a much simpler ladder resummation performed in the most relevant channel only.@xcite we note , in passing , that such considerations apply , with very few exceptions,@xcite also to almost all other diagrammatic extensions of dmft . for similar reasons , no application of the nano - d@xmath0a algorithm , as illustrated in refs . and has been realized hitherto .",
    "exploiting the constant improvements of the numerical performance both in the dmft calculations of vertex functions,@xcite as well as in the numerical solution of the parquet equations,@xcite we will present here our first results of the full ( i.e. , parquet - based ) nano - d@xmath0a , applied to a set of correlated nanoscopic rings of increasing size .",
    "the importance of the results presented in the following is twofold , and goes beyond the demonstration of a full applicability of the algorithm proposed in ref .  :",
    "physically , our calculations allow to understand the interplay of local and non - local correlations in spectral and transport properties of finite systems of different sizes ; from a methodological perspective , the application of a full ( parquet - based ) d@xmath0a scheme to these nanoscopic systems represent one of the most severe benchmarks conceivable for this theoretical approach .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of a d@xmath0a calculation depends on the correctness of the locality assumption for the two - particle irreducible vertex functions .",
    "heuristically , this assumption looks plausible for 3d and 2d systems with local interactions , where strong spin , charge , and pair fluctuations are already generated by the corresponding collective modes built on local irreducible vertices .",
    "numerically , a direct verification of the d@xmath0a assumption is difficult in 2d or 3d : while the irreducible vertex surely displays a strong frequency dependence,@xcite taken into account by the d@xmath0a , its independence on momentum has been shown explicitly only in few calculations@xcite beyond dmft , where the momentum - dependence was found to be weak . in this work ,",
    "we focus instead on systems where an exact numerical solution is available , so that both , the d@xmath0a performances and assumptions , can be tested .",
    "let us emphasize that the low connectivity and the peculiarity of 1d physics represent the most challenging situation for d@xmath0a .",
    "in this perspective , our numerical analysis will also allow to draw conclusions , on a more quantitative ground , on the physical content of parquet - based approximations .",

    "we recall that the idea of d@xmath0a is to apply the locality assumption of dmft at an higher level of the diagrammatics : while in dmft all one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) one - particle diagrams ( i.e. , the self - energy @xmath24 ) are assumed to be purely local , d@xmath0a confines the locality to the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) two - particle diagrams , i.e. , the fully irreducible vertex @xmath25 is approximated by all local feynman diagrams.@xcite hence , in the d@xmath0a framework , the purely local , but frequency - dependent,@xcite 2pi vertex @xmath26 is calculated for a site @xmath11 and then used as the input for the parquet equations . in practice , this vertex is obtained by solving the anderson impurity model ( aim ) numerically . hence , non - local correlations on top of the dmft solution are generated in _ all _ scattering channels by the ( numerical ) solution of the parquet equations,@xcite without any restriction to specific ( ladder ) subsets of diagrams.@xcite for the sake of clarity , we should emphasize here that this is different from the so - called parquet approximation ( pa ) .",

    "the numerical solution of the aim yields the local green s function @xmath30 and the local dmft self - energy @xmath31 . through the dyson equation",
    "the local ( yet site - dependent ) dmft self - energies determine the new non - local green s function @xmath32 , and the self - consistency is realized at the level of the whole nanostructure .",

    "a deeper understanding of the above results can be obtained by the analysis of the frequency and momentum structure of the 2pi vertex .",

    "such a large frequency and momentum dependence of the exact 2pi vertex can be possibly interpreted in terms of a proximity to a non - perturbative instability of the bethe - salpeter equations , such as those already reported for the hubbard and falikov - kimball models.@xcite the strong momentum dependence of the fully irreducible vertex is certainly one of the reasons of the failure of the present d@xmath0a calculation to open a spectral gap at the fermi level of the @xmath87 sites ring . however , an important piece of information is also enclosed in the exact local vertex @xmath108 . as shown in fig .",

    "this unexpected result is likely to be attributed to the ability of the moriyasque corrections to mimic the self - consistency of the local ( irreducible ) vertex.@xcite this suggests that also the full parquet d@xmath0a might be able to reproduce the divergent trend of the self - energy at the fermi surface with a better starting point for the local fully irreducible vertex than the one provided by dmft .",
    "this would definitely be achieved by performing fully self - consistent d@xmath0a calculations .",

    "several tests in this case ruled out the possibility that the non - analyticity of the self - energy is a physical artefact due to numerics ( e.g. , due to the finite frequency mesh ) .",
    "+ by exploiting the ( hitherto ) unique possibility of having at disposal both ladder- and parquet d@xmath0a self - energy and vertex results , we have performed a decomposition of the d@xmath0a self - energy , by separating the contributions coming from the different channels , following a similar `` philosophy '' as in the recently introduced _",

    "in fact , as shown in fig .  [",

    "this means that the error introduced by ladder assumptions might become even larger than the value of @xmath120 itself , which is often strongly reduced by non - local correlation far from the fermi surface .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the overall trend of a strong reduction of @xmath121 due to non - local correlation , which is also visible in the exact results , is correctly captured even by the ladder d@xmath0a calculations .",

    "for instance , in the parameter regime considered for the @xmath88 sites ring , causality is preserved . as the particle - hole channel is dominant in the vicinity of the fermi level , neglecting the particle - particle channel is justified for this ( most relevant ) part of the dbz , and the ladder approximation can still be employed .",
    "in this paper we have presented a numerical study of correlated hubbard nano - rings , employing the parquet d@xmath0a .",
    "this algorithm corresponds to the actual realization of the original d@xmath0a idea , in which the local ( dmft ) assumption is made _ only _ at the level of the 2pi local vertex of the theory , while non - local correlations beyond dmft are computed simultaneously in _ all _ channels by solving the corresponding parquet equations .",
    "this represents a methodological improvement over the ladder d@xmath0a algorithms used hitherto , where additional approximations ( e.g. , restriction to a given subset of ladder diagrams ) were performed .",
    "the overall numerical effort of a full d@xmath0a calculation is clearly larger than in the case of ladder approximations , but the numerical workload is still manageable in 1d and 2d.@xcite    specifically , we have shown results for correlated hubbard rings of different sizes @xmath118 , and performed a systematic comparison of the parquet d@xmath0a against dmft , pa , ladder d@xmath0a and the exact qmc solution of the problem .",
