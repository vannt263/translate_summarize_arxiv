    "this field causes protons to penetrate even deeper into the barrier and to generate even stronger electric field . at @xmath169 , at some distance from the barrier front the electric field inside the collision region is stronger than the magnetic field , and the barrier can not suppress penetration of protons inside itself .",

    "the acceleration of outflowing electrons is completely due to nonstationarity of electromagnetic fields which are induced inside and near the barrier during the beam  barrier interaction .",

    "the bunching of reversed protons is a key element of nonstationarity of the beam  barrier collision .",
    "roughly , the process of bunch formation may be illustrated in the following way . the first protons , which are entered into the barrier from @xmath17 to @xmath172 , run along almost semi - circle trajectory in almost unperturbed field of the magnetic barrier .",
    "for the same lorentz - factor , the gyroradius of electrons is much smaller than the gyroradius of protons .",

    "in case of large @xmath3 , the velocities , @xmath174 , of reversed protons in the @xmath175 direction are quite different ( see fig .",
    "[ protangl ] ) so that the bunches will decay at some distance from the barrier .",

    "the propagation of plasma beams across a magnetic field is one of the oldest problems in plasma physics . in spite of the long history of investigation ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a clear model of this phenomenon has yet to emerge .",
    "however , some general conclusions about the beam  magnetic field interaction were done many years ago .",
    "for example , if the plasma flow pressure is more than the magnetic field pressure , it is possible for the plasma to cross the field by purely magnetohydrodynamic principles .",
    "this propagation mode is equivalent to the motion of a solid conductor across the field . during propagation",
    ", the plasma beam picks up and carries along the ambient plasma and magnetic field .",
    "such models of the beam propagation into the magnetic field are based on the diamagnetic properties of the plasma .",
    "most probably , in our time - dependent simulations we observed such a propagation mode .",
    "physically , the pushing of the magnetic field is provided by strong transverse electric currents ( @xmath176 ) in the domain @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the @xmath19 coordinate of the most deeply penetrated particle .",
    "if @xmath3 is large enough , @xmath179 , this current layer screens strongly the external magnetic field of the barrier at @xmath180 , and moves deeper and deeper into the barrier . from our time - dependent simulations , we have @xmath86 .",
    "this is more or less consistent with the conclusion that there are no stationary solutions for the beam ",

    ".    many important features of our nonstationary solutions are absent in a stationary one .",
    "they are energy transfer from incoming protons to outgoing electrons , bunching of outgoing protons , excitation of low - frequency electromagnetic waves , etc .",
    "the main question which remains open untill now is what the final state of the beam  barrier system in a very long - time run , @xmath182 , is .",
    "as noted , we did not observe any decay of non - stationarity of the beam  barrier interaction , even in simulations extended up to @xmath183 .",
    "however , it is possible that at @xmath184 our nonstationary solution tends to a stationary one .",
    "it is worth noting that a stationary solution of the beam  barrier collision might be unstable if @xmath3 is high enough .",
    "indeed , the energy of electrons inside the barrier may be a few hundred times higher than their initial energy . in this case",
    ", small ( @xmath185 ) perturbations might result in that some part of reversed , @xmath186 , electrons is stopped and captured inside the barrier before reaching the barrier front . besides",
    ", electrons may be captured by the barrier because of their energy losses via synchrotron emission in electric and magnetic fields if these fields are strong enough . in turn",
    ", such a capture of electrons may result in complete destruction of the stationary solution .",
    "barrier collision is similar , in many respects , to collisionless shocks .",
    "such shocks in astrophysical settings can and do accelerate charged particles to high energies ( see , for a review , refs .",
    "the efficiency of particle acceleration by shocks may be as high as @xmath187 % ( e.g. , ref .",
    "this value is more or less the same as the fraction of the kinetic energy of the beam which may be transferred to high - energy electrons in the process of the beam ",
    "barrier collision .",
    "besides of analytical calculations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , acceleration of particles by shocks was studied numerically in both test particle monte carlo simulations ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and self - consistent plasma simulations ( e.g. , refs .",
    "most current self - consistent simulations of plasma shocks used in astrophysics are of the hybrid type because the @xmath188 ratio is small , @xmath189 . in the hybrid approach , the ions are treated kinetically using standard particle - in - cell techniques , while the electrons are treated as a massless , charge neutralizing fluid . in our simulations",
    "we did not use the hybrid approach because the case of ultrarelativistic beam is , in some respects , easy than non - relativistic case .",
    "this is because in our case , @xmath0 , electrons are accelerated fast , and the mean energy becomes only an order of magnitude smaller than the mean energy of protons . in this case , the ratio of the gyroradii of electrons and protons is about two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath188 that is the ratio of the gyroradii of electrons and protons in non - relativistic plasma .",
    "this allowed us to treat both electrons and protons kinetically .",
    "the configuration considered in our simulations is not quite self - consistent .",
    "indeed , the barrier magnetic field has to be generated by some kind of current flowing in the plane @xmath138 in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "however , the evolution of this current because of its interaction with the induced electromagnetic fields was not studied . in laboratory experiments ,",
    "an external current flowing along a sheet of thin wires can be the barrier - front current .",
    "as to a situation which is relevant for astrophysics , the barrier fields has to be generated by the magnetized plasma of the barrier .",
    "numerical considerations of such a configuration are under way .",
    "there are at least two kinds of astrophysical objects to which the results of our simulations may be applied .",
    "they are the sources of @xmath11-ray bursts and strongly collimated jets of active galactic nuclei .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are brief , @xmath190 s , bursts of high - energy radiation that appear at random in the sky , emitting the bulk of their energy in the range from @xmath191 mev to a few mev ( for a review of observational data on @xmath11-ray bursts see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . during their appearance",
    ", they often outshine all other sources in the @xmath11-ray sky combined .",
    "more than two decades have passed since the discovery of @xmath11-ray bursts , but their origin is still a mystery .",
    "the observed isotropy of @xmath11-ray bursts in the sky and deficiency of faint bursts strongly suggest @xcite that they are cosmological in origin @xcite .",
    "a cosmological origin of @xmath11-ray bursters implies that the typical energy output in both hard x - rays and @xmath11-rays is about a few @xmath192 ergs , that is , about @xmath193 .",
    "such high energetics of @xmath11-ray bursters and a short time scale of @xmath11-ray flux variability call for very compact objects as a source of @xmath11-ray bursts .",
    "these objects may be either fast - rotating neutron stars which arose from accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs in binaries @xcite or differentially rotating disk - like objects which are formed by the merger of a binary consisting of two neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field @xmath194 at the surface of these objects may be up to @xmath195 g @xcite .",
    "a common point of all acceptable models of @xmath11-ray bursters is that a relativistic , @xmath196 , wind is a source of their radiation ( e.g. , refs .",
    "otherwise , high - energy photons are absorbed by @xmath197 , and both observed durations of @xmath11-ray bursts and their hard energy spectra , often with a very high energy tail extending up to hundreds of mev , can not be explained .",
    "most probably , the radiation of @xmath11-ray bursts is produced in the process of interaction between such a wind and an external medium @xcite .",
    "for both the post - merger objects and fast - rotating neutron stars , the total energy of the outflowing gas can not be more than @xmath198 ergs .",
    "therefore , to explain the energetics of cosmological @xmath11-ray bursters it is needed that not less than a few per cent of the wind energy is transformed into high - frequency radiation .    from our simulations of the beam ",
    "magnetic barrier collision it follows that the energy which is lost by a relativistic magnetized wind in the process of its interaction with an external medium is distributed in the following way : about half of this energy is in ultra - relativistic protons which are reflected from the wind front .",
    "the mean energy of reflected protons in the frame of the burster is @xmath199 .",
    "the other half of the wind energy losses is distributed more or less evenly between low - frequency oscillations of electromagnetic fields , and both high - energy electrons and their high - frequency radiation .",
    "the low - frequency electromagnetic oscillations which are generated near the wind front can accelerate electrons to very high energies and decay at some distances from the front @xcite . as a result of these",
    ", the fraction of the kinetic energy of relativistic magnetized winds which is transferred to high - energy electrons and then to high - frequency emission might be , in principle , as high as @xmath200 .",
    "this is more than enough to explain the energetics of @xmath11-ray bursters .    in the burster frame ,",
    "the characteristic energy , @xmath201 , of photons which are generated by accelerated electrons in the vicinity of the wind front is @xmath202 times higher than the value of @xmath203 ( see eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) ) in the frame of the outflowing gas because of the doppler effect , @xmath204 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath8 has to be more than @xmath205 @xcite , from eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) we can see that the radiation which is generated near the wind front with a high enough efficiency , @xmath206 , has the characteristic energy @xmath207 mev , while the main part of emission of detected bursts is in the range from a few @xmath208 kev to a few mev . in other words ,",
    "the radiation from the front vicinity is either too hard or too weak to explain the bulk of the burst emission .",
    "the @xmath11-ray emission which is generated near the wind front may be responsible for the high energy @xmath11-rays , @xmath209 a few ten mev , which are observed in the spectra of some bursts @xcite .",
    "the bulk of emission from @xmath11-ray bursters may be explain by the synchrotron radiation of high - energy electrons which are ejected from the wind front ahead of the front .",
    "indeed , electromagnetic fields ahead of the wind front are the fields of low - frequency electromagnetic waves which are generated near the wind front due to non - stationarity of the wind  external medium interaction . in this case",
    ", the mean value of the magnetic field is about @xmath210 .",
    "the mean energy of high - energy electrons reflected from the wind front is @xmath211 times smaller than the mean energy of radiating electrons which are responsible for the generation of @xmath11-rays near the front .",
    "therefore , the characteristic energy of synchrotron photons which are generated far ahead of the wind front is about hundred times smaller than the characteristic energy , @xmath212 , of photons from the front vicinity .",
    "this energy is of the order of characteristic energy of @xmath11-ray burst emission .      at radio frequencies , where vlbi can resolve the emission regions at the milliarcsecond scale , many of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) exhibit compact jets ( e.g. , ref .",
    "these jets are remarkably well collimated , with opening angles typically less than a few degrees .",
    "the lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma is @xmath213 .",
    "recently , the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) has detected @xcite a few ten extragalactic sources , which are thought to be radio galaxies favorably oriented so that the axes of the radio jets are nearly aligned in our observing direction ( e.g. , ref .",
    "the main part of the @xmath11-ray emission from the egret sources is in the range from a few ten mev to a few gev . besides ,",
    "very hard @xmath11-rays at tev energies were detected from mrk 421 with the ground - based whipple telescope @xcite .",
    "hence , particles are accelerated in the jets of agns at least up to the energies of @xmath214 ev .",
    "if the jet of agn is free ( confined solely by its own inertia ) , it resembles a conic section of a spherical wind . in this case , the components of the magnetic field parallel and transverse to the jet velocity are @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively , where @xmath217 is the distance from the central engine which is responsible for the agn activity .",
    "therefore , at large distances from the engine the field of the jet is mainly across its velocity , @xmath218 , and our simulations may be applied to decribe the interaction between the jet front and an external medium . as it is shown above , in the process of such an interaction electrons",
    "may be accelerated to high energies , @xmath219 .",
    "( [ gammas ] ) , the mean lorentz factor of accelerated electrons in the agn frame is @xmath220 . for @xmath221 , that is the typical value of @xmath8 for the jets of agns",
    ", we have @xmath222 .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the @xmath11-ray emission of jets is produced when high energy electrons compton - scatter an external radiation which is either the thermal uv radiation of the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole @xcite or the optical and uv emission of gas clouds surrounding the central engine @xcite . in both cases",
    "the typical energy of photons which are scattered by the high energy electrons is @xmath223 ev . at @xmath221 , the mean energy of photons after scattering",
    "is @xmath224 gev , that is consistent with the data on @xmath11-ray emission from agns .                                                                for another arguments in favor of cosmological origin of @xmath11-ray bursters",
