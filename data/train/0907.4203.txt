    "heavy - ion collision experiments running at rhic have provided various information about the new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . to remove theoretical uncertainties in understanding the nature of qgp , first principle calculations by lattice qcd are indispensable .",
    "so far , most lattice studies at finite temperature have been performed using staggered - type quark actions with the fourth - root trick , whose theoretical basis is not fully established yet .",
    "thus , a crosscheck with other actions such as the wilson - type quark actions are important to control and estimate systematic errors due to lattice discretization .",
    "we investigate thermodynamic properties of qgp using the improved wilson quark action . adopting the fixed scale approach developed in @xcite , we perform finite - temperature simulations @xcite , while the corresponding zero - temperature configurations are taken from the results of the cp - pacs and jlqcd collaborations @xcite .    at @xmath1 ,",
    "interaction between a static quark and an antiquark can be studied by the heavy - quark potential evaluated from the wilson loop operator .",

    ", the temperature @xmath13 is varied by changing the temporal lattice size @xmath8 at fixed @xmath10 @xcite . because the spatial volume and the renormalization factors are common to all temperatures , we can directly compare the free - energies at different temperatures without any adjustment .",
