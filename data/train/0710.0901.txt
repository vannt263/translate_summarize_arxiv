    "damped lyman alpha ( dla ) systems are usually considered to be the class of qso absorber with the highest neutral hydrogen column densities [  @xmath4 ] .",
    "nonetheless , the dlas are characterised by generally low metallicities and gas - phase depletion fractions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low reddening due to dust ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dlas are also poor in molecules , as demonstrated by both their generally low fractions of h@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of a detection for any other molecular species , such as oh or co ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the handful of dlas which do exhibit molecular h@xmath5 absorption may be biased , e.g. towards high metallicities @xcite , such systems can offer a novel insight into the physical conditions of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the study of h@xmath5 , one avenue that is just starting to be explored is how the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ; see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be used to probe the intermediate redshift ism .",
    "although lacking definitive identifications , the strength ( both absolute and relative ) of these broad absorption features in the milky way ( mw ) and other nearby galaxies exhibit dependencies on ( and sometimes , tight correlations with ) neutral gas content , dust reddening , metallicity and local radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , if dibs are as strong in dlas as they are in the mw [ i.e.  for a given ] , then they should be relatively easy to detect at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the first systematic search for dibs in dlas has recently been carried out by lawton et al .",
    "( in preparation ) in 7 @xmath6 absorbers . in only one case were dibs detected : the 4428 , 5705 and 5780features were all detected in the @xmath7 dla towards ao 0235@xmath8164 @xcite .",
    "lawton et al .  showed that for the 6 non - detections in their dla sample , the strength of the 5780  dib [ which shows one of the tightest correlations with  in the mw ] is often at least 3 times weaker in dlas for a given  compared with galactic sight - lines .",
    "the 6284  dib is even more under - abundant in dlas for a given : 410 times weaker than towards galactic sight - lines .",
    "a similar result has been found for dibs in the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc and smc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the 5780  dib is typically 1030 times weaker than expected from the galactic relation .",
    "on the other hand , the 5780  dib strength correlates well with  in both galactic and magellanic cloud sight - lines , and the detection towards ao 0235@xmath8164 also lies on the same relationship @xcite .",
    "these results hint that dib formation / survival and high dust content are closely linked and that dibs are therefore most likely to be detected in galaxies with high reddening .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that absorbers identified via high equivalent widths ( ews ) of caii may select the highest  and highest  absorbers .",
    "for example , whereas dlas have been constrained to have  @xmath9 0.04 @xcite , @xcite find that absorbers with caii @xmath103934 ews @xmath110.7  have  values up to @xmath120.1 mag .",
    "caii absorbers may therefore be promising sites for the detection of dibs .",
    "@xcite presented a sample of @xmath13 caii absorbers selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "however , the typical rest wavelengths of the strong dib features ( approximately 45007000 ) makes the @xcite sample unsuitable for an optical search for the diffuse bands .",
    "we have recently conducted an independent search for caii absorbers in the sdss at @xmath14 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) and found over 40 new absorbers .",
    "we selected 9 high - ew ( caii @xmath103934 ew@xmath30.35 ) systems whose redshift places at least one of the strong dibs ( specifically , the 4428 , 5705 , 5780 , 5797 , 6284 and 6613  bands were targeted ) in regions of the spectrum free from atmospheric absorption and night sky emission .",
    "we note that due to the small impact parameters between the qso and the galaxy causing absorption ( typically @xmath15 10 kpc , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the relatively large contribution by galactic light in the sdss fibre , it is probable that some of the caii ew is contributed by galactic photospheric absorption .",
    "the sdss caii ews may therefore not be an accurate measure of the interstellar caii content ( this effect may be minimised when the caii ew can be measured from the fors long slit spectrum ; see table [ dib_table ] ) .",
    "however , the small impact parameters also mean that these galaxies are likely to produce significant absorption from their ism in the qso spectrum and the potential contamination from photospheric absorption does not alter the conclusions of this work [ e.g.  inferred  and ] . table [",
    "obs_table ] lists the targets we give the full sdss identification for each qso but elsewhere we use abbreviated names . ] in our sample , as well as their emission and absorption redshifts , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the latter being derived from a gaussian fit to the ca  ii @xmath10 3934   line ) , and sdss @xmath18-band magnitudes , @xmath19 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ dib_table ]    our search yielded one dib detection : the 5780  band at @xmath20 towards j0013@xmath210024 , the absorber with the highest apparent caii ew in our sample .",
    "figure [ dib_fig ] shows this detection together with the corresponding caii ( from the sdss spectrum ) and nai absorption .",
    "the redshifts of the 5780 dib and nai lines are in excellent agreement with the caii absorption .",
    "depending on the method of weighting the individual exposures , the velocity offsets between various absorption features in the final spectrum are always @xmath22 , i.e. less than one half of a resolution element ; often the agreement is @xmath15 20 .",
    "we measure the ew of the @xmath105780 feature using both a simple integration of optical depth , as well as by a gaussian de - blend in order to account for the presence of a second ( unidentified ) absorption feature offset by @xmath12130  to the red of the dib .",
    "the unidentified feature does not correspond to any known stellar or interstellar features at @xmath23 and we conclude that it is likely to be due to gas at a different redshift .",
    "we also repeat the ew measurements in the uves_popler reduction ; all ew values are in excellent agreement and lie within the statistical 1 @xmath24 error derived from the spectral error array .",
    "our final quoted ew ( see table [ dib_table ] ) adopts an average of the ews determined from various measurement methods and spectral combinations .    for all other caii absorbers with non - detections ,",
    "the 3@xmath24 detection limits are given in table [ dib_table ] .",
    "for the dibs that we would expect to be resolved in our spectra ( the 4428  band in all cases and , e.g. , the 6284  band towards j1009 + 0529 ) we assumed that the absorption would have an observed fwhm of @xmath25 times the typical galactic value ( see above ) .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the number of pixels over which the absorption would be expected to extend .",
    "for the unresolved lines , we assumed that the number of pixels was equal to the fwhm spectral resolution ( in , see table [ obs_table ] ) divided by the dispersion ( in / pixel ) .",
    "in local ( e.g.  galactic , lmc , smc ) sight - lines , the 6284dib is typically 23 times stronger than the 5780  dib ( e.g. , york et al .",
    "2006a and references therein ) .",
    "the one exception is the unusual smc wing sight - line towards sk  143 where the 6284  dib has an ew less than half that of the 5780  dib @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found that in the one dla sight - line with a 5780  band detection out of the 7 studied by lawton et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , the ew of the 6284  feature was also constrained to be less than the ew of the 5780  line .",
    "@xcite suggested that these unusual line ratios could be an indication of an ism that is more protected from the ambient uv radiation field . in the ca ii - selected absorber towards j0013@xmath210024 ,",
    "we constrain the ew of the 6284  dib to be at least @xmath1220% weaker than the 5780band .",
    "the dib ratios in this absorber are therefore consistent with those in the dla detection of @xcite and the smc wing sight - line sk  143 but inconsistent with other local sight - lines , including starburst galaxies @xcite and the magellanic clouds @xcite .    in the galaxy ,",
    "many dibs show correlations with  and @xmath26(nai ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in table",
    "[ dib_table ] we tabulate the ews of the nai doublet for our ca ii - selected absorbers .",
    "however , we do not calculate the na i column density because , if the lines are strong enough to be detected in our moderate resolution spectra , they are likely to be saturated .",
    "the galactic correlations of  and @xmath26(nai ) with the 5780  dib , which is one of the tightest of the dib relations , is shown in fig .",
    "[ ebmv_fig ] .",
    "we also show data for the magellanic clouds @xcite and dlas ( @xcite ; lawton et al .  in preparation ) , where it can be seen that the dibs are weak for their  compared with the galactic correlation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ebmv_fig ] , the dibs in extra - galactic sight - lines are also weak for their nai column densities .",
    "these departures from the galactic relations are probably due to a combination of effects including ambient radiation field , metallicity and dust - to - gas ratios @xcite . assuming that the galactic 5780   relation provides a lower limit for the hi column density",
    ", dib detections may be useful for constraining  in the absence of  observations .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have argued that caii absorbers represent the high column density end of the dla distribution .",
    "our detection of the 5780  dib in the @xmath1 absorber towards j0013@xmath210024 supports this hypothesis , and we derive @xmath2  @xmath3 20.9 for this absorber .    unlike correlations with  and @xmath26(nai ) ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the 5780  dib strength follows a single relationship with  in both galactic and magellanic cloud sight - lines .",
    "@xcite found that the single dla 5780  dib detection towards ao 0235@xmath8164 fell on the same relationship .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the apparent universality of this correlation is driven by a tight physical connection between dust properties and dib formation @xcite or whether it is coincidence of different physical drivers working in different directions @xcite .",
    "however , if the 5780  is applicable to qso absorbers , we can use our dib detection limits to constrain their reddening .",
    "@xcite derive a best fit correlation between the 5780  dib ( in m ) and the  for galactic sight - lines : log  = @xmath212.70 + 1.01 log ew(5780 ) .",
    "we derive the best fit relation to the 5780  data points of the galactic plus magellanic cloud plus ao 0235@xmath8164 dla sight - lines and find log  = @xmath212.19 + 0.79 log ew(5780 ) ( see figure [ ebmv_fig ] ) .",
    "the range in log  values around the best fit relation is @xmath27 0.4 dex .",
    "this correlation gives a reddening for the caii absorber towards j0013@xmath210024 of @xmath28mag and upper limits for the other 8 caii absorbers in our sample of 0.10.3mag .",
    "these values provide independent estimates of reddening associated with ca ii - selected absorbers that do not depend directly on the choice of extinction law and can be applied for individual absorbers and not just in a statistical fashion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the caii ews of our sample are typically @xmath29  ( see table [ dib_table ] ) ; for this range of ews , @xcite determine average reddenings of  = 0.02 , 0.03 and 0.03mag for mw , lmc and smc extinction curves respectively .",
    "we have reported the results from the first search for dibs towards 9 caii - selected absorbers in the redshift range @xmath30 . in one case , the @xmath1 absorber towards j0013@xmath210024 ,",
    "we detect the 5780  dib .",
    "this absorber has the highest caii @xmath10 3934 ew in our sample , although there is some contribution from galactic photospheric absorption in the sdss ew measurement .",
    "j1437@xmath210104 has only a marginally lower caii ew , but a 5780  dib upper limit that is half that of j0013@xmath210024 .",
    "j0013@xmath210024 is only the second qso absorber in which dibs have been detected . assuming that the galactic relation between  and @xmath105780 ew can be used to derive a lower limit for hi column density , we find @xmath2  @xmath3 20.9 .",
    "similarly , the correlation between @xmath105780 ew and  seen in all sight - lines ( galactic and extra - galactic ) to date implies a high reddening in this absorber of  = 0.23mag .",
    "these results provide independent support for the suggestion by @xcite that the caii absorbers are amongst the highest  and most highly reddened of the qso absorbers .",
    "indeed , the  derived for j0013@xmath210024 is even higher than the typical statistical values derived by @xcite . for the other absorbers in our sample we derive upper limits to the reddening of @xmath120.10.3mag .",
    "we also find the interesting result that , in contrast to essentially every local sight - line ( with the exception of one smc wing cloud ) , both qso absorbers with detected dibs have stronger 5780  features than 6284  features , possibly due to less intense radiation fields",
    ".    what are the prospects for further detections of dibs in caii and other qso absorption line systems ? if the relationship of the 5780  dib strength with  is widely applicable , then targetting the most reddened systems is likely the most profitable path .",
    "nonetheless , this is a challenging prospect ; even for an absorber with  = 0.1mag , the rest frame @xmath105780 ew will be @xmath1230 m , which would require an improvement in our current detection limits by typically a factor of 23 .",
    "the best candidates for future observations are likely to be the highest ew caii and mgii absorbers , since these appear to be the most highly reddened of the qso menagerie @xcite . however , with more detections in hand",
    ", it would be possible not only to infer the gas and dust properties of the absorbers , as described above , but also to obtain new insight into the nature of the dibs themselves .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that , in the @xmath31 dla towards ao 0235@xmath8164 , the ratio of the 5705/5780  dibs was consistent with those in galactic sight - lines ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the identification of such dib ` families ' may indicate which bands are associated with the same molecular carrier and hence provide guidelines for their chemical identification . if the galactic 5705/5780 relation holds for the caii absorber towards j0013@xmath210024 , we would expect to detect it with an increase of a factor of three in s / n , possible with approximately one more night of integration .",
