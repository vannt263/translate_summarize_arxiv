    "it should be clear , after a hundred years of development of special relativity , that to search a logical contradiction or paradoxes in it is the same as to search a logical inconsistency in non - euclidean geometry ( in fact , special relativity _ is _ a kind of non - euclidean geometry  the minkowski geometry of space - time ) .",
    "surprisingly , however , such efforts have never been abandoned .",
    "some `` paradoxes '' are helpful nevertheless because their resolution reveals the roots of our confusion and , therefore , enhances our comprehension of special relativity .",
    "the mocanu paradox @xcite is an interesting paradox of this kind whose resolution makes clear some our misconceptions about space and time , deeply rooted in newtonian intuition , which are notoriously hard to eliminate in physics students even after years of study of modern physics .    although the resolution of this `` paradox '' is already available in the literature ( see @xcite ) , `` their arguments and mathematical formulas in terms of coordinates do not give an evident physical explanation of the paradox , though it became clear that the paradox was related somehow to the thomas rotation '' @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this article to demonstrate by elementary means that there is nothing especially paradoxical about the thomas rotation as far as it is considered with regard to the mocanu paradox . to emphasize the physical concepts involved , rather than mathematical formalism",
    ", we consider not the most general case of the mocanu paradox .",
    "however , the special case considered already involves all necessary ingredients .",
    "suppose a reference frame @xmath0 moves with the velocity @xmath1 with respect to the frame `` at rest '' , @xmath2 , along its @xmath3-axis , and a frame @xmath4 moves with the velocity @xmath5 with respect to the frame @xmath0 along its @xmath6-axis .",
    "it is assumed that the corresponding axes of the frames @xmath2 and @xmath0 are parallel to each other , as do axes of the frames @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "then the velocity @xmath7 of @xmath4 relative to @xmath2 is given by the relativistic velocity addition law @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity @xmath1 @xmath10    according to the reciprocity principle @xcite , if @xmath0 moves relative to @xmath2 with velocity @xmath11 , then @xmath2 moves relative to @xmath0 with velocity @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in the frame @xmath4 , the frame @xmath0 moves along the @xmath13 axis with the velocity @xmath14 , while in the frame @xmath0 , the frame @xmath2 moves along the @xmath15 axis with the velocity @xmath16 . compared to the previous situation , the roles of the @xmath3 and @xmath17 axes are interchanged , as are the roles of @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( with additional change of sign ) .",
    "therefore , the velocity addition formula gives the velocity @xmath18 of the frame @xmath2 relative to @xmath4 @xmath19 where @xmath20 corresponds to the velocity @xmath5 .",
    "of course , it is possible to obtain all this by using the general formula for relativistic addition of non - collinear velocities @xcite @xmath21 from which a non - commutativity of this addition is clearly seen , but for our purposes even simpler particular case of this formula for collinear velocities , ( [ u - vel ] ) , suffices if carefully used .    according to the reciprocity principle ,",
    "the velocity of @xmath4 relative to @xmath2 should be @xmath22 , but it clearly does not equal to @xmath23 . and",
    "this constitutes the content of the mocanu paradox : what is the correct velocity of @xmath4 relative to @xmath2 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 , and how we can account for the reciprocity principle in this case ?",
    "we can discard a possibility that the reciprocity principle is violated from the very beginning .",
    "in fact , it is possible and even preferable to base special relativity on this intuitively evident principle , instead of highly counter - intuitive second postulate ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the key idea in resolution of the mocanu paradox is the realization of the fact that space in special relativity is in fact more relative than space in the non - relativistic physics @xcite , although this can hardly be guessed by merely comparing the galilean transformation @xmath26 , which describes relativity of space for non - relativistic observers , to its relativistic counterpart @xmath27 . in words of minkowski ,",
    "`` space by itself , and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows , and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality '' @xcite .",
    "the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined in different reference frames @xmath2 and @xmath30 and , therefore , in different spaces .",
    "it makes no sense to compare them unless the axes of @xmath2 and @xmath4 are made parallel in some well defined way .",
    "axes of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 , as well as axes of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 frames are assumed to be parallel , as mentioned above .",
    "what conclusion we can draw then about the mutual orientation of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 frames axes ?    in the frame @xmath0 , the @xmath31 axis is given by the equation ( we will drop @xmath32-coordinate as it is irrelevant in our planar case ) @xmath33 then , according to lorentz transformations , we conclude that in the frame @xmath2 the @xmath31 axis is given by the equation @xmath34 therefore , from the point of view of @xmath2 , the @xmath31 axis is inclined clockwise relative to the @xmath3 axis by an angle @xmath35 so that @xmath36 there is nothing paradoxical in this change of inclination .",
    "at least nothing more paradoxical than the lack of absolute simultaneity from which it stems .",
    "note that such a change of inclination is used to resolve some pole - and - barn type paradoxes @xcite .",
    "analogously , @xmath13 axis is given in the frame @xmath0 by the equation @xmath37 , which in the frame @xmath2 transforms into @xmath38 therefore , @xmath13 axis is given in the frame @xmath2 by the equation @xmath39 and , consequently , remains parallel to the @xmath17 axis .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] summarizes the orientations of the @xmath31 and @xmath13 axes as seen by an observer in the @xmath2 reference frame",
    ".     axes as perceived in the frame @xmath2.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we need some refinement here . because of the finite speed of light , we should distinguish between what rindler calls @xcite world - picture and world - map .",
    "world - picture is what an observer actually sees at any given moment of time , a snapshot which records distant objects at different moments of the past .",
    "world - map , on the contrary , is the set of events that the observer considers to have occurred in the world at that instant of time .",
    "special relativity operates with world - maps , lorentz transformation being an instrument which relates two world - maps of different inertial frames .",
    "therefore , when we speak rather loosely about what an observer sees or perceives , actually we have in mind the world - map of this observer . with this caveat ,",
    "let us continue and find how the situation described by fig.[fig1 ] is transformed in the frame @xmath4 .",
    "first of all , let us introduce another set of axes @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are parallel to @xmath7 and , therefore , @xmath2 and @xmath4 equipped with these axes are in a standard configuration . in these new axes , fig.[fig1 ] is changed into fig.[fig2 ] .     axes as perceived in the frame @xmath2 relative to the @xmath42 and @xmath44 axes.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    but @xmath45 and @xmath46 therefore , the equation which defines @xmath31 axis in the frame @xmath2 looks like @xmath47 while the equation for the @xmath13 axis is @xmath48 let us apply now the lorentz transformation @xmath49 to change world - map from @xmath2 to @xmath4 . as a result , we get from ( [ eqs ] ) @xmath50 where at the last step we have used @xmath51 analogously , ( [ eqss ] ) transforms into @xmath52 equations ( [ eqi ] ) and ( [ eqii ] ) show that , from the point of view of an observer in the frame @xmath4 , @xmath31 and @xmath13 axes are inclined with respect to the @xmath53 axis ( and , hence , with respect to the line of relative motion ) with angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , as shown in fig.[fig3 ]",
    ".     axes @xmath31 and @xmath13 as perceived in the frame @xmath4 relative to @xmath43 and @xmath56.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    at that @xmath57    while naively one should expect the inclination angle @xmath58 to be the same angle @xmath59 by which the @xmath3 axis is inclined with respect to the @xmath42 axis in the frame @xmath2 , as it would be in case of parallel @xmath3 and @xmath31 axes , it is not , because @xmath60    as we see , although axes of the frames @xmath2 and @xmath0 , as well as @xmath0 and @xmath4 , were rendered parallel , the axes of the frames @xmath2 and @xmath4 turned out not to be parallel in any meaningful way .",
    "space for relativistic observers are more relative than for non - relativistic observers and we should be very careful while interpreting the results of several consecutive non - collinear boosts .    the difference @xmath61 is the notorious thomas rotation and it provides a ready explanation of the mocanu paradox : an observer in the frame @xmath4 really perceives @xmath62 as the velocity of the frame @xmath2 , in agreement with the reciprocity principle , but projects this vector of relative velocity onto @xmath31 and @xmath13 axes to get its components @xmath63    as we see , thomas rotation reconciles the reciprocity principle with the non - commutativity of relativistic velocity addition .",
    "thomas rotation and thomas precession are often considered as obscure relativistic effects which have generated a huge , sometimes confusing literature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this phenomena `` can be quite naturally introduced and investigated in the context of a typical introductory course on special relativity , in a way that is appropriate for , and completely accessible to , undergraduate students '' @xcite .",
    "i think the mocanu paradox provides a very useful possibilities in this respect .",
    "the resolution of the paradox presented in this article was essentially given by ungar @xcite years ago .",
    "i hope , however , that the above presentation is simpler and clarifies some confusion .",
    "for example , it is claimed in @xcite that an observer in @xmath2 sees the axes of @xmath4 rotated relative to his own axes by a thomas rotation angle , @xmath64 .",
    "however , this is not correct .",
    "the observer in @xmath2 `` sees '' what is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "thomas rotation angle , @xmath64 , emerges when we compare the orientation of @xmath4 axes , as actually seen by an observer in @xmath4 , to the naive expectation of the observer in @xmath2 what the observer in @xmath4 should see if the transitivity of parallelism is assumed between different inertial reference frames .",
    "thomas rotation is very basic phenomenon in special relativity which follows quite naturally from its basic premises , as was demonstrated above .",
    "it is as basic as the time dilation and length contraction and is no more paradoxical than these well known effects of special relativity .",
    "of course , this does not mean that it is trivial .",
    "it took years before `` evidence that einstein s addition is regulated by the thomas precession has come to light , turning the notorious thomas precession , previously considered the ugly duckling of special relativity theory , into the beautiful swan of gyrogroup and gyrovector space theory '' @xcite . at this more advanced level",
    ", you can enjoy also other non - euclidean facets of relativistic velocity space @xcite , from which the geometrical meaning of thomas rotation , first discovered by the famous french mathematician mile borel long before thomas found the precession effect @xcite , becomes evident .",
