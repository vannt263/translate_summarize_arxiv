    "topological defects play an important role in two - dimensional physics , and are observed in liquid crystal films @xcite , two - dimensional crystals @xcite , superconducting films @xcite , films of superfluid helium @xcite , arrays of josephson contacts @xcite , nodal points of quantum and microwave billiards @xcite and nodal points in optical waves @xcite .",
    "common to these systems are orientational degrees of freedom with a global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the above systems are either in an orientationally ordered or disordered state . even in the ordered state ,",
    "the orientational order is usually not perfect , but modified by the presence of massless spin waves .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions decay algebraically with distance ( quasi long range order ) . in the disordered state ,",
    "orientational order is destroyed through the spontaneous creation and subsequent unbinding of pairs of topological defects .",
    "the disordered phase is characterized by a finite density of these defects and exponentially decaying correlation functions .",
    "a suitable order parameter for two - dimensional orientational order is a two component vector field @xmath1 .",
    "topological defects are points , where the amplitude of the director field @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "circling around a defect , the phase of @xmath2 adds up @xmath3 ( or rarely multiples of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we distinguish between positive and negative zeros ( defects ) , where the sign of the defects ( sign of the phase jump ) is equal to the sign of the jacobian @xmath4 right at the zero @xmath5 .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) illustrates the two types of zeros .",
    "the planar vector field @xmath6 with a negative zero ( left ) and a positive zero ( right ) .",
    "]    a crucial feature of the defects is the topological constraint on the number of positive zeros minus the number of negative zeros on a closed surface @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of handles of the surface .",
    "a sphere has therefore at least two positive defects , whereas a director field on a torus might be free of defects .",
    "additional defects are created in pairs of opposite sign in order to obey the topological constraint ( [ topol ] ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the distribution of defects in the disordered ( high temperature ) phase , where the director field @xmath2 has a gaussian distribution . at",
    "first we calculate general correlation functions of the ( signed ) defect density for arbitrary vector fields with a gaussian distribution . as an application we study the mean defect density for certain distributions of @xmath2 on curved manifolds .",
    "then we give a transparent derivation of the two - point correlation function for a particular class of vector fields .",
    "finally we check the neutrality of the defect distribution .",
    "densities of zeros were discussed before in the context of nodal points of chaotic wavefunctions in microwave billiards @xcite , random surfaces @xcite and for the xy - model @xcite . extensively studied",
    "are the optical dislocations ( optical vortices ) of `` chaotic '' optical wave fields @xcite which are well modelled by gaussian distributed wave fields .",
    "the distribution of zeros of gaussian random polynomials and gaussian random analytic functions was discussed in @xcite .",
    "random polynomials and random analytic functions have only positive zeros and are therefore quite different from the systems considered here .",
    "we denote the positions of the zeros of a @xmath9-dimensional vector field @xmath10 in @xmath9-dimensional space by @xmath11 and the charge ( type of the extremum ) by @xmath12 .",
    "the charge density reads @xmath13 and can be written as @xmath14 to prove this representation , consider a particular field @xmath10 with a zero at the origin and its expansion @xmath15 for small @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the derivative of @xmath10 at the origin and summation over double indices is implied . then @xmath18 and @xmath19 . combining both , we obtain @xmath20 we consider now a gaussian distributed vector field @xmath10 with correlations @xmath21 and provide a scheme to calculate arbitrary correlation functions @xmath22 of the charge density @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are @xmath25 points and @xmath26 denotes the average with respect to the gaussian distribution of the field @xmath10 .",
    "we write a determinant as an integral over grassmann variables @xmath27 @xmath28 ( for an introduction to the calculus of grassmann variables see @xcite ) .",
    "to regularize the theory it is helpful to replace the sharp delta function by a gaussian with a small but finite width @xmath29 and to use its fourier representation @xmath30 we obtain @xmath31 where the field @xmath32 depends on @xmath33 bosonic coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath33 fermionic variables @xmath35 and reads @xmath36 since @xmath32 is linear in @xmath10 and its derivatives , it has also a gaussian distribution with correlations @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation function for finite width @xmath29 translates into @xmath39 the gaussian average can now be performed with the help of @xmath40 yielding ( summation over double @xmath41 is implied , the partial derivatives act on the leftmost field only ) @xmath42 after a straightforward ( gaussian ) integration over the variables @xmath43 we find @xmath44 where we have introduced the formal metric tensor @xmath45 and its inverse @xmath46 , where a pair of a roman and a greek index @xmath47 is understood as a single composite index .",
    "now we interpret the tensor @xmath48 as the metric tensor of a particular , @xmath49-dimensional manifold .",
    "the manifold is parametrized by @xmath49 internal coordinates @xmath50 .",
    "it becomes singular in the limit @xmath51 whenever at least two points @xmath11 approach , since for two coinciding points two rows of the metric tensor become equal and @xmath52 therefore .",
    "these singular points show up as delta - like singularities in the correlation functions as shown in section [ sumrule ] .",
    "in addition to the metric tensor we introduce an affine connection @xmath53 the affine connection allows us to define a covariant derivative of a covariant vector field @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",

    "the curvature tensor allows us to simplify the expression for the correlation function @xmath63 it is quite remarkable that the correlation function is a purely geometrical object from the point of view of differential geometry ",
    "it depends on the metric tensor and the curvature tensor of a riemann - cartan manifold with metric tensor @xmath64 and affine connection @xmath65 .",
    "it should be noted that correlations of the number density @xcite ( absolute value of the density ) @xmath66 can not be obtained by the above formalism . in case of a vector field @xmath10 placed on a curved riemannian manifold with metric @xmath67",
    ", one has to refer to a covariant version of the density of extrema ( @xmath68 are the internal coordinates to parametrize the manifold , @xmath69 is the covariant derivative related to the metric @xmath70 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 at the zeros of @xmath10 .",
    "the density differs from the euclidean version only by the factor @xmath73 .",
    "a particular important class of vector field are the gradient fields @xmath74 with a gaussian distributed scalar field @xmath75 .",
    "one might think of @xmath75 as a gaussian random surface @xcite with local height @xmath76 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath77 are the extremal points of @xmath75 .",
    "extremal points with a positive signature are the maxima and minima of the function , whereas the saddle points of @xmath75 have a negative sign .",
    "the scalar field @xmath75 should not be confused with the ( polar ) angle @xmath78 of a vector field @xmath79 .",
    "the angular field @xmath78 is defined modulo @xmath80 and has singularities ( at the zeros of @xmath2 ) , whereas the field @xmath75 is nonsingular and single valued .",
    "the metric tensor ( [ metrictensor ] ) for @xmath77 reads @xmath81 ( the latter metric tensor is also introduced in @xcite in the context of excursion sets ) .",
    "the corresponding affine connection @xmath82 is symmetric in the lower indices , i.e. the torsion tensor @xmath83 is zero .",
    "the vanishing torsion characterizes a riemannian manifold , where the affine connection is determined solely by the metric tensor @xmath84 @xmath85 the riemannian curvature tensor reads in this case @xmath86 the defect density correlation function reads @xmath87 , where the grassmann integral @xmath88 is the so - called total curvature .",
    "it is zero for odd dimensions ( here : dimension @xmath89 ) .",
    "its ( covariant ) integral over a ( closed ) surface is a topological invariant according to the theorem of chern ( 1944 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath25-fold spatial integral over the manifold yields @xmath90 we will now specialize our main result ( [ mainresult ] ) .",

    "the mass @xmath93 determines the correlation length @xmath94 of the vector field and , therefore , the distance from the critical point . in addition , we have introduced a curvature dependent mass term as discussed in @xcite . the weight ( [ htw ] ) is invariant under global @xmath95transformations @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the covariant antisymmetric unit tensor with respect to the surface .",
    "the metric tensor reads @xmath98 , since @xmath70 is the only symmetric rank two tensor invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "the affine connection is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the affine connection of the underlying surface . due to the @xmath0 invariance",
    "we can write @xcite @xmath101 and @xmath102 where @xmath103 . the gradient term does not contribute to the curvature tensor since it can be eliminated by a gauge transformation .",
    "the curvature tensor reads ( @xmath104 is the riemann curvature tensor of the surface , @xmath105 is the scalar curvature of the surface ) @xmath106 and @xmath107 the grassmann integral ( [ twod ] ) is now trivial , and we obtain finally @xmath108 the topological constraint ( [ topol ] ) for the total charge is easily verified since @xmath109 due to the theorem of stokes @xcite .",
    "this expression for the density of defects was already obtained by a direct calculation and further analysed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the signed density of zeros of the gaussian xy - model with distribution ( [ htw ] ) is equal ( up to terms of order @xmath110 ) to the charge density of the two - dimensional coulomb gas in the debye - hckel approximation .",
    "this is not surprising , since both approaches can be used to describe the high temperature region of the two - dimensional coulomb gas @xcite . in the next section we show , that the extremal points of a gaussian field @xmath75 behave in a similar manner .",
    "we calculate now the defect density @xmath111 for vector fields which are subject to an additional constraint , namely , the divergence or curl of the field must vanish . a field with vanishing divergence ( curl )",
    "can be expressed via a ` potential ' @xmath75 through @xmath112 or @xmath74 respectively .",
    "we plug this representation of @xmath10 into the weight ( [ htw ] ) and obtain the statistical weight for the scalar field @xmath75 @xmath113\\propto\\exp\\left ( -\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\rmd a((\\lcov\\phi)^2+(\\tau+\\eta r/2)\\partial_i\\phi\\partial^i\\phi)\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the covariant laplace - beltrami operator of the surface .",
    "the defects are the points where the vector field @xmath10 is zero , i.e. where the potential @xmath75 has an extremal point .",
    "the charge of the defect is the sign of the derivate of @xmath10 : @xmath115 for both cases .",
    "the mean defect density is according to theorem ( [ mainresult ] ) @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "the riemannian curvature tensor in two - dimensions has only one independent component  the scalar curvature @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath97 is the covariant , antisymmetric unit tensor with respect to the metric @xmath120 : @xmath121 .",
    "the grassmann integral ( [ twod ] ) is trivial , and we obtain finally @xmath122 the density of defects is according to equation ( [ curvedensity ] ) the scalar curvature of an abstract surface ( riemannian manifold ) with metric @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , with the help of the gauss - bonnet theorem and of equation ( [ curvedensity ] ) @xmath123 where @xmath8 is the genus ( number of handles ) of both the abstract surface @xmath120 and the underlying surface @xmath70 , since the abstract surface is closely related to the underlying surface and especially inherits its topology .",
    "the calculation of the curvature can be done in a large @xmath93-expansion ( high - temperature expansion ) for the special case @xmath124 . from general considerations ,",
    "the first two terms of the @xmath125-expansion of @xmath120 read @xmath126 with constants @xmath127 to be determined . we multiply equation ( [ expansion ] ) with @xmath128 and",

    "the following relations are reported @xmath132 the density @xmath23 can now be obtained using the fact that the metric @xmath120 is conformally equivalent to the underlying metric @xmath70 ( up to order @xmath125 ) . with the further help of equation ( [ curvedensity ] ) we find as our final result and @xmath133",

    "@xmath135 where @xmath136 .    expression ( [ incompress ] ) demonstrates , that the ` gas ' of zeros of an incompressible or irrotational gaussian vector field or likewise the set of extremal points of the potential @xmath75 ( random surface ) behaves _ approximately _ as the two - dimensional coulomb gas in the high temperature phase .",
    "the latter system is well described by the debye hckel hamiltonian for the continuous charge density @xmath23 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the fugacity of the charges . by setting @xmath139",
    ", we obtain for the mean charge density @xmath140 which is equivalent to ( [ incompress ] ) provided we identify @xmath141 .",
    "the analogy between the extremal points of @xmath75 and the coulomb - gas is not perfect and is valid only in the high - temperature region ( see @xcite ) . as already pointed out in section [ sec - gradient ] , the scalar field @xmath75 is a nonsingular , single - valued object and must be distinguished from a field of polar angles @xmath78 . the latter field ( not considered here ) is multivalued and has singularities which behave _ exactly _ as coulomb charges @xcite . for a flat geometry @xmath142 ,",
    "the average defect density is zero , since @xmath143 is also a flat metric with vanishing curvature .",
    "the calculation of the two - point function @xmath144 is done here for a euclidean @xmath9-dimensional geometry and a particular class of ( isotropic ) vector fields @xmath10 with _ independent _ components @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the correlation function reads @xmath147 equipped with an appropriate short - distance cutoff .",
    "examples are random waves @xcite with @xmath148 and the gaussian xy - model @xcite with @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is zeroth order bessel function and @xmath151 is the modified bessel function of order zero .",
    "gradients of gaussian scalar fields do not fall into the above class , since the components of the gradient @xmath77 are not independent .",
    "the metric tensor and its inverse are now @xmath152 where @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "we obtain the curvature tensor @xmath160 where @xmath161 and the indices @xmath162 are not summed .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath163 now reads @xmath164 since the term @xmath165 of the exponential is the only one which contributes to the result .",
    "the square root @xmath166 is therefore cancelled by the prefactor .",
    "the integration over the @xmath78-variables yields an extra factor @xmath167 . denoting @xmath168 we end up with @xmath169 this result",

    "each vector field placed on a closed surface is subject to the topological constraint ( [ topol ] ) , implying a neutrality condition for correlation functions @xmath173 where @xmath67 is the metric tensor of the surface .",
    "analogue constraints apply to higher order correlation functions . to find a neutrality condition for vector fields on an _ infinite _ planar geometry , we note that the density @xmath23 can be written as a divergence ( for a finite width @xmath29 ) @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the error function and @xmath176 is the antisymmetric unit tensor in @xmath9 dimensions",
    ". then the total charge of a vector field is zero , i.e. @xmath177 provided that the correlations @xmath178 decay fast enough ( at least @xmath179 ) for @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function should behave like a delta - function for @xmath181 and @xmath51 since @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the absolute density of zeros @xcite .",
    "we consider now a planar geometry and vector fields with an isotropic distribution .",

    "we have found ( see equation ( [ corrfinal ] ) in the preceding section ) @xmath192 the correlation function of the vector field @xmath193 must be regularized at short distances and can therefore be expanded for small radii @xmath194 , which implies ( for small @xmath29 ) @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",

    "the correlation function @xmath200 can now be interpreted as the gaussian curvature of that cone , which is in fact concentrated at its tip .",
    "using equation ( [ corrfu ] ) , we find the anticipated short - distance behaviour of the two - point correlation function @xmath170 @xmath201",
    "we have proposed a scheme to evaluate correlation functions of the ( charge- ) density of zeros @xmath23 of random vector fields @xmath10 with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the zeros carry a charge @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the jacobian of the vector field right at the zero . in two dimensions for instance , positive zeros resemble sources , sinks or vortices , while negative ones have a saddle - like flow .",
    "we could show that the correlation functions @xmath204 can be expressed through the curvature of an abstract @xmath49-dimensional riemann - cartan manifold ( @xmath9 is the dimension of both the vector field and the embedding space ) . in the case of gradient fields",
    "@xmath74 , the correlation functions are the total curvature of a certain @xmath49-dimensional riemannian manifold . as an application , we have calculated the mean charge density for various vector fields on curved two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "furthermore , we derived the two - point function for isotropic vector fields with independent components .",
    "we checked the neutrality sum rule , which follows from the topological constraint of the total charge and obtained in addition the short - distance behaviour of the two - point correlation function .",
    "we have seen that the zeros of gaussian vector fields are a model for the two - dimensional coulomb gas in the high - temperature region .",
    "this opens a convenient route to study these systems in curved or bounded geometries .",
    "the geometrical view helps to calculate one- and two - point correlation functions and could also be rather useful to ` tame ' the higher order correlation functions of gaussian zeros .",
    "the present work demonstrates that the signed zeros of vector fields with a gaussian distribution are not only sensitive to curvature , the correlation functions of the charge density _ are _ the curvature of an abstract manifold , which is closely related to the embedding manifold .",
