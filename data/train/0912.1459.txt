    "in all advanced quantum chemistry calculations the evaluation of the huge number of two - electron repulsion integrals ( eris ) consistutes the major computational obstacle . it is thus not surpising that one searches for efficient methods to accurately approximate these integrals .",
    "most known is the method of resolution of identity ( ri ) , see , e.g. the reviews  @xcite and references therein , which has been widely used to compute energies and other properties of molecules .",
    "a few decades ago beebe and linderberg have published an original paper about reducing computational efforts of ab initio methods by using cholesky decomposition ( cd ) of the two - electron integral matrix  @xcite . within the cd method",
    "the accuracy of representation of the exact eris is controlled only by a single parameter , the so - called cholesky decomposition threshold @xmath3 . by construction",
    ", it provides an upper bound to the absolute difference between an exact eri and its approximated value .",
    "one of the key advantages of the cd approach is that the error introduced to the eris can be made as small as needed .",
    "recently , the cd approach has been successfully combined with mp2 perturbation theory  @xcite , with casscf configuration interaction methods  @xcite and with the cc2 linear response theory  @xcite . by using the cd approach one can speed up electron correlated calculations up to a few hundred times , thus enabling applications to large quantum systems ( many atoms and many basis functions ) . moreover , within the cd method one can perform correlated calculations of systems , which can not be attacked using ordinary conventional techniques .",
    "our goal is to study the performance of cd in electron propagator calculations .",
    "we would like to mention that flores - moreno and ortiz have investigated and applied the ri method in the context of electron propagator theory  @xcite .",
    "electron propagator theory ( ept ) has been proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the electronic structure of bound and unbound , metastable , states .",
    "indeed , the ept is widely used for the direct calculation of vertical ionization and attachment energies  @xcite , and more recently also of widths and positions of short - lived electronic states ( resonances )  @xcite . in particular , methods have been formulated as a combination of the ept and a stabilization technique and successfully used for describing resonant states of anions  @xcite .    normally , the error of computed total energies ( using standard methods like e.g. scf , mp2 , casscf , caspt2 ) or response properties introduced by the cd approximation has the same order of magnitude as @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , beebe and linderberg made the assumption that electron propagators should be tolerant to the cholesky decomposition threshold : `` @xmath4 for propagator methods which directly compute energy differences , for an accuracy of @xmath5 in the transformed two - electron integrals will be more than adequate for most purposes @xmath4 ''  @xcite .",
    "in the last few years substantial progress has been made in further optimization of the cd method .",
    "in particular , a new , so - called _ atomic _ cd version has been developed by f. aqualiante et al .",
    "the main goal of our present work is to investigate the feasibility of using the cd approaches including the atomic version for electron - propagator methods .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a set of real spatial basis functions and @xmath7 denote the corresponding one - electron product density set .",
    "one of the basic quantities in quantum chemistry is a two - electron repulsion integral ( eri ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .    since eri is a four - indexed quantity , both the number of distinct eris and the time required for their evaluation increase as @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 scaling forms one of the basic obstacles to ab initio calculations with a finite basis set . the density fitting ( df )  @xcite or resolution of identity ( ri )  @xcite and cholesky decomposition ( cd )  @xcite methods are very efficient approaches to reduce scaling .",
    "the key idea in all of these methods is to factorize an eri into a product form of three - indexed quantities  @xcite : @xmath12 the scaling now is @xmath13 .",
    "this factorization also significantly reduces i / o , memory demands and also reduces the scaling of the atomic orbital ( ao ) to molecular orbital ( mo ) transformation from @xmath14 to @xmath15  @xcite . the last issue is crucial for post - hf methods . denote the mo expansion coefficients matrix by * c * , then an eri in mo representation can be calculated by exploiting the same factorization  ( [ factorization ] ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denote mo indices and @xmath18 : @xmath19    df / ri and cd approaches vary in the generation of the intermediate @xmath20 . in order to demonstrate the interplay between df / ri and cd techniques we would like to derive the given factorization  ( [ factorization ] ) by lwdin s inner projection technique  @xcite(see also  @xcite ) .",
    "let us introduce the expansion basis set of functions @xmath21 in the domain of the coulomb operator @xmath22 and construct a projection operator * p * as follow : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25th element of the inverse @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the inner projection of the coulomb operator * v * on * p * takes on the form @xmath28 and provides the following approximation to an eri : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the error introduced by the incompleteness of the expansion basis set .",
    "the double sum in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ int_approx ] ) is the famous * v*-approximation which comes from the ri methodology  @xcite . noting that since @xmath31 is a positive definite operator and @xmath32 is the lower bound to it , @xmath33 satisfies the schwarz inequality : @xmath34    the difference between cd and df / ri methods are the generation of the expansion basis set @xmath35 or , in other words , they differ in the fitting of the original density product set @xmath36 . here , there are two possibilities to construct expansion basis sets : using a native subset of the original product density set or using an external auxiliary basis set .",
    "the cd method forms an expansion basis set from the original @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it exploits the linear dependence of the original product density set in the coulomb metric  @xcite .",
    "thus , the cd method is the ab initio density fitting by construction ( by design ) . for constructing a linear independent subset of @xmath36",
    "it is convenient to apply the classical gram - schmidt ( cgs ) method using @xmath31 as the weighting factor : @xmath38\\thinspace,\\ ] ] where the normalization constant @xmath39 is given by @xmath40    this recursive procedure is continued as long as the norm of the new vector @xmath41 ( at step @xmath42 ) is greater than the threshold for linear dependency @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath43 , or equivalently , @xmath44  @xcite . the threshold @xmath3 is known as the _ cholesky decomposition threshold _ and the resulting non - redundant subset is known as the _ cholesky basis_. as a rule of thumb , if @xmath45 , then  @xcite : @xmath46    it is interestingly to note that the same idea of using the cgs procedure for generating expansion basis set has been suggested by whitten in the frame of the df approach about 30 years ago  @xcite . by taking into account that @xmath47 and returning to the original set of pair of indices , the final expression of eq .",
    "( [ int_approx ] ) in the cholesky basis takes on the form : + @xmath48 where the intermediate @xmath49 is the projection of the @xmath50 product on the @xmath51th vector of @xmath35 . the vector @xmath52 is known as _ integral table_. the number of eris needed for the generation of @xmath53 integral tables is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . in actual practice",
    "a modified cholesky decomposition algorithm  @xcite is used for calculating the intermediates @xmath49 instead of cgs because the latter is numerically unstable  @xcite .",
    "the cholesky basis has three important features .",
    "first , it is optimal in the sense that it provides a rigorous upper bound for the value @xmath33 , i.e. : @xmath56 an important point that if @xmath57 and @xmath58 have been involved in the cgs orthonormalization process , then the corresponding integral is represented exactly  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the machine epsilon .",
    "this means that @xmath61 integrals corresponding to the product densities of @xmath35 will be generated exactly ( within machine precision ) by eq .",
    "( [ cd ] )  @xcite .",
    "second , the cholesky basis is continuous in the sense that by decreasing the threshold @xmath3 the inner projection @xmath32 smoothly becomes better and better and formally exact when asymptotically @xmath62 , i.e. : @xmath63 in the finite precision arithmetic this limit is reached with a cholesky threshold less or equal to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "thus , by using the cd approximation the error introduced to eri can be made as small as desired .",
    "this features is a great advantage of the cd method .",
    "third , the cholesky basis set can be constructed on the fly for any arbitrary ao basis set , even for non - standard ones .",
    "such a flexibility is important when calculating short - lived electronic states , where it is essential to extend an original ao basis set by adding external sets of basis functions for describing the continuum wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the full - cd is the total price in the number of operations ( multiplication , addition , square roots and array indexing is @xmath66 . by construction",
    ", the cholesky basis generally contains both one - center and two - center one - electron densities which lead to the calculation of expensive four - center eris and , more important , to a dependence of the cholesky basis on the molecular geometry  @xcite . to overcome these shortcomings",
    "a so - called atomic cd ( acd ) modifications has been developed recently . in the acd version",
    "the cholesky basis contains only one - center product densities for each unique atom / ao basis set pair which reduces the computational effort considerably and leads to smooth potential energy surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the acd ( _ atomic cholesky _ ) basis set provides strict error control  ( [ stricterr ] ) on the one - center and two - center `` coulomb '' eris but three- and four - centers integrals and `` exchange '' two - center integrals may be affected by large errors  @xcite . unlike the full - cd approach",
    ", the accuracy of the acd method can not be improved beyond a certain limit , which is weakly dependent on the decomposition threshold .",
    "nonetheless , recently it has been shown that the acd approach does not downgrade the accuracy to any significant degree and the introduced error is slightly larger than that of the original full - cd  @xcite .",
    "there is a further optimization of the acd basis , the so - called atomic compact cd ( accd ) basis set .",
    "the accd is the result of removing the linear dependence among the primitive gaussians  @xcite .",
    "as has been demonstrated recently in a serie of papers , the accuracy of acd and accd are very close to each other  @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the cholesky basis sets are generated from first principles and are not biased to any quantum chemical method . for a detailed discussion on atomic cd",
    "we refer to the review  @xcite .",
    "= 0    in contrast to the above mentioned _ ab initio _ cholesky basis sets , the df / ri auxiliary basis sets have been optimized to reproduce accurately certain specific quantities . the key point in the development of auxiliary basis sets",
    "is to provide a balance between the accuracy of the computed quantities and the numerical effort required .",
    "the balanced auxiliary basis set should fulfil two requirements . first of all its size should be only a few times ( 3 - 4 ) larger than the size of the original ao basis set .",
    "second , the error introduced due to the df / ri approximation should be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the error resulting from one - electron basis set incompleteness .",
    "technically , an auxiliary basis set is optimized by minimizing the deviation between the exact target quantity and that calculated via the df / ri approximation in a set of atomic and molecular calculations for a certain combination of pair ao basis set and level of theory .",
    "one of the best approved family of auxiliary basis sets is ri - x ( x = j , jk , c ) , where x refers to the theoretical method used in the parameterization  @xcite .    in particular , the ri - jk family of auxiliary basis sets was developed to reproduce the hf coulomb and exchange energies : @xmath67 whereas ri - c was invented to reproduce the mp2 correlation energy :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 denote virtual , and @xmath70 denote occupied hf orbitals . later on httig",
    "et al . demonstrated that the ri - c auxiliary basis sets also suitable for calculating ground state and excitation energies at the cc2 level of theory  @xcite .",
    "the typical errors produced by ri - x auxiliary basis sets for a target quantity are about a fraction of few tenths or even few hundredth of @xmath71 per atom .",
    "however , in the case of an inappropriate combination of ao and ri - x basis sets and level of theory the resulting error can increase drastically and be a few orders of magnitude larger than suggested in the original papers  @xcite .",
    "the other issue is the application of the df / ri scheme in combination with augmented ao basis sets .",
    "for example , an augmented basis set can be obtained from the original ao set by adding some special basis functions .",
    "potentially , the use of such combinations might lead to inconsistent results .",
    "this possibility is related to the fact that the standard published auxiliary basis sets have not been developed for fitting the product densities resulting from the augmented basis functions , i.e. they do not contain suitable functions to span the product densities resulting from the added new basis functions .    according to published data",
    "one may conclude that the ri - x bases have the same quality as acd / accd with a cholesky decomposition threshold in the range @xmath72 to @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "typically , the cholesky basis sets are somewhat larger than the corresponding ri - c ones and , therefore , require a higher computational cost which is a reasonable price to pay for an unbiased and highly accurate auxiliary basis set .",
    "green s function or propagator theory is well established and we just briefly describe it also mentioning some computational details .",
    "most of one - particle propagator methods are based on the well - known dyson equation  @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the one - particle green s function , @xmath76 is an energy dependent non - local potential called self - energy and @xmath77 is the _ free _ green s function .",
    "formally , the ionization potentials ( ips ) and electron affinities ( eas ) of the system under consideration are poles of @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the diagonal matrix of the canonical hf one - electron energies and @xmath81 is a unit matrix . for convenience ,",
    "the poles of @xmath78 can be found from @xmath82    the self - energy @xmath76 itself also possesses a spectral representation  @xcite and this can be used to solve eq .",
    "( [ dysonsol2 ] ) by solving an eigenvalue equation .",
    "if the elements of @xmath76 are explicitly known , the solution of the dyson equation becomes particularly compact  @xcite .",
    "in this work we resort for simplicity of representation to the so - called _ quasi - particle _ approximation , in which the self - energy is diagonal and eq .",
    "( [ dysonsol2 ] ) reduces to :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the mo index related to the ip or to the ea we are looking for . in practice eq .  ( [ qpapp ] )",
    "is solved iteratively via the newton - raphson method @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the so - called _ pole strength _ :",
    "@xmath87 the iterative procedure usually starts from a hf one - electron energy of the @xmath84th mo ( @xmath88 ) and continues until the absolute difference between previous and current values of a pole is smaller than some given threshold , say @xmath89 : @xmath90    there are several successful approximations to @xmath76 in the literature  @xcite . here , for simplicity of presentation we employ the well - known expression of second - order perturbation theory . in the second order ,",
    "the @xmath84th diagonal element of the self - energy reads @xmath91 where @xmath69 denote virtual , and @xmath70 occupied spatial hf orbitals .",
    "the second order contains the most relevant relaxation and correlation corrections to koopman s theorem  @xcite and self - energy provides convenient checks of new computer codes and the computational experience necessary to implement more general approximations .",
    "all calculations presented here are on c@xmath1 which is an ideally suited object as it contains many atoms and is of general interest documented by numerous investigations .",
    "all calculations of ground and ionic states of @xmath92 were performed in @xmath93 symmetry at the experimental gas - phase geometry : @xmath94 and @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "the ao basis sets used in this work are dunning s cc - pvxz ( x = d , t ) basis sets  @xcite and the respective total number of basis function are 840 and 1800 . throughout",
    ", the spherical representation of the d- and f - basis functions was used .",
    "the calculations with cd were performed by using the molcas quantum chemistry program  @xcite .",
    "the df / ri mp2 calculations were carried out using the turbomole  @xcite quantum chemistry package with suitable ri - c and ri - jk auxiliary basis sets corresponding to the original set aos  @xcite .",

    "fully direct hf and mp2 calculations were carried out with the pc gamess / firefly program suite  @xcite .",
    "for open shell calculations at the hf level the restricted open - shell approach ( rohf ) has been employed  @xcite .    for calculating ips and eas in the quasiparticle approximation with @xmath96 we developed a parallel program called @xmath0 .",
    "as input data the @xmath0 uses integral tables in ao representation and scf mo lcao coefficients which are generated with the molcas program .",
    "execution of @xmath0 consists in two separate steps : parallel transformation of integral tables from the ao to the mo representation by eq .",

    "( [ iter ] ) . the eris needed during the iterative solution",
    "are recomputed in parallel by formula  ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "more details about the structure and parallelization of @xmath0 will be the subject of a forthcoming manuscript .",
    "all electron propagator calculations in the present paper were fully correlated , i.e. all electrons were taken into account at the @xmath96 level of theory . for the energy conversion of units the factor 1 hartree @xmath9727.211396 ev was used .",
    "first , we would like to introduce the abbreviations used in this chapter .",
    "cd - n refers to the full - cd decomposition with threshold @xmath98 .",
    "acd - n * and accd - n * mean `` _ _ atomic cholesky _ _ '' basis and its compact form , respectively .",
    "acd - n or accd - n basis sets have been formed from the original acd - n*/accd - n * ones by removing the highest angular momentum orbitals .",
    "the term `` _ _ low cholesky _ _ '' stands for the full - cd results obtained with a decomposition threshold @xmath3 in the range from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , and `` _ _ medium cholesky _ _ '' and `` _ _ high cholesky _ _ '' are for thresholds in the range @xmath73 to @xmath99 and @xmath99 to @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we would like to start the discussion with mp2 ground state energies because the expressions for mp2 , eq .  ( [ mp2 ] ) , and @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) , are quite similar . for the sake of convenience and clarity",
    ", we decompose the mp2 total energy into a sum of two contributions @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the hf energy and the mp2 correlation energy , respectively . with the decomposition given in eq .",
    "( [ mp2d ] ) , the total mp2 energy error takes on the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "figure 1 shows the total mp2 energy error @xmath106 and its contributions @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "first of all , figure 1 clearly represents the accuracy of approximations used : the high cholesky results approach the exact one , df / ri and the low cholesky results are the least accurate and atomic cd results are between them . within the atomic cd series",
    ", one can see that the acd*/accd * results are on the high - accuracy side , whereas its optimized ( reduced ) acd / accd version are on the lower - accuracy side .",
    "we should stress that the observed tendencies are in full agreement with previously published data  @xcite .",
    "the next important issue concerns the convergence rates of the energies of the full - cd approximation . from figure 1 , it becomes evident that the main source of error here comes from the hf method .",
    "we now analyze this trend in more detail .",
    "table i reports the total mp2 energies calculated by using full - cd and df / ri approximations . by comparing results from the 3-rd and 4-th columns or from the 6-th and 7-th columns with the reference numbers ,",
    "we conclude that the correlation energy @xmath109 converges much faster than the corresponding hf energy @xmath110 .",
    "we attribute this behaviour to the fact that the hf total energy is an expectation value , while the mp2 correlation energy is a correction quantity . using cd or",
    "df / ri leads to loss in accuracy of the computed eris and it is well - known that computing corrections is numerically more robust with respect to the precision of input data , than computing expectation values due to cancellation of errors .    in view of the results of this chapter we expect propagator methods to be robust with respect to cholesky decomposition thresholds .",
    "the gs of @xmath92 is @xmath111 . removing a single electron yields an @xmath112 cationic ground state , while the attachment of an extra electron yields a @xmath113 anionic ground state .",
    "the anion @xmath114 is known to be bound by 2.68 ev in the gas phase  @xcite .",
    "the first adiabatic ionization energy of @xmath92 has been estimated to be 7.64 ev  @xcite .",
    "table ii lists the results for the first vertical ip and first ea obtained by two uncorrelated approximations : by applying koopmans theorem ( kt )  @xcite and by the delta - scf ( @xmath115 ) method  @xcite .",
    "kt results are obtained from the hf calculations on the neutral fullerene .",
    "the ip is obtained from the energy of the homo and the ea - from the energy of the lumo .",
    "@xmath115 refers to the difference between the total hf energy of neutral and that of its ions . from table",
    "ii , we can see that the calculated quantities depend only slightly on the decomposition threshold .",
    "the maximal error introduced by the cd approximation is 1 @xmath2ev or less .",
    "in contrast to the hf total energy ( see table i ) , the @xmath115 results converge much faster . for a threshold of @xmath116 or less ,",
    "the error in the computed ip and ea is negligible .",
    "this finding clearly verifies the predicted robustness of relative quantities to the decomposition threshold .    in table iii and table",
    "iv , we present main results of the present paper . these tables report the calculated first ip and ea employing various cholesky decompositions and valence basis sets at the @xmath117 level . as one would expect , the computed quantities are not very sensitive to the cholesky decomposition threshold .",
    "even the low cholesky results have a very encouraging level of accuracy of 1 @xmath2ev . starting from @xmath118 ,",
    "the medium cholesky results approximate the exact ones ( @xmath119 ) fairly well .",
    "clearly , the full cholesky basis sets provide superior convergence in calculating first ips and eas .",
    "interestingly , the atomic cd results resemble the full - cd ones . from table iii and iv",
    ", it is clearly seen that here there is no difference in the results obtained using original atomic cholesky basis or its compact form ( acd - n vs accd - n or acd - n * vs accd - n * ) . in the case of atomic cd ,",
    "the most pronounced changes occur by removing higher orbital products , i.e. in going from acd - n * to acd - n or from accd - n * to accd - n cholesky basis sets . within acd - n / accd - n cholesky basis sets , the maximal error in the first ip /",
    "ea potential is 2 @xmath2ev .    in order to investigate in more detail the influence of cholesky basis sets on the calculated ip and ea , we extend the energy window of the calculated potentials .",
    "now , all canonical hf orbitals lying in the energy range from -14.272 to 4.088 ev in the cc - pvdz basis set , and from -14.303 to 9.903 ev in the cc - pvtz basis set , are taken into account , and only poles of the propagator which are related to quasiparticles are considered in the subsequent error analysis . before discussing further , we would like to identify two issues : the reference results and the precision of the statistical results . in the error analysis of the computed spectrums",
    "the @xmath120/cd-10 results are used as reference .",
    "since we use @xmath89 as the convergence threshold in the @xmath120 iterative procedure  ( [ nr ] ) , all computed statistical characteristics which are below the given threshold should be considered zero .",
    "the reference spectra ( ips , eas and their pole strengths as a function of energy ) of c@xmath1 obtained with the cc - pvdz and cc - pvtz valence basis sets are shown in figure 2 .",
    "while calculations using propagators are available for the ips even beyond second order self - energies  @xcite , no ab initio calculations on the eas of c@xmath1 have been reported so far because of the large computational effort involved . experimental ips and eas",
    "are available in literature , see e.g.  @xcite . in figure 2",
    ", we see that enlarging the basis set shifts the eas and ips to lower energies by an amount which is approximately constant for each of these groups of quantities .",
    "the second order understimates the first ip and inclusion of higher order corrections is essential for a quantitative prediction ( see ovgf and adc(3 ) results in table ii ) . in this work ,",
    "we are not concerned with the absolute quality of the self - energy used .",
    "we are rather concerned with the accuracy of the calculations using a given self - energy and the cd technique .",
    "in addition , utilizing the cd enables us to attack larger molecules which can not computed otherwise .",
    "we now turn to the error analysis of the various cd approximations used .",
    "the data shown in figure 3 and figure 4 confirm the observed feature of the full cholesky basis sets discussed above . as in the case of the first ip and ea , the full - cd spectral results for @xmath121 or less are exact within the prescribed accuracy limit ( 10 @xmath122 or 0.27 @xmath123 ) . from the figures ,",
    "it is also evident that the full - cd results depend on the decomposition threshold , but they are only slightly affected by the quality of the ao basis set used .",
    "in other words , full - cd basis sets introduce nearly uniform spectral errors which only slightly depend on the ao basis set used .",
    "in particular , the rmax ( rms ) value for cd-4 are 265 ( 81 ) and 262 ( 67 ) @xmath122 in the cc - pvdz and cc - pvtz basis sets , respectively .",
    "consequently , low cholesky results have a reasonable accuracy of a few @xmath2ev , a finding which is of practical relevance .",
    "in contrast to the full - cd results , the atomic cd ones are sensitive to the quality of the ao basis set used . by going from double- to triple - zeta - quality ao basis sets , we substantially decrease the overall error ( rmax and rms are reduced by factor of 7 ) of the spectra computed using ( n=4,6 ) cholesky basis sets . in the case of cholesky basis",
    "sets the improvements are not so pronounced . in the triple - zeta basis",
    "set , the acd - n*/accd - n * ( n=4,6 ) results are only 1.07 to 3.63 times better than in the double - zeta set . for cc - pvtz ao ,",
    "the and cholesky basis sets provide sub - milli - electron - volt accuracy , the corresponding value of rmax and rms are about 18 and 5 @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "we note that the acd-6*/accd-6 * results in both ao basis sets used coincide with the reference ones .",
    "interestingly , the acd-4/accd-4 results in the cc - pvtz ao basis set have milli - electron - volt accuracy , which is much better than the accuracy of the cd-4 . for instance",
    ", the rmax ( rms ) value in the cc - pvtz basis set for acd-4/accd-4 and cd-4 are about 46 ( 16 ) and 262 ( 67 ) @xmath122 , respectively .    in order to characterize the origin of errors in the spectra due to cd",
    ", we have made a linear regression analysis between the reference results ( cd-10 ) and the others .",
    "the resulting correlation coefficients are 1.00000 .",
    "figure 5 displays a typical picture resulting from the regression analysis .",
    "obviously , the error due to cd is systematic .",
    "therefore , the cd approach leads essentially to a uniform shift of the whole spectrum . even in the worst case ( cd-4 ) addressed in figure s1 in the supplementary material",
    ", this shift amounts only to 1 @xmath2ev .      in order to demonstrate the computational power of the developed @xmath0 program we would like to provide some timings . as is well - known",
    "one of the main bottlenecks of quantum chemistry is the transformation of eris from ao to mo representation . for the @xmath0 program running on 150 cores ( 50 nodes x 3 cores ) the typical timings of the ao to mo transformation in the cc - pvtz valence basis set range from 20s to 100s within the full - cd series and from 9s to 25s in case for the acd ones . by using the same number of cores the wall time needed to pass one nr iteration  ( [ nr ] ) is between 15s and 25s .",
    "recall that the total number of basis functions in cc - pvtz for c@xmath1 is 1800 .",

    "figure 6 depicts the time needed to complete cd in various cholesky and valence basis sets .",
    "as one can see , the acd computational scheme is at least one order of magnitude faster than the full - cd ones . in particular ,",

    "in the present work we demonstrate the robustness of the one - particle electron propagator method with respect to cholesky decomposition schemes for two - electron integrals .",
    "all decomposition schemes reported in the literature are used .",
    "we found that even for moderate cholesky decomposition thresholds ( @xmath124 ) the maximal error in computed electron affinities and ionization potentials is rather small ( @xmath1251 @xmath2ev ) and is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the error arising from the incompleteness of the ao basis sets used .",
    "the full cholesky decomposition exhibits excellent convergence properties with respect to the decomposition threshold . for electron propagator methods",
    "there is no need to use small ( @xmath126 ) thresholds .",
    "the atomic cholesky basis sets speed up the calculations by several orders of magnitude without leading to a significant loss in accuracy . in particular",
    ", we conclude that accd - n and accd - n * ( n=4,6 ) cholesky basis sets provide optimal compromise between performance and accuracy .",
    "the error introduced by the cholesky decomposition has a systematic behavior .",
    "varying the decomposition threshold leads to a nearly uniform shift of the energy of the whole spectrum , i.e. all calculated poles are shifted by about the same value .",
    "we want to stress that the results presented could be obtained in a reasonable time only because of the efficient parallel algorithm employed and by utilizing a massive parallel computer . by using the",
    "cholesky decomposition technique and parallel computing one is now able to perform large - scale electron propagator calculations , which were impossible before via conventional techniques .",
