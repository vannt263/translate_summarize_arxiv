    "the quantum mechanical effects resulting from time - dependent boundary conditions have been studied by some authors @xcite . diffraction in time",
    "was initially introduced by moshinsky @xcite by considering a situation involving a beam of particles impinging from the left on a totally absorbing shutter located at the origin which is suddenly turned off at an instant . in such an example",
    ", the transient probability current has a close mathematical resemblance with the intensity of light resulting from the fresnel diffraction by a straight edge .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "an interesting feature of the solutions for cutoff initial waves , occurring both in the free case @xcite and in the presence of a potential interaction @xcite , is that , if initially there is a zero probability for the particle to be at @xmath3 , as soon as @xmath4 , there is instantaneously , a finite , though very small , probability to find the particle at any point @xmath3 .",
    "this non - local behavior of the schrdinger solution is due to its nonrelativistic nature and not a result of the quantum shutter setup @xcite .",
    "application of the klein@xmath5gordon equation to the shutter problem @xcite shows that the probability density is restricted to the accessible region @xmath6",
    "( @xmath7 is the speed of light ) .",
    "gerasimov and kazarnovskii @xcite confined the initial wave in a finite region by introducing a second shutter at the point @xmath8 .",
    "godoy @xcite pointed out the analogy with fraunhoffer diffraction in the case of small box ( compared to the de broglie length ) , and fresnel diffraction , for larger confinements .    on the other hand",
    ", the phenomenon of quantum superarrivals for the reflection and transmission of a gaussian wave packet in the case of a rectangular potential barrier while it is perturbed by either reducing or increasing its height has also been considered @xcite .",
    "there exists a finite time interval during which the probability of reflection is larger ( superarrivals ) when the barrier is lowered compared to the unperturbed case @xcite .",
    "similarly , during a certain interval of time , the probability of transmission when the barrier is raised exceeds that for free propagation @xcite .",
    "such studies suggest that the time - varying boundary conditions can give rise to interesting action - at - a - distance effects in quantum mechanics .",
    "exactly solvable models give important points about the quantum many - body physics .",
    "the thonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite is a such model , which corresponds to infinitely repulsive bosons in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "this model is exactly solvable via a fermi - bose mapping , which relates the tg gas to a system of noninteracting spinless fermions in 1d @xcite .    in this context , by considering the problem of a confined particle in a linear potential , the aim of the present paper is to probe some aspects of the time - dependent boundary conditions that have remained hitherto unnoticed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : review ] we review the solution of the schrdinger equation for a confined particle in half space @xmath9 with the potential @xmath1 and consider the various time - dependent boundary condition of the problem .",
    "section [ sec : qu_st ] briefly deals with quantum statistics .",

    "so far we have not consider quantum statistics .",
    "we shall next consider dynamics of the ground state of a system of @xmath44 noninteracting spinless fermions initially confined in half - space @xmath0 in the presence of a linear potential .",
    "since wavefunctions of noninteracting spinless fermions are antisymmetric under coordinate exchanges , their wavefunctions vanish automatically whenever any @xmath45 : @xmath46 the single particle density , normalized to @xmath44 , is @xmath47 it follows from the fermi - bose mapping theorem @xcite that the exact @xmath48bosons ground state wavefunction @xmath49 of a system of @xmath44 bosons with hard - wall interaction is @xmath50",
    "in this section we work in a unit system where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath53 anywhere the potential is nonzero .",

    "one can check numerically in the limit @xmath60 , last line of the above expression is very small compared to the two first terms . as a result of",

    "after a certain time @xmath61 , for even @xmath62 , @xmath63 has a local minimum at @xmath23 and its @xmath62 maxima are distributed symmetrically around @xmath23 , but for odd @xmath62 it has a local maximum at @xmath23 and other @xmath64 maxima locate symmetrically around the central maximum , i.e. , @xmath65 maxima at the right and @xmath65 maxima at the left of the origin .",
    "another feature of @xmath63 is that it has no node after a certain time of letting the particle to be free . from eq .",

    "another physically interesting quantity is the probability current density @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig : denx_c ] has always @xmath62 nodes in spite of fig .",
    "[ fig : denx_b ] .",
