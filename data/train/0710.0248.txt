    "at the tevatron collider , one of the main challenges is the search for the higgs boson and for supersymmetric particles .",
    "the high integrated luminosities being collected by both the cdf and d0 experiments enable searches with unprecedented sensitivity . at the beginning of 2007 ,",
    "both experiments have recorded data sets of more than 2@xmath0 .",
    "recent results obtained with up to 1.1@xmath0 are presented in this note .",
    "all limits quoted are at 95% confidence level .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) the higgs mechanism is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , thereby generating the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons . as a consequence of this mechanism a single neutral scalar particle , namely the higgs boson , remains after the symmetry breaking . assuming the validity of the standard model , global fits to the electroweak data prefer a relatively low mass for the higgs boson , @xmath3@xcite , while direct searches at the lep collider set a lower bound on the mass of @xmath4@xcite .    at low masses , @xmath5 , the sm",
    "higgs boson dominantly decays via @xmath6 . for the main production channel , which is the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath7 this leads to signatures which are irreducible from qcd production of @xmath8 pairs .",
    "therefore , at the tevatron the highest sensitivity for low mass higgs bosons is obtained from the associated production of the higgs boson with the weak bosons , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at high masses",
    "the sm higgs boson predominantly decays into @xmath11 boson pairs , which has a manageable background for the @xmath7 production mode .",
    "both the cdf and d0 collaborations searched for low mass higgs bosons using the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 production and decay modes . dominating backgrounds in these searches are the associated production of the weak bosons with @xmath8 pairs , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as the associated production @xmath18 and @xmath19 with jets originating from light - flavor quarks , which are falsely identified as @xmath20-jets .",
    "the cdf collaboration recently presented a search for the higgs boson in @xmath13 production based on an integrated luminosity of 1@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the event selection required a reconstructed electron or muon with a transverse momentum @xmath21 , two jets with transverse energy @xmath22 and large missing transverse momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the jets were identified to originate from @xmath20 quarks using secondary vertex ( sv ) and neural network ( nn ) tagging algorithms .",

    "in addition to @xmath19 , a large background contribution was found to be due to qcd multijet production .",
    "for @xmath32 a sensitivity of @xmath33 was separately obtained for @xmath10 and @xmath9 production . combining both production modes",
    "the sensitivity was @xmath34 .",

    "the d0 collaboration recently presented a search in this channel based on an integrated luminosity of 0.9@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the analysis required a reconstructed @xmath36 or @xmath37 pair with a dilepton mass consistent with the @xmath1 boson mass and at least two jets which were required to be identified as @xmath20 jets using the nn tagger . for central pseudorapidities , @xmath38 , a @xmath20-tagging efficiency of 72% at a light - jet fake rate of 4%",

    "the dominant decay mode for @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath2 decays into an electron or muon are used to suppress the qcd multijet background .",
    "as the higgs boson has spin-0 , the final - state leptons are predominately produced with small azimuthal separation due to spin - correlations between them .",
    "therefore , the higgs signal can be discriminated from the electroweak production of @xmath11 boson pairs .",

    "the phenomenology at large @xmath50 ( the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ) is remarkable : the cross section for the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath51 and the associated production @xmath52 is largely enhanced and the @xmath53-odd @xmath49 boson is nearly mass - degenerate with either the light or heavy @xmath53 even state , @xmath47 or @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the leading decay modes of the two mass - degenerate states , both denoted as @xmath54 , are @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . despite the smaller branching fraction , higgs searches in the di-@xmath59 channel",

    "no signal for supersymmetry has yet been found at the tevatron and stringent limits , which are significantly improved compared to runi , were set . at the beginning of 2007 both experiments have recorded integrated luminosities exceeding 2@xmath0 and are expected to collect much larger data sets during the full period of runii .",
