    "the dissipative optomechanical coupling systems have recently attracted considerable attention . the dissipative coupling is characterized by the dependence of the cavity decay rate on the displacement of the mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "several dissipative optomechanical systems have been demonstrated experimentally , these include a microdisk resonator coupled to a vibrating nanowaveguide @xcite , a michelson  sagnac interferometer containing a moving membrane @xcite , a photonic crystal split - beam nanocavity @xcite .",
    "the dissipative coupling offers several advantages , for example , it has been shown that the dissipative coupling can lead to near ground - state cooling of the mechanical resonator in the unresolved sideband limit @xcite and the squeezing of the mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "a variety of other physical effects with dissipative coupling have been discussed : the normal mode splitting @xcite , the electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , the squeezing of the output light @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "an important application of the dissipative coupling is in the sensitive detection of the force and torque @xcite .",
    "recently , the dissipative optomechanical coupling has been shown to overcome the sql @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the sensitivity for measurement of a classical signal force acting on a free particle in a dissipative optomechanical system is comparable with that in a dispersive optomechanical system but has much wider measurement bandwidth @xcite .    in an early paper",
    "the present authors had demonstrated the great advantage of using a parametric amplifier ( pa ) in the optomechanical cavity @xcite .",
    "for example , it was that the dispersive optomechanical coupling systems with parametric amplification can aid in cooling the movable mirror @xcite and in observing the normal - mode splitting in the coupling of the movable mirror and the output field @xcite .",
    "our original suggestion @xcite has been followed by many others @xcite .    guided by these wide range of new features",
    "when the pa is in the cavity , we study the dissipative optomechanical system with a degenerate pa .",
    "it is found that the pa greatly enlarges the range of detection frequencies in which the force sensitivity is better than the sql , and largely improve the force sensitivity .",
    "we further study the effects of the mechanical damping and the mechanical thermal noise on the force sensitivity in the absence and presence of the pa .",
    "we show that the detrimental effects of the mechanical damping and the thermal noise on the force sensitivity can be significantly suppressed in the presence of the pa with a high parametric gain .",
    "for the temperature @xmath1 k , the improvement in the force sensivity can be by a factor of about 20 @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the detection force using the dispersive optomechanical system has a long history with many pioneering contributions . to realize high sensitive force measurements ,",
    "many approaches have been proposed to reduce quantum noise and surpass the sql in the force measurement .",
    "it has been shown that the force sensitivity can be improved by using a squeezed vacuum @xcite , optomechanical velocity measurement @xcite , kerr media @xcite , a dual - mechanical - resonator scheme @xcite , a signal - recycling mirror @xcite , two - tone drives @xcite , a second , auxiliary optical cavity coupled to the optomechanical cavity @xcite , a mirror - in - the - middle optomechanical system with two coupled cavity modes @xcite .",
