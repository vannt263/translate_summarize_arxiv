    "a gravitational wave ( gw ) is a time ",
    "dependent perturbation of the background space - time geometry which propagates away from the source , and which is generated by changes in the mass  energy distribution of the latter . due to the weakness of gravitation , the mathematical description of gws ,",
    "so far as detection by a remote observatory is concerned , can be very accurately accomplished by means of a _ linear approximation _ in the field equations .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 is the ( lorentzian ) background metric , the actual metric @xmath1 can be expediently split up as    @xmath2    where * x * and @xmath3 are quasi ",
    "lorentzian coordinates , and the @xmath4 are the gw perturbations .",
    "since gws will of course be observed far from their source they can be safely assumed to be _ plane _ across the detector s span . in this case",
    "only the six so called _ electric _ components , @xmath5 , of the riemann tensor associated with   are not identically zero .",
    "although general relativity theory predicts that at least four of these are zero , as explained in textbooks @xcite , alternative theories of gravity ( e.g.  brans ",
    "dicke ) are generally less restrictive see  @xcite for a complete discussion of all the possibilities .",
    "it thus appears that detection of gws is a strong experimental test on which is the theory which best describes gravity .    currently operating weber bars , as well as interferometric detectors , such as _ ligo _ and _ virgo _ , are however _ single channel _ devices ,",
    "i.e. , they can only sense _ one _ linear combination of the 5 quadrupole gw amplitudes the so called _ antenna pattern _",
    "network _ of such detectors in joint operation is thus necessary for a complete deconvolution of the gw  signal , but this poses non - trivial practical problems of analysis , because there are no two identical devices , noise characteristics change from one to the other , etc",
    ".    a simple way out of such limitation is to use a _ spherical detector _ , because this is a natural _ multimode _ , or tensor , gw antenna @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that , having spherical symmetry , an elastic solid has oscillation eigenmodes which come in _ degenerate _",
    "@xmath6-pole harmonics , the monopole ( @xmath7 ) and quadrupole ones efficiently coupling to the incoming gw  @xcite . by use of suitable sensor systems",
    "@xcite it is theoretically possible to completely _ deconvolve _ the gw signal , i.e. , to measure _ all _ six amplitudes which characterise a general metric gw  @xcite .",
    "a _ hollow _ sphere is an interesting variation of the solid one  @xcite which has a number of interesting capabilities as a gw detector , and flexibility to implement them by adjusting the thickness parameter . in this paper",
    "i intend to summarise the most relevant features of an _ ideal _ hollow spherical gw antenna ( i.e. , i will _ assume _ that it is technically possible to build a working system ) , and see what interesting physics could be done with it .",
    "as usual ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) , the solid s response to a gw excitation is given by the solution , with appropriate boundary conditions , to the partial differential equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the density and elastic lam coefficients , respectively , and    @xmath12    is the _ tidal _ gw driving density of force .",
    "the hollow sphere s response is then given by    @xmath13   \\label{eq.4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 are the oscillation eigenfrequencies of the @xmath15 eigenmode , @xmath16 are overlap coefficients and @xmath17 is the convolution between the signal @xmath18 and the detector mode .",
    "eigenmode wave functions @xmath19 are somewhat complicated functions which are calculated in detail in reference  @xcite , while the frequencies of the first two quadrupole and first monopole harmonics are plotted in figure  [ fig.1 ] for a conceivable materials and dimensions of the system .    , and the outer radius , @xmath20.,width=377 ]    the most relevant parameter characterising the solid s sensitivity to gws is the _ cross section _ for the absorption of incoming gw energy . as shown in reference  @xcite , the following formula holds for quadrupole modes :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the speed of sound in the material ,",
    "@xmath23 its poisson ratio , and @xmath24 is a dimensionless parameter associated with the @xmath25-th quadrupole mode of the hollow sphere . a plot of the first two @xmath26 s is given in figure  [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the crossing between the curves happens at @xmath27 , which means a hollow sphere is a more efficient gw energy absorber in its second mode than in the first , which favours in turn higher frequency signal reception .    , and the outer radius , @xmath20 .",
    "this plot is of course independent of the antenna s absolute size.,width=377 ]",
    "let us now briefly assess which sources of gws can be visible with a hollow spherical detector , under the ideal assumption that technological problems are solved to the effect that the detector s quantum limit has been reached . if such is the case then peak sensitivity is given by  @xcite    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a quadrupole resonance frequency , and @xmath30 is the efficiency of the coupling between mechanics and electronics in that mode ; the detector s bandwidth is @xmath31 .",
    "take for example a hollow sphere of cual , 3 metres of outer diameter and 22 centimetres thick ( @xmath32 ) , weighing 40 tons ; the first two quadrupole frequencies are then 400 and 1500 hz , respectively , and the peak sensitivity is essentially identical in both modes , reaching @xmath33 hz@xmath34 for a @xmath35 factor of 0.1 . a system like",
    "this would be able to see a millisecond burst with an amplitude of @xmath36 metres / metre , and a monochromatic signal as weak as @xmath37 metres / metre at the first resonant frequency if integrated for one year .",
    "such sensitivities would most likely enable the observations of supernova explosions in galaxies out to the virgo cluster ( at a rate of a few per year ) , and a significant sample of the galactic pulsar population .",
    "a larger detector , 6 metres in outer diameter , 25 centimetres thick , 200 tons of cual alloy , has a minimum spectral density of noise of @xmath38 hz@xmath34 at its first resonance ( 190 hz ) , and @xmath39 hz@xmath34 at the second ( 750 hz ) .",
    "such a system can be used for _ chirp _ signal detection by a robust method first described for spherical detectors by coccia and fafone  @xcite .",
    "the idea is conceptually simple : the gw signal generated e.g.  by a compact binary system nearing coalescence sweeps an ascending frequency range which eventually overlaps with the sensitivity bands of the detector .",
    "if the binary remains undisrupted  @xcite while in the frequency intervals between the first two just quoted resonances then the antenna s response will peak at those frequencies , with a signal to noise ratio given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the distance to the source , @xmath42 is a detector quadrupole resonance frequency , and @xmath43 is the _ mass parameter _    @xmath44    of the chirp signal .",
    "let now @xmath45 and @xmath46 be the times at which the the signal reaches the detector with frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the mass parameter can then be estimated by the formula    @xmath49    in which the lowest post - newtonian approximation for the waveform has been assumed  @xcite .",
    "the strong point of this _ double passage _ method is its _ robustness _ relative to the details of the signal s _ phase _",
    "@xcite , which considerably complicates the performance of the _ matched filter _ in extracting the signal from the noise in an interferometric detector  @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that both detectors , a sphere and an interferometer , can constructively cooperate in the identification of compact binary coalescences , as the sphere can provide a good estimate of the mass parameter which will simplify and enhance the efficiency of the bank of filters needed in an interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the hollow sphere is particularly suited for this , as it can be made to have low resonance frequencies , and this favours snr because the signal stays longer in the lower frequencies gravitational bremsstrahlung tends to accelerate the inspiral as the binary s period of revolution diminishes .",
    "this fact is clearly reflected by equation  , where snr is seen to strongly depend on the 7/3 inverse power of frequency .",
    "_ cosmic backgrounds _ of gws can also be observed with hollow spheres .",
    "such signals , due to their _ stochastic _ nature , are impossible to tell from the detector noise .",
    "a minimum of two detectors , whose outputs are cross - correlated , must be used in order to see a common signal which can be identified by a distinctive spectral density , @xmath50 . with unit snr",
    ", a pair of identical hollow spheres could set a good limit on the density parameter of gws in the universe  @xcite :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the integration time and @xmath53 the detector s bandwidth around @xmath54 .",
    "it has recently been conjectured by amelino - camelia  @xcite , on the basis of dimensional arguments , that a cosmic background of gws could have , in first approximation , a flat spectrum with spectral density    @xmath55    it is unclear whether this is a realistic assumption  @xcite ; if it were however it would mean that planck scale scale physics would become accessible to the next generation of gw detectors , and hollow spheres would enable the observation of such phenomena with signal to noise ratios of the order of about 100 .",
    "as already mentioned , spherical elastic bodies are natural _ multimode _ gw antennas .",
    "the reason for this is the degeneracy of their quadrupole oscillation eigenmodes , which ideally match the structure of gws . both a solid and a hollow sphere share this property , of course , and in this paper",
    "i have briefly considered some of the more interesting properties of the latter , related to its sensitivity and subsequent capabilities as a powerful gw telescope .",
    "i have deliberately left aside the issues of how it could be cast and suspended in practice , as well as questions of how a quantum limited transducer system can be coupled efficiently to the body of the antenna .",
    "the paper is thus intended to give a consistent flavour of the best performance one can possibly aim at with such a detector .",
    "there being the possibility to adjust the spherical shell s thickness , the hollow sphere is a more flexible device than a solid one to meet given specifications .",
    "in fact , recent research work  @xcite shows that it is advantageous to use a hollow and a solid sphere placed in a joint concentric layout to produce a gw detector which has enhanced sensitivity over a frequency band between the resonances of the inner solid body and the outer hollow one . by an optimised choice of the latter s thickness , and by means of optical fabry - perot cavities acting as non - resonant transducers , such",
    "a _ nested _ sphere system appears to be a promising device for gw signal detection in the khz region in bandwidths of several hundred hz , where it beats the prospects of the very sensitive earth based interferometric gw detectors . and ,",
    "let me stress this once more , all of it with the ability to potentially deconvolve the five quadrupole amplitudes with a single system .",
