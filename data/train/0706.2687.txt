    "in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , large spiral galaxies like the milky way and m31 form within extensive dark matter halos from the merging and accretion of smaller systems .",
    "although cdm models have had many successes on larger scales , one of the most serious challenges facing cdm models is the so - called `` missing satellite '' problem .",
    "first identified by  @xcite and @xcite , the problem manifests itself through the prediction by cdm models of at least 1 - 2 orders of magnitude more low - mass sub - halos at the present epoch compared to the observed abundance of dwarf galaxies surrounding the milky way and m31 .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical proposals to solve this problem .",
    "for example , the satellites that are observed could be embedded only in the rarer , more massive dark sub - halos  @xcite , or , the satellites may form only in the rare peaks of halos that were above a given mass at reionization  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "star formation in low mass systems could be inhibited by photoionization in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "all these ideas do not alter the abundance of dark matter sub - halos , but propose to solve the observed discrepancy by producing a smaller number of directly observable satellites , thus breaking any simple relationship between mass and luminosity .    the known milky way dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites have been discovered by a variety of methods .",
    "the first seven were discovered serendipitously by visual inspection of photographic plates , the sextans dsph was found using automated scans of photographic plates and the sagittarius dsph in a radial velocity survey of the milky way bulge .",
    "all - sky photographic surveys cover most of the sky away from the zone of avoidance , but searches of plates are limited to surface brightnesses of @xmath5 mag arcsec@xmath6  @xcite . the sample of known dsphs has long been bedeviled with selection effects , which are difficult to model with any accuracy .",
    "this situation has changed recently with the advent of very large area , homogeneous , photometric surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "the sdss makes it possible to carry out a systematic survey for satellite galaxies , which are detectable through their resolved stellar populations down to extremely low surface brightnesses .",
    "in essence , sdss greatly systematic searches for overdensities of stars in position - color - magnitude space .    , of the inner gaussian is 6  and of the outer gaussian is 60.,height=226 ]    @xcite carried out the first sdss  based survey for resolved milky way satellites , subsequently discovering a new dwarf galaxy , ursa major @xcite as well as an unusually large globular cluster , willman 1  @xcite .",
    "the color image `` field of streams ''  @xcite , composed of magnitude slices of the stellar density in the sdss around the north galactic cap , proved to be a treasure - trove for dwarf galaxies , as canes venatici , bootes  i and ursa major  ii  @xcite were all found in quick succession .",
    "a systematic search in the `` field of streams '' led to the discovery of five more satellite galaxies , canes venatici  ii , leo  iv , hercules , coma , and leo t , as well as another large globular cluster , segue 1  @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite discovered another low luminosity satellite , bootes  ii .",
    "as the faintest milky way satellites currently constitute our best markers of sub - halos , the faint end of the satellite luminosity function of the milky way satellites can provide stringent constraints on the process of galaxy formation , and can distinguish between a number of dark matter , structure formation and reionization models .",
    "so , it is important not merely to carry out a systematic survey of the star overdensities in sdss data for the discoveries per se , but also to compute the detection limits .",
    "these detection limits are the basis for a volume corrected luminosity function estimate and ultimately for a quantitative connection of satellite frequency and sub - halo abundance .",
    "such is the purpose of this paper .",
    "it is important to note that for a volume - corrected estimate of the luminosity function , it is not necessary to use exactly the same detection algorithms as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "similarly , the detection scheme does not need to be optimal for every individual dwarf galaxy .",
    "provided the automated algorithm is able to detect all the milky way satellites , and the completeness properties of the algorithm are quantified , an estimate of the true luminosity function can be derived .",
    "the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) covers @xmath7 of the sky , or @xmath8 square degrees around the north galactic pole .",
    "sdss imaging data are produced in five photometric bands , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the data are automatically processed through pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper have been corrected for reddening due to galactic extinction using the maps of  @xcite .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to report our results in the @xmath14 band , for which we use the transformation @xmath15 given by  @xcite .",
    "the sdss data with the source catalogs used in this paper was downloaded from the sai cas virtual observatory data center@xcite and was stored locally in the postgresql database . to perform queries rapidly on the large dataset , we used the q3c plugin for the spatial queries @xcite .",
    "all the recent sdss discoveries of dsph around the milky way , bar leo t , are not directly visible in the flux - limited images , but were detected as overdensities of resolved stars within certain magnitude and color ranges .",
    "this makes it straightforward to automate a detection method and assess its efficiency .",
    "the essence of any detection algorithm is to count the number of stars in a certain ( angular ) region on the sky , satisfying specified color and magnitude criteria , and compare the number to the background value .",
    "the excess of stars depends on the satellite s luminosity and distance . for a given luminosity",
    ", the distance fixes the number of stars brighter than the sdss limiting magnitude , which is given by an integral over the stellar luminosity function .",
    "a simple illustration of the detectability of objects with a luminosity function like that of m92 is shown in figure  [ nstars_vs_dist ] .",
    "the curves show the number of stars brighter than @xmath16 for satellites of three different absolute magnitudes .",
    "the maximal distance probed by surveys like sdss is controlled by the apparent magnitude of the brightest stars in the satellite .",
    "for intrinsically luminous objects , like cvn  i ( @xmath17 ) , we can detect stars at the tip of the red giant branch at distances of up to @xmath181mpc .",
    "however , for satellites with many fewer stars , like hercules ( @xmath19 ) , the giant branch tip is simply not populated and we can only detect objects at distances up to @xmath18300kpc .    to identify the excess number of stars associated with a satellite ,",
    "a common approach is to convolve the spatial distribution of the data with window functions or filters  .",
    "to estimate the star density on different scales , we use a gaussian of width @xmath20 , that is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the distribution of sources @xmath24    this allows us to see the stellar density distribution at different spatial scales .",
    "for example , structures with a characteristic size of 1  will be more prominent when the stellar map is convolved with a 1  kernel , and less prominent when the map is convolved with 10  and 0.1  kernels .",
    "the resulting `` blobs '' , or overdensities , can be easily identified on the differential image maps , namely @xmath25 such differential image maps are generally convolutions of the original distribution with the kernel , which is a difference of two gaussians .",
    "a one - dimensional slice of a kernel is shown in figure  [ kernel ] .",
    "when we convolve the map @xmath23 with such a kernel , we obtain an estimate of the local density minus an estimate of the local background ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this interpretation allows us to quantify the significance as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the variance of @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 under the assumption that @xmath32 and a poisson distribution of the initial set of datapoints , the variance of @xmath33 is unity .",
    "this fact allows us to use the map of @xmath33 to identify overdensities above a specified significance threshold .",

    "these are good approximations to the observed cmds of these objects .    in our simulations , we test several inner kernel sizes .",
    "the reason is that for a given distance , the kernel size gives rise to an optimum physical size of the detectable objects .",
    "for example , at a distance of 50kpc , a kernel size of @xmath70 corresponds to a physical size of @xmath7160pc . as we want our algorithm to be sensitive to objects of different sizes , we use three different inner kernel sizes , namely @xmath72 , @xmath70 and @xmath52 .",
    "an object is considered to be detected if it is above a threshold on the map convolved with at least one of the kernels ( the threshold for the @xmath51 kernel is 6.50 , for the @xmath70 kernel  5.95 and for the @xmath52 kernel  6.00 , see section  [ observ_section ] ) .",
    "we refer to this procedure as the combined kernel .",
    "this is equivalent to the algorithm used in the previous section , because the list of detections for @xmath51 , @xmath70 and @xmath52 kernels includes all the known dwarfs .",

    "the locations of the known milky way globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in this parameter space are recorded as red triangles and circles .",
    "while a number of known objects lie well within the efficiency boundary , some of the recent discoveries lie close the boundary .",
    "it is evident that there is no steady gradient in efficiency , but rather a steep boundary between detectability and non - detectability .",
    "in fact , the primary contribution to the finite - extent of the gradient visible in the figures is produced by the significant extent of the individual distance bins ( the width of the distance bins is 0.3 dex ) .",
    "the pixel size in magnitude is 0.8 , and in @xmath74 , it is 0.3 .",
    "this means that there are typically 10 objects in each bin and so we expect moderate fluctuations due to shot noise .    as the efficiency changes so quickly near the boundary , and as several objects lie close to this zone , we carried out more detailed simulations on objects similar to the known dwarfs .",
    "we created 1000 monte carlo realizations of each of the known dwarfs , and fed them into the pipeline .",
    "table  [ tab : effs_simul ] lists the derived detection efficiencies for each object .",
    "the detection efficiencies are @xmath75 50 % , with the sole exception of boo  ii , confirming our assertion that the known satellites possess high detection probabilities .    for the regime in which objects",
    "are larger than the kernel size , some of the stars belonging to the satellite are missed by the window function , and for such objects the detectability is determined by the number of stars within the window function , i.e. the surface brightness .",
    "this effect produces the surface brightness limit seen in figure  [ efficiencies_known ] . for objects smaller than the kernel size ,",
    "all the stars are within the window function regardless of the size of the objects , therefore for such objects , the detectability does nt depend on physical size , but depends only on the total number of stars , i.e. the luminosity .",
    "effect produces the rapid change in detection efficiency at fixed absolute magnitude evident in figure  [ efficiencies_known ] .",
    "these two regimes can be modeled with thresholds in surface brightness and absolute magnitude by adopting a functional form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the gaussian integral , which is defined as @xmath78 to describe the detectability in each distance bin , there are four parameters that are fitted  namely the detection thresholds in surface brightness @xmath59 and absolute magnitude @xmath58 , together with their widths @xmath79 and @xmath80 . as an illustrative example , the grey - scale map of the efficiency function @xmath81 from  eq .",

    "the limiting magnitude declines roughly linearly with the logarithm of distance .",
    "objects at the limiting magnitude have an apparent size that is smaller than the kernel size and their detection significance is reduced by the background contribution . shrinking the kernel size",
    "removes some of the background and increases the significance of fainter satellites .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 on distance for the combined kernel is not plotted , because in the top left panel of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] the combined kernel basically follow the dependence of @xmath82 kernel and in the top right panel of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] the combined kernel follow the dependence of @xmath83 kernel .",
    "this is illustrated in the top left panel of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] , where it is clear that a smaller kernel allows us to detect fainter objects . however , as the top right panel shows , this is at the expense of satellite size .",
    "larger kernels pick up more stars from extended objects and hence reach fainter surface brightness .",
    "when combining different kernels in the pipeline , the overall limits in surface brightness and absolute magnitude ( 2 , 4 , 8 , see section  [ observ_section ] ) can be approximated by the blue line in the top left panel of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] and the red line in the top right panel of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] .",
    "smaller kernels allow the detection of galaxies that are low in absolute magnitude , and larger kernels allow the detection of galaxies that are fainter in surface brightness .",
    "it is also reassuring to see that the error bars @xmath80 are of the same order as the difference in the limiting magnitude moving to a neighboring bin .",
    "we explore the effects of changing color cuts and report the results in the bottom two panels of figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] .",
    "the color cut of @xmath84 can improve slightly the magnitude limit for nearby objects by selecting turn - off stars .",
    "this improvement deteriorates rapidly as we exhaust the supply of turn - off stars . at larger distances ,",
    "red color cuts like @xmath41 are more efficient at picking up giant stars .",
    "the same effect explains the drop in @xmath59 and @xmath58 at large distances for bluish color cuts .",
    "our choice of color cut @xmath41 is conservative , mostly eliminating thin disk stars , and is , overall , the best - behaved and most robust .",
    "it also allows us to minimize the influence of metallicity and age changes in the stellar population of the satellites .",

    "we can conclude that within the dr5 footprint there are certainly no bright satellites ( either globulars or galaxies ) nearby ( @xmath85 kpc ) that have eluded discovery .",
    "however , the disrupting galaxy uma  ii  @xcite provides a clue as to the likely locations of remnants .",

    "all that has survived in the inner galaxy ( @xmath86 kpc ) is a population of globular clusters , which occupy a small region in the luminosity and size parameter space .",
    "they are predominantly old globular clusters belonging to the bulge . only the densest survive against the disruptive effects of galactic tides and shocking , which is illustrated by the apparent size bias .",
    "notice that the datapoints lie well away from the detection boundary , suggesting that the sample is complete at least within @xmath86 . moving outwards ( @xmath87 kpc ) , the globular clusters belong to the halo and may have been accreted @xcite .",

    "some of these objects are in the process of disruption , such as pal 5 and ngc 5466  @xcite .",

    "further such sparse globulars may remain undetected .",
    "beyond 30kpc , the dwarf spheroidals begin to appear .",
    "the long - known dwarfs such as draco and sculptor lie far from the boundary , in regions of the luminosity and size parameter space where the dr5 search efficiency is unity . however , all the recent sdss discoveries , such as canes venatici i , bootes and hercules , lie close to the detection boundary , where the efficiency declines rapidly from unity to zero .",
    "@xcite claimed that there is a paucity of objects with half - light radii between @xmath89pc and @xmath90pc .",
    "our calculations .",
    "if there were objects with radii between @xmath89pc and @xmath90pc , there is a broad range of parameter space in which they would have been found .",
    "although most of the new detections lie in the gray areas of the plot , the empty white regions with unit efficiency are telling us something important .",
    "there are swathes of the parameter space in which we would have detected objects if they existed .",
    "for example , there are very few bright objects ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the absence of detections of bright objects does by itself provide a strong constraint on the luminosity function of milky way satellites .",
    "there also do not appear to be any analogues of the extended , luminous star clusters found in m31 by @xcite .",
    "although sdss data may still contain evidence for further , hitherto unknown , dwarf galaxies , it is unlikely that their nature can be unambiguously established without substantial quantities of follow - up imaging .",
    "figure  [ vmax ] shows the accessible volume for galaxies of different luminosities probed by our algorithm ( which in practice is a function mostly of the luminosity ) within the sdss dr5 footprint . as the logarithm of distance scales roughly linearly with limiting magnitude ( see figure  [ mag_sb_vs_distance_kernel ] ) , so does the logarithm of the accessible volume . using this , and the fact that the sdss survey covers @xmath7 of the sky",
    ", we can convert the set of known objects into a volume corrected luminosity function .",
    "the observed luminosity function is constructed using all the well - established dwarf galaxies in dr5 , namely leo ii , draco , leo i , cvn i , boo i , hercules , uma ii , com , cvn ii , leo t , uma  i , leo  iv as well as the possible dwarf willman 1 .",
    "segue 1 is not used because it is not in dr5  @xcite , and boo  ii is not used because it is not detected with our adopted identification - pipeline parameters .",
    "all the satellites included in our calculation have a surface brightness of at least @xmath92 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "to relate the observed number of satellite galaxies in our sample to the total number of satellites in the milky way halo , it is necessary to adopt an underlying radial distribution of satellite galaxies ( see appendix ) . in a given magnitude interval ,",
    "we know the observed number of satellites within @xmath93 from figure  [ vmax ] , together with their detection efficiencies from table  [ tab : effs_simul ] . if we assume a number density law @xmath94 for the satellites , then its normalization at each magnitude interval can be fixed by integrating the density law out to @xmath95 .",
    "the total number of satellites within 280kpc ( the virial radius of the halo ) is now the integral of the density law out to this limit .",
    "figure  [ satdist_models ] shows the results of the calculation for two such density laws .",
    "the dashed line shows the luminosity function assuming the satellites are distributed in an isothermal sphere ( namely , @xmath96 ) .",
    "the solid line shows the luminosity function if the density fall - off is steeper at large radii ( @xmath97 , like navarro - frenk - white profile , although to prevent the @xmath98 profile from diverging in the mw center we use @xmath99 with the core radius @xmath100kpc ) .",
    "of course , the nature of some of the objects we have in the dwarf galaxy luminosity function is still uncertain  in particular , willman 1 may be a globular cluster , although @xcite provide evidence for a metallicity spread and dark matter content .",
    "it is unclear whether leo t should be included or excluded , as it is most likely a transition object with rather different properties from the other dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our sample .",
    "the error bars in figure  [ satdist_models ] are given by the square root of the number of datapoints in the absolute magnitude interval divided by the volume correction factor . at the bright end , the error bars are large , since we have only two objects with @xmath101 , namely leo  i ( @xmath102 ) and leo  ii ( @xmath103 ) . at the faint end ,",
    "the error bars are also large because of the substantial volume correction factor . in figure",
    "[ satdist_models ] , we show the luminosity function for satellites within 280kpc ( a proxy for a milky way virial radius @xcite ) . to define the bright end of the luminosity function , which can not be reliably determined from our data not contain dwarfs brighter than @xmath104 , we have also included in figure  [ satdist_models ] the estimate of the luminosity function ( filled points ) for the bright satellites of the milky way sampled over , together with the bright m31 satellites within 280kpc from @xcite . in figure",
    "[ satdist_models ] , we also overplot the power - law function @xmath105 , which approximates the datapoints in the range of @xmath106 ( with probably some flattening at @xmath107 ) .",
    "the integration of this power - law gives approximately 45 dwarfs brighter than -5.0 , and 85 dwarfs brighter than -2.0 .",
    "there are a number of theoretical predictions of the luminosity function of the local group in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite shows the results of semi - analytic galaxy formation calculations , including the effects of supernova feedback and photoionization . the luminosity function from @xcite for @xmath108 @xcite",
    "are plotted with blue line in figure  [ satdist_models ] .",
    "although the numbers of luminous satellites are in reasonable agreement with the data , the shape of the luminosity function is not .",
    "all somerville s ( 2002 ) luminosity functions turn over at @xmath109 or brighter , depending on the epoch of reionization , whereas the luminosity function derived in figure  [ satdist_models ] turns over fainter than @xmath110 , if at all .",
    "therefore , somerville s ( 2002 ) theoretical calculations overproduce draco - like objects ( @xmath111 ) by a factor of a few , and underproduce much fainter galaxies like boo ( @xmath112 ) by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite also provides calculations of the luminosity function of the milky way satellites , including the effects of tidal disruption as well as photoionization .",
    "they report the luminosity functions for dwarfs with a range of of different central surface brightness cuts , namely @xmath113 and @xmath114 mag arcsec@xmath6 , the last of which is plotted in figure  [ satdist_models ] in a red line . at first glance , the fit seems plausible , especially given the size of the error bars on the datapoints .",
    "the turn over in benson et al.s luminosity function is at @xmath115 and the numbers of predicted satellites at faint magnitudes are also consistent given the uncertainties .",
    "however , benson et al.s model significantly underproduces the number of bright satellites .",
    "additionally , benson et al.s satellites have a much higher central surface brightness  our sdss survey corresponds to a surface brightness cut of @xmath116 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite does show the luminosity function for all objects , irrespective of surface brightness .",
    "although there has been a large change in the luminosity function on moving from a detection threshold of @xmath117 to @xmath114 mag arcsec@xmath6 , there is only a small change on moving from @xmath114 to @xmath118 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "there have been persistent discrepancies between the observed numbers of milky way satellites and the predictions from numerical simulations of galaxy formation for a number of years .",
    "although here has been a cavalcade of discoveries of new milky way satellites using the sdss over the last two years , a systematic search  with quantifiable detection limits and efficiencies  not been undertaken . in this paper",
    "we have presented a quantitative search methodology for milky way satellite galaxies in sdss data and have used this method to detection efficiency maps , which ultimately allow the construction of the satellite galaxy luminosity function .    in our method ,",
    "the star count map is convolved with a family of kernels which are the difference of two gaussians .",
    "intuitively , this algorithm can be understood as constructing an estimate of the local stellar density minus the background . by attaching a statistical significance to the overdensities in the convolved image ,",
    "this enables us to construct a ranked list of candidates .",
    "although this idea is simple enough , its practical application is hampered by the fact that the separation between stars and galaxies by the sdss pipeline becomes unreliable at magnitudes fainter than @xmath119 .",
    "the resulting false positives must be removed by cross - correlating with galaxy catalogs .",
    "the significance threshold of peaks in our survey is set by requiring the detection pipeline to produce a `` clean '' list of milky way satellites .    to compute the detection efficiency ,",
    "we create mock sdss catalogs with stars from simulated dwarf galaxies and use monte carlo methods to estimate recovery as a function of satellite galaxy parameters and heliocentric distance .",
    "there is a sharp boundary between detectability and non - detectability .",
    "the efficiency maps make clear that there are large domains in parameter space in which objects would have been detected had they existed . in particular , even at heliocentric distances as great as 1mpc , objects brighter than @xmath120 would have been detectable in sdss .",
    "similarly , populations of extended , luminous star clusters would have been found in sdss , if they existed in the milky way .    with the efficiency in hand",
    ", we can  for the first time ",
    "correct the observed luminosity function of the milky way satellites for selection effects and compute the true luminosity function .",
    "the number density of satellite galaxies continues to rise well below @xmath121 ; depending on the radial distribution model assumed it may or may not flatten or turn over at @xmath122 .",
    "overall , the luminosity function of _ all _ milky way satellites may be reasonably well described by a power - law , @xmath123 from @xmath4 to -18 .",
    "this power - law predicts @xmath18 45 satellites brighter than @xmath124 , and @xmath1885 satellites brighter than @xmath4 .",
    "the normalization of the luminosity function is in reasonable agreement with the predictions of semi - analytic modeling of galaxy formation , but the shape is not . there also remains a discrepancy in the distribution of surface brightnesses of such objects , in the sense that the semi - analytic models underproduce dwarfs with a central surface brightness fainter than @xmath114 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
