    "consider a thermodynamic system with two coexisting phases and imagine to prepare it in an initial condition where a droplet of one phase is immersed in the other phase .",
    "if the system undergoes a dynamics that does not conserve the order parameter , it is well understood phenomenologically @xcite that the droplet will shrink in order to decrease its surface tension until it eventually disappears , and that ( roughly speaking ) the normal speed at a point of its boundary will be proportional to the local mean curvature .",
    "deriving such behavior from first principles , i.e.  from a microscopic model undergoing a local ( stochastic ) dynamics , is a much harder task and this program was started only rather recently @xcite .",
    "more precisely , what one expects is that , if the initial droplet is of diameter @xmath7 , it will `` disappear '' within a time of order @xmath8 ( this behavior is sometimes referred to as `` lifshitz law '' ) .",
    "moreover , in the `` diffusive limit '' where @xmath9 and at the same time space is rescaled by @xmath7 ( so that the initial droplet is of size @xmath12 ) and time is accelerated by @xmath8 , the droplet evolution should become deterministic and follow some anisotropic version of a mean curvature flow .",
    "anisotropy ( i.e.  the fact that the normal velocity will also depend on the local orientation of the droplet boundary ) is expected when the underlying model is defined on a lattice , as will be the case for us",
    ".    up to now , mathematical progress on this issue has been rather modest , the main difficulty being that it is not clear how to implement the idea that the fast modes related to relaxation inside the two pure phases should decouple from slow modes related to the interface motion , which are responsible for the diffusive time scaling @xmath8 .",
    "a fairly well understood situation is that where the interface can be described by a height function and the bulk structure of the two phases is disregarded .",
    "this is possible ( by definition ) for the so - called `` effective interface models '' or ginzburg - landau @xmath13 interface models : for models with continuous heights and strictly convex potential undergoing a langevin - type dynamics , funaki and spohn @xcite derived the full mean - curvature motion in the diffusive scaling .",
    "another well - studied case is that of models with kac - type potentials : in this case , mean - curvature motion can be proven to emerge @xcite in a limit where interaction range is taken to infinity at some stage , but in this limit there is no sharp interface separating the phases and the system becomes very close to mean - field .    as for true lattice models ,",
    "results are much more scarce .",
    "for instance , for the two - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model below the critical temperature , the best known upper bound on the `` disappearance time '' for a droplet of `` @xmath10 phase '' immersed in the `` @xmath14 phase '' is of the order @xmath15 @xcite , very far from the expected @xmath8 scaling .",
    "recently , a weak version of the lifshitz law was proven for the three - dimensional ising model at zero temperature : the disappearance time of a `` @xmath10 '' droplet is of order @xmath8 ( upper and lower bounds ) , up to multiplicative logarithmic ( in @xmath7 ) corrections @xcite . when the dimension is higher than three ( always at zero temperature ) , an _ upper bound _ for the disappearance time of order @xmath16 , for some constant @xmath17 , was proven in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we concentrate on the two - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model on the infinite square lattice .",
    "the dynamics takes a very simple form : each spin is updated with rate one and after the update it takes the same value as the majority of its neighbors , or the value @xmath18 with equal probabilities if exactly two neighbors are `` @xmath14 '' and two are `` @xmath10 '' . in this case , the disappearance time of a large `` @xmath10 '' droplet should be asymptotically given by one half its volume ( number of `` @xmath10 '' spins ) .",
    "moreover , in the diffusive scaling limit the droplet boundary should be given by a deterministic curve @xmath19 whose normal speed is given by the local ( signed ) curvature , times a function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angle of the local normal vector .",
    "the function @xmath22 is explicitly known , see . in this two - dimensional setting , it is more natural to refer to such flow as `` ( anisotropic ) curve - shortening flow '' ( rather than `` mean curvature flow '' ) .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ th : convex ] ) is a proof of the curve - shortening conjecture ( and , as a byproduct , of the lifshitz law ) when the initial droplet is convex .",
    "there are some previous partial results available on this problem .",
    "the scaling limit of the evolution when initially spins are `` @xmath10 '' in the first quadrant of @xmath23 ( infinite corner ) and `` @xmath14 '' elsewhere is described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) ( with the language of exclusion processes rather than spin systems ) .",
    "this is a simple situation because the interface motion is mapped to symmetric simple exclusion and is described by the associated height function at all times . in @xcite , spohn described the scaling limit of the interface motion in a situation that more or less corresponds to the zero - temperature ising model in an infinite vertical cylinder , with an initial condition such that the interface separating `` @xmath14 '' from `` @xmath10 '' spins can be globally described by a height function at all times ( in particular , this can not describe a droplet , and implicitly he has to modify the dynamics to guarantee that droplets do not appear later in the evolution ) . in @xcite , chayes _",
    "_ proved the lifshitz law ( but not the curve - shortening conjecture ) for a modified dynamics where updates which break the droplet into several droplets are forbidden . in @xcite ,",
    "cerf and louhichi computed the `` drift at time @xmath24 '' of the droplet ( for the non - modified dynamics ) , but their result does not allow to get information on the evolution for finite time @xmath25 .",
    "an important building block of our proof of the anisotropic curve - shortening conjecture is that , as was well understood by spohn in @xcite , locally the interface can be ( roughly speaking ) described by the hydrodynamic limit of a certain zero - range process at the points where the tangent to the boundary is horizontal or vertical , and by the hydrodynamic limit of the symmetric simple exclusion process elsewhere .",
    "however , such correspondence is not exact due to updates that split the droplet into more than one connected components ( see for instance figure [ fig : interditmove ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the interface is not ( even locally ) the graph of a function . also , it is a non - trivial task to patch together the various pieces of `` local analysis '' to control globally the evolution of the droplet .",
    "both problems will be tamed by a sequence of monotonicity arguments , which are allowed because the dynamics conserves the stochastic ordering among configurations .    in order to prove theorem [ th : convex ] , we also need to know that a classical solution to the anisotropic curve - shortening flow exists up to the time where the droplet disappears , and ( crucially ) that such solution is sufficiently regular in space and time ( i.e.  that the curvature is a lipschitz function of the angle and a continuous function of time ) . to our surprise",
    ", we found that the existing literature on curve - shortening flows does not provide global ( in time ) results for the flow associated to the zero - temperature 2d ising model .",
    "the reason is that the anisotropy function @xmath22 is not smooth ( its derivative has jumps , reflecting the singularities of the surface tension at zero temperature ) , while the existing results assume that @xmath22 is at least @xmath26 , cf .",
    "@xcite . to prove existence , uniqueness and regularity of the solutions ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : deterministico ] ) , we will regularize the function @xmath22 and then analyze the regularized flow following the ideas of @xcite . of course",
    ", it will be crucial to guarantee that all the estimates we need are uniform in the regularization parameter , which tends to zero in the end .",
    "the case where the initial `` @xmath10 '' droplet is non - convex will be considered in future work .",
    "the additional difficulties are two - fold .",
    "first of all , from the analytic point of view , available global existence and regularity results for the solution of curve - shortening flows with non - convex initial condition seem to be limited to the isotropic case where @xmath27 @xcite . secondly , due to the fact that the droplet will move at the same time outwards and inwards at different locations according to the sign of the curvature , various monotonicity arguments we use in the rest of the paper will not work .",
    "set @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the zero - temperature stochastic ising model on @xmath29 with its usual lattice structure ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are linked if @xmath32 for the @xmath33 norm ) .",
    "this is a continuous time markov chain @xmath34 on the space of spin configurations on @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",

    "when the spin at a site is updated , it takes the same value as the spin of the majority of its neighbors , or the values @xmath42 with equal probabilities @xmath43 if two neighbors have `` @xmath14 '' spins and the other two `` @xmath10 '' spins . that these rules yield a well - defined markov chain even in infinite volume",

    "@xcite ) . in",
    "what follows ( cf .  )",
    ", we will consider only initial conditions where the number of `` @xmath10 '' spins is finite .",
    "it is easy to realize that the spins outside the smallest square containing all the initial `` @xmath10 '' spins stay `` @xmath14 '' forever , so that in reality we have a dynamics on a finite volume and the question of existence of the process is trivial .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of the set of `` @xmath10 '' spins for this markov chain when the initial condition @xmath44 is a large droplet , i.e.a finite connected set of `` @xmath10 '' spins surrounded by `` @xmath14 '' spins . in that case , almost surely , after a finite time @xmath45 , all the `` @xmath10 '' spins have turned to `` @xmath14 '' and the dynamics will stay forever in the all `` @xmath14 '' configuration ( which is an absorbing state ) . our aim is to describe the evolution of the shape of the rescaled `` @xmath10 '' droplet on a proper ( diffusive ) time - scale . in the next paragraph",
    "we make that aim more precise .",
    "we consider a compact , simply connected subset @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] whose boundary is a closed smooth curve .",
    "given @xmath47 we consider the markov chain described above with initial condition @xmath48 in order to see a set of `` @xmath10 '' spins as a subset of @xmath1 , each vertex @xmath49 may be identified with the closed square of side - length one centered at @xmath30 , @xmath50 ^ 2.\\ ] ] one defines @xmath51 which is the `` @xmath10 droplet '' at time @xmath52 for the dynamics .",
    "the boundary of @xmath53 is a union of edges of @xmath54 ( this is the only reason why we defined the ising model on @xmath55 ) .",
    "what was conjectured by lifshitz @xcite on heuristic grounds for the low temperature ising model is that @xmath53 should follow an anisotropic curve shortening motion : after rescaling space by @xmath7 and time by @xmath8 and letting @xmath7 tend to infinity , the motion of the interface between @xmath53 and its complement should be deterministic and the local drift of the interface should be proportional to the curvature , with an anisotropic correction to reflect anisotropy of the underlying lattice .",
    "more precisely , one can formulate this conjecture as follows @xcite : let @xmath56 denote the boundary of the ( random ) set @xmath57 .",
    "then , for @xmath9 , @xmath56 should converge to a deterministic curve @xmath19 and the evolution of @xmath58 should be such that the normal velocity at a point @xmath59 is given by the curvature at @xmath30 , times an anisotropic factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the slope of the outwards directed normal to @xmath19 at @xmath30 . the velocity is directed inwards at points where @xmath19 is convex and outwards at points where it is concave .",
    "the function @xmath22 should have the explicit expression @xmath62 in particular , the curve @xmath19 should shrink to a point in a finite time @xmath63    note that the function @xmath22 is symmetric around @xmath24 and is periodic with period @xmath64 , which reflects the discrete symmetries of the lattice @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to note for the following that @xmath22 is @xmath65 except at @xmath66 where it is only continuous and its first derivative has a jump : indeed , @xmath67 for @xmath21 close to @xmath68 .",
    "we prove the anisotropic curve shortening conjecture in the case where the initial droplet is convex and suitably smooth . given a strictly convex smooth domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 and letting @xmath69 be its boundary , we parameterize it following a standard convention of convex geometry ( cf .",
