    "the standard cosmology is based on the assumption that the universe must be homogeneous on very large scales .",
    "several pieces of evidence support this assumption : the homogeneity and isotropy of the microwave background radiation @xcite and some aspects of the large scale distribution of matter @xcite seem to strongly advocate uniformity on scales bigger than about @xmath2 mpc ( where @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 )",
    ".    however the presence of very large features in the galaxy distribution like the bootes void @xcite or the great wall @xcite which span a scale length of the order of @xmath5 mpc calls the actual scale of homogeneity into question .",
    "moreover other authors consider the assumption of homogeneity just a theoretical prejudice not necessarily supported by the observational evidence quoted above .",
    "they defend the alternative idea of an unbounded fractal cosmology @xcite .",
    "guzzo ( 1997 ) argues against this interpretation on the basis of a careful handling of the data .",
    "the spatial two  point correlation function is the statistical tool mainly used to describe the clustering in the universe ( peebles 1980 , 1993 ) . however , because of the integral constraint @xcite , one can not estimate it at very large distances from the currently available redshift surveys . in order to study clustering in the regime where it is not very strong , we have only two possibilities : either we extend the size of the redshift catalogues or we use alternative statistical descriptors . the approach described in this paper points in the latter direction . in the same line ,",
    "other authors @xcite have tried to measure the power ",
    "spectrum on large scales directly from galaxy catalogues .",
    "einasto & gramman ( 1993 ) studied the transition to homogeneity by means of the power  spectrum and found a relation between the correlation transition scale and the spectral transition scale ( turnover in @xmath6 ) .",
    "we introduce the quantity called @xmath7 , which is related to the correlation function @xmath8 .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies essentially in the fact that we shall use a cumulant quantity instead of a differential quantity such as @xmath8 .",
    "although for a point process the functions @xmath8 and @xmath7 are well defined , what we measure from the galaxy catalogues are just estimators of those functions .",
    "one of our main claims is that the estimators for @xmath7 are more reliable than the most currently used estimators for @xmath8 and that makes its use recommendable ( especially in three - dimensional processes and at large scales ) despite its somewhat less informative character .",
    "within the field of the statistical analysis of point fields , new techniques and estimators of the clustering of spatial point patterns have been developed in the past decades .",
    "unfortunately , the connection between this set of scholars and cosmologists is not as important today as it was in the late fifties when the berkeley statisticians neymann and scott carried out an intensive programme about the analysis of the lick catalogue ( neymann & scott 1952 , 1955 ) .",
    "today , one of the most popular summary statistics for point patterns is the @xmath0function ( bartlett 1964 , ripley 1976 , 1977 , 1981 ) .",
    "let us introduce this quantity using the terminology employed by statisticians and stressing its connections with the quantities used in cosmology ( see also szapudi & szalay 1997 for a different application of ripley s statistic to cosmology ) .",
    "let us consider a point process acting on a region @xmath9 with volume @xmath10 whose output is a collection of positions of @xmath11 galaxies ( or clusters of galaxies ) \\{@xmath12}. if we take two infinitesimal volumes @xmath13 and @xmath14 around @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , the joint probability of there being a point lying in each of these volumes reads : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the so - called second order intensity function @xcite .",
    "if the process is stationary ( invariant under translation ) and isotropic ( invariant under rotation ) , then @xmath19 .",
    "the two - point correlation function can be expressed by means of it as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the mean number density in a fair sample .",
    "the second  order cumulative function @xmath7 is defined so that the expected number of neighbours a given galaxy will have at a distance less than @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore its relation with the two  point correlation function is    @xmath25    for a homogeneous poisson process this function is just    @xmath26      other second  order cumulant functions have been used in the statistical analysis of the large scale structure in the universe . within the context of the scaling or multifractal approach the partition function @xmath27 introduced in the description of the galaxy clustering by martnez et al .",
    "( 1990 ) is formally related with @xmath7 for the second moment @xmath28 by @xmath29 where @xmath10 is the volume of the sample .",
    "borgani et al .",
    "( 1994 ) perform an exhaustive analysis of the cluster distribution in both real catalogues of clusters of galaxies and simulations by means of the @xmath27 function . in that paper",
    "the authors give an expression for using this partition function when a selection function has to be considered .",
    "the dependence of the results of @xmath27 of the particular volume of the sample has led some authors ( domnguez  tenreiro , gmez  flechoso and martnez 1994 ) to normalize @xmath30 in order to get a function @xmath31 which coincides for different samples ( within different volumes ) in the homogeneous regime .",
    "basically this normalization makes @xmath32 equivalent to @xmath7 .",
    "peebles ( 1980 ) introduced the moments of the counts of neighbours @xmath33 as the mean count of objects in balls of radius @xmath23 excluding the central one . by definition @xmath33",
    "is the correlation integral @xmath34 used by martnez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in the analysis of the multiscaling properties of the matter distribution and is related with @xmath7 simply by @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , other authors ( martnez & coles 1994 ; mccauley 1997 ) have chosen the normalization for the partition function @xmath27 in such a way that @xmath36 directly .",
    "taking the shape of the @xmath0 function for a random object distribution ( poisson process ) into account , one can just consider the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath37 which leads to another cumulant quantity commonly used in the statistical description of the galaxy clustering , @xmath38 , where ( peebles 1980 , 1993 ) @xmath39    finally , if one considers the quotient instead of the difference , one gets the integral quantity used by coleman & pietronero ( 1992 ) :    @xmath40    ( see also cappi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a discussion on the methods used by pietronero and collaborators ) .",
    "the advantages of the use of @xmath7 with respect to other cumulant quantities are the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is well normalized .",
    "we can compare directly the @xmath0 function of different samples , with different number density and within different volumes without extra normalization .",
    "2 .   @xmath7 is a well  known quantity in the field of spatial statistics and several analytical results regarding its shape and variance are already available for a variety of point processes .",
    "it is very important to estimate the quantity @xmath7 directly from the data and not through numerical integration of @xmath41 , which introduces artificial smoothing of the results .",
    "several edge  corrected unbiased estimators are available for @xmath7 . in the context of the present application , the most appreciable properties an estimator must hold are to have little variance and not to introduce spurious homogeneity by means of the edge  correction . in the next subsection we comment on different estimators for @xmath7 .",
    "we shall make the assumption that the process under consideration is stationary and isotropic .",
    "such a process is also referred to as ` statistically homogeneous ' @xcite .",
    "note , however , that when in this paper we talk about ` the scale of homogeneity ' , we mean the scale at which the spatial distribution of the objects is uniform or indistinguishable from a homogeneous poisson process . nevertheless , some cluster processes are still stationary and isotropic .    there exist several estimators for @xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of some of them can be found in doguwa & upton ( 1989 ) . from the definition of @xmath0 and ignoring the edge effects",
    "one could consider the following naive estimator @xmath42 where @xmath43 is heaviside s step function , whose value is 1 when the argument is positive and 0 otherwise .",
    "obviously for a finite sample this estimator will provide values for @xmath0 smaller than the true values since neighbours outside the boundaries are not considered .",
    "one possible solution is to consider only points in an inner region as centres of the balls for counting neighbours .",
    "the points lying in the outer region , a buffer zone ( upton & fingleton 1987 ; buchert & martnez 1993 ) , take part in the estimator just as points which could be seen as neighbours at a given distance @xmath23 of the points in the inner region .",
    "the inner region might shrink as @xmath23 increases .",
    "however , this solution leads to biases ( the sample is not uniformly selected ) , wastes a lot of data , and obviously increases the variance of the estimator @xcite . the standard solution adopted in the statistical studies of the large ",
    "scale structures is to account for the unseen neighbours outside the sample window by means of the following edge  corrected estimator @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fraction of the volume of the sphere of radius @xmath23 centred on the object @xmath46 which falls within the boundaries of the sample .",
    "this kind of edge  correction has been used by borgani et al .",
    "( 1994 ) when calculating the partition function @xmath27 used in the multifractal analysis . in the field of spatial statistics",
    "it had been introduced by doguwa and upton ( 1989 ) .",
    "although this estimator has good properties , it could be slightly biased @xcite . the most commonly used unbiased edge ",
    "corrected estimator in the analysis of point processes is ripley s estimator , which under our hypotheses reads @xcite : @xmath47 where the weight @xmath48 is an edge correction equal to the proportion of the _ area _ of the sphere centred at @xmath12 and passing through @xmath49 that is contained in @xmath50 ; in other words , @xmath48 is the conditional probability that the @xmath51th point is observed given that it is at a distance @xmath23 from the @xmath46th point .",
    "this correction is suitable for stationary and isotropic processes and is illustrated in fig .",
    "the unweighted @xmath0 function will be negatively biased because we do not observe events outside the sampling window , so the observed counts from events which are less than a distance @xmath23 from the boundary will be artificially low .",
    "it is still possible that the best estimator depends of the kind of point process to be studied ( clustered or regular ) and even on the particular scale range , ( see stoyan & stoyan ( 1998 ) for a discussion on improved estimators ) .",
    "we have chosen the estimator @xmath52 because of its well known good performance in a variety of cases .    in baddeley",
    "et al . ( 1993 ) an analytic expression for @xmath48 is given in the case @xmath50 is a cube . in order to ensure that the border correction is as free of error as possible , we have chosen to generate the synthetic samples we want to analyse in a region shaped in this way .",
    "note however that we introduce a certain bias when we estimate @xmath22 through @xmath53 but we are , on the other hand , making full use of all sample points .",
    "for all the mentioned estimators it is possible to build the corresponding versions for flux ",
    "limited samples by simply adding a weighting factor representing the selection function .      if scaling of the first moment of the count of neighbours holds , then @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath7 as well , since @xmath22 is constant when looking at the whole region .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 is known as the correlation dimension and it tends to 3 on the scale @xmath23 at which homogeneity is reached , hence its importance .",
    "once we compute @xmath0 , we obtain the local dimension @xmath1 as the slope of a five - point log - log linear regression on the function @xmath7 ( as in borgani et al .",
    "this local correlation dimension can be considered as a _ sliding window _",
    "estimate ( through the scale ) of the fractal dimension @xcite . any long plateau for",
    "a significant range of scales will be the fingerprint of a fractal range .",
    "the tendency to homogeneity will be described by an increasing behaviour of the local dimension @xmath1 as a function of the scale , towards the value consistent with homogeneity @xmath55 .",
    "this test is much stronger than just to fit a straight line to a log  log plot , which could lead to wrongly interpret as fractals sets which clearly are not , as we show in section 5.3 ( see also stoyan 1994 , mccauley 1997 ) .",
    "in order to test the usefulness of the statistic @xmath0 and the accuracy of its estimator [ equation ( [ estim ] ) ] we have calculated @xmath0 and @xmath1 for three different point samples .",
    "they are controllable point processes for which we have some _ a priori _ knowledge of the expected behaviour of the @xmath0 function . in order to compute as well the deviations from this theoretical behaviour",
    "when the empirical value is obtained on a point sample , we have analysed several realizations of each process , simulated in a cube of side 300  @xmath56 mpc .",

    "we do the same with spheres of radius @xmath60 .",
    "we repeat this @xmath61 times and consider the centres of the @xmath62 spheres in the last level as our study objects .",
    "although soneira & peebles ( 1978 ) add up @xmath63 realizations of this kind , we simply generate one , which is known to be a single fractal @xcite .",
    "the model is included inside a cube of side @xmath64 mpc .",
    "the values of the parameters we have chosen are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and we have not allowed spheres in the same level to overlap . the expected value of @xmath1 can be analytically calculated for this model through the relation @xmath68 and , for this choice of the parameters , it turns out to be @xmath69 .",
    "we have generated 10 of such samples .",
    "\\iii ) voronoi sample .",
    "essentially it is built @xcite by choosing points at random as centres of the cells of a voronoi tessellation , which is produced by drawing planes equidistant to the nearest centres .",
    "then a certain amount of objects ( events of the point process ) following a gaussian distribution are put on and around the filaments which result of the intersection of two of those planes .",
    "we have analysed 5 realizations containing around 2500 points each .",
    "all these point processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ cubes ] and now we shall comment on the results of the @xmath0function for the first three point processes , which are graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ kppfig ] . for each sample , we plot the average of the function @xmath7 calculated over the 10 realizations in the range of scales [ 10 , 100 ] @xmath56 mpc , except for the voronoi sample , which begins at @xmath70 mpc .",
    "we plot the corresponding standard deviation as error bars .",
    "these are usually smaller than the size of the dot , probing thus the stability of the estimator .",
    "the dotted line represents the theoretical behaviour for a poisson process .",
    "let us mention that the depth up to which a statistic can be reliably calculated depends on the statistic itself and on the estimator used as well as on the geometry of the region . in our case , we have calculated @xmath7 for @xmath71\\,h^{-1}$ ] mpc and it follows the same trend as in the shorter interval [ 10,100 ] @xmath56 mpc that we have plotted , except for more significant noise at very small scales . on the top of each panel we show the local dimension @xmath1 calculated as stated in section 2 .",
    "note that we do not calculate @xmath1 basing ourselves on the @xmath0 of each individual sample but on the average @xmath0 of all the samples of a same process .",

    ", we have checked that the lack of border correction ( i.e. , if we take @xmath73 ) would underestimate significantly the amount of clustering , giving a false sense of regularity in the data .    let us first point out that @xmath0 has fully accomplished its mission as a detector of the scale of homogeneity . for the poisson distribution",
    "we see that the estimator of @xmath7 matches quite well the expected behaviour of equation ( [ kpois ] ) .",
    "moreover the value of the local dimension is nearly constant for the whole range of scales and @xmath74 , with little fluctuations at small scales due to the small number of points .",
    "the other two models clearly show clustering , since the function @xmath75 .",
    "note that homogeneity begins to be reached when the @xmath0 curve of the sample falls on the theoretical straight line .",
    "the simple s - p clump is a pure fractal and hence it never reaches homogeneity ; on the plot , this corresponds to the fact that the sample and theoretical lines do not coincide over the whole range of scales , being both straight lines with different slopes .",
    "the local dimension @xmath1 as a function of the scale @xmath23 is practically a horizontal line at the theoretically predicted height , @xmath76 .",
    "this plateau is the fingerprint of fractal behaviour .",
    "the lacunarity of this fractal set , appreciated in fig .",
    "1 , is responsible for the important error bars in the plot of @xmath1 . for larger values of @xmath23 the estimates of @xmath0 and hence of @xmath1 are biased by the edge correction , which assumes that the process is stationary and isotropic .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath77 @xmath56 mpc they give the correct result although the point process does not fulfill the required assumptions , showing that the method does _ not _ introduce spurious homogenization .",
    "the different prescriptions used to generate the analysed point processes are reflected in the different shapes of @xmath0 and in the behaviour of @xmath1 as a function of the scale . the voronoi model used here is based on the population of the filaments ; this can be seen in the fact that , for the smallest scales shown in the plot ( @xmath78 @xmath56 mpc ) , the dimension @xmath76 , corresponding to filamentary  like structures . at large scales we can appreciate a continuous variation of the local dimensionality from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , corresponding to the scale at which homogeneity is reached ( @xmath81 @xmath56 mpc ) .",

    "this might be a good probe in order to test a possible fractal character of the geometry of the universe .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the mdm model and @xmath87cdm have a similar effect with respect to the standard cdm , namely the increase of the amount of clustering at all scales and the delay of the achievement of homogeneity ( @xmath80 ) .",

    "labini 1996 ) , we are able to detect a decrease in the amount of clustering through the use of the local dimension @xmath1 , which goes from 1.8 at scales around 1 @xmath56 mpc to 2.3 at scales around 20 @xmath56 mpc . in order to go beyond 20 @xmath56 mpc we have to analyse the other deeper samples .    at small scales the values of @xmath0 for the stromlo ",
    "apm sample are noisier due to the sparseness of the sample . in the range [ 525 ] @xmath56 mpc ,",
    "however , where the estimates are more reliable , there is a reasonable agreement among the results for the three samples .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is a kind of continuity between the @xmath1 values for the three optical samples .",
    "one can form an increasing curve which begins at small scales sampled by cfa80 with a value @xmath127 , joins the value @xmath128 of pps at intermediate scales and finally approaches the homogeneity value @xmath129 with apm ( which is the deepest sample ) , ruling out the idea of an unbounded fractal universe .",
    "this result is in agreement with a recent paper by scaramella el at .",
    "( 1998 ) in which they found evidences for a @xmath130 dimensionality for the eso slice project redshift survey and the abell ( aco ) clusters , using , as we do , comovil cosmological distances and @xmath0corrections .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by wu , lahav & rees ( 1998 ) from the analysis of the x - ray background and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the increasing value of @xmath1 with the scale is less evident , although appreciable , for the pps sample , in which the behaviour is a smooth increasing trend with oscillations that might be misinterpreted as a constant . in any case , it is interesting to remark that this survey has been selected to isolate one strong feature in the local universe ( iovino et al .",
    "1993 ) , the perseus ",
    "pisces supercluster , a very big sheet  like structure , which contributes strongly to values close to @xmath131 for the correlation dimension .",
    "however , as we have seen with the other analysed samples , this behaviour is particular of this sample due to a selection effect , and can not be extrapolated to the whole universe .",
    "here we have analysed separately both galactic hemispheres by means of the @xmath0 function . in fig .",
    "[ kiras ] we see significant differences between the @xmath0 function of the north and the south samples up to 20 @xmath56 . the clustering seems stronger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern one .",
    "this result corroborates the findings of kerscher et al .",
    "these authors found differences in the strength of the clustering between both hemispheres by means of the minkowski functional and nearest  neighbour distributions .",
    "also at small scales the values of @xmath0 are typically larger for the _ iras _ 1.2 jy sample than for the optical samples analysed previously .",
    "this result is in full agreement with the estimates of the correlation function at small scales reported in fisher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , bonometto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and loveday et al .",
    "however , at larger scales the @xmath0 functions of both hemispheres approach in the same way the curve corresponding to a uniform poissonian distribution .",
    "one way of measuring the errors on the estimates of a statistical function such as @xmath7 is based on the dispersion of its measures when applied to ensembles of artificial catalogues having similar statistical properties ( fisher et al .",
    "1993 ; hamilton 1993 ) .",
    "the segment cox processes @xcite are quite useful in this context .",
    "the particular model of cox process ( see also pons  bordera et al .",
    "1998 ) used here has been generated in the following way : we scatter randomly in the space segments of length @xmath132 , with @xmath133 being the mean number of segments per unit volume and , on those segments , we randomly distribute points so that a chosen @xmath134 be the mean number of points per unit length of the segments . the intensity of this process will be @xmath135 and , as proven in stoyan , kendall & mecke ( 1995 ) , its @xmath0 function will be given by :    @xmath136    and one will be able to calculate @xmath1 analytically simply as :    @xmath137    we have generated 10 such cox processes containing between 1400 and 1600 points each inside a cube of side 100 @xmath56 mpc .",
    "the values we have taken for the parameters are @xmath138 .    in fig .",
    "[ kcoxfig ] we can see the average empirical values of the estimates of @xmath7 obtained by means of equation ( [ estim ] ) together with the standard deviations . the expected theoretical function given by equation ( [ kcox ] ) is depicted as a solid line .",
    "as we can see , an empirical estimate of @xmath0 calculated on 10 cox processes reproduces quite satisfactorily the expected theoretical behaviour .",
    "note that the variance of the number of counts in a bounded set for a cox process is always bigger than in a poisson process having the same intensity @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the border correction has not destroyed the goodness of the estimator ; in particular , it has not introduced spurious homogeneization .",
    "our estimator has worked successfully not only in the `` easy '' case of absence of structure which represent poisson processes but it has also been able to reproduce quite exactly the very precise value of @xmath0 for a clustered cox process .",
    "this test gave us enough confidence to believe that the @xmath0 results obtained from the galaxy samples effectively reflect the structure existing there .",
    "the cox processes used here also play an interesting role .",
    "they are a good example with which to prevent the naive use of fractals in the analysis of point fields as it has been anticipated by stoyan ( 1994 ) . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ kcoxfig ] , we can see the function @xmath8 expected for this process .",
    "the function is the sum of two power ",
    "laws @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 . at short distances",
    "the first power ",
    "law dominates and therefore the function @xmath8 can be nicely fitted to a power ",
    "law @xmath142 with @xmath143 and this could lead to interpret that the point set is a fractal when clearly it is not ( stoyan 1994 ; mccauley 1997 ) . because in this regime @xmath144 , the same can be said for the function @xmath41 . looking at the top panel of fig .",
    "[ kcoxfig ] , we can see the behaviour of the empirical local dimension @xmath1 calculated over the average of the 10 realizations of the cox processes together with the 1 @xmath72 deviations .",
    "the solid line represents the expected theoretical values [ equation ( [ d2cox ] ) ] .",
    "again we can see the reliability of the estimates .",
    "but what it is more interesting in this example is the long plateau observed in the plot of the correlation dimension .",
    "the value @xmath145 remains nearly constant for a broad range of scales , due to the particular behaviour of the @xmath0 function for this model . after the  fractal \" behaviour , a transition to homogeneity is clearly appreciated in both @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting to remark the qualitatively similar behaviour between this figure and fig .",
    "[ koptic ] in which we showed the same function for the analysed optical redshift surveys : a regime at small scales where the clustering is strong ( with @xmath146 ) and where @xmath0 can be fitted to a power  law . at larger scales , however the increasing behaviour of the local dimension @xmath1 with the scale and the continuous approximation of the function @xmath0 to @xmath126 are absolutely clear . at this point",
    "we want to remark that , in the same way that the term fractal is not appropriate for the cox process , even having a correlation function decaying as a power  law at short scales @xcite , the galaxy distribution , even holding a similar property , is not a fractal in a rigorous sense @xcite .",
    "however in a more loose use of the term fractal @xcite , it could be appropriate to talk about a  fractal \" regime to describe the range of scales where @xmath7 follows a power ",
    "law , bearing in mind that a real self  similar point pattern , for example the soneira ",
    "peebles model described in section 3 , verifies other conditions ( self  similarity ) apart from a power  law decaying correlation function .",
    "we should like also to comment briefly on the relation of @xmath0 with the correlation function @xmath8 . both play their role in the analysis of the point pattern and , as stoyan & stoyan ( 1996 ) say , their relation is similar to that between the distribution function and the probability density function in classical statistics .",
    "the use of a cumulative quantity such as @xmath0 avoids binning in distance , which is often a source of arbitrariness for @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "let us explain why @xmath97 does suffer from the hindrance of splitting the information into disjoint bins .",
    "when one estimates @xmath8 in @xmath147 $ ] , it is assumed that within that bin the correlation function is constant , and since this is obviously not true , the larger the bin the larger the error , but we can not make arbitrarily small the size @xmath148 of the bin , because in that case we would not find any pairs . in other words , @xmath8 has an additional source of bias , not present in @xmath0 , due to the smoothing caused by averaging over pairs of points close to but not exactly @xmath23 units apart of each other ( stein 1996 ) .",
    "the correlation length ( @xmath149 ) is just the scale at which the density of galaxies is , on average , twice the mean number density . at smaller scales",
    "the pair correlations are due to non  linear perturbations , but homogeneity is not reached till @xmath150 .",
    "the main interest of @xmath0 is that it permits us to study clustering precisely in that difficult  range where @xmath151 , which can not be reached by @xmath97 because in this range the errors on the estimates of @xmath97 are comparable with their values , while the difference @xmath152 is still meaningful .    as a concluding remark , we want to stress that an unbiased estimator of a quantity related with the correlation integral , known as the @xmath0 function , has been applied to cosmological simulations and galaxy samples .",
    "this function , extensively used in the field of spatial statistics , provides a nice measure of clustering .",
    "the border correction used here does not waste any data points and does not introduce spurious homogeneization , giving reliability to the evaluation of this function at large scales . through the slope of @xmath0 we are able to calculate @xmath1 , which is an indicator of a possible fractal behaviour of the point process at a given scale range .",
    "the clear physical meaning of @xmath0 and @xmath1 helps us easily interpret the clustering properties of different models of structure formation at different scales .    regarding the analysis of the galaxy redshift surveys",
    ", we have seen that the estimator of the @xmath0 function is robust in the sense that it does not depend on the shape of the study region and provides us with reliable information about the point patterns over a wide range of scales .",
    "the behaviour of the local dimension @xmath1 for the real galaxy samples is particularly interesting to proponents of various fractal models of large  scale structure .",
    "if a constancy of @xmath1 with the scale is a necessary condition for having a fractal point pattern ( although it should not be sufficient as we have seen with the cox process [ see also stoyan ( 1994 ) for more examples ] ) , it is a neat conclusion of our analysis that the galaxy distribution does not even hold the necessary condition .",
    "the analysis presented here will provide a conclusive test to discover the scale at which the distribution of the matter in the universe is really homogeneous when applied , in the near future , to the bigger and deeper galaxy catalogues which will be soon ready for common use .",
