    "corrosion of solids is an everyday phenomenon of evident practical importance @xcite . the recent development of theoretical tools for the study of disordered systems and fractals in the context of statistical mechanics @xcite has triggered an outburst of activity in this subject .",
    "when an etching solution is put in contact with a disordered etchable solid , the solution corrodes the weak parts of the solid surface , while the hard , stronger , parts stay uncorroded . during this process",
    "new regions of the solid , both hard and weak , are discovered and come into contact with the etching solution . as corrosion proceeds the etching power of the solution may diminish : indeed , if the etchant is consumed in the reaction , etching becomes more and more unlikely until , finally , the solution is so impoverished and the solid surface so hardened that the corrosion process is arrested . at that moment",
    "all solid points in contact with the solution are too hard to be etched by the weakened etching solution .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this type of phenomenon is that the final solid - liquid interface has , in general , a fractal geometry , at least up to a certain scale @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the qualitative phenomenology observed in a nice experiment on pit corrosion of aluminum thin films @xcite .",
    "recently , a simple dynamical model of etching , capturing the aforementioned phenomenology , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied using both computational and analytical tools in @xcite , and from these studies strong evidence has been provided that the fractal properties of the solid surface , once the dynamics has stopped , are related to isotropic percolation . in principle , this is not an obvious result ; in fact , at first sight , one could think that the interface should be anisotropic as there is a preferential direction in which the solution advances by etching the solid .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide further theoretical evidence that indeed the critical behavior of the model dynamics is related to isotropic percolation .",
    "we also extend the previous relation to spatial dimensions larger than @xmath2 . to this aim ,",
    "we shall first review ( section 2 ) two known percolation models that will be useful in the forthcoming discussion : ( i ) dynamical percolation , and ( ii ) gradient percolation ( gp ) .    afterwards",
    "( section 3 ) , we will define the dynamical etching model @xcite in a circular ( spherical ) geometry , and will derive a phenomenological field theory for it ( section 4 ) . from the analysis of this field theory the parallelism with percolation will be set up in a rather clear way , and this will provide further theoretical evidence on the connection between etching and percolation phenomena .",
    "the approach presented in this paper will allow us to study the system _ self - organization _ from a field theoretical point of view , and to verify that , in certain limit , the system is self - driven to the neighborhood of a critical point without need of any parameter fine - tuning .",
    "this is a new path to self - organized criticality @xcite as will be discussed in the last section .",
    "in this section we review two different well - known percolation models that will be useful in the discussion of the etching processes under consideration .",
    "dynamical percolation is a model proposed for the study of the propagation of epidemics in a population , and/or for the analysis of forest fires .",
    "it is defined as follows @xcite .",
    "let us consider a regular square lattice ; at each site there is a variable that can be in one of three possible states ( we borrow the language from epidemiology @xcite ) : ( i ) infected sites , ( ii ) healthy sites susceptible to be infected , and ( iii ) immune sites ( non susceptible to be re - infected ) . at time",
    "@xmath3 a localized seed of infected sites is located at the center of an otherwise empty ( healthy ) lattice .",
    "the dynamics proceeds in discrete time steps either by parallel or by sequential updating as follows : at each time - step every infected site can infect a ( healthy ) randomly chosen neighbor with probability @xmath4 or , alternatively , heal and become immune to reinfection with complementary probability @xmath5 .",
    "any system state with no infected site is an _ absorbing configuration _ , i.e. , a configuration in which the system can get trapped and from which it can not escape @xcite .",
    "it is clear that depending on the value of @xmath4 the epidemics generated by the initial infection seed will either spread in the lattice ( for large values of @xmath4 ) or die out ( for small values of @xmath4 ) . in all cases",
    ", the epidemics will leave behind a cluster of ( healed ) immune sites , infinite or finite respectively for the two aforementioned cases .",
    "separating the two previous phases , there is a critical value of @xmath4 , @xmath6 , at which the epidemics propagates marginally , leaving behind a fractal cluster of immunized sites .",
    "it can be shown using field theoretical tools ( see below ) that this is a percolation cluster @xcite . in this way we have a dynamical model which at criticality reproduces the ( static ) properties of standard percolation .",
    "needless to say , the dynamical properties of the dynamical percolation equation , do not correspond to any known property of static percolation .",
    "the dynamical percolation model can be cast into the following langevin equation @xcite ( or equivalently into a field theory @xcite ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( the `` mass '' in a field theoretical language  ) and @xmath9 are constants , @xmath10 an activity field describing at a coarse grained level the density of infected sites , and @xmath11 a gaussian white noise .",
    "note the multiplicative nature of the noise , because of which the state @xmath12 defines an absorbing state , i.e. @xmath13 . note also the presence of a non - markovian term , that constitutes the key difference between this equation and the reggeon field theory , characteristic of many other systems with absorbing states .",
    "this non - markovian term stems from the existence of immunized sites , of which the system keeps indelible memory @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical and renormalization group analysis of eq.([dyp ] ) can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the critical dimension is @xmath14 , and the exponents , calculated in an epsilon expansion , coincide with the well known values for percolation calculated using other techniques @xcite .",
    "apart from the static exponents , also a dynamical exponent @xmath15 can be derived from this analysis of dynamical percolation @xcite .",
    "gradient percolation @xcite ( gp ) is defined in the following way : let us consider a bidimensional rectangular lattice of lateral sizes @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    an occupation probability given by @xmath18",
    "is assigned to sites in column @xmath19 ; this defines a transversal constant gradient , @xmath20 for the occupation probability .",
    "then , at each lattice site @xmath21 a random number @xmath22 $ ] , extracted from an homogeneous distribution , and representing the site reluctance to be occupied , is assigned .",
    "all sites with @xmath23 are declared occupied , while the remainings are empty . at the first column , @xmath24 ,",
    "all sites are occupied , while there is zero occupancy at the last one , @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . after identifying all sites",
    "as occupied or empty , one detects two connected regions ( clusters ) : one ( leftmost ) with a majority of occupied sites possibly surrounding `` lakes '' of empty sites , and another one ( rightmost sea ) possibly surrounding islands .",
    "separating these two regions there is an interface ( the frontier of the connected cluster of occupied sites ; it corresponds to the dark sites in figure 1 ) .",
    "the average position of this interface can be shown to be at the square lattice site percolation threshold , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in fact , gradient percolation has been used as a computational tool to obtain accurate values of percolation thresholds in different geometries by identifying the average position of the interface in sufficiently large lattices @xcite . in the case that we are considering ,",
    "the fractal dimension of the interface , @xmath27 , can be identified as the hull fractal dimension of the critical percolating cluster in a two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "there is an upper cut - off up to which this fractal behavior is observed ; it is fixed by the width @xmath28 which , in its turn , is determined by @xmath17 , and therefore by @xmath29 . it can be shown using percolation theory that @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in order to have a well defined percolation system , with negligible finite size effects , the limit @xmath32 has to be used . in this way , the length @xmath17 , determining the value of @xmath28 , is the parameter that controls the finite size effects ; the `` thermodynamic limit '' corresponds to @xmath33 and @xmath34 with both limits taken in the proper way @xcite .",
    "one can also estimate the variation of @xmath4 from on the leftmost to the rightmost extremes of the wandering interface , @xmath35 : @xmath36 the identity @xmath37 imposes the following scaling relation among exponents : @xmath38 , and therefore , @xmath39    let us observe that gradient percolation can also be defined in a circular geometry , in which the gradient changes with the radial distance to the origin , and the cut - off is determined by the width of the roughly circular crown in which the interface is inscribed .    summarizing , in this section , we have reviewed two well - known percolation models .",
    "dynamical percolation is a model that , at its critical point , generates dynamically a percolation cluster . on the other hand ,",
    "gradient percolation is a static model , in which an interface appears with the same hull fractal dimension of the percolation cluster , but with no intrinsic dynamics defined .",
    "having introduced the previous two percolation models , we go ahead by reviewing the dynamical etching model ( dem ) at the focus of our study @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the following ingredients ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "\\(i ) the random solid is mimicked by a two - dimensional square lattice of finite linear width @xmath16 and depth @xmath40 ( @xmath40 can be arbitrarily large , or even infinite ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the finite direction are imposed , leading to a cylindrical geometry .",
    "\\(ii ) a random quenched number @xmath41 $ ] ( extracted from a uniform distribution ) , assigned to each solid site @xmath42 , represents the site resistance to etching .",
    "\\(iii ) the etching solution occupies a fixed volume @xmath0 and is initially in contact with the solid through the bottom boundary , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , defining a solid - solution interface advancing on average in the upward direction .",
    "the solution contains an initial number @xmath43 of dissolved etchant molecules .",
    "its concentration at time @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "it is assumed that the etching power of the solution @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath47 . without loss of generality the proportionality constant",
    "can be fixed to unity .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that etchant particles diffuse infinitely fast in the solution ( at least much faster than the characteristic time scale of etching ) and , hence , @xmath46 is taken as spatially homogeneous , i.e. , the etching power does not depend on the spatial position in the solution .    at each discrete time - step all solid sites located at the solid surface and satisfying @xmath48 are dissolved ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , i.e. , they are removed from the solid , and a particle of etchant is consumed for each dissolved site , reducing in this manner the total etching power .",
    "calling @xmath49 the number of dissolved solid sites ( or equivalently the number of consumed etchant particles ) at time - step @xmath44 , and @xmath50 the total number of etched solid sites up to time @xmath44 , one can write @xmath51    as @xmath52 , a site having endured the etching attack at time @xmath44 will also resist at any time @xmath53 @xcite . furthermore , as a consequence of the corrosion process at time @xmath44 , @xmath54 new solid sites , previously in the solid bulk , come into contact with the solution at time @xmath55 .",
    "note that they are the sole candidates for corrosion at the next time - step .",
    "finally , since the solution has the possibility to detach finite solid islands , the global solid surface is composed both by the surfaces of the detached islands , and by the set of solid sites separating the solution from the bulk .",
    "this interface is called the _",
    "corrosion front_. a more detailed description of the model phenomenology can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we simply summarize the main features of the corrosion front at the arrest time @xmath56 .",
    "they are well represented by gp with @xmath57 : ( i ) the corrosion front shows fractal features with @xmath58 up to a characteristic scale ( front thickness ) @xmath28 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath59 ;    \\(iii ) @xmath60 , with @xmath61 ( therefore , in the right thermodynamic limit @xmath62 ) .",
    "let us introduce here a slight geometrical modification of the dem which makes more clear the connection to dynamical percolation . instead of considering a cylindrical geometry with the etchant solution invading the cylinder from the bottom ( as in fig .",
    "2 ) , we consider a flat infinite lattice , in which the volume @xmath0 of the etching solution is poured at time @xmath3 at an arbitrarily chosen central site as schematically shown in fig .",
    "the volume @xmath0 of the etching solution is constant .",
    "observe that with this geometry the model has some clear analogies with dynamical percolation .",
    "the main difference is that , in the spherical dem , the control parameter ( the corroding or infecting probability ) is not a constant but decreases in time as the etching process proceeds . as in cylindrical geometry , the dynamics can be roughly divided into two regimes @xcite : a _ smooth _ one when @xmath46 is much larger than @xmath26 , and a _ critical _ one when @xmath46 approaches @xmath26 . in the smooth regime ,",
    "fluctuations around the average behavior are small while in the critical regime fluctuations dominate the dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , at early time - steps , the etching power being sufficiently larger than @xmath26 , it is simple to show @xcite that the corrosion front is an approximate expanding circumference centered at the origin , and the number of new solid sites coming into contact with the solution at time @xmath44 satisfies the approximate relation @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the maximal radius reached by the corrosion up to time time @xmath44 . as the etchant power is reduced , the corrosion front becomes rougher and rougher , until the dynamics is finally arrested ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "since in the smooth regime @xmath65 , we can write @xmath66 . hence , within this approximation , it is possible to write down the following equation : @xmath67 since in this regime obviously @xmath68 , we can write eq .  [ smooth ] in a differential form as follows : @xmath69 whose solution is @xmath70    from this , the characteristic time of the dynamics is seen to be proportional to @xmath71 ; i.e. the etching power of the solution reaches the value @xmath26 in a time @xmath72 proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath68 , at the cross - over between the smooth and the critical regime ( i.e. when @xmath73 ) the solution reaches a distance @xmath74 from the origin . by differentiating this expression",
    "we conclude that the gradient of values of @xmath4 at which different sites have been corroded in the radial direction is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "finally , as @xmath76 , the gradient @xmath29 at @xmath72 is proportional to @xmath77 . in this way , in analogy with the cylindrical case , we expect that the geometrical properties of the final corrosion front are well represented by gp where the gradient of @xmath4 is dynamically generated . replacing @xmath29 with @xmath77 ,",
    "the scaling relations studied for gradient percolation can be extended to the present case .",
    "the previous description is valid only for the smooth regime , i.e. up to the time at which @xmath78 .",
    "however , since the critical regime is shorter than the smooth one , we have @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the average radius of the final corrosion front , and the previous estimations remain valid . in order to check that also in the critical regime the radial gradient of the solution etching power",
    "is given by @xmath75 , it is sufficient to assume that during this regime the corrosion front changes from a quite smooth geometry to a rougher one , with a final thickness @xmath28 . because of the much shorter duration of the critical regime one has @xmath81 . in this way , during the critical regime the solution etches a number of solid sites proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) , the variation of the etching power in this regime in average is @xmath83 .    in conclusion , we have defined a spherical version of the dem , and seen its connection with gradient percolation : given the time - diminution of @xmath4 , the system generates dynamically a spatial gradient of the values of @xmath4 at which the different sites were etched .",
    "let us finally emphasize that if , after the process is arrested , more etchant solution is added then the process continues until it is stopped again at a value of @xmath4 around @xmath26 . in this way",
    "the disordered solid plays the role of a chemical buffer . in the next section we present a more theoretical treatment allowing us to draw even more precise connections between dem and percolation theory .",
    "in order to construct a field theoretical description for the dynamical etching model , a possibility would be to write down the master equation defining the dynamics and then ( using a poissonian transformation @xcite or alternatively a fock - space formalism @xcite ) , derive a generating functional@xcite . instead of following that strategy",
    ", we prefer here to present a phenomenological set of stochastic langevin equations describing the model at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "this direct approach , ``  la landau '' , based on the analysis of the main symmetries and conservation laws of the discrete model , has proven very efficient in describing many other systems related to percolation , directed percolation and , in general , systems with absorbing states @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following three different local densities or coarse - grained fields :    * @xmath84 describing the local density of material susceptible to be etched at any time after @xmath44 .",
    "in the discrete model there are two types of sites contributing to this density : ( i ) bulk solid sites and ( ii ) `` fresh '' interface sites i.e. , solid sites freshly arrived to the solid - liquid interface ( susceptible to be etched at the next time - step ) .",
    "* @xmath85 is the local density of passivated and inert material . in the microscopic model",
    "this is the density of interface sites having already resisted an etching trial , i.e. , immune or not - susceptible to be corroded at any future time - step .",
    "* @xmath86 is the local density of corroded and replaced by solution sites , i.e. , the local density of etchant .",
    "the mean field equations ( rate equations ) describing the evolution of the averaged mean values of these magnitudes are : @xmath87 where @xmath46 is the probability to etch an active site at time @xmath44 , and @xmath88 is a positive constant . in",
    "what follows , and without loss of generality we fix @xmath89 .",
    "the interpretation of the first equation is : in order for the density of susceptible sites to change ( decrease ) in a region , it is necessary to have locally both a non - vanishing density of etchants and raw solid material susceptible to be etched .",
    "this restricts the dynamics to _ active _ regions , i.e. , zones in the interface separating the etchable - solid and the solution , in which non - vanishing local densities of @xmath90 and of @xmath91 coexist .",
    "moreover , the second and the third relations in eq .  [ deterministic ] express the fact that an active site becomes either a @xmath91-site , with probability @xmath92 ( the corrosion power at time @xmath44 ) , or alternatively , after healing , a @xmath93-site with complementary probability @xmath94 . note that , as @xmath95 , the total number of sites is conserved during the dynamics .",
    "it is worth stressing that eq .",
    "( [ deterministic ] ) captures the fact that sites resisting an etching attempt remain un - corroded indefinitely ( as occurs in the microscopic model ) .",
    "in fact , the number of @xmath93-sites grows monotonously until the etching process is arrested .",
    "observe that we have written so far mean field equations in which spatial dependence and fluctuations are not taken under consideration . at this point",
    ", it is convenient to introduce an activity field @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 as long as spatial dependences are omitted ) .    from eq .",
    "[ deterministic ] it follows immediately that @xmath98    in order to implement in our theoretical description the diminution of the etching power as the corrosion process proceeds , we write @xmath46 ( analogously to eq.(4 ) ) as @xmath99 where now @xmath100 $ ] is the number of consumed etchant particles up to time @xmath44 and , as before , @xmath0 is the solution volume . integrating in time the equation for @xmath91 in eq .",

    "\\label{det3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to go beyond this mean field description , it is necessary to include properly spatial coupling and fluctuations ( as a noise ) .    *",
    "_ spacial coupling _",
    "+ in principle , the spatial coupling can be taken into account by introducing additional terms into eq .",
    "however , because of the isotropic nature of the local dynamics , terms not invariant under space inversion ( as odd derivatives of the fields ) are not allowed . also , terms like @xmath103 can not appear , given the absence of surface tension in the microscopic rules @xcite .",
    "therefore , only terms as @xmath104 and higher powers of them are allowed .",
    "we introduce in eq .",
    "[ det3 ] the only relevant term in the renormalization group optics @xcite , namely a diffusive coupling @xmath105 , that typically appears in continuous descriptions of interacting particle systems .",
    "it will be checked _ a posteriori _ that , as a matter of fact , the omitted terms are irrelevant at criticality . * _ noise _ + in order to introduce properly the noise term , let us consider a small region in which there are @xmath106 `` fresh '' surface sites in contact with the solution of etching power @xmath4 .",
    "since these fresh sites have random independent resistances , the average number of dissolved sites will be @xmath107 and the fluctuation from this average number will be poissonian , i.e. of order @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that in the continuous description fluctuations of @xmath109 are proportional to its square - root .",
    "consequently , a term @xmath110 has to be added to eq .",
    "[ det3 ] , with @xmath11 being a gaussian white noise with zero mean and no spatio - temporal correlations : @xmath111 .",
    "deviations from gaussianity and higher order corrections can be easily argued to be irrelevant in the renormalization group optics , and therefore are not taken into account . this type of noise , with amplitude proportional to the square - root of the activity field , is characteristic of systems exhibiting a transition from an active to an absorbing phase @xcite : let us emphasize that wherever the activity field is zero , the dynamics is stopped @xcite .    introducing these two new ingredients in eq.[det3 ]",

    "it is worth stressing that even though the microscopic model has originally quenched disorder , it has been possible to describe it in terms of a stochastic equation with annealed noise .",
    "this simplification owes to the fact that every site is tested for corrosion at most once .",
    "if it survives , it will stay un - corroded indefinitely , as previously explained . in this way ,",
    "as every random number is used at most once it has not to be stored , there are no time correlations in the noise and , consequently , a stochastic process with no quenched disorder can be used to cast the discrete model .",
    "it is also important to underline that wherever @xmath10 vanishes , all activity , including fluctuations , ceases in eq.[ext ] . in other words",
    ", @xmath12 defines an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "this is just another way of saying that in the microscopic model , whenever there is no contact between the etchable solid and the solution , i.e. , when they are separated by an interface of passivated ( immune ) solid sites , the dynamics is arrested .",
    "continuous descriptions of systems with absorbing states are based on equations for the activity . in the neighborhood of any absorbing state phase transition the activity is small , and series expansions on the activity density ( as the ones we have used to arrive at eq.[ext ] ) are justified @xcite .    observe that , apart from the time dependence , of @xmath46 , eq .  [ ext ] is identical to the langevin equation describing _ dynamical percolation _",
    "( see eq .",
    "[ dyp ] ) @xcite .",
    "as described above , dynamical percolation is a rather well known dynamical process generating percolation clusters with a characteristic size determined by @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "[ dyp ] ) .",
    "let us analyze the differences between eq .",
    "[ ext ] and eq .",
    "particular attention must be paid to the exponential factor in the expression for @xmath46 ( see eq .",
    "[ p3 ] ) absent in dynamical percolation ; due to it some of the coefficients in eq .",
    "[ ext ] are time dependent , while their counterparts in eq .",
    "[ dyp ] are constants .",
    "first we discuss whether this extra time - dependence may affect the critical properties .",
    "note that @xmath46 does not fluctuate ( as verified in simulations in @xcite ) because it is a smooth function of the integral of the field over all the past time and the whole space .",
    "therefore , it is a deterministically decreasing time - dependent term ; or in other words it depends on spatio - temporal integrals of the activity field and not on the local activity field itself . hence , this term has not critical fluctuations , and does not affect the system critical properties .",
    "however , it is crucial in order to characterize the temporal crossover from the active to the absorbing phase . indeed , as the linear term coefficient in eq .",
    "[ ext ] includes a dependence on @xmath46 , for early times it is positive , corresponding to the fact that for early times the system is in the supercritical regime . as the etching mechanism proceeds , the argument of the exponential in eq .",
    "[ p3 ] grows in modulus , and there is a finite time , @xmath72 , at which the linear term coefficient takes its critical value .",
    "immediately after , the process becomes subcritical @xcite , i.e. it reaches the absorbing phase and , the dynamics tends to be stopped with an exponentially fast rate ( i.e. the number of active sites decreases exponentially ) .",
    "furthermore , as more and more sites are etched , the linear coefficient in eq .  [ ext ] becomes smaller and smaller than its critical value , and the exponential stopping rate is accelerated till a final time @xmath56 , at which an absorbing ( blocking ) configuration is reached .",
    "therefore , the main effect of the time - dependent linear term coefficient is that , by continuously diminishing , it drives the system to the neighborhood of the dynamical - percolation - field - theory critical point , but it does not add any new relevant operator that could eventually change the universality class . at this point , it is a matter of simple algebra to verify that all the terms omitted in our derivation are indeed irrelevant at the dynamical percolation , eq .",
    "[ dyp ] , renormalization group fixed point .",
    "given the previous discussion , one is allowed to say that eqs .",
    "[ p3 ] and [ ext ] define a _",
    "self - organized dynamical percolation langevin equation _ : without tuning any parameter the dynamics is arrested in the neighborhood of the percolation critical point , and critical ( fractal ) properties can be measured up to certain length scale determined solely by the parameter @xmath0 ( which controls the decrease rate of @xmath46 ) . in the limit @xmath1 the upper cut - off goes to infinity ;",
    "i.e. , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 the point at which the dynamics is stopped occurs at values of @xmath4 arbitrarily closed to its critical value in eq .",
    "[ dyp ] .    observe that the microscopic process is also self - organized : initially @xmath46 is taken to be super - critical , but it decreases monotonously till it reaches a critical value , and as soon as the sub - critical regime is reached the process is stopped in an exponential way .",
    "therefore , our continuous description reproduces the essential features of the microscopic model .",
    "the long range correlations ( generating fractal behavior ) in the dynamical etching process are generated in the regime in which the linear coefficient takes values around its critical value . as a consequence",
    ", it is inferred that the fractal properties of the final frozen configuration are related to the standard dynamical percolation renormalization group fixed point in any dimension .",
    "up to higher order terms , @xmath85 can be written as @xmath112 .",
    "this variable , the integral over the past history of the activity field , represents the statistics of immunized sites as described by janssen @xcite , and therefore , in our problem the statistics of `` surviving '' solid clusters in @xcite is also related to percolation properties .",
    "observe that regions of the cluster of corroded sites far from the final blocking corrosion front have been corroded with a value of @xmath4 larger than its critical value and therefore are not critical .",
    "for the same reason the final corrosion front can be seen as the external perimeter of an invading percolation cluster ( the etchant solution ) with @xmath113 .",
    "this explains the value of the fractal dimension @xmath58 found for this final corrosion front , which is nothing but the hull exponent of percolation in the lattice geometry under consideration @xcite .",
    "finally , we can perform a finite size scaling analysis of our equation in order to determine how different magnitudes scale as a function of the only free parameter , @xmath0 ; in particular , we can evaluate the distance from the critical point at which the process will be finally stopped .",

    "the argument of the exponential in eq .",
    "[ masa ] can be expanded in power series , and we have , up to the leading order : @xmath120 now we can use the scaling analysis presented in the first part of the paper . in the time interval between @xmath72 and @xmath56",
    "the solution erodes a region of the solid with , roughly speaking the shape of a circular hole limited by a crown of radius @xmath121 and width @xmath28 . as argued before @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , since the quantity @xmath123 gives the amount of material tested by the etching solution between @xmath72 and @xmath56 , we can write @xmath124 . therefore @xmath125 .",
    "writing @xmath126 one obtains @xmath127    the fact that @xmath0 is finite then implies that @xmath28 is finite and @xmath128 .",
    "it is only in the large @xmath0 limit that the process is stopped exactly at the dynamical percolation critical point .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , one has @xmath129 @xcite , and therefore the distance from the final mass to the critical one scales as @xmath130 , that is as the excursion of the occupancy probabilities along the separation interface of gp .",
    "therefore we have determined not only the universality class , but also established how finite size effect operate in the dem .    in conclusion ,",
    "all the critical ( fractal ) properties of the microscopic model can be shown to be related to ( dynamical ) percolation in any space dimension , by using the above presented continuous ( field theoretical ) representation , and finite size corrections can be evaluated .",
    "summing up , we have found that the dynamical etching model proposed by sapoval et al .",
    ", is a self - organized process describable by a the continuous langevin equation similar to that of dynamical percolation .",
    "this langevin equation includes a linear term coefficient that decreases monotonously as the etching process goes on . in this way",
    "as soon as it takes it critical value and enters the `` absorbing '' regime the etching process is stopped .",
    "consequently , the fractal ( scale invariant ) properties of the interface in the etching process are shown to be related to the ( dynamical ) percolation renormalization group fixed point .",
    "this result is valid in any space dimension .",
    "in particular , our analysis permits us to conclude that the etching upper critical dimension is @xmath14 , as in ( dynamical ) percolation . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also evaluated the role of finite size corrections that are essentially different from those of standard dynamical percolation .",
    "an interesting aspect from a theoretical perspective is that the field theory ( langevin equation ) describing the process is self - organized , in the sense that , without any parameter fine - tuning , fractal , scale - invariant properties are generated .",
    "however , it is only in the limit @xmath1 ( @xmath131 ) , that the upper cut - off for scaling diverges .",
    "this is in clear analogy with what occurs in other models of self - organization , as sandpiles @xcite for which critical behavior is observed in the limit of dissipation and driving going to zero @xcite .",
    "the mechanism discussed in this paper constitutes a new `` path '' to self - organized criticality @xcite , in which the control parameter decreases monotonously until it reaches the neighborhood of the absorbing - state phase transition at which the dynamics is arrested in an exponential way .",
    "this same mechanism will be investigated in the context of different types of absorbing - state phase transitions ( as directed percolation @xcite ) in a future work .",
    "observe that this scenario has the great advantage of being related in a clear - cut way to real physical systems , making therefore the observation of self - organized criticality much more accessible to experiments .",
