    "piezoelectric single crystals of the relaxor- ferroelectric material pb(zn@xmath7nb@xmath1)@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 ( pzn - x%pt ) oriented along an [ 001 ] direction , show exceptionally large piezoelectric deformations , more than 1% @xcite . in their pioneering work ,",
    "park and shrout@xcite proposed that the origin of the ultra - high strain values observed in [ 001]-oriented pzn-8%pt ( 8pt ) was a rhombohedral - to - tetragonal phase transition induced by the electric field .",
    "later , liu et al.@xcite reported similar behavior in pzn-4.5%pt ( 4.5pt ) ( see fig .",
    "a revolution in the world of piezoelectric devices seems certain to occur if the physical properties of such highly deformable materials can be understood and controlled .",
    "diffraction experiments on 8pt under an applied [ 001 ] field have revealed the true long - range symmetry evolution to be from a rhombohedral to a monoclinic phase @xcite .",
    "these measurements were performed on relatively thick samples , and a single tetragonal phase could not be reached before a sample breakdown ( see fig .",
    "however it was shown that it is the existence of such a monoclinic phase , rather than a tetragonal one , which is crucial in explaining the outstanding properties of these materials .",
    "monoclinic phases have been observed in the temperature - composition phase diagrams of three of the most important piezoelectric systems , pb(zr@xmath2ti@xmath8o@xmath4 ( pzt ) @xcite , pzn - x%pt @xcite , and very recently also in pb(mg@xmath7nb@xmath1)@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath4 ( pmn - pt ) @xcite , for compositions around the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , which represents the nearly vertical limit between the rhombohedral and the tetragonal phases .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that the region of stability of those new phases is enlarged following the application of an electric field @xcite .",
    "optical @xcite and x - ray diffraction @xcite measurements have also indicated a symmetry lowering in poled 8pt .",
    "in contrast to the rhombohedral or tetragonal phases , the polarization vectors in the monoclinic phases are no longer constrained to be directed along a symmetry axis and can rotate within the monoclinic plane . however , different polarization rotation paths have been observed in these materials , resulting in two types of monoclinic distortion , m@xmath5 ( as found in pzt ) and m@xmath6 ( as found in 8pt ) with space groups cm and pm , respectively . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1c , in the m@xmath5 type , the monoclinic plane is the pseudo - cubic ( 1 - 10 ) plane and the unit cell is doubled in volume with respect to the 4   pseudo - cubic unit cell . in the m@xmath6 type , the unit cell is primitive and the monoclinic plane is the pseudo - cubic ( 010 ) plane .",
    "very recently , vanderbilt and cohen @xcite reported a natural derivation of these monoclinic phases by extending the devonshire expansion of the free energy up to eighth - order , which is indicative of the large anharmonicity intrinsic to these highly - piezoelectric materials .",
    "we are using their notation for the various phases .",
    "a strong anharmonicity of the potential surfaces in lead oxides has also been proposed by kiat et al.@xcite based on experimental observations .",
    "first - principles calculations by bellaiche et al .",
    "have succeeded in reproducing the monoclinic phase in pzt , both at zero electric field @xcite and also under an applied field @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the calculations have shown that the huge increase in the piezoelectric coefficients close to the mpb of these materials is directly related to polarization rotation between the rhombohedral [ 111 ] and tetragonal [ 001 ] polar axes@xcite and , ultimately , to the existence of a monoclinic phase @xcite .",
    "this has very important consequences for a fundamental understanding of the piezoelectric properties in these compounds .",
    ", m@xmath9 , m@xmath10 notation is adopted following vanderbilt and cohen@xcite , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this new and revealing context , a detailed interpretation of the various observations is required , with the goal of making the novel high - strain piezoelectric systems as controllable and convenient as the pzt - based materials in current use .",
    "we have accordingly performed high - energy x - ray diffraction experiments on rhombohedral 4.5pt and 8pt crystals with an electric field applied _ in - situ _ along the [ 001 ] direction , and studied how the symmetry evolves . a field - induced long - range tetragonal phase has in fact been observed in both 4.5pt and 8pt compositions , thus confirming park and shrout s thesis@xcite .",
    "these experiments , together with those recently reported for 8pt @xcite , 9pt @xcite and xpt ( x@xmath11% ) @xcite , provide a much clearer picture of the field - induced behavior in rhombohedral pzn - x%pt .",
    "this work also provides the link between the anomalous macroscopic strain values in these materials and the evolution of the structural parameter under an applied field .",
    "4.5pt and 8pt samples were grown by the high - temperature flux technique described in ref .",
    "the samples were then oriented and cut in the form of rectangular parallelepipeds , with sides ranging from 0.5 to 3 mm , and at least two of the faces perpendicular to an [ 001 ] direction .",
    "gold was sputtered on two of the \\{001 } faces of all the samples , and thin wires were attached to enable an electric field to be applied along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "it should be noted that rhombohedral pzn - x%pt crystals as - grown have relaxor character and are , therefore , crystallographically disordered . in order to induce the ferroelectric long - range ordered state it is necessary to pole them under an electric field .",
    "this poling is typically accomplished by applying a field of about 10 kv / cm at room temperature . if the electric field is applied along the [ 111 ] direction , no change of symmetry is observed and the crystal in the ordered state is still rhombohedral .",
    "as described above , in this work the crystals are poled along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "very narrow mosaics were observed in the diffraction patterns demonstrating the excellent quality of the crystals .",
    "single - crystal diffraction experiments were carried out at the national synchrotron light source , on beamlines x17b1 and x22a , with high - energy x - rays of 67 kev ( @xmath120.18  ) and 32 kev ( @xmath120.38   ) , respectively .",
    "high - energy x - rays are needed to observe the crystal structure underneath the _ skin _ of the sample , which extends a few microns below the surfaces@xciteand behaves differently from the bulk , as shown by ohwada et al .",
    "@xcite . at x17b1",
    ", the high - flux monochromatic beam was obtained from a superconducting wiggler device by use of a si(220 ) crystal in laue - bragg geometry . at x22a , the third - order reflection of a si(111 ) monochromator crystal was used to provide the 32 kev beam .",
    "both beamlines are equipped with four - circle huber diffractometers , with si(220 ) and si(111 ) analyzer - crystals mounted in the diffraction path at x17b1 and x22a , respectively .    for the diffraction experiments with an _ in - situ _ electric field applied",
    ", a special sample holder was constructed in which the sample wires were soldered to the high - voltage leads , and the samples were unclamped and free to deform .",
    "the samples were coated with a silicone dielectric compound ( _ gc electronics - type z5 _ ) to prevent arcing , and kept in place with a tiny dab of vacuum grease .",
    "the maximum value of the applied field was limited by the dielectric breakdown of the samples ; in the case of the thinnest samples ( d= 0.5 mm ) , fields as high as 45 kv / cm were achieved .",

    "1a @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for crystal a are summarized in fig .",
    "the initial state at e = 0 , for which @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , corresponds to a rhombohedral phase with @xmath17  and @xmath18 @xcite . under the application of an electric field along the [ 001 ] direction ,",
    "a monoclinic phase of m@xmath5-type is induced for e @xmath19 30 kv / cm , as shown by a steady decrease in @xmath14 and @xmath20 , and a corresponding increase in @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "2 , top ) , and by a mesh scan in the reciprocal hhl plane ( the monoclinic plane ) around the pseudocubic ( 220 ) reflection at e = 20 kv / cm ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom - left ) .",
    "this monoclinic phase is similar to the one observed in pzt@xcite , in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 are rotated @xmath24 about the pseudocubic [ 001 ] direction and are approximately equal to @xmath25 , and @xmath21 @xmath12 @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the pseudocubic lattice parameter .",
    "the intensity distribution observed at 20 kv / cm in fig .",
    "2 ( bottom - left ) arises from the presence of four different m@xmath5 domains formed when the field is applied along the [ 001 ] direction , as previously explained in ref . .",
    "peaks are observed at two different positions along the longitudinal scans around h = k = 2 , corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the splitting between the pair of peaks at the smaller value of h = k ( i.e. the larger lattice parameter @xmath22 ) along the transverse ( field ) direction is related to the monoclinic angle , @xmath27 . for e = 30 kv / cm ,",
    "the mesh scans have a more complicated appearance in that most of the intensity has coalesced within a single broad region , but with a distribution of lattice parameters ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom - right ) , which we interpret as an incomplete transformation to a tetragonal phase . however ,",
    "even at e = 35 kv / cm , we did not observe a single tetragonal phase , probably because of the existence of several regions with different transformation fields .",
    "the results obtained for crystal c were rather different ; they showed unambiguously a crossover between the monoclinic and tetragonal phases , but at an anomalously low value of 11 kv / cm for this composition .",
    "the evolution of the lattice parameters under a [ 001 ] electric field for this crystal is shown in fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    ", the tetragonal phase , characterized by two lattice parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is indeed observed at high fields , as proposed by park and shrout on the basis of macroscopic measurements @xcite . when the field is decreased , the tetragonal distortion @xmath30 also decreases ; however , the tetragonal phase does not transform directly into a rhombohedral phase at low fields . instead",
    ", a monoclinic phase is observed as @xmath28 splits into @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the angle @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath21 becomes slightly greater than @xmath33 .",
    "this monoclinic phase is also of m@xmath5-type , and as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , the crystal remains monoclinic even at e = 0 .",
    "it is noteworthy that at this point , @xmath34 , corresponding to the singular case of a monoclinic cell with the polarization vector lying along the rhombohedral polar axis [ 111 ] , probably as a result of the underlying monoclinic distortion of the oxygen octahedra . in order to recover the initial rhombohedral phase",
    ", it would be necessary to apply a field in the reverse direction .",
    "4 shows the region of the reciprocal hhl plane around the pseudocubic ( 330 ) reflection for several different values of e. the intensity distributions observed in figs .",
    "4a - c ( e = 0 , 7 and 10 kv / cm , respectively ) arise from the four different m@xmath5 monoclinic domains formed when the field is applied along the [ 001 ] direction , as noted previously .",
    "once again , peaks are observed at two different positions along the longitudinal scans around h = k = 3 , corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "note that h = k = l = 3 is defined in order to reflect the value of @xmath21 at e = 0 , so that the value h = k = 3 in the scans means that @xmath22 = @xmath21 .",
    "the splitting between the pair of peaks at the smaller value of h = k corresponds to a monoclinic angle of @xmath31 = 90.13@xmath35 . as the field",
    "is increased , both @xmath22 and @xmath23 decrease , as shown by the shifts to larger h = k values . at e",
    "= 12 kv / cm , the intensity has coalesced into a single peak ( fig .",
    "4d ) and the crystal is in the tetragonal phase ( i.e. @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath23 , @xmath31 @xmath38 ) . from fig .",
    "3 , it is seen that the transformation occurs at about 11 kv / cm .",
    "the composition of the crystal c was confirmed using dielectric measurement , with t@xmath39 being @xmath40c .",
    "in addition to the exceptionally low phase transition field , the strain behavior associated with the phase transition in fig . 3 does not show the typical hysteretic jump at the transition field .",
    "we suspect that the defect structure and subsequent abnormal domain configuration may affect its phase transition behavior .",
    "further investigation is on going .",
    "4.5pt therefore behaves differently than 8pt , as can be readily inferred from fig.1b . as reported in ref . ,",
    "application of a [ 001 ] electric field to the latter yields a monoclinic cell of m@xmath6-type , with a primitive cell of about 4   along the edge . in the 8pt case the characteristic intensity distribution resulting from the four possible monoclinic domains",
    "is observed in the 0kl ( or h0l ) zone of reciprocal space , since the monoclinic angle is now contained within the ( 010 ) plane . figs .",
    "5a - d show such intensity distributions around the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) reflection , for several different values of the applied electric field , e= 0 , 9 , 15 and 35 kv / cm , respectively .",
    "unlike 4.5pt , @xmath23 remains approximately constant at k= 2.015 as the field is increased , while @xmath22 decreases , approaching @xmath23 ( see also fig.1b ) . at sufficiently high fields ,",
    "@xmath22 becomes equal to @xmath23 and the crystal becomes tetragonal , showing a single reflection around the ( 200 ) point in reciprocal space ( fig.5d ) , as also illustrated by the dotted lines in fig .",
    "direction for a 8pt crystal .",
    "solid symbols represent the monoclinic lattice parameters .",
    "open symbols represent the tetragonal lattice parameters .",
    "inverted triangles show the results of measurements of the @xmath41 parameter with a 100 @xmath42 m beam at two different depths in the crystal , as illustrated schematically in the inset.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when the field is removed , the crystal does not become rhombohedral , but resembles 4.5pt in this respect , with @xmath22 = @xmath43 @xmath44",
    ". however , unlike m@xmath5 , in this case the equality @xmath22 = @xmath21 corresponds to a higher symmetry than m@xmath6 , namely orthorhombic , o ( see also fig .",
    "this `` pseudo - monoclinic '' o phase ( o * ) has recently been observed in the phase diagram of pzn - x%pt for 9pt and 10pt@xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , the crossover between the monoclinic and tetragonal phases depends on the sample composition , as well as on the experimental conditions , such as mechanical clamping .",
    "high energy x - ray diffraction has revealed that the critical fields at which the monoclinic - to - tetragonal phase change takes place are different across the sample thickness@xcite , most likely due to a distribution of strain .",
    "6 shows the lattice parameters of one of the 8pt crystals under an [ 001 ] electric field .",
    "the results are very similar to those in fig .",
    "1b@xcite but in this case the tetragonal phase could be reached .",
    "we observed an intermediate region ( 7@xmath19 e @xmath19 20 kv / cm ) in which the two phases , monoclinic @xmath45 and tetragonal , coexist .",
    "measurements of the @xmath41 lattice parameter made with a narrow beam about 100 @xmath46 m in width ( inverted triangles in fig .",
    "6 ) showed that the tetragonal phase was indeed reached at different field values across the sample thickness , between 7 - 20 kv / cm .",
    "the most outstanding feature of the [ 001]-oriented rhombohedral pzn - x%pt crystals is the extremely high deformation that can be obtained under the application of an electric field . of paramount interest from the applications",
    "point - of - view is that large elongations can be obtained with very little hysteresis , which means virtually no domain - wall motion .",
    "as observed in the @xmath47 measurements plotted in fig.3 , the macroscopic deformation of about 0.6% in 4.5pt for e@xmath48 , corresponds very closely to the elongation of the unit cell along the field direction . the observed total strain is due partly to polarization rotation and elongation in the m@xmath5 phase between [ 111 ] and [ 001 ] and partly due to the @xmath41-axis elongation of the unit cell in the tetragonal phase",
    "however , a change of slope is clearly observed in both @xmath47 and the @xmath41 parameter with applied field at the m@xmath5-t phase transition , from which it can be inferred directly that the piezoelectric modulus ( elongation per volt ) in the monoclinic phase is about five times larger than that in the tetragonal phase .",
    "the observed macroscopic strain depends on the initial domain configuration , and thus , on the previous history of the crystal .",
    "the coincidence of the microscopic and macroscopic measurements in fig .",
    "2 indicates that the crystal consisted only of domains with polarizations @xmath49 away from the field direction [ 001 ] ( see refs . ) .",
    "when the field is applied , the polarization of the domains rotates until the crystal becomes tetragonal and monodomain with the polarization parallel to the field .",
    "however , a negative electric field or mechanical pressure along the field direction can favor domains with polarizations closer to the plane perpendicular to the field , as recently described for the pzt case@xcite .",
    "this fact can explain the dramatic differences observed between the stress - free - bipolar and slightly - clamped - unipolar strain curves reported by viehland @xcite on 8pt crystals .",
    "the deep strain level of -0.6% and the aggregate strain level of 1.2% observed in the bipolar strain curve of < 001>-oriented 8pt crystals correspond to the maximum spontaneous strain observed for @xmath45 , i.e. , the strain between the monoclinic @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath51 and @xmath41 axes , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1b ) .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of these materials to the experimental conditions , in particular to stress , is an indication of the near - degeneracy of the different phases around their mpb s .",
    "although the exact field values at which the phase transitions happen would need to be determined for very specific experimental conditions , we still can sketch an electric field vs. composition phase diagram for rhombohedral pzn - x%pt as shown in fig .",
    "close to the mpb at 8pt , the m@xmath5 phase is only stable at very low fields@xcite , while no m@xmath6 phase has been so far observed for 4.5pt .",
    "an intricate and history - dependent domain configuration is another consequence of the high degeneracy of the various phases displayed by the pzn - xpt system , which can also produce some exotic and unusual diffraction intensity distributions , especially for compositions very close to the mpb .",
    "8a shows the three - peak pattern usually observed in 8pt crystals in the hol zone around the pseudo - cubic ( 200 ) reflection at e=0 , arising from the four different monoclinic domains@xcite .",
    "however , on one occasion a very interesting rod - like intensity distribution was observed in the same crystal upon the removal of the electric field ( fig .",
    "8b ) , the d - spacings of the rods being identical to those of the bragg peaks . unfortunately",
    ", we were never able to reproduce such a rod pattern , but we speculate that this interesting behavior may be due to a complicated domain formation .",
    "another example of unusual diffuse scattering is shown in fig . 8c .",
    ", corresponding to the same region of the reciprocal space of a 8pt crsytal under a 25 kv / cm [ 001]-electric field .",
    "most of the crystal has transformed into the tetragonal phase characterized by a single lattice parameter in this zone ( as in fig.5d ) .",
    "the sharpness of this reflection shows the excellent quality of the crystal and the accuracy of the electric field orientation .",
    "however , when plotted on a logarithmic scale ( as in fig .",
    "8c ) , a fascinating fish - like shape is revealed , indicating that a small fraction of the sample retains a distribution of both , lattice parameters and monoclinic angle .    to conclude",
    ", the polarization rotation path has been investigated for rhombohedral 4.5pt and 8pt single crystals under a [ 001 ] electric field . in 4.5pt",
    "the polarization vector rotates directly from [ 111 ] towards [ 001 ] via a monoclinic m@xmath5 phase . in 8pt , which lies closer to the mpb , the polarization vector jumps at a relatively low field to the ( 010 ) plane and rotates in this plane , via a monoclinic m@xmath6 phase , towards [ 001 ] when the field is increased@xcite .",
    "for both compositions a single tetragonal phase has been observed at high fields .",
    "the behavior of the lattice parameters as a function of electric field can account for the ultra - high macroscopic piezoelectric deformations in terms of the microscopic deformation of the unit cell ( rotation plus elongation ) .    on occasions ,",
    "unique contour plots have been recorded , especially for the 8pt crystals , which show very peculiar intensity distributions and are believed to reflect the existence of heavily twinned materials and complicated local effects .",
    "further work is needed to fully understand some of these features ; in particular , a detailed study of the complicated diffuse scattering would provide very useful information about the local order in these materials .",
    "however , we may safely conclude that all the reported observations are consequences of the high anharmonicity and the delicate energy balance between the different phases in these highly deformable materials .    stimulating discussions with g. baldinozzi , l. bellaiche , l.e .",
