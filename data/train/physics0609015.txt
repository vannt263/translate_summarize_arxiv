    "new synthesis methods have been developed to fabricate nanoparticles ( nps ) with specific size and shape that in turn have enabled us to control optical properties to reveal new aspects of their underlying science and to tailor them for clearly defined applications .",
    "for instance , the optical response of nanoparticles is now being investigated for their potential in optics , magneto - optic , photonics , as a nanoengineered substrate on which the surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) response can be precisely controlled and optimized , and for chemical and biosensing applications , such as optical addressable diagnostic methods , devices , and therapies based on the plasmonic response of metallic nps .",
    "@xcite these advances , that allow metals to be structured and characterized on the nanometer scale , have renewed the interest in optical properties from physicists , chemists and materials scientists to biologists .    the optical properties of metal nanoparticles ( nps ) can be tuned by controlling their size and shape . indeed ,",
    "metallic nps support surface plasmon resonances , which are highly dependent on geometry and environment , providing a starting point for emerging research fields like plasmonics .",
    "@xcite surface plasmons are collective excitations of the electrons at the interface between a conductor and an insulator , and are described by evanescent electromagnetic waves which are not necessarily located at the interface .",
    "surface plasmon resonances ( spr ) appear in a number of different phenomena , including the optical response of materials at different scales , and the casimir and van der waals forces between macroscopic bodies .    besides to the technological implications ,",
    "the optical signature of nps can be also used as a tool of characterization .",
    "optical techniques are non - destructive and , with a proper implementation , they can be used to perform _ in situ _ and in real time measurements , providing statistical properties of the whole sample .",
    "these attributes are important because the properties of nanoparticles depend on the environment .",
    "@xcite when growth and characterization are made in different ambient conditions , this can be an additional uncontrollable variable for their interpretation .",
    "thus , optical spectroscopies can be used as complementary tools of structural characterization techniques like atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , etc .",
    ", which provide the image of a small piece of the sample , giving information about local properties and characterizing a few nps at a time .    the interesting observation that nps support spr that can be tuned by controlling their size and shape , offers a starting point for nanotechnology .",
    "@xcite in this article , we give some insights of the spr as a function of the morphology for silver nps of different polyhedral shapes . in the case of silver , many results indicate the presence of icosahedra , and decahedral shapes as well as other related morphologies like cubes and truncated cubes .",
    "@xcite a very similar pattern is found in gold and copper .",
    "when a particle is under the action of an electromagnetic ( em ) field , its electrons start to oscillate , transforming energy from the incident em wave into , for example , thermal energy in a so - called absorption process . the electrons can also be accelerated and then , they can radiate energy in a so - called scattering process .",
    "the sum of both effects , absorption and scattering , is known as the extinction of light , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this work ,",
    "we consider nps , which are large enough to employ the classical em theory .",
    "however , they are small enough to observe the dependence of the optical properties with its size and shape .",
    "this means that the inhomogeneities of the particle are much smaller as compared to the wavelength of the incident em field , such that , each point of the nanoparticle can be described in terms of its macroscopic dielectric function , which depends on the frequency only . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the elastic or coherent case , where the frequency of the absorbed and scattered light is the same as the frequency of the incident light .    when the size of a homogeneous particle is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light , the nps feel a field spatially constant , but with a time dependent phase .",
    "this is known as the quasi - static approximation , which is characterized by keeping the time but not the spatial dependence of the em field .",
    "the electric field causes the conduction electrons to oscillate coherently , displacing the electron cloud from the nuclei .",
    "the positive charges are assumed to be immobile , while the negative charges are allowed to move under the influence of the incident field .",
    "the long range correlation of electrons caused by coulomb forces , and the attraction between positive and negative charges results in a restoring force that changes the oscillation frequency of the electron cloud with respect to the positive background . in metallic particles ,",
    "the collective motion of electrons produces surface modes , whose number , position , and width are determined by the particle shape and variations of the dielectric function . since the main effect producing",
    "the restoring force is the surface polarization , the proper resonances depend on the np shape .",
    "for example , ellipsoids with three different axes have three different oscillation frequencies , depending on the relative length of the axes , such that , the optical response of the np is sensitive to the choice of the light polarization .    for nanoparticles of less than @xmath0  nm , radiation processes are negligible , then the particle only absorbs energy through the excitation of surface plasmon resonances .",
    "@xcite altering the surface , by modifying the size , shape , and/or environment of the conductor , the properties of spr can be tailored .",
    "spr of small particles can be studied in terms of the strength of the coupling to the applied field of the optically active electromagnetic surface modes of the system .",
    "these modes only depend on the morphology of the particle , and not on its material properties .",
    "@xcite    the optical response of a np characterized by a dielectric function @xmath1 , can be obtained by finding the solution of the maxwell s equations . in 1908",
    ", gustav mie found the exact answer for a homogeneous spherical particle of arbitrary size .",
    "@xcite however , exact solutions of the maxwell s equations for particles with other arbitrary shapes are not straight forward , and only approximations are possible .",
    "because of the complexity of the systems being studied here , efficient computational methods capable of treating large size systems are essential . in the last few years , several numerical methods have been developed to determine the optical properties of non - spherical particles , such as the discrete dipole approximation , t - matrix , spectral representation , finite difference methods , etc .",
    "@xcite in this work , we employ the discrete dipole approximation .",
    "the discrete dipole approximation ( dda ) is a well - suited technique for studying scattering and absorption of electromagnetic radiation by particles with sizes of the order or less of the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "dda has been applied to a broad range of problems , including interstellar dust grains , ice crystals in the atmosphere , interplanetary dust , human blood cells , surface features of semiconductors , metal nanoparticles and their aggregates , and more .",

    "as starting point , we can employ dielectric functions measured experimentally for bulk metals , @xmath47 , and then incorporate the main effects at the appropriate scale .",
    "the experimental dielectric function has contributions due to _ interband _ ( inter ) and _ intraband _ ( intra ) electron transitions , and assuming that both contributions are additive , we have @xmath48 _ interband _ contributions are due to electron transitions from occupied to empty bulk bands separated by an energy gap .",

    "[ fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the extinction efficiency of a silver nanocube . as we will show later , the structure below 335  nm is independent of the morphology of the particle , because the main absorption mechanism at those wavelengths is the _ interband _ component . at larger wavelengths ,",
    "the spectrum is very sensitive to the morphology of each np . for the cubic np",
    ", the spectrum shows a rich structure of peaks , contrary to the case of the sphere that has a single resonance .",
    "these peaks are associated to the spr inherent to the cubic geometry .",
    "fuchs  @xcite found nine spr for the cubic geometry , where only six of them account for more than the 95  % of the spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "the two most intense sprs correspond to the dipolar and quadrupolar charge distributions , and are located at 406  nm and 383  nm , respectively .",
    "the other sprs are at smaller wavelengths ( @xmath78  nm ) , making wider the spectrum .",
    "let us remind you that the small nanosphere shows a single peak because only a homogeneous arrangement of the charges is possible , giving rise to a dipolar charge distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "small cubes have more resonances because the charges are not longer able to arrange in a homogeneous distribution , resulting in many different ways beside the dipolar charge distribution , even in the long wavelength approximation .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the extinction efficiencies of truncated nanocubes with @xmath76 from @xmath79 to @xmath80 ( cuboctahedron ) are shown in solid lines .",
    "the spectra for spherical ( dotted line ) and cubic ( dashed line ) nps are also included for comparison .",
    "it is observed that even for the smallest truncation of @xmath81 , the spectrum is very sensitive to the morphology .",
    "the dipolar resonance is blue shifted by about 20  nm , and now becomes the most intense resonance .",
    "the location of the dipolar and quadrupolar resonances are now very close , such that , only one wide peak is observed around 386  nm , while the structure below 370  nm remains almost identical to the spectrum of the cube .",
    "the same trend is observed for larger truncations , and from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we find that as the length - size of the truncation increases : ( i ) the main resonance is always blue shifted , ( ii ) the peaks at smaller wavelength are closer to the dominant resonance , such that , they are hidden , and ( iii ) the width of the main resonance increases .",
    "for instance , the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of the @xmath79 truncated cube is about 20  nm , while the one for the cuboctahedron is 40  nm .",
    "this means that the secondary resonances do not disappear but they are hidden by the dominant resonance . for comparison",
    ", we have included the spectrum of a silver nanosphere of 10  nm of diameter . in this case",
    ", the sphere shows a single spr located at 356  nm and shows a fwhm of 15  nm .",
    "for icosahedra nps ( not shown here ) , we have found the main spr at 363  nm with a fwhm of 25  nm . we can conclude that as the number of faces of the np increases the energy range of the spectrum becomes smaller , the main resonance is blue shifted , the fwhm decreases , and",
    "fewer resonances are observed .",
    "therefore , by obtaining small differences in morphology , it is possible tune sprs at different wavelengths .",
    "another important morphology present in metal nps is the decahedron or pentagonal bipyramid , which is obtained by different synthesis methods .  @xcite it is known that metal nanoparticles of a few nanometers in size show different structural motifs depending on their size , composition and energetic conditions .",
    "@xcite the regular decahedron is composed with ten planar triangular faces which resemble two pentagons , as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig7](a ) , the extinction efficiency of the decahedral particle for the three different polarizations , as well as their average ( inset ) are shown .",
    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to the case of parallel polarization ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , while the dotted line corresponds to the perpendicular polarization ( c ) .",
    "we find a large anisotropy of the extinction when the light incidence is such that the electric field is parallel and perpendicular to the pentagonal motif .",
    "when the electric field is parallel to the pentagon , the corresponding spectra are very wide with a fwhm of 90  nm , and a maximum at about 403  nm . on the other hand ,",
    "when the electric field is perpendicular to the pentagon , the spectrum shows a maximum at about 343  nm , is about three times less intense , and has a fwhm of 45  nm .",
    "the spectra for both parallel polarizations are almost identical , except near the maxima , where small differences are observed .",
    "these differences would be discussed below . on the other hand ,",
    "the maxima of the average spectrum is at 410  nm , and the fwhm is about 90  nm . in conclusion , we find that the parallel polarization dominates the average spectrum .",
    "the morphology of the decahedral np shows several sprs in a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "however they are not observed because ( a ) they are close of each other , such that , the most intense hides the others and/or ( b ) dissipation effects make wider the resonances , and the detailed structure is `` washed out '' .  @xcite    we have already mentioned that the location of the resonant frequencies of the proper modes of the system is not immediate , because it requires taking the non - dissipation limit . here , to find the location of each one of the sprs for each morphology , we have considered that the constants @xmath55 and @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ fdiele ] ) tend to infinity to achieve this limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , we show the extinction efficiency corresponding to the three different polarizations described above , but taking the non - dissipation limit . here",
    ", we clearly observe that the peaks become more pronounced , as well as new peaks appear , such that , we can distinguish the different resonances that compose the spectra .",
    "for instance , the optical response for the perpendicular polarization is composed of at least two different sprs at 343 and 357  nm of about the same magnitude .",
    "for the spectra corresponding to parallel polarized light , we find several sprs . in the case when the electric field is along the vertices of the pentagon , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , we identify at least eight different resonances .",
    "the first one is at 353  nm that gives rise to a small shoulder , as well as other resonances at 372 , 437 , 447 , 464 , 478 and 492  nm .",
    "the sprs at 437 and 447 are also present when the electric field is parallel and along the edges of the pentagons .",
    "for the case along the vertices ( dashed line ) , the main resonances are at 405  nm and 430  nm and their intensity are very similar .",
    "while for the polarization along the edges , the main sprs are red shifted to 409  nm and 447  nm , respectively .",
    "the first one is almost twice as intense as the other . these dissimilarities in location and intensity of the resonances are responsible for the small difference observed in the spectra . however , the main difference is between light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the pentagon , when sprs of very different energy or wavelength , and intensity can be tuned just by changing the light polarization .",
    "when the size of the np is in the range of 1  nm to 5  nm , the regular decahedron is never observed .",
    "the most common shapes are the truncated ones , the marks decahedron and the round decahedron .",
    "the first structure was introduced by marks  @xcite and is remarkably stable and contains extra @xmath83 facets . in very clean growth conditions or with weak interactions with substrates ,",
    "this is one of the predominant shapes for the discussed size interval .",
    "an alternative way to describe the marks decahedron is as a regular decahedron , which has truncations on its facets , as shown in fig .",

    "this type of particle is frequently formed when colloidal growth methods are used .",
    "@xcite here , we discuss the optical response of the marks decahedra with a truncation of @xmath84 , and the maximum truncation of @xmath85 , which corresponds to the star decahedron , and we also discuss the rounded decahedron with a truncation of @xmath81 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the extinction efficiencies of the regular ( dotted line ) , marks ( solid line ) , star ( dashed line ) and rounded ( dashed - dotted line ) decahedral nanoparticles for the three different polarizations are shown .",
    "[ fig9](a ) corresponds to the case of parallel polarization along the vertices , and ( b ) to parallel polarization along the edges , while ( c ) corresponds to the perpendicular one .",
    "we observe for the perpendicular polarization , fig  [ fig9](c ) , that the optical response of the regular decahedron does not change for small truncations , in both cases , the marks and rounded decahedra . on the other hand ,",
    "the response of the star decahedron is totally different since it shows a sharp resonance at 380  nm with a fwhm of 20  nm , while for the other morphologies the maxima is at 343  nm , about seven times less intense , and has a fwhm of 45  nm .",
    "for both parallel polarization cases , all the spectra of the truncated decahedra show differences to respect to the regular one .",
    "for the rounded and marks decahedra , the same effect is observed as in the case of truncated cubes .",
    "the main resonance is blue shifted , and becomes the most intense resonance after truncation , and also its fwhm decreases , as a result of the increment of the faces . on the other hand ,",
    "the star decahedral shows the opposite behavior . in this case , the main resonance is red shifted to around 550  nm , and the spectra becomes very wide , since a lot of resonances are present .",
    "comparing the star decahedron with the cube , we find some similarities , such as : ( i ) a large number of resonances located in a wide range of wavelengths ; ( ii ) the main resonance is located at the right of the spectra .",
    "we also observe that these two morphologies present the sharpest vertices , such that , the charge distribution at the tips becomes very inhomogeneous , leading to extreme field localization .",

    "the different stages were characterized by tem and optical spectroscopy , where the extinction spectra were measured .",
    "the optical spectra for cubes , cuboctahedra and octahedra show highly complex plasmon signatures as a result of their geometries . for such large nps , the spectra show a red shift with increasing size as a consequence of the radiation effects . taking into account",
    "the later , the overall behavior of the optical spectra as a function of the nps geometry agrees well with our theoretical results .",
    "the influence of morphology on the optical properties of metal nanoparticles is studied theoretically using the discrete dipole approximation .",
    "the location of the surface plasmon resonances of silver nanoparticles of different polyhedral shapes was obtained .",
    "we found that as the size truncation of the cubic nanoparticle becomes larger , the main resonance is blue shifted , overlapping secondary resonances , and therefore , increasing the full width at half maximum of the main resonance . for decahedral particles , the truncation to marks and rounded decahedra shows the same blue shift effect .",
    "however , the full width at half maximum of the main resonance decreases , maybe because the secondary resonances no longer exist . it is also found that nanoparticles with fewer faces , like the star decahedron , show resonances in a wider range of wavelengths , perhaps because these geometrical shapes have sharper vertices as compared to the others .",
    "it is expected that this information would be useful to motivate the development of more complex nanostructures with tunable surface plasmon resonances .",
