    "<S> we derive a nonlinear schrodinger equation with a radical term , @xmath0 , as an asymptotic model of the resonantly absorbing bragg reflector ( rabr ) , i.e. , a periodic set of thin layers of two - level atoms , resonantly interacting with the electromagnetic field and inducing the bragg reflection . </S>",
    "<S> a family of bright solitons is found , which splits into stable and unstable parts , exactly obeying the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton with the largest amplitude , @xmath1 , is a  quasi - peakon \" , i.e. , a solution with a discontinuity of the third derivative at the center . </S>",
    "<S> families of exact cnoidal waves , built as periodic chains of quasi - peakons , are found too . the ultimate solution belonging to the family of dark solitons , with the background level @xmath2 , is a dark compacton . </S>",
    "<S> those bright solitons which are unstable destroy themselves ( if perturbed ) attaining the critical amplitude , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the wave field around this critical point is studied analytically , revealing a switch of the system into an unstable phase , in terms of the rabr model . </S>",
    "<S> collisions between bright solitons are investigated too . </S>",
    "<S> the collisions between fast solitons are quasi - elastic , while slowly moving ones merge into breathers , which may persist or perish ( in the latter case , also by attaining @xmath3 ) . </S>"
