    "a key feature of an integrable system is the presence of an algebraic transformation method which generates new solutions from old ones . in particular even by starting with a trivial solution one obtains a hierarchy of interesting global solutions . for the kdv equation one",
    "thus obtains the solitons via a bcklund transform .",
    "solitons are solitary traveling waves with localized energy that are stable when interacting with each other .",
    "many of the modern techniques in integrable systems theory stem from classical surface theory , developed by bcklund , bianchi and darboux amongst others for the structure equations of special surface classes .",
    "away from umbilic points the structure equation of constant mean curvature ( ) surfaces is the sinh - gordon equation , whose trivial solution gives rise to the round cylinder .",
    "the term bubbleton is due to sterling and wente @xcite , and the bubbletons are the solitons of the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "the single bubbletons are obtained by transforming the standard cylinder by a bianchi - bcklund transform .",
    "the resulting transformed cylinder globally looks like the standard cylinder except for a localized part in which bubble - like pieces are added to the underlying surface , see figure [ fig : bubbleton ] .",
    "a video of how bubbles interact when they move through each other can be seen at @xcite .",
    "recently the classical transformations have received a treatment from the modern point of view of dressing @xcite .",
    "bubbletons can be realized by dressing the round cylinder by a class of very simple maps , called simple factors @xcite . by repeatedly applying the bianchi - bcklund transformation to the standard round cylinder one produces the multi - bubbletons classified by sterling and wente @xcite .",
    "while graphics of these surfaces clearly suggest that they are not embedded ( see figure [ fig : bubbleton ] ) , there does not seem to be a direct proof of this fact in the literature .",
    "an indirect proof when the target is the 3-sphere is given in @xcite .    the purpose here is to prove that a single bubbleton is not embedded .",
    "this is proven by showing that single bubbletons possess a planar curve which is not homologous to zero on the surface .",
    "it is shown that this curve has turning number at least three , which implies that the surface can not be embedded .",
    "furthermore the choice of the singularity in the simple factor is reflected in the geometry of the resulting bubbleton .",
    "the monotone sequence of the singularities are indexed by an integer @xmath0 for @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the number of bubbles of the bubbleton , and @xmath3 turns out to be the turning number of the planar curve .",
    "if @xmath4 , then in the spinor representation of euclidean 3-space @xmath5 we identify @xmath6 via @xmath7 the extended frame of a round cylinder ( up to isometry and conformal change of coordinate ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 the sym - bobenko formula @xcite for a surface in euclidean 3-space @xmath5 is a formula of the immersion in terms of its extended frame @xmath10 . in our conventions @xcite , the associated family with constant mean curvature @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "if we pick one member of the associated family @xmath15 and choose @xmath16 , and insert the extended frame of the standard round cylinder , we obtain @xmath17 this is clearly a round cylinder which is generated by a circle in the @xmath18-plane of radius @xmath19 centered at the point @xmath20 parallel translated along the @xmath21-axis . any curve @xmath22 for some constant @xmath23",
    "is not contractable on the cylinder . by restricting the @xmath24-coordinate to any interval of length",
    "one we obtain an embedded round cylinder .",
    "in general , or when the parametrization is less explicit , one can describe the period problem as follows .",
    "suppose we have an extended frame @xmath10 and an associated family of surfaces as in .",
    "then periodicity @xmath25 for all @xmath26 can in general not hold for all @xmath27 .",
    "but if we fix @xmath28 , then periodicity reads @xmath29 if we define the monodromy matrix @xmath30 with respect to the translation @xmath31 of @xmath10 by @xmath32 then the period problem reads @xmath33 the monodromy matrix is not well defined , since it depends on the choice of a base point , and so is only defined up to conjugacy . however , the periodicity conditions are invariant under conjugation .",
    "since we need some of the above in the special case of the round cylinder , let us specialize again in this case .",
    "if @xmath10 is the extended frame of a round cylinder , we choose the base point @xmath34 and note that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "as before pick @xmath37 .",
    "the monodromy of @xmath38 with respect to the translation @xmath39 is then @xmath40 and a quick computation confirms that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "there is a deformation technique in the theory of harmonic maps called _ dressing _ @xcite . in particular , dressing by specific very simple maps corresponds to the classical bianchi - bcklund transformation @xcite , and amounts to adding bubbletons to the standard round cylinder - these simple maps are called _ simple factors _ @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the theory of simple factors in the context of surfaces in @xmath5 . let @xmath43 be the hermitian projection onto a line @xmath44 , and @xmath45",
    ". for @xmath46 , set @xmath47 to normalize make the determinant equal to 1 and do a gram - schmidt factorization at @xmath48 to obtain @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 upper triangular with positive real entries on the diagonal .",
    "a _ simple factor _ is a map of the form @xmath52 by proposition 4.2 in @xcite dressing by simple factors is explicit , and adapted to the case at hand in theorem 1.2 in @xcite : generally , suppose that @xmath10 is an extended frame , and @xmath53 a simple factor with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . then the dressed extended frame is given by dressing on an @xmath56-circle with @xmath57 , and is @xmath58 we next show that to obtain the single bubbletons we can choose diagonal simple factors with very specific singularities @xmath59 .    up to isometry and conformal coordinate change any single bubbleton can be obtained by dressing the round cylinder by a simple factor @xmath53 with line @xmath60 $ ] , so of the form @xmath61 with real @xmath62 of the form @xmath63    if we want to dress the extended frame of the round cylinder , then we will have to choose the line @xmath64 and the singularity @xmath59 in such a way that the resulting bubbleton remains periodic with the same period as the underlying round cylinder . to get the conditions on @xmath64 and @xmath59 we will need to look at the monodromy of the dressed extended frame , with respect to the same translation @xmath65 . since @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , for the dressed frame we also have @xmath66 since @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "hence with the monodromy @xmath30 in of the round cylinder we obtain for the bubbleton monodromy @xmath69 thus the condition on the line @xmath64 is that it has to be an eigenline of @xmath70 .",
    "now @xmath71 acts transitively on @xmath72 and @xmath73 for any @xmath74 . since dressing by @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "give the same surface up to isometry and conformal coordinate change , we may choose without loss of generality the line @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the monodromy of an extended frame of a surface should be holomorphic in @xmath36 and unitary for @xmath27 . clearly away from @xmath78",
    "we have @xmath79 so @xmath80 is unitary on the unit circle , if we demand that @xmath81 further @xmath80 is holomorphic for all @xmath36 away from @xmath82 . to make these two singularities removable , we impose the condition that @xmath83 , or equivalently that @xmath84 for the function @xmath85 in .",
    "this is equivalent to there existing an integer @xmath86 such that @xmath87 rewriting this as a quadratic equation we obtain for each @xmath88 two real solutions @xmath89 first observe that @xmath90 . now @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "but since @xmath93 dressing by @xmath75 and @xmath94 gives the same bubbleton up to isometry and conformal coordinate change .",
    "thus @xmath95 and @xmath96 give the same bubbleton , so we may omit the subscript , restrict to non - negative integers @xmath97 , and set @xmath98 , so that @xmath59 is as in .",
    "then @xmath99 , and consequently @xmath100 note that when @xmath101 then @xmath102 respectively , and it is not hard to see that @xmath103 when @xmath104 .",
    "hence the condition that @xmath105 requires that we impose @xmath106 , and consequently we may restrict to the case @xmath1 . to see that the singularities at @xmath78 are now apparent",
    ", we use lhoptial s rule to obtain @xmath107 with sign depending on the parity of @xmath2 . a similar computation , or using @xmath108 shows that @xmath109 is also a removable singularity .",
    "to obtain any multi - bubbleton of finite type one can dress by a finite product @xmath110 of simple factors , but we may use each integer @xmath1 only once , since otherwise the singularities are no longer removable in the dressed monodromy .",
    "hence on a multi - bubbleton each lobe number can only appear once .",
    "with the preparations of the preceding two sections we can now prove our main result .        from the extended frame of a bubbleton is @xmath112 with @xmath113 we next explicitly compute the curve @xmath114 on a bubbleton .",
    "we may set the mean curvature to @xmath115 .",
    "inserting the bubbleton frame into the sym - bobenko formula gives three terms @xmath116 in the following we will compute these three terms .",
    "first , we have for @xmath75 in that @xmath117 the second term is @xmath118 if @xmath119 $ ] , then with respect to the standard basis of @xmath120 the projection @xmath121 is @xmath122 hence for the line @xmath123 in we obtain @xmath124 the function @xmath85 defined in evaluated at @xmath125 along @xmath114 reads @xmath126 .",
    "then @xmath127 in along @xmath114 computes to @xmath128 evaluating at @xmath48 gives @xmath129 now @xmath130 , and gram - schmidt on @xmath131 gives @xmath132 putting everything together gives that @xmath133 is equal to @xmath134 differentiating with respect to @xmath14 gives that @xmath135 is equal to @xmath136 and consequently @xmath137 thus the final contribution to the curve @xmath114 comes from @xmath138 with the real valued functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 given by @xmath141 inspection of the three summands in computed in , and show that the @xmath114 curve on the bubbleton is a planar curve , since the off - diagonal terms do not have an imaginary part . combining these terms then gives the planar curve @xmath142 with @xmath143 the turning number of this immersed planar curve @xmath144 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}^2,\\,x \\mapsto ( x(x),\\,z(x))$ ] computes to @xmath145 since @xmath146 , the planar curve has self intersections , and thus the bubbleton is not embedded .",
