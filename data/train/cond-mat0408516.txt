    "understanding the many - body aspects of the holstein model @xcite has been a long standing open problem .",
    "significant progress has been made in understanding the single polaron problem through analytic treatments in the small and large polaron limits and numerical approaches in the intermediate size case @xcite . while studies of the many - polaron problem , involving spin degrees of freedom , yielded interesting insights for bipolarons and their phase transitions @xcite , the simpler case of spinless many - polaron problem",
    "has received only scant attention @xcite . with the renewed interest in strongly correlated manganite systems @xcite ( which are of high electronic density when",
    "the electron - phonon interactions are supposed to be important ) it is imperative that the effective interaction between polarons be understood so that a serious attempt at explaining the rich phase diagram of these systems be made . although studying manganites demands knowledge of the effective jahn - teller polaronic interaction , in the low - doped case the effective hamiltonian at @xmath6 k for the occupied states can be taken as a holstein model @xcite .",
    "thus a good understanding , involving exact results , of the simpler effective polaronic interaction for the holstein model , which has been elusive so far , is highly desirable .",
    "furthermore , an effective polaronic hamiltonian even in the simplest spinless 1d case would also be quite useful for modelling luttinger liquid ( ll ) to charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transitions in half - filled systems .",
    "quasi-1d organic conjugated polymers [ such as @xmath7 , charge transfer salts [ such as ttf(tcnq ) ] , and inorganic blue bronzes ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) @xcite are good candidates for such broken symmetry in the ground state leading to unit cell doubling .",
    "the present paper , using lang - firsov transformation @xcite , provides a transparent perturbative approach to deriving the _ effective hamiltonian of interacting polarons in d - dimensions _ when the band narrowing is significant .",
    "the resulting polaronic hamiltonian , _ exact to second order in perturbation _ , is studied in 1d at @xmath6 k for density - density correlation effects .",
    "the correlation function exponent of the concomitant quasi - long range order is demonstrated to be useful in characterizing the luttinger liquid and the charge - density - wave phases of the system .",
    "we begin in 1d by taking the unperturbed hamiltonian to be the non - interacting polaronic term@xcite @xmath9 with the perturbation being @xmath10 where @xmath11 make up the lang - firsov transformed holstein hamiltonian and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the fermionic ( phononic ) destruction operator , @xmath14 the debye frequency , @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 , with @xmath0 being the hopping term , and @xmath17 the polaronic binding energy .",
    "the eigen states are given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the ground state with zero phonons .",
    "the eigen energies are @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath21 , the first order perturbation term is zero and the relevant excited states correspond to states with non - zero phonons .",
    "next , we represent @xmath22 in real space as phononic excitations at different sites with one phonon state being @xmath23 which is @xmath24-fold degenerate and can correspond to any site @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the electronic state @xmath26 is represented in the momentum space .",
    "we will now calculate second - order perturbation terms _ exactly _ @xmath27 now @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a non - zero integral multiple of @xmath14 .",
    "assuming @xmath30 ( which certainly is true for realistic values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 found in manganites ) and using @xmath33 we get the corresponding second - order term in the effective hamiltonian for polarons to be @xmath34 in the above equation , the term @xmath35 produces phonons at sites @xmath25 and @xmath36 . hence to match that its counterpart @xmath37 should produce phonons in at least one of the two sites @xmath25 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus the index @xmath38 @xmath39 or @xmath36 .",
    "next on defining @xmath40 and @xmath41 we get @xmath42 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then using @xmath43 with @xmath44 being a state with @xmath45 phonons we get the effective polaronic hamiltonian to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] , and @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the _ single _ polaronic energy part of the above hamiltonian matches with the self - energy expression at @xmath51 obtained by marsiglio @xcite and the self - energy at a general @xmath52 by stephan @xcite and lends credibility to our results .",
    "furthermore , in the work of hirsch and fradkin @xcite , the coefficient of nearest - neighbor interaction agrees with our coefficient @xmath53 for large values of @xmath54 while the coefficients of the next - to - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping are in disagreement with those of ours and the results of refs .",
    "next we make the connection that , on using wigner - jordan transformation @xmath55 , we can map the effective polaronic hamiltonian exactly ( up to a constant ) on to the following nnn anisotropic heisenberg spin chain : @xmath56 where the coefficient of the first term represents coupling to a longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "although the nnn interactions in the above hamiltonian do not produce frustration , nevertheless the hamiltonian can not be solved by coordinate bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "hence we take recourse to analyzing the properties of the effective hamiltonian numerically by using modified lanczos technique ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the spin hamiltonian @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ hspin ] ) with @xmath58 , i.e. , without nnn interaction , has been shown to undergo a ll to cdw state transition at zero magnetization ( @xmath59 ) when @xmath60 and at non - zero magnetizations is always a ll @xcite .",
    "on including a non - zero @xmath61 , the disordering effect increases because the nnn interaction is only in the transverse direction and the ll to cdw transition will occur at higher values of @xmath53 .",
    "we expect that including @xmath61 does not change the universality class and that the central charge @xmath62 .",
    "we first study the static spin - spin correlation function on rings with even number of sites @xmath24 and extract information about the critical exponent .",
    "the static spin - spin correlation function for a chain of length @xmath24 is given by @xmath63 and has the asymptotic behavior @xmath64 for the anisotropic heisenberg model when @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 is an unknown constant and @xmath67 when the system is in disordered ( or ll ) state , @xmath68 is the transition point to antiferromagnetic ( cdw ) state , and @xmath69 means system is totally antiferromagnetic ( or cdw ) .",
    "we will now derive an analytic expression for the critical exponent @xmath70 based on the work of luther and peschel @xcite . the effective polaronic hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) can be written in momentum space as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , constant terms have been ignored .",
    "next , we linearize the kinetic energy term close to the fermi points and follow it up with the bosonization procedure .",
    "then on taking exchange effects into account , as pointed out by fowler@xcite , we obtain the following bosonized hamiltonian @xmath73 \\sum_{k>0;i=1,2 } \\rho_{i}(k)\\rho_{i}(-k ) \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\mbox{}+\\left[\\frac{8j^z-32 j_2}{n}\\right ] \\sum_{k>0}\\rho_{1}(k)\\rho_{2}(-k ) . \\label{hbos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to note that only the forward scattering part involving the coefficient @xmath53 contributes to the self energy correction .    now , to calculate the critical exponent @xmath70 , we will follow the usual procedure and diagonalize the bosonized hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hbos ] ) using the following transformations , @xmath74 and @xmath75 then , on setting the coefficient of the off - diagonal term equal to zero in the transformed hamiltonian , we get @xmath76 using eq.([tanh ] ) we obtain @xmath77}^{\\frac{1}{2 } } .\\ ] ]",
    "it is known that for an anisotropic heisenberg spin chain , when @xmath78 is even the correlation function goes to zero smoothly as the longitudinal interaction goes to zero @xcite .",
    "hence we have calculated @xmath79 only for odd values of @xmath78 with @xmath24 = 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , and 22 at @xmath80 = 1 and different values of @xmath53 and @xmath61 .",
    "using a linear least squares fit for a plot of @xmath81 versus @xmath82 we obtained the value of @xmath70 from the slope at each value of @xmath53 and @xmath61 .",
    "the error in @xmath70 for all curves is within @xmath83 and hence verifies that one has the expected quasi - long range order . for @xmath84 and @xmath58",
    "we get @xmath85 which includes the exact value of @xmath86 obtained from bethe ansatz .",
    "thus we expect the @xmath70 values obtained by our procedure to be reasonably accurate .",
    "since for @xmath87 and @xmath58 we obtain a cdw state , by increasing @xmath61 at any @xmath87 we should increase the disordering effect and hence we see in fig .",
    "1 that @xmath70 value increases .",
    "we find that for @xmath88 the value of @xmath70 becomes slightly negative but with magnitude within the error of 0.05 . at higher @xmath53 values ( @xmath89 and higher )",
    "@xmath70 tends to zero . at small values of @xmath53 ( @xmath90 ) as @xmath61 increases initially @xmath70 increases even to values above 2 and then decreases to values below 2 .",
    "we think that this interesting feature is due to smaller values of @xmath61 enhancing the disordering effect while the larger values of @xmath61 increase correlations build up with the system becoming less ll like .",
    "however the behavior at @xmath91 and @xmath92 needs further understanding .",
    "our derived analytic expression , reliable at small values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , shows that @xmath70 does increase with increasing values of @xmath61 and gives values reasonably close to the numerical ones for @xmath95 .",
    "we will now consider the mass gap , at the half - filled state for the hamiltonian @xmath96 [ see eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) ] , defined as twice the energy difference between the ground state with @xmath97 electrons and the ground state of the @xmath78 electronic system . the mass gap is calculated for rings with @xmath24 = 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 sites .",
    "including @xmath24 = 6 and 8 only increases the error . the mass gap plot in fig . 2",
    "is obtained using finite - size scaling by plotting mass gap versus @xmath98 and extrapolating the linear least square fit to the value corresponding to @xmath99 . in the plot",
    "the size of the symbol is larger than the error .",
    "from the inset of the plot of mass gap versus @xmath53 at various values of @xmath61 , we see that the mass gap goes to zero at @xmath100 at @xmath101 which is a significant underestimation of the transition value of @xmath102 . also on comparing with fig . 1",
    ", we again notice that the ll to cdw transition value of @xmath53 at different @xmath61 values is grossly underestimated . furthermore ,",
    "as expected , mass gap increases ( decreases ) monotonically with @xmath53 ( @xmath61 ) at a fixed @xmath61 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we will now discuss the region of validity for our model , given by eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) and as depicted in fig .",
    "3 ( region above the lower curve ) , in the two - dimensional parameter space of @xmath54 and @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , since we use the assumption that @xmath103 in our derivation , we choose the validity condition as @xmath104 .",
    "next , we would like the second order energy term @xmath105 in the perturbation series to be much smaller than the unperturbed term @xmath106 .",
    "we find that for @xmath107 , the condition @xmath108 produces a boundary on which the ratio @xmath109 with the ratio increasing rapidly as @xmath110 decreases . as for @xmath111",
    ", we find that the condition @xmath112 is more restrictive than the first one ( @xmath104 ) and produces a ratio of @xmath113 at the boundary .",
    "next we will discuss the ll to cdw phase transition boundary obtained from @xmath86 condition and depicted by the upper curve in fig .",
    "we find that the phase transition points lie within the region of validity only for @xmath114 . in the region to the right of the dashed vertical line and below the region - of - validity curve the phase boundary",
    "can not be determined using our model .",
    "it is important to note that the _ experimentally realistic parameter regime @xmath32 and @xmath31 lies mostly inside the region of validity_. upon comparing our numerical phase transition results with those of bursill _",
    "@xcite , we find that for small values of @xmath115 the critical @xmath116 values agree well .",
    "however for larger values the results do not agree . at @xmath117 our @xmath118 ( with @xmath119 and @xmath120 )",
    "is noticeably smaller than the @xmath121 of ref .",
    "@xcite and at @xmath122 we find that @xmath123 whereas bursill _",
    "get @xmath124 . as for @xmath125 ,",
    "our region of validity lies above the phase transition boundary given in ref .",
    "however , interestingly , the numerical estimates of the critical @xmath116 by hirsch and fradkin @xcite are consistent with our results with their @xmath116 value agreeing with ours at @xmath126 , while at higher values of @xmath4 their @xmath116 values lie outside our region of validity .",
    "now that the region of validity has been identified , we will analyze within this region the small parameter for our pertubation theory . for @xmath127 , one",
    "approximates @xmath128 and @xmath129 \\sim e^{2 g^2 } / { 2 g^2}$ ] with the approximations becoming exact in the limit @xmath130 .",

    "when the adiabaticity parameter @xmath133 , we have the constraints @xmath127 and @xmath134 .",
    "thus we see that , for the region @xmath133 , the polaron size parameter @xmath135 is the small parameter .",
    "now , for the extreme anti - adiabatic regime of @xmath2 , all values of @xmath54 are allowed by our model .",
    "when @xmath127 , again eq .",
    "( [ heff_sp ] ) is valid with the same small parameter @xmath136 .",
    "however , when @xmath3 , we make the approximations @xmath137 and @xmath129 \\sim 2 f_1 ( g ) $ ] with the approximations becoming exact in the limit @xmath138 . then , for @xmath3 , the effective polaronic hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) becomes @xmath139 .",

    "( [ heff_sp2 ] ) with @xmath140 corresponding to small polarons and @xmath138 ( such that @xmath141 ) corresponding to large polarons .",
    "finally , we also study the static structure factor @xmath142 .",
    "the structure factor offers information about the correlation lengths even in ll phase at all filling factors @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the correlation length decreases with increasing width of the structure factor near its peak at @xmath143 .",
    "we first observe that @xmath144 and that @xmath145 all of which are borne out by both the plots in fig .",
    "4 done at @xmath146 .",
    "the plots are only for @xmath147 with @xmath148 as @xmath149 is symmetric about @xmath150 and are only for @xmath151 because of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "4(b ) , plotted for @xmath126 and @xmath152 ( or @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) , corresponds to ll - cdw transition point at @xmath155 , while fig .",
    "4(a ) , done for the realistic values of @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( or @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) , depicts situation deep inside the cdw phase at @xmath155 .",
    "now , we know that at @xmath155 , the structure factor @xmath160 and hence diverges for @xmath161 ( cdw regime ) as @xmath162 with the divergence being faster as we go deeper inside the cdw regime . also the structure factor remains finite at @xmath143 for all other filling factors even when @xmath162 because here the system is always a ll . from plot ( a )",
    "we infer that deep inside the cdw state @xmath163 and @xmath164 . as for the cdw transition point depicted in plot ( b ) at @xmath155 ,",
    "the structure factor peaks sharply but more gradually at @xmath165 . in both plots",
    "the largest peak occurs for @xmath166 with peak size diminishing and curve width increasing as values of @xmath45 decrease .",
    "thus , we see that for @xmath167 also , short range correlations exist with correlation length decreasing as deviation from half - filling increases .",
    "lastly and importantly , using arguments similar to the 1d case , we have also derived the effective polaronic hamiltonian in @xmath5-dimensions to be @xcite @xmath168 where @xmath169 corresponds to nearest neighbor @xcite .    in conclusion",
