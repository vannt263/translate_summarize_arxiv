    "the solar radiation affects rotation of minor bodies in the solar system by two principal mechanisms : direct pressure and thermal re - radiation .",
    "the former has been shown to be of secondary importance @xcite , because its average effect is negligible .",
    "but the significance of the thermal re - radiation , known since the paper of @xcite under the name of the yorp ( yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ) effect , is generally acclaimed and empirically demonstrated @xcite .",
    "a good account of the related problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "the yorp torques acting on an irregular object are rather difficult to model . until the last year , only the results of numerical simulations were available , with the torque values generated by summing the contributions from thousands of facets of a triangulated surface @xcite .",
    "although @xcite provided a formula for the partially averaged yorp torque due to a single small triangular facet in terms of the elliptic integrals , his formulation remains of a semi - analytical type .",
    "the only known general relations between the body shape and the yorp torque consisted in the statement about the absence of yorp for spherical objects , and the ` windmill asymmetry ' as the necessary condition for its appearance @xcite .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite , if the thermal conductivity can not be neglected , the notion of the ` windmill asymmetry ' is wide enough to cover even the case of ellipsoids of revolution .",
    "the first step towards the explanation of the yorp torque values in terms of an arbitrary body shape function was made in the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "the body shape was expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and the general expressions for the mean component of the yorp torque responsible for the rotation period variations were derived within the second order approximation , i.e involving the products of shape harmonics coefficients .",
    "the resulting expressions are cumbersome , involving the products of wigner functions for the dependence on obliquity , and tabulated coefficients of power series in cosine of obliquity does not offer an explanation for the notion of the yorp order introduced in the paper . recently , this line of research has been extended to the yorp torque component responsible for variations in obliquity , with a new element  the nonzero conductivity influence @xcite , but at the moment of submission we know only the preliminary version of this article , so our comments about its content have to be rather vague .    our present contribution , developed in parallel to the work of nesvorn and vokrouhlick , is based upon similar patterns : shape description in terms of spherical harmonics , a linear , plane parallel temperature distribution model , and the second order approximation . yet , we believe that a less complicated formulation of the insolation function , that we succeeded to obtain , leads to more convenient final expressions .",
    "the wigner functions play the role of a ladder that becomes unnecessary after one climbs up to the final form of the mean yorp torque components , expressible in terms of the legendre polynomials and associated functions of order 1 . formulating the mean torque as legendre series",
    ", we introduce the notion of the yorp degree , complementary to the yorp order of @xcite , directly related to the degree of legendre functions used , and helpful when it comes to truncating the final expressions .",

    "if the lambert emission model is assumed , the thermal radiation of this element gives rise to the force @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the surface element emissivity , @xmath4 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath5 stands for the velocity of light .",
    "acting on a surface element with the radius vector from the centre of mass @xmath6 , the force produces an infinitesimal torque @xmath7 . assuming the common emissivity for all surface elements and integrating over the entire surface of the body",
    ", we obtain the net yorp torque @xmath8 the temperature @xmath1 will be considered a continuous ( but not necessarily smooth ) function of the longitude and latitude of a surface element , and of the sun position .    obviously , if the body is spherical , the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath0 are parallel , so the torque @xmath9 vanishes identically regardless of the temperature distribution function . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ m ] ) , but it leads to a second basic fact about the yorp torque : @xmath9 vanishes if the temperature distribution is isotropic , regardless of the body shape . in other words ,",
    "the mean value of the temperature over the surface is irrelevant for the computation of yorp .",

    "the presence of even degree legendre polynomials of @xmath53 in @xmath302 and of legendre functions @xmath288 in @xmath303 explains the symmetries well known from @xcite or @xcite : @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",

    "( [ eqm:3 ] ) and ( [ eqm:4 ] ) reverts this symmetry and the effect on precession is an even function of the angle @xmath307 .    in the rubincam s approximation , when we neglect the conductivity , @xmath308 and @xmath309",
    "this simplification has no effect on the spin component @xmath241 , in agreement with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the legendre functions in the formulae of section  [ sumar ] are expressed in terms of the powers of @xmath53 , we obtain exactly the same final expressions for spin component @xmath241 as @xcite . inspecting the coefficients of such expansions in @xcite",
    "one finds no rule that might help to select the leading terms , responsible for the major part of the yorp torque .",
    "the situation is much better in the present formulation , because the monotonicity properties of @xmath229 alone ( even fortified in the products @xmath310 or @xmath311 ) suggests to attach the major importance to the terms with the lowest @xmath226 values . in this context , we can justify the partition of the yorp torque terms into subsequent ` orders ' of @xmath239 , proposed by @xcite , because the index @xmath239 establishes the lower bound on the range of @xmath226 .",
    "truncating with respect to @xmath239 is also consistent with the approach of @xcite , who imposed it at the beginning of his derivation , using an insolation function that actually is restricted to the first two legendre polynomials @xmath312 and @xmath313 , with the effect of @xmath312 disappearing after the averaging .",
    "the sums presented in the previous section can be easily rearranged from the form attaching to each shape coefficients combination a sum of legendre functions , to an alternative form of legendre series with a sum of coefficients attached to each legendre function .",
    "simple manipulations lead to @xmath314 with the coefficients given as the sums @xmath315 where the lower summation bound is @xmath316 .",
    "these legendre series suggest to introduce a notion of the ` yorp degree ' , complementary to the ` yorp order ' proposed by @xcite .",
    "a term of the yorp degree @xmath317 is a sum of terms with yorp orders @xmath318 . truncating the yorp series one should first decide on the maximum degree @xmath319 , and then either maintain the maximum order @xmath239 naturally bounded by the current value of @xmath317 , or additionally impose some smaller value of @xmath320 . according to our experience",

    "the basic assumptions of our solution are similar to the ones of @xcite : almost spherical homogeneous bodies with constant albedo and small thermal penetration depth combined with low conductivity .",
    "the shape restriction is quite severe , ruling out many irregularly shaped objects like ( 433 )  eros .",
    "a good account of this difficulty was given in section 8 of @xcite .",
    "our experience confirms the statement of @xcite that qualitatively correct results can be obtained even for such irregular bodies , although the main cause of discrepancies is not the magnitude of the shape coefficients as such , but rather the occurrence of major concavities in the figure of a considered body that generates large shadow zones treated as illuminated in analytical insolation function models .",
    "so , we test our solution on a spheroid , that is obviously convex , and on the asteroid 1998  @xmath322  a reasonably regular object .      as a first test we confronted the present results with yorp torque formulae for spheroids provided by @xcite . although the results for spheroids used a simplistic thermal lag model of ` delayed sun ' , the final formulae from sect",

    "the authors were quite optimistic about this body , and indeed , a side view presented in their paper looks like well fitting the assumption of the theory .",
    "however , the polar view ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) reveals a source of possible problems when the obliquity @xmath44 is close to @xmath339 or @xmath340 . some regions , qualified as sunlit by the spherical terminator criterion are actually in shadow , whereas some sunlit regions are neglected and considered dark . apparently , these two effects cancel out in the numerical simulation , but the analytical model tends to sharpen their influence .    nevertheless , we constructed the spherical harmonics model up to degree and order @xmath341 using the least squares adjustment on the grid of 2048 surface points determined by @xcite , reduced to the reference frame of centre of mass and principal axes of inertia .",
    "the standard deviation of our harmonics set on the grid points was @xmath342 , quite satisfactory for an object with the mean radius @xmath343 .",
    "interested rather in comparison than in the dynamics of the asteroid itself , we used the same , partially fictitious values of physical parameters that were applied by @xcite : rotation period @xmath344 , density @xmath345 , orbital semi - axis @xmath346 , heat capacity @xmath347 , and albedo @xmath348 .",
    "the maximum moment of inertia , that we derived during the reduction to the principal axes , was @xmath349 .",

    "( [ m3:final ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] with the results of @xcite is as good as the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising , because we expanded our expressions in power series of @xmath53 and compared them with table  i of @xcite , concluding a perfect agreement of the numerical coefficients . yet ,",
    "when we pass to the obliquity variations @xmath351 , we find much more distortion with respect to smooth curves taken from @xcite , although the orders of magnitude and qualitative dependence on obliquity and thermal conductivity may be qualified as correct . in our opinion",
    ", the degraded accuracy at small values of @xmath44 or @xmath352 should be attributed to the north - south directed elevated patterns in the topography of @xmath335 .",
    "we have observed , that the departure from the sine - like curve of @xcite strongly depends on the maximum degree and order @xmath289 of the accounted shape harmonics . as a matter fact ,",
    "a sufficiently inaccurate shape model , with the elevated regions smoothed out , gives better shapes of the @xmath351 curve , albeit producing a smaller amplitude .",
    "although we used the same assumptions and general strategy as nesvorn and vokrouhlick ( @xcite ) , we have obtained a significantly simpler form of the final expressions of the mean yorp torque . in particular ,",
    "the final formulae are expressed in terms of legendre polynomials and associated functions , as compared to the products of wigner functions that can be found in @xcite .",
    "the advantage comes from the way we expand the insolation function  more straightforward than the one exposed in appendix  b of @xcite .",
    "our formulation is well suited for the partition into the terms of primary and secondary influence according to the yorp degree , directly related with the degree of legendre functions present in the final expressions .",
    "moreover , it has significantly better numerical properties than the power series of @xmath53 .",
    "we confirm the basic facts established in recent years , like the independence of the spin related torque component on conductivity @xcite within the plane parallel temperature model , or the presence of yorp effect in obliquity for the bodies with rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "the explicit appearance of @xmath353 in eq .",
    "( [ m3:final ] ) and the remarks about the properties of @xmath229 , neatly explain the fact that the spin related yorp torques tend to vanish close to the zeros of @xmath353 @xcite .",
    "similarly we can predict , that if the obliquity component @xmath354 has zeros different than @xmath355 or @xmath356 ( implied by each legendre function @xmath357 ) , the new zeros should be located in the domain @xmath358 ( or @xmath359 ) implied by @xmath360 .",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by a large sample of gaussian random spheres simulated in @xcite , as well as by the observed ` slivan states ' in the koronis family @xcite .",
    "the assumptions about the insolation model seem to be the main source of divergence between numerical models and a completely analytical formulation . in this context , the approach taken by @xcite seems to be a good compromise : in his paper the insolation function is derived from numerical simulation and then incorporated into an analytical treatment .",
    "as usually , however , such semi - analytical approach breaks the direct link between the shape coefficients and the yorp torque magnitude .",
    "it is a hard duty of an analytical solution to show such link , even if the final relation becomes as cumbersome as the one derived here .",
    "notably , the yorp effect in the rubincam s approximation is a second order effect in terms of the shape coefficients . which of the harmonics products will play the leading role , depends on the particular body shape , because there is no monotonicity of the numerical coefficients accompanying a particular harmonics product .",
    "it is easier to point out nonsignificant harmonics : for example , the spin torque @xmath241 is independent on the zonal harmonics coefficients @xmath361 .",
    "although the presence of the nonzero conductivity brings in the first - order terms to the @xmath362 and @xmath363 , in most cases they will be less significant than the second order contribution , because @xmath324  factoring the zonal coefficients  is typically much smaller than @xmath364 .",
    "thus the zonal harmonics coefficients are generally of minor importance , unless the body has a highly regular shape , close to a rotationally invariant solid .",
    "the modular structure of the present work allows a modification of particular elements of the solution without restarting the entire work from the scratch .",
    "our next goal is the application of a more advanced temperature solution .",
