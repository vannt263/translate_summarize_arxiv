    "( @xcite , @xcite ) have revealed its mq nature .",

    "we quote the basic properties of these three @xmath10-ray sources in table  [ table : egret ] , and the properties of the proposed x - ray counterparts in table  [ table : xray ] .",
    "there are 3 observational facts that should be noted .",
    "the first one is that ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61  303 , and probably ax  j1639.0@xmath04642 , have massive optical companions , which provide an intense stellar uv photon field . on the other hand",
    ", the compact object appears to be compatible with a neutron star in the cases of ls  5039 ( mcswain et  al .",
    "@xcite ) and ls  i  + 61  303 ( hutchings & crampton @xcite ; casares et  al , @xcite ; but see massi @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it is interesting to point out that the luminosities obtained in each spectral domain are very similar in all three sources , specially for the shorter distances to ax  j1639.0@xmath04642 , giving support to the idea that all of them have similar emission processes .    moreover , it should be noted that ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61  303 are the only microquasars having both a high - mass donor and ( possibly ) a ns as the compact object , and that there are no other microquasars ( containing low - mass donors and/or black holes ) located within the probability contours of unidentified egret sources .",
    "therefore , a strong statement can be made : hmxb / ns microquasars appear as good counterparts of low - latitude unidentified egret sources .",
    "this statement is followed by some natural questions .",
    "1 ) may ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61  303 still contain black holes ( bhs ) ?",
    "although formally possible , this is unlikely , because regarding the properties of their x - ray emission they should be in the so - called low / hard state ( fender & maccarone @xcite ) , but they do not follow the empirical correlation between x - ray and radio flux found by gallo et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in the sense that they are clearly too radio loud .",
    "2 ) why no hmxb microquasars with bhs ( e.g. , cygnus  x-1 ) are present in the third egret catalog ?",
    "a possibility is that black hole state changes may play a role , preventing the detection of gamma - ray emission when the jet is not present during the high / soft state ( but this state is very rare in the case of cygnus  x-1 and in fact , as discussed by romero et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , a low high - energy cutoff of a few hundreds in the lorentz factor of the electrons is compatible with the data ) .",
    "3 ) why no low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) microquasars are present in the third egret catalog ?",
    "one possibility is that the optical companions do not provide the necessary intense uv radiation fields needed for an effective ic process to produce high - energy gamma - rays .",
    "this possibility is strongly model dependent , and not valid if self synchrotron compton losses are dominant .",
    "the other possibility is that lmxbs are in general terms transient objects , that maybe were not active during the egret viewing periods , while hmxbs tend to be persistent systems .",
    "4 ) of course , bh and lmxb microquasars could still emit high - energy gamma - rays and not be present in the third egret catalog because of the relatively poor sensitivity threshold of the instrument .    in conclusion , persistent hmxbs containing nss not experiencing state changes are good candidates for the counterparts of the still unidentified high - energy gamma - ray sources at low - galactic latitudes ( approximately up to @xmath28 , as discussed for ls  5039 ) , and we consider that these objects may define a population among uess .",
    "observations with the future missions agile and glast will confirm or reject both the proposed associations between these microquasars and the corresponding high - energy gamma - ray sources , and the hypothesis discussed above .",
