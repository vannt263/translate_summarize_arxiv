    "recent years have seen an uprising interest in thermodynamics at atomic scale @xcite due to the latest - generation manipulation of few , if not single , elementary quantum systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems represents one of the most active research areas in the field @xcite . in this context , triggered by vast technological outcomes @xcite , the concept of quantum absorption thermal machine",
    "@xcite has been reintroduced @xcite .",
    "these machines are particularly convenient since they function without external work , extracting heat from thermal reservoirs through single atomic transitions to provide thermodynamic tasks ( e.g. , refrigeration ) .",
    "nonetheless , fundamental issues remain unsolved .",
    "a first one is the connection a single atomic transition to given thermal reservoirs , posing serious obstacles to practical realizations of such machines .",
    "a second , more theoretical issue concerns the role of quantumness .",
    "indeed , in typical models quantum features are not required @xcite , and only recently the advantages of quantum properties in thermal reservoirs have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "the role of quantum features in the machines itself is debated @xcite , so that the advantages of quantum machines over standard ones remains partially unclear .    in this paper",
    "we address both of these open problems by introducing a new quantum thermal machine setting , based on an out - of - thermal - equilibrium ( ote ) electromagnetic bath naturally ( i ) coupling to each single atomic transitions , and ( ii ) creating quantum features in the machine .",
    "the field is produced by macroscopic objects , and acts on each atomic transition as a different thermal bath at an effective temperature , hence providing all the elements needed for quantum absorption tasks .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : the physical system is introduced in section [ system ] , along with the master equation governing its dynamics , while section [ thermodynamics ] is devoted to the introduction of thermodynamic quantities characterising the heat exchanges happening between atoms and field . in section [ tasks ] the first part of the results",
    "is given , concerning the action of the machines , the different tasks it can produce and their intrinsic quantum origin .",
    "the second part of the results of this work about the machine efficiency and its carnot limit is given in section [ efficiency ] .",
    "finally , remarks and conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the setup of this paper is schematically depicted in fig . [ system ] , where a slab of thickness @xmath0 at temperature @xmath1 is placed in the blackbody radiation emitted by some walls at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the total electromagnetic field embedding the space between the slab and the walls is therefore given by the sum of four contribution : the direct blackbody radiation of the walls , the radiation emitted naturally by the slab and the walls radiation after being either reflected or transmitted by the slab .",
    "such an ote field has been studied in the context of casimir - lifshitz force and heat transfer @xcite , where its properties have been characterised in terms of the field correlators through a scattering matrix approach .",
    "the slab and the walls , macroscopic objects , are here the only ones directly connected to thermal baths .",
    "in addition , a three - level atom @xmath3 ( machine ) and a two - level atom @xmath4 ( target body ) are placed at the same distance @xmath5 from the surface of the slab and spatially separated by a distance @xmath6 .",
    "the atomic open system involves then four transitions : the body transition labeled as @xmath4 and the three machine transitions labeled as @xmath7 .",
    "transition @xmath8 connects the two lowest - lying energy eigenstates ( red transition in fig . [ scheme ] ) and transition @xmath9 the two highest ones ( green transition in fig . [ scheme ] ) .",
    "the ote field interacts with them through the hamiltonian @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dipole moment of the @xmath12-th transition of the atomic system and @xmath13 is the electromagnetic field at its position @xmath14 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the ote field . in the following",
    "we will not need the explicit expression of @xmath16 since only the field correlations will enter the master equation describing the dynamics of the atoms .",
    "the free atomic hamiltonians @xmath17 and @xmath18 have expressions @xmath19 being @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the lowering ( raising ) operator of the body @xmath4 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the lowering and raising operators of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath25 here represents a shift of the energy of each level in the @xmath26th transition due to the local interaction with the field and @xmath27 . in the third equality the renormalised transition frequencies @xmath28 for @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "have been introduced to account for the effects of the shifts @xmath25 . throughout this work",
    "we will always assume the physical consequences of such frequency renormalisation to be negligible , such that @xmath29 .",
    "this assumption has been fully confirmed by extended numerical simulations , having always detected the relative error introduced by neglecting these shifts to be less than @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth stressing here that , differently from previous works on atomic - scale thermal machines @xcite , each atomic transition interacts here with _ the same _ electromagnetic field , which embeds all the space where the atoms are placed . as we will show in what follows",
    ", there is then no need to conceive different environments , each interacting with a single atomic transition : a single non - equilibrium electromagnetic field is here able to produce all the physics needed for quantum thermodynamic tasks .      in @xcite",
    "the master equation ( me ) for two emitters in such a field has been derived under the markovian limit as @xmath31+d_{b}(\\rho)+\\sum_{n=1}^3d_n(\\rho)+d_d(\\rho),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is an effective _ field - mediated _ dipole interaction coupling resonant atomic transitions .",
    "here we assume @xmath4 and @xmath3 to be resonant through transitions at frequency @xmath34 , and all their dipoles to have the same magnitude and to lie along the line joining the two atoms , and oriented from @xmath4 to @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath35 is the effective interaction strength and @xmath20 ( @xmath36 ) is the lowering operator of the body ( of the resonant transition of the machine ) .",
    "@xmath37 originates from the correlations of the fluctuations of atomic dipoles due to the common field .",
    "the derivation of the master equation has been performed under the markovian and rotating wave approximations .",
    "it involves the average photon number @xmath38 at frequency @xmath39 and temperature @xmath40 and the two functions @xmath41 which encompass all the properties of the environment , such as the dielectric properties of the slab and the correlation functions of the field .",
    "for their explicit expressions we refer the interested reader to @xcite . the dissipative effects due to the atom - field coupling",
    "are accounted for by the dissipators @xmath42 with expressions @xmath43",
    "@xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "one recognises standard local dissipation terms ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , each associated to the degrees of freedom of a well - identified atom , and non - local dissipation ( @xmath49 ) which describes energy exchanges at frequency @xmath34 of the atomic system _ as a whole _ with its ote environment , not separable in machine or body contributions , its action involving degrees of freedom of both atoms in a symmetric way .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 ( the rates of the dissipative processes of absorption and emission of photons through local or non - local interactions ) depend on local or non - local correlations of the field in the atomic positions , which in turn are functions of the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath51 and the dielectric properties of the slab @xmath52 as @xmath53\\alpha_w^i(\\omega)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\big[1+n(\\omega , t_s)\\big]\\alpha_s^i(\\omega),\\\\ \\frac{\\gamma^-_i(\\omega)}{\\gamma^0_i(\\omega)}&=&n(\\omega , t_w)\\alpha_w^i(\\omega)^*+n(\\omega , t_s)\\alpha_s^i(\\omega)^*,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , for @xmath55 , is the vacuum spontaneous emission rate of the @xmath12-th atomic transition having a dipole moment @xmath11 , and @xmath56 .",
    "thanks to the functional dependence of these parameters on the frequency and on the position of the atom , and to the critical behaviour shown in correspondence to the resonance frequency @xmath57 of the slab material , thermodynamic tasks become achievable . to simplify the notation , in the rest of this work the explicit @xmath39-dependence in all the @xmath58s",
    "will be omitted .",
    "after having introduced all the dynamic effects characterizing the atomic system , we want in this section to introduce some quantities which will characterize the machine tasks and functioning .      in order to describe the machine thermodynamics , it is convenient to introduce two kind of temperatures . a first one characterizes the action of the field on the atoms : it has been shown @xcite that the atom - field interaction can be effectively rewritten as if each atomic transition felt a local _ equilibrium _ environment whose temperature depends on the transition frequency , on the properties of the slab and on the slab - atom distance @xmath5 .",
    "these effective _ environmental temperatures _ depend on the rates @xmath59 as @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "it is important to stress here that , despite these effective environments can be characterised by a temperature , their spectra are not simply blackbody spectra as they have their own transition - dependent purcell factor @xcite.in this framework we study thermodynamic effects of _ stationary _ heat fluxes between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , mediated and sustained by the ote environment . to characterize the effects of these fluxes a second kind of temperature has to be introduced",
    "indeed , as much as the environmental temperatures characterise the thermodynamics of the ote field , we need a second parameter to describe the energetics of atoms . in particular , atoms exchange energy under the form of heat with their surroundings by emitting photons through one of their transitions .",
    "this means that the possibility of such heat exchanges is related to the distribution of population in each atomic level .",
    "note that , from the very definition of @xmath62 , the environmental temperature depends on how the field tends to distribute atomic population in each pair of levels , due to the presence of the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "a transition is therefore in equilibrium with its effective local environment if and only if its two levels @xmath64 and @xmath65 are populated such that @xmath66 . if not , the field and the atom will exchange heat along such a transition until such a ratio is reached .",
    "this suggests to introduce a second temperature , hereby referred to as _ population temperature _ , which for a transition of frequency @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is defined as @xmath69 @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) being the stationary population of the ground ( excited ) state of the @xmath72-th transition .",
    "the result of a stationary thermodynamic task on the body , be it refrigeration , heating or population inversion , is then to modify its population temperature @xmath73 .",
    "the condition @xmath74 is satisfied only if detailed balance ( @xmath75 ) holds .",
    "it can be proven that detailed balance can be broken in a three level atom in ote fields . as a consequence the machine @xmath3 produces non - zero stationary heat fluxes with @xmath4 and the field environment , one for each dissipative process @xmath48 in the me .",
    "these fluxes , following the standard approach in the framework of markovian open quantum systems @xcite , are given as @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 is here the stationary atomic state and @xmath78 is a suitable atomic hamiltonian which can be @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath79 depending on which part of the atomic system the heat flows into .",
    "note that this definition implies an outgoing heat flux to be negative .",
    "following their definition , these heat fluxes depend both on the field properties ( through the structure of the dissipators @xmath48 ) and on the properties of the atoms through their stationary state .",
    "this dependence , for the local dissipators , can be put under the very clear thermodynamic form @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 is a positive function of @xmath83 ( and of other parameters such as the frequency of the transition ) and the second approximated equality holds in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "equation shows that the direction of heat flowing is uniquely determined by the sign of the difference @xmath85 , matching the thermodynamic expectation that heat flows naturally from the hotter to the colder body and strengthening the physical meaning of @xmath83 .",
    "there being no time - dependence in the hamiltonian of the model , the first law of thermodynamics at stationarity for the total atomic system comprises only heat terms and assumes the form @xmath86 in addition , energy is exchanged between the machine and the body thanks to their field - induced interaction @xmath37 . in appendix",
    "a , following the general scheme developed in @xcite , we show such an exchange to be under the form of heat .",

    ", one can evaluate the change in internal energy of @xmath3 due to the non - local heat flux exchanged by the atomic system with the ote environment , given by @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "it is @xmath93\\big\\}.\\ ] ] finally , the change in the internal energy of @xmath4 due to the same effect , @xmath94 $ ] , is given by same expression .    fig .",
    "[ scheme ] shows the full scheme of such heat fluxes for a particular configuration of the system .",
    "the two levels of @xmath4 will be labeled here as @xmath95 and @xmath96 . despite the two - level assumption",
    "might seem specific , it has been shown in various contexts @xcite that quantum thermal machines only couple to some effective two - level subspaces in the hilbert space of the body they are working on .",
    "a two - level system is therefore the fundamental building block of the functioning of quantum thermodynamic tasks .",
    "the main result of this paper is the possibility to drive the temperature @xmath73 of the body outside of the range defined by the external reservoirs at @xmath51 and @xmath1 .",
    "the body , without the effect of the machine , would thermalise at the local environmental temperature ( @xmath97 ) , corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "this temperature is necessarily constrained within the range @xmath99 $ ] @xcite.due to the particular form of the master equation , in which all collective atomic terms involve only resonant atomic transitions , in the non - resonant subspace the collective atomic state will be diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath100 .",
    "this is due to the fact that local dissipation in eq .",
    "of section [ system ] induces a thermalisation with respect to the free atomic hamiltonians . on the other hand , in the resonant atomic subspace of the eigenbasis of @xmath100 spanned by the states @xmath101 of @xmath4 and the two states @xmath102 of the transition of @xmath3 at frequency @xmath34 ,",
    "the most general form of the atomic stationary state is @xmath103 a coherence @xmath104 is present in the decoupled basis between the two atomic states @xmath105 and @xmath106 having the same energy .",
    "note that the temperature @xmath73 of the body increases monotonically with the ratio @xmath107 . by tracing out the machine degrees of freedom from the master equation ,",

[ temp1 ] that the machine has a very high thermal inertia , such that the body , when put into thermal contact with the machine having a certain temperature @xmath124 , thermalizes with it and @xmath135 .",

    "this drives @xmath3 out of detailed balance condition and allows @xmath3 to keep its resonant transition temperature almost constant .",
    "we label here the three transitions of the machine as high frequency ( @xmath136 ) , average frequency ( @xmath137 ) and low frequency ( @xmath138 ) , one of which ( suppose here @xmath138 , connecting states @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) is resonant with @xmath34",

    "when these two conditions are met , the machine can always redistribute its populations such that the ratio @xmath142 can be kept low and almost unaffected by the presence of another atom .",

    "this overcomes the usual difficulty of connecting single transitions to thermal reservoirs , in a realistic and simple configuration where the field - mediated atomic interaction modifies at will stationary inter - atomic energy fluxes .    despite the environmental dissipative effects , atoms share steady quantum correlations @xcite which we showed to be necessary for one atom to deliver a thermodynamic task on the other , uncovering genuinely non - classical machine functioning .",

    "moreover , such a remarkably high efficiency at maximum power is strongly connected to the presence of a peak in quantum correlations between the machine and the body , which represent the resource the machine uses for its tasks .",
