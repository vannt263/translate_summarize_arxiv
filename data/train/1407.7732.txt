    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) radiate primarily at optical wavelengths . however , optical and especially ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation is sensitive to attenuation by dust along the line of sight to the observer @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these bands are extremely crowded regions of the sn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) : generally over 100 lines lie within one doppler width of one another at any given optical wavelength , with the number approaching 1000 in the uv @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) bands of a sn  ia sed behave very differently than the uv or optical , having adjacent regions of wildly varying line opacity @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon allows one to probe the ejecta at a wide range of velocities , providing a unique window to the radiation physics of sne  ia , which in turn can constrain properties of explosion and progenitor scenarios .",
    "spectroscopic studies of nir spectra of sne  ia at both early epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and very late epochs @xcite have provided wide - ranging constraints on the distribution of unburned and partially burned nuclear white dwarf ( wd ) material , as well as the explosion energetics and @xmath2ni mass .",
    "several other studies have focused on a time - series of nir spectra which span from pre- to post - maximum light , e.g. , @xcite ; these studies have generally reached similar conclusions about post - maximum nir spectra , that they are formed primarily from iron - peak elements such as fe and co.    in this work we expand upon these studies by identifying the features in the nir spectra of four normal sne  ia during the `` transitional '' phase , a few months post - maximum light , during which the ejecta are neither photospheric nor entirely nebular .",
    "one of these objects is the recent and nearby sn  2014j , discovered by @xcite in the nearby galaxy m82 approximately 1  week after explosion .",
    "early and extensive follow - up campaigns revealed that sn  2014j is a normal sn  ia , but the environment and/or the line of sight to the explosion are highly reddened by dust @xcite .",
    "the other three sne examined in this work are sne  2001fe @xcite , 2002bo @xcite , and 2003du @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric properties of these four sne are summarized in table  [ objsum ] ; all four are relatively normal sne , with the exception of some high - velocity features in sne  2002bo and 2014j .",
    "because several objects comprise our `` time - series '' of nir spectra , we do not seek in this work to characterize the time - evolution of any particular spectroscopic feature , as it is difficult to separate the intrinsic variability of the ejecta of each sn from age - dependent effects in a given spectrum .",
    "rather , our purpose is to identify common features in each spectrum , and to infer properties inherent to our entire sample which may provide useful diagnostic tools in the study of larger samples or of a high - cadence time - series of nir spectra of a single object which includes these epochs . in section [ sec : obs ] we describe our observations of sn  2014j ; in section [ sec : num_mod ] we present the numerical methods involved in calculating synthetic spectra ; in section [ sec : discussion ] we compare our results to the nir observations ; and finally in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our work .",
    "we obtained two observations of sn 2014j with triplespec , a cross - dispersed infrared spectrograph mounted on the 3.5  meter telescope at apache point observatory on 2014 april 8 and 2014 april 11 . at this epoch",
    "sn  2014j had nir apparent magnitudes of approximately @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these data are the first of a pilot project to generate a wide - ranging data set of nir spectra and photometry of nearby ( @xmath6 ) sne  ia at post - maximum and late - time epochs using triplespec .",
    "the observations were made with the 1@xmath71 x 43@xmath70 slit , yielding resolution @xmath8 data from 0.95  @xmath0 m    2.46  @xmath0 m , and were obtained using a standard abba nod sequence .",
    "observations of a nearby a0v star were obtained immediately after our observations of sn 2014j to facilitate accurate telluric subtraction .",
    "table [ obssum ] summarizes the details of our observations , including the individual exposure times and total on - source integration times for sn 2014j and our a0v calibrators .    these data were flat - fielded , wavelength calibrated , and extracted using triplespectool , a modified version of spextool @xcite .",
    "the data were corrected for telluric features using observations of nearby a0v stars at similar airmass to sn 2014j following the techniques outlined in @xcite .",
    "we also performed absolute flux calibration using the a0v telluric stars , following @xcite : when combining the individual sn and stellar spectra , we scaled each to the mean computed in high signal - to - noise regions of the spectra .",
    "the relative fluxes presented here are unaffected by these processes .",
    "our two sn  2014j observations were obtained at significantly different hour angles and airmasses . as optimal removal of telluric features",
    "is achieved by minimizing the angular distance and airmass difference between science and a0v calibrator @xcite , we utilized different a0v calibrators for our two epochs of observations ( see table  [ obssum ] ) .",
    "the spectra have been deredshifted by @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 using m82 data from ned and dereddened using @xmath11 and @xmath12  mag for m82 and @xmath13 and @xmath14  mag for the milky way , following the estimates of @xcite , although the reddening effects of dust from both galaxies are negligible in the nir .    for comparison we plot alongside our sn  2014j spectra four transitional - phase nir spectra :",

    "all six spectra are shown in figure  [ fig:01fe_03du_14j ] , with the flux of each multiplied by an arbitrary factor to facilitate comparison of spectral features .",
    "to generate model spectra we used the radiative transfer code ` phoenix/1d ` ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which solves the spherically symmetric , special relativistic radiative transfer equation , correct to all orders in @xmath15 , along with the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) equations of statistical equilibrium . it also accounts for non - thermal processes such as @xmath16-ray and positron deposition , and includes a complete treatment of line blanketing .",
    "our models contain approximately 100,000 wavelength points .",
    "we calculated synthetic spectra of a spherically symmetric delayed - detonation explosion model described in @xcite , which reproduces the light curves and spectra for core - normal supernovae @xcite . in this realization ,",
    "the carbon / oxygen wd is from the core of an evolved 5  @xmath17 main - sequence star . through accretion",
    ", this core approaches the chandrasekhar mass , and an explosion begins spontaneously when the core has a central density of @xmath18  g  @xmath19 and a total mass of 1.36  @xmath17 .",
    "the transition from deflagration to detonation is triggered artificially at a density of @xmath20  g  @xmath19 .",
    "the model abundances are shown in figure  [ fig : pah_std ] , with @xmath2ni plotted at @xmath21 and all other species plotted at @xmath22 such that , e.g. , the mass of fe includes the stable fe produced at @xmath21 as well as all of the decayed @xmath2ni .",
    "the explosion produces 0.64  @xmath17 of @xmath2ni and 0.09  @xmath17 of stable @xmath1ni .",
    "we generated a unique synthetic spectrum to correspond to each of the six observed spectra , assuming each sn had a rise time of 15  d. for example , the synthetic spectrum corresponding to the day + 67 spectrum of sn  2014j had a homologous expansion time of 82  d. while it is unlikely that all six sne indeed had rise times of that period , the variation in rise times ( likely a few days ) should not affect the spectra significantly , given how slowly they evolve at these epochs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our purpose here is to identify spectral features , not to quantify the time - evolution of a given sn ( a difficult task given the dearth of available post - maximum nir spectra ) .",
    "only two significant differences exist between the numerical methods used in previous ` phoenix ` calculations and the ones presented here . in earlier works",
    ", we enforced radiative equilibrium via the modified unsld - lucy algorithm @xcite , where the total bolometric luminosity in the observer s frame is specified at the outer boundary and the @xmath15 moment equations are integrated to obtain the values of the radiation energy density @xmath23 and flux @xmath24 in the comoving frame . here , we have instead chosen to solve directly the time - independent @xmath15 radiation energy equation @xcite , @xmath25 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 are the radiation energy density , flux , and pressure , respectively , integrated over all wavelenths ; @xmath27 is the emissivity , @xmath28 is the total opacity ( absorption and scattering ) , and @xmath29 is the rate of deposition of non - thermal energy due to radiative decay of @xmath2ni and @xmath2co , in the form of @xmath16-rays and positrons . by solving equation  [ eq : energy_eqn ]",
    "directly we do not specify a target luminosity at all . in this way",
    "we enforce energy conservation ( heating  =  cooling ) and the luminosity is given by the total emission from the entire ejecta which is now powered by radioactive energy deposition ( contained in @xmath29 in equation  [ eq : energy_eqn ] ) .",
    "the second difference is that here we have treated all line opacity in full nlte , rather than parameterizing the opacity for weak lines as discussed in @xcite .",
    "every term in equation  [ eq : energy_eqn ] except for @xmath29 is a function of the gas temperature @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the temperature - dependence of each of these terms is highly non - linear ; therefore this equation requires iteration to solve . to do so , we first choose two successive temperatures guesses for each point in the ejecta .",
    "are obtained iteratively , it is difficult to obtain analytic temperature derivatives which are required for newton - raphson iteration .",
    "we therefore are relegated to using the secant method , which follows the same procedure as the newton - raphson method except with numerical derivatives .",
    "the disadvantage of the secant method is that it requires two initial conditions instead of just one .",
    "however , as long as both initial guesses are near the correct solution , the converged solution is independent of their values . ]",
    "we next iterate the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) rate equations , approximate @xmath31-iteration , and the equation of state until all three are globally converged for the given temperature .",
    "then we apply the secant method to equation  [ eq : energy_eqn ] to obtain a new temperature guess .",
    "finally , we repeat the latter two steps until equation  [ eq : energy_eqn ] is satisfied is below 1% . ] at all points in the ejecta .",
    "the observed nir spectra shown in figure  [ fig:01fe_03du_14j ] are fairly similar",
    ". however there are a few interesting differences , including the lines from 1.9  @xmath0 m    2.5  @xmath0 m in sn  2001fe and sn  2003du which are narrow and slightly blueshifted compared to sne  2002bo and 2014j .",
    "in addition , sn  2003du also may exhibit _ two _ emission features between 2.3  @xmath0 m  2.4  @xmath0 m ( although it is not easy to distinguish this possibility from the noise ) , while the other three sne show only a single feature .",
    "if it is indeed two distinct features , it is possible that they are present in all three sne , and that only in sn  2003du are the velocities low enough for them to appear unblended .",
    "if this were the case , one might attribute the lower velocity to an age effect , since sn  2003du s @xmath32-band spectrum is the oldest of those shown in figure  [ fig:01fe_03du_14j ] .",
    "however , we believe this explanation is unlikely , given how slowly nir spectra appear to change in the catalog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cf . their figure  9 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the ejecta in the explosion of sn  2003du had a different @xmath2ni distribution than in sn  2001fe or sn  2014j , or that the velocity gradient of the line - emitting region is narrower in this object than in the others .",
    "figure  [ fig : phx_no_forb_vs_14j ] shows the ` phoenix ` synthetic spectrum compared to sn  2014j at day + 67 , with the model spectrum scaled such that the predicted flux matches the observation at 1.00  @xmath0 m .",
    "( we apply the same scaling procedure in all comparisons of models and observations . ) the calculation used to generate this spectrum included no forbidden lines .",
    "most features in the synthetic spectrum match those in the observed spectrum quite well .",
    "the primary shortcoming in the synthetic spectrum is the emission feature at 1.98  @xmath0 m in sn  2014j which is not reproduced in the model .    in order to determine which atomic species and lines are responsible for which spectral features , we calculate `` single - ion spectra '' using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectra for the most influential ions are shown in figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_no_forb_vs_14j ] .",
    "these single - ion spectra indicate that nearly every feature in the nir spectrum of sn  2014j can be accounted for with permitted lines of and . in particular , dominates the nir spectrum blueward of 1.50  @xmath0 m , and dominates the spectrum redward of that point .",
    "this result agrees with the conclusions of @xcite , who focused on the optical wavelengths of normal sn  ia seds during the transitional phase , and @xcite , who showed that fluorescence of iron - peak and intermediate - mass elements produces much of the post - maximum nir spectrum in the normal sn  2005cf .    anticipating the possibility that forbidden lines play a role in nir spectrum formation at these epochs",
    ", we have repeated the calculations of this model , including the forbidden lines in @xcite and the nist atomic spectral database @xcite for all species with @xmath33 through @xmath34 ( carbon through nickel ) . comparing the permitted - line - only and the permitted - and - forbidden line spectra",
    "will then reveal the role that forbidden lines play during these epochs and in these nir bands . because changing the atomic data changes the problem that is actually solved ( forbidden emission acts as an extra coolant which affects the temperature of the ejecta ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we re - converged the entire model after adding these extra lines .",
    "the resulting spectrum , along with the corresponding single - ion spectra , is shown in figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_forb_vs_14j ] .",
    "we also show the corresponding temperature structure @xmath35 for both models in figure  [ fig : temps ] in order to illustrate the cooling effects of forbidden lines .",
    "we calculated a synthetic spectrum corresponding to each of the six observed spectra , which together are plotted in figure  [ fig : phx_forb_vs_all_obs ] .",
    "the addition of forbidden lines does lower the temperature , as discussed in @xcite , but the effect is fairly small , even at this epoch .",
    "the few features which fe and co alone do not produce , merit additional scrutiny .",
    "these include the emissions at 1.15  @xmath0 m , 1.20  @xmath0 m , and 1.98  @xmath0 m .",
    "we discuss identifications of each of these below .",
    "figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_no_forb_vs_14j ] suggests that the emission at 1.15  @xmath0 m could be due to a combination of and , , and .",
    "our model atoms , comprised mostly from the sources listed in @xcite and @xcite , predict 52 lines , 56 lines , 7 lines , and 30 lines , all within the range 1.14  @xmath0 m  1.16  @xmath0 m ; more detailed level population analysis would be required to identify which of these is forming the emission seen in the single - ion spectra . that the composite synthetic spectrum does not reproduce these features of the intermediate mass elements very well",
    "is possibly due to deficiencies in the hydrodynamical model or in the gas temperature calculation .",
    "adding forbidden lines to the calculation complicates the identification of this emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_forb_vs_14j ] shows that the strongest components at that wavelength after are now and , followed by and . because the composite ` phoenix ` spectrum does not fit that feature very well , it is difficult to say which of these is responsible .      in the permitted - line only spectrum ( figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_no_forb_vs_14j ] ) , the emission near 1.20  @xmath0 m is likely due to a blend of lines ( there are 38 within in the range 1.19  @xmath0 m  1.21  @xmath0",
    "m ) , , ( there are 6 within the same range ) , and ( 45 lines ) . as with the 1.15  @xmath0 m feature , inclusion of forbidden lines",
    "complicates identification of this emission .",
    "a number of lines strengthen at nearby wavelengths , but remains the strongest component after .",
    "no ion in the permitted - line - only spectrum in figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_no_forb_vs_14j ] appears able to reproduce the emission at 1.98  @xmath0 m .",
    "however , addition of forbidden line data produces a strong emission feature in the synthetic spectrum near that wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_forb_vs_14j ] indicates that the emission is due to [ ] , which we identify as @xmath36 .",
    "this emission feature produced in the synthetic spectrum is too blue by about 0.5  @xmath0 m compared to the corresponding feature in sne  2014j ( figure  [ fig : phx_single_ion_forb_vs_14j ] ) .",
    "curiously , this shortcoming is repeated in all of the other sne in our sample ( see figure  [ fig : phx_forb_vs_all_obs ] ) .",
    "the spectral coverage of sn  2002bo at both day + 56.5 and day + 85 unfortunately does not span this region and so we can not study the influence of [ ] in that object . an explosion model which leaves the @xmath1ni more concentrated at the center may cause the nickel emission to shift redward slightly , providing a better match to the three sne  ia with available spectral coverage studied in this work .",
    "this [ ] emission appears in our sn ia sample to be consistently redward of its appearance in our models .",
    "in addition , its location in our model spectra does not change over the 30-day time frame spanned in this work : the emission center is at @xmath37  @xmath0 m , very near the center of the line rest wavelength .",
    "it is possible that the systematic redshift of this feature in our sample of observations is due to to asymmetrical explosions combined with a line - of - sight effect , as doppler shifts of optically thin emission lines are sensitive to hydrodynamical asymmetries @xcite .",
    "if asymmetry is indeed the explanation for this observed redshift , then this feature may possess great utility as a probe of asymmetry at quite early epochs of a sn  ia , assuming a complete and high - quality series of nir spectra can be obtained .",
    "given the model age of @xmath38  d , the radioactive @xmath2ni , with a half - life of @xmath39  d , has all but disappeared .",
    "therefore the [ ] which produces the emission feature at this epoch ( the feature is present in varying degrees in all sne in figure  [ fig:01fe_03du_14j ] except sn  2002bo , which lacks the necessary spectral coverage ) must instead be a stable isotope , specifically @xmath1ni , which is a product of high - density nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "the [ ] emission in the series of model spectra shown in figure  [ fig : phx_forb_vs_all_obs ] exhibits similar behavior to , e.g. , the [ ] and [ ] lines which appear in optical spectra in the nebular phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strengthening as the optical depth of the inner regions of the ejecta decreases and more of the central @xmath1ni is exposed .",
    "although the wavelength of the [ ] emission in figure  [ fig : phx_forb_vs_all_obs ] does not change over the 30 days spanned by the models , it does strengthen noticeably .",
    "we estimate then that a series of moderate - cadence ( periods of @xmath40 days ) nir observations of individual sne  ia during these epochs would provide the information necessary to confirm or refute this identification of @xmath1ni in this particular hydrodynamical model .",
    "( observations with longer periods would also resolve the strengthening of this emission , but may be unable to determine the time scale over which it evolves . )",
    "they would likely also allow models to constrain the amount of @xmath1ni produced in the explosion , since the strength of the [ ] emission should vary with the mass of @xmath1ni .",
    "( in this particular model the mass ratio of stable @xmath1ni to radioactive @xmath2ni is @xmath41 , a typical value for delayed - detonation explosion models . ) if the @xmath1ni identification is correct , observations with such a cadence would be able to track the doppler shift of this feature ( or lack thereof ) , thereby constraining its velocity extent .",
    "however , given this emission feature s close proximity to a heavily polluted telluric region , the sites for such observations would need to be selected carefully , i.e. , at high elevation .",
    "sne  ia at higher redshift would exhibit a lower signal - to - noise ratio , but this emission feature in those objects would be less susceptible to telluric contamination .",
    "besides @xmath1ni , mn is also a product of high - density burning , and so if the ( tentative ) identification of at 1.15  @xmath0 m is correct , this would provide a second indication that such burning took place in sne 2001fe , 2002bo , 2003du , and 2014j , presumably during the deflagration phase of the delayed - detonation explosion .",
    "@xcite showed that the layered structure apparent in the early optical and nir spectra of sn  2014j is consistent with a delayed - detonation explosion model .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the mass and distribution of radioactive @xmath2ni in sn  2014j is consistent with a near - chandrasekhar - mass explosion , consistent with our results .",
    "sub - chandrasekhar explosion models tend to underproduce neutron - rich elements such as @xmath1ni @xcite , and so the nir and [ ] spectral signatures presented here may provide useful proxies for diagnosing near - chandrasekhar - mass explosions .",
    "we have presented nir synthetic spectra of a sn  ia delayed - detonation hydrodynamical model at epochs spanning from @xmath42  d through @xmath43  d , corresponding roughly to the ages of the nir spectra of sne  2001fe , 2002bo , 2003du , and 2014j spanning from days + 56.5 through + 85 , which at these epochs are undergoing the transition from the photospheric to nebular phase .",
    "we found that our model reproduces most features in the nir spectrum with permitted lines of and , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "only a few other species contribute appreciably to the nir spectrum , including , , , and at 1.15  @xmath0 m , and and possibly at 1.20  @xmath0 m .",
    "the emission at 1.98  @xmath0 m seen in three of the four sne  ia studied here is the only feature which arises from forbidden lines in our model ; it is due to forbidden lines of [ ] .",
    "that the emission is so strong indicates a significant mass of stable @xmath1ni in the ejecta ( our model has 0.09  @xmath17 ) , produced during the early stages of the explosion of the wd progenitor .",
    "the evidence for [ ] and possibly of lines implies burning at high density , suggesting that the progenitors of these three sne  ia ignited at nearly the chandrasekhar mass .",
