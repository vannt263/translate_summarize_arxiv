    "it has been known since the 1950s that spiral galaxy morphology can be a strong function of wavelength ( zwicky 1955 ) .",
    "different bandpasses transmit differing amounts of light from young versus old stellar populations , and are affected by dust extinction in different ways .",
    "classical galaxy morphology is based on blue - sensitive photographic data , and is thus strongly influenced by the distribution of recent star formation and dust . over the last two decades it has become increasingly clear that the underlying distribution of the old stellar mass , as traced by red , or near - infrared ( nir ) imaging , can be quite different than the @xmath6-band morphology ( e.g. , hackwell & schweizer 1983 ; block et al .",
    "1994 ; frogel , quillen & pogge 1996 ; eskridge et al .",
    "the ability to image galaxies in the vacuum ultraviolet increases the lever - arm over which we can study the wavelength dependence of galaxy morphology , and can allow us to draw a sharp distinction between uv - bright regions and the nir luminosity distribution . in the @xmath6-band , even actively star - forming galaxies have a significant contribution to their flux from stars as old as a few gyr ( e.g. , sage & solomon 1989 ) . by contrast , in the vacuum ultraviolet nearby late - type galaxies are dominated by regions of current unobscured active star formation .",
    "the spiral arms are prominent , as are star - forming rings ( if present ) , and the bulges are weak or not visible at all ( e.g. , kuchinski et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; marcum et al .  2001",
    "; windhorst et al .",
    "the distribution of current , unobscured , active star formation in a galaxy , provided by the ultraviolet morphology , offers us a map of the dynamically interesting places in the disk .",
    "the distribution of the old stars , from red or nir imaging , tells us about the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "one means of examining multicolor imaging data of unresolved sources is to examine the properties of the image stack on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "this approach has recently been advocated by abraham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but was first discussed by bothun ( 1986 ) .",
    "abraham et al .  ( 1999 ) made pixel color - color diagrams , and found relationships between location in these color - color diagrams and physical location within the target galaxy .",
    "they used _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images of faint intermediate - redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field , taken with the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . in this paper , we bring the technique back to @xmath7 and apply it to the study of star formation in nearby spirals .",
    "our data include moderately deep hst / wfpc2 exposures for the spiral galaxies ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 in two bandpasses ( f300w or @xmath0 , and f814w or @xmath2 ) .",
    "we also have a shallow f255w ( or @xmath3 ) image of ngc 6782 . as we have moderately deep images in only two bandpasses , we adopt the approach of bothun ( 1986 ) , who first made a pixel color - magnitude diagram ( pcmd ) for ngc 4449 .",
    "the advantages we have over bothun s earlier work derive from the special attributes of the hst / wfpc2 combination .",
    "as hst is in orbit , we can take data in the vacuum ultraviolet as well as the red part of the optical bandpass .",
    "this gives us a larger spectral baseline to work with .",
    "the other , somewhat paradoxical , advantage is that wfc images are undersampled .",
    "this has the consequence that individual pixels are statistically independent .",
    "thus well - aligned multiband images with wfpc2 provide a set of statistically independent pixels , each of which contains information on the stars within it .",
    "each pixel contains a mix of different stellar populations , dust and gas , and can be treated as a distinct physical unit , similar in some ways to the study of star clusters .",
    "the number and band - passes of the available images determines the sorts of information a given data - set will probe .",
    "the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath2 images we have available is primarily sensitive to the relative fractions of young and old stellar populations .",
    "traditional studies of the structure and contents of galactic disks are based on radial , azimuthally averaged , color and surface - brightness profiles ( e.g. , kormendy 1977 ; kent 1985 ; walterbos & kennicutt 1987 ; de jong 1996 ; baggett , baggett & anderson 1998 ; de grijs 1998 ; peng et al .  2002 ) .",
    "this washes out any small - scale effects ( due , for instance , to spiral arms and interarm regions ) .",
    "we combine these more traditional approaches with the pixel - mapping technique to gain a fuller picture of the distribution of stellar populations in the disks of spirals .",
    "our targets for this study are both bright , nearly face - on early- to mid - type spiral galaxies . because of their small angular size ( they fit well within the wfpc2 field of view )",
    ", they are the only two galaxies from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey sample ( eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) to have been included in the hst uv imaging sample of windhorst et al .",
    "both galaxies were previously known to be uv sources ( bowyer et al .",
    "the basic properties of the target galaxies are given in table 1 . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations in detail , discuss steps we have taken to address the red leak of the uv filters , and present our adopted photometric calibration .",
    "we present the @xmath0@xmath8 pcmds for both galaxies in  3 . in ",
    "4 we show the pixel color - color diagram including the @xmath3 data for ngc 6782 .",
    "we discuss these results in  5 . in  6 we present our conclusions , and suggestions for further research .",
    "the data for this study are a set of uv and optical images obtained with the wfpc2 on board hst . for both ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 , we have hst wfpc2 images taken through the f300w and f814w filters . for ngc 6782",
    "we also have an image obtained through the f255w filter .",
    "details of the observations are given in table 2 .",
    "the nuclei of the target galaxies were placed on the wf3 chip . in figure 1",
    "we show @xmath9 sections of the wf3 images , centered on the galaxy nuclei .",
    "these data were obtained as part of the hst program 8645 , `` a survey of mid - uv morphology of nearby galaxies : galaxy structure and faint galaxy evolution '' ( r.  windhorst pi ) .",
    "details of the program and data reduction are given in windhorst et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the f300w filter has significant secondary throughput from @xmath106600  to @xmath101@xmath11 m .",
    "thus , if one wishes to do good quantitative work with wfpc2 f300w images , one must consider and correct for the effects of red leak .",
    "one of our technical justifications for obtaining images with the f814w filter was to allow for good red - leak correction to the @xmath0 images ; the band - pass of the f814w filter is very similar to that of the f300w red leak ( see windhorst et al .",
    ".    as both ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 are early - type spirals , they are likely to be brighter in the wavelength regime of the red leak than they are in the nuv .",
    "one can make a very simple worst - case estimate of the red leak as follows : the red leak can not account for any more than all of the counts in any given area of a few pixels of an @xmath0 image .",
    "one can therefore take the @xmath2 image , and iteratively scale it until one finds a maximum possible red - leak contamination on these grounds ( that is when all of the counts in any region of the @xmath0 image are actually due to red leak ) .",
    "we note that this is almost certainly an overestimate of the red leak , as the old stars that dominate the emission in the @xmath2 image will also emit some nuv photons .",
    "but even in this most extreme case , there is no substantial qualitative difference between the uncorrected and corrected @xmath0 frames for our targets . to understand why this is so , note in figure 1 that the light profiles of both galaxies are strongly peaked in the @xmath2-band , but only weakly peaked in the @xmath0",
    "thus , when the @xmath2-band images are scaled with the constraint that the subtracted image has no significant negative regions , this has the effect that the subtracted images reach zero counts in the dust lanes around the nuclei , while the nuclei themselves , and the surrounding regions of star formation are nearly unaffected .",
    "one can attempt a more accurate assessment of the red leak in a number of ways .",
    "one relatively simple method is to fold model galaxy spectra through the response functions of the hst+wfpc2+f814w and f300w combinations , and measure the expected red leak for various input spectra .",
    "we undertook this experiment using spectral models from the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) atlas , as implemented in the _ synphot _ package ( bushouse & simon 1998 ) within stsdas .",
    "we proceeded as follows : for our two targets , we measured the total counts in dn ( all our data were obtained at a gain of 7 electrons / dn ) in the f814w frames within a circular aperture of a radius of 20 pixels centered on the nucleus .",
    "the smooth , old stellar populations dominate both galaxies in this region .",
    "we then used a set of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models to derive @xmath2-band magnitudes consistent with the measured f814w count rates .",
    "the models we used were a pure single burst model with an age of @xmath12 yr , a @xmath12 year old model with an exponentially decreasing star - formation rate and an e - folding time of 1 gyr , and a @xmath12 year old model with a constant star - formation rate .",
    "for each of these models , we then used our derived @xmath2-band magnitudes to predict the f300w count rate in the wavelength range 6000  to 12000 , and used the integration times of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 images to derive the appropriate scale factors to apply to the @xmath2 images .",
    "we then subtracted the scaled @xmath2 image from the @xmath0 image .",
    "details of these models are given in table 3 , where row 1 shows the observed @xmath2 count rate ( in dn ) in the 20-pixel aperture , row 2 shows the observed @xmath0 count rate in the same aperture , row 3 shows the implied @xmath2-band aperture magnitude , row 4 shows the red leak @xmath0 count rate for the model , and row 5 shows the fraction of the observed counts in the aperture that are due to red leak .",
    "we have also made empirical red - leak corrections , using template spectra from the kinney atlas ( kinney et al .",
    "we use their sa ( for ngc 6782 ) and sb ( for ngc 6753 ) template spectra .",
    "our procedure for the kinney atlas templates is the same as outlined above for the model templates , and the results are included in table 3 .",
    "both the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) model spectra and the kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) empirical templates give consistent results .",
    "the f300w red leak does not have any qualitative effect on the nuv morphology of our target galaxies . even in the nuclei , the red leak accounts for @xmath1310% of the counts in the nuv images of either galaxy .",
    "further , the range in red - leak correction factors for all the templates considered is only a fraction of a percent in both galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the f300w red leak does not have any qualitative effect on the nuv morphology .    for the f255w image of ngc 6782",
    ", we make no attempt at red - leak correction .",
    "first , the f255w redleak is at @xmath104000 , and we have no hst images at this wavelength .",
    "second , the total counts in a 20 pixel radius aperture , centered on the nucleus are consistent with 0 .",
    "thus there simply is no room in the data for a significant red leak .",
    "we note that the wfpc2 handbook ( biretta et al .",
    "2000 ) also shows that the f255w red leak is also significantly smaller than the f300w red leak .",
    "we adopt the photometric calibration from the stsci documents archive ( http://www.stsci.edu/documents/dhb/web/c32_wfpc2dataanal.fm1.html ) , dated 01 july 1998 .",
    "the adopted wf3 gain-7 zeropoints are given in table 4 .",
    "to compute magnitudes from a given count rate , we adopt the relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total counts , @xmath16 is the exposure time , and @xmath17 is the zeropoint for the filter .",
    "these calibrations are based on those given by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , with corrections due to the aging of the detectors .",
    "our photometry is thus on the vegamag system .",
    "the basic reduction of the data in this paper is described in detail in windhorst et al .",
    "an issue that requires further attention for this study is sky subtraction .",
    "we measured the sky levels in the original images after the stsdas `` on - the - fly '' pipeline calibration , but before cosmic - ray clipping ( the cosmic - ray clipping routine must add small constants to each image to bring all images onto one common sky ) .",
    "table 4 gives our measured sky level in each band in units of magnitude per square arcsecond .",
    "we use a pixel - mapping technique ( bothun 1986 ; abraham et al .  1999 ) to examine the data .",
    "as we have only two moderately deep images per galaxy , we present this information in the form of pcmds .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0@xmath1 pcmds for ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 .",
    "there are two or three bright foreground stars in each image that can create spurious features in the pcmds ( one is visible in the lower right corner of the image sections of ngc 6782 in fig .  1 ) . after masking out these bright stars ,",
    "we plot all pixels with at least three counts ( dn ) in both the sky - subtracted , red - leak - corrected @xmath0 and the @xmath2 images . in practice",
    ", the signal limit is always reached in the @xmath0 image first . the wfpc2 handbook ( biretta et al .",
    "2000 ) gives an effective gain of @xmath18 electrons per dn , and a read - noise of 5.22 electrons for wf3 at gain-7 .",
    "our data were obtained at a detector temperature of @xmath19 , giving a dark current of 0.0045 electrons per second .",
    "these , plus our measured sky brightness in the @xmath0 ( see table 4 ) and exposure times ( see table 2 ) allow us to compute the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) in the @xmath0 for a limiting number of 3 dn per pixel . for ngc 6753 ( two 950 second exposures ) , this works out to a @xmath20 . for ngc 6782 ( three 500 second exposures )",
    ", we have @xmath21 .    on the right margins of figure 2",
    "we show the absolute magnitude scale for the @xmath0 data for our assumed distances ( see table 1 ) . for these distances , a wf3 pixel subtends approximately 20 pc for ngc 6753 and 25 pc for ngc 6782 .",
    "the data have been corrected for foreground extinction using the extinction map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) , and the reddening law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "the arrows in figure 2 show reddening vectors for one magnitude of absorption in @xmath22 , using the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law .",
    "interior to the left - hand margins of fig .",
    "2 we show the apparent surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond .",
    "there are a number of clear features in the pcmds",
    ". plumes of very red pixels ( shown as black points in fig .",
    "2 ) extend up to @xmath23 in both galaxies .",
    "for ngc 6753 , this plume is at @xmath24 , whilst for ngc 6782 it is at @xmath25 . although this difference in color is not statistically significant , we speculate that it may be due to a slightly higher internal extinction in ngc 6753 , as ngc 6753 is a later - type galaxy than ngc 6782 .",
    "these red plumes are likely to be due to areas that are dominated by the old stellar populations , with little or no on - going massive star formation ( see  5.3 below ) .",
    "both systems show two separate and parallel blue plumes in the pcmds , separated by roughly a magnitude in @xmath1 color .",
    "these plumes extend up to @xmath26 in both galaxies , although they cease to be distinct from one another brighter than @xmath27 for ngc 6753 . in both galaxies , we shall refer to the redder of the blue plumes as `` blue plume 1 '' ( shown as red points in fig .",
    "2 ) , and the bluer of the blue plumes as `` blue plume 2 '' ( shown as green points in fig .  2 ) .",
    "in fig .  2a , the horizontal line at @xmath28 marks the bright limit at which the blue plumes appear seperate .",
    "points above this line are plotted in teal in fig .",
    "the relative density of points in the two plumes is very different in the two galaxies . in ngc 6753 , blue plume 1 is the more densely populated , whilst in ngc 6782 it is blue plume 2 .",
    "the plumes run nearly parallel to the extinction vector .",
    "this means that the distribution of pixels within a given plume may be driven entirely by the amount of extinction in the direction of that pixel .",
    "it also means that the separation between the plumes can not be an extinction effect .",
    "there are also collections of pixels blueward of the prominent blue plumes in both galaxies ( show as blue points in fig .  2 ) .",
    "in ngc 6782 , this population is clearly separated in @xmath1 from blue plume 2 . in ngc 6753",
    ", it forms a blue extension of blue plume 2 , and is not clearly separated in color .",
    "finally , in ngc 6753 there is a spur emerging from the blue edge of the red plume ( shown as magenta points in fig .",
    "2a ) , at @xmath293.0 , extending up to @xmath30 , and running parallel to the blue plumes .",
    "we have added solid lines to fig .  2 to demarcate these regions of the pcmds .",
    "we have also used these boundaries to separate the pixels according to physical location in their host galaxies .",
    "we show these distributions in figure 3 for ngc 6753 and figure 4 for ngc 6782 , with the same color coding as in fig .",
    "2 ( the red - plume pixels plotted in black , the blue - plume-1 pixels plotted in red , the blue - plume-2 pixels plotted in green , and the very blue pixels plotted in blue ) .",
    "a truly remarkable pattern emerges : the features that are isolated in the pcmds represent very sharply bounded radial regimes in both galaxies , and in both cases there is a strict progression in color , with the reddest features in the pcmds coming from the centers of the galaxies , and the bluest features from the largest radii . in ngc 6753",
    ", blue plume 1 corresponds to pixels in the inner ring ( buta 1995 ) .",
    "the blue - plume-2 pixels are from the spiral arms outside this inner ring . in ngc 6782",
    "both the blue plumes correspond to pixels in the nuclear ring ( buta 1995 ) , the the seperation between the plumes being the strong absorption lanes visible in fig .  1 .",
    "the very blue pixels in ngc 6782 are in the inner ring ( buta 1995 ) .",
    "the separation of the blue plumes in color space is a very curious feature .",
    "metallicity gradients , dust distribution patterns , and smooth radial declines in @xmath2-band surface brightness can all produce a bluing trend with increasing radius , but the gaps between features in color space indicate that there is more to the story than this .    in figure 5 , we show @xmath0@xmath2 magnitude - magnitude plots ( expressed as magnitudes per pixel ) for the two galaxies .",
    "these plots indicate that the pixels in a given blue plume have a nearly constant @xmath2-band surface brightness , and a large range in @xmath0 surface brightness .",
    "conversely , in both galaxies the two blue plumes have nearly the same range in @xmath0 surface brightness , and are seperated by about a magnitude in @xmath2-band surface brightness .",
    "thus the separation of the blue plumes is due to drops in the @xmath2-band surface brightness at particular radii .",
    "further , as the @xmath0 surface brightness distribution is the same in the two plumes , this means the drops in the @xmath2-band surface brightness have essentially no effect on the absolute strength of the on - going unobscured star formation .",
    "we speculate that the abrupt changes in the @xmath2-band surface brightness are due to dynamical effects in the disks of the galaxies that govern the long - term global star formation in the disks .",
    "we discuss this matter further in  5 , below .",
    "as we obtained an @xmath3 image of ngc 6782 , in addition to the @xmath0 and @xmath2-band images , we examined the @xmath5@xmath1 color - color plot . unfortunately , there are very few pixels with a significant number of counts in the @xmath3 image .",
    "all the photons are from the star - forming ring ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to only those pixels with at least 3 dn in the the @xmath0 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath2-band images , and 2 dn ( @xmath32 ) in the @xmath3 image ( the formal limit of 3 dn on the @xmath2 image is never reached in practice ) .",
    "when we look at the distribution of these pixels in physical space , we find that they are from three spatially distinct regions in the star - forming ring .",
    "one is in the region of the ring that corresponds to blue plume 1 ( the patch on the inner edge of the visible ring , at about 2 oclock , in the @xmath3 image shown in fig .  1 ) , while the other two are in the region corresponding to blue plume 2 ( the patches at about 5 and 10 oclock in the @xmath3 image ) .",
    "the color - color plot , shown in figure 6 , reveals that the ring has a foreground - corrected @xmath33 .",
    "the different symbols indicate which patch the pixels come from , with the red crosses corresponding to the pixels from the inner part of the ring ( the patch at about 2 oclock , in the @xmath3 image ) , and the green triangles and circles corresponding to the pixels from the outer part of the ring ( respectively , the patches at about 5 and 10 oclock in the @xmath3 image ) .",
    "the crosses are systematically redder in @xmath34 than the circles and triangles , as would be expected given that they come from the redder plume .",
    "the arrow in the upper right corner of fig .",
    "6 is a reddening vector for one magnitude of absorption in @xmath22 , using the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law .",
    "the thin line shows the model color vector of a mixture of young and old populations discussed in  5.3 , below .",
    "there is evidence for a trend with @xmath1 color such that the bluest pixels in @xmath1 are the reddest pixels in @xmath5 ( that is , in the opposite sense to the model color vector ) .",
    "majewski ( 1988 ) saw a similar trend in his optical and nir data for the starburst ring galaxy 52w036 .",
    "he noted that the bluest pixels in @xmath35 were the reddest pixels in @xmath36 . for our data ,",
    "the spearman and kendall rank correlation tests both indicate that this trend is significant at greater than the 99.9% level for the full sample ( 83 data points ) . if we restrict the test to just the pixels from blue plume 2 ( 56 points ) , the result holds with even higher significance .",
    "the trend breaks down when we consider only the pixels from blue plume 1 ( 27 points ) .",
    "this may be due to the small number of pixels detected in blue plume 1 , or it may be that the trend is an astrophysical one that is driven by the young stellar population . in this case , the trend could disappear for blue plume 1 due to increased dilution from the old stellar population .",
    "while we do not feel our data warrant a detailed investigation of this point , two possible causes for the observed trend are contamination of the @xmath2 fluxes by the emission lines of [ ] from regions ( e.g. , garnett 1989 ; castellanos , daz & terlevich 2002 ) and the presence of a significant number of late - type supergiants in the most actively star - forming regions ( e.g. , schaller et al .  1992 ; rhoads 1998 ) .",
    "both of these will lead to enhanced red emission in the regions of the youngest stellar populations .",
    "majewski ( 1988 ) suggested that his result was due to the presence of late - type supergiants as well .",
    "this interpretation is bolstered by a consideration of the integrated colors of star clusters in the magellanic clouds from the study of persson et al .",
    "a plot of @xmath35 against @xmath36 shows a u - shaped distribution of points , with the reddest clusters in @xmath36 having either the reddest @xmath35 colors ( for the oldest clusters ) or the bluest @xmath35 colors ( for the youngest clusters ) .",
    "the @xmath37-band also contains the br@xmath38 ( 2.16@xmath11 m ) emission line , which could also lead to ( or enhance ) the observed trends .",
    "the technique of using pcmds to study the structure and stellar populations of galaxies is not common , but we are not the first to use it . bothun ( 1986 ) presented an analysis of a @xmath6@xmath39 pcmd of ngc 4449 .",
    "his data show a similar blue plume structure to that which we find for ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 .",
    "there is little evidence for a red plume in bothun s data , but ngc 4449 is a much later - type galaxy than our targets , and thus has a relatively more dominant young population .",
    "also , bothun s data are in the @xmath6- and @xmath40-bands , which do not provide as clean a spectral discriminant between hot and cool stars as do our @xmath0- and @xmath2-band data .",
    "bothun ( 1986 ) found a spatial segregation in color , analogous to what we see in our data ( see his fig .",
    "8) , but in the opposite sense : the bluest pixels in ngc 4449 are along the central star - forming ridge ( see the image in sandage & bedke 1994 ) , with increasingly red pixels at larger radii .",
    "this difference again follows from the much later hubble type of ngc 4449 compared to our targets : ngc 4449 is an irregular , with a central band of vigorous star formation .",
    "our earlier - type spirals both have central bulges , with no significant current central star formation .",
    "as noted in  4 , above , majewski ( 1988 ) presented a @xmath35@xmath36 pixel color - color map of the starbursting ring galaxy associated with the radio source 52w036 , and noted that the reddest pixels in @xmath36 were the bluest pixels in @xmath35 .",
    "he also noted the general trend of increasingly blue color ( for the @xmath35 color , in his case ) with increasing radius .",
    "he ascribed this to a radial age gradient in the starbursting ring .",
    "the use of pcmds was also discussed by kron , annis & wilhite ( 2000 ) .",
    "they present @xmath41@xmath42 pcmds for a spiral ( ngc 4030 ) and an elliptical ( ngc 4753 ) . despite the smaller color baseline and poorer spatial resolution of their data , they find structures similar to what we see in our data .",
    "they also note that pixels from a given blue plume in ngc 4030 all come from the same annulus .",
    "thus they see the same spatial correlation between location and color that we do , and reach the same basic conclusions about its origin .",
    "one measure of the importance of ongoing star formation in a disk is an estimate of how much of the disk is currently populated by young stars .",
    "the fraction of pixels in the inner ring of ngc 6753 ( the red zone in fig .",
    "3 ) that are above a minimum threshold of 3 dn in the @xmath0 is about 60% .",
    "for the nuclear ring of ngc 6782 ( the red and green zones in fig .",
    "4 ) the fraction of pixels above this threshold is about 50% . if we extrapolate the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 surface brightness for the red plumes from fig .  5",
    ", we can estimate that the underlying old populations in these regions will have @xmath43 .",
    "this works out to less than 1 dn in the @xmath0 .",
    "thus a threshold of 3 dn selects pixels in which the @xmath0 is dominated by the unobscured young population .",
    "this implies that at least 50 - 60% of the disk surface area is engaged in on - going star formation in the most actively star - forming radial zones in our targets .",
    "this is really a lower limit , as it ignores the ( obviously present ) effects of extinction .",
    "a more traditional way of examining the properties of galaxy disks is the use of radial surface - brightness and color profiles . in figure 7",
    "we show @xmath0 ( circles ) and @xmath2-band ( crosses ) surface - brightness profiles , and @xmath1 color profiles for ngc 6753 .",
    "the profiles were generated using elliptical annuli , with the ( assumed constant ) ellipticities measured from the f814w image at a radius of about 50@xmath44 from the nucleus .",
    "ngc 6753 shows a peak in @xmath2 surface brightness , and then a general decline with radius .",
    "there are changes in slope in the surface - brightness profile at about 10@xmath44 and at about 18@xmath44 .",
    "the rate of decline of the @xmath2 surface brightness increases at just beyond these radii .",
    "the @xmath0 surface brightness profile shows strong enhancements at radii just inside the slope changes of the @xmath2 surface brightness profile .",
    "these show up as strong blueward peaks in the color profile , and correspond to the two blue plumes in the pcmd .",
    "the feature at @xmath1010@xmath44 corresponds to the red points in fig .  3 , and the feature at @xmath1018@xmath44 is the strong spiral arms plotted in green in fig .  3 .",
    "figure 8 shows the same plots for ngc 6782 .",
    "the @xmath2 ( crosses ) surface - brightness profile of ngc 6782 shows less structure than that of ngc 6753 .",
    "there is one clear break at about 20@xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath0 ( circles ) surface - brightness profile has a much stronger enhancement at this radius , and the color profile has a strong blue feature here .",
    "the @xmath0 surface - brightness profile also has a strong enhancement at about 5@xmath44 , that shows up as a dramatic blue spike in the color profile .",
    "these are due to the two rings of star formation , with the feature at @xmath105@xmath44 plotted in fig .",
    "4 as red and green points , and the feature at @xmath1020@xmath44 plotted in fig .  4 as blue points .",
    "the behavior of the radial profiles of both galaxies supports the conclusion that we drew from fig .",
    "5 : regions of strong , unobscured , on - going star formation ( as traced by localized enhancements in the @xmath0 surface brightness ) are associated with regions of increased rate of decline in the @xmath2-band surface brightness .",
    "it is these discontinuities in the @xmath2-band surface brightness that drive the separations between the plumes we see in the pcmds .",
    "the power of a pixel analysis is that it demonstrates that the range of @xmath0 surface brightness is the same in each region of strong star formation ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "that is , the maximum rate of localized star formation is not a strong function of the underlying distribution of old stellar mass .",
    "this point is lost in a traditional profile analysis .",
    "our pcmds are noisy .",
    "in particular , they suffer from obvious discreteness noise due to the low count rate in the nuv data . binning the data",
    "makes the trade off of lowering the spatial resolution while allowing us to probe fainter surface brightness levels at a given signal to noise .",
    "we made 2@xmath452 and 3@xmath453 binned images of both galaxies , and generated pcmds from the binned images .",
    "we imposed a limit of @xmath46 per pixel on the binned pcmds . for ngc 6753",
    "this translates to a minimum of 4 dn per 2@xmath452 binned pixel and 6 dn per 3@xmath453 binned pixel .",
    "this means that the 2@xmath452 binned image probes roughly 1.2 magnitudes fainter in surface brightness than does the unbinned image , while the 3@xmath453 binned image goes roughly 1.6 magnitudes fainter .",
    "for ngc 6782 the limits are 3 dn per 2@xmath452 binned pixel and 5 dn per 3@xmath453 binned pixel .",
    "this means that the 2@xmath452 binned image probes roughly 1.5 magnitudes fainter in surface brightness than does the unbinned image , while the 3@xmath453 binned image goes roughly 1.8 magnitudes fainter .",
    "we present the binned pcmds in figure 9 . as in fig .  2 , interior to the left - hand axis , we plot the surface brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond .",
    "9a , b show the 2@xmath452 and 3@xmath453 binned binned pcmds for ngc 6753 , respectively , while fig .",
    "9c , d show the the 2@xmath452 and 3@xmath453 binned binned pcmds for ngc 6782 .",
    "ngc 6753 now shows evidence for at least four blue plumes .",
    "the improvement in the pcmd for ngc 6782 is less dramatic , but the blue plumes are better defined , and extend to much fainter surface brightness than in the unbinned data .",
    "the binned pcmds for ngc 6753 ( fig .",
    "9a , b ) show the same basic features at high surface brightness as does the unbinned pcmd .",
    "the blue plumes are a bit more diffuse . at lower surface brightness ,",
    "some interesting features emerge .",
    "the red plume has a clear faint limit ( at @xmath47 in fig .",
    "9b ) , much brighter than the snr cut - off imposed .",
    "this limit is the minimum nuv surface brightness of the old population in the bulge region of ngc 6753 .",
    "there is also a faint limit to the inner blue plume that reflects the minimum nuv surface brightness of the inner ring , at @xmath48 in fig .  9b . given our assumed distance ( see table 1 ) ,",
    "this is roughly the expected apparent magnitude of a single o5 main sequence star .",
    "the distribution of pixels blueward of the blue plume 2 in fig .",
    "2a ( the blue region in fig .",
    "4 ) is a coherent plume in fig .",
    "these pixels are due to the outer star - forming regions in the disk .    the binned pcmds for ngc 6782 ( fig .",
    "9c , d ) show the truncation of the red plume , similar to what is seen in ngc 6753 .",
    "they also reveal the benefit of high angular resolution : the two distinct blue plumes in fig .",
    "2b are merged together in the binned pcmds .",
    "however , the star forming knots associated with the inner ring ( not the nuclear ring ! ) form a well - developed blue plume in the fig .  9c , running from ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) to ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "only the very brightest knots associated with this plume show up in the unbinned pcmd .",
    "the @xmath0 light traces the distribution of on - going unobscured star formation in our targets . in both galaxies",
    ", the majority of the on - going star formation occurs in small radial ranges .",
    "that is , the current star forming properties of the disks are governed by the gravitational dynamics of the disks .",
    "both ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 are in the catalog of southern ringed galaxies ( buta 1995 ) , in which they are classified as ( r@xmath53)sa(r)b ( ngc 6753 ) and ( r@xmath54)sb(r)0/a ( ngc 6782 ) .",
    "thus there is significant prior work on the internal dynamical state of both systems .    in both galaxies",
    ", there is no evidence for current star formation in the inner parts of the galaxies ( the red plumes ) .",
    "buta & crocker ( 1993 ) have argued that the onset of strong star formation in ngc 6753 ( that is , the inner boundary of the region that is responsible for blue plume 1 ) occurs at the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "the inner ring in ngc 6753 is the structure that marks the spatial boundary between the pixels forming the two blue plumes .",
    "crocker , baugus & buta ( 1996 ) identify this as the location of the 4 to 1 ultraharmonic resonance ( uhr ) . at this point ,",
    "the long - term star formation rate drops abruptly , and blue plume 2 shows pixels of ongoing star formation in the disk outside the uhr .",
    "the very blue pixels show the knots of current star formation in the outer ring , which is most likely associated with the co - rotation radius ( cr ) .    the bright star - forming ring that is so prominent in our @xmath0 image of ngc 6782 is not the inner ring , but is actually a third , nuclear ring .",
    "byrd et al .  (",
    "1994 ) associate the nuclear ring with the ilr .",
    "the blue plumes correspond to the inside and outside of the dust lane associated with this nuclear ring that surrounds the nuclear bar .",
    "the @xmath2-band surface brightness drops abruptly at the radius of the dust lane , and outside this region current star formation ceases entirely .",
    "the outer blue plume is due to a small number of star forming knots in the inner ring that is associated with the terminus of the inner bar .",
    "the bar is visible in our @xmath2 image , and is prominent in ground - based nir images ( eskridge et al .",
    "byrd et al .  ( 1994 ) associate the inner ring with the uhr .",
    "our data show evidence for dynamically triggered on - going star formation added on to the accumulated older stellar populations of the target galaxies . in order to put this interpretation on a firmer footing , we compare our data to model properties of single stars , and composite stellar populations , and to observations of young stellar clusters .",
    "romaniello et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have published model stellar color - temperature data for a number of hst / wfpc2 bandpasses .",
    "figure 10 shows the predicted relationship between effective temperature and our @xmath34 color for both main - sequence ( @xmath55 ) and giant ( @xmath56 ) stars .",
    "the reddest colors observed in our pcmds for both ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 are @xmath57 .",
    "the models of romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that such a color is appropriate for stars with @xmath58 k ; early kv or late giii stars .",
    "the turn - off of an old stellar population dominates its uv light , and an early k turn - off is appropriate for the stellar population that dominates the centers of early- to mid - type spirals .",
    "as this is exactly where the red - plume pixels are located , this argues strongly that the red plumes are due to the old stellar population .",
    "the bluest colors predicted in the romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models are @xmath59 , for o stars ( @xmath60 k ) .",
    "the bluest pixels in our pcmd for ngc 6753 are also @xmath61 , supporting our argument that the light from these pixels is dominated by unobscured on - going massive star formation .",
    "the bluest pixels in the pcmd for ngc 6782 are only @xmath62 . if the light from these pixels is dominated by current / recent star formation , that implies the maximum stellar temperature in ngc 6782 is only @xmath63 k , corresponding to late b stars .",
    "an alternative explanation is that even the bluest pixels in ngc 6782 have a substantial contribution to their light from the older , redder stellar population .",
    "if we assume that the bluest pixels in ngc 6782 have all their nuv light coming from o stars , the absolute magnitudes of those pixels ( @xmath26 ) require about 20 - 25 o5 stars per pixel .",
    "the colors of the pixels are @xmath62 , so @xmath64 .",
    "the romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models indicate that these stars would have an integrated @xmath2-band absolute magnitude of @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the total contribution of the underlying old population would need to be @xmath66 . assuming this light to be produced by k5iii stars leads to the requirement of about 5000 such stars per pixel .",
    "the predicted integrated @xmath0 absolute magnitude of 5000 k5iii stars is only @xmath67 ; a negligible contribution to the total @xmath26 .",
    "thus the o stars account for all the @xmath0 light , and the k stars dominate the @xmath2-band light .",
    "we can approach the problem from a different direction using the spectral evolution models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the question we wish to probe is how mixing various amounts of a young stellar population with an underlying old population will effect the predicted @xmath1 color of the resulting composite stellar population .",
    "we adopt the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) 10 gyr model , with a low - mass cut - off of 0.1 @xmath68 as our old model , and the 1 myr model , with a low - mass cut - off of 0.1 @xmath68 and high - mass cut - off of 125 @xmath68 as our young model .",
    "we combine these models with variable weights , and convolve the combinations with the sensitivity curves for our filters , using _",
    "synphot_. we picked a constant @xmath2-band magnitude , and determined the predicted @xmath1 color for a range of weights .",
    "as we constrain the @xmath2-band magnitude , the weights reflect the input contributions of the young and old populations to the desired @xmath2-band magnitude .",
    "the results of this experiment are given in table 5 , and shown in figure 11 .",
    "figure 11a shows the data for ngc 6753 .",
    "the dotted line is the vector resulting from combining a range of weights of young and old populations with the constraint that @xmath69 ( roughly the magnitude of the base of blue plume 1 ) .",
    "the circles show the knot points , with a pure young population at the top , and an order of magnitude decrease in the weight of the young population for each circle . the circle at ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) results from a young population that contributes only @xmath72 of the @xmath2 light .",
    "figure 11b shows the same models overlayed on the ngc 6782 pcmd , with the constraint shifted to @xmath73 .",
    "the knot point at ( @xmath70 , @xmath74 ) results from a young population that contributes only @xmath72 of the @xmath2 light .",
    "the model runs nearly parallel to the blue plumes in ngc 6753 . the model and",
    "the data are a bit more skewed for ngc 6782 , but in both cases the loci defined by these simple models are good representations of the distributions of the points in the blue plumes of the pcmds",
    ". thus one can produce the observed distribution of points in the pcmds by either simple mixtures of young and old populations , or by pure young populations and reddening ( although the existence of an old population follows from the @xmath2-band morphologies ) .",
    "note that this also means , at least in the case of ngc 6753 , that the separation between the plumes is not due to variations in the current level of star formation laid atop a constant old population .",
    "this will move a given point along a plume , but will not move it from one plume to another .    in fig .",
    "6 , we show the locus of the mixture model , as a solid line , in the @xmath5@xmath1 color - color plane .",
    "the two large squares show the predicted colors for young population fractions of @xmath72 and @xmath75 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "the points generally scatter around the model , and indicate that a small fraction of on - going star formation plus substantial and variable reddening can produce the colors we see .",
    "we note that the generally redder colors of the pixels from the inner part of the nuclear ring can easily be due to either reddening or to a larger contribution from the old stellar population .",
    "a final test of our basic picture is provided by the data of harris et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who provide f300w and f814w observations of young star clusters in m83 .",
    "they estimate the ages of these clusters to be in the range 250 myr . in figure 12",
    ", we show the @xmath1 colors of the m83 starclusters plotted against their ages .",
    "the youngest m83 clusters are generally the bluest , and have typical integrated colors of @xmath76 , consistent with the bluest plumes in ngc 6753 .",
    "the oldest clusters have colors of @xmath77 , more similar to the bluest plumes we see in ngc 6782 .",
    "these tests show that the redder colors of the blue plumes in ngc 6782 , compared to ngc 6753 , can be due to either an older starburst population , or a larger fraction of old stars mixed with a zero - age starburst population .",
    "we believe the latter interpretation is more likely correct , as the active star formation in ngc 6782 occurs in the very inner part of the galaxy , and ngc 6782 is an earlier - type system than ngc 6753 .",
    "we have analysed hst / wfpc2 @xmath0 and @xmath2 images of the face - on spiral galaxies ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 .",
    "we use these images to construct @xmath0@xmath8 pcmds for these galaxies .",
    "our data are a set of aligned hst / wfpc2 images , with the images for a given galaxy all obtained in the same orbit .",
    "thus we have sets of well - aligned , undersampled images .",
    "this is a real advantage for pixel - mapping , as it results in essentially statistically independent pixels .",
    "one can thus treat each pixel as a pseudo - star cluster .",
    "this work opens the possibility of studying the detailed interplay between the star - formation history and dynamics of nearby disk galaxies . as the @xmath2-band light is mainly from the old population , it is a good tracer of the stellar mass .",
    "the @xmath78-band mass to light ratio is between 1 and 2 in solar units , and is not a strong function of age for populations older than 1 gyr or so .",
    "so the @xmath34 color is , in effect , a measure of the current unobscured star formation rate per unit stellar mass .",
    "our pcmds reveal clear , separated plumes of pixels .",
    "each of these plumes have strongly varying @xmath0 surface brightness , and nearly constant @xmath2 surface brightness .",
    "the maximum and average @xmath0 surface brightness is the same from plume to plume .",
    "it is the decline with increasing radius of the maximum @xmath2 surface brightness that causes the separation between the plumes . in both galaxies ,",
    "the plumes correspond to distinct , sharply bounded radial ranges , with the @xmath1 color at a given @xmath0 surface brightness being bluer at larger radii .",
    "these plumes are parallel to both the reddening vector , and simple models of mixtures of young and old populations .",
    "thus it is unclear from our data if the distribution of points in a given plume is primarily due to variations in reddening or in the relative importance of a young stellar population .",
    "conversely , it is clear that neither reddening , nor varying the importance of a young population can produce the separations between the plumes .",
    "the @xmath2 images , as well as radial surface - brightness and color plots indicate that the separate plumes are caused by discontinuities in the surface density of the old stellar population .",
    "these discontinuities are the result of the accumulated history of star formation in the disks of these galaxies . the current star formation , as traced by the @xmath0 images is clearly driven by dynamical triggers in both galaxies .",
    "ngc 6782 is a particularly clear example of this since all the current star formation , as traced by the @xmath0 light , is associated with the nuclear and inner rings .",
    "we have an @xmath3 image of ngc 6782 that shows emission from the nuclear ring .",
    "we have used this to generate an @xmath5@xmath1 pixel color - color diagram .",
    "the colors are generally consistent with a model that mixes a small fraction of a young stellar population with a dominant old population",
    ". either variations in the relative strength of on - going star formation or reddening can produce the scatter we see in the color - color plot .",
    "a curious feature of this diagram is that the bluest pixels in @xmath5 tend to be the reddest pixels in @xmath1 .",
    "this trend is statistically significant based on both the spearman and kendall rank tests .",
    "we speculate that it may be due to a combination of enhanced [ ] emission from regions and the red flux from late - type supergiants associated with very young stellar populations .",
    "the sort of study we have done in this paper is now possible for a substantial number of galaxies as the result of our cycle 9 ( windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) and 10 hst uv imaging programs .",
    "a more densely sampled spectral energy distribution would allow for more detailed stellar population modelling than the admittedly crude attempt we have made here ( e.g. , frogel 1985 ) .",
    "we are encouraged that the hubble heritage team followed up our imaging of ngc 6782 with a multi - band heritage imaging program .",
    "the addition of just the remaining optical bandpasses ( @xmath79 ) will allow a much more accurate disentangling of the various effects of age , extinction , metallicity , and the relative importance of different populations than has been possible here .",
    "one clear task for the future is to use the heritage data to investigate the stellar populations and effects of dust in the disk of ngc 6782 .    a more ambitious program for the future would be to observe these galaxies with the nicmos or wfc3 on hst in order to obtain nir colors and 2.29 @xmath11 m co index images .",
    "broad - band nir imaging would provide data on the distribution of the old stellar populations that are essentially free from the effects of dust .",
    "the nir co index is an excellent diagnostic for the relative importance of late - type supergiants in an unresolved stellar population , due to its strong dependence on surface gravity ( baldwin , frogel & persson 1973 ) .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies ( rhoads 1998 ) have shown that co index measurements are a potentially powerful tool for studying the distribution of recent star formation in galaxies , as they are sensitive to the distribution of massive supergiants , and are relatively unaffected by dust .",

    "<S> ultraviolet and optical images of the face - on spiral galaxies ngc 6753 and ngc 6782 reveal regions of strong on - going star formation that are associated with structures traced by the old stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we use these images to construct @xmath0@xmath1 pixel color - magnitude diagrams ( pcmds ) that reveal plumes of pixels with strongly varying @xmath0 surface brightness and nearly constant @xmath2 surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the plumes correspond to sharply bounded radial ranges , with @xmath1 at a given @xmath0 surface brightness being bluer at larger radii . </S>",
    "<S> the plumes are parallel to both the reddening vector and simple model mixtures of young and old populations , thus neither reddening nor the fraction of the young population can produce the observed separation between the plumes . </S>",
    "<S> the images , and radial surface - brightness and color plots indicate that the separate plumes are caused by sharp declines in the surface densities of the old populations at radii corresponding to disk resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum surface brightness of the @xmath0 light remains essentially constant with radius , while the maximum @xmath2 surface brightness declines sharply with radius . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath3 image of ngc 6782 shows emission from the nuclear ring . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of points in an @xmath4@xmath1 pixel color - color diagram is broadly consistent with the simple mixture model , but shows a residual trend that the bluest pixels in @xmath5 are the reddest pixels in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to a combination of red continuum from late - type supergiants and [ ] emission lines associated with regions in active star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that pixel mapping is a powerful tool for studying the distribution and strength of on - going star formation in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> deep , multi - color imaging can extend this to studies of extinction , and the ages and metallicities of composite stellar populations in nearby galaxies . </S>"
