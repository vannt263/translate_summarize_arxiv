    "the study of nuclei around double shell closures plays a key role in testing the predictive power of the shell model . in this context , of special interest are nuclei in the close vicinity to @xmath5pb , @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn , which may be assumed to be good closed cores .",
    "experimentally , a large body of data is available in the @xmath5pb region , whereas it is a very hard task to obtain information on @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn neighbors . in recent years",
    ", however , substantial progress has been made to access the regions of shell closures off stability , which has paved the way to spectroscopic studies of nuclei in the neighborhood of both @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn .",
    "these data offer the opportunity for testing the basic ingredients of shell - model calculations , especially the matrix elements of the effective interaction , well away from the valley of stability .",
    "this may support confidence in the predictions of calculations , which may , in turn , stimulate efforts to gain more experimental information on these nuclei .    during the last few years ,",
    "we have studied [ 1,2 ] several nuclei around @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn within the framework of the shell model employing realistic effective interactions derived from modern nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) potentials . in these studies",
    "we have been mainly concerned with nuclei having few identical particles or holes .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to report on some results of our current work in these regions , which we have obtained starting from the cd - bonn free @xmath6 potential @xcite . in particular",
    ", we shall consider the four odd - odd nuclei @xmath0sb , @xmath2sb , @xmath3 in and @xmath4ag .",
    "the motivation for this choice lies in the fact that these nuclei are a source of information on the effective neutron - proton interaction in the @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn regions .",
    "more precisely , we focus attention on proton - neutron hole and neutron - proton hole multiplets in the former and latter region , respectively .    to place this work in its proper perspectives ,",
    "a brief historical digression is in order .",
    "more than thirty years ago the study of particle - hole multiplets in the @xmath5pb region was the subject of great experimental and theoretical interest [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of @xmath5bi was extensively studied through pick - up and stripping reactions and several proton - neutron hole multiplets were identified [ 4,5 ] .",
    "it turned out that a main feature of all multiplets with more than two members is that the states with minimum and maximum @xmath7 have the highest excitation energy , while the state with next to the highest @xmath7 is the lowest one .",
    "on the theoretical side , a very good agreement with experiment was obtained in the shell - model study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where particle - hole matrix elements deduced from the hamada - johnston @xmath6 potential @xcite were employed .",
    "despite these early achievements , little work along these lines has been done ever since . by considering the new data which are becoming available in the @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn regions and the prospect of spectroscopic studies of unstable nuclei opened up by the development of radioactive ion beams",
    ", we feel that the time is ripe to revive theoretical interest in this subject and perform shell - model calculations making use of a modern @xmath6 potential and improved many - body methods for deriving the effective interaction .    in sec .",
    "2 we give an outline of the theoretical framework in which our realistic shell - model calculations have been performed . in sec .",
    "3 we present several calculated particle - hole multiplets and show that all the available experimental data are well reproduced by our calculations .",
    "4 presents some conclusions of our study .",
    "in our calculations for the sb isotopes we assume that @xmath0sn is a closed core and let the valence proton and neutron holes occupy the five single - particle levels @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 of the 50 - 82 shell .",
    "similarly , for @xmath3 in and @xmath4ag we assume these orbits are occupied by the valence neutrons outside the @xmath1sn core while for the proton holes the model space includes the four orbits @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 of the 28 - 50 shell . for the sb isotopes the single - proton and single neutron - hole energies",
    "have been taken from the experimental spectra [ 9 - 11 ] of @xmath17sb and @xmath18sn , respectively .",
    "the only exception is the proton @xmath19 which was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , since the corresponding single - particle level is still missing in @xmath17sb . for @xmath3 in and @xmath4ag the single - particle and single - hole energies can not be taken from experiment , since no spectroscopic data are yet available for @xmath20sn and @xmath21 in .",
    "therefore , we have taken them from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively , where they were determined by an analysis of the low - energy spectra of the sn isotopes with @xmath22 and of the @xmath23 isotones with @xmath24 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , in our shell - model calculations we have made use of a realistic effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn free nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "this high - quality @xmath6 potential , which is based upon meson exchange , fits very accurately ( @xmath25/datum @xmath26 ) the world @xmath6 data below 350 mev available in the year 2000 .",
    "the shell - model effective interaction @xmath27 is defined , as usual , in the following way . in principle",
    ", one should solve a nuclear many - body schrdinger equation of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the kinetic energy .",
    "this full - space many - body problem is reduced to a smaller model - space problem of the form @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath33 being an auxiliary potential introduced to define a convenient single - particle basis , and @xmath34 denotes the projection operator onto the chosen model space .",
    "a main difficulty encountered in the derivation of @xmath27 from a modern @xmath6 potential , such as cd - bonn , is the existence of a strong repulsive core which prevents its direct use in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this difficulty is usually overcome by resorting to the well known brueckner @xmath35-matrix method . here ,",
    "we have made use of a new approach @xcite which has proved to be an advantageous alternative [ 15,16 ] to the use of the above method .",
    "the basic idea underlying this approach is to construct a low - momentum @xmath6 potential , @xmath36 , that preserves the physics of the original potential @xmath37 up to a certain cut - off momentum @xmath38 . in particular ,",
    "the scattering phase shifts and deuteron binding energy calculated by @xmath37 are reproduced by @xmath36 .",
    "the latter is a smooth potential that can be used directly as input for the calculation of shell - model effective interactions .",
    "a detailed description of our derivation of @xmath36 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a criterion for the choice of the cut - off parameter @xmath38 is also given .",
    "we have used here the value @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "once the @xmath36 is obtained , the calculation of the matrix elements of the particle - particle and hole - hole interaction is carried out within the framework of a folded - diagram method , as described , for instance , in refs .",
    "[ 14,17 ] .",
    "it should be pointed out that the effective interaction in the proton - neutron channel has been explicitly derived in the particle - hole formalism .",
    "a description of the derivation of the particle - hole effective interaction is given in ref .",
    "we report here some selected results of our study of nuclei in the regions of shell closures off stability .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the oxbash shell - model code @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the sb isotopes .",
    "the most appropriate system to study the proton - neutron interaction is @xmath0sb which , having one proton valence particle and one neutron valence hole , plays in the @xmath0sn region the role played by @xmath5bi in the pb region .",
    "experimental information on this nucleus is provided by the studies of refs .",
    "[ 19 - 21 ] .",
    "two @xmath41-decaying isomers with @xmath42 and @xmath43 are known , which originate from the @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath44 @xmath46 configurations , respectively .",
    "while the relative energy of these two states has not been determined , there are indications that the @xmath43 state is located about 200 kev above the @xmath47 ground state @xcite .    as regards the positive - parity states , besides the other three members of the @xmath44 @xmath45 multiplet , some states originating from the @xmath44 @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath45 , and @xmath44 @xmath50 configurations have been identified .",
    "for the negative - parity states , very little experimental information is presently available . in a very recent study @xcite , several new transitions feeding the @xmath43 isomer have been revealed . in particular , a @xmath51 state at 1.025 mev",
    "has been identified which may be attributed to the @xmath44 @xmath46 configuration .",
    "this makes very interesting the study of @xmath2sb , for which five low - lying states with @xmath52 and @xmath51 have been identified [ 22,23 ] and interpreted as members of the same multiplet .",
    "several calculated multiplets for @xmath0sb are reported in fig . 1 and compared with the existing experimental data",
    ". note that in fig .",
    "1(a ) all energies are relative to the @xmath47 state while in fig .",
    "1(b ) they are relative to the @xmath43 state ( our calculations predict that the @xmath43 state lies 226 kev above the @xmath47 ground state ) .    as regards the comparison between theory and experiment , we see that the calculated energies are in good agreement with the observed ones .",
    "in fact , the discrepancies are all in the order of few tens of kev , the only exceptions being the @xmath53 and @xmath51 states of the @xmath49 @xmath45 and @xmath44 @xmath46 multiplets , which come about 300 kev above and 200 kev below their experimental counterparts , respectively .    the calculated @xmath44 @xmath46 multiplet for @xmath2sb is reported and compared with the experimental data in fig .",
    "we see that the agreement between experiment and theory is remarkably good , thus providing further support to our predictions for @xmath0sb .",
    "it should be noted that both the experimental and calculated energies are relative to the @xmath43 state , which has been experimentally observed to be the ground state .",
    "our calculations predict @xcite for the ground state @xmath54 , the @xmath43 state lying at 92 kev excitation energy . as regards the wave functions of the states reported in fig .",
    "2 , we find that they are indeed dominated by the @xmath55 configuration @xmath44 @xmath46 while the remaining two neutron holes give rise to a zero - coupled pair occupying the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 levels .",
    "it is evident from figs . 1 and 2 that a main feature of the calculated multiplets is that the states with minimum and maximum @xmath7 have the highest excitation energy and are well separated from the other states , for which the splitting is relatively small .",
    "this pattern is in agreement with the experimental one for the @xmath44 @xmath45 multiplet in @xmath0sb and the experimental data available for the other multiplets also go in the same direction .",
    "it should be pointed out that this behavior is quite similar to that exhibited [ 6,7 ] by the multiplets in the heavier particle - hole nucleus @xmath5bi . also , it is worth noting that in all of our calculated multiplets the state of spin ( @xmath59 ) is the lowest , in agreement with the early predictions of the brennan - bernstein coupling rule @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the @xmath1sn region . in this region",
    "the counterpart of @xmath5bi and @xmath0sb is @xmath1 in , for which studies of excited states are at present out of reach .",
    "we have therefore considered the two neighboring odd - odd isotopes @xmath3 in and @xmath4ag , focusing attention on the @xmath60 multiplet for which some experimental information is available . in figs . 3 and 4 we report the results of our calculations for @xmath3 in and @xmath4ag , respectively , and compare them with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we see that the agreement between experiment and theory is of the same quality as that obtained in the @xmath0sn region , the largest discrepancy being 130 kev for the @xmath61 state in @xmath4ag .",
    "the pattern of the calculated multiplets turns out to be similar to that of the multiplets in the sb isotopes , but with the states with minimum and maximum @xmath7 less separate from the other ones .",
    "actually , for @xmath3 in we find that the energy of the @xmath62 state is about the same as that of the @xmath63 state . in this connection",
    ", it should be mentioned that for the former state the percentage of configurations other than those having a @xmath64 proton hole and a @xmath65 neutron is about 50% . a detailed discussion of the structure of the calculated states will be included in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have presented here some results of a shell - model study of nuclei in the close vicinity to doubly magic @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn focusing attention on the particle - hole multiplets , which are a direct source of information on the neutron - proton effective interaction . in our calculations",
    "we have employed a realistic effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn @xmath6 potential .",
    "this has been done using a new approach @xcite to shell - model effective interactions instead of the usual brueckner @xmath35-matrix method .",
    "we have shown that our results are in very good agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "it should be stressed that in our calculations no use has been made of any adjustable parameter .",
    "in fact , for the single - neutron and single proton - hole energies in the @xmath1sn region , which are not available from experiment , we have adopted the values determined in our earlier studies [ 13,14 ] on sn isotopes and @xmath23 isotones .    in summary",
    ", we may conclude that the results of the present study of particle - hole multiplets in the @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn regions are consistent with those obtained in our previous studies of nuclei with identical valence particles and holes in the same regions @xcite .",
    "this confirms that realistic shell - model calculations are able to describe with quantitative accuracy the spectroscopic properties of nuclei in regions of shell closures off stability , giving confidence in their predictive power . on the experimental side ,",
    "it is of key importance to gain more information on nuclei in these regions .",
    "this is certainly a main challenge of nuclear structure experiments with radioactive ion beams",
