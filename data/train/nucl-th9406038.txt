    "recently the slac ne18 collaboration @xcite have described a method for analyzing the nuclear transparency ( @xmath1 ) in  interactions and have presented determinations of @xmath1 for various nuclei as a function of momentum transfer .",
    "these experiments were performed to see if , for high momentum transfers , a weakly interacting object is formed , which leaves the nucleus without further interactions .",
    "such an effect , dubbed `` color transparency '' , was predicted fifteen years ago @xcite . as we shall see the data of ref .",
    "@xcite shows no evidence for color transparency .",
    "however , in the experiment the recoil proton momentum is varied from 1.20 to 4.49 gev / c , corresponding to a range of different .",
    "since the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections are not constant in this momentum region it is possible to examine whether the measured values of @xmath1 reflect this variation of the cross section for _ rescattering _ of the proton in nuclei of different @xmath4 . even without the prediction @xcite that the presence of color screening could affect @xmath1 , it has been long appreciated ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that there is no reason for the struck proton to be on - shell immediately after the  collision and that nuclei could probe this effect . the new data , because of the energy dependence of the rescattering cross section , provides a test of this process .",
    "our calculation of @xmath1 , which includes the effects of nuclear correlations , appears to show that the proton has either reached its on - shell cross section extremely rapidly or , if not , is in a state with a cross - section close to the on - shell value , as measured in @xmath3 and @xmath2 interactions @xcite .    the method of extracting @xmath1 ( and even its definition ) , used by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite for the   experiment , differs from that used in the study of the transparency in  reactions ( refs .",
    "we describe in this note how a simple definition of @xmath1 can be introduced in such a way that color transparency effects are separated from nuclear structure effects .",
    "in references @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier version of this work ) we have previously given a way to include ( jastrow - type ) correlation effects in a glauber calculation of transparency in both the   and interactions . in our method",
    "we generate @xmath5-particle distributions in the nucleus which reproduce both the single - nucleon densities and accepted measures of the two - body spatial correlations .",
    "we then make the assumption that each remaining nucleon contributes incoherently to the rescattering of the fast proton .",
    "if we further use a straight - line trajectory for this fast particle , we can use the glauber approximation . here the transmission coefficient , and thus the transparency , is defined as the product of standard glauber factors for each nucleon , weighted with the @xmath6 particle density .",
    "we have thus defined the transparency @xmath1 as the probability that the struck proton escapes without rescattering .",
    "the calculation uses the measured on - shell total @xmath3 and @xmath2 cross sections under the assumption that the high momentum transfer   interaction leaves the proton in a state that is indistinguishable from a free proton .",
    "since we shall assume here that the proton and neutron densities are identical , we use a total cross section equal to @xmath7 where we use the measured @xmath3 and @xmath2 cross sections @xcite .",
    "we have also shown @xcite that the results are close to those obtained using the standard distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) method as applied by benhar _",
    "@xcite , who also include correlations .",
    "1 shows our calculations of @xmath1 compared with the recent data of ref .",
    "( we use a woods - saxon density , with correlations included , in all the calculations . )",
    "the general features of the calculated values of @xmath1 appear in the plot . at the lowest ( @xmath8 , corresponding with @xmath9 ) the cross sections are low and hence @xmath1 should be higher than average , while as the momentum of the proton increases the value of @xmath1 should go through a minimum and then start to rise again slowly , tracking the measured cross sections",
    ". the effects should be largest in the heaviest nuclei . as we can see from the data , the ratio @xmath1(= 1.04)/ @xmath1(= 3.06 ) increases as one goes from carbon to gold .",
    "this is expected from the theory since higher @xmath4 nuclei allow for a larger number of chances of rescattering . in order to fit the data without correlations",
    "it would be necessary to decrease the effective cross section by about @xmath10 , implying that the cross section is not the normal on - shell cross section .",
    "( see table i in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    fig .",
    "2 shows a comparison of the carbon data with several theoretical calculations .",
    "here we have used a calculation using both a woods - saxon density and a density obtained assuming the @xmath11c is a closed shell nucleus with completely filled harmonic oscillator shell - model orbitals @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( with the h.o .",
    "length parameter @xmath14 ) . for both forms",
    "we have calculated the result with and without the nuclear correlations . without introducing the nuclear correlations the predictions appear to fall substantially below the data .",
    "in the previous section we have presented theoretical computations of @xmath1 and compare them with the reported experimental values of @xmath1 in refs .",
    "unfortunately these experimental and theoretical definitions are not exactly the same ( even though it can be argued that the effect should be small compared to the experimental error bars ) . in this section we expatiate on this problem to decide whether our comparisons are indeed valid .",
    "the cross section for quasielastic scattering is usually expressed @xcite in a factorized form useful for any momentum transfer .",
    "that factorization is given by : @xmath15}/z =     t(\\sigma_{\\rm tot } ) \\int s(\\vec k,\\epsilon,\\sigma_{\\rm tot } )   d\\sigma / dt_{[e - p ] } ( k , \\epsilon ) d\\vec k d\\epsilon .",
    "\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the total momentum of the missing nuclear fragments and @xmath17 is the missing energy .",
    "both these quantities are reconstructed from the measurement of the final state momenta of the proton and electron .",
    "@xmath18 is the   cross section while @xmath19 is the cross section for the _ rescattering _ of the struck proton by the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "( @xmath18 is a strong function of the momentum transfer while the rescatterings are low @xmath20 processes . )",
    "@xmath21 } ( k , \\epsilon)$ ] is the   cross section calculated at the on - shell values of @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "( these values can be obtained from previous data on hydrogen but it is more precise to compare the nuclear data with data on hydrogen in the same experiment . )    in the distorted wave impulse approximation , @xcite which takes into account rescattering of the struck proton , the same form is obtained .",
    "@xmath23 is just the ( normalized to unity ) @xcite probability of finding a final state with the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 when the proton plane waves are modified by absorption .",
    "@xmath1 then becomes the probability that the proton will escape without scattering if it has a cross section @xmath19 .    with this factorization",
    ", @xmath1 depends on the property of the nucleus alone , namely , the spatial distribution of its nucleons , but is independent of the function @xmath23 . for the  reaction in hydrogen",
    ", @xmath1 is by definition unity , since there is no nucleon to rescatter from .",
    "it is unfortunate that _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath23 in principle depend on @xmath19 so that extracting @xmath1 must be done carefully .    in this connection",
    "we point out that there is one experimental circumstance where this coupling can be avoided . in a well designed experiment in any geometry which , however , accepts events of essentially all @xmath16 and @xmath17 , one can make use of the fact that the integral of s over all k and @xmath17 is unity .",
    "thus by weighting each event by the reciprocal of @xmath24 , the known   cross section on the free proton , and summing over all the events , one can obtain directly the number of events needed to compute @xmath1 . by dividing this number by",
    "the number of events obtained in an   experiment on hydrogen one obtains the transparency directly .",
    "this is a measurement of @xmath1 _ independent of the need to know the true spectral functions_.    there is another procedure , the one used in the ne18 experiment , to extract another quantity that is not the @xmath1 described above .",
    "that @xmath1 , now denoted @xmath25 , is defined as the measured rate divided by the rate that would be obtained in the same experimental geometry were the cross section calculated on the basis of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) . in that approximation",
    "the rate is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) with @xmath26 , _ but _ with @xmath23 replaced by the pwia spectral function which we will denote as @xmath27 .",
    "thus the @xmath1 extracted in this experiment is not a direct measurement but is a mixture of experiment and theory .    for the purposes of this paper we need to determine how different the two definitions are .",
    "clearly @xmath28 } ( \\vec k , \\epsilon ) d\\vec k d\\epsilon   } \\over { \\int p(k,\\epsilon , )   d\\sigma / dt_{[e - p ] } ( k , \\epsilon ) d\\vec k d\\epsilon   } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus we have used the dwia and pwia calculations in carbon@xcite , using closure to sum over all missing energy , to see whether the differences are large .",
    "we used the @xmath29 shell - model wavefunction mentioned above , and found only small difference between the shape of the spectral functions in the two cases ( actually , for dwia the longitudinal and transverse spectral functions are different , but even this difference is not very big ) .",
    "this is similar to the results by k. nakamura _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in a study of distortion effects in the low - energy  reaction .    for a heavy nucleus",
    "we expect larger differences because of the larger absorption and also between the orbits having most weight in the interior of the nucleus and those concentrated on the surface .",
    "until this is established one may have to be cautious about replacing the spectral function with a pwia prediction in heavy nuclei .",
    "calculations of the nuclear transparency , taking into account nuclear spatial correlations , agree with the measured data . they appear to verify that in an  reaction in nuclei the recoiling struck proton has a @xmath3 and @xmath2 cross section indistinguishable from a proton in its asymptotic on - shell final state , i.e. , as measured in @xmath30 and @xmath3 measurements .",
    "we point out how it is possible with a properly designed experiment to make a spectral function independent determination of @xmath1 .",
