    "lorentz symmetry is one of the cornerstones of modern physics , and it stands as one of the basic foundations of general relativity ( gr ) and the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . both lorentz covariance to gr and the cpt theorem to the sm involve deeply the lorentz symmetry .",
    "this symmetry has been tested within the energy range currently available , with no violation detected @xcite .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether the lorentz invariance holds exactly or to what extent it holds .",
    "motivated by the unknown underlying theory of quantum gravity @xcite , the possible lorentz symmetry violation effects have been investigated from various theories , for example , noncommutative field theories @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , string theory @xcite , brane - worlds scenarios @xcite , condensed matter analogues of `` emergent gravity '' @xcite , among others lorentz violating scenarios @xcite .    the standard model extension ( sme ) initiated by kosteleck and colladay @xcite is an effective field theory that considers the standard model and general relativity plus all possible lorentz - violating ( lv ) coefficients ( generated as vacuum expectation values of some basic fields belonging to a more fundamental theory , such as string theory @xcite ) that yield lorentz scalars ( as tensor contractions with the standard fields ) under observer lorentz transformations . one strong motivation to study the sme is because lorentz violation is a promising candidate signal for planck - scale physics , and its detection could shed light on the possible route to quantum gravity .",
    "nowadays , lorentz violation has not been detected in experimental tests , making the sme a current active field of research .",
    "the search for novel effects arising from these lv terms , and an improvement of the bounds for the magnitude of these lv coefficients constitute two of the main lines of study of the sme @xcite .",
    "lorentz violation in the photon sector of the sme has been widely investigated in the literature .",
    "the study of light propagation ( from the cosmic microwave background ) offers an opportunity to test lv effects , such as birefringence and polarization properties .",
    "material media have also been used to test lorentz invariance within the sme framework @xcite .",
    "however , this area remains partially unexplored . in this paper",
    "we provide additional contributions to this subject , and we initiate the study of ponderable media as modeled by the photon sector of the minimal sme . more precisely , we analyze materials which besides its dielectric properties , possess additional optical properties ( polarization and magnetization ) arising from the lv coefficients of the sme .",
    "our primary goal here is to provide additional theoretical predictions regarding the quantum vacuum in this theory , in particular , we concentrate in calculating the casimir effect between two planar lorentz - violating ponderable media .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the casimir effect in lv theories has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , however our analysis is quite different since we deal with ponderable media .    the casimir effect ( ce )",
    "@xcite is one of the most remarkable consequences of the nonzero vacuum energy predicted by quantum field theory which has been confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "the ce can be defined as the stress ( force per unit area ) on bounding surfaces when a quantum field is confined to a finite volume of space .",
    "the boundaries can be material media , interfaces between two phases of the vacuum , or topologies of space . in any case",
    ", the modes of the quantum fields are restricted , giving rise to a measurable force , i.e. the casimir force . for a review see , for example ,",
    "the typical example is of the two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum , placed a few micrometers apart .",
    "the experimental accessibility to micrometer - size physics has motivated the theoretical study of the ce in different scenarios , including the gravitational sector @xcite , condensed matter systems @xcite and chiral metamaterials @xcite . in the problem at hand ,",
    "the remarkably strong experimental tests with material media can offer new ways to impose ( or find ) better bounds to the lv coefficients .    in our casimir system , we consider two lorentz - violating ponderable media as modeled by the photon sector of the sme . in order to compute the casimir energy density , we first derive the fresnel coefficients which characterizes a planar vacuum - medium interface , a result which is absent in the sme literature . with the help of these , next we use the lifshitz formula to compute the casimir energy per unit area between two of these materials .",
    "the usual casimir energy density is corrected by a small term which is linear order in the lv coefficients , yielding to an attractive force ( as usual ) between the bodies .",
    "another solution presented here is the casimir effect between two phases of the electromagnetic vacuum : a finite lorentz - symmetric ( maxwell ) vacuum embedded in the infinite lorentz - violating ( sme ) vacuum . in this case , the correction to the casimir energy is second order in the lv coefficients , and we demonstrate that the sign of the slope of the casimir energy depends upon the relation between the magnitudes of the lv coefficients , thus implying that the casimir force could be attractive or repulsive .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ smereview ]",
    "we briefly review the basics of the photon sector of the sme and we establish the model that we are going to deal with . using the corresponding modified constitutive relations and imposing the boundary conditions at the vacuum - medium interface , in section [ fresnelcoefsec ] we calculate the fresnel coefficients . in section [ casimirsec ]",
    "we use the reflection matrix previously obtained to compute the casimir energy density in two different scenarios : i ) between two phases of the electromagnetic vacuum and ii ) between two semi - infinite ponderable media",
    ". a concluding summary of our results comprises the last section [ summconcl ] . here ,",
    "lorentz - heaviside units are assumed ( @xmath2 ) , the metric signature will be taken as @xmath3 , and we use the conventions , greek indices @xmath4 , latin indices @xmath5 , and the levi - civit symbol @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian of the pure photon sector of the minimal sme is composed by the usual maxwell lagrangian plus the additional terms @xmath7 ( sometimes called the carroll - field - jackiw term @xcite ) and @xmath8 .",
    "the lv tensor coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath1 are cpt - odd and cpt - even , respectively .",
    "both terms have received much attention in the literature , and experimental constraints exist for them .",
    "the cpt - odd term leads to negative contributions to the canonical energy and therefore is a potential source of instability .",
    "thus we set the coefficient to zero , @xmath10 .",
    "this is theoretically consistent with radiative corrections in the sme and is well supported experimentally ( stringent constraints on @xmath9 have been set by studying the polarization of radiation from distant radio galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we will consider only the cpt - even tensor in our subsequent analyses .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 4-current source that couples to the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the electromagnetic field strength , which satisfies the homogeneous equations @xmath15 ensuring the gauge invariance of the action under the @xmath16 gauge transformations @xmath17 .",
    "the dimensionless coefficients @xmath18 introduce lorentz and cpt symmetry breakdown , and they have the symmetries of the riemann tensor and a vanishing double trace , which imply a total of 19 independent components .",
    "the equations of motion arising from the lagrange density ( [ action ] ) are @xmath19 which extend the usual covariant maxwell equations to incorporate lorentz violation .",
    "current conservation can be verified directly by taking the divergence at both sides of eq .",

    "for example , the energy - momentum tensor takes the standard form in terms of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "the general solution to the wave equation in the lorentz - violating vacuum is similar to that of a plane wave propagating in an anisotropic medium .",
    "another parametrization of particular relevance for certain experimental considerations employs the four traceless matrices @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a single coefficient .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is antisymmetric while the remaining matrices are symmetric .",
    "the number of independent coefficients in each matrix @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath44 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the remaining independent coefficient is contained in the scalar @xmath45 .",
    "the above parametrization provides a way to split the coefficients into birefringent and nonbirefringent sectors .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath40 coefficients which lead to birefringence of light have been strongly bounded ( at the level of one part in @xmath46 and one part in @xmath47 respectively ) from spectropolarimetry of cosmological distance sources @xcite .",
    "for this reason , throughout this work we disregard the birefringent sector by considering the limit @xmath48 . under this assumption ,",

    "an immediate physical consequence of these modified constitutive relations is the transmutation of the electromagnetic fields : an electric charge in vacuum can generate both electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this magnetoelectric phenomena is also present in real material media , such as topological insulators ( tis ) and chiral metamaterials . in the former , the electromagnetic response of tis",

    "in the case of chiral metamaterials , the modified constitutive relations have the form @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the condon model for chiral molecular media @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the constitutive relations for these materials are not derivable from eqs .",
    "( [ constitsmeusual ] ) because the coefficients @xmath60 for lorentz violation have the symmetries of the riemann tensor , and therefore its components can not be the same .      the main goal of this work is to initiate the analysis of this lorentz - violating electrodynamics in ponderable media .",

    "some simplifying assumptions are adopted in what follows . for simplicity , we work with isotropic dielectric media with no magnetic properties ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus the dielectric tensor is taken to be of the form @xmath84 . since",
    "our primary interest here is the electromagnetic phenomena in ponderable media , let us consider that lorentz violation is only in the photon sector , and the lorentz force is conventional . given that the vacuum lv coefficients have been stringent constrained by experiments , in our model we assume that they can be neglected as compared with the matter lv coefficients , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "one simple possible way to support this assumption is by considering that the coupling between the material and the sme background has the simple form @xmath86 , such that @xmath87 . in practical terms",

    "although the standard model ( sm ) is phenomenologically successful , the search for a theory beyond the sm is motivated by the fact that it suffers from some theoretical inconsistencies , and from some long - standing unresolved problems .",
    "searching for lorentz violation has attracted much attention since it is a promising candidate signal for planck - scale physics , and its detection could shed light on the possible route to quantum gravity . in this scenario ,",
    "the sm is viewed as a low - energy limit of this more fundamental theory . the standard model extension ( sme )",
    "is an effective field theory that incorporates lorentz - violating ( lv ) coefficients to the standard model and general relativity , which can be tested by experiments .",
    "the sme has been in constant development in recent years and all new alternatives to find better bounds for the lv coefficients are of a great value .",
    "the sme has been the focus of various experimental studies , including ones with photons , electrons , protons , and neutrons .",
    "regarding the photon sector , it has been studied radiative corrections , photon splitting and vacuum erenkov and synchrotron radiation . despite of the experimental efforts , no evidence for lorentz violation has yet been found .",
    "material media have also been used to test lorentz invariance , however , this area remains partially unexplored . in this work",
    "we aim to fill in this gap .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the casimir effect between ponderable media in a lorentz - violating electrodynamics derived from the photon sector of the sme which includes a cpt - even term of the form @xmath0 , where the lorentz - violating background tensor @xmath1 possesses the symmetries of the riemann tensor . in this theory , ponderable",
    "media are described by maxwell equations in matter with modified constitutive relations of the form @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the non - birefringent sector and we assume that the vacuum lv coefficients are small as compared with the matter lv coefficients , in such a way that we set @xmath238 identically to zero . although the last assumption over simplifies the model , it represents the first advances in the field of casimir physics between ponderable media within the sme .",
    "we derived the fresnel coefficients which characterizes the vacuum - medium interface , and using the lifshitz formula , we calculated the leading - order deviation from the classical expression for the casimir energy density between two parallel dielectric bodies .",
    "the deviation of the casimir force in the lorentz - violating theory from its standard quantum electrodynamics value is found to be of linear order in the lv coefficients . using the drude s model for the dielectric function",
    ", we performed a numerical analysis for the casimir energy density as a function of @xmath221 and the lv coefficients .",
    "we also found a variety of intriguing effects , such as a non - trivial kerr effect and the casimir effect between two phases of the electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "we considered a finite bubble of lorentz - symmetric ( usual maxwell ) vacuum embedded in the infinite lorentz - violating ( sme ) vacuum , and we calculated the casimir energy at leading - order , which in this case is quadratic in lv coefficients .",
    "we found that the casimir force can be positive , zero , or negative , depending on the relative strengths between the lv coefficients .    due to the limited precision of the current experimental measurements of the casimir force",
    ", no useful bounds on the lv coefficients can be obtained from our results .",
    "the deviation predicted is of theoretical interest , and would only be useful in setting any significant constraints on the lv coefficients only if the precision of the experimental measurements will increase significantly .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the casimir force between two parallel conducting plates has been studied within the sme @xcite , and the main finding is that the leading - order contribution is quadratic in the lv coefficients , which makes the experimental sensitivity more weaker that the casimir force between ponderable media .",
    "this is a strong motivation to study material media in the sme framework .",
    "finally we comment that our model can be further generalized to more realistic cases , for example , by considering the nonzero background vacuum lv coefficients which are present in the whole space , both inside and outside the material media . furthermore , a model for the lv coefficients of the matter sector is absent in the sme literature , and clearly they would be of relevance in the calculation of the casimir effect .",
    "we hope our study motives further investigations regarding the matter sector of the sme .",
