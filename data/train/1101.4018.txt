    "due in large part to the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the goods - n field ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) has become one of the most well - studied extragalactic fields in the sky with existing observations among the deepest at a broad range of wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; elbaz et al .  in prep ) . in the coming years",
    ", this status as one of the very deepest multiwavelength survey fields will be further cemented by the ongoing and upcoming extremely - deep observations with _ spitzer_/irac and _ hst_/wfc3-ir as part of the spitzer extended deep survey ( seds , pi g.  fazio ) and the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , pis s.  faber & h.  ferguson ) , respectively .",
    "given the large commitment of telescope time from both space- and ground - based facilities devoted to imaging the goods - n field , spectroscopic observations in this field possess a significant legacy value .",
    "for instance , spectroscopic redshifts dramatically improve the constraints inferred from imaging alone , allowing rest - frame quantities to be derived with increased precision .",
    "furthermore , only through spectroscopy can assorted spectral and dynamical properties ( such as the strengths and velocity widths of emission and absorption lines ) be measured .",
    "recognizing the potential legacy value of spectroscopic observations in the goods - n field , the team keck redshift survey ( tkrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) utilized the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck ii telescope to create a publicly - available redshift catalog and uniform spectral database across the entire area imaged with _ hst_/acs by the goods team .",
    "altogether , the tkrs observed nearly @xmath5 sources , yielding secure spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath6 objects and enabling numerous studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an effort to augment the value of the existing tkrs dataset , we present observations of @xmath0 unique sources in the goods - n field ( a @xmath7 increase to the tkrs sample size ) , collected as part of the deep3 galaxy redshift survey ( cooper et al .",
    "2011 , in prep ) and using the same instrument and observation methods as the tkrs .",
    "the deep3 survey is an ongoing spectroscopic effort designed to leverage the vast amounts of multiwavelength data in another prime deep extragalactic field , the extended groth strip ( egs ) .",
    "once completed , deep3 will yield keck / deimos spectra of @xmath8 sources at @xmath9 , which when combined with tkrs and this work will create an extensive spectral database that is both uniform and publicly - available . in sections [ sec_design ] and [ sec_redux ] , we describe the design , execution , and reduction of our keck / deimos observations in goods - n , with the data products presented in section [ sec_data ] .",
    "the @xmath10 spectra presented herein were distributed across @xmath11 keck / deimos slit masks , designed using the dsimulator software ( part of the deimos iraf package ) . in order to match the tkrs ,",
    "targets were selected down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 . however , while deimos @xmath12-band imaging was employed to select the tkrs sample , our spectroscopic targets were drawn from the optical imaging catalogs of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our observations cover a moderately wider area of sky than those of the tkrs , extending slightly beyond the borders of the goods _",

    "our slit masks were positioned , in part , to target sources detected at @xmath13 m and/or @xmath14 m by the fidel survey , but not observed by the tkrs or as part of the spectroscopic observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optical counterparts to the _",
    "spitzer_/mips sources were manually selected as part of the slit mask design , using the mips catalogs of @xcite , while sources with existing redshifts in the tkrs and @xcite catalogs were down - weighted . finally , the 2 ms _ chandra _ data in the goods - n field were reprocessed following the methodology of @xcite , with optical counterparts to the x - ray point sources being identified in the @xcite imaging using the likelihood ratio technique of @xcite .",
    "any x - ray sources lacking an existing spectroscopic redshift in the literature , were prioritized whenever possible .",
    "the total number of unique targets on the @xmath11 slit masks totals @xmath0 , with @xmath15 objects appearing on @xmath16 slit masks ( i.e. , we obtained @xmath10 spectra of @xmath0 unique targets ) .",

    "slits were tilted up to @xmath17 degrees relative to the mask position angle to align with the major axis of elongated targets ( i.e. , targets with an ellipticity @xmath18 ) . when possible , an object s ellipticity and the orientation of its major axis were estimated from the goods _",

    "spectroscopic observations using deimos were completed during the spring of 2009 and 2010 as detailed in table [ tab_obs ] .",
    "observations utilized the 600 lines mm@xmath22 grating blazed at @xmath23  and tilted to a central wavelength of @xmath24 , which yields a nominal spectral coverage of @xmath25 ",
    "@xmath26  at a resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath27 .",

    "standard calibration frames , consisting of three flat - field frames utilizing the internal quartz lamp and a single arc lamp spectrum ( using kr , ar , ne , and xe ) , were collected for each mask with the deimos flexure compensation system ensuring that the instrument light path for all calibration images matched the science images to better than @xmath32 pixels .    the transparency and seeing conditions varied from poor to fair , resuting in data of limited quality .",
    "the typical seeing varied from @xmath33 to @xmath34 with variable cloud cover and high humidity at times .",
    "in addition , our observations of mask 20 were affected by intermittent dropout of the 1b ccd amplifier in deimos .",
    "this issue , which impacted two of the four exposures for mask 20 , caused all data on one - eighth of the ccd array ( i.e. , the blue half of the spectrum for @xmath35 of all objects ) to be lost .",
    "as a result , the effective exposure time for the blue half of the spectra in slits 0 - 1 , 34 - 38 , 40 - 41 , and 44 - 62 of mask 20 ( @xmath36 slits in total ) is a factor of @xmath16 lower than that for the corresponding red half . the resulting variation in integration time with wavelength for each of these slits results in discontinuities in the associated object spectra",
    ". the spectra for a fraction of these objects still yield secure redshifts ( i.e. , present multiple identifiable spectral features , with a resolved [ oii ] @xmath37  doublet counting as two features ) ; however , care must be taken in any studies utilizing information from the blue halves of the spectra .",
