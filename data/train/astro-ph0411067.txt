    "relatively little is known about the submillimetre properties of `` normal '' galaxies in the local universe  _",
    "iras _ detected only the 10% of dust warm enough to emit in the far - ir [ 2 ] and prior to scuba there existed only a handful of submillimetre flux measurements or maps .",
    "m s / n map ( @xmath2 contours ) overlaid onto _ digitised sky survey _ optical image.,width=163 ]    the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) is the first large systematic submillimetre survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "it consists of a sample selected from the _ iras _ bright galaxy sample [ 3 ] , and a sample selected from the cfa optical redshift survey [ 6 ] . since scuba is sensitive to the large proportion of dust too cold to be detected by _ iras _ , whereas the _ iras_-selected sample is likely to have been biased toward galaxies containing warmer dust the optically - selected sample should , by definition , be free from temperature selection effects and would include any `` cold '' ( @xmath330k ) galaxies present .",
    "the 60 , 100 and 850@xmath4 m flux densities are well - fitted by single - temperature dust spectral energy distributions , with a mean best - fitting temperature for the sample @xmath5=32.4k and a mean dust emissivity index @xmath6=0.97 .",
    "this low value of @xmath6 may indicate that galaxies , across all hubble types , contain a significant proportion of dust colder than these temperatures .      for the optically - selected sample",
    "we see consistently lower values of @xmath6 than the _ iras _ sample , strongly indicating the presence of a significantly larger fraction of cold dust than in the _ iras_-selected galaxies .",
    "moreover , the marked differences between the distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath5 for the two samples indicates that galaxies across all hubble types contain significant amounts of cold dust .",
    "this can be seen clearly by comparing the submm : far - ir colours for the two slugs samples  we find a strong correlation between the 60:100@xmath4 m and 60:850@xmath4 m colours .",
    "the optically - selected galaxies occupy a distinctly different region of the plot , with much colder colours .",
    "this , together with the marked differences between the distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath5 for the two samples , indicates that not only are the two samples _ not _ sampling the same populations of galaxies but also that the optically - selected sample is probing a population of cold dusty galaxies `` missed '' by _",
    "iras_.        it was once thought that ellipticals were entirely devoid of dust and gas , but optical absorption studies now show that dust is usually present .",
    "dust masses for the @xmath7 of ellipticals detected by _",
    "iras _ have been found to be as much as a factor of 10100 higher when estimated from their fir emission compared to estimates from optical absorption , suggesting a diffuse cold dust component [ 4 ] ( and refs .",
    "therein ) and [ 1 ] . at @xmath8 m",
    "we detect 6 ellipticals , from a total of 11 ellipticals in the optically - selected sample , and find them to have dust masses in excess of @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "we are investigating this further with scuba observations of a larger sample of ellipticals .",
    "deep scuba surveys have been carried out , but a significant limitation in the interpretation of high - redshift surveys and studies of cosmological evolution has been the lack of a direct _ local _ measurement of the sub - mm luminosity function . until now ,",
    "most deep sub - mm investigations have started out from a local _ iras _",
    "60@xmath4 m lf and extrapolated to the sub - mm , which as shown by [ 3 ] does not produce the measured sub - mm lf . using the _ iras_-selected sample [ 3 ]",
    "produced the first direct estimate of the sub - mm lf . however , since the _ iras _ sample is biased toward galaxies with larger amounts of warmer dust its lf may also be subject to bias .    we have derived a direct @xmath8 m lf for the optically - selected sample . however , in order to better constrain the lf at the lower luminosity end we need more data points and we need to probe a wider range of luminosities .",
    "we do this using a method described by [ 5 ] : we determine an @xmath8 m lf using @xmath9 galaxies from the _ iras _ pscz survey  we predict their @xmath8 m luminosities by extrapolating their _ iras _ fluxes using our colour - colour relation ( fig .",
    "[ col ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ lf ] we compare the pscz - extrapolated and direct optically - selected lfs .",
    "we find them to be well - fitted by schechter functions and show that , whereas the slope of the _ iras_-selected lf at lower luminosities was steeper than -2 ( a submm `` olbers paradox '' ) , the pscz - extrapolated lf , as expected , flattens out at the low luminosity end and has a slope of -1.34 .",
    "we also compare the _ iras_-selected sample lf and find that such a sample consistently underestimates the 850@xmath4 m lf .",
