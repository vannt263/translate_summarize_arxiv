    "the deployment of heterogeneous networks ( hetnets )  @xcite is a cost - effective solution to ever - growing traffic demands .",
    "heterogeneity in their design is achieved through a multi - tier architecture , i.e. , a mix of macrocells and smaller cells , namely microcells , picocells and femtocells .",
    "the benefits of spatial spectrum reuse , which comes with the proximity between access network and end users , amply justify the new technical challenges . among such challenges is the likelihood of cross - tier interference brought about by intense frequency reuse in neighboring or overlapping cells .",
    "techniques to mitigate such superposition of transmission resources are already available , e.g. , icic ( inter - cell interference coordination ) .",
    "however , innovations and challenges introduced by the heterogeneity of future networks does not stop at cell coverage . as a further solution to improve spectrum utilization , user equipments ( ues )",
    "are expected to be able to communicate in a device - to - device ( d2d ) fashion  @xcite .",
    "such d2d links will be established on lte licensed bands , as foreseen by the 3gpp prose group working on release 12  @xcite . this communication paradigm ( commonly referred to as in - band underlay d2d )",
    "will likely be implemented under the control of the cellular infrastructure ( e.g. , base stations , bss )  @xcite . in d2d mode ,",
    "a ue ( called serving ue ) can forward to another ue content it has previously downloaded from a network node .",
    "however , the presence of a serving ue in a specific area is ephemeral , forcing resource allocation procedures to promptly adapt to changes in the availability of such nodes .    in our paper",
    ", we address the challenges above by proposing a model for heterogeneous , lte - based networks .",
    "we assume that radio resources in such a network are managed by an area controller , which forwards its decisions to bss , using a high - speed link @xcite .",
    "such a scenario accounts for the coexistence and integration between i2d ( infrastructure - to - device ) and network - controlled d2d communication paradigms . under this framework ,",
    "we answer the following questions : ( i ) which network node ( macrocell bs , microcell bs , ue ) should serve a ue and ( ii ) which radio resources should be used ? answers to these questions will aim at reducing interference owing to spatial reuse of radio resources , hence ensuring higher data rates .",
    "as a side effect , for a fixed amount of transferred data , this will also lead to a significant reduction in the system energy consumption .",
    "resource allocation in lte is performed on a short time period ( 1  ms ) basis .",
    "we therefore develop a system model using dynamic programming , which is particularly suitable to update decisions every time period .",
    "then , since the resource allocation problem in ( even simpler ) lte scenarios is known to be np - hard  @xcite , we apply approximate dynamic programming ( adp ) to solve the model .",
    "we remark that our adp methodology yields a very efficient solution strategy , which caters for the swiftness required by real - world lte scenarios .",
    "we compare our solution to a scenario representing today s networks , where standard eicic ( enhanced icic ) techniques are implemented and proportional fairness is used for traffic scheduling at bss .",
    "results highlight that the adp approach combines energy - efficiency with an increased throughput and it fully exploits the potentiality of d2d transfer .",
    "additionally , thanks to the limited interference when compared to the i2d paradigm , d2d can be effectively used to offload traffic from the cellular infrastructure , and even to replace some microcells .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . after discussing related work in sec .",
    "[ sec : relwork ] , we introduce the system under study and our main assumptions in sec .  [",
    "sec : system ] . the network model is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "[ sec : adp ] outlines the dynamic programming formulation of the problem and our adp solution .",
    "results derived in a realistic scenario are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the deployment of a multi - tier network where cells use the same radio resources is highly beneficial since it allows traffic offloading from macrocells to smaller cells @xcite .",
    "however , such scenario imposes the adoption of icic techniques , for which a good survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "additionally , eicic specifications in 3gpp rel.10  @xcite foresee the use of the cell range expansion ( cre ) in lte systems .",
    "such technique consists in adding a positive range expansion bias to the pilot downlink signal strength received from microcells so that more users connect to them .",
    "then , in order to mitigate the interference between overlaying macro- and microcells , macrocells may periodically mute their downlink transmissions in certain subframes ( called almost blank subframes - abss ) . by using abss for edge users",
    ", microcells can significantly improve their performance @xcite . in our work",
    ", we do not focus on eicic techniques , rather , we take a scenario implementing them as our term of comparison . unlike the above works , we assume the presence of an area controller that issues resource allocation and scheduling instructions to bss , through high - speed optical fiber connectivity @xcite . also , we assume both i2d and d2d communication paradigms in all cells .",
    "how d2d communication can be integrated with cellular networks and the applications it can support are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "this work presents a conceptual framework for the formulation of problems such as peer discovery , scheduling and resource allocation .",
    "the problem of resource allocation is also studied in  @xcite , where however only macrocell bss and d2d mode are considered .",
    "additionally , in  @xcite the d2d pairs wishing to exchange data are given at the outset ( i.e. , unlike our work ,  @xcite does not address the endpoint association problem ) .",
    "both @xcite formulate resource allocation as a mixed integer optimization problem , which is notoriously hard to solve , with @xcite also presenting a greedy heuristic .",
    "the work in  @xcite further compounds the problem by investigating the selection of the most suitable communication mode , still in a single - tier scenario with d2d .",
    "there , an analytical model is proposed , based on the assumption that the positions of bss and users can be modeled as a poisson point process . beside the different methodology and scope of the above studies ,",
    "we stress that our work addresses hetnets including macrocells , microcells and d2d .",
    "while  @xcite derives an optimal factor of spectrum partition between cellular and d2d communication , we aim at determining the endpoint that should serve each user and an efficient data scheduling , on a single radio resource basis .",
    "we consider a two - tier hetnet , including lte - based macrocells and microcells deployed in a urban environment .",
    "each cell , either macro or micro , is controlled by a base station ( bs ) , which is referred to as macrobs in the former case and as microbs in the latter . given the new , complex tasks and the ever increasing amount of traffic that the cellular infrastructure is expected to handle , we assume that bss have optical fiber connectivity to the core network , as envisioned by operators and network manufacturers @xcite .    the coverage of a bs ( either macrobs or microbs ) , is given by the area where the received strength of the bs pilot signal is higher than -70dbm @xcite .",
    "a ue under the coverage of both a macrobs and a microbs can be served by either of them . i2d and d2d information transfers take place in the same band and share the same frequency spectrum , i.e. , we assume in - band , underlay d2d communication .",
    "indeed , as shown in  @xcite , the in - band underlay d2d mode outperforms the overlay mode in terms of achieved throughput .",
    "in particular , in this work we focus on the lte downlink spectrum , although our model can be easily extended to consider other frequency bands , either uplink or unlicensed spectrum portions .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that most of the mobile and web traffic is represented by downloads from the internet  @xcite .",
    "additionally , based on the recent trend and standardization activities , we consider network - controlled ( or , equivalently , operator - controlled ) d2d communication  @xcite .",
    "this implies that , not only synchronization and security issues can be easily solved , but also ue pairs can be efficiently scheduled so as to use cellular resources even at high traffic load .",
    "we focus on unicast data transfers and assume that ues can be served by only one endpoint at the time . considering the most popular types of terminals , we also assume ues to be half - duplex , i.e. , they can not transmit and receive at the same time . in downlink direction , this implies that a ue receiving information from the cellular infrastructure can not simultaneously serve another ue .",
    "according to the lte specifications  @xcite , the minimum resource scheduling unit is referred to as a radio block ( rb ) .",
    "one rb consists of 12 subcarriers ( each 15  khz wide ) in the frequency domain and one subframe ( 1-ms long ) in the time domain .",
    "radio resource allocation is updated every subframe by an area controller in the core network , which assists bss in radio resource allocation and traffic scheduling .",
    "the area controller collects information on the channel quality from the bss and receives content requests from the users .",
    "note that bss are oblivious to higher - layer demands , namely , user content requests .",
    "from the collected information , the area controller allocates resources , i.e. , it determines ( i ) which endpoint ( among the possible ones : macrobs , microbs , or ue ) should serve each user , and ( ii ) which rb(s ) to employ for such communication .",
    "decisions taken by the area controller are issued to the bss , which forward them to the ues .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we compare the performance of the proposed system to a distributed scenario reflecting today s networks , where d2d is not supported and ues are always served according to the proportional fairness algorithm , by the bs whose received signal is the strongest .",

    "the dependency on time appears as a superscript , while that on a radio resource ( rb ) , or on a content , as subscript .",
    "the main symbols we use can be found in table  [ tab : notation ] . in the text",
    "we may also refer to variables through the corresponding symbol , but omitting their dependency on the system parameters .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the set of all bss .",
    "elements in  @xmath3 correspond to different kinds of network infrastructure , namely , macro- and microbss .",
    "we refer to a user equipped with a mobile terminal as , equivalently , user or ue , and define  @xmath4 as the set of users in the network area .",
    "the set of radio resources that can be assigned to a transmission is denoted by @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 is an rb in the downlink direction .",
    "recall that rbs are assigned to transmitters every 1  ms - subframe .",
    "we therefore divide time into a set of _ time steps _",
    "@xmath7 , each assumed to be equal to one subframe . in principle , all network nodes can use any rb at the same time , though each node uses its rbs in a time step to transmit to one other node only .",
    "also , a ue can be served by only one endpoint during one time step .",
    "endpoints of communication in our system depend on the chosen paradigm .",
    "given a data flow from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , @xmath9 is a downloader , while @xmath8 is a serving ue in d2d mode and a macrobs , or a microbs , in i2d mode .    0.95|c|x| symbol & description @xmath3 & set of bss @xmath10 & set of content items @xmath5 & set of radio resources ( rbs ) @xmath4 & set of users @xmath11 & size of content  @xmath12 @xmath13 & time step when user  @xmath14 becomes interested in content  @xmath12 @xmath15 & cumulative amount of data of content  @xmath12 that user  @xmath14 has downloaded until the beginning of time step  @xmath16 @xmath17 & amount of data that can be sent from  @xmath8 to  @xmath9 on rb  @xmath18 at time step  @xmath16 @xmath19 & amount of data of content  @xmath12 transferred from  @xmath8 to  @xmath9 at time step  @xmath16 ( over any possible rb )      the power with which endpoint  @xmath20 transmits to endpoint  @xmath9 is indicated by  @xmath21 . for i2d ( downlink ) transmissions ,",
    "the value of such parameter depends only on whether  @xmath8 is a macrobs or a microbs , i.e. ,  @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "conversely , we assume that the transmit power of a serving ue in d2d communication is subject to a closed - loop control , so that its value may depend on such factors as propagation conditions and positions of either endpoints .",
    "in addition , we define @xmath23 as the signal attenuation affecting the transmission between endpoints  @xmath24 .",
    "the attenuation depends on both the position and the type of the endpoints ( e.g. , on the height of the network node antennas ) .    in all cases , from the viewpoint of our model , power and attenuation",
    "are input values .",
    "thus , any assumption about propagation conditions and power control algorithms can be accommodated with no change to the model itself . in particular , in order to precompute @xmath23 , we adopt the itu urban propagation models specified in  @xcite for macro- and microbss , and the model in  @xcite for d2d communication .",
    "it is important to stress that , by including power and attenuation figures as an input to our model , we can obtain a remarkable level of realism , while keeping the complexity low .    given the transmit power and the attenuation factor , the useful power received at  @xmath9 from source  @xmath8 is  @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , considering a generic node pair @xmath26 communicating on the same rb where @xmath9 is receiving , the interference suffered by  @xmath9 can be written as @xmath27 . assuming that @xmath8 is transmitting to @xmath9 at time step @xmath16 on rb @xmath18 , the total interference experienced by @xmath9 is : @xmath28",
    "while the signal to noise plus interference ratio ( sinr ) is yielded by @xmath29 we can finally map the sinr onto the amount of data that can be transferred from @xmath8 to @xmath9 using rb @xmath18 during step @xmath16 .",
    "we indicate this amount by  @xmath17 , and we determine its value based on experimental measurements , as detailed later .",
    "we denote by  @xmath10 the set of content items that the users may request ( e.g. , videos , ebooks , maps , web pages ) . for each content item",
    "@xmath30 , we know the size  @xmath11 and the maximum delay  @xmath31 with which it should be delivered to a user ( e.g. , before the user loses interest in it ) .    for each user  @xmath32 , we introduce an input parameter to the model called _ want - time _ , @xmath33 , defined as the time step at which user @xmath14 becomes interested in content @xmath12 .",
    "we then indicate by  @xmath15 the total amount of content  @xmath12 that  @xmath14 has downloaded until the beginning of time step  @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath34 , and that such a quantity is non decreasing , i.e. ,  @xmath35 .",
    "we abuse the notation and define @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "that is , bss can download the whole content @xmath12 in negligible time ( recall that they are connected to the core network through optical fibers ) .",
    "we remark that partially - downloaded content items can be transferred on a d2d link , though limited to the portion available at the serving ue .",
    "variable  @xmath19 denotes the amount of data of content  @xmath12 transferred from endpoint @xmath8 to @xmath9 during time step @xmath16 , over all possible rbs .",
    "thus , we have the following inequality : @xmath38 in ( [ eq : chi ] ) , strict inequality holds when @xmath8 is a serving ue and the total amount of data it is caching for @xmath9 is smaller than what could be transferred over the link between the two nodes .",
    "in the following , we introduce the model we developed using the standard dynamic programming methodology . as shown by previous work @xcite ,",
    "the problem of radio resource allocation in lte - based systems is np - hard , even when less complex scenarios than ours are considered .",
    "thus , we resort to approximate dynamic programming in order to solve the model in realistic , large - scale scenarios .",
    "dynamic programming is an optimization technique based on breaking a complex problem into simpler , typically time - related , subproblems .",
    "since scheduling in lte systems occurs every subframe , we solve the resource allocation problem every time step @xmath16 .",
    "a dynamic programming model consists of the following elements ( denoted by bold - face latin letters )  @xcite :    * the _ state variable _ , @xmath39 , which describes the state of the system at time  @xmath16 ; * the _ action _ set , @xmath40 i.e. , all possible decisions that can be taken at time  @xmath16 ; * an exogenous ( and potentially stochastic ) _ information process _ , accounting for information on the system becoming available at time @xmath16 ; * the _ cost _ of an action , @xmath41 , i.e.",

    "clearly , at time  @xmath16 we only know those want - times  @xmath48 .",
    "an action is a set of triplets , each defining which endpoint @xmath8 should serve downloader @xmath9 and using which rb @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath49 . in simpler terms , an action is a realization of resource allocation .",

    "we become aware of which content items have been recently requested , hence we can determine the next system state .",
    "[ fig : dp - flow ]  ( right ) offers a more detailed view .",
    "the starting point is given by the current state  @xmath39 and the set of actions describing the possible resource allocations ( steps 1 and 2 in the figure ) .",
    "for each action , we compute the potential @xmath50 and , then , the actual @xmath51 amount of data that can be transferred between every pair of endpoints ( steps 34 ) . given the variables @xmath52 , we update the total amount of data that each downloader @xmath9 can obtain by the beginning of the next time step as , @xmath53    for each action  @xmath44 , we can then evaluate the cost @xmath41 the system incurs if @xmath44 is selected ( step 5 in fig .",

    ", it is the cost that will be paid in the future , after the system has reached state  @xmath43 .",
    "state values do not normally admit a closed - form expression . in standard dynamic programming  (",
    "3 ) , they are computed by accounting for all possible states and actions , typically leading to an exceedingly high complexity in non - toy scenarios .",
    "we address such an issue in the following section .",
    "once @xmath56 and @xmath42 have been computed for all actions , the action @xmath57 minimizing the cost @xmath58 is selected ( step 7 in fig .",

    "given @xmath57 , the corresponding amount of transferred data can be calculated ( steps 8 - 9 ) .",

    "[ alg : compute - delta ] ) and @xmath19 ( alg .",
    "[ alg : compute - chi ] ) , taking into account the interference due to the spatial reuse of radio resources .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in spite of its apparent intricacy and high level of realism , the process we describe below has a very low computational complexity , namely  @xmath59 .",

    "we perform such mapping by using the experimental values in  @xcite .    algorithm  [ alg : compute - chi ] instead refers to steps 4 and 9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp - flow ]  ( right ) ) .",
    "the algorithm takes as input the action  @xmath60 and the amount of data @xmath17 that can be potentially transferred as a consequence of this action ( computed through alg .",
    "[ alg : compute - delta ] ) .",
    "then , for each pair of active endpoints and assigned rb , it selects which content to transmit .",
    "this is done in line  [ line : chi - select - content ] , giving priority to incompletely transferred content items that were requested first .",
    "note that the conditional loop in line  [ line : chi - while ] reflects the fact that data from multiple content can be accommodated in the same rb , if needed .",
    "in particular , in line  [ line : chi - compute - y ] , for each item the data transferred on rb  @xmath18 is determined : this amount , indicated by @xmath71 , is given by the minimum between the amount of data that source @xmath8 still has for downloader @xmath9 and the amount of data that can still be accommodated in the rb .",
    "finally , the @xmath52-value is obtained by summing the @xmath72 values over all rbs ( line  [ line : chi - update - chi ] ) .",
    "notwithstanding the low complexity implied by the computation of the @xmath73 and @xmath52 quantities , standard dynamic programming itself is affected by the well - known `` curse of dimensionality ''  @xcite , which makes it impractical for all but very small scenarios .",
    "what causes such problem is the exceedingly large set of possible actions and the aforementioned complexity in the evaluation of the future cost @xmath74 . as an example , consider the set  @xmath75 of possible actions that can be taken at time step @xmath16 , which includes all possible sets of  @xmath46 triplets .",
    "there are  @xmath76 such tuples and , thus , a total of  @xmath77 possible actions  @xmath78 .",
    "some of these actions can be discarded as meaningless , e.g. , allocating rbs to a ue that already completed its download .",
    "others , e.g. , having a ue receive from more than one endpoint in the same time step , or receiving a content while transmitting to another ue , are ruled out by technology constraints  @xcite .",
    "however , the very fact that the size of  @xmath75 grows exponentially with the number of ues , bss and rbs makes a standard dynamic programming model not scalable . for a similar reason , the evaluation of @xmath74 stemming from @xmath75",
    "is exceedingly cumbersome .",
    "indeed , one should consider all possible system evolutions starting from the current state , by selecting at each future time step the optimal action .",
    "thus , we resort to adp and propose the algorithms below so as to efficiently generate and rank actions , hence finding a solution with low computational complexity .",
    "recall that the immediate cost @xmath79 of each action can be evaluated with very low complexity , thanks to algs .",
    "[ alg : compute - delta ] and  [ alg : compute - chi ] .",
    "thus , in order to ensure scalability , it is sufficient to act along two directions : ( i ) making the number of actions to be evaluated at each time step smaller and independent of the number of ues and bss , and ( ii ) reducing the complexity of evaluating the future cost @xmath74 of an action .",
    "of course , it is not possible to achieve such a result while keeping the optimality guarantee .",
    "however , such an approach has been shown to be very effective  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  1 ) , as also confirmed by our performance evaluation in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "below , we describe how we tackle the two issues .",
    "we define an auxiliary action space  @xmath80 , whose size is much smaller than the original action space  @xmath75 and , more importantly , does not grow with the number of ues or bss . then , we show a deterministic ( and computationally efficient ) way to map an action  @xmath81 of the auxiliary action space into an action  @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that the actions we evaluate ( steps 57 in fig .  [",
    "fig : dp - flow ]  ( right ) ) are only those @xmath78 that have a correspondence in @xmath80 .    to determine the auxiliary action space , we proceed as follows .",
    "we ask ourselves what kind of choice has the highest relevance in a system such as ours .",
    "the most significant one is to rank transfer paradigms , i.e. , using macrobss , microbss or d2d  and test which combination of them yields the highest throughput and carries the least interference .",
    "we thus represent the `` importance '' of each paradigm by a triplet of real values  @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "these values indicate which endpoints should be preferably used , as shown in alg .",
    "[ alg : choose - endpoints ] , and each triplet represents an auxiliary action @xmath83 . for the set of auxiliary actions to be manageable , we need to discretize each value in the @xmath84 triplet .",
    "the set  @xmath80 is thus finite and we can control its size by choosing the granularity of each @xmath84 .",

    "notice that by selecting only one endpoint in line  [ line : ce - select - best ] , we honor the technology constraint by which each user can download data from at most one source in a given time step . in the following line ,",
    "we assign to the endpoint pair @xmath97 the rb that maximizes their @xmath91 score . however , before including the new triplet @xmath98 in the allocation yielded by @xmath44 , we check whether the total amount of data transferred in the network increases or not ( lines  [ line : check - gain - b][line : check - gain - e ] ) . while verifying that , we resort again to algs .

    "d2d mode is not supported and ues connect to the bs from which they receive the strongest pilot signal . at the bss , traffic is scheduled according to the proportional - fairness ( pf ) algorithm , which is standard in today s lte networks  @xcite . in the following , we will refer to this benchmark scenario as pf .    the first comparison between adp and pf is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint ] .",
    "colors are used to differentiate among the possible endpoints ( black for macrobss , gray for microbss and red for ues ) and between adp ( orange ) and pf ( blue ) . in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](a ) shows that adp allows the transfer of more data than the state - of - the - art , while using a much smaller amount of energy .",
    "such a gain is due to the lower usage of macrocells ( characterized by very high transmit power ) , in favour of microcells and d2d .",
    "note that the energy consumption due to d2d mode is negligible and can be barely seen in the plot .",
    "also , under both adp and pf , transmissions from microbss are more efficient than those from macrobss , as the former carry a higher amount of data at a much lower energy cost .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](b ) depicts the completion time of successful downloads , for the different content categories ( denoted by a different colors ) .",
    "a download is successful if it can be completed by the corresponding deadline .",
    "first , note that , since video and viral content have tighter deadlines , they are characterized by better performance than ebooks .",
    "indeed , our cost @xmath79 in  ( [ eq : dp - contribution ] ) accounts for content deadlines , giving higher priority to those downloads that are closer to their completion deadline . comparing adp ( solid lines ) to pf ( dotted lines ) , we observe that our approach can better meet the time requirements of content with strict deadlines ( video and viral ) , while guaranteeing similar delays for ebooks .",
    "results in fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](c ) confirm the above observation : adp can dramatically reduce the number of failed downloads with respect to pf .",
    "the only content type for which adp is unable to deliver some items is video .",
    "this due to the fact that , in the traffic scenario under study , video has a quite strict deadline , and it can not significantly benefit from the d2d mode as users typically ask for different items .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](d ) highlights the improvement in adp usage of radio resources compared to pf .",
    "observe that , on average , adp can transmit a higher amount of data per rb , as our interference - aware scheduling assigns endpoints and radio resources far more efficiently than the pf - based system . in other words ,",
    "adp scheduling yields higher values of sinr , hence of data rates per rb .",
    "this is also underlined by the average number of times an rb is reused in the whole network , whose value normalized to the network area is about 1.58 under adp and 2.3 under pf .",
    "the higher value recorded under pf may at first be surprising , given that adp allows d2d communication to reuse rbs too .",
    "however , such result further underscores the inefficiency of pf in handling interference : it needs to reuse more rbs in order to keep up with traffic demand . at last , looking at different types of endpoints , we note that rbs assigned to macro- and microbs by pf are characterized by similar data rates , in spite of the lower power irradiated by microbs .",
    "such behavior is due to the use of abs , which mutes macrocells when microcells serve far - away ues , and to the short distance between microbss and the other ues .",
    "conversely , when adp assigns rbs to microbss , the difference in data rates between macrocells and microcells flares up .",
    "indeed , d2d communication causes additional interference to ues served by the cellular infrastructure , which is more significant for microbss since they transmit at a lower power level . as for d2d mode ,",
    "it exhibits slightly worse performance than i2d communication .",
    "this was expected , since serving ues transmit at very low power , hence d2d communication is more prone to interference ( hence lower sinr and data rate ) .",
    "[ fig : neu - sep ] presents the breakdown of delivered data under adp and pf , on a per - content type basis . in spite of the lower transmission quality , d2d appears to play a crucial role in the delivery of viral content , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - sep](a ) .",
    "indeed , in case of a peak of social content demand , it is likely that a downloader finds a serving ue within its radio range .",
    "thus , d2d can be effectively used to offload traffic from the cellular infrastructure . on the contrary",
    ", pf has to relay on macro- and microbss only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - sep](b ) ) . as a consequence , along with a better exploitation of radio resources",
    ", adp requires a much lower energy per transferred data compared to pf , as evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : neu - sep](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in particular , the adp plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - sep](c ) underscores that the energy consumption due to d2d communication , normalized to the amount of downloaded data , is negligible , thus confirming that d2d mode is a very convenient way to spread social content .    in the scenario",
    "above , we now halve the number of microcells from 228 to 114 , i.e. , 2 microcells per macrocell .",
    "the most noticeable effect is that , with adp , d2d communication steps up to compensate for the missing microbss , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fewerbs - joint](a ) .",
    "instead , pf falls short of providing the same throughput as before .",
    "indeed , comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](a ) , adp exhibits a mere 8% drop in transferred data , with respect to 30% for pf .",
    "energy consumption increases for both approaches , though adp still retains a clear edge . a breakdown of per - content data downloaded by adp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neu - joint](b ) ) shows that d2d is even more dominant ( by a 32% increase ) in viral transfers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fewerbs - joint](c ) , spectrum usage is less effective with the increase in d2d communication : the surging number of d2d links interferes more with macrobss and the remaining microbss . those d2d links",
    "whose coverage overlaps one of the missing microcells instead see their amount of transferred bits per rb increase . in fig .  [",
    "fig : fewerbs - joint](d ) , viral content relying more on d2d shows the same completion times as before , while video and ebooks experience higher delays .",
    "the latter phenomenon is a consequence of the lower number of microcells .",
    "also , adp tends to favour content with stricter time constraints ( viral and video ) , at the expense of ebooks . for reasons of space , we omit plots comparing other metrics , which however confirm the above observations .",
    "we considered a 2-tier , lte - based network , supporting d2d communication .",
    "we devised a solution to the problem of selecting which endpoint should serve a user , and the radio resources to allocate for such communication . in particular , we presented approximate dynamic programming algorithms to generate and rank possible resource allocation decisions . in this way",
    ", we obtained a low - complexity solution that can deal with realistic , large - scale scenarios .",
    "our results show the good performance of our solution , as well as the conditions under which d2d communication is more effective .",
    "furthermore , we highlight that d2d mode can be a valid , low - cost alternative to microcells in supporting traffic with little energy consumption .",
