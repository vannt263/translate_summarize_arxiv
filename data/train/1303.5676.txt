    "such metric space is compact ( theorem [ t : continuoushullcompact ] ) , and unlike its discrete counterpart , this substitution map is a homeomorphism ( theorem [ t : omegahomeomorphism ] ) .",
    "the extension is of course not unique , but it is a natural one , and we did several attempts to obtain it by playing around with possible topologies preserving the cellular structure , and possible metrics .",
