    "analysing the well - resolved stellar and gas kinematics of disk galaxies provides insights into their rotational and non - rotational components , both of which can be measured as a function of radius and disk height .",

    "high - resolution spectroscopic data cubes ( targeting , eg . , the hi , co , and h@xmath0  spectral lines ) also allow us to determine the 3d shape of galaxies , including their warped disks .",

    "i then construct 3d visualisations of the observed galaxies based on multi - wavelength imaging and spectral line cubes at various angular resolutions , allowing me to analyse and improve the 3d representation of each galaxy until it reflects the observed data and knowledge derived from the data .",
    "another benefit of the re - constructed 3d particle model is the ability to view each galaxy from any angle and produce fly - through movies ( as presented for the galaxy m83 ) . in this first attempt ,",

    "radio synthesis telescopes like the atca , which consists of six 22-m dishes , have been recording large spectral line data cubes for over two decades .",
    "the atca primary beam is @xmath10.5 degr at 21-cm ; hi  emission from nearby galaxies within this large field of view can be mapped with angular resolutions of up to @xmath110 arcsec and velocity resolution of less than 1  kms@xmath2 .",
    "much higher resolutions are typically used when observing molecular lines ( atca receivers cover frequencies from 1 to 105  ghz observable with two 2  ghz - wide bands ; wilson et al .",
    "+        askap , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( johnston et al .",
    "2008 ) , which will be fully equipped with novel wide - field phased array feeds ( pafs ) , is just starting to deliver the first well - resolved hi  maps of nearby galaxies and groups .",
    "we are currently observing with six of the 36 antennas , forming nine beams ( each with fwhm @xmath11  degr ) which can be placed anywhere within the 30 sq degr field - of - view .",

    "the recording bandwidth is 300  mhz divided into around 17000 channels giving a velocity resolution of 4  kms@xmath2 .",
    "the angular resolution of the current 6-antenna array , known as the boolardy engineering test array ( beta ; hotan et al . 2014 ) is @xmath11 arcmin ; the frequency coverage is 700 to 1800  mhz .",
    "+ askap is a powerful 21-cm survey machine and will  once fully equipped with the equivalent of wide - field ifus  be mapping the neutral hydrogen line in emission and absorption over the whole southern sky and a good fraction of the northern sky .",
    "several large askap hi  surveys are planned . here",
    "i briefly introduce wallaby , a 21-cm survey of the sky ( @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ) which in about one year of observing time will detect more than 500000 galaxies in the hi  spectral line ( duffy et al .",

    "novel chequerboard pafs are providing 30 sq degr instantaneous field - of - view .",
    "in wallaby @xmath11000 galaxies will have hi  diameters larger than 5  arcmin ( @xmath510 beams ) and @xmath15000 galaxies will have major - axis hi  diameters greater than 2.5 arcmin ( @xmath55 beams ) , allowing us to study in detail their morphology , kinematics and mass distribution . the number would rise to @xmath6 galaxies if all 36 askap antennas could be used ; the additional six antennas provide baselines up to 6  km , resulting in an angular resolution of 10@xmath7 . creating highly reliable and complete source catalogs requires sophisticated source - finding algorithms as well as accurate source parametrisation .",
    "we are aiming to achieve this with our new _",

    "a common way of analysing a galaxy s hi  velocity field is to carefully fit tilted ring models ( de blok et al .",

    "the resulting residual velocity field is a good indicator of the goodness of fit and any remaining peculiar ( non - rotational ) structures .",
    "tilted ring fits retrieve structural parameters , such as position angle , inclination and rotational velocity , as a function of radius when a galaxy is moderately well resolved .",
    "several well - tested algorithms / programs exist , most of which are applied to the 2d velocity field . in some cases , for example edge - on disks and large well - resolved hi  disks of galaxies , 3d modelling of the hi  data cubes is of advantage ( eg .",

    "[ fig : koribalski - fig1 ] ) and fit them with one or more of the algorithms described below .",
    "we base this approach on our successful sofia package ( serra et al .",
    "assuming circular symmetry , the fitted rings allow an accurate description of warped galaxy disks where both inclination , @xmath8 , and position angle , @xmath9 , vary with radius @xmath10 .",
    "this is necessary to correctly deproject the measured rotational velocities to derive the galaxy rotation curve , @xmath11 .",

    "_ diskfit _ was created for the kinematic modeling of barred spiral galaxies .",
    "it does not allow the fitting of warped disk where the inclination and position angles vary with radius .",
    "diskfit builds on _ velfit _ ( spekkens & sellwood 2007 ) . the _ kinemetry _ technique ( krajnovic et al .",
    "2006 ) was devised to model the stellar velocity fields of early - type galaxies .",
    "in the following i will use the grand - design spiral galaxy as an example of 3d hi  mapping .",
    "the hi  envelope of m83 is much more extended than the well - known stellar disk .",
    "a prominent tidal arm hints at gravitational interactions with its dwarf galaxy neighbours while the western edge of the gas appears compressed , possibly affected by ram pressure stripping .",

    "the hi  gas dynamics appear increasingly peculiar towards the outer regions which show clear signs of tidal disruption .",
    "the most prominent tidal features of m83 are the one - sided outer hi  arm which can be traced over 180 degr from the western to the eastern side , and the spectacular stellar stream , consisting of mainly old stars , to the north ; their origin and possible relation are explored .",

    "the hi  appearance of m83 clearly suggests that it has been and possibly still is interacting with neighbouring dwarf galaxies .",
