    "for more than thirty years it is known that glasses display anomalous behavior for temperatures in the kelvin regime.@xmath0 for example , the temperature dependence of the specific heat turns out to be linear rather than cubic , as expected from the debye model .",
    "the standard tunneling model ( stm ) predicts many of these features.@xmath1 the key idea is to assume that the system can perform local transitions between adjacent configurations . because of the low temperatures the crossing of the barriers occurs via tunneling",
    "this feature can be characterized by a double - well potential ( dwp ) in configuration space , i.e. two adjacent local minima on the potential energy landscape ( pel ) . in general",
    ", the reaction coordinate corresponds to a highly cooperative process in which a group of neighboring atoms is involved . among all dwp which are present in a given glassy configuration only those dwp with asymmetries less than , lets say , 2 k will contribute to the low - temperature anomalies .",
    "in contrast , typical energy scales for , e.g. , sio@xmath2 are of the order of 1ev and thus many orders of magnitude higher .",
    "thus one would expect that only a minor fraction of all dwp are relevant for the low - temperature anomalies .",
    "they are denoted two - level systems ( tls ) .",
    "there is no theory which predicts the properties of tls from first principles without invoking some model assumptions .",
    "there are , however , interesting approaches within different physical frameworks like a mean - field model @xmath3 and random first order transition theory.@xmath4 in the second approach a detailed picture of the pel in terms of mosaics is derived . in their model",
    "the reaction coordinate of tls involves the dynamics of @xmath5 ) molecules which only move a small fraction of a nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "finally , in the stm some reasonable assumptions about the properties of the potential parameters of the tls are made .",
    "computer simulations are well suited to elucidate the properties of tls .",
    "two steps are involved .",
    "first , one has to generate a typical glassy configuration and , second , to identify nearby adjacent minima on the pel and characterize the nature of the individual transitions .",
    "qualitatively , one would expect that the active atoms for one transition are localized in some region in the glass .",
    "the first simulations used non - systematic search methods.@xmath6 in subsequent work heuer and silbey have introduced a method how to search tls in a systematic way.@xmath7 applying this method to a binary mixture lennard - jones ( bmlj ) system they were able to predict the real - space realization of the tls @xmath7 , the coupling to strain , @xmath8 the prediction of tunneling properties in terms of material constants and , as a consequence , a universal description of the low - temperature anomalies.@xmath9 important results about the properties of dwp in lennard - jones systems can be also found in refs .",
    "@xmath10 . for all simulations one has to take into account that the absolute number of tls is so small that there is no chance to identify a sufficiently large number via simulations . in contrast",
    ", the number of dwp is very large .",
    "therefore an important ingredient of these simulations is the formulation of a statistical method how to predict the properties of tls from those of dwp . using the",
    "significantly improved computer facilities during the last decade , the present authors have recently reanalyzed the bmlj system .@xmath11 in particular , it could be shown that ( 1 ) the systematic search algorithm indeed allows one to obtain an estimation of the absolute number of tls , ( 2 ) the properties of the tls basically do not depend on the energy of the configuration .",
    "thus , the intrinsic computer limitations like the necessity of a very fast cooling procedure to generate the initial configuration or the choice of relatively small systems do not hamper the unbiased determination of tls properties in the bmlj system .",
    "a prototype glass - forming system is vitreous silica ( sio@xmath2 ) .",
    "trachenko et al have characterized the tls of silica in several respects and have shown that the microscopic nature is related to coupled rotations of sio@xmath12 tetrahedra.@xmath13 a similar picture has been suggested from experimental neutron data @xmath14 and from the analysis of localized vibrational modes . @xmath15",
    "the transition events have been also analyzed via the activation - relaxation technique.@xmath16 the present authors have conducted a systematic search for tls in silica.@xmath17 it has been possible to estimate the experimentally observed number of tls which has turned out to be a factor of approx .",
    "3 smaller than the experimental tls density reported for suprasil w. as argued in ref.@xmath17 there are two possible reasons for a slight underestimation by computer simulations which are connected with the estimation of the tunneling matrix element . going beyond the wkb - approximation one might additionally take into account that ( i ) the saddles are broader ( in terms of second derivatives ) than the minima ( see also refs.@xmath18 ) and ( ii ) there is a franck - condon factor , taking into account the relaxation of the phonon modes during the transition within a dwp.@xmath19 both effects would increase the estimation of the number of tls and might at least partly account for the remaining difference .    in general , one may distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic tls.@xmath20 the extrinsic tls may be related to extrinsic defects like oh - impurities . actually , comparing suprasil i ( 1250 ppm oh - impurities ) with suprasil w ( < 5 ppm oh - impurities ) the experimentally determined number of tls is nearly twice as high .",
    "this may be related to the additional contribution of extrinsic tls.@xmath20 for the intrinsic tls two different contributions may be of relevance .",
    "first , they may be related to tls where _ intrinsic _ defects of the silica system are involved .",
    "they are characterized by non - tetrahedral local coordination like non - bridging oxygen atoms .",
    "second , intrinsic tls may also be present in defect - free silica configurations which recently have been analyzed in ref.@xmath17 .",
    "intuitively , one might expect that defective configurations ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) are more efficient to locally reorganize and thus to form tls .",
    "both , the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic defects , will be relevant for a closer rationalization of the low - temperature anomalies in systems like suprasil .    in previous work on a bmlj system the properties of extrinsic defects",
    "have been analyzed in detail.@xmath21 for this purpose one has included a test lennard - jones particle with variable radius and analyzed the dwp , related to this particle . some dramatic effects have been observed when analyzing a test particle with a radius which is e.g. 25% smaller than the radius of the smaller component of the bmlj system ( data compared with the properties of the majority component ) :",
    "( i ) the probability for the formation of a dwp has increased by a factor of approx .",
    "50 , ( ii ) the number of particles , involved in the dwp , has decreased by more than a factor of 2 , ( iii ) the average saddle height of the dwp has increased by a factor of nearly 2 , ( iv ) the deformation potential has decreased by 25% .    in this work",
    "we explicitly compare the nature of the tls of defect - free silica with those of silica containing intrinsic defects and/or extrinsic defects , modelled by a small concentration of li@xmath2o .",
    "it will turn out that all types of tls have very different properties . on a qualitative level , many features for the extrinsic defects will turns out to be similar to what has been observed for the test particle in the bmlj system , as sketched above . to underline the interpretation of the results ,",
    "we compare them with the respective observations for the bmlj system and with experimental data .",
    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been conducted under nve - conditions .",
    "the velocity verlet scheme has been chosen to propagate the particles in time .",
    "the md simulations were basically used to generate large numbers of independent structure , which then were analyzed for the occurrence of dwp .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been applied .      as a lj - model glass former",
    "we chose a binary mixture system with 80% large a - particles and 20% small b - particles ( bmlj).@xmath22 it is supposed to represent nip ( 80% @xmath23ni ; 20% @xmath24p ) but with a 20% higher particle density.@xmath25 this system was first used by kob and anderson .",
    "the used potential is of the type @xmath26    + ( a + b\\cdot r),\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "a linear function @xmath32 was added to ensure continuous energies and forces at the cutoff @xmath33 .",
    "the units of length , mass and energy are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the time step within these units was set to @xmath37 . for the case of nip",
    "the energy unit corresponds to 934 k and @xmath34 is 2.2   .",
    "the presented data are taken from our smallest simulated system with 65 particles .",
    "the finite size effects have already been analyzed in ref.@xmath11 and are small enough to be neglected .",
    "the pure silica system has been modeled by the bks - potential.@xmath38 we have analyzed system sizes of n=150 and n=600 particles . if not mentioned otherwise the data in this work refer to @xmath39 .",
    "the system has the standard density of 2.3 @xmath40 and a short - range cutoff of the bks - potential of 8.5  .",
    "the starting configurations for the systematic search correspond to equilibrium configurations at 3000 k , which subsequently were minimized . we have obtained starting structures with and without intrinsic defects , i.e. deviations from a perfect tetrahedral coordination . due to the fact , that defect related dwp  may be relevant , though the number of defects is very small,@xmath41 we do not only analyze the defect free dwp  but also the defect related dwp .    to define the coordination of a silicon atom in a classical pair potential",
    "it is necessary to introduce maximum bond cutoffs to determine if a bond exists or not .",
    "the minimum between the first and the second nn - shell in the radial distribution functions for the minimized structures lies around @xmath42 .",
    "this value has thus been used as a cutoff to define bonds , si  o distances below this value are considered bonds and larger distances are not .",
    "the general results do not critically depend on the used cutoff value as a broad minimum region between the two nearest - neighbor - shells exists .      for the alkali silica simulations a 153 particle system with only 2 li - atoms has been used .",
    "the low lithium concentration guarantees , that the li - atoms behave almost independently and that the network structure is rather similar to that of pure silica .",
    "the potential has been taken from habasaki and okada.@xmath43 its alkali - free limit is close to the bks - potential .",
    "the simulations have been conducted under the same conditions as for pure silica .",
    "the key idea of our search algorithm is to start from one minimized configuration , i.e. a local minimum of the pel , and then to perform a specified number of md steps . afterwards the system is minimized again .",
    "when this procedure ends in a configuration which is different from the starting configuration it is checked whether there exists a saddle point between both configurations .",
    "if yes , one has identified one dwp .",
    "this procedure is repeated many times ( typically : 100 times ) in order to identify most if not all dwp .",
    "a dwp is characterized by three parameters : its asymmetry @xmath44 , its potential height @xmath45 and its distance between both minima @xmath46 .",
    "more specifically we either use the euclidean distance @xmath46 or the mass - weighted distance @xmath47 along the reaction path.@xmath48 since these differences are not relevant in the context of the present work they will be neglected in what follows . for the determination of the saddle a robust saddle search routine has been chosen.@xmath24    a dwp is kept for the further analysis if @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are specified values . this limitation is essential to enable a systematic search .",
    "dwp with , e.g. , very large values of the asymmetry are difficult to find such that a systematic search of _ all _ dwp ( starting from a given configuration ) is not possible within reasonable computer time .",
    "in contrast , if one is only interested in dwp within the range , specified above , one may hope to find ( nearly ) all dwp .",
    "as will be shown below , the tls are confined to this range , i.e. tls with @xmath53 are irrelevant .    a simple way to estimate",
    "the degree of completeness of the search procedure is to analyze how often a specific dwp is found during the repeated simulations .",
    "it has been shown that for appropriately chosen parameters a systematic search for dwp is indeed possible for the bmlj system @xmath48 as well as for silica @xmath17 and properties of tls , i.e. of nearly symmetric dwp , can be extracted . for a successful assessment of tls properties",
    "one first has to deal with the strong positive correlations among all three parameters @xmath46 , @xmath45 , and @xmath44 .",
    "guided by the soft - potential model @xmath54 we have mapped the distribution @xmath55 on a distribution of soft - potential parameters @xmath56 which fortunately to a very approximation turn out to be independent of each other .",
    "based on the independent distribution functions @xmath57 it is possible to generate a sufficiently large set of dwp with the same statistical properties as the initial set of dwp . in this way",
    "one can cover the full parameter range with high precision and in particular obtain the distribution of tls as a subset of the whole parameter range . a closer description of this _ parametrization method _ as well as further technical details can be found in refs.@xmath11 .",
    "the parameters , used for our simulations , are given in tab.1 .",
    "for the characterization of the dwp we first determine which particle moves most during the transition .",
    "this particle is denoted _ central _ particle .",
    "for bmlj we have therefore distinguished a - type dwp where the central particle is an a - particle and , analogously , b - type dwp .",
    "for silica we have defined dwp@xmath58  as the subset of dwp where the initial and the final configuration are defect - free and no bond breaking occurs during the transition .",
    "the remaining set is denoted dwp@xmath59 . for lithium silicate",
    "we define dwp@xmath60  as those dwp for which one of the two lithium atoms is the central particle .",
    "the number of dwp , found in our simulations , are also listed in tab.1 .",
    ". [ tab1]the number of dwp analyzed for all different systems ( system sizes : n=65 for bmlj ; n=150 for silica ; n=153 for lithium silica ) .",
    "they were recorded if their values of @xmath46 and @xmath44 satisfy @xmath50 and @xmath49 , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have performed the same analysis for the other two cases .",
    "the results for the values of @xmath61 and the dipole moment are given in tab.[dipole ] .",
    "interestingly , the experimental value for oh - defects is approx .",
    "4 d which is close to the value for tls@xmath60  as well as tls@xmath59 .",
    "thus , it appears that oh - defects and li - defects have a similar transition mechanism during their tunneling motion .    in recent work eq.[eqmallg ] has been derived , using a somewhat different notation.@xmath62 the derivation was based on the ideas of the random first order transition theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 was empirically introduced as a phenomenological constant ( @xmath64 ) which is needed to recover the experimentally determined dipole moment of tls@xmath58 .",
    "it has been postulated that @xmath65 is the effective partial charge , stemming from a coulomb charge on a bead , which is much smaller than the electron charge @xmath66.@xmath62 in contrast , in the present work we can show that the smallness of @xmath63 can be fully explained by the complex motional mechanism of the tls transitions in silica .",
    "via extended computer simulations we have analyzed the properties of the dwp in silica and lithium silicate .",
    "most importantly , the typical limitations of computer simulations , i.e. finite - time ( resulting in fast quenching rates ) and finite - size effects , do not hamper the characterization of the dwp within statistical uncertainties .",
    "the latter point can be concluded from the fact that the dwp properties do not depend on the energy of the initial glassy configuration and , in general , for small systems the energy is most relevant for predicting the dynamic properties.@xmath24 this is analogous to the case of bmlj .",
    "we should note in passing that for the bmlj system properties like the vibrational density depend on the energy of the configuration and thus on the cooling rate.@xmath67 in contrast , for silica even the vibrational properties are to a large extent independent of energy.@xmath68 a quantitative estimation of the number of dwp was possible for the bmlj system and the dwp@xmath58 .",
    "in contrast , for dwp@xmath59   and dwp@xmath60  a complete search for dwp was not possible within accessible computer times .",
    "however , one could obtain reasonable lower bounds for the number of dwp .",
    "the lithium ions in lithium silicate may be regarded as a prototype system for extrinsic defects , immersed in a pure glass former .",
    "the dwp with lithium as central particle , i.e. the tls@xmath60 mainly correspond to single lithium transitions . on a qualitative level",
    "the situation is similar to the case of the small b - particles in the bmlj system which may be regarded as defects being added to the larger a - particles .",
    "also in this case the average dwp resembles a single - particle transition ( this holds even more for a small test particle in the bmlj system ) .",
    "furthermore , in both cases the probability to form dwp is significantly higher than in the remaining glass ( a - particles in bmlj and silica in lithium silicate ) .",
    "thus extrinsic defects are very efficient in prompting the formation of dwp .",
    "the transitions in dwp@xmath58  and dwp@xmath59  as well as the a - type dwp in the bmlj system involve the displacement of a somewhat larger number of particles as reflected by larger values of the participation ratio .",
    "this spatial extension , however , is still relatively small as compared to some general predictions about the nature of tls.@xmath69    a closer analysis shows that dwp@xmath58  and dwp@xmath59 , i.e. dwp in a configuration without defects and with defects , respectively , behave very differently .",
    "the transition dynamics for dwp@xmath58  can be characterized as coupled rotations of sio@xmath12-tetrahedra . in particular",
    "this gives rise to a very small value of the dipole moment of this transition , i.e. a very small effective charge transport .",
    "in contrast , for dwp@xmath59  the dynamics is largely determined by defect - specific modes which effectively give rise to a much larger dipole moment .",
    "one may speculate that this is the reason why on average the potential barrier for dwp@xmath59  is much larger than that of dwp@xmath58 .",
    "a significant charge transport involves a major reorganization of the whole system which typically will be connected with a significant activation energy due to the dominant character of the coulomb energy .",
    "_ defect - free tls _ : as already mentioned above we find approx . @xmath70 tls / tetrahedron without defects .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xmath17 this translates into an effective density of tls @xmath71 , accessible from acoustic experiments , which within a factor of 3 agrees with the experimentally observed value for suprasil w.@xmath20    _ dipole moments _ : the dipole moment for tls@xmath58  is close to the experimental value , obtained for suprasil",
    "w.@xmath20 increasing the concentration of oh , i.e. using suprasil i , one obtains a second contribution with a dipole moment which is larger by nearly one order of magnitude.@xmath20 naturally , it has been related to the tunneling of the oh - impurities .",
    "interestingly , similar dipole moments are observed for tls@xmath60  and tls@xmath59 . since tls with such large dipole moments",
    "are absent in suprasil w one may conclude that tls@xmath59  do not play a major role .",
    "_ relevance of intrinsic defects _ : the previous conclusion can be directly checked by analyzing the estimated number of tls@xmath59 . it would be of the same size as the tls@xmath58  from the undistorted silica network if there exists at least one intrinsic defect per 200 sio@xmath12-tetrahedra ( please have in mind the uncertainty in the determination of the number of dwp@xmath59  and dwp@xmath60as discussed above ) .",
    "analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of silica , using the metabasin approach , suggests that around @xmath72 there is roughly 1 silicon defect per 300 tetrahedra ( data not shown ) .",
    "a different way of extrapolation for bks - data yields a significantly smaller fraction of defects.@xmath41 furthermore , density functional calculations in general lead to a smaller number of defects than using the bks - potential.@xmath73 to the best of our knowledge no definite experimental information is available for the number of defects in pure silica .",
    "thus , combining our results for the probability of generating tls@xmath59  with the ( somewhat uncertain ) absolute number of intrinsic defects , the numerical results are at least consistent with the experimentally observed absence of tls@xmath59(using the conclusion from above ) .",
    "_ relevance of extrinsic defects _ : the number of tls@xmath60  would be close to that of tls@xmath58  if there is one lithium ion per 125 tetrahedra . for suprasil i ( 1200 ppm oh - defects by weight ) one thus has one oh - molecule per 240 sio@xmath12-tetrahedra .",
    "experimentally it has been found via dielectric echo experiments@xmath20 as well as specific heat experiments@xmath74 that the number of extrinsic tls is half the number of intrinsic tls .",
    "thus an equal contribution of extrinsic and intrinsic tls would require one oh - molecule per 240/2=120 tetrahedra which is close to the value we obtained for an equal contribution of tls@xmath60  to tls@xmath58 .",
    "of course , this perfect agreement is to some extent accidental , given the different nature of lithium and oh - defects and the non - completeness of the search . in any event , the order of magnitude seems to be fully compatible .",
    "_ coupling to acoustic modes : _ it is estimated from experiments that the deformation potential is approx .",
    "40% smaller for extrinsic tls than for intrinsic tls ( more specifically , tls@xmath58 , according to the discussion above ) .",
    "this result is obtained , first , from the relaxation of electric echoes@xmath20 and , second , from the comparison of the specific heat and the thermal conductivity for suprasil i and suprasil w. the difference between both probes is much smaller for the thermal conductivity.@xmath75 it is known from theoretical considerations that the deformation potential scales with the average distance @xmath46.@xmath76 the different values of @xmath46 in tab.[dipole ] for tls@xmath60  as compared to tls@xmath58  suggest that indeed the deformation potential for extrinsic tls may be significantly smaller than for intrinsic tls .    in summary ,",
    "present - day computer simulations are able to reveal many microscopic properties of two - level systems in glasses in the kelvin regime and enable a quantitative comparison with experimental data . via the complementary information from theory and experiments",
    "a detailed knowledge about the underlying nature of tunneling systems becomes accessible .",
    "in particular the magnetic field dependence of polarization echo experiments may be promising to yield further insight about the microscopic nature of tls from the experimental side .@xmath77 in any case , based on the additional information from this type of simulations the tunneling systems need no longer be considered as phenomenological entities .",
    "we like to thank h. lammert , a. saksaengwijit and k. trachenko for fruitful discussions and the international graduate school of chemistry for funding .",
