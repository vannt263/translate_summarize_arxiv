    "as it follows from the israel theorem @xcite , the only static and asymptotically - flat vacuum space - time possessing a regular horizon is the schwarzschild solution .",
    "for all the other weyl exterior solutions @xcite , the physical components of the riemann tensor exhibit singularities at the infinite red shift surface . even though we shall restrict ourselves to the static case , it is worth noting that a result similar to israel theorem exists for stationary solutions with respect to the kerr metric @xcite .",
    "now , sphericity is a common assumption in the description of compact objects , where deviations from spherical symmetry are likely to be incidental rather than basic features of these systems .",
    "furthermore , if the field produced by a self  gravitating system is not particularly intense ( the boundary of the source is much larger than the infinite redshift surface ) and fluctuations off spherical symmetry are slight , then there is no problem in representing the corresponding deviations from spherical symmetry ( both inside and outside the source ) as a suitable perturbation of the spherically symmetric exact solution @xcite .",
    "however , as the object becomes more and more compact , such perturbative scheme will eventually fail close to the source .",
    "indeed , as is well known @xcite , though usually overlooked , as the boundary surface of the source approaches the infinite redshift surface , any finite perturbation of the schwarzschild spacetime , becomes fundamentally different from the corresponding exact solution representing the quasi ",
    "spherical spacetime , even if the latter is characterized by parameters whose values are arbitrarily close to those corresponding to schwarzschild metric .",
    "this in turn is just an expression of the israel theorem .    in other words , for strong gravitational fields",
    ", there exists a bifurcation between the perturbed schwarzschild metric and all the other weyl metrics ( in the case of gravitational perturbations ) , no matter how small are the multipole moments ( higher than monopole ) of the source .",
    "examples of such a bifurcation have been brought out in the study of the trajectories of test particles in the @xmath0 spacetime @xcite , and in the m - q spacetime @xcite , for orbits close to the infinite redshift surface @xcite,@xcite .",
    "due to the bifurcation mentioned above , a fundamental question arises : how should we describe the quasi ",
    "spherical space ",
    "time resulting from the fluctuations off schwarzschild ? :    * \\(a ) by means of a perturbed schwarzschild metric producing a black hole + or * \\(b ) by means of an exact solution to einstein equations , whose ( radiatable ) multipole moments are arbitrarily small , though non ",
    "vanishing , and leading to a naked singularity ?",
    "as we shall see here , the quandary above might be solved by comparing the behaviour of circular geodesics in either case .    indeed , in spite of some results obtained in the study of the source of quasi ",
    "spherical spacetimes @xcite , @xcite , which favor the scenario ( b ) , we are well aware of the fact that , presently , most researchers , favor scenario ( a ) .",
    "nevertheless , the doubt remains , and the very different behaviour of the system implied by the bifurcation mentioned above , opens the way for proposing observational scenarios allowing for distinguishing between black holes and naked singularities .",
    "in fact this issue has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however an important open question arises , related to the proposed approach , namely : since there are as many different ( physically distinguishable ) weyl solutions as there are different harmonic functions , which among weyl solutions is the best entitled to describe small deviations from spherical symmetry ?    in the past different authors have resorted to different metrics to describe deviations from spherical symmetry ; e.g. the @xmath0 metric or the m - q spacetime in @xcite , the young - coulter solution @xcite in @xcite , the quevedo - mashhoon solution @xcite in @xcite , or the manko - novikov solution @xcite in @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind the choice of the @xmath1-metric is based on the fact that it corresponds to a solution of the laplace equation ( in cylindrical coordinates ) with a singularity structure similar to that of the schwarzschild solution ( a line segment ) . in this sense",
    "the @xmath1-metric appears as a `` natural '' generalization of schwarzschild space - time to the axisymmetric case .    on the other hand , due to its relativistic multipole structure , the m",
    "q solution ( more exactly , a sub  class of this solution m - q@xmath2 @xcite ) may be interpreted as a quadrupole correction to the schwarzschild space  time , and therefore represents a good candidate among known weyl solutions , to describe small deviations from spherical symmetry",
    ".    however it should be obvious that the question above has not a unique answer ( there are an infinite number of ways of being non  spherical , so to speak ) and therefore in the study of any specific problem , the choice of the corresponding weyl spacetime has to be reasoned .    in this work",
    "we intend to use yet another exact solution of the weyl family , in order to describe deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "such a solution is the so called lm metric @xcite , its properties and the reasons behind its choice to describe a quasi ",
    "spherical spacetime are presented in the next section .",
    "next we shall calculate the circular geodesics in that spacetime an compare its behaviour with the spherically symmetric case .",
    "the most relevant result emerging from that analysis is the existence of stable innermost circular orbits very close to the ( singular ) horizon of the source , and inner than the one of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we shall carry out a study of circular geodesics in the spacetime of the lm spacetime .",
    "thus , we shall first very briefly revise such a metric and provide arguments justifying its use to describe quasi ",
    "spherical ( axially symmetric and static ) spacetime ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "finally we shall present the multipole structure of the solution .",
    "as is known , the line element of a static and axisymmetric vacuum space - time is represented in weyl form as follows @xmath3 \\ , \\label{weylds}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath0 are functions of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 alone .",
    "the metric function @xmath4 is a solution of the laplace s equation ( @xmath7 ) , and the other metric function @xmath0 satisfies a system of differential equations whose integrability condition is just the equation for the function @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the weyl family of solutions with a good asymptotical behaviour is given in associated spherical weyl coordinates @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the legendre polynomial .",
    "thus the line element now reads @xmath13    also , as is well known , in spite of the form of ( [ psi ] ) , coefficients @xmath14 are not the relativistic multipole moments ( rmm ) of the solution , as defined for static and axisymmetric vacuum solutions by geroch @xcite and thorne @xcite .",
    "however the `` newtonian '' moments @xmath14 , which provide the so called `` newtonian image '' of the solution , can be expressed as functions of the rmm @xcite .",
    "although the full relations linking both sets of coefficients are extremely complicated , they can be used to obtain relatively simple formulas for the coefficients @xmath15 in situations where the deviation of the relativistic solution from spherical symmetry is small .",
    "this issue has been discussed in some detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a solution of the weyl family that represents the exterior gravitational field of a mass distribution whose multipole structure only possesses mass @xmath16 and quadrupole moment @xmath17 was found in @xcite .",
    "this solution ( m - q ) has become a useful tool for describing small deviations from the spherically symmetric solution @xcite .",
    "the basic idea underlying the obtention of the @xmath16-@xmath17 solution is that @xmath17 is small since we want to describe slight deviations from the schwarzschild solution , and all the rmm of higher order are negligible .",
    "this assumption about the rmm higher than @xmath17 is supported by the following argument : the newtonian calculation of the multipole moments of an ellipsoidal mass distribution shows that as we move from lower to higher moments , their magnitudes decrease as powers of the eccentricity of the ellipsoidal configuration ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "then the m - q solution is constructed as a sum of functions in a power series of the dimensionless quadrupole parameter @xmath18 starting at the schwarzschild solution as the first order , in such a way that the successive powers of @xmath19 control the desired corrections to the spherical symmetry .",
    "the lm solution @xcite was constructed with the same purpose , namely : to describe the gravitational field of a body slightly different from a sphere .",
    "however the approach to find it , although similar , is different from the one used for the m - q solution . in both cases",
    ", it should be clear that , describing non  spherical spacetimes , their physical components of the riemann tensor exhibit singularities at the infinite redshift surface .",
    "the rationale behind the lm solution is the following : when attempting to describe an isolated compact body which is not spherically symmetric , all the rmm appear no matter how small is the deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , let us consider that all rmm appear in the solution that we want to construct but let us restrict their magnitudes to be very small , so that we can neglect all terms in the weyl coefficients whenever a cross product of rmm s is involved .",
    "this is the origin of the name of the family of solutions : _ linearized multipole _ ( lm ) solution .",
    "it should be observed that due to the linearity of the laplace equation , the so obtained solution is an exact solution to einstein equations .",
    "now , the expression for the metric function of the weyl family solution endowed with @xmath20 independent rmm , ( the @xmath21-solution ) , can be written , in prolate spheroidal coordinates @xcite , as follows @xmath22 , \\label{psilm}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are the coefficients appearing at the series expansion of any variable as a linear combination of legendre polynomials in that variable i.e. , @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 where the parameter @xmath26 denotes the dimensionless relativistic multipole moment of order @xmath27-pole ( @xmath28 ) , whereas the explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , since @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 , are :    @xmath34    the parameter @xmath35 can be calculated in terms of the coefficients @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37 \\ . \\label{masabolanu}\\ ] ]    in terms of its  newtonian image \" , the lm solution can be described by means of an `` object - image '' whose newtonian gravitational potential ( the gravitational potential corresponding to the newtonian image , not to confound with the weak field limit of the solution ) , as well as its newtonian multipole moments equal the metric function of the solution and the weyl coefficients respectively . that `` object - image '' is represented by a kind of `` dumbbell '' consisting of a bar of length @xmath38 with linear density @xmath39 given by an even polynomial of degree @xmath40 and two balls at each end of the bar with mass @xmath41 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the other metric function @xmath0 of the line element ( [ weylds ] ) can be obtained from the metric function @xmath4 by solving the corresponding field equations @xmath42 there already exists an expression for this metric function @xcite in terms of the weyl coefficients of the series @xmath4 ( [ psi ] ) , but it is highly complicated to handle and a summation of a series is required to obtain the analytic expression of the metric function .",
    "one advantage inherent to the dumbbell description of the solution consists of an integral expression ( @xcite ) for the metric function @xmath0 in terms of the density of the dumbbell :    @xmath43   \\ , \\ ] ]    or equivalently , @xmath44 \\ , \\ ] ] where the following notation is used @xmath45 , @xmath46 represents the density of the dumbbell and    @xmath47 } } \\nonumber \\\\                                                                                 & i_{\\pm } \\equiv { \\displaystyle \\int_{-1}^1dx \\frac{\\mu(x)}{r_{\\pm}r(x)\\left[r^2(1-\\omega^2)+(r\\omega - xm)(r\\omega\\pm m)+r_{\\pm}r(x)\\right ] } } \\nonumber \\\\ & a(r,\\omega)\\equiv { \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{4r_-^4}+\\frac{1}{4r_+^4}+\\frac{1}{r_-r_+\\left[r^2-m^2+r_+r_-\\right ] } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fact that the newtonian image of the lm solution is a dumbbell is quite convenient , since many properties of the solution can be described in terms of the density of the bar . thus for example , it can be shown that the source of the solution will be prolate ( oblate ) if @xmath39 is smaller ( greater ) than @xmath48 .",
    "also , as we shall see below , the possible existence of an isco , inner to the one correspondig to the spherically symmetric case is related to a condition on @xmath39 at the origin ( [ limite ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the rmm of a weyl solution can be calculated in terms of the coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "this relation can be inverted to obtain the newtonian moments ( @xmath14 ) in terms of the rmm .",
    "the assumption used to construct the lm solution is that every rmm is small , implying that we neglect all the terms with coupling interaction between rmm appearing in the weyl coefficients @xmath14 ( once again it should be emphasized that , due to the linearity of the laplace equation , the so obtained metric is an exact solution to einstein equations ) . with this selection of the coefficients",
    "we can consider that the solution possesses a finite number of parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 ) that represent each rmm of the solution .",
    "thus , the first rmm of the solution are the following ( odd moments are null because of the equatorial symmetry ) : @xmath52",
    "we shall now study the geodesic motion of test particles in the spacetime of the lm solution .",
    "we shall restric ourselves to the case of geodesics with constant @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. , those constrained to a constant hypersurface ( @xmath55 ) with coordinates @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we obtain on the equatorial plane the following expression ( see @xcite ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the affine parameter along the geodesic , @xmath59 is a constant and @xmath60 is an effective potential which can be obtained by integration as follows @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent the energy and angular momentum per unit mass respectively , and @xmath65 denotes the norm of the tangent vector to the geodesic @xmath66 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ ocho ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) we have that @xmath67 where @xmath68 .    the above equations , lead , for the line element ( [ weylds ] ) , to @xmath69 @xmath70 where the function @xmath71 for timelike geodesics on the equatorial plane is @xmath72    when looking for circular orbits we search for the stationary solutions of the autonomous partial differential equation ( [ geod ] ) , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "hence we can say that the circular orbits are defined by radial values @xmath74 where the following condition is satisfied : @xmath75 since the extremals of the effective potential satisfy ( prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath76 ) @xmath77    therefore , the circular orbits can be calculated by means of the function @xmath78 without using the second metric function @xmath0 since the complete effective potential is not needed .",
    "the timelike geodesics described by a pointlike particle around a circular orbit is defined by the zeros of both the function @xmath78 and its derivative .",
    "the orbit @xmath74 is stable ( @xmath79 ) if @xmath80 ( the minimum ) and it is unstable ( @xmath81 ) if @xmath82 ( the maximum ) . in the above it has been used that @xmath83 and hence @xmath84 observe that the specific energy of the geodesic orbit is @xmath85 , therefore , since @xmath86 , the parameter @xmath63 ( with @xmath87 or equivalently @xmath88 ) denotes , up to a sign , the energy per unit of mass of the test particle and it is fixed once the extremals ( @xmath89 ) of @xmath78 are determined : @xmath90.\\ ] ] also , observe that the conditions for circular orbits ( [ ffpri ] ) , ( [ ffpri2 ] ) determine the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 as follows : @xmath91 then , these parameters are constants of motion for each value of the radial coordinate @xmath74 . in what follows we shall consider the angular parameter as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath76 for different circular orbits and hence we introduce the notation @xmath92      for the forthcoming discussion , it would be convenient to recover the schwarzschild case , which is well known .",

    "we have a black hole whereas in the latter a naked singularity appears . our results , as well as those in the references already mentioned , point to a potentially observable evidence allowing to distinguish between the two above mentioned situations .",
    "we may summarize such results as follows :    * the presence of multipole moments ( higher than the monopole ) leads to the presence of isco s , closer to the infinite redshift surface than the ones existing in the exactly spherically symmetric case .",
    "* such multipole moments also produce an interval in the values of radial coordinate within which no stable circular orbits exist . * specific numerical values",
    "have been presented to illustrate the two abovementioned effects . *",
    "particularly relevant might be the application of the presented results to studying the dynamics of accretion discs around compact objects , which as it is well known , are assumed to be an essential ingredient of active sources such as @xmath169-ray binaries or galactic nuclei ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however such a study is out of the scope of this paper .",
