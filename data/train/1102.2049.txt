    ". these theoretical relations may be be useful in experiments and simulations to know the linear response of the system around ness .",
    "indeed the response can be obtaines from measurements entirely done at the unperturbed ness of the system of interest without any need to perform the actual perturbation .",

    "e.g. _ strongly fluctuating observables such as instantaneous velocities may lead to large statistical errors in the measurements @xcite .",
    "besides , ness quantities themselves such as local mean velocities , joint stationary densities and the stochastic entropy are not in general as easily measurable as dynamical observables directly related to the degrees of freedom @xcite .",
