    "the cgh , physically implemented using a spatial light modulator ( slm ) or similar technology , is illuminated by a monochromatic beam which is relayed to a focusing objective ; the desired intensity distribution is produced at the focal plane of the objective .",
    "cghs have been used in a wide range of technological applications and physical research .",
    "for example , soft matter and biological systems have been manipulated using dynamic arrays of focused beams ( i.e. , optical tweezers ) created using cghs ( see @xcite for a review ) , and cghs have been used to shape laser beams for inertial confinement fusion experiments @xcite .    although cgh technology has recently been applied to experiments involving ultra - cold atom gases , that work has been limited to arrays of optical dipole traps @xcite .",
    "new applications of optical dipole potentials for cold - atom research , such as interferometers @xcite and atom  transistors \" @xcite , may be realized if high - quality arbitrary light intensity profiles could be generated .",
    "the trapping potential for an atom confined in an optical dipole trap is proportional to the light intensity , and therefore the properties of the intensity profile created by a cgh are critical for such applications .",
    "desirable features of a cgh applied to trapping ultra - cold atoms include accuracy in matching the desired intensity profile , smoothness of the profile generated by the cgh , and efficiency in diffracting light into the target profile .",
    "smoothness , of particular importance for ultra - cold atom experiments , has received limited attention in previous work on cghs @xcite .",
    "disorder related to small - length - scale intensity fluctuations in an optical potential will introduce complications for interferometric applications @xcite and can greatly affect the study of quantum many - body physics ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "previous measures used to analyze the roughness of intensity profiles created using cghs could only be applied to uniform distributions ; in this manuscript , we introduce a new roughness metric appropriate for continuous profiles .",
    "some constraints related to cghs may be relaxed for ultra - cold atom applications  a cgh in this context is not required to control the intensity in the entire focal plane , since ultra - cold atom gases are typically confined to a finite region of space .    calculating a cgh to generate",
    "a high - quality arbitrary light intensity distribution is a challenging problem , because a cgh can not be directly computed , in general , from a desired arbitrary intensity profile .",
    "one technique for calculating a cgh when an exact solution is unknown is to use an iterative fourier transform algorithm ( ifta ) , which is computationally efficient compared with other methods , such as a direct binary search @xcite .",
    "an ifta predicts the propagation of a beam through an initial kinoform by fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and then successively modifies the kinoform based on a comparison between the predicted and desired focal plane intensities .",
    "the most frequently used iftas for calculating cghs are variants of the gerchburg - saxton ( gs ) and adaptive - additive ( aa ) algorithms @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a new ifta that we call the  mixed - region amplitude freedom \" ( mraf ) algorithm .",
    "the mraf algorithm typically improves by one order of magnitude on accuracy and and two orders of magnitude on roughness compared with the gs and aa algorithms for continuous target profiles . to our knowledge ,",
    "no algorithm for creating cghs with a comparable level of computational complexity surpasses the mraf algorithm in measures of accuracy and roughness .",
    "the mraf algorithm controls intensity in a bounded two - dimensional subset of the focal plane and achieves accuracy at the percent level at typically the cost of a factor of three in efficiency ( compared with the gs and aa algorithms ) . because the mraf algorithm controls the intensity profile in a single plane ,",
    "this method can only be applied to creating two - dimensional arbitrary optical traps ; confinement to the focal plane will require an additional tightly - focused sheet of light . in section [ algorithm ] of this manuscript the mraf algorithm is explained in detail , and in section [ results ] we report on the algorithm performance for six target intensity profiles .",
    "before giving the mathematical details of the mraf algorithm , we briefly review the operation of an ifta @xcite .",
    "an ifta is a technique to solve the following problem : design a cgh that will convert a light field @xmath1 at the cgh , or input plane , into a target intensity distribution @xmath2 at the focal , or output , plane of a focusing optic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1])@xcite .",
    "the light field @xmath3 is typically a gaussian beam apodized by the input aperture of the device used to implement the cgh .",
    "the ifta problem does not have a unique solution , as the complex phase of the optical field associated with @xmath4 is not constrained .",
    "this is known as phase freedom ; there is a choice of phase in the output plane @xcite .",
    "complete phase freedom is allowed for far - off resonance optical atom traps because the phase of the field in the output plane does not contribute to the trapping potential if the light is far - detuned from an electronic transition and if the dipole approximation is valid .",
    "an ifta is designed to use phase freedom to minimize the difference between @xmath4 and the intensity distribution produced by the cgh in the output plane .     in the input plane and @xmath5 in the output plane .",
    "the dashed lines represent the clear aperture of the focusing optics .",
    "the matrix used to computationally represent the input field must be enlarged beyond this region and filled with zero intensity points ( dark gray ) to fully resolve the output plane .",
    "the physical size of the matrix used to represent the input plane is @xmath6.,width=377 ]    an ifta can be decomposed into two parts as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : an initialization step and an iterative loop . in the initialization step ,",
    "a phase distribution @xmath7 is chosen as a starting point for the algorithm and is imprinted on @xmath3 to produce the input field @xmath8 for the first iteration .",
    "each iteration @xmath9 of the loop begins by calculating the field @xmath10 $ ] produced by @xmath11 propagating to the output plane .",
    "the propagation is modeled using a fourier transform @xmath12 , which assumes the paraxial approximation for the focusing optics @xcite .",
    "the algorithm then combines the propagated field @xmath13 with the target intensity profile @xmath4 to produce a new field @xmath14 .",
    "this procedure is carried out using one or more numerical scalars called mixing parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the phase of the backward propagated field @xmath16\\right]$ ] is used as the starting phase distribution for the next iteration .",
    "the iterative loop is terminated after @xmath17 iterations once a figure - of - merit @xmath18 , calculated using the intensity profile in the output plane and @xmath4 , does not improve with repeated iterations .",
    "the phase profile @xmath19 $ ] of the field in the input plane for the final iteration is the kinoform which must be transferred to a physical device .",
    "an ideally implemented cgh will produce the predicted intensity profile @xmath20 in the output plane .",
    "the goal of using an ifta to design a cgh is to choose mixing parameters that optimize one or more measures calculated on the predicted profile @xmath21 , such as the deviation from @xmath4 .",
    "achieving this goal will typically require executing an ifta multiple times with different selections of mixing parameters as part of an optimization scheme @xcite .",
    "central to the mraf algorithm is the introduction of amplitude freedom into a restricted region of the output plane and the use of a single mixing parameter .",
    "the mathematical details of the mraf algorithm are given in section [ projections ] .",
    "the use of amplitude freedom in the mraf algorithm is not sufficient to generate a high - quality optical field ",
    "a choice of initial phase that eliminates optical vortices from the output plane for all iterations is also necessary .",
    "we outline a procedure for choosing appropriate initial phase distributions in section [ phase ] .      at each step @xmath9 of the mraf algorithm ,",
    "the propagated field is combined with the target intensity distribution according to : @xmath22}.\\ ] ] a single mixing parameter @xmath15 controls the relative distribution of optical power in two subsets , the signal region ( @xmath23 ) and noise region ( @xmath24 ) , of the output plane . phase freedom is permitted everywhere in the output plane ( the phase of the propagated field is used for the phase of @xmath25 ) , while amplitude freedom is allowed only in the noise region .",
    "even though the mixing parameter @xmath15 is kept fixed , the fraction of power in each region changes for every iteration ; the only constraints imposed on the mraf algorithm are that the power in the target profile @xmath26 ( which is only non - zero in the @xmath23 ) and the total power in the output plane @xmath27 remain constant .",
    "the signal region is chosen to overlap with the area in which light will interact with atoms ; the remainder of the output plane is the noise region .",
    "the effect of dividing the output plane into subsets is to cause the algorithm to converge very closely to the target profile within the signal region , while behaving in a less controlled manner in the noise region .",
    "utilizing the amplitude freedom in the noise region allows for increased accuracy in matching @xmath4 in the signal region , while decreasing the efficiency of the cgh .",
    "the mraf algorithm is equivalent to a variable strength projection @xcite or regularized algorithm @xcite with a specific trajectory for the variable mixing parameter that has not been previously demonstrated .",
    "the mraf algorithm is also similar to the algorithm used in @xcite , but with a fixed @xmath15 .    in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we compare the performance of the mraf algorithm with the gs and aa algorithms . the gs algorithm , in which @xmath28}$ ] ,",
    "permits only phase freedom in the output plane . in the aa algorithm ,",
    "amplitude freedom is introduced uniformly into the output plane : @xmath29}$ ] .      as in any optimization scheme ,",
    "an initial guess that produces a result close to the target improves the convergence rate and reduces the risk of stagnation into a local optimization minimum . because iftas are used when the solution to the cgh problem is unknown , choosing an initial phase profile @xmath30 to reproduce complex features in @xmath4 is not possible .",
    "therefore , we wish to find a @xmath30 as our starting point for which most of the power in the output plane roughly overlaps with the envelope of @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution @xmath30 must also be chosen so that @xmath31 does not contain any undesired optical vortices ",
    "points characterized by a phase singularity and zero intensity  since an ifta is not able to eliminate vortices present in the output plane @xcite .",
    "a further constraint is that only certain choices for @xmath30 can prevent an ifta from _ producing _ optical vortices in the output plane at each iteration @xcite .",
    "the optical field in an ifta is discretized and the fourier transforms are calculated using ffts . in order for the fft to fully resolve the output plane and to reproduce the aperture of the physical device used to implement the cgh , the matrix representing the optical field must be enlarged ( i.e. ,  padded \" ) beyond the size of the cgh by adding a zero - intensity region @xcite .",
    "the truncation of the input plane field caused by padding leads iftas to create optical vortices in the output plane ; this behavior is not completely understood @xcite .",
    "we find that a quadratic phase distribution for @xmath30 combined with linear and conical gradients does not introduce optical vortices for the mraf algorithm , even through the input field is truncated in each iteration of the ifta .",
