    "the galactic bulge is the nearest example of a bulge / spheroidal population . a factor of 100 closer than m31 , the proximity of the bulge not only permits detailed measurement of stellar abundances and radial velocities , but also of stellar proper motions .",
    "the first such study undertaken ( at the suggestion rmr ) was that of @xcite .",
    "the proper motions were measured from plates obtained at the 200-inch prime focus in 1950 and 1983 ; these data produced measurable proper motions on the order of @xmath6 .",
    "the @xcite study was the source of an input catalog for a subsequent study of bulge radial velocity and low resolution abundances @xcite .",
    "an early study of the abundances and kinematics of these stars , using published abundances from @xcite and radial velocities from @xcite was undertaken by @xcite .",
    "that study suffered from having a relatively small sample size , and the lack of a definitive bulge iron abundance scale ; nonetheless the most metal rich subset of stars exhibited a vertex deviation of the velocity ellipsoid in the plot of radial versus transverse velocity .",
    "modeling by @xcite showed that such a vertex deviation , or rotation of the major axis of the velocity ellipsoid , is a feature expected from the long axis orbits that would support a bar structure .",
    "such a bar had been claimed by @xcite based on asymmetries in surface photometry of the bulge region , and by @xcite from the kinematics of molecular gas .",
    "the possibility of a dominant stellar bar population was strengthened by the spectacular results from the _ cobe _ satellite @xcite .",
    "all - sky maps of the milky way showed an asymmetry that was consistent with a bar , with major axis in the first quandrant .",
    "many subsequent studies confirm the presence of a bar structure based on deprojecting the spatial distribution of the stellar population @xcite and the schwarzschild method has been used to build a self consistent rapidly rotating bar @xcite .    here",
    "we combine the proper motions of @xcite , the abundances of @xcite , and the radial velocities of @xcite to explore the correlation of abundances and kinematics in the bulge stellar population .",
    "surveys now in progress @xcite have achieved total numbers of order @xmath7 stars . however , the sample of 315 stars on which we report here is at present the largest that has proper motions , radial velocities , and spectroscopically estimated abundances .    in exploring correlations of abundances and kinematics ,",
    "our aim is to constrain models for the origin of the bulge and bar .",
    "when the composition of bulge stars @xcite is considered , it can be argued that the bulge formed early and rapidly @xcite .",
    "@xcite isolated the old bulge population by proper motion , and @xcite demonstrated a comparison with a 13 gyr old main sequence turnoff population ; these studies find little room for a detectable trace young population in the bulge .",
    "however , there are complicating issues in the chemical evolution .",
    "mg is found to be elevated in bulge stars , while o is only mildly so @xcite and the `` explosive alphas '' ca , si , and ti are also less enhanced than mg , tracking the thick disk trends with [ fe / h ] .",
    "finally , the bar poses a problem for early formation and enrichment , as the longevity of bars is an issue .",
    "if the metals in the bulge were built early and rapidly , how and when did the bar appear and why has it survived ?",
    "correlating abundances and kinematics gives another viewpoint on chemical evolution .",
    "even if the abundance distribution appears to fit the closed box model and the population is old , the correlation of abundances and kinematics may reveal distinct kinematic subgroups . adding two proper motion vectors to the radial velocity increases the power of this analysis .",
    "there have been indications of abundance / kinematics correlations in the bulge .",
    "@xcite found that the most metal rich stars have a smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite found a similar trend in their small sample .",
    "@xcite found evidence for vertex deviation in the most metal rich stars . in a radial velocity study of a large number of bulge m giants , @xcite found indications for a smaller velocity dispersion for a metal rich subgroup of stars . @xcite",
    "obtained spectroscopy in a bulge field at ( l , b)=(8,7 ) and found differing kinematics ( more rotation support and a colder velocity dispersion ) for stars with @xmath2>-1 $ ] . in this paper , we explore abundance / kinematics correlations using both the radial velocity and proper motion data , and abundances from low resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we use the new iron abundance scale of @xcite to recalibrate the @xcite low resolution abundances ( those being based on the average of the fe 5270 and 5335 features in the spectra ) .",
    "while the derived abundance for any individual star is uncertain to roughly @xmath8 dex , the calibration ensures that the kinematic transitions we report here are tied to the best currently available iron abundance scale .",
    "the most metal rich stars in @xcite have formal metallicities in excess of 1 dex ; we do not take those values seriously , as they are transformed from outliers .    in this _",
    "we describe our kinematic analysis of the sample of 315 red giants .",
    "in an axisymmetric potential , one of the axes of the velocity dispersion tensor of an equilibrium population must lie in the meridional plane .",
    "any deviation from this situation indicates a non - axisymmetry , or a time variation . we will use the space velocities of our stars to measure the orientation of the axis of the velocity dispersion tensor in the radial - longitudinal velocity plane ( known as the _ vertex deviation @xmath9 _ ) and determine",
    "whether it is consistent with zero .",
    "the angle @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the covariance and standard deviation of the measured velocity components along the @xmath14 ( line of sight ) and @xmath15 ( galactic longitude ) directions .",
    "we measure the dispersions with an iterative clipping algorithm , by repeatedly rejecting stars that lie outside the ellipse with principal axes of 2.5 times the corresponding measured dispersion .",
    "table  [ tab : veldisp ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] summarize the velocity ellipsoid parameters found , both for the full sample and for metal poor and metal rich subsets .",
    "for each subsample we have calculated the spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath16 and its significance .",
    "l c c c c c c c c [ fe / h ] & @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath5 & @xmath9 & @xmath17 & n ( n@xmath18 ) & prob @xmath17 + & & deg & & & % + all & 109 & 94 & 86 & -25 & -0.15 & 315(21 ) & 0.85 + @xmath19 - 0.5 & 108 & 85 & 94 & 28 & + 0.09 & 77(11 ) & 39 + @xmath20 - 0.5 & 107 & 96 & 83 & -30 & -0.23 & 238(11 ) & 0.02 +               the most significant vertex deviation is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : veldisp ] for the metal rich sample ( @xmath2>-0.5 $ ] ) , whereas metal poor stars show no significant deviation .",
    "this result is consistent with the results from @xcite , based on @xmath21 of the present sample , and proves the reliability of their results ( zhao et al",
    ".  also saw a vertex deviation in the metal - poor sample , of opposite sign to the metal - rich set : with the addition of the new stars in this study the significance of this deviation has dropped ) .",
    "this difference between metal rich and metal poor stars is a strong stellar - dynamical demonstration of the existence of a stellar bar in the galactic center @xcite , and suggests that much of the disk takes part in it .",
    "[ fig : abunkin ] shows the velocity dispersion components and vertex deviation as a function of the metallicity , using a running mean over metallicity bins of width 0.4dex .",
    "the figure clearly shows a rather sharp transition near @xmath2=-0.5 $ ] : more metal - poor stars show little or no deviation , whereas the more metal - rich stars velocity ellipsoid is misaligned by about @xmath22 , with a rank correlation between radial and longitudinal velocity components for these stars that is significant at the 99% level .",
    "a further indication of this change in kinematic properties is the dispersion in the ( completely independent ) vertical velocity component , @xmath5 , which shows a clear break at @xmath2=-0.5 $ ] with the more metal - poor stars @xmath23 velocity dispersion being higher .",
    "we have also examined the correlations between the @xmath23 velocity and the other components , but found no significant deviation of the velocity ellipsoids out of the plane .",
    "the giant stars thus consist of a metal - rich population with a significant vertex deviation of @xmath24 degrees , and a metal - poor population that has no significant deviation , and hotter kinematics .",
    "the general trend of the bulge to have this vertex deviation is also seen in three minor axis fields with proper motions from hst imaging with wfpc2 ( soto et al .",
    "2007 in prep . ) .",
    "these fields were observed for radial velocities using the integral field spectrograph on vimos at vlt .",
    "the combination of radial velocities and @xmath15 proper motions yields an observable vertex deviation in the fields ( in samples not segregated by metallicity ) .",
    "our observations support the presence of a striking transition in the kinematics of the bulge , from an apparently isotropic oblate spheroid to a bar , at @xmath2=-0.5 $ ] .",
    "we have used a non - parametric rank correlation statistic to determine that the significance of the vertex deviation for the metal - rich stars is @xmath3% .",
    "there is a corresponding but shallower trend toward lower vertical velocity dispersion @xmath25 at higher abundance .",
    "it is difficult to imagine how a system with such a kinematic transition could be considered to have evolved in a one - zone chemical evolution scenario .",
    "do abundance trends of any other elements show a transition at @xmath26=-0.5 $ ] ? examining the trends given in @xcite and @xcite , we find no break in the trends of mg , o , ca , si , ti , na , and [ al / fe ] with [ fe / h ] that would correspond to @xmath27 dex . @xcite consider the trend of the explosive alpha elements @xmath28 with [ fe / h ] .",
    "they find that even to the lower limit of bulge [ fe / h ] , at @xmath2<-0.5 $ ] , the bulge trend of @xmath29 $ ] lies above the locus of halo and thick disk stars .",
    "hence , the stars with @xmath2<-0.5 $ ] can not be considered simply to belong to the halo or thick disk .",
    "similarly , virtually all stars with @xmath2>-0.5 $ ] have strongly enhanced mg , a strong indication that the chemistry reflects a history of rapid enrichment that extends through the boundary of this kinematic transition .    in order to form the bar via a stellar - dynamical instability , which then thickens into a bulge @xcite",
    ", the stars would already have to have been in place .",
    "the kinematics thus suggest a scenario in which all stars with @xmath2>-0.5 $ ] stars were formed in a disk _ before _ the bar instability occurred ; the more metal - poor stars are then a population unrelated to the disk , bar and bulge , consistent with their hotter kinematics .",
    "but the continuity in bulge abundance trends across @xmath2=-0.5 $ ] argues against the existence of two entirely separate populations with different chemical evolution histories .",
    "evidently the situation is more complicated than a simple few - component model can describe .",
    "it is clearly important to explore the existence of these trends in larger samples and in additional fields in the bulge .",
