    "studies of globular cluster ( gc ) systems play a critical role in our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "until two decades ago it was thought that all gcs were old , and this shaped our view of how galaxies , especially elliptical galaxies , formed ( see @xcite ) . imaging with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ then revealed that young compact star clusters form copiously in galaxy mergers @xcite , a fact that supports theories in which giant elliptical galaxies are formed through mergers of spirals @xcite .    however , the formation and evolution of gc systems is still not well understood .",
    "we should be able to observe how gc systems evolve from the very young systems with power - law luminosity functions into old systems with log - normal luminosity functions , such as are observed in typical elliptical galaxies .",
    "these observations would greatly clarify exactly which processes ( shocking , evaporation , dynamical friction ; e.g. , @xcite ) are important in the evolution of star cluster systems .",
    "finding intermediate - age gc populations in elliptical galaxies has been difficult .",
    "spectroscopy is often thought to be a relatively accurate method for measuring cluster ages and metallicities .",
    "however , in practice spectroscopy is very time consuming , even for 8m - class telescopes , leaving only the brightest gcs open to such analyses .",
    "@xcite spent 9.3 hours observing nine gc candidates in the e5 galaxy ngc  3610 with keck , and found only one young gc .",
    "the majority of candidate gcs in galaxies identified via morphology and color to be intermediate - age merger remnants are too faint for spectroscopic study .",
    "photometric studies have also had limited success , partly because most have been done only at optical wavelengths ( specifically , in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 passbands ) .",
    "the problem is that the  colors of metal - rich gcs with ages of 13 gyr overlap with the colors of @xmath013 gyr old metal - poor gcs , resulting in an age - metallicity degeneracy ( * ? ? ?",
    "fortunately , the combination of optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry can break this age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this is because optical - to - nir indices are sensitive to metallicity , but only weakly dependent on age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "physically this works because in older stellar populations the @xmath1-band predominantly samples the light of stars near the turn - off , while the -band is more sensitive to cooler stars on the giant branch .",
    "the color of the giant branch is metallicity - dependent , so the index  is primarily a metallicity indicator .",
    "thus , we can lift the age  metallicity degeneracy by plotting the locations of simple stellar populations ( ssp ) in a color  color diagram , specifically  vs.  .",
    "the four early - type galaxies ngc  1700 , ngc  2865 , ngc  4382 , and ngc  7727 were selected based on their tidal fine - structure content , blue @xmath3 colors , and enhanced balmer absorption lines @xcite . the sample spans the morphology and age gap between on - going mergers and normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "ngc  4382 is similar to the merger remnants ngc  7252 , ngc  3921 , and ngc  7727 , but lacks tidal tails .",
    "its rich fine structure and distortions ( see fig .  1 in @xcite and fig",
    ".  9 in @xcite ) suggest that it experienced a merger 12 gyr ago , a hypothesis strengthened by its still bluish center @xcite , double - peaked nucleus @xcite , and counter - rotating core @xcite .",
    "it was selected specifically to bridge the age gap between ongoing mergers like ngc  4038/39 or ngc  3256 and normal old ellipticals .",
    "the elliptical galaxies ngc  1700 and ngc  2865 both show evidence for recent interactions or mergers and are therefore candidate `` young ellipticals . ''",
    "ngc  1700 features boxy isophotes , a strong isophotal twist , and two broad arms or tails that have long suggested it may be the remnant of a major merger of two disk galaxies ( @xcite , esp .",
    "1b ; @xcite ) .",
    "its kinematics supports this hypothesis : it rotates fast @xcite , yet features a counterrotating core with a distinctly younger stellar population @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that its gcs are consistent with an age of @xmath44 gyr , but do not necessarily form a population of obviously intermediate age .",
    "ngc  2865 features bright irregular shells , a luminous plume of material , and a faint outer loop , all suggesting that it is the remnant of a relatively recent merger ( see fig .  5 of @xcite and fig .  1 of @xcite )",
    "this hypothesis is supported by gas fragments associated with the optical fine structure @xcite , a rapidly rotating small central core with a younger stellar population and gas @xcite , and a body with unusually blue  colors .",
    "@xcite note that in a color histogram the galaxy s gcs seem to contain a subpopulation bluer than normal metal - poor gcs and , hence , likely of much younger age ( @xmath40.51 gyr ) .    finally , ngc  7727 (= vv67 = arp 222 ) is so obviously tidally disturbed that it was included by both @xcite and @xcite in their catalogs of interacting galaxies . because of its spiral - shaped tidal tails it was originally classified as a peculiar sa galaxy @xcite , but was then reclassified as a recent merger remnant of age @xmath41.3 gyr by @xcite .",
    "the presence of bluish young star clusters in it was noted by @xcite and described in some more detail by @xcite .",
    "we obtained -band images of the above four early - type galaxies with the near - infrared imager and spectrometer ( niri ) on gemini north @xcite and with flamingos -",
    "i on gemini south @xcite , with the results shown in figure  [ fig : ngc ] .",

    "all four galaxies were also observed with _ hst _ in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( go-7468 , pi : schweizer ) , and we used unpublished photometry from that project . in the case of ngc  4382 , we used the most recent photometric data published by @xcite .",

    "normalized flats were constructed from images taken with the gemini calibration unit .",
    "flat - field images with the ir lamp on and off allowed separation of the instrumental thermal signature from the sensitivity response .",
    "the near - ir sky level and structure varies on time scales of a few minutes . to account for such variations we used a dither pattern in our imaging sequences , which provided blank fields close enough in time to derive the sky levels reliably .",
    "some of the niri frames contain an electronic pattern visible as vertical striping with a period of eight columns and not always present in all quadrants . before including the affected frames in our image processing list we used the stand - alone python routine _",
    "nirinoise.py _ which almost perfectly removed the striping .",
    "the same image reduction steps were applied to the standard star observations as well .    all reduced science and standard star exposures of the corresponding nights were registered to a common coordinate system with the task _ imcoadd _ , based on geometric solutions obtained with the task _ geomap _ for niri .",
    "the final  science image for each galaxy was derived by averaging individual images , scaled to the galaxy image from the most photometric night , with the iraf task _",
    "to detect as many gcs as possible from our -band images and match them with existing _ hst",
    "_ photometry , we first created a model image of each galaxy with the tasks _ ellipse _ and _ bmodel _ of the _ isophote _ package in iraf .",
    "this model image was then subtracted from the original combined galaxy image .",
    "this procedure facilitated the uniform detection of point sources at a detection threshold of 3@xmath10 above the background , using the task _ daofind _ of the _ daophot _ package .",
    "figure  [ fig : technique ] shows an example of this technique .",
    "the photometry of the candidate gcs in our sample of merger remnants was calibrated to  on the standard system via 14-aperture photometry matching that used in the 2mass survey .",
    "this method was chosen because the standard stars observed with gemini indicated significant variability in the zero point during our observations .",
    "the conditions that these galaxies were observed under were iq70 and , therefore , not guaranteed to be photometric .",
    "the flamingos - i observations , on the other hand , showed a high level of agreement with the calibration via the 2mass stars ; coincidently , this night had very good photometric conditions .",
    "we matched the optical _ hst _ observations ( already reduced and calibrated ) with our infrared gc candidates using the iraf tasks _ geomap _ and _ geotran_. the brightest common objects in both images served as points of reference .",
    "the initial selection of gc candidates was largely based on applying color limits to the objects identified in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and  images .",
    "however , it was expected that this method alone would prove insufficient to remove contaminants such as background galaxies and foreground stars . therefore , the photometric completeness of the data was determined , and a visual inspection of each gc candidate was performed .    since this study utilized space - based @xmath1 and @xmath2 images , but ground - based  images , it was expected that the  images would set the completeness limit for the photometric data .",
    "hence , a set of completeness curves were generated from the  images obtained with niri and flamingos - i for each galaxy .",
    "these curves were created through the addition of artificial cluster images to each galaxy image , using the daophot task _",
    "addstar_. for each of the galaxies ngc  1700 , ngc  2865 , and ngc  7727 , 100,000 artificial cluster images ranging from 15 to 25 magnitudes were added , with no more than 100 clusters added to any one image to prevent overcrowding . in the case of ngc  4382 , which exhibits an already relatively crowded field of point sources ,",
    "only 50 artificial clusters were added to each image , effectively halving the total number of artificial clusters studied .",
    "the daophot tasks _ daofind _ and _ phot _ were then used to attempt to recover these artificial clusters , and to perform photometry on them .",
    "this process was repeated for background values of 25 , 65 , 85 , 125 , and 250 counts per pixel .",
    "this process allowed us to generate two kinds of completeness curves for the gcs of each galaxy .",
    "curves of the first kind represented the fraction of artificial clusters that were successfully recovered by the task _",
    "daofind_. completeness curves of the second kind represented the fraction of artificial clusters that were not only successfully recovered by _ daofind _ , but that also returned a photometric magnitude within acceptable limits via the task _",
    "phot_. there were two of these limits : the returned photometric magnitude was required to have an error of @xmath110.3 mag and was also required to be within 0.5 mag of the magnitude of the input artificial - cluster image .",
    "a smoothed curve based on the completeness function given in @xcite was fit to each set of completeness curves generated .",
    "the two parameters returned by this fitting procedure were the 50% completeness limit ,  ( expressed in magnitudes ) , and a steepness parameter @xmath12 .",
    "table  [ tablecplte ] presents for each galaxy and background value the two fit parameters derived , both for the first kind of completeness curves ( subscript `` fnd '' for `` found '' ) and for the second kind ( subscript `` acc '' for `` accepted '' ) .",
    "as mentioned above , several completeness curves were generated for each galaxy in order to determine the stability of the photometric completeness limit over a range of background values . given that the background varied considerably over any one image , particularly across the center of the galaxy , such stability was essential .",
    "indeed , the variance in background over each image considerably affected the point - spread functions ( psfs ) that we attempted to construct . in order to negate this effect , the final psfs that were used in the artificial cluster addition",
    "were generated from background - subtracted gc images , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : psf ] .",
    "these background - subtracted gc images were created using a @xmath13-pixel median subtraction .",
    "for each panel.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    > from the results presented in table  [ tablecplte ] it is evident that  although the steepness of the completeness curves did vary ",
    "the 50% completeness limit was exceptionally stable over the range of background values investigated .",
    "therefore , we were able to use a single completeness limit for each image , despite the fact that the background values varied dramatically across the cores of the galaxies",
    ".      figure  [ fig : ngc1700c ] shows the completeness curve derived for gcs in ngc  1700 ( shown for accepted artificial clusters only ) . as table  [ tablecplte ]",
    "details , the 50%  completeness limits were @xmath1421.91 for both the recovered and the accepted clusters at all background levels . hence , it is evident that photometric errors do not play a significant role in setting the depth of completeness in this case .",
    "rather , the completeness is limited primarily by our ability to detect the clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : ngc2865c ] shows the completeness curve derived for gcs in ngc  2865 . in this galaxy , the 50% completeness limits were @xmath1521.52 for both the recovered and the accepted artificial clusters . as in the case of ngc  1700 , the very small range of these values indicates that the completeness in  was limited by our ability to detect the clusters rather than by photometric errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : ngc4382c ] shows the completeness curve derived for gcs in ngc  4382 .",
    "again , the  50% completeness limits are similar for the recovered and accepted curves , though with wider scatter than in ngc  1700 and ngc  2865 and with a 0.06 mag difference between the two mean values ( see table  [ tablecplte ] ) .",

    "details , the various  50% completeness limits scatter more and show a significant systematic difference of 0.09 mag between the recovered artificial clusters ( mean @xmath16 ) and the accepted clusters ( mean @xmath17 ) . notice that these limits for the ngc  7727 gcs are more than 0.5 mag fainter than the limits for gcs in the other three galaxies , which is not surprising given that the  images of ngc  7727 were obtained with flamingos -",
    "i on a night of particularly good seeing .",
    "it is because of these fainter limits that the photometric errors are more influential in ngc  7727 than in the other three galaxies .",

    "in order to constrain the age of the merger event for each of the four galaxies , the ages of their gc subpopulations were determined .",

    "new -band photometry of the gcs in these galaxies has been obtained with two near - infrared imagers on gemini and combined with existing _ hst _ photometry in @xmath1 and @xmath2 to produce color  color and color  magnitude diagrams of the gc systems in .",
    "these data have been fitted to simple toy models of mixed gc populations containing three subpopulations that differ in age and metallicity .",
    "the mixed gc populations have been simulated with ssp models by charlot & bruzual ( 2007 , private communication ) and compared to the observations .",
    "various  fits to the cumulative age distributions derived from our data and from the toy models yield clear evidence for the presence of intermediate - age , metal - rich subpopulations of gcs in each of the four early - type galaxies . at the observed , relatively bright  magnitudes these intermediate - age subpopulations exceed the old metal - rich and metal - poor subpopulations in cluster numbers , and their estimated ages of @xmath012 gyr are consistent with published ages for the same galaxies based on the integrated light .",
