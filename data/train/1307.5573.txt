    "recently , we have proposed that the abe homotopy group @xmath34  @xcite provides a mathematical framework for simultaneously classifying a vortex and a topological excitation with dimensionality @xmath35 .",
    "this group naturally includes the topological influence in its group structure . in condensed matter systems ,",

    "first , we discuss the topological influence on a non - abelian vortex . as a concrete example , let us consider a biaxial nematic phase in a liquid crystal .",
    "an order parameter of the liquid crystal is described by a real traceless symmetric tensor @xmath37 .",

    "the topological charge @xmath57 changes as @xmath64 according to the definition of the eight - element quaternion group , @xmath57 and @xmath65 are different topological charges .",
    "thus , a topological charge of a vortex can transform to an other topological charge by making a complete circuit around a different vortex .",
    "in other words , the non - abelian charge is not uniquely determined up to conjugation .",
    "this ambiguity is a well - known property in the classification of vortices @xcite .",

    "in this section , we discuss the issues concerning the definition of the total charge and the measurement of topological charges .",

    "the representative examples are superfluid @xmath14he and scalar becs ( fully polarized spinor becs ) , in which the order parameter manifold is given by @xmath15 . since @xmath16 , it is possible to observe the winding number of the vortices individually .",
    "however , if the homotopy group is non - abelian , the counting of individual defects breaks down due to the influence of the coexisting defects . in this case , the topological charge is determined up to the conjugacy class of the homotopy group .",
    "thus , the sum of each individual topological charge is insufficient to define the total charge .",
    "nevertheless , in the closed system , the total charge would be defined by encoding the values of the order parameter on the boundary of the system , which remains unchanged under the adiabatic manipulation .",
    "thus , the total charge is measurable by probing the system boundary without regard to the topological influence .",
    "next , we state the detection of each individual topological charge in the topological charge conserving framework .",
    "we suggest that we could determine individual topological charges through the testing of pair annihilation .",
    "for example , let us consider the system with a vortex v@xmath62 .",
    "assuming that we can create a vortex - antivortex pair and manipulate vortices adiabatically , we create the vortex - antivortex pair : v@xmath61 and v@xmath61 near the vortex v@xmath62 , and then we rotate the vortex v@xmath61 about the vortex v@xmath62 adiabatically in the clockwise direction . finally , we fuse the vortex v@xmath61 into the remaining antivortex v@xmath61. the combined charge of v@xmath61 and v@xmath61 turns out to be given by a commutator . as a result",
    ", this test is categorized into three cases : ( 1 ) the vortex pair annihilates each other .",
    "hence , each topological charge is abelian and we can observe the topological charge individually . ( 2 ) the vortex pair survives and its charge belongs to the abelian group .",
    "then , the vortices v@xmath62 and v@xmath61 are not observable individually , but each individual commutator is observable .",
    "thus , a relative charge of v@xmath62 and v@xmath61 is possible to detect through the commutator .",
    "( 3 ) the vortex pair survives and its charge belongs to the non - abelian group . in this case",
    ", it is also possible to determine the topological charge uniquely if we have only two types of the vortex .",
    "however , if there are more than two , we can not determine the topological charge uniquely due to the influence between commutators .",
    "namely , we can detect the charge of vortex - antivortex pair up to the conjugacy class .",
    "fortunately , for the real system tabulated at table  [ tab : core ] , the commutator subgroup is abelian except for the cyclic phase in the spin-2 becs .",
    "thus , almost all ordered phases are categorized into the case ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . in the cyclic phase ,",
    "the commutator subgroup is isomorphic to the eight - element quaternion group .",
    "namely , this phase belongs to the case ( 3 ) .    as a concrete example , if we consider non - abelian vortices in the spinor becs , the total charge would be estimated by analyzing the spatial variations of the order parameter at the boundary through a stern - gerlach separation , in which the populations in each magnetic sublevel can be measured  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , each individual topological defect is determined up to the conjugacy class due to the topological influence . to observe the topological charge in the charge conserving scheme",
    ", it is necessary to apply the pair annihilation testing to individual topological defects .",
    "however , such manipulation of the topological defects has yet to be achieved in the experiment of spinor becs .",
    "in the present paper , we have discussed the relation between the topological charge conservation and the topological influence . to ensure the consistency with the charge conservation , we have introduced the topological back - action , and shown that the topological back - action causes twisting of a vortex line for the point - defect case .",
    "the twist of a vortex corresponds to two hqv rings ( alice rings ) attached on two edges of a vortex line , whose topological charge is characterized by @xmath141 .",
    "this idea might be generalized to higher - dimensional cases ( @xmath290 ) , in which a dimension of a vortex is @xmath291 , where @xmath9 is the space dimension .",
    "thus , a surface enclosing a vortex is given by @xmath292 , where @xmath293 .",
    "here , @xmath294 includes the degrees of freedom to encircle the vortex core and we assume that each edge has the same configuration .",
    "the topological back - action from a point defect in a @xmath9-dimensional space is given by the homotopy equivalence classes of @xmath294 ; i.e. @xmath295 where @xmath296 describes a topological charge of a point defect in the @xmath9-dimensional space .",

    "we have calculated commutators and determined the classifications of the charge transfer for the non - abelian vortices : one type for the bn phase , three types for the spin-2 biaxial nematic phase , and seven types for the cyclic phase .",
    "in particular , we have found non - abelian charge transfer in the cyclic phase , which may lead to new topological phenomena .",
    "it would be worthwhile to mention that the commutator between @xmath31 and @xmath30 represents the whitehead bracket @xcite , which suggests a new direction of this study .    in higher - dimensional cases , the un phase , the spin-1 polar phase , the spin-2 uniaxial phase , and the superfluid @xmath29he - a phase",
    "show the charge transfer classified by an even integer due to the topological influence of the hqv ( disclination ) .",
    "this charge transfer depends mainly on a set of the automorphism maps @xmath27 .",
    "also , if we consider the action of @xmath31 on @xmath30 to be a homomorphism from @xmath31 to @xmath298 , then we can rule out topological influence in a number of different cases on group - theoretic grounds .",
    "in particular ,",
    "when @xmath299 , @xmath300 is always @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we can have only the @xmath100-action on the point defect .",
    "for example , in the case of the dipole - free @xmath29he - a phase , @xmath301 and @xmath302 , and the @xmath31 action on @xmath97 is nontrivial  @xcite . for @xmath303",
    ", if we consider the homomorphism map from @xmath242 into @xmath304 , the only such homomorphism takes @xmath305 to an identity map .",
    "thus , @xmath306 and @xmath305 will not cause any effect , while @xmath307 and @xmath308 will .",
    "also , we have suggested that the pair annihilation testing enables us to detect the topological charge in the charge conservation framework .",
    "this testing is applicable to the higher dimensional cases and is useful for detecting evidence of the nature of non - abelian charge .    in this paper , we have focused on the role of the charge conservation in a multiple topological excitation system .",
