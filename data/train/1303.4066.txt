    "t tauri stars are young ( @xmath0 years ) , low - mass ( @xmath1 ) stars at the stage of gravitational contraction toward the main sequence . from the observational point of view , they are late - type subgiants with emission lines of hydrogen and caii , as well as of some other atoms and ions , mostly with relatively low ionization potentials .",
    "t tauri stars are also characterized by excess continuum emission at short visible wavelengths and in the infrared compared to main - sequence stars of the same spectral types ( see the reviews [ 1 , 2 ] ) .",
    "the variety and relative intensities of their emission - line spectra , as well as their continuum excesses , correlate with the equivalent width of the @xmath2 line ; thus , we may consider this line to be an indicator of the activity of low - mass young stars .",
    "it is accepted to call stars with @xmath3  classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , and precisely such stars will be the subject of our studies below .",
    "infrared and radio investigations of cttss testify that these stars are surrounded by disklike gas - dust envelopes .",
    "iue observations of cttss show the presence of lines of highly ionized atoms , up to nv ; the luminosity in these lines is several orders of magnitude higher than for the corresponding solar lines [ 3 ] . however , at x - ray energies , between 0.5 and 4.5 kev , cttss have luminosities @xmath4 erg / s , i.e. , 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than expected by analogy with the sun based on the observed intensities of , e.g. , the civ @xmath51550 line .",
    "the absence of forbidden fex @xmath56375 and fexiv @xmath55303 coronal lines in the spectra of cttss suggests that this is not associated with the absorption of x - rays in the extended circumstellar envelopes , but rather is due to a real difference of the observed @xmath6 ratio from the solar ratio .",
    "the comparatively hard spectrum @xmath7  k ) and variability of the observed x - ray emission suggest that it is associated with flare activity [ 2 , 4 ] .",
    "there is not yet any consensus about the nature of the regions in which the ctts emission - line spectrum forms , nor about the origin of the rather strong outflows of matter from the vicinitiy of cttss in the form of so - called co flows and jets .",
    "up until the early 1980s , it was thought that the activity of cttss was the result of powerful chromospheres and/or coronae , to some extent similar to the corresponding solar structures , and that the reason for the existence of hot layers above the photosphere and of the stellar wind was the dissipation of mechanical energy generated by the stellar convective zone [ 5 - 9 ] .",
    "later , it was proposed that the emission - line spectrum was associated with heating of material from the disklike circumstellar envelope falling onto the young star .",
    "if the inner edge of the disk is in contact with the stellar surface , the heating should take place in a boundary layer , where the disk material is decelerated from the keplerian velocity to the stellar rotation velocity [ 10 , 11 ] .",
    "however , if the young star has a fairly powerful dipolar magnetic field , then , by analogy with x - ray pulsars , it may be that the inner disk boundary does not reach the stellar surface , and that the disk material one way or another penetrates the magnetosphere and slides down along lines of force .",
    "in this case , it is natural to associate the region of formation of the emission - line spectrum with the shock wave that should arise during the collision of the infalling gas with the stellar surface [ 12 - 14 ] . in accretion models ,",
    "the observed outflow of matter is interpreted in terms of a magnetohydrodynamic wind from the disk surface or directly from the stellar magnetosphere [ 2 , 12 , 15 ] .    in principle ,",
    "investigations of the profile shapes and relative intensities of ctts emission lines could elucidate the nature of the hot regions in young stars .",
    "however , numerous attempts to use lines of atoms and ions with low ionization potentials ( e.g. , the hydrogen balmer lines ) in such studies have not yet been successful : similar profiles are obtained for quite different assumptions about the geometry , velocity field , and physical conditions in the emission - line formation region [ 1,2,16,17 ] .",
    "moreover , high - angular - resolution spectral observations have shown that the profiles of these lines are formed both near the stellar surface and in the extended circumstellar envelope [ 18 , 19 ] .",
    "analyses of the line emission of ions with ionization potentials above 20  ev are much more promising in this connection [ 20 ] . at the present , the following is known about the profiles of these lines .",
    "\\(1 ) the heii @xmath54686 lines in ctts spectra have equivalent widths of less than 1  , and it became possible to investigate their profiles with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio only recently [ 21 - 23 ] . in all cases ( nine stars ) ,",
    "the profile of this line is asymmetric and redshifted by a few dozen kms@xmath8 .",
    "\\(2 ) in [ 24 ] , gomez de castro et al .",
    "analyze the profiles of the resonant lines of the siiii , siiv , ciii , and civ ions using archival high - resolution iue spectra of four cttss ( t tau , ru lup , dr tau , tw hya ) obtained in the 1980s .",
    "the profiles of lines that could be reliably distinguished against the noise background were asymmetric and redshifted . in the case of the civ @xmath51550 doublet lines ,",
    "two peaks of comparable intensities were reliably identified , with their maxima shifted by approximately @xmath9 and @xmath10 kms@xmath8 with respect to the laboratory wavelength .",
    "\\(3 ) in the spectra of many cttss , there are hei emission lines that are about an order of magnitude more intense than the heii @xmath54686 line . according to [ 1 ] ,",
    "the hei line profiles have a broad ( fwhm @xmath11 kms@xmath8 ) peak that is symmetric with respect to the laboratory wavelength . in a number of cases , a narrower ( fwhm @xmath12",
    "kms@xmath13 central component is superimposed . on the other hand , in high - resolution spectrograms with good signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "some stars have a broad absorption feature in the red wing of the @xmath55876 triplet ; in ry tau and bm and , the entire @xmath55876 line is in absorption , not emission [ 25 ] .    in [ 24 ,",
    "25 ] , it was proposed that the above features of the lines of helium and ions with ionization potentials above 20 ev can be understood if these lines form in a shock wave near the surface of the young star .",
    "note that the observations currently available do not exclude the possibility that cttss have a comparatively powerful chromosphere and/or corona , which may contribute to the line emission of ions with high degrees of ionization .",
    "therefore , studies of the emission of an accretion shock wave should also elucidate whether or not powerful chromospheres are present in low - mass young stars .    after calculating the shock - wave structure",
    ", we can find the intensities of specially selected `` signal '' lines ; comparisons with observations enable us to determine the velocity and density of the accreted gas , and also the total accretion rate and the area of the stellar surface on which the material falls . to determine the `` signal '' line profiles , it is necessary to appropriately sum the emission from different points in the shock wave ,",
    "so that analysis of the observed profiles and , in particular , their variation with the axial stellar rotation should yield information about the geometry of the accretion region .",
    "the structure of radiative shocks has been investigated in a number of studies in connection with various problems in the physics of the interstellar medium [ 26 , 27 ] and processes in the envelopes of nonstationary stars [ 28 ] .",
    "therefore , we should explain the peculiarities of the study of such shocks in the case of cttss , and why we can not apply already available results of gas - dynamical calculations to the interpretation of the spectra of young stars .",
    "the difference from the case of the interstellar medium is due to the fact that we consider a shock in a rather dense gas in which the velocity of the stream flowing into the front is @xmath14 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the much higher density means , for instance , that the forbidden lines of oi , oii , nii , etc .",
    ", can not play an important role in cooling the gas .",
    "moreover , in an interstellar medium with velocities higher than 100 kms@xmath8 , postshock radiative cooling does not play a significant role , and the gas relaxes adiabatically [ 26 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "shock waves in the envelopes of nonstationary stars are characterized by higher densities and velocities for the stream flowing into the front that are a factor of 2 - 3 lower [ 28 ] .",
    "thus , the situation of interest to us is , in some sense , intermediate , and has not previously been investigated to our knowledge .    before addressing the problem of the structure of an accretion shock wave in the case of a low - mass young star",
    ", we made some physical assumptions reflecting the specific character of the situation investigated , which made it possible to considerably simplify the general system of radiative gas - dynamical equations .",
    "therefore , the main goal of this work is to show that the results of our numerical calculations do not contradict our initial assumptions , and can serve as a basis for the quantitative interpretation of the spectra of young stars . in the last section",
    ", we will present data on the structure of accretion shocks and the calculated intensities of some observable resonant lines .",
    "consider a young star with mass @xmath15 and radius @xmath16 with a large - scale dipolar magnetic field surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "suppose that the stellar magnetic field stops the accretion disk at some distance @xmath17 ; the value of @xmath18 depends on the accretion rate @xmath19 and the intensity of the stellar magnetic field [ 12 - 14 ] .",
    "the disk material is frozen in the magnetic lines of force and slides along them under the action of the force of gravity , acquiring near the stellar surface a radial velocity [ 29 ] @xmath20 ( here , we assume that the angular velocity of the stellar rotation is much lower than the keplerian velocity @xmath21 according to the data of [ 30 ] and [ 25 ] , for the stars ru lup and ry tau , @xmath22 and 400  kms@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we will be interested in velocities for the infalling gas from 150 to 450 kms@xmath8 .    during the collision of the gas with the stellar surface ,",
    "a shock wave should arise .",
    "let us assume that this shock has the following qualitative structure [ 30 ] .",
    "the gas compressed in the shock front is strongly heated , then gradually decelerates and cools to a temperature of the order of the stellar effective temperature , smoothly passing into the stellar atmosphere , which is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the cooling takes place via volume losses to emission in resonant lines of the ions of the most abundant elements ; the largest fraction of the energy is in photons with energies above 13.6 ev .",
    "half of the photons from the cooling zone move away from the star and are absorbed by the preshock matter , creating a heating and ionization zone that is transparent in the continuum at @xmath23   .",
    "the other half of the photons are absorbed in the transition region between the radiative - cooling zone and the stellar atmosphere , and are then reemitted in the continuum .",
    "only a small fraction of these photons goes into the lyman continuum , so that the emission of the transition region and , consequently , its structure , virtually do not influence the structure of the higher - lying regions .    within the framework of these assumptions , we estimated in [ 30 ] the number density @xmath24 ( @xmath25 of the accreted gas far upstream from the front : it turned out that situations in which @xmath26 are of the most interest . for this interval of densities",
    ", we will also assume that the typical dimensions of the postshock radiative - cooling region and of the preshock hii region are smaller than the stellar radius , and are also smaller than the extent of the front perpendicular to the gas motion .",
    "therefore , we will consider the shock wave to be plane - parallel and will solve the corresponding one - dimensional problem .",
    "finally , we assume that the shock front is at rest with respect to the stellar surface , and that all the shock parameters depend only on the spatial coordinate .",
    "thus , we consider below a solution of the one - dimensional , radiative , gas - dynamical equations describing the structure of an accretion shock wave that is stationary in eulerian coordinates .",
    "in a stationary , one - dimensional shock wave , all parameters depend only on the spatial coordinate z , and it is assumed that @xmath27 everywhere in the gas - dynamical equations .",
    "we will also assume that a chaotic magnetic field is frozen in the infalling plasma , and that this field is much weaker than the large - scale stellar field channeling the flow of matter , but is still sufficiently intense to suppress the electron thermal conductivity .",
    "we are interested only in the field component perpendicular to the @xmath28 axis ; we designate the intensity of this component @xmath29    we will take the accreted matter to consist of a mixture of h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe , with the relative abundances @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the volume number densities of a given element [ 31 ] and the total number density of the nuclei of all elements , respectively .",

    "then , designating @xmath41 , we can write the equation of electric neutrality of the plasma @xmath42 where the last term takes into account the single ionization of ci by lines of the hydrogen lyman series in preshock hi regions . note that",
    ", at this stage , we are interested solely in lines of ions with high ionization potentials ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , we will not investigate the structure of the hi regions in detail ; we will show later , however , that these regions virtually do not affect the fluxes in the lines of interest to us .    in the absence of molecular hydrogen ,",
    "the continuity equation is [ 32 ] @xmath43 here and below , all quantities with the subscript 0 refer to the preshock unperturbed flow , i.e. , formally to @xmath44 we will assume that the gas temperatures for the various ions and atoms are the same and are equal to @xmath45 but , generally speaking , are different from the temperature @xmath46 of the electron gas .",
    "we will express the gas density in terms of the mean molecular weight @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mass and atomic weights of an element . since the pressure of an ideal gas is @xmath51 the momentum conservation law in our case",

    "we assume that the cooling postshock gas is transparent to its own `` cooling '' radiation down to a temperature of @xmath69  k , and that the heating and ionization of this gas by this radiation takes place _ upstream _ from the shock front and far _ downstream _ from the front , in the so - called transition region",

    "we took our list of the most intense lines ( in total about 150 ) from [ 36 ] , and the expressions for @xmath91 from the reviews [ 37 ] .",
    "consider the ionization equilibrium equations .",
    "let @xmath94 be the rate of photoionization of the @xmath35th ion of element @xmath36 from all its subshells per unit volume . then , assuming @xmath95 if @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 the subscript @xmath74 denotes the electron shells of the ion considered ( @xmath101 @xmath102 is an analogous quantity characterizing the rate of photoionization only from those shells for which the removal of an electron is accompanied by the auger effect .    generally speaking , the transition of an ion @xmath35 to the @xmath103 state may take place as a result of radiative , dielectronic , or three - particle recombination . in the situation considered here , nearly everywhere @xmath104 according to [ 38 ] , at such densities , collisions with electrons disrupt highly excited ionic states , leading to a substantial decrease of the dielectronic recombination rate , since captures to high - lying levels play the major role in this process . for @xmath105",
    "the radiative recombination rates depend much more weakly on the density , since the contribution of high - lying states is much smaller in this case . using the data in [ 39 - 41 ]",
    ", we came to the following conclusions about the dielectronic recombination rate for the interval of densities and temperatures of interest to us : ( 1 ) for ions with charges smaller than six , it is considerably lower than the radiative recombination rate ; ( 2 ) for hydrogen - and helium - like ions , density - dependent corrections do not exceed 20% .",

    "three - particle recombination plays an appreciable role only at rather high densities ; the main contribution to this process comes from captures to high - lying levels .",
    "in particular , for hydrogen at a temperature of @xmath106  k and with @xmath107 the rate of three - particle recombination to the first level is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than the total radiative recombination rate [ 32 ] .",
    "interactions with ions and electrons in a plasma with such parameters limit the number of stable levels of the hydrogen atom to a value not greater than 100 [ 42 ] .",
    "apparently , this means that , in the problem at hand , the rate of three - particle recombination for hydrogen nowhere exceeds @xmath108% of the radiative recombination rate ; for this reason , we did not take it into account . since the rate of three - particle recombination rapidly decreases with increasing nuclear charge [",

    "formally , we took this into account by adding the terms @xmath121 and/or @xmath122 to equation ( 12 ) if the rate of the corresponding reaction ( @xmath123 or @xmath124 ) exceeded @xmath125 @xmath126 we also considered the reverse reactions with @xmath127 in accordance with [ 44 ] for the atoms @xmath128 and @xmath129    we will assume that ionizing radiation is generated only behind the shock front , and that the generation region has a small optical depth in all lines . in this case , we can write for the flux of radiation propagating away from ( or toward ) the star @xmath130 the expression for the flux in lines with energies below 13.6  ev forming behind the front , but outside the transition region , has a similar appearance .",
    "below , we will ascribe the subscript @xmath76 to lines with energies above 13.6 ev and use the subscript @xmath131 in the general case .    in [ 30 ] , we showed that , in the problem at hand , the temperature of the postshock electron gas is appreciably lower than @xmath132  k. at such temperatures , the gas is cooled primarily by discrete transitions , but the continuum radiation makes a significant contribution to the x - ray emission [ 36 ] .",
    "therefore , when calculating the spectrum of the cooling zone , we took into account recombination emission by h , he , and the cvi , cvii , oviii , and oix ions [ 36 ] , as well as free - free emission [ 45 ] .",
    "in contrast to [ 36 ] , we did not take into account two - photon emission , since its contribution is small when @xmath133 [ 46 ] .",
    "if self - ionizing radiation is not generated upstream from the front , the variation of the flux of ionizing photons with distance from the front ( @xmath134 is described by the law @xmath135 with @xmath136 where the summation is over elements , ions , and shells for which @xmath137 jumping ahead for a moment , we note that the contribution of lines with @xmath138  to the cooling function of the preshock gas proves to be insignificant , which justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of approximation ( 14 ) .    the kinetic energy of the directed motion of the gas is converted into the thermal energy of atomic nuclei in a layer that we call the shock front . according to [ 32 ] ,",

    "the electron gas at the viscous jump is compressed adiabatically , and the degree of ionization remains virtually unchanged [ 32 ] .",

    "photons with @xmath155  ev are absorbed upstream from the shock front and in the upper layers of the stellar atmosphere , and are then reprocessed into radiation with @xmath154  ev , which escapes from the system .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath156 far upstream from the front should be of the order of several thousand kelvin , i.e. , @xmath157  ev . the magnetic energy associated with the infalling plasma is even smaller ( see below ) . on the other hand , for @xmath158 kms@xmath8 , @xmath159 ev .",
    "it therefore follows from ( 17 ) that the energy of the infalling material is nearly entirely in the form of kinetic energy , which is spent primarily in radiative cooling , while the losses to gas ionization are small .",
    "it is convenient to express the line emission flux @xmath160 in units of @xmath161 , introducing the quantities @xmath162 characterizing the fraction of energy emitted in the line @xmath131 downstream from the shock front : @xmath163 with @xmath164      in accordance with [ 26 , 32 ] , we expect that the velocity and density of the preshock gas change little , so that @xmath165 where @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 as a consequence of ( 2 ) , @xmath169 and it follows from ( 5 ) that @xmath170    upstream from the shock front , the electrons are heated directly by photoionization , and we can not say in advance whether the energy exchange with heavy particles will be efficient enough for their temperature to become essentially the same as that of the electron gas . we can answer this question by solving a model problem in which pure hydrogen is heated by a single ionizing line and the preshock gas has a constant velocity @xmath171    we will provisionally neglect recombination , ionization , and radiative losses due to electron - collisional excitation .",
    "we then obtain from equations ( 6)-(8 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 15 ) : @xmath172 setting @xmath173 , and @xmath174 we have @xmath175 this means that , as the ionizing photons are absorbed in the stream flowing into the front and the gas is heated , the electron temperature is detached from the ion temperature .",
    "however , when the electron temperature exceeds @xmath106  k , we can no longer neglect cooling of the gas by electron - collisional excitation of the @xmath176 line .",
    "figure 1 , which is based on our numerical calculations , shows that this effect limits the growth of @xmath177 and that the energy exchange with heavy particles rapidly equalizes @xmath46 and @xmath178 it is important that the temperatures become virtually identical at a rather large optical depth : in the case shown in fig.1 ( @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181  k , @xmath158 kms@xmath182 @xmath46 differs from @xmath183 by less than 10% at @xmath184 this implies that less than 1% of the energy pumped into the gas by the flux of ionizing radiation is radiated in the region where the flow has a substantially two - temperature character .",

    "all else aside , this makes it possible to reduce the number of free parameters . in the case",
    "considered of an intermediate - density gas , the structure of the preshock region should depend on @xmath201 since the level populations of some ions that appreciably contribute to the cooling function ( e.g. , ciii , oiv , and ov ) depend on density ; however , this dependence proved to be rather weak .    to solve the resulting system of equations",

    "it is natural to assume that the gas is neutral at @xmath213 this automatically implies that the infalling matter is sufficiently abundant to completely absorb the ionizing radiation escaping from beneath the front . generally speaking , however",
    ", this is not the case , since many cttss are x - ray sources .",
    "it is probable that , owing to the curvature of the magnetic lines of force , the motion of the infalling gas is appreciably non - rectilinear ( radial ) , even at heights @xmath214 above the stellar surface . in this case ,",
    "the hardest part of the postshock radiation will at some time cross the boundaries of the accretion column and will be able to reach the observer , in contrast to lower - energy photons , which are absorbed in the infalling gas at heights @xmath215 ( it is probably for this reason that the x - ray spectra of cttss resembles the radiation of a plasma with a temperature of @xmath216  k , while the temperature of the post - shock gas is considerably lower . )    thus , because of the curvature of the lines of force guiding the infall of material , some of the most energetic photons born at the point of intersection of the corresponding line of force with the stellar surface will not reach the gas at heights @xmath217 however , this will to some extent be compensated by the absorption of hard radiation escaping from the limits of the accretion column above other points of the stellar surface . since there are not currently any observational data about the field geometry in cttss , we will assume that , due to this compensation , the plane - parallel approximation remains valid at heights @xmath217 more precisely , we assumed that when @xmath218 , h , he , n , o , and ne are in atomic form , whereas c , mg , si , s , and fe are singly ionized by lyman lines of hi .",
    "naturally , after solving the equations for this problem , we must verify that the extent of the preshock ionization zone does not exceed the radius @xmath18 of the inner edge of the disk .    in this approach",
    ", determining the heat and ionization balance of the preshock region is a boundary - value problem ( some of the boundary conditions are specified at the shock front and some at infinity ) , which we solved as follows . at sufficiently large values of @xmath219 we set trial values of @xmath220 @xmath221 and integrated the equations to @xmath211",
    "if , in this case , some @xmath208 differed from zero by more than 0.01 , we repeated the integration , changing the values of @xmath222 accordingly .    to solve this problem",
    ", we must have a set of values @xmath223 for @xmath224 which can be found only after determining the structure of the postshock region .",
    "however , for this , we must know the temperature and ion composition of the gas immediately upstream from the front .",
    "thus , we obtained a self - consistent solution for the shock - wave structure using an iterative procedure : first , we determined the preshock gas parameters for a trial set of @xmath223 values , which made it possible to find first - approximation values of the @xmath225 using these , we again performed the calculations for the preshock region , and so on , until the new @xmath223 values were virtually identical to the previous ones .",
    "let us now consider the simplifications we used to solve the complete system of equations for the post - shock region .",
    "first and foremost , we assumed that , at @xmath226  k , the gas in the recombination region is transparent to the continuum and to its own `` cooling '' radiation ; therefore , we did not take photoionization into account in this zone .",
    "in addition , we assumed that the density is so high ( @xmath227 @xmath228 in the transition region between the cooling zone and stellar photosphere , where the `` cooling''-radiation photons are absorbed , that , due to thermalization , radiative cooling occurs mainly in the continuum at @xmath229  , to which all higher - lying layers are transparent .",
    "this assumption allows us to completely avoid considering the transition - region structure at this stage , since we are currently interested only in the line emission of `` high - temperature '' ions ( see above ) .",
    "the structure and emission of the transition zone is important in analyses of the nature of the so - called `` veiling '' continuum of t tauri stars and , perhaps , the hydrogen and hei emission - line spectra [ 30 ] . note that the gas velocity in the transition region is nearly zero , whereas it is of the order of 300 kms@xmath8 in the preshock region . therefore , even if emission in lyman - series lines carries away appreciable energy from the transition region , this should not strongly influence the thermal balance of the preshock zone .    in the postshock region , it is more convenient to use the variable @xmath230 in place of @xmath178 an equation for this variable can be derived by adding ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) : @xmath231    eliminating the derivative @xmath232 from this equation and equation ( 7 ) , we obtain after some manipulation two equations , which we used in place of equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) : @xmath233 @xmath234 here , we have introduced the notation @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237 @xmath238 @xmath239 and @xmath240 as in ( 16 ) , we denote parameters immediately downstream from the viscous jump with the subscript 2 ; @xmath241 and @xmath242 an additional relationship is provided by the algebraic equation @xmath243 which can be obtained from ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) .",
    "it follows from ( 16 ) that , immediately downstream from the viscous jump , the ion temperature reaches @xmath244  k , while the electron temperature only grows to @xmath245  k. an energy exchange between the electrons and ions begins , and the temperatures are equalized at @xmath246 in this region , up to @xmath247 , we used @xmath248 as the independent variable ; for this purpose , we performed a termwise division of all the differential equations by the equation for @xmath249 after this , we used @xmath250 as the independent variable , up until the time when the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath183 became less than 1% .",
    "finally , in the recombination zone , we used a one - temperature approximation and @xmath251 as the independent variable , simultaneously leaving out equation ( 24 ) for @xmath252 we solved the equations in this region up until the time when the gas temperature fell to @xmath253  k.",
    "we solved the above system of radiative gas - dynamical equations numerically , using dedicated software for this purpose .",
    "we used a number of test problems to debug this program and verify its correctness , which ultimately gave us confidence in the reliability of the results obtained .",
    "in particular , the results of the numerical calculations coincide with analytical solutions we obtained for the case of a hydrogen plasma under certain additional assumptions .",
    "our calculations of the ionization equilibrium for all elements included in the program coincide with the results of [ 36 ] in a ( stationary ) coronal approximation ; however , the cooling function @xmath254 we obtained for this case differs from that of [ 36 ] on average by a factor of two , since we used more accurate formulas for the electron - collisional excitation rates , according to the recommendations of [ 37 ] .",
    "we used a special subroutine for the numerical solution of systems of stiff differential equations . to test its performance , we computed the ionization balance in a plasma with an arbitrary initial density of ions of various elements for the case of a stepwise change of its temperature : the solutions smoothly converged to the values obtained in the stationary case for a finite temperature .",
    "we also calculated the ionization balance and cooling function of an optically thin plasma for the case of isobaric cooling ( this situation is similar to the behavior of the postshock gas [ 32 ] ) and obtained agreement with [ 47 ] , with appropriate variation of the atomic data .",
    "finally , we note that , in the computations for the accretion shock wave , the sum of the @xmath34 values for each element differed from unity by less than @xmath255    let us now turn to the results obtained .",
    "first and foremost , it follows from our calculations that the fluxes in the signal lines ( see below ) are virtually constant if    \\(1 ) we take the initial temperature @xmath156 of the infalling gas far upstream from the front to be in the interval from 3000 to 6000 k ;    \\(2 ) in our calculations of the preshock region structure , we do not take into account ( pseudo)lines of the ionizing radiation , for which @xmath256    \\(3 ) we begin to integrate the equations describing the structure of the preshock region at values @xmath257 exceeding 5 ( in accordance with section 2 , we chose the optical depth of the line with the maximum energy of those with @xmath258 as the independent variable ) ;    \\(4 ) we vary the intensity of the @xmath28 component of the chaotic magnetic field @xmath198 frozen in the infalling plasma in the range from 0 to 0.1  g.    this last result deserves special attention",
    ". the chaotic magnetic field can suppress the electron thermal conductivity if the larmor radius of an electron in this field is smaller than the mean free path of the electrons between collisions .",
    "using formulas from [ 32 ] , we can write this condition @xmath259 in the cases of interest for us , @xmath260 @xmath228 and @xmath261  k in the preshock region ( see below )",
    ". thus , the assertion in section 4 _ a posteriori _ indicates the fundamental possibility of determining the structure of an accretion shock wave while simultaneously neglecting the electron thermal conductivity and the chaotic magnetic field frozen in the infalling plasma ; this considerably simplifies the system of gas - dynamical equations .",
    "it is another question whether the accreted plasma is , in fact , magnetized , and whether we must in reality take into account the heating of the preshock gas by electron thermal conductivity ; this question can be answered only after a comparison of the calculated and observed spectra .",
    "below , we give a relatively detailed description of the shock - wave structure for the case when @xmath158  kms@xmath8 and @xmath262 @xmath263 and then show how the main parameters of the wave change as functions of @xmath80 and @xmath200 we will use 5000  k and 5 for the initial values of @xmath156 and @xmath264 respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the electron and ton temperatures downstream and upstream from the shock front .",
    "we can see that the temperature of the gas approaching the front grows and reaches @xmath265  k immediately upstream from the front . since @xmath266   k , in accordance with ( 21 ) , we can consider our initial assumption that the variations of the preshock gas density and velocity are small to be justified .",
    "we will characterize the size of the preshock region by the distance from the front @xmath267 at which the temperature of the infalling gas reaches a value exceeding @xmath156 by 50% ; in the case considered , @xmath268 cm .    in accordance with ( 16 ) , the ion temperature reaches @xmath269  k immediately downstream from the front , while the electron temperature only grows to @xmath270  k. further , @xmath183 monotonically decreases due to the exchange of energy with the electrons .",
    "the postshock electron - gas temperature first increases to @xmath271  k at @xmath272  cm , then monotonically decreases as the radiative losses begin to dominate over the heating by the ions . at the peak of @xmath177",
    "the difference of the electron and ion temperatures is less than 1% , justifying use of a one - temperature approximation .",
    "the gas cools to @xmath273  k at a distance @xmath274 cm from the front . here",
    ", we should note that both @xmath275 and @xmath276    since @xmath277 and the width of the region in which the ions are heated is an order of magnitude smaller , our approximation of the front as an infinitesimally thin jump is justified .",
    "in addition , @xmath278 differs from @xmath279 by only 3% ; therefore , this suggests that we can consider the entire postshock region in a one - temperature approximation ( see the comment at the end of section 3 ) . however , there are two reasons why we did not do this",
    ". the first is associated with the signal - line profiles : in the one - temperature approximation , their widths immediately downstream from the front due to thermal motion will be systematically larger than observed .",
    "second , in the region where the ion temperature exceeds @xmath280 nuclear reactions converting deuterium to @xmath281he can occur .",
    "we plan to treat the corresponding set of problems in a separate study , and here restrict our consideration to the comment that , according to our estimates , the energy release of these nuclear reactions is sufficiently small that they should exert virtually no effect on the shock - wave structure .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra of the ionizing radiation escaping from the gas cooling zone for three values of @xmath80 and for @xmath282 or , more precisely , the values of @xmath223 for the 50 energy intervals ( pseudolines ) . the dashed line at @xmath283 enables us to determine which pseudolines play an appreciable role in the heat and ionization balance in the preshock region . in particular",
    ", it follows from this figure that , for @xmath158 kms@xmath8 , the line with the maximum energy is that with @xmath284 ( @xmath285  ev ) , whose optical depth we used as the independent variable in this case .",
    "we will now consider how the gas ionization varies along the flow .",
    "the preshock hii region is approximately half the size of @xmath286 @xmath287  cm .",
    "as the gas approaches the front , the degree of ionization of the hydrogen steadily increases , reaching @xmath288 immediately upstream from the front , 96% of the helium is in the form of heiii ; carbon and oxygen ions up to a charge of @xmath289 nitrogen , neon , magnesium , and silicon ions up to a charge of @xmath290 and sulfur and iron ions up to a charge of @xmath291 all have abundances exceeding 1% .",
    "immediately downstream from the front , the time scale for heating of the electrons is much shorter than the time scale for ionization and recombination ; therefore , the ionization equilibrium can not be established after the rapid growth of the temperature . as a result ,",
    "the abundance of , for example , civ ions exceeds 1% up to @xmath292  k , and that of ovi ions becomes less than 1% only at @xmath293  k. recall that , in an equilibrium situation , these ions are virtually absent at temperatures exceeding @xmath294 and @xmath295  k , respectively . in short",
    ", the degree of ionization of the gas is considerably lower than the equilibrium value over nearly the entire region of growth of @xmath252    as the ion and electron temperatures equalize , the time scale for the growth of @xmath46 decreases .",
    "therefore , near the peak of the electron temperature , the ion abundances roughly correspond to the equilibrium values for @xmath296 however , soon after the electrons have begun to cool , the cooling time scale becomes much shorter than the recombination time scale , and the equilibrium again breaks down . now the degree of ionization is higher than the equilibrium value : for instance , the civ and ovi ions reach their maximum abundances only at temperatures of the order of @xmath297 and @xmath298  k , respectively !",
    "it follows from the above discussion , in particular , that the recombination of ions with charges less than six occurs at temperatures much lower than in an equilibrium situation .",
    "however , this means that , in our case , the role of dielectronic recombination is less important than usual .",
    "this suggests that , even if our description of dielectronic recombination is not entirely correct , this does not strongly affect the results obtained .",
    "we calculated the shock - wave structure in the approximation of volume radiative - energy losses ; now we must test to what extent this is justified .",
    "we will start from the fact that typical values of the critical density for allowed dipole transitions are @xmath299 @xmath126 for the part of the preshock hii region where @xmath300 the optical depth in the @xmath301 line proved to be @xmath302 ( in the model with @xmath158 kms@xmath8 and @xmath262 @xmath303 therefore , the probability of escape of a @xmath301 photon from this region , which is to order of magnitude equal to @xmath304 considerably exceeds the probability of thermalization , equal to @xmath305 beyond the region considered , the hydrogen becomes neutral , and the optical depth of the @xmath301 line grows rapidly , reaching @xmath306 at @xmath307 ; however , the electron number density and gas temperature simultaneously decrease .",
    "this means that we can use the volume energy - loss approximation throughout the region where the contribution of the @xmath301 line to the cooling function plays an appreciable role . for resonant lines of other elements with @xmath23  ,",
    "our assumption of the volume character of the preshock radiative losses is even better satisfied ; for example , for the @xmath51550 line of civ , @xmath308    similar estimates based on the results of our calculations show that the volume energy - loss approximation is also justified downstream from the shock front . in this very region ,",
    "the gas turned out to be transparent to the lyman continuum , confirming that we can neglect photoionization processes here .",
    "we have intentionally distinguished the postshock region with @xmath226  k. the reason is that , at lower temperatures , hii and heii , which should efficiently absorb photons with @xmath155  ev traveling toward the star , begin to intensely recombine . in this transition zone between the shock wave and the stellar atmosphere ,",
    "the gas velocity is nearly zero , and the gas density is several orders of magnitude higher than upstream from the front : for example , in the model considered , @xmath309 kms@xmath8 and @xmath310 @xmath228 for @xmath273  k. this indicates that we can not use the volumeloss approximation for @xmath311  k ; instead , we must solve for the heating of the stellar atmosphere by external short - wavelength radiation taking into account the effects of radiative transfer in the lines and continuum , as was done in [ 48 ] .",
    "the calculations show that up to the time when our approach is no longer adequate , the abundances of ions with charges exceeding @xmath312 become negligible for all the elements we have considered .",
    "it is likely that ions with charges @xmath313 and higher will not appear in significant numbers in the transition zone , due to the high density of material there .",
    "this statement is based on the calculation of the transition - region structure carried out using the method we applied for the preshock zone , i.e. , without taking into account the effects of thermalization of the radiation .",
    "the true temperature distribution inside the heating region may considerably differ from the calculated distribution , but we do not see why the efficiency of radiative recombination and charge exchange  which give rise to the near complete absence of highly - charged ions in our model of the transition zone  should decrease .",
    "table 1 shows the main parameters characterizing the structure of an accretion shock wave as functions of @xmath80 and @xmath200 we can see that the preshock gas temperature decreases somewhat with increasing @xmath24 as a consequence of the reduced contribution of intercombination lines to the cooling function .",
    "this effect influences the geometric factors to a much lesser extent : @xmath267 and @xmath314 are nearly inversely proportional to @xmath200 the dependence of the parameters on @xmath80 is rather trivial , and , in our view , does not require additional discussion .",
    ".parameters of the structure of an accretion shock wave [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we noted above , there is no thermalization of the signal - line emission . since the parameters of the preshock h ii regions obtained in our numerical calculations are nearly identical to those used in [ 30 ] , we suggest that , if the preshock gas density does not strongly exceed @xmath315 @xmath263 radiation at @xmath23  leaves the shock nearly unimpeded .",
    "this means that , in spite of the considerable optical depth , the intensity ratio for the components of the civ @xmath51550 doublet should be 2 : 1 , since this is equal to the ratio of the electron - collisional excitation coefficients for the corresponding levels , which is nearly equal to the ratio of the statistical weights of these levels .",
    "the observed intensity ratio for the @xmath51548 and @xmath51551 lines in t tauri stars is 2 : 1 , but , in accordance with the arguments above , this should in no way be taken as proof that these lines are optically thin , as asserted in [ 3 , 7 , 24 ] .    in the signal lines ,",
    "whose optical depth considerably exceeds 1 , the observed emission flux should depend on the area of the accretion zone and its orientation with respect to the observer , while the fluxes of optically thin lines are determined by the emission measure .",
    "therefore , the relative intensities of the signal lines in the spectrum of a star , generally speaking , should differ from those listed in table 2 .",
    "for the same reason , in stars with different accretion - zone geometries , both the line profiles and the overall appearance of the emission - line spectrum should differ , even if their values of @xmath80 and @xmath24 are identical .",
    "based on the discussion in the previous section , we expect that , in the framework of our assumptions , we have correctly calculated the line - emission intensities for ions with charges above @xmath316 we have also shown that the results of our numerical calculations confirm _ a posteriori _ the validity of our main assumptions , adopted to simplify the system of hydrodynamical equations used to model the structure of an accretion shock wave .",
    "it is important that the relative intensities and profiles of the spectral lines strongly depend on @xmath80 and @xmath317 consequently , the results obtained have diagnostic value .",
    "all this leads us to believe that comparison of the calculated fluxes and profiles of the ciii , civ , siiii , siiv , etc .",
