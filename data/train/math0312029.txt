    "<S> the key point is that @xmath76 is chosen independent of @xmath57 . ) intuitively , the fatou set is the region of order , where the iterates @xmath17 are well behaved ; the julia set is the region of chaos , where a small error becomes huge after many iterations of @xmath20 .    alternately , by the arzel - ascoli theorem , one may define the fatou set of a complex function to be the set of points where @xmath17 forms a normal family . </S>",
    "<S> however , because @xmath2 is not locally compact , and therefore the arzel - ascoli theorem fails , non - archimedean fatou sets are usually defined in terms of equicontinuity .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to verify that the fatou set is open and that @xmath77 ; similarly , the julia set is closed , and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> one may partition the ( complex ) fatou set of @xmath59 into connected components ; the function @xmath20 then maps each component into ( and in fact onto ) a component . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may speak of fixed , periodic , and preperiodic components . </S>",
    "<S> a component which is not preperiodic ( that is , a component with infinite forward orbit ) is called a _ wandering domain _ of @xmath20 . in 1985 , </S>",
    "<S> sullivan @xcite proved , using quasiconformal conjugations , that a complex rational function @xmath59 can not have wandering domains .    a similar theory of components of the fatou set exists for non - archimedean rational functions @xmath79 ; see section  [ sect : fat ] below , where we give a precise characterization of such components for our setting . </S>",
    "<S> however , in spite of the existence of certain non - archimedean versions of teichmller spaces @xcite , there is no apparent analogue of actual quasiconformal maps suitable for use as conjugating functions in @xmath80 . in particular , the author s constructions of wandering domains over any algebraically closed complete non - archimedean field ( see @xcite for residue characteristic zero , @xcite for @xmath1 , and this paper for general fields of positive residue characteristic ) suggest that sullivan s proof has no analogue for @xmath2 , and that no appropriate versions of quasiconformal maps exist in that context .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the author showed in @xcite that given some weak hypotheses on @xmath81 ( including the assumption that the coefficients of @xmath20 are algebraic over @xmath44 ) , the fatou set has no wandering domains . </S>",
    "<S> for more general fields , the arguments in @xcite imply that if @xmath79 is defined over a locally compact subfield of @xmath2 , and if the julia set of @xmath20 contains no critical points , then @xmath20 has no wandering domains .    </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that the condition concerning critical points is unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , the condition that @xmath20 be defined over a locally compact field is crucial . indeed , the main result of this paper is the following theorem . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that if the residue field @xmath37 has positive characteristic , then there are many polynomials defined over the ( not locally compact ) field @xmath2 which have wandering domains in @xmath5 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath2 be an algebraically closed complete non - archimedean field with residue field @xmath37 and residue characteristic @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath82 with @xmath83 , and let @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> there is some @xmath84 with @xmath85 such that the fatou set @xmath19 of the function @xmath86 has a wandering component .    a weaker version of the above result appeared in @xcite , with some details of the proof omitted . </S>",
    "<S> there , it was assumed that @xmath87 , and it was only shown that there is at least one @xmath88 giving a wandering domain . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , an examination of that proof reveals that the point @xmath89 constructed has @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the proof of the main theorem of @xcite fails for fields @xmath2 of positive characteristic .    </S>",
    "<S> although the statement and proof of the above theorem is similar in structure to its predecessor in @xcite , it is much stronger . </S>",
    "<S> first , the lemmas in section  [ sect : param ] of the current paper are more complicated than their analogues in @xcite , in order to apply to the more general class of fields @xmath2 ( including fields of characteristic @xmath0 , not just residue characteristic @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , a slight modification of the main proof allows the broader statement that the set of parameters @xmath89 giving wandering domains is dense in the large open subset @xmath91 of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> that large subset can not be extended ; there can be no wandering domains for @xmath92 with @xmath93 , because such @xmath92 are conjugate to maps of the form @xmath94 with @xmath95 , which have good reduction and therefore empty julia set .    </S>",
    "<S> our proof uses some computations specific to this family , but the general method should apply to a larger class of functions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the main properties of @xmath92 required in the proof are that it maps a disk @xmath96 ( in this case , about @xmath97 ) onto itself with degree divisible by @xmath0 , and another disk @xmath98 ( in this case , about @xmath99 ) onto @xmath96 with degree prime to @xmath0 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath87 has characteristic zero , fernndez @xcite has extended the argument in @xcite to show that there is an open set in the higher - dimensional parameter space of all degree @xmath100 polynomials in @xmath101 $ ] for which a dense subset of parameters exhibit wandering domains . </S>",
    "<S> ( she adds our map @xmath92 to an arbitrary polynomial @xmath102 with coefficients of sufficiently small absolute value and shows , by essentially the same argument as in @xcite , that @xmath89 can be adjusted by an arbitrarily small amount to guarantee that @xmath103 has a wandering domain . ) </S>",
    "<S> it should be straightforward to reproduce fernndez argument for the more general case of @xmath5 $ ] using the methods of this paper , where we do not assume , as fernndez and @xcite do , that one may divide by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the proof of our theorem is already so heavy with notation that we prefer to avoid the further tedium of proving the higher - dimensional density statement . </S>",
    "<S> still , we hope that the interested reader will be able to glean enough from our proof and from that of fernndez to deduce how the statement can be extended to the higher - dimensional parameter space .    </S>",
    "<S> some comments are in order regarding the field of definition of the parameters @xmath89 in the theorem . as previously mentioned </S>",
    "<S> , the results of @xcite imply that if @xmath89 were defined over a locally compact subfield @xmath104 , and if @xmath92 had no critical points in its julia set ( that is , if @xmath92 were _ hyperbolic _ ) , then @xmath92 would have no wandering domains . </S>",
    "<S> however , the parameter @xmath89 chosen in our proof can not lie in a discretely valued field . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting map @xmath92 will , after many iterations , map all points @xmath105 in the wandering disk @xmath96 to points @xmath106 for which the ratio @xmath107 of valuations is a rational number of arbitrarily large denominator . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation could not occur if the map @xmath92 were defined over a discretely valued field ; in particular , @xmath89 can not lie in any locally compact subfield of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the truth of the theorem above requires the freedom to choose @xmath84 ; a condition like @xmath108 would be too restrictive . </S>"
