    "electronic mail  email  remains an essential tool for social interactions and a popular platform for computer - mediated communication .",
    "it is used within organizations to exchange information and coordinate action , but also by ordinary people to converse with friends .",
    "patterns of email interactions reveal circadian rhythms  @xcite and bursty dynamics of human activity  @xcite , and the structure of evolving conversations  @xcite . understanding how these patterns shape email use is necessary for designing the next generation of interaction tools that will improve the efficiency of communication and coordination in social groups .",
    "early studies of email examined how people process  @xcite , organize  @xcite , and respond  @xcite to email messages . by surveying users within organizations , researchers uncovered common email triage strategies , with some users processing emails serially , while others read and reply to important messages first  @xcite .",
    "those studies had relatively small sample sizes and were limited by their methodology to answering qualitative questions about email behavior . as a result , we do not have answers to a number of questions about how people use email .",
    "how many email conversations do people have ?",
    "how long are these conversations and how do they end ? when do people respond to a message in a conversation ?",
    "do they adapt their replies to the behavior of their conversation partner ?",
    "furthermore , as the volume of email has increased steadily over the years , the concept of `` email overload '' has grown in prominence .",
    "dabbish & kraut  @xcite defined `` email overload '' as _ `` email users perceptions that their own use of email has gotten out of control because they receive and send more email than they can handle , find , or process effectively.''_. this motivates a whole set of questions that have been recently addressed in the setting of online social networks  @xcite , but never fully in the context of email .",
    "how does the volume of incoming email , information or email load , affect user behavior ?",
    "how do people compensate for the increased load : do they take longer to reply , or do they send shorter replies that take less time to compose ?",
    "we address these questions with a largest study to date of email conversations ( 16b emails ) .",
    "we focus our analyses on the replying behavior within _ dyadic interactions _ , i.e. , conversations between pairs of users .",
    "specifically , we measure the time a user takes to reply to a message , the length of the reply , as well as the fraction of messages a user replies to .",
    "first , we empirically characterize replying behavior in email conversations in a large population of users , and also how these behaviors vary by gender and age .",
    "although we find no significant variation due to gender , we find that younger email users reply faster and write shorter replies than older users .",
    "next , we study how email load , measured by the number of received email messages , affects replying behavior .",
    "we find that while users attempt to adapt to the rising information load by replying to more emails , they do not adequately compensate . as email load increases , they reply faster but to a decreasing fraction of incoming emails .",
    "these findings suggest that email overload is a problem , with users generally unable to keep up with rising load .",
    "we also study how replying behavior evolves over the course of a conversation .",
    "we find that users initially synchronize their behaviors , with reply times and length of replies becoming more similar in the first half of the conversation .",
    "however , they become desynchronized in the second half of the conversation . in contrast , users continue to coordinate their linguistic styles , as messages exchanged over the course of the entire conversation become more similar in content and style .",
    "finally , we develop a model to predict users replying behavior in a conversation , namely , how long it will take the user to reply to a message , the length of the reply , and if the reply will end the thread .",
    "the features that we use for prediction include history of communication between the users , user demographics , email load , as well as the day of the week and time the message was received .",
    "our predictive model considerably outperforms the baseline in all three cases .",
    "we obtain accuracy of 58.8% for reply time , which is a 67.1% relative improvement over the baseline , and 71.8% accuracy for length of replies ( 113.7% relative improvement over the baseline ) .",
    "we also predict the last email of the thread with accuracy of 65.9% , a 30.2% relative improvement over the baseline .",
    "ability to accurately predict what messages a user will reply to can be used by email clients to rank emails in the users inbox by their replying priority , thus helping ease the burden of information overload .",
    "the key contributions of our work are :    1 .",
    "we empirically characterize email _ replying behavior _ of users , focusing on reply time , length of the reply , and the correlation between them .",
    "we quantify how different factors , including the day and time the message was received , the device used , the number of attachments in the email , and user demographics affect replying .",
    "we show that _ email overload _ is evident in email usage and has adverse effects , resulting in users replying to a smaller fraction of received emails .",
    "users tend to send shorter replies , but with shorter delays when receiving many emails .",
    "we find that different age groups cope with overload differently : younger users shorten their replies , while older users reply to smaller fraction of received messages .",
    "we find evidence of _ synchronization _ in dyadic interactions within a thread : users become more similar in terms of reply time and length of replies until the middle of a thread , and start acting more independently after that . 4 .",
    "we can predict reply time and length , and the last email in a thread with a much higher accuracy than the baseline .",
    "this has important implications for designing future email clients .",
    "yahoo mail is one of the largest email providers in the world , with over 300 m users ( according to comscore[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) , who generate an extremely high volume of messages .",
    "obviously , not all the email addresses are associated with real people and are used instead by organizations or possibly bots to generate emails for commercial promotions and spam  @xcite . to meet the goal of studying social interactions , it is necessary to subsample the data to a set of interactions that are likely occurring between real people .",
    "for this reason , we apply a conservative filtering strategy and focus our study on user pairs ( or _ dyads _ ) that exhibit _ reciprocal interaction _",
    "( i.e. , bi - directionality of emails sent ) and exchange some minimum number of messages .",
    "this ensures that _",
    "i ) _ all the email addresses of the dyadic endpoints are likely associated with human users , and that _ ii ) _ the emails sent between them are not automatically generated .    accordingly , we selected a random subsample @xmath0 of 1.3 m dyads of yahoo mail users worldwide who have significant interactions with each other , sending at least five replies in each direction in the time span of undisclosed number of months . for privacy and policy reasons , the dataset includes messages belonging exclusively to users who voluntarily opted - in for such studies . consequently , considering a pair of users who exchanged more than 5 emails , both users need to be opt - in users to be included in the study . these pairs",
    "comprise a set @xmath1 containing 2 m unique users exchanging 187 m emails overall .",
    "we refer to the full sequence of emails flowing within the dyad as a _",
    "conversation_. next , we gathered _ all _ incoming and outgoing emails of users in @xmath1 over the same time period , a total of 16b emails .",
    "note that these emails included only emails from commercial domains and emails to and from other opt - in yahoo users . due to yahoo policy",
    ", the study did not include personal email messages between yahoo users and other email clients .",
    "in addition , we excluded notifications from social network sites , such as facebook or twitter , which represent a considerable portion of commercial , automatically - generated emails .",
    "we conduct our study at two different levels : at the dyadic level , we consider only the emails flowing between dyad endpoints ; at the global level , we consider the entire dataset . in the latter case ,",
    "commercial and spam messages will be likely be part of the incoming emails directed to users in @xmath1 .",
    "as one of the goals of this work is to study information overload in all its facets , we do nt apply any _ a priori _ filter . then , depending on the target of each part of the analysis , we apply ad - hoc filters to fit our specific goals .",
    "each email included the _ sender i d _ , _ receiver i d _ , _ time sent _ , _ subject _ , _ body _ of the email , and number of _ attachments_.",
    "all data were anonymized to preserve user privacy and worked at the level of anonymized user ids and email ids . given the data sensitivity , even with opt - in users , email bodies were not editorially inspected by humans . to extract statistics from email bodies ( length , number of articles , email vectors , email ids in a thread , etc . )",
    ", we made a mapreduce call with a specified function to a protected cluster .        to make sense of the conversation flow , we need to break down the dyadic conversations into _",
    "threads_. a thread is an ordered sequence of one or more emails , including the initial email , and the list of succeeding replies to it ( if any ) . as our dataset",
    "does not keep track of the thread structure , we need to reconstruct it .",
    "we compose the threads using the subject line and the time each email was sent .",
    "yahoo mail automatically adds the token _",
    "`` re : '' _ to the subject line of all replies . for each pair of the users ,",
    "we group all the exchanged emails that have the same subject line .",
    "if all the emails in the group start with `` re : '' , we also add the email that has the exact subject without the `` re : '' ; this email would be the first email of the thread .",
    "then , in each group we order the emails based on the sent time , and the time to replies could be calculated as the delay between the email from one user and the reply of the other user . in case of consecutive replies in one thread from one of the users ,",
    "we just consider the first one ( figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "like most other email service providers , yahoo mail quotes the body of the original message at the end of the reply , unless manually removed . to get only the text of the last email sent , we search for standard string templates that occur before the quoted message , ( e.g. , `` on thursday may 1 , 2014 a@yahoo.com wrote '' ) and exclude any text from that point .",
    "we also looked for common mobile device signatures , such as `` sent from my iphone '' and exclude the text from the signature onwards .",
    "* limitations . *",
    "our data comes with a few limitations .",
    "first , in case of an in - line reply , we would not be able to detect the quoted message , and it would be considered as a new message . the quoted message could be caught by comparison of reply and the email being replied to , but the string matching would be computationally expensive for the scale of our dataset .",
    "second , we are not able to handle the emails that are sent to a group of users , and we consider all the emails as being dyadic . moreover , for constructing the threads , we use the exact subject line and if there are two different threads between two users with the same subject , we will consider both of them as one thread .",
    "we believe these cases are special cases and a small fraction of emails , so our results would not be effected by these limitations .",
    "* one main concern with studying emails is the spam . to minimize the effect of spam , we conduct most of our analyses on dyadic email exchanges that occur between two users who have exchanged at least five emails with each other .",
    "we believe that the fact that two users have exchanged more than five emails means that neither of them is a spammer . in the analysis of the information load on users",
    ", we have to consider all the emails those users received , and many of them could be spam and should not be considered . to deal with this problem , we conduct the analysis once for all the received emails and once for emails received from contacts , i.e. , others with whom the user had exchanged at least one email . again , filtering users who have not received any replies from a user is a very conservative approach to eliminate spammers .

    "* online conversations * were studied extensively in the context of social media , as they are important drivers of user _ engagement _ in online communities  @xcite .",
    "research tried to identify common predictive models of the main traits of human communication .",
    "previous work on twitter investigated the _ conventions _ used to initiate and track conversations  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of conversational _",
    "norms _ in time have been recently studied on flickr and anobii  @xcite .",
    "similar to our study , previous work tried to predict the length of a discussion thread in facebook using time and content features  @xcite .",
    "models to reproduce some statistical properties of threads ( e.g. , size of thread , number of participants ) were tested successfully in twitter and yahoo groups  @xcite .",
    "multimodal features of discussion threads can also predict its perceived interestingness  @xcite .",
    "divergence of topics in twitter group conversations was recently investigated  @xcite .",
    "the propensity to engage in conversation has been investigated under the light of the user personality traits such as openness to new experiences or emotional stability  @xcite .",
    "the emotions conveyed in online conversations were also studied  @xcite .",
    "we believe ours is the first large scale analysis of email conversations and attempt to predict some of their main structural properties .",
    "also , we do not focus on properties of the agents involved in conversations except for some demographic features like age and gender .",
    "* emailing behavior * was studied predominantly on small - scale data and often using qualitative methods .",
    "the attitude of email users towards work email was investigated through organizational surveys  @xcite , finding that the social nature of the message is a stronger motivation to reply than the `` importance '' of the message . also , survey respondents tended to reply to about only a third of the messages in their inbox .",
    "user studies and targeted interviews about rhythms in email usage , including intervals of replying , have uncovered the role of user expectation in relation with the replying behavior  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when a user perceives that the response has been delayed too much , the resulting _ breakdown perception _ triggers a follow - up action in the thread .",
    "quantitative studies targeted to specific application - oriented tasks such as classification of emails into folders  @xcite were conducted mainly on the open enron email data  @xcite , which is one of the few complete temporal data on email communication whose structure has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "however , enron s email communication patterns were very specific as they were limited to the context of the company and by its evolution and dramatic fall .",
    "this peculiarity held back researchers from drawing conclusions on general patterns of email use .",
    "other less known , small - scale email datasets , such as the email corpora from oss projects  @xcite can provide interesting traces on user interaction , but they do not allow any generalization of the findings .",
    "email communication networks have been also used to investigate the propagation of computer viruses  @xcite and word - of - mouth advertising  @xcite , or to solve specific tasks such as expert finding within organizations  @xcite .",
    "information overload in email was studied since the 90 s .",
    "in contrast to whittaker and sidner  @xcite , who defined _ email overload _ as the use of email as a tool for task management , archival , and communication , we follow the definition of overload as not being able to keep up with the volume of incoming email  @xcite . unlike previous qualitative studies that focused on the perception of overload  @xcite , we focus on quantitative measures of overload and its observed effects on users behavior .",
    "while email accounts for a considerable portion of interpersonal communication , emailing behavior is not well understood .",
    "we carried out a large - scale study of email replying behavior of more than 2 m users .",
    "we studied how a variety of factors affects reply time and length .",
    "we found that users reply faster to emails received during weekdays and working hours , and that replies tend to become shorter later in the day and on weekends . in regard to demographics , younger users generally send faster and shorter replies , and men send slightly faster and shorter replies than women . among other factors",
    ", replies from mobile devices were faster and shorter than from desktops , and emails without attachments typically got faster replies .",
    "we investigated the effect of email overload on the replying behavior .",
    "we found that users increased their activity as they received more emails , but not enough to compensate for the higher load .",
    "this means that as users became more overloaded , they replied to a smaller fraction of incoming emails and with shorter replies",
    ". however , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster . demographic factors affected information overload , too .",
    "older users generally replied to a smaller fraction of incoming emails , but their reply time and length were not impacted by overload as much as younger users .",
    "in contrast , younger users replied faster , but with shorter replies and to a higher fraction of emails .",
    "we also studied synchronization of replying behavior within a thread , and found that users tended to become more similar , both in reply time and length , until the middle of a thread .",
    "after that , their behavior became less similar .",
    "we also tested for coordination of linguistic styles using a variety of markers .",
    "results were inconclusive : some markers suggested linguistic style coordination , but this was not the case for all .",
    "finally , to measure the predictive power of considered factors , we built classifiers to predict the time and length of replies , and whether an email was the last one in a thread .",
    "we obtained accuracy of 58.8% , 71.8% , and 65.9% for these tasks , which represented a relative improvement of 67.1% , 113.7% , and 30.2% respectively over the baselines .",
    "our classifiers could be used to improve email client applications , to better classify and rank emails ."
