    "the study by ulvestad & wilson ( @xcite ) revealed a slightly elongated structure in their vla map ( @xmath45=6 cm ) of ngc1386 at the p.a .",
    "so the radio  emission points anti - parallel to the optical emission . however , a more recent investigation by nagar et al .",
    "( @xcite ) revealed a 300pc extended feature in p.a .",
    "@xmath102 in their vla @xmath103 cm map .",
    "a further interesting result of our analysis is the detection of the bright component ( cloud a ) which is displaced by @xmath52 from the nucleus . in the study by weaver et al .",
    "( @xcite ) they reported a displacement of the optical nucleus by @xmath104 from their kinematical studies ( kinematical center ) , which is most likely coincident with cloud a in our investigation .",
    "the true nucleus of ngc1386 has a much less apparent luminosity than cloud a , and hence is most likely highly absorbed .",
    "this is also evidenced by x",
    " ray observations ( maiolino et al .",
    "we conclude that component a is excited by photoionization , as is evident from the measured line ratios .",
    "the fact that there is a cone  like geometry of the nlr on small scales , hints that absorption plays a role on those scales and that effect implies that the ionizing radiation can not escape isotropically from the circumnuclear regions .",
    "the observation of cone  like geometries in the central regions of seyfert galaxies is a common feature .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that the nlr in ngc1068 is cone  like and comprises of several components .",
    "the kinematics of the strong components of this cloud ensemble have been studied by dietrich & wagner ( @xcite ) .",
    "at least @xmath10516 components are visible in their @xmath46map obtained for the [ ] @xmath455007  line down to the scale of @xmath106 that reside in the central @xmath89 region . from their study",
    "it was inferred that the velocity field of ngc1068 is driven by shocks due to the interaction of the radio jet with the ambient medium .",
    "we have studied the kinematics and the morphology of the nlr in the seyfert galaxy ngc1386 with high spatial resolution with caspec and archival hst images .",
    "the following results have been obtained .    *",
    "the nlr of ngc1386 is composed of 9 individual components with 5 components being redshifted and 4 being blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity . *",
    "the brightest component ( cloud a ) is blueshifted by @xmath107 and shows an offset of @xmath108 to the south . *",
    "this cloud a is identified with the brightest region in the hst image , and is excited by photoionization * the true nucleus ngc1386 has a much lower apparent luminosity , and is possibly hidden by nuclear dust lanes .",
    "* there is evidence for a two component velocity field in ngc1386    the results show that with this technique of sub  arcsecond mapping , which makes use of highly resolved 2-d spectra , it is possible to identify individual nlr components in the nearest seyfert galaxies . in this respect",
    "it is a powerful tool to describe the kinematics and morphology of the nlr .",
