    "the two branches starting on the real axis leave it at @xmath243 and @xmath244 respectively , as can be seen from the plot of the imaginary part of @xmath26 in figure [ legendre_reim ] ; the plots of the corresponding real parts have each a cusp at the same time , due to the inversion of the direction of motion of @xmath26 .",
    "the plot in figure [ legendre_conv ] shows exponential convergence of @xmath26 to @xmath35 setting in soon after all three branches leave the real line .",
    "the black reference line with slope @xmath245 represents the bound from theorem [ main - geom ] , the intercept is chosen so that the line is superimposed on the numerical data . in this example ( as well as in subsequent examples with measures having no gaps ) we see that the estimate of the convergence rate in theorem [ main - geom ] is sharp and consequently can not be improved in general . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimate is not always sharp , cf .",
    "example [ jumping3 ] .",
    "we have already mentioned that the points @xmath26 arrange themselves regularly on branches .",
    "this behavior is common to most of our examples , except the cases when @xmath35 is on the real axis , where because of proposition [ 3.2 ] there is one branch only .",
    "since the branches appear to approach @xmath35 isotropically , as can be e.g. seen in the zoomed picture of figure [ legendre_compl ] , this suggests a convenient way of calculating the numerical value of @xmath35 as the mean @xmath246 where @xmath247 denotes the number of branches and @xmath248 the last @xmath63 for which @xmath26 is calculated .",
    "the value of @xmath35 obtained taking the average of the three last points ( one for each branch ) equals @xmath249 , which agrees well with the value @xmath250 obtained solving with mathematica @xcite eq . .",
    "we conclude noting that here and in all our other examples the real axis forms a barrier for @xmath26 : it never crosses it and branches which touch it get stuck in it ; this is clearly visible in the movie legendre_spirals_a_0.5.avi that can be found among the supplementary files to this paper @xcite .",
    "this behavior is related to the symmetry of the spectrum with respect to the real axis .",
    "if we now keep @xmath240 constant and vary @xmath104 to assume the values @xmath251 , and @xmath252 , in all cases the @xmath26 s arrange themselves over three spiraling branches and the value @xmath35 obtained from the average of the last three values of @xmath26 agrees with the one calculated solving eq . with mathematica to the last digit shown in table [ table ] . in all cases convergence is exponential and the slope of logarithmic plots similar to that in figure [ legendre_conv ] are in agreement with the value @xmath245 from theorem [ main - geom ] ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "there are some case to case differences , but they do not affect the picture given above : for @xmath253 the three branches are not clearly visible , due to the very fast convergence of @xmath26 ; for @xmath254 only one branch spends some time on the real axis , up to @xmath255 ; and for @xmath256 even after 1000 iterations one of the three branches has not yet left the real axis ( for figures see the supplementary material @xcite ) .",
    "our last example with measure eq .",
    "is a case when @xmath257 $ ] : if we take @xmath258 and @xmath259 we get @xmath260 ( mathematica has problems solving eq . in this case ) .",
    "the values of @xmath26 are all real ; we therefore have a single branch .",
    "convergence is again exponential ( for figures see the supplementary material @xcite ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare this case to the case @xmath240 , @xmath261 : the distance of @xmath35 from the interval @xmath229 $ ] is of the same order , but the convergence is much faster in the present case .",
    "this is due to the different eccentricities of the ellipses from theorem [ main - geom ] : in the present case the eccentricity is smaller , and therefore @xmath201 is larger and in consequence the convergence rate is better .",
    "finally , in figure [ ns ] we summarize the convergence behavior when submatrix @xmath67 corresponds to measure eq .",
    ": we vary the parameters @xmath262 and @xmath263 and for each pair @xmath264 we compute the value @xmath50 where the last @xmath26 branch leaves the real axis .",
    "each pair @xmath264 determines a single point @xmath35 in the upper half - plane , which we plot color coded according to @xmath50 .",
    "the figure appears to have a fractal character for which we do not yet have an explanation but which we suspect to be related to the way the number of @xmath26 branches varies with varying @xmath103 .",
    "this can be seen in the movie legendre_spirals_b_0.01.avi @xcite where we keep @xmath265 and vary @xmath103 .",
    "we instead observe no change in the number of branches when varying @xmath104 at constant @xmath103 ( see e.g. the movie legendre_spirals_a_0.5.avi @xcite ) .    as we have already mentioned , branches are a common occurrence , not limited to the example just given . we give here a couple more examples .",

    "note due to remark [ gaps ] we again have @xmath48=[-2,2]$ ] .    in figure [ wigner_compl ]",
    "it is possible to see that the @xmath26 s form twelve branches . knowing this",

    "the video wigner_spirals_b_0.01.avi in @xcite shows the evolution of the @xmath26 branches under the change of the parameter @xmath103 . as in example [ jumping ] , it is evident that here too the number of branches changes with @xmath103 . looking at the first few frames of the movie it is also evident that there are branches that start off the real axis , hit it and instead of continuing into @xmath266 get trapped in it moving horizontally for a number of @xmath63 , and then leave it when the spiral reenters @xmath76 .",
    "[ jumping3 ]    here we present an example of a different nature .",

    "we could count @xmath267 branches of @xmath26 ; such a high number is hardly visible when plotting @xmath26 in the complex plane but can be seen in the plot of @xmath268 in figure [ cantor_conv ] : the @xmath26 s form regular clusters of @xmath267 points .",
    "what is particularly noteworthy is that contrary to the previous examples the convergence rate is faster than the one predicted by theorem [ main - geom ] , as can be seen comparing the theoretical bound ( black line ) with the numerical points in figure [ cantor_conv ] .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the spectrum of @xmath67 contains gaps .",
    "other pictures corresponding to this example ( called cantor_a_0.5_b_0.1_xxx.eps ) , as well as the video cantor_spirals_b_0.2.avi showing the evolution of branches under the change of the parameter @xmath103 , can be found in the supplementary files @xcite : again the number of branches changes with @xmath103 ; moreover intervals in @xmath103 where both @xmath35 and all the @xmath26 become real are evident and correspond to the gaps in @xmath67 , see remark [ gaps ] .",
    "although theorem [ main - geom ] proves the exponential rate of convergence of @xmath26 to @xmath35 , it does not say when this convergence starts manifesting itself : at least in theory we could have @xmath269 for some @xmath63 .",
