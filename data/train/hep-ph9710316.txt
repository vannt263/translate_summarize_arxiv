    "a fundamental issue in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the behavior of the strong interaction running coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the basic research tool is perturbation theory ( pt ) with its renormalization - group improvement  @xcite . in the qcd case in the limit of large momentum transfers",
    "@xmath1 , this approach provides a logarithmic decrease of the running coupling constant @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the qcd scale parameter that determines where the theory becomes asymptotically free .",
    "the study of the behavior of @xmath4 outside of the asymptotic region is more difficult .",
    "it is known that the direct use of pt improved by the renormalization group leads to infrared instability of @xmath4 and unphysical singularities , for instance , a ghost pole at @xmath5 .",
    "unphysical singularities of a perturbative running coupling constant precludes a self - consistent determination of the effective coupling constant for timelike momentum transfers .",
    "recently , a new method has been proposed @xcite for constructing the qcd running coupling constant in such a way as to retain the correct analytic properties .",
    "this method is called analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze the region of timelike momentum transfers on the basis of apt @xcite , and compare the results of the pt and apt approaches .",
    "it is well known that a theoretical description of important timelike processes such as @xmath6 annihilation into hadrons , or of decay widths of the @xmath7-lepton and @xmath8-boson into hadrons , requires analytic continuation of the running coupling constant from the spacelike ( euclidean ) region of momentum transfers ( @xmath9 ) into the timelike ( physical ) region ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "although this problem has been studied since the 1970 s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it still remains a subject of great interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious that information on the running coupling constant obtained from timelike processes , for instance , from @xmath6 annihilation into hadrons , corresponds to knowledge of the coupling constant extracted from spacelike processes such as deep inelastic scattering , if the transition from the euclidean into the physical region is performed in a correct manner ( see  @xcite ) without violation of analytic properties of the hadronic correlator @xmath11 and the adler function @xmath12 . when the analytic properties are not respected , the question arises : to what extent does this breaking of analyticity influence quantities extracted from physical processes ?",
    "it is impossible to answer this question within the framework of standard perturbation theory . on the other hand",
    ", the apt method retains the correct analytic properties of the adler @xmath13-function and , in addition , gives simple analytic expressions that can be compared with corresponding pt expressions and , therefore , allows quantitative analysis of the influence that the breaking of @xmath14-analyticity has on the running coupling constant .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the following section , we discuss the procedure of analytic continuation from the spacelike ( euclidean ) to the timelike ( @xmath15-channel ) region . in sec .",
    "iii we examine this procedure in the conventional one - loop pt approach , and demonstrate that it is inconsistent . in sec .",
    "iv we resolve this problem through the apt approach , and in sec .",
    "v we compare the results of these two schemes .",
    "we move on to two - loops in sec .",
    "vi , and demonstrate the stability of the apt approach . a matching procedure for timelike momentum transfers",
    "is given in sec .",
    "vii , where we show how the coupling constant depends on the number of active flavors .",
    "a summary of our results is given in the conclusions .",
    "first , we note that in the standard approach , the running coupling constant in qcd as a function of @xmath14 is determined by the renormalization - group analysis in the region of spacelike momentum transfers .",
    "however , to parametrize many physical processes , one needs to know the coupling constant in the timelike region . to be specific , many experimentally measured ratios @xmath16 , where , e.g. , @xmath17 , can be written in the form @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is a qcd correction and @xmath20 represents the parton level of description of a given process with electroweak corrections .",
    "@xmath21 can be expressed through the imaginary part of the hadronic correlator @xmath22 . to parametrize @xmath23 in terms of qcd parameters , a special procedure of analytic continuation",
    "is required . with that end in view ,",
    "one usually employs a dispersion relation @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and the inverse relation @xmath26 where the contour joins points @xmath27 and lies in the region of analyticity of the function @xmath28 , going around the cut @xmath29 .",
    "we define the effective coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , in the spacelike ( @xmath32-channel ) and timelike ( @xmath15-channel ) regions , using the notation @xmath33 and dimensionless ( in units of the scaling parameter @xmath3 ) momentum variables , by @xmath34 relations ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) and the equality @xmath35 result in the connection between these effective coupling constants @xmath36 therefore , the qcd corrections @xmath19 for the class of physical processes considered with timelike momentum transfers are to be parametrized , according to eq .",

    "therefore , the connection between @xmath32- and @xmath15-channel running coupling constants , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is defined by equations like ( [ as0 ] ) and ( [ at0 ] ) . in the one - loop approximation",
    "the effective coupling constants coincide with the running coupling constants and in higher loops , the connection depends on the physical process .",
    "consider the above procedure of analytic continuation within pt . in the one - loop approximation ,",
    "the running coupling constant is of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the one - loop coefficient of the @xmath43-function corresponding to @xmath44 active quarks . inserting eq .",
    "( [ a1z ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ as0 ] ) we obtain the following expression for the running coupling constant in @xmath15-channel @xmath45 this expression is physically meaningless , because it is negative for any @xmath15 and does not have the correct asymptotics , that is , going as @xmath46 as @xmath47 ; the reason will be explained below .    there is another way of calculating @xmath48 , based on the shankar method  @xcite . using analyticity of the @xmath13-function in the complex @xmath49-plane with the cut along the positive real axis",

[ circle ] ) , to an integral around a circle of radius @xmath51 in the complex @xmath49-plane , contour @xmath52 , parametrized by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , to arrive the expression @xmath55 this is positive when @xmath56 and possesses the correct ultraviolet asymptotics .",

    "thus , a formal conversion of the pt one - loop running coupling constant in the spacelike region  ( [ a1z ] ) into expressions for the coupling constant in the timelike region leads to contradictory results ( [ raz1 ] ) and ( [ cont1 ] ) .",

    "( [ cont1 ] ) is due to an unphysical ghost pole in eq .",
    "( [ a1z ] ) at @xmath62 that violates the required analytic properties of the running coupling constant .",

    "vi . therefore",
    ", keeping to standard pt approximations that violate the necessary analytic properties of the running coupling constant makes it impossible to pass into the timelike region in a self - consistent way .",
    "this can , for instance , be demonstrated by making an inverse transition from the timelike into the spacelike region with the help the dispersion relation  ( [ d2 ] ) . substituting the running coupling constant @xmath40 given by eq .",

    "the problem of how to make the correct transition between the space- and timelike regions can be solved in the framework of the apt method @xcite that ensures the correct analytic properties of the coupling constant without introducing extra parameters .",

    "when one employs the analytic coupling constant ( [ aan1 ] ) , both methods of calculating @xmath48 considered above produce the same result , i.e. @xmath67 we note that apt and pt give distinct values for the running coupling constant in the timelike region , for example , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by eq .",
    "( [ raz1 ] ) .",
    "consistency of the apt approach also follows from the fact that we can reconstruct the initial expression ( [ aan1 ] ) when the timelike coupling ( [ exact1 ] ) is substituted into eq .",
    "( [ at0 ] ) .",
    "it is of interest to note that this consistency is due to the second term in eq .",

    "( [ a1z ] ) . therefore the pt expression ( [ a1z ] ) gives the same result as the apt approach in the timelike region for @xmath73 if the contour @xmath52 is used .",
    "however , there is no inverse correspondence for pt [ see formula ( [ newa1z ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , note that an equality analogous to eq .",
    "( [ equ ] ) does not arise if the integrand contains the running coupling constant multiplied by a function of @xmath49 .",

    "intermediate and , especially , at low momentum transfers it is important to take account of the correct analytic properties of @xmath197 , which permits a consistent transition into the timelike region .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath197 is essentially different from the dependence of @xmath4 in pt .",
    "our analysis shows that the popular pt expressions for @xmath4 as expansions in @xmath198 , containing nonphysical singularities , do not allow a self - consistent interpretation of information obtained from different experiments on the evolution of @xmath4 outside of the asymptotic region . from our numerical estimates",
    "it follows that analyticity of the running coupling constant has great influence on the value of the parameter @xmath199 extracted from experimental data and on the @xmath14-evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "note that these considerations are also important for the investigation of power corrections , which are now under intensive study ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of power corrections in the apt scheme relative to perturbative terms naturally will be different than in the conventional approach .",
    "as in pt , the influence of quark thresholds results in a reduction of the scale parameter @xmath3 as the number of active flavors @xmath44 increases .",
    "however , the importance of maintaining the correct analytic structure suggests that the required matching be made in the physical region .",
    "the apt method appears to be fruitful for studying the problem of analytic continuation of @xmath4 into the timelike region .",
    "there is no doubt that extracting more detailed information from experimental data on timelike processes requires a more thorough theoretical analysis within apt including the estimation of the contributions from higher order processes , mass corrections , and so on .",
    "these will be considered in our subsequent papers .",
