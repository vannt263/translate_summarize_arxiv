    "chiral perturbation theory @xcite provides a successful description of the goldstone boson sector of qcd ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . a straightforward power counting , i.e. correspondence between the loop expansion and the chiral expansion in terms of momenta and quark masses at a fixed ratio @xcite , is obtained by using dimensional regularization in combination with the modified minimal subtraction scheme . therefore , a systematic and controllable improvement is possible in perturbative calculations of physical quantities at low energies .",
    "the construction of a consistent power counting in effective field theories with heavy degrees of freedom turns out to be a more complex problem .",
    "for example , power counting is violated in baryon chiral perturbation theory if dimensional regularization and the minimal subtraction scheme are applied @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , the inclusion of heavier baryon resonances such as the roper resonance requires a non - trivial generalization . in this case the problem of power counting can be solved by using the complex - mass scheme ( cms ) @xcite which can be understood as an extension of the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme to unstable particles . in previous papers",

    "the integration over classical fields corresponding to particles is performed in the standard way , i.e. , the gaussian part is treated non - perturbatively and the rest perturbatively . in particular ,",
    "the functional integral is performed for both stable and unstable degrees of freedom .",
    "for stable particles the path integral formalism is equivalent to the operator formalism based on the dirac interaction representation .",
    "unfortunately , it is not obvious how to apply this representation to field operators for unstable particles , because , strictly speaking , there is no free hamiltonian for unstable particles .",
    "therefore , we stick to the functional integral where one can perform the integration independently of the nature of the field .    in the following ,",
    "we apply the cms to have a consistent power counting also applicable to loop diagrams .",
    "this renormalization scheme is realized by splitting the bare parameters ( and fields ) of the lagrangian into , in general , complex renormalized parameters and counter terms .",
    "we choose the renormalized masses as the poles of the dressed propagators in the chiral limit : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the complex pole of the roper propagator in the chiral limit , @xmath60 is the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit , and @xmath61 is the complex pole of the @xmath1 propagator in the chiral limit . we include the renormalized parameters @xmath53 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 in the propagators and treat the counter terms perturbatively .",
    "the renormalized couplings @xmath41 and @xmath42 of @xmath63 are chosen such that the corresponding counter terms exactly cancel the power - counting - violating parts of the loop diagrams .    while the starting point is a hermitian lagrangian in terms of bare parameters and fields , the cms involves complex parameters in the basic lagrangian and complex counter terms .",
    "although the application of the cms seems to violate unitarity , the bare lagrangian is unchanged and unitarity can not be violated in the complete theory . on the other hand , it is not obvious that the approximate expressions to the @xmath64-matrix generated by perturbation theory also satisfy the unitarity condition since the conventional cutkosky cutting equations @xcite are not valid in the framework of cms .",
    "however , it is possible to derive generalized cutting rules for loop integrals involving propagators with complex masses to show that unitarity is satisfied perturbatively @xcite . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath64-matrix connecting stable states only is unitary .",

    "in addition , we assign the order @xmath68 to the @xmath1 propagator and to the roper propagator . within the cms",
    ", such a power counting is respected by the renormalized loop diagrams in the range of energies close to the roper mass . in practice",
    ", we implement this scheme by subtracting the loop diagrams at complex  on - mass - shell  points in the chiral limit .",
    "when calculating an observable , we do not perform an expansion in powers of the mass differences between the roper and the nucleon or the roper and the @xmath1 .",
    "rather we calculate the chiral corrections to the magnetic moment of the roper as a series in powers of the pion mass which is either divided by large scales , like @xmath70 and the heavy masses , or multiplied by coupling constants which contain ( inverse powers of ) hidden large scales . as the omitted neighboring resonances , like @xmath71 , couple weakly to the roper resonance , inverse powers of small scales ( mass differences between the roper and the omitted resonances ) which are hidden in low - energy coupling constants of our effective theory are enhanced by inverse powers of small couplings ( corresponding to the weak coupling of the roper resonance to its neighbors ) and therefore effectively appear as large scales .    the dressed propagator of the roper can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the sum of one - particle - irreducible diagrams contributing to the roper two - point function .",
    "the pole of the dressed propagator @xmath74 is obtained by solving the equation @xmath75 we define the pole mass and the width as the real part and @xmath76 times the imaginary part of the pole @xcite , respectively , @xmath77 some of the phenomenological analyses and dynamical models describe the roper as a double - pole structure ( see , e.g. , refs .",
