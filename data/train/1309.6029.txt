    "recently , the cdms collaboration reports that three wimp - candidate events were observed  @xcite by using the silicon detectors . with a final surface - event background estimate of @xmath6 , they indicate that the highest likelihood occurs for a wimp mass of 8.6 gev/@xmath7 and spin - independent wimp - nucleon cross section of @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "this observation seems to contradict with the results of xenon100 @xcite .",
    "hooper @xcite re - analyzed the data of xenon100 and reached a different conclusion , namely the two experimental results can be reconciled .",
    "therefore in this work , we take the cdms results as inputs to study the dark matter",
    ". we will test a viable model proposed in literature , namely check whether both the astronomical observation and constraints from the collider experiments can be simultaneously satisfied in this scenario .    as is well known",
    ", none of the standard model ( sm ) particles can meet the criterion to stand as dark matter ( dm ) candidates .",
    "many particles beyond the sm are proposed , for example the primordial black holes , axions , heavy neutrinos , the lightest supersymmetric neutralino , etc . among them , the darkon model namely a sm singlet scalar @xcite which interacts with the sm particles by exchanging higgs boson only , probably is the simplest version for the dark matter candidates .",
    "the spin - independent cross section for the darkon - nucleon elastic scattering might be measured by the earth detectors .",
    "the typical recoil energy is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is dark matter - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath12 is dm velocity , and @xmath13 is target nucleus mass .",
    "the wimps with not very heavy masses will weaken the bounds in detector search , and the low mass wimps ( mass around 10 gev ) are more of our concern in this work .",
    "thanks to the successful operation of lhc where the higgs boson signals have been observed @xcite , it provides a possible means to directly detect the dark matter particles on the earth if they indeed exist .",
    "it means that all the proposed dark matter candidates and possible new interactions by which the dm particles interfere with our detector would withstand the stringent test on the earth colliders .",
    "namely , if the proposed dm particles , especially the lighter ones , are not observed at lhc as expected , the concerned model fails or needs to be modified .",
    "as indicates in  @xcite , if the mass of the darkon is lighter than half of higgs mass , higgs would decay into a darkon pair which is a channel with invisible final products , and the simplest version of scalar darkon+sm may fail .",
    "that is to say , if darkon s coupling to higgs is not much smaller than 1 , a large partial width is expected and it obviously contradicts to the measured value of the invisible width of the sm higgs . as a possible extension of the scalar darkon+sm version ,",
    "the two - higgs - doublet model was discussed in  @xcite and there seems to be a large parameter space to accommodate both the lhc data on higgs and the cdms observations .",
    "we also find that the scenario of darkon+sm , no matter the darkon is scalar , fermionic or vector , definitely fails , thus a new interaction beyond the sm is needed .",
    "alternatively , we propose an interaction beyond the sm as the darkon+sm+an extra @xmath1 .",
    "the extended gauge group @xmath0 breaks into @xmath2 and two neutral bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 are resulted in . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are mixtures of @xmath14 and @xmath15 which is the gauge boson of the newly introduced @xmath1 , while the photon remains massless . in this scenario , to be consistent with the cdms and lhc data simultaneously , we should assume that the coupling between the darkon and higgs boson to be very small and the interaction by exchanging higgs between the detector material and darkon can be safely ignored .",
    "therefore , the possible decays of higgs boson into darkons are almost forbidden and one can not expect to measure the mode at lhc at all .",
    "the scattering between the darkon and nucleons is due to exchanging the gauge boson @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "definitely , such interaction may also exist in the decays of quarkonia , i.e. if the measurement of heavy quarkonia , such as bottomonia , are very precise , one may observe their decays into invisible final products besides the sm neutrino - anti - neutrino pairs .",
    "but it is estimated that the branching ratios for such decays of heavy quarkonia are too small to be reliably measured in any of our present facilities .",
    "besides , when the bottomonia are lighter than the new invisible final products , these decays are also forbidden .",
    "therefore this proposed darkon+sm+@xmath1 is safe with respect to the present experimental constraints .",
    "moreover , the observed relic density of dark matter in our universe sets one more constraint on our model parameter space .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we first consider the simple version of scalar , fermionic , and vector darkon within the framework of standard model plus darkon , then we derive the formulas of the cross section between nucleon and darkon , as well as the decay width of higgs into invisible darkons .",
    "we further derive the corresponding formulas for the aforementioned extended version darkon+sm+@xmath1 . then in the following section , we numerically evaluate the cross sections of darkon - nucleon elastic scattering with the two scenarios .",
    "we indicate that the simple version does not satisfy the constraint set by the lhc data as long as we take the cdms data as inputs , but in the extended version there is a parameter space to accommodate both the experimental measurements .",
    "the last section is devoted to our brief summary and discussions .",
    "in this work , as cdms data suggested , we focus on low mass wimps",
    ". the wimp particle could be an @xmath16 singlet , i.e. either a scalar or fermion or vector darkon @xcite . in the scenario of darkon+sm , the elastic scatting between darkon and the detector material",
    "is realized via t - channel higgs exchange , as described in fig .",
    "[ fig - scatt ] .",
    ", width=288 ]      let us consider a scalar type wimp dm , namely a scalar darkon first .",
    "this type dm has been discussed in  @xcite , and here for completeness we first repeat some relevant procedures .",
    "the lagrangian is written as  @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are free parameters to be determined by fitting data .",
    "it has been indicated in earlier works that the scalar darkon field has no mixing with the higgs field , and this can avoid fast decaying into sm particles because dark matter particles must be sufficiently stable and survive from the big bang to today . from eq .",
    "( [ eqs1 ] ) , the sm singlet scalar darkon can be further written as @xmath21 the higgs - nucleon coupling @xmath22 is needed in calculating the scatting process , @xmath23 @xmath24 . here",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath22 given by he et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the cross - section of scalar dm - nucleon elastic scatting is @xcite @xmath27 here , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the momenta of the initial dm and nucleon . for low energy elastic scatting , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",
    "are masses of dm , nucleon respectively . substituting the darkon mass 8.6 gev and the cross section @xmath8 @xmath9 as given by cdms",
    "ii into the above formula ( [ s - cs ] ) , we can fix the effective coupling of higgs - darkon .",
    "the higgs signals have been observed at lhc  @xcite and @xmath32 125 gev , so by the data of cdms , @xmath33 is determined .",
    "the partial width of higgs decaying into two scalar darkons is @xmath34 substituting higgs mass into the equation , @xmath35 gev is obtained .",
    "the main decay channel in sm is @xmath36 . in the born approximation ,",
    "the width of this channel is @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the fermi coupling constant . with @xmath39=1.166@xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we can obtain @xmath42 gev .",
    "thus the branching ratio @xmath43 would be too large .      in the spin-@xmath44 darkon+sm scenario ,",
    "the effective interaction can be written as @xmath45 the cross - section of the low energy fermion - darkon - nucleon elastic scatting is @xmath46 the partial width of higgs decaying into two darkon spinors is @xmath47 in this case , the invisible decay width is unbearably large when @xmath20 is at order of unity .",
    "it means that such spin-@xmath48 darkon+sm scenario must also be abandoned .    for a vector darkon",
    ", the effective lagrangian can be written as @xmath49 the cross section of the elastic scattering between a vector darkon and nucleon via a higgs boson exchange is @xmath50    the numerical results for the vector darkon are similar to the two above cases for scalar and fermion darkons , namely with the darkons possessing a low mass of order of 10 gev and the spin - independent cross section as determined by the cdms data , the partial width of higgs decaying into invisible final products would be too large to be tolerated .",
    "the above results indicate that the simplest scenario of darkon+sm , no matter the sm singlet darkon is a scalar , fermion or vector , can not reconcile the cosmological observation of cdms and the lhc data",
    ". then one should invoke an extended version of sm i.e. a darkon+sm+bsm scenario .",
    "but what model beyond standard model ( bsm ) which can be applied to explain the cdms observation and the lhc data simultaneously , is a problem",
    ". there are many different proposals , and below we will investigate a naturally extended version of the sm , i.e. introducing an extra @xmath1 gauge field which would be broken and a new vector boson @xmath4 is induced .",
    "for low mass darkon model , the simple version darkon+sm where darkons interact with the sm particles in detector by exchanging higgs boson at t - channel , definitely fails to reconcile the observation of cdms and lhc data , and therefore needs to be modified . to tolerate the cdms and lhc data , besides the two - higgs - doublet model mentioned above , alternatively , for example , the sneutrino dark matter which interacts with the detector material dominantly via exchanging sm z - boson , was discussed in  @xcite .    in this work , we would study the effects of an extended sm by adding an extra @xmath1  @xcite which only interacts with the darkons ( no matter scalar , fermion or vector darkons ) into the gauge group , as @xmath0 whose gauge bosons are respectively @xmath51 and @xmath15 ( for more discussions about this model , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the extended symmetry later breaks into @xmath2 . as a consequence , besides the regular charged @xmath52 , two neutral gauge bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 gain masses after the symmetry breaking while the photon remains massless .",
    "it is noted that a small mixing between the sm @xmath53 and @xmath54 results in the physical mass eigenstates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the mixing is required to be very small the resultant @xmath55 is almost the sm z boson whereas @xmath4 is overwhelmingly dominated by @xmath54 . concretely , after @xmath56 breaking , one has @xmath57",

    "w_\\mu^3 \\\\",
    "x_{\\mu } \\end{array } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming @xmath15 of @xmath1 only couples to the darkon but not the sm particle whereas @xmath58 only couples to the sm particles , thus the interaction between the darkon and sm particles must be realized via the small mixing .",
    "namely the effective interaction amplitude between the darkon and protons or neutrons in the earth detector must be proportional to @xmath59 . to be consistent with experiments",
    ", @xmath60 should be very small , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "since the new effective vertex @xmath62 is a coupling between scalar , fermionic or vector darkon with the gauge boson , the lorentz structure are well determined even though the coupling constants might be model dependent .",
    "feytsis and ligeti @xcite listed all possible operators and indicated which one(s ) is suppressed by @xmath63 or @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the exchanged momentum and @xmath12 is the speed of the dark matter relative to the earth detector .",
    "thus , in this work , we only concern the unsuppressed spin - independent scattering processes which may correspond to the recently observed events .",
    "below , we will be focusing on the fermionic darkon and give all the details , but for completeness we also briefly discuss the cases for the scalar and vector darkons .",
    "let us consider the fermionic darkon first .",
    "the axial - vector component of the gauge boson may induce a fermionic darkon - nucleon interaction which is not suppressed by @xmath63 or @xmath64 , even though this coupling would result in a spin - dependent cross section @xcite .",
    "for easily handling , here we consider a right - handed darkon with the vertex @xmath66 to interact with the sm particles via exchanging z - boson .",
    "the darkon - nucleon elastic scattering cross section is calculated for two cases : @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , and corresponding dm relic density is also computed .      in this case , the darkon - nucleon elastic scattering occurs mainly via exchanging @xmath3 .",
    "the fugacity speed of wimp is about @xmath70 km / s @xcite . for the low energy @xmath3-nucleon interaction ,",

    ", we can set the values of the form factors at @xmath84 . at @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xcite . in the limit of @xmath84 ,",
    "the parameters corresponding to the strange part are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88  @xcite , and here we take the fitted results @xmath89 , ( @xmath90 at 13 dof )  @xcite .",
    "the pdg average value of @xmath91 is @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "so at @xmath84 , the form factors are @xmath93 for proton ( neutron ) , and @xmath94 @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) for proton ( neutron ) .",
    "the contribution from @xmath75 term is suppressed at @xmath84 .",
    "if considering the conservation of the vector currents and just using the valence quarks in the nucleon , the same result can be obtained for the vector form factor @xmath97 .",
    "as the darkon is non - relativistic , in the limit @xmath98 , the darkon - nucleon elastic scattering cross section with @xmath3 exchanged at t - channel can be written as @xmath99 it is noted that @xmath100 is spin - dependent ( sd ) , and @xmath97 is spin - independent ( si ) . for large mass target nuclei , such as the silicon , germanium and xenon targets ,",
    "the spin - independent interaction is enhanced by the atomic number @xmath101 ( but not exactly , see below for details ) in the target nucleus , so the spin - independent interaction is more sensitive than the spin - dependent case , as discussed in ref .",
    "thus we can drop the spin - dependent term @xmath100 but just keep the spin - independent term @xmath97 for large mass target nuclei scattering . for proton , @xmath102 @xmath103 , while for neutron @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the darkon - neutron scattering is dominant and the scattering cross section of darkon - nucleus via exchanging a neutral gauge boson @xmath53 should be proportional to @xmath105 instead of @xmath101 .",
    "thus a factor of about 0.25 might exist and when analyzing the data to extract the information about the dark matter - nucleon interaction , this factor should be considered .    substituting the cdms ii results for darkon - neutron elastic scattering : @xmath106 gev/@xmath7 and the elastic cross section @xmath107 @xmath9 into the relevant formulas , we obtain @xmath108 . to require the coupling constant @xmath109 ,",

    "it is assumed in our scenario , that subtracting the main contribution of neutrinos from the measured width , the rest can be attributed to the darkon products .",

    "taking the recent new results of the cdms ii experiments searching for wimps with masses of order 10 gev as inputs and considering some constraints from lhc , lep and astronomical observation etc .",
    "altogether , we discuss a simple wimp candidate : the darkon which can be scalar , fermion or vector .",
    "we have found that in the simplest scenario of the standard model plus a sm singlet dm ( the darkon ) , one can not simultaneously satisfy the cdms ii s observation and the lhc data , and this result is consistent with the former result implied in  @xcite .",
    "thus , one must extend the sm to include new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "here we consider the extended gauge group @xmath0 which later breaks into @xmath2 to result in two heavy neutral gauge bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the darkon+sm+@xmath1 scenario must undergo stringent tests from the cosmology observation and the lhc data .",
    "namely , all the cdms ii results , dark matter density in our universe and the data of @xmath3 decaying into invisible products which were obtained by lep experiments must not conflict .",
    "our numerical results indicate that in this scenario , only if @xmath4 is lighter than @xmath3 , all the constraints can be satisfied . under this assumption ,",
    "the model darkon+sm+@xmath1 withstand all the constraints set by the presently available data .",
    "moreover , it is noted that as long as @xmath188 , the model can accommodate even smaller scattering cross section and lighter darkons .    indeed we should further test the validity of this mechanism .",
    "if in the future , we can precisely measure the branching ratios of heavy quarkonia , such as botomonia decaying into invisible products , or the invisible decays of the sm z boson and higgs sector physics , we would be able to determine which one e.g. , of the two - higgs - doublets mechanism or the extra @xmath1 gauge group , is more reasonable .",
    "we lay hope on the future more precise detection on the dark matter , no matter direct or indirect .    in the world today there are many laboratories directly searching for dark matter besides the xenon and cdms collaborations , for example , the china jin - ping underground laboratory @xcite just joined the club and the china dark - matter experiment ( cdex ) is using 1 kg ge detector and will develop 10 kg and 1 ton detector for the project .",
    "we are expecting that the world - wide cooperation can eventually reveal the epoch mystery .",
