    "traceable temperature measurements need an internationally accepted reference . for practical measurements of temperature in accord with the international system of units ( si ) international temperature scales are available - the international temperature scale of 1990 ( its-90 ) @xcite and the provisional low temperature scale of 2000 ( plts-2000 ) @xcite .",
    "the scale definitions and the supplementary documents issued by the bureau international des poids et mesures ( bipm ) @xcite provide detailed information on the realization of the its-90 and plts-2000 as well as the uncertainties which can be reached .",
    "however , recent developments in thermometry calling for a more flexible approach have resulted in the adoption of the  mise en pratique for the definition of the kelvin  by the comit consultatif de thermomtrie ( cct ) of the bipm .",
    "this document @xcite summarizes all information for practical temperature measurements in accord with the si .",
    "importantly , also primary thermometers for direct measurements of temperature now can be included in the  mise en pratique  provided an assessment of the uncertainties for those measurements exists .",
    "investigation of mesoscopic and nanoscopic objects has made large progress during the last decade .",
    "along with an increased understanding of such structures , improved production technologies made new classes of thermometers available @xcite .",
    "as an example , thermometers based on a tunnel junction or arrays of them as the coulomb blockade thermometer ( cbt ) @xcite , the single junction thermometer ( sjt ) @xcite or the shot noise thermometer ( snt ) @xcite have been shown to work in a broad temperature range .",
    "the mentioned thermometers can be operated in primary mode because the measured quantity is in these devices directly linked to temperature without any need of a calibration against a temperature scale or reference . in combination with their simplicity of application these thermometers",
    "have the potential to replace a variety of secondary thermometers currently in use in the low temperature range .",
    "nevertheless , a direct evaluation in terms of the international temperature scales is still lacking .",
    "therefore , the main objective of this work is to investigate the cbt as a primary thermometer in the temperature range below 1 k by comparison with a high accuracy realization of the plts-2000 .",
    "cbts are usually operated in the regime of weak coulomb blockade @xcite where the charging energy @xmath0 is small compared to temperature , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath3 - boltzmann constant )",
    ". then the absolute temperature is obtained from the half width @xmath4 of the dip in the bias voltage dependent conductance curves according to    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the depth of the normalized conductance dip , @xmath7 is the number of tunnel junctions in series , and @xmath8 is the electron charge .",
    "the equation holds also when the condition of small charging energy starts to fail when a linear correction term of @xmath9 is introduced in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ cbtnumcorr ] ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively the conductance curves can be calculated numerically without any approximation @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) .",
    "one advantage of the numerical calculation is that overheating effects due to small electron - phonon coupling can be included in the modeling as described in @xcite .",
    "cbt has the advantage that many ( in our case 100 ) junctions in series produce an enhanced signal , but the distribution in the junction resistances introduces errors in the absolute temperature readout . in the sensors reported in this work , we expect the fabrication inhomogeneity of the junction resistances to be below",
    "10% resulting in an uncertainty in temperature lower than 2% @xcite .",
    "in addition to the conventional cbt thermometer , we present in this work a first comparison of a single junction thermometer ( sjt ) @xcite , that is not affected by fabrication inhomogeneity , with the plts-2000 scale .",
    "sjt demands on the other hand an enhanced experimental effort to precisely measure the smaller signal experimentally at low temperatures .",
    "both thermometers use aluminum oxide for the tunnel barriers because this material results in the highest quality junctions . however , aluminum is a superconducting material below @xmath10 @xmath11 1.2 k and the working principles of both thermometers require normal metal islands .",

    "the latter enables the measurement of the derivative of the @xmath31-@xmath32 curves using lock - in amplifiers .",
    "the ac amplitude is set to be small ( 1% to 3% ) as compared to the expected half width of the conduction curve .",
    "a calibration of the dc voltage measurement is essential as the bias voltage ( @xmath33 ) yields directly the measured temperature according to eq .",
    "( [ cbtnumcorr ] ) .",
    "two methods are principally available for this task in case of cbt : either measuring the voltage including calibration of the voltage amplifier or calibration of the resistive voltage divider and voltage source yielding directly the applied voltage .",
    "the latter was used as the accuracy is higher and the resulting uncertainties are lower , even taking into account the neglected line resistance which was less than 0.1@xmath34 of the sensor resistance . for the sjt measurements ,",
    "only the direct measurement of the voltage with the voltage amplifier gain @xmath35 is suitable for the determination of the bias voltage of the single junction , as the sample divides the applied voltage by a factor of approximately 41 , given by the number of junctions in the array plus the central junction .",
    "the junctions within the array are not similar enough for a precise determination of the division factor .    as @xmath36 is derived from the normalized conductance curves the stability rather than the uncertainty of the conductance values is important . the resulting relative uncertainty for the normalized conductance values from the gain and output stabilities of the preamplifiers and the lock - in amplifiers is estimated to be about @xmath37 .",

    "imperfect glue between the silicon chip and the copper sample holder may begin to influence the result at the low temperature end .    in the model @xcite for the full description of the cbt ,",
    "the temperature reading of the cbt enters the formulas only as a parameter and is derived from the experimental data as a result of a nonlinear approximation . for a correct uncertainty estimation for @xmath36",
    "we have applied monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite . as an example",
    ", we focus on temperatures where the overheating effects are negligible and hence temperature can be derived using a direct fit without correction of the overheating effects .",
    "figure 4 ( left ) demonstrates that overheating effects due to the electron - phonon coupling are negligible at temperatures above 0.4 k. the procedure was as follows . for each conductance curve measured at defined reference temperatures we generated mc - samples by varying stochastically for every single data",
    "point the values for the normalized conductance as well as for the bias voltage within their individual uncertainties limits assuming a normal distribution of them .",

    "the uncertainty estimates for @xmath36 from the mc calculations are more realistic as the uncertainties for the direct fit are obviously too small to account for the observed data point scattering .",

    "is caused by the varying external measurement conditions . ]    in general , the measurement of the sjt requires an increased experimental effort compared to the cbt , as the peak width is quite small ( on the order of 50 @xmath51v at temperatures around 0.1 k ) in relation to the 100 times wider peak of the cbt .",
    "this can be compensated partly with longer time constants for the lock - in amplifiers and an increased measurement frequency for the ac modulation ( from 27.7 hz to 187 hz ) .",

    "the temperature readings from the sjt agree within the achieved measurement accuracy at the reference temperature when overheating effects are included in the analysis .",
    "these results confirm the earlier experimental findings @xcite that an array of tunnel junctions provide a suitable environment for sjt .",
    "however , the resulting uncertainty for both thermometers is in the presented experiments still dominated by the measurement electronics at room temperature .",
    "only a significant improvement in this respect would allow a systematic study of the remaining inherent errors of the devices itself .",
