    "phase diagrams and structural correlations in binary mixtures are much richer than those of their one - component counterparts @xcite since there are additional thermodynamic degrees of freedom . understanding the phase behaviour from first principles @xcite requires the knowledge of the effective interaction forces between the different species which is - in general - a many - body force .",
    "even if this interaction is pairwise additive , the full calculation of structure and phase behaviour has only been done for selected cases . among those are hard spheres @xcite , oppositely charged colloids @xcite , two - dimensional dipolar mixtures @xcite and two - dimensional yukawa mixtures @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a three - dimensional binary colloidal suspension of two species @xmath0 and @xmath1 of charged spheres ( `` macroions '' ) with different charges ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 denoting the electron charge ) and diameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the traditional derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory describes the interaction between the two species as an effective pairwise yukawa potential @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes the dielectric constant of the solvent and @xmath13 is the debye - hckel screening parameter .",
    "the latter is given as @xmath14 where the sum runs over all microions with their charges @xmath15 and partial number densities @xmath16 .",
    "the dlvo theory is a linearized theory and therefore neglects nonlinear screening effects @xcite which give rise to effective many - body forces @xcite .",
    "nonlinear effects can at least partially be accounted for by charge renormalization which is conveniently calculated in a spherical poisson - boltzmann cell model @xcite .",
    "the cell approach was recently generalized towards binary mixtures by torres , tllez and van roij @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "it was shown that charge renormalization is different for the different species such that the ratio of effective charges is different from that of the bare charge .",
    "however , the cross - interaction was not addressed in this study .",
    "the importance of the cross - interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 relative to the direct part @xmath3 and @xmath4 determines the so - called non - additivity parameter @xmath17 of the mixture which is crucial for the topology of phase diagrams .",
    "binary hard sphere systems have been studied as a prototype for any non - additive mixtures @xcite . in general , a positive non - additivity is realized if the cross - interaction is more repulsive than the mean of the two direct interactions . for high positive non",
    "- additivity ( @xmath18 ) , macrophase separation into an @xmath0-rich and @xmath1-rich phase is observed , i.e. the system minimizes the interface where the @xmath2 cross - interactions plays a dominant role .",
    "the other case of negative nonadditivity ( @xmath19 ) implies a weaker cross - interaction in terms of the bare ones such that the system tends to mix and to exhibit micro - phase - separation @xcite .    for pairwise yukawa interactions @xmath20",
    "( @xmath21 , a dimensionless nonadditivity parameter @xmath17 can be quantified by invoking the deviation of an ideal berthelot mixing rule @xcite via the relation @xmath22 for charged suspensions , classical dlvo theory ( see eqn .",
    "( 1 ) ) implies a vanishing @xmath17 since the effective charges are the same in all interactions .",
    "there are other realizations of a binary yukawa system in dusty plasmas @xcite and metallic mixtures @xcite or amorphous silica @xcite .",
    "in fact , the binary yukawa model has been widely used and employed to investigate effective interactions @xcite , fluid - fluid phase separation @xcite , vitrification @xcite and transport properties @xcite . in most of studies of binary yukawa systems ,",
    "the non - additivity parameter is set to zero , except for refs .",
    "@xcite where the effect of positive nonadditivity @xmath17 on fluid - fluid phase separation is considered . in the context of dusty plasmas , there is another recent study showing that the non - additivity parameter @xmath17 is positive in general @xcite .",
    "this leads to macrophase separation in binary dusty plasmas , as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the interaction in dusty plasmas , however , is different from that relevant for charged colloidal suspensions .",
    "while for the former the ion are described by a gurevich distribution , a boltzmann distribution is appropriate for the latter .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the nonadditivity of the cross - interaction for charged colloidal suspensions . using computer simulations with explicit microions",
    "@xcite , we calculate the effective interactions in a charged binary mixture and find that the sign of the non - additivity depends on the parameters , in particular on the charge asymmetry .",
    "the nonadditivity parameter is calculated first by using simulations of three pairs of macroions , namely @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 in a periodically repeated simulation box at fixed screening .",
    "we also consider larger systems with 24 macroions at different compositions in order to check the effect on many - body forces on @xmath17 . in the latter case",
    "we fit the many - body forces by effective pairwise forces @xmath23 and extract @xmath17 from the optimal fit @xcite .",
    "we confirm that @xmath17 is unchanged .",
    "our main findings are i ) that @xmath17 is typically large and can not be neglected and ii ) that the sign of @xmath17 depends on the parameters as e.g. charge asymmetry .",
    "if a binary charged colloidal mixture is described by an effective yukawa model , @xmath17 needs to be incorporated into the description .",
    "for instance when compared to dlvo theory a much better description of the fluid pair structure is achieved within an effective yukawa model and non - vanishing @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model and the simulation method and apply it to the case of two macroions .",
    "many - body simulations with 24 macroions are discussed in sec .",
    ". then we present data for a large system with effective pairwise yukawa forces in order to see the effect of non - vanishing nonadditivity in sec .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "we model all ions as uniformly charged hard spheres such that they are interacting via excluded volume and coulomb forces which are reduced by the dielectric constant @xmath12 of the solvent .",
    "the two species of charged colloids have a mesoscopic hardcore diameter @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) and a total charge @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "@xmath6 ) while all microions are monovalent with a charge @xmath7 ( @xmath7 denoting the electron charge ) and a microscopic hardcore diameter @xmath24 . for finite salt concentrations ,",
    "there are both counter- and coions in the solution and the microscopic core of oppositely charged microions is needed to prevent the system from the coulomb collapse .",
    "the averaged concentration of added salt is denoted with @xmath25 .",
    "the salt is always monovalent .",
    "the system is kept at room temperature @xmath26 such that the bjerrum length for the microions is @xmath27 with @xmath28 the dielectric constant of water at room temperature .",
    "a cubic simulation box of edge length @xmath29 with periodic boundary conditions is used containing two macroions and the following three cases are studied separatedly : i ) two @xmath0 macroions , ii ) two @xmath1 macroions , and iii ) one @xmath0 and one @xmath1 macroion .",
    "the two macroions are placed along the room diagonal of the simulation box and possess a fixed central distance @xmath30 . at fixed macroion positions ,",
    "the microions are moved by constant temperature molecular dynamics and the averaged force @xmath31 acting on the two macroions is calculated .",
    "the latter fulfills newton s third law . for more technical details",
    "we refer to the refs .",
    "then the distance @xmath30 is varied and force - distance curve @xmath32 is gained .    inspired by the dlvo expression ( 1 )",
    ", we anticipate that the screening length will not differ much in the three cases i ) , ii ) , iii ) and that it will be comparable to the debye - hckel expression",
    ". this assumption will be tested and justified later by a many macroion simulation reported in section iii .",
    "therefore we adjust the box length in the three cases in order to reproduce the same debye - hckel screening length ( 2 ) .",
    "results for the distance - resolved forces @xmath32 are shown in figures  [ fig-1][fig-3 ] for the three cases i ) , ii ) , and iii ) for extremely dilute macroion suspension with a packing fraction @xmath33 .",
    "such dilute case is chosen to diminish the boundary effects of the simulation box on the interaction forces .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath8=1220  , @xmath9=680 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the prescribed screening is @xmath36= 0.8 corresponding to box lengths of @xmath37 ( for i ) ) , @xmath38 ( for ii ) ) , and @xmath39 ( for iii ) ) .",
    "the obtained data for the distance - resolved forces @xmath32 were fitted with the yukawa expression @xmath40 with @xmath11 .",
    "the screening parameter @xmath41 and the three effective charge numbers @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are used as fit parameters .",
    "we obtain @xmath45 ( very close to its debye - hckel expression ) and effective charge numbers of @xmath42=470 , @xmath43=260 , and @xmath44=330 such that the nonadditivity parameter is negative : @xmath46    in a similar manner we calculate the interaction forces and yukawa fitting parameters for another packing fraction @xmath47 at which the images of macroions in neighboring cells start to affect the long - range macroion - macroion interactions .",
    "we obtain @xmath48 and effective charge numbers of @xmath42=505 , @xmath43=265 , and @xmath44=342 such that the nonadditivity parameter is @xmath17=-0.13 .    the results for extreme dilute @xmath33 and",
    "dilute @xmath47 cases shown in figures  [ fig-1][fig-3 ] reveal that first of all , the yukawa expression for the forces is an excellent fit over the relevant distance range explored .",
    "moreover , while the screening parameter is very close to its debye - hckel expression , the nonadditivity of 1113 percent is significant .",
    "next we explore the dependence of @xmath17 on the charge asymmetry @xmath49 by changing it in the range from 0 to 1 while keeping the size asymmetry @xmath50=1.8 unchanged . in detail",
    ", we consider the @xmath1-charges @xmath51=0 , 100 , 330 , 580 with fixed @xmath34 and @xmath36=0.8 .",
    "using the same simulation technique and fitting procedure , we extract the nonadditivity parameter @xmath17 according to eq.([nonadd ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig-4 ] .",
    "the nonadditivity parameter @xmath17 shows a clear non - monotonicity as a function of @xmath51 starting from positive values and turning to negative ones and back to positive ones as @xmath51 is increasing . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the @xmath4 interaction is small , but the @xmath2 interaction has still a repulsive contribution from entropic contact force @xcite which drives @xmath17 altogether towards a positive value .",
    "the other cases are less intuitive and we do not have a simple argument for the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "we have finally considered also the case of size - symmetric ( @xmath53 ) but charge - asymmetric @xmath54=1.76 macroions at a fixed screening length of @xmath55 . here , the nonadditivity parameter @xmath17 was found to be -0.01 , much smaller than for the corresponding size - asymmetric case with @xmath56 .",
    "hence size - asymmetry appears to be the more crucial input for the nonadditivity .",
    "let us now turn to a many body simulation of the primitive model in a cubic cell containing altogether @xmath57 macroions with different compositions @xmath58 .",
    "the simulation box contains also @xmath59 oppositely charged counterions , and @xmath60 salt ion pairs .",
    "the other parameters are as before if not otherwise stated .",
    "six different macroion packing fractions were considered : @xmath61= 0.017 , 0.034 , 0.12 , 0.16 , 0.23 , 0.3 .",
    "for all simulations the salt concentration was kept constant at @xmath62=4@xmath63 mol / l .",
    "now both the microions and the macroions are moved by constant temperature molecular dynamics .",
    "a simulation snapshot is shown in figure  [ fig-7 ] .",
    "after equilibration , we stored 200 statistically independent macroion configurations for each run .",
    "for each stored configuration , we averaged the total forces @xmath64 ( @xmath65=1 , @xmath66 ) acting on the @xmath65th macroion over the microionic degrees of freedom .",
    "these forces are clearly many - body forces , in general .",
    "following the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , we assign an optimal effective pair interaction by fitting all forces @xmath64 in all stored configurations by the same pairwise yukawa interaction . as in section",
    "ii , the four fitting parameters are @xmath13 and the three effective charge numbers @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 which determine the nonadditivity @xmath17 directly",
    ".    the results of the optimal fit for @xmath17 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath36 are shown in figures  [ fig - nonadd][fig - kd ] as a function of the varied macroion volume fraction @xmath61 for three different compositions @xmath67 .",
    "the nonadditivity shown in figure  [ fig - nonadd ] is clearly negative and decreases with increasing packing fraction .",
    "this trend can be intuitively understood since asymmetries are amplified if one approaches smaller interparticle distances .",
    "a second important conclusion from figure  [ fig - nonadd ] is that the many - body simulations yield the _ same _ value for @xmath17 as those obtained from the simulations of pairs in sect .",
    "ii . in fact",
    ", the value @xmath68 is reproduced at low volume fractions @xmath47 .",
    "the effective charges and screening length deduced from pair macroion simulations for @xmath47 perfectly fit the simulation data for many macroions at the same packing fraction @xmath61 for the macroions .",
    "the effective charge numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 shown in figures  [ fig - z1 ] and [ fig - z2 ] increase slightly with volume fraction which is the standard trend also for one - component charged suspensions @xcite .",
    "the screening constant shown in figure  [ fig - kd ] increases with @xmath61 following the same trend as its debye - hckel expression which is also indicated in figure  [ fig - kd ] .",
    "we finally explore the impact of a non - vanishing @xmath17 on the fluid structure of binary charged suspensions . in doing so we make use of the optimal effective yukawa fit gained in sect .",
    "iii and use it as an input in classical coarse - grained binary yukawa simulations ( without any microions ) .",
    "these simulations can be done for much larger systems and we included 1000 @xmath0 and 1000 @xmath1 particles at equimolar composition .",
    "two volume fraction are considered , a dilute system with @xmath61=0.034 and a dense system where @xmath61=0.3 .    the effective macroion charge numbers , the screening constant and the nonadditivity parameter were chosen from results described in the previous section . in detail , for the dilute system : @xmath69= 530 , @xmath70= 269 , @xmath71=1.3 , @xmath17=-0.14 , while for the dense system , @xmath69=580 , @xmath70=330 , @xmath71=3.4 , @xmath17=-0.2 .",
    "at these parameters the system is in the fluid phase .",
    "we have calculated the partial pair correlations @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the large yukawa substitute system and the smaller system with explicit microions .",
    "the results are presented in figures  [ fig - dilute ] and [ fig - dense ] .",
    "there is good agreement for the dilute case demonstrating that the yukawa fit is reproducing the pair correlations . for the dense system",
    ", there is again agreement except for the location of the first peak in @xmath75 .",
    "this could have to do with finite - size effects of the @xmath76 primitive model systems which are expected to get more prominent at high packing fractions .    as a reference",
    "we have also performed yukawa simulations with effective interactions based on two effective charges @xmath69 and @xmath70 but where @xmath17 is set to zero , i.e. where @xmath77 .",
    "the differences in the pair structure are pointing to the importance of nonzero nonadditivity .",
    "there are even more deviation of the fluid pair structure when the simple dlvo expression is taken , which significantly overestimates the structure , see the dotted lines in figures  [ fig - dilute ] and [ fig - dense ] .",
    "one of the main conclusions therefore is that one has to be careful if @xmath17 for binary charged suspensions is neglected .",
    "in conclusion we have determined the non - additivity parameter in binary charged suspensions by primitive model computer simulations with explicit microions and found significant deviations from zero .",
    "the sign depends on the actual parameter combination , in particular on the charge asymmetry .",
    "this implies that a realistic modelling of charged suspensions on the effective pairwise yukawa level should incorporate a non - vanishing @xmath17 .",
    "a priori an intuition for the sign of @xmath17 is difficult .",
    "intuition only works in limiting cases .",
    "for example , in the depletion limit of many small macroions and few big ones , there is attraction between the big ones which would result in a positive @xmath17 .    in the future ,",
    "more detailed investigation are planned to explore the full parameter space better .",
    "it would be interesting to calculate the effective interaction in the solid phase relative to the fluid crystalline phase .",
    "in inhomogeneous situations like sedimentation in a gravitational field , binary suspensions have been examined by primitive model computer simulations @xcite and a simple binary yukawa pairwise interaction model was found to be inappropriate @xcite . since in our bulk simulation the pairwise yukawa model was a good fit , we expect that this is due to the density gradient in the system but this will require more detailed studies",
    ".    binary suspension can be prepared in a controlled way @xcite and their structural correlation , dynamics and phase diagrams can be explored .",
    "depending on the size and charge ratio different freezing diagrams ( azeotropic , spindle , eutectic ) @xcite have been obtained in the experiments .",
    "since the nonadditivity @xmath17 depends on the composition , this might point to the fact that details of the variation of @xmath17 with composition and also with the phases itself ( fluid or crystal ) determines the shape of the freezing diagrams .",
    "finally it would be interesting to study nonadditivity effects in charged mixtures of rods @xcite or rod and sphere mixtures .",
    "it would also be interesting to explore the effect of multivalent counterions which could lead to mutual attraction @xcite .",

    "<S> this interaction is close to a yukawa ( or derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek(dlvo ) ) pair potential but the @xmath2 cross - interaction is different from the geometric mean of the two direct @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions . as a function of charge asymmetry , the corresponding nonadditivity parameter is first positive , then getting significantly negative and is getting then positive again . we finally show that an inclusion of nonadditivity within an optimal effective yukawa model gives better predictions for the fluid pair structure than dlvo - theory . </S>"
