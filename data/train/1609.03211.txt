    "a network of @xmath1 objects can be denoted by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the set of nodes , and @xmath4 is the set of edges between nodes . in this article , we focus on symmetric weighted networks represented by an @xmath5 adjacency matrix , @xmath6 , where the element @xmath7 measures the strength of the relationship between nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "traditionally , statistical network analysis focuses on modeling _ observed _ network structure ( e.g. , highway systems or electrical transmission grids ) .",
    "in this situation , nodes are well defined and the physical links between these nodes can be directly observed @xcite . however , in some fields of research the explicit network structure may not be observable .",
    "this is particularly true of the social sciences . in these fields ,",
    "the observable data are groups of individuals and it is presumed that the groups are the result of some latent network . the fundamental task is to construct a network from such data .    a familiar example is provided by wasserman and faust @xcite who introduce the problem of inferring the relationships among a collection of children based on their attendance at birthday parties . in this introductory dataset ,",
    "the children represent nodes in the network and the birthday parties represent subsets of children .    in our paper , a collection of nodes observed in the same sample",
    "is called a _ group _ and a dataset of these observations is referred to as _ grouped data_. in wasserman and faust s example , each party defines a group and the set of all parties is the grouped data .",
    "two individuals are said to _ co - occur _ if they appear in the same group .",
    "one common technique used to estimate @xmath6 from grouped data is to count the number of times that a pair of nodes appears in the same group @xcite .",
    "frequently , a threshold is applied to this count to create a symmetric unweighted undirected adjacency matrix ; however , it has been shown that the characteristics of networks inferred by this technique are sensitive to the choice of threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt a generalized version of the inter - citation frequency @xcite which measures the number of times a pair of nodes is observed to co - occur in the dataset .",
    "we refer to this measure as the _ co - occurrence matrix_.    an alternative technique , called the _ half weight index _",
    "@xcite , estimates @xmath6 by the frequency that two nodes co - occur given that one of them is observed .",
    "this addresses a shortcoming of the co - occurrence matrix in which nodes that appear rarely can be estimated to have a weak relationship even though the relationship is quite strong @xcite .",
    "the co - occurrence matrix and half weight index both have probabilistic interpretations .",
    "the co - occurrence matrix estimates the probability that two nodes will be observed together .",
    "the half weight index estimates the probability that two nodes will be observed together given that one of them is observed .",
    "however , the probability or conditional probability of co - occurrences is not equivalent to the probability of connection of nodes .",
    "in fact , neither of these techniques describe the process which leads to the generation of the observed groups .",
    "it is unclear how the descriptive statistics relate to the grouped data in these methods .",
    "we propose a model - based approach to infer the latent network from grouped data .",
    "we refer to this model of group formation as the _ hub model _ because each observed group is assumed to be brought together by a hub node . a group generated by the hub model",
    "is illustrated in figure [ f : sample hub ] .",
    "the hub model belongs to the family of finite mixture models .",
    "such mixture models and their variants have been applied in many different situations including text classification @xcite , topic models @xcite , fingerprint identification @xcite , and product recommendation @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of hub models is that we are able to give the strength of the relationship @xmath7 a definition which is both mathematically clear and at the same time practical to researchers . in the hub model , @xmath7 is defined as the probability that node @xmath8 will include node @xmath9 when @xmath8 is the hub node of a group . the formal definition of the hub model will be given in section [ s : model ] .",
    "as a graphical introduction to the performance of hub models , consider figure [ f : shining_true ] where relationship strength is represented by the width of the links between nodes .",
    "in this example there is a pair of nodes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which never directly bond to each other . despite the aversion between these two nodes , they share a number of strong relationships with common nodes and therefore often co - occur . in figure",
    "[ f : shining_o ] , we can see that the co - occurrence matrix mistakenly assigns a relatively strong relationship to nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in figure [ f : shining_h ] , the half weight index arrives at a very similar conclusion as the co - occurrence matrix . in both figures",
    "[ f : shining_o ] and [ f : shining_h ] , the non - existent relationship between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 is actually estimated to be stronger than all other relationships . by contrast , results of the hub model in figure [ f : shining_a ] clearly capture the latent network of the population .    0.2        0.2        0.2        0.2     to the best of our knowledge , there have been very limited attempts to infer latent networks by model - based approaches .",
    "rabbat et al.@xcite provides an application for telecommunication networks .",
    "rabbat et al .",
    "modeled the process of group formation as a random walk from a source node to a terminal node .",
    "the nodes along the path were subjected to an unknown permutation to account for the lack of order information . treating permutations as missing data , rabbat et al .",
    "employed a _",
    "monte carlo em _",
    "algorithm based on importance sampling to estimate the parameters of the model .",
    "this model assumed a distinctly different process of group formation .",
    "in the following sections we present a formal description of the grouped data structure , review existing techniques , and define hub models",
    ". then we study hub model identifiability and prove that a symmetry constraint on the adjacency matrix is a sufficient condition for identifiability .",
    "we propose an em algorithm to solve the maximum likelihood estimator of hub model .",
    "we then evaluate the performance of the proposed method by simulation studies .",
    "we apply the hub model to infer the relationships between united states senators in the 110@xmath0 congress based on their co - sponsorship of legislation , the relationships among the characters of the 18@xmath0 century chinese novel , _ dream of the red chamber _ , and apply the hub model to floral dispersion over north america .",
    "we close with a discussion that returns to the subject of identifiability along with a phenomenon of `` self - sparsity '' of the hub model estimators .",
    "for a population of @xmath1 individuals , @xmath12 , we observe @xmath13 subsets of the global population , @xmath14 .",
    "each observed subset @xmath15 can be coded as an @xmath1 length row vector @xmath16 where :    @xmath17    the full set of observations is denoted by a @xmath18 matrix , @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 row of @xmath19 is @xmath16 .      inferring latent networks from grouped data relies on descriptive statistics which count the number of times that two nodes are observed together .",
    "we focus on two popular techniques which estimate probabilities of individual behavior .",
    "an intuitive and computationally simple measure of grouped data is the _ co - occurrence matrix_. versions of this technique appear throughout the literature under many names and notations including : _ capacity matrix _",
    "@xcite , _ sociomatrix _",
    "@xcite , _ inter - citation frequency _ @xcite , _ cocitation matrix _",
    "@xcite , and _ strength _ @xcite .",
    "a co - occurrence matrix , @xmath21 , is an @xmath22 symmetric matrix , defined by : @xmath23    which estimates the frequency that the nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are observed in the same group .",
    "one shortcoming of the co - occurrence matrix is that it estimates the probability that two nodes _ will be observed _ to co - occur in a given observation .",
    "that is , if two nodes have a strong relationship , but appear in the dataset infrequently , the co - occurrence matrix will estimate a low probability that the two nodes _ will be observed _ to co - occur .",
    "as an example , consider four nodes @xmath24 and the grouped data represented in table [ t : o_vs_h_example ] .",
    ".notional grouped data [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we now derive the theoretical relationship between symmetric elements of the adjacency matrix . as in section",
    "[ s : ident ] , let @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the observed groups which contain only node @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "further , let @xmath29 represent the group that is observed to contain only the pair @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ".    under the hub models @xmath30 and @xmath30 are given by and .",
    "in the asymmetric case , the probability of the pair is : @xmath31    by simply reordering the terms of equations [ e : prob_gx ] and [ e : prob_gy ] , they can be plugged back into equation [ e : gxy ] to give : @xmath32    by some simple algebra , we find the following relationship between the elements of the adjacency matrix : @xmath33}{\\big[\\mathbb{p}(g = g^{x})+\\mathbb{p}(g = g^{xy})\\big]-a_{yx}\\big[\\mathbb{p}(g = g^{x})+\\mathbb{p}(g = g^{y})+\\mathbb{p}(g = g^{xy})\\big]}.\\ ] ]    using , we can calculate the relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the example above .",
    "this is represented in figure [ f : a12 ] by the solid line .",
    "clearly the observed solutions are falling along this theoretical curve .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , hub models introduce an innovative approach to the task of implicit network inference . by defining a model - based generating mechanism to link the latent network to observed grouped data and applying an em algorithm , we are able to estimate the network using this model .    not only are the estimators easy to calculate in a reasonable amount of time , but the estimators have a practical interpretation .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 measures the probability that a member of a population will form a group .",
    "@xmath7 measures the probability that a member of the population will be included in a group formed by node @xmath8 .",
    "the hub models compare favorably against existing techniques .",
    "since the co - occurrence matrix and half weight index lack a generating mechanism to connect them to the observed grouped data , these measures often can not detect important features of a network .    by applying the hub model to the 110@xmath0 united states congress dataset , the 18@xmath0 century chinese novel _ dream of the red chamber _ , and a dataset of flora in north america , we demonstrate that the hm is able to detect important features in the relationships between nodes in complex situations .",
    "we conclude by providing some initial insights into self - sparsity and the identifiability of hm . to fully understand these properties",
    "is an intriguing research topic and will be explored in our future works ."
