    "no longer an epistemological curiosity , entanglement is becoming an experimentally accessible resource ; in particular , entangled @xmath0-qubit states have been proposed as means to beat the so - called shot - noise limit accuracy in parameter estimation   and references therein . ] ; actually , a first step in this direction using many - body systems has been recently realized : entangled states in systems of ultra - cold atoms have been generated through spin - squeezing techniques  @xcite .",
    "the aim is to use them as input states in interferometric apparatuses , specifically constructed for quantum enhanced metrological applications . in such devices ,",
    "the initial @xmath0-qubit states are rotated by means of collective pseudo - spin operators ; for distinguishable qubits , the relevance of entangled states is readily exposed by addressing single particle contributions to the collective operators  @xcite ; however , in the case of trapped ultra - cold atoms , the qubits involved are identical and thus not addressable , a fact that has often not been fully appreciated in the recent literature on quantum metrology and that has recently been tackled in refs .  [ 25,26 ] .    for @xmath0 distinguishable qubits ,",
    "the notion of quantum entanglement is well - established ( see the review  [ 27 ] and references therein ) and strictly associated with the tensor product structure of the hilbert space , @xmath1 .",
    "such a structure is no longer available any longer for identical qubits and this asks for a different approach to the notions of non - locality and entanglement : it should not anymore refer to the particle aspect of first quantization , rather be based on the behavior of correlation functions of commuting observables , closely related to the mode description typical of second quantization .",
    "in the following , we characterize the entangled states of @xmath0 boson systems according to the generalized notion of separability given in ref .  [",
    "25 ] ; in particular , we show that the negativity , which measures the lack of positivity of partially transposed states , is an exhaustive bipartite entanglement witness .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of distinguishable qubits where , apart for two qubits or one qubit and one qutrit , there exist entangled states with zero negativity  @xcite .",
    "then , we show that a purely dephasing noise which , for distinguishable qubits , is responsible for mere decoherence , in the framework of identical bosons can instead generate entanglement ; however , we also show that this noise - induced entanglement can not be used to improve on the sensitivities of matter interferometric devices based on such systems .",
    "since @xmath0-boson density matrices must be convex combinations of symmetric @xmath0-particle states , the tensor product structure which is natural for distinguishable particles is not appropriate for discussing the entanglement properties of systems of identical particles .",
    "indeed , the hilbert space for two identical bosonic qubits is the sub - space of @xmath2 spanned by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is any orthonormal basis in @xmath6 .",
    "entanglement should rather be investigated by means of creation @xmath7 and annihilation operators @xmath8 of single - particle orthonormal basis states @xmath4 , obeying the canonical commutation relations @xmath9=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "although the notion of entanglement in many - body systems has already been addressed and discussed in the literature ( for instance , see refs .",
    "[ 28 - 44 ] ) , only limited results actually apply to the case of identical particles . in ref .",
    "[ 25 ] it has been proposed that , when dealing with identical particles , entanglement should correspond to whether , given a state @xmath10 of the system , there are non - classical correlations among commuting observables belonging to two generic commuting sub - algebras @xmath11 of the entire algebra generated by the set of all creation and annihilation operators , which we shall refer to as an _",
    "algebraic bipartition_. an observable @xmath12 is called `` @xmath11-local '' if it is of the form @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and a state @xmath10 `` @xmath11-separable '' if the expectation values @xmath16 of local operators @xmath17 can be decomposed into a convex linear combination of product of expectations : @xmath18 in terms of other states @xmath19 , @xmath20 ;",
    "otherwise , @xmath10 is said @xmath11-entangled .",
    "the previous definition reduces to the standard notion of entanglement for distinguishable particles .",
    "for instance , in the case of a two qubit system , by choosing the algebraic bipartition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the algebra of @xmath23 matrices over @xmath24 , and the expectation value @xmath25 defined in the usual way through the trace with the two - qubit density matrix @xmath26 , condition  ( [ def - sep ] ) readily gives that @xmath26 must be a convex combination of product states .    it should be stressed that , in the case of identical particles , there is no _ a priori _ given bipartition so that questions about entanglement and separability , non - locality and locality are meaningful only with reference to a specific class of ( commuting ) observables ; the general definition given above precisely stems from this fundamental observation .",
    "consider a system of @xmath0 bosons that can be found in only two different modes , like for instance a system consisting of ultracold atoms confined by a double - well potential .",
    "then , the states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , describe one atom located within the left , respectively the right well .",
    "these states correspond to two spatial modes and are created by the action on the vacuum state @xmath27 of creation operators @xmath28 , @xmath29 : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "when the total number @xmath0 is conserved , the symmetric fock space of this two - mode system is generated by the @xmath32 orthonormal vectors : @xmath33 in @xmath34 , respectively @xmath35 in @xmath36 , one obtains two commuting subalgebras @xmath37 and @xmath38 that in turn generate the whole algebra of bounded operators for this two mode bosonic system .",
    "in general , one can show that ( @xmath39)-separable density matrices must be convex combinations of projections @xmath40 ( see ref .",
    "[ 25 ] ) : @xmath41 this is so because @xmath37 and @xmath38 generate the whole two - mode @xmath0 boson algebra so that the only pure @xmath42)-separable states are projections onto the eigenstates  ( [ nfock ] ) of the number operator @xmath43 which thus span the convex subset of @xmath42)-separable mixed states .",
    "notice that , in first quantization , an ( @xmath39)-separable state for a @xmath44 bosonic qubits like @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "such state is surely entangled for distinguishable qubits , while , according to our definition , it is no longer so for identical bosonic qubits ; the reason is that its entanglement is only formal as it comes from the necessary symmetrization of the separable state @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "for bipartite systems of distinguishable particles one knows that states @xmath26 that do not remain positive under partial transposition are entangled  @xcite and are witnessed by the so - called _ negativity _ : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the transposition with respect to the first party .    since @xmath50 , if @xmath49 does not remain positive under partial transposition , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , there can be entangled states that remain positive under partial transposition whence @xmath53 ; therefore , the negativity is not an exhaustive entanglement witness for generic bipartite states of distinguishable particles .",
    "remarkably , negativity is instead an exhaustive entanglement witness for the case at hands : indeed , by performing the partial transposition with respect to the first mode of a generic two mode @xmath0-boson state @xmath54 one obtains an operator on a larger hilbert space than the sector of the fock space with fixed @xmath0 , namely @xmath55 which is such that @xmath56 whence the negativity @xmath57 vanishes if and only if @xmath26 has null off - diagonal element with respect to the fock states relative to the chosen bipartition , _",
    "i.e. _ it is separable because of the form  ( [ sep ] ) .      while the fock number states  ( [ nfock ] ) are @xmath11-separable",
    ", important examples of @xmath11-entangled states are the so - called discrete coherent states @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "these states describe the situation when all @xmath0 boson are in the same single particle state @xmath60 : their off - diagonal elements do not vanish .",
    "therefore , the corresponding negativity is also non - vanishing ; indeed , it reads @xmath61    the bogolubov transformation @xmath62 changes the spatial modes @xmath63 into energy modes ; indeed , it corresponds to a change of basis from that of spatially localized states , to the one of the eigenstates @xmath64 , @xmath65 of a single particle hamiltonian with a highly penetrable barrier .",
    "the algebras @xmath66 , respectively @xmath67 constructed by means of polynomials in @xmath68 , respectively @xmath69 commute , generate the two - mode @xmath0 boson algebra and thus provide another possible algebraic bipartition .",
    "it thus turn out that the @xmath11-entangled coherent state @xmath70 results the fock number state @xmath71 for the number operator @xmath72 , and therefore it results @xmath73-separable .",
    "thus , when we refer to the negativity of a state @xmath26 , one must specify with respect to which algebraic bipartition the partial transposition is performed ; indeed , @xmath74    as another instance of the dependence of the notions of entanglement and non - locality on the chosen bipartition , consider the operators @xmath75 that satisfy the @xmath76 algebraic relations @xmath77=i\\,j_z$ ] and their cyclic permutations .",
    "they are all non - local with respect to the algebraic bipartition @xmath11 and such are the rotations @xmath78 and @xmath79 they generate , while @xmath80 is @xmath11-local .    by means of the bogolubov transformation  ( [ bogol ] )",
    "one rewrites @xmath81 relatively to @xmath73 , it is now @xmath82 which acts locally .",
    "an important feature of matter interferometry based upon ultracold atoms trapped in double well potential is the coherence between the spatial modes ; this is endangered by the presence of a dephasing noise that tends to suppress the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath83 , @xmath84 , with respect to the orthonormal basis of fock states  ( [ nfock ] ) .",
    "the effects of this kind of noise can be described by the following master equation  . ]",
    "@xmath85 where @xmath26 is the @xmath0 boson density matrix , @xmath86 measures the strength of the noise and @xmath87 is the collective spin operator in  ( [ jsab ] ) that commutes with the number operator @xmath88 .",
    "one easily checks that the matrix elements with respect to the eigenstates  ( [ nfock ] ) satisfy @xmath89 whence this kind of noisy irreversible time - evolution tends to diagonalize the system states with respect to their basis : @xmath90 it thus follows that the @xmath11-negativity either decreases exponentially in time , @xmath91 if the initial state is @xmath11-entangled or remains zero as the dephasing noise has no possibility of creating non - local effects with respect to the bipartition @xmath11 .",
    "this is best seen by rewriting the solution  ( [ sol1 ] ) in the more suggestive form @xmath92 which , on one hand , explicitly exhibits the kraus from of the completely positive maps solutions to  ( [ mastereq ] ) and , on the other hand , shows the impossibility of generating @xmath11-entanglement as the rotations generated by @xmath87 are all @xmath11-local .    however , they are not local with respect to the bipartition @xmath73 obtained by the bogolubov transformation  ( [ bogol ] ) and are thus able to raise from zero the @xmath73-negativity of an initial @xmath73-separable state . for instance , consider the pure state  ( [ coherent0b ] ) as initial state . using  ( [ bogol ] ) one finds @xmath93 so that the time - evolving state reads @xmath94 the time - evolution thus results in a mixed state which surely has non - vanishing off - diagonal elements @xmath95 with respect to the orthonormal basis of eigenstates of @xmath96 and thus @xmath97 .",
    "the use of @xmath0 bosons states for measuring an angle @xmath98 by interferometric techniques is based on the following scheme : an input state @xmath26 is rotated into a final state @xmath99 where @xmath98 by means of the collective spin operator in the direction of a unit vector @xmath100 : @xmath101 ; then , on the rotated state one performs the measurement of a collective spin operator @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and , for sake of convenience , we choose @xmath26 such that @xmath104 along the third orthogonal unit vector @xmath105 . by error propagation , the mean square error @xmath106 is related to the error @xmath107 in the measurement of the small rotation angle @xmath98 by  @xcite : @xmath108 where the parameter @xmath109 measure the amount of squeezing in the state @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , for any orthogonal triplet of space - directions @xmath100 , @xmath110 , @xmath105 , the heisenberg uncertainty relations read @xmath111 and @xmath26 is a squeezed state if one of the variances can be made smaller than @xmath112 .",
    "the value @xmath113 is called shot - noise limit ; in the case of distinguishable qubits , it gives the lower bound to the attainable accuracies when the input state @xmath26 is separable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for systems consisting of distinguishable qubit , entanglement in the initial state @xmath26 is necessary to achieve sub - shot - noise accuracies . an entangled initial state is usually prepared by preliminary squeezing operations  @xcite ; indeed , from  ( [ squeezparam0 ] ) , preparing the initial state @xmath26 such that @xmath114 guarantees an achievable sub - shot - noise accuracy in the determination of @xmath98",
    "however , in ref .",
    "[ 26 ] it is shown that this is not strictly necessary in ultracold atom interferometry ; indeed , in such experimental contexts , one is dealing with identical bosons and then the necessary non - local effects necessary for beating the shot - noise limit can be provided by the interferometric apparatus itself .    in the previous section",
    "we have seen that the presence of dephasing noise destroys @xmath115-entanglement , but creates @xmath116-entanglement .",
    "it is thus of interest to see whether this latter fact allows one to achieve sub - shot - noise accuracies by simply letting the @xmath116-non - local noisy mechanism act .",
    "in order to do so we need compute the mean values @xmath117 and @xmath118 of collective spin operator aligned along the unit vector @xmath119 with respect to the time - evolving state  ( [ sol1 ] ) ; use of  ( [ sol2 ] ) yields @xmath120 in terms of the rotated unit vector @xmath121 furthermore , given the mean value @xmath122 + one finds @xmath123 because of the convexity of the function @xmath124 , the second line above is positive and one estimates @xmath125 if the initial state @xmath26 is such that for no orthogonal directions @xmath126 the squeezing parameter  ( [ squeezparam ] ) is less than one , then , as @xmath127 , one gets @xmath128 and , again by convexity , @xmath129 thus , although under the dephasing noise some @xmath0-bosons states can get entangled , no squeezing can be achieved by such means ; indeed , @xmath130 though not metrologically relevant , such an environment generated entanglement might however be useful for other quantum informational tasks like those involving quantum gates constructed by using systems of ultracold bosons trapped in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "in the case of systems of identical bosons , it is necessary to introduce a new , algebraic definition of separability ; indeed , the standard one based on an a priori factorized form of the involved hilbert space is no longer available . based on a natural notion of entanglement given in terms of correlations among commuting sub - algebras of observables , we have first proved that , unlike for distinguishable qubits , entangled states of @xmath0 bosonic qubits are completely identified by their non zero negativity which is therefore an exhaustive bipartite entanglement witness for such systems .",
    "furthermore , we have showed that even a simple dephasing noise which , for distinguishable particles exhibits merely decoherence effects , can instead generate entanglement among identical bosons .",
    "these results may be relevant in concrete applications to systems of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices ; however , while the entanglement generated by purely dephasing noise can be used for the practical implementation of quantum informational protocols , it can not augment the sensitivity of ultracold atom based interferometric devices ."
