    "solar coronal loops are likely to be heated by ohmic dissipation of field - aligned electric currents .",
    "these currents are driven by photospheric motions which twist and shear the magnetic fieldlines at the loop footpoints .",
    "the generation of small scales in the spatial distribution of these currents has been observed and studied in recent simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "small scale currents are required by most coronal heating theories , since they produce a major enhancement of the energy dissipation rate .",
    "the development of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in coronal loops has recently been proposed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) as a likely mechanism to provide such enhancement , since the energy being pumped by footpoint motions is naturally transferred to small scale structures by the associated energy cascade .",
    "in the present paper we numerically test this scenario , describing the dynamics of a coronal loop through the reduced mhd ( rmhd ) approximation . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the rmhd approximation and perform a dimensional analysis of the equations , which leads to an interesting prediction for the functional dependence of the heating rate with the physical parameters of the problem .",
    "the details of the numerical simulations are summarized in  3 and an overview of the results is given in  4 .",
    "a quantitative scaling law for the heating rate is derived in  5 , and the relevant results of this paper are listed in  6 .",
    "when a coronal loop with an initially uniform magnetic field @xmath1 is driven by photospheric motions at its footpoints , a rather complex dynamical evolution sets in , which is described by velocity and magnetic fields . for incompressible and elongated loops , i.e. loops of length @xmath2 and transverse section @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , the velocity ( @xmath5 ) and magnetic @xmath6 ) fields can be written in terms of a stream function @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and a vector potential @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 is determined by the rmhd equations ( @xcite ) : @xmath13 + \\eta \\lapl a \\label{eq : dta}\\ ] ] @xmath14 - [ a , j ] + \\nu \\lapl w \\label{eq : dtw}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the alfvn speed , @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath17 is the plasma resistivity .",
    "the quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20-components of vorticity and electric current density , respectively .",
    "the non - linear terms are standard poisson brackets , i.e. @xmath21=\\dx u\\dy v - \\dy u\\dx v$ ] .",
    "we assume periodicity for the lateral boundary conditions , and specify the velocity fields at the photospheric boundaries , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the stream function which describes stationary and incompressible footpoint motions .",
    "the strength of this external velocity field is therefore proportional to a typical photospheric velocity @xmath24 .    to transform into their dimensionless form , we choose @xmath25 and @xmath2 as the units for transverse and longitudinal distances .",
    "since the dimensions of all physical quantities involved in these equations can be expressed as combinations of _ length _ and _ time _ , let us choose @xmath26 as the time unit .",
    "the dimensionless rmhd equations are : @xmath27 + { 1 \\over s } \\lapl a \\label{eq : dta2}\\ ] ] @xmath28 - [ a , j ] + { 1 \\over r } \\lapl w \\label{eq : dtw2}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the magnetic and kinetic reynolds numbers .",
    "hereafter , we will consider the case @xmath31 , and thus the ( common ) reynolds number will be the only dimensionless parameter explicitly present in .",
    "however , the boundary condition ( ) brings an extra dimensionless parameter into play , which is the photospheric velocity @xmath24 divided by our velocity units , i.e. @xmath32 . since @xmath33 ( @xmath34 : photospheric turnover time ) , this velocity ratio is equivalent to the ratio between the alfven time @xmath35 and the photospheric turnover time @xmath34",
    ". therefore , from purely dimensional considerations , we can derive the following important result : _ for any physical quantity , its dimensionless version _",
    "@xmath36 _ should be an arbitrary function of the only two dimensionless parameters of the problem , i.e. _",
    "@xmath37    for instance , let us consider the important case of the heating rate per unit mass , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "its dimensionless version is , @xmath39    one of kolmogorov s hypothesis in his theory for stationary turbulent regimes at very large reynolds numbers ( @xcite ) , states that the dissipation rate is independent of the reynolds number ( see also @xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we show that externally driven coronal loops eventually reach a stationary turbulent regime .",
    "therefore , hereafter we assume that the dependence of the dissipation rate @xmath40 with the reynolds number @xmath41 in can be neglected .",
    "for moderated values of the reynolds numbers as the ones considered here , we observed only a mild dependence of the dissipation rate with s ( see also @xcite ) , in accordance with kolmogorov s assumption .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath42    we performed a sequence of numerical simulations for different values of the ratio @xmath43 to determine the function @xmath44 .",
    "for the numerical simulations of , @xmath12 and @xmath11 are expanded in fourier modes in each @xmath45 plane ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the equations for the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are time - evolved using a semi - implicit scheme .",
    "linear terms are treated in a fully implicit fashion , while nonlinear terms are evolved using a predictor - corrector scheme .",
    "also , nonlinear terms are evaluated following a @xmath50 fully dealiased ( see @xcite ) pseudo - spectral technique ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to compute @xmath20-derivatives we use a standard method of finite differences in a staggered regular grid ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we model the photospheric boundary motion in as @xmath51 constant inside the ring @xmath52 , and @xmath53 elsewhere .",
    "this choice is intended to simulate a stationary and isotropic pattern of photospheric granular motions of diameters between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we chose a narrowband and non - random forcing to make sure that the broadband energy spectra and the signatures of intermittency that we obtained ( see below ) are exclusively determined by the nonlinear nature of the mhd equations .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 , as mentioned above .",
    "we performed a sequence of numerical simulations of with @xmath58 gridpoints , @xmath59 and different values of the ratio @xmath60 in the range @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the typical behavior of the heating rate as a function of time , is shown in figure 1 for the particular case of @xmath62 .",
    "after an initial transient , the heating rate is seen to approach a stationary level .",
    "this level is fully consistent with the heating requirements for coronal active regions of @xmath63 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the intermittent behavior of this time series , which is typical of turbulent systems , is also ubiquitous in all our simulations .",
    "once the stationary regime is reached in each of the simulations , we determine the mean value and rms of the departure of the series from the mean . a stronger indication of the presence of a turbulent regime , is the development of a broadband energy power spectrum , which behaves like @xmath0 for both two and three dimensional mhd turbulence ( kraichnan spectrum ) . to compute the energy power spectrum",
    ", we performed a single simulation with better spatial resolution ( @xmath64 ) , to allow for a more extended inertial range .",
    "the parameter for this simulation is @xmath62 and @xmath65 .",
    "the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 was taken at @xmath66 , i.e. well in the stationary regime .",
    "this higher spatial resolution is still insufficient for the formation of a broad inertial range to determine the slope of these spectra with confidence .",
    "however , the observed slope is consistent with a kraichnan spectrum , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "also , note that the kinetic and magnetic power spectra reach equipartition at large wavenumbers , even though the total kinetic energy is much smaller than the total magnetic energy .",
    "another important consequence of the energy power spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "2 , is the fact that smaller scales dissipate more energy than the larger scales , since @xmath67",
    ". three dimensional simulations of loops driven by random footpoint motions have shown that energy dissipation preferentially occurs in current sheets which form exponentially fast ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "within the framework of mhd turbulence , two dimensional simulations also show the ubiquitous presence of current sheets evolving in a rather dynamic fashion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of elongated current sheets as the most common dissipative structures is also apparent in these simulations ( also @xcite ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of the electric current density @xmath68 for our @xmath64 simulation ( @xmath62 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "intense currents going upward ( downward ) are shown in white ( black ) at various planes @xmath69 , and for @xmath66 .",
    "although the reconnection in these turbulent regimes is expected to be fast ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the reynolds numbers attained by current simulations can not provide a definite answer to this question .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to derive the functional dependence of the heating rate with the ratio between the two relevant timescales ( see ) . to this end",
    ", we performed various simulations for different values of the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "figure 4 shows that this functional dependence can be adequately fit by a power law , i.e.    @xmath70    each diamond corresponds to the mean value of the heating rate for a particular simulation in its stationary regime .",
    "the error bars correspond to the rms value of the departure from the mean .",
    "the slope in this plot corresponds to the parameter @xmath71 quoted in , which was derived following a minimum squares procedure .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the prediction arising from a two dimensional mhd model ( @xcite ) , @xmath72 , which is assumed to simulate the dynamics of a generic transverse slice of a loop .",
    "this coincidence between both scalings suggests that two dimensional simulations provide an adequate description of the dynamics of coronal loops ( see also @xcite ) , provided that the external forcing in is given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper we report preliminary results from a series of numerical simulations of the rmhd equations driven at their footpoints by stationary granule - size motions .",
    "the important results are summarized as follows :    * after a few photospheric turnover times , the system relaxes to a stationary turbulent regime , with dissipation rates consistent with the heating requirements of coronal active regions ( @xmath75 ) . *",
    "a dimensional analysis of the rmhd equations shows that the dimensionless heating rate does only depend on the ratio @xmath60 and the reynolds number .",
    "however , for turbulent systems at very large reynolds numbers , the heating rate is likely to be independent of the reynolds number . from a series of numerical simulations , we find that the heating rate scales with @xmath60 as @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 which might be useful for an observational test of this theoretical framework of coronal heating . *",
    "the dissipative structures observed in our simulations are current sheets elongated along the axis of the loop .",
    "the spatial and temporal distribution of these structures is rather intermittent , as expected for turbulent regimes .",
    "we associate these dissipation events taking place inside coronal loops to the _ nanoflares _ envisioned by @xcite , as a likely scenario for coronal heating ."
