    "blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by two distinct bumps .",
    "the low - energy component originates in a relativistic jet , and consists of relativistic electron synchrotron emission .",
    "the high - energy component could be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "various soft photon sources seed the ssc and ec processes in the jet to produce gamma rays .",
    "very high energy ( vhe ) photons emitted by extragalactic sources are absorbed , through the pair - production process , by interaction with extragalactic background light ( ebl ) @xcite .",
    "the rate of absorption is determined by the ebl photon density and the redshift of the vhe source .",
    "the energy range of interest for background photons is from optical to ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "since it is hard to measure the ebl directly , researchers have proposed three kinds of spectral models : low limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mean level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and high level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite discussed some @xmath0-ray blazars with unexpectedly hard spectra at large redshifts , and suggested that ebl is of the first type .",
    "@xcite found that the universe is more transparent to @xmath0-rays .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that @xcite do not significantly constrain the intergalactic low energy photon spectra and their high level ebl model is still valid . in an analysis of photons above 10 gev from @xmath0-ray sources detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat , @xcite found evidence to exclude the high level ebl model . by taking into account multi - frequency data ranging from radio to gev , the sed of a blazar can be extrapolated into the vhe region .",
    "the redshift of the vhe source can then be constrained by comparing the de - absorbed vhe spectrum with the extrapolated one .",
    "the accurate determination of such redshifts helps us understand both the nature of ebl and the intrinsic emission model of vhe sources .",
    "3c 66a is classified as intermediate bl lac ( ibl ) , because its synchrotron peak lies between @xmath1 hz and @xmath2 hz @xcite .",
    "the most widely used redshift for 3c 66a is 0.444 , based on a single emission line measurement @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite stated that they were not sure of the reality of this emission feature , and warned that the redshift was not reliable .",
    "later , @xcite confirmed the redshift of 0.444 based on data from _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the 3c 66a redshift determined using _ iue _ data is questionable .",
    "@xcite placed a lower limit on the redshift of 3c 66a , @xmath3 , using information regarding its host galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite concluded that the redshift of 3c 66a should be below @xmath4 , and that the most likely redshift is @xmath5 .",
