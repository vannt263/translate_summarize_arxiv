    "in summary , we showed that the quasi - energy spectrum of an otherwise ordinary band insulator irradiated by electromagnetic fields can exhibit non - trivial topological invariants and chiral edge modes .",
    "a realization of these ideas in zincblende systems , such as hgte / cdte semiconducting quantum wells , can lead to floquet topological insulators that support either co- or counter - propagating helical edge modes .",
    "the floquet operators of these realizations belong , respectively , to symmetry classes analogous to classes a ( no symmetry ) and aii ( time reversal symmetry with @xmath117 ) in @xcite .",
    "the symmetry class of the floquet topological insulator indeed requires careful consideration when two counter - propagating edge states are present , as in the oscillating magnetic - field realization suggested in the previous section . in time independent systems , topological phases exhibiting counter - propagating edges are only distinct from trivial phases under the restriction @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the anti - unitary time reversal operator satisfying @xmath117 . in the time - periodic case , the hamiltonian at any given time may not possess any symmetry under time reversal .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath129 .",
    "an oscillating magnetic field , being odd under time reversal , therefore obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq : condition ] ) and leads to two counter propagating edge modes .",
    "another important question that we did not touch upon is the non - equilibrium onset and steady states  @xcite of the driven systems .",
    "we emphasize that in the presence of the time dependent fields , response functions including hall conductivity will be determined not only by the spectrum of the floquet operator , but also by the distribution of electrons on this spectrum .",
    "these in turn depend on the specific relaxation mechanisms present in the system , such as electron - phonon mechanisms @xcite and electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation here is that the average energies of the edge modes lie in the original bandgap .",
    "one way to minimize the unwanted non - equilibrium heating effects would be to use an adiabatic build - up of the floquet topological insulator state , e.g. with the frequency of the modulation gradually increasing from zero .",
    "this should result , at least initially , in a filled lower floquet band .",
    "nevertheless , the scattering events will lead to a relaxation from the conduction band into the valence band of the original system and will always play role by producing mobile bulk quasi - particles . perhaps this relaxation could be suppressed by restricting the corresponding optical modes in the environment .",

    "<S> topological phase transitions between a conventional insulator and a state of matter with topological properties have been proposed and observed in mercury telluride - cadmium telluride quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a topological state can be induced in such a device , initially in the trivial phase , by irradiation with microwave frequencies , without closing the gap and crossing the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quasi - energy spectrum exhibits a single pair of helical edge states . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the edge states can be tuned by adjusting the intensity of the microwave radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the necessary experimental parameters for our proposal . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal provides an example and a proof of principle of a new non - equilibrium topological state , floquet topological insulator , introduced in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> topological phases of matter have captured our imagination over the past few years , with tantalizing properties such as robust edge modes and exotic non - abelian excitations @xcite , and potential applications ranging from semiconductor spintronics @xcite to topological quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of topological insulators in solid - state devices such as hgte / cdte quantum wells @xcite , and in materials such as @xmath0 @xcite brings us closer to employing the unique properties of topological phases in technological applications .    despite this success </S>",
    "<S> , however , the choice of materials that exhibit these unique topological properties remains rather scarce . in most cases we have to rely on serendipity in looking for topological materials in solid - state structures and our means to engineer hamiltonians there </S>",
    "<S> are very limited . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to develop new methods to achieve and control topological structures at will would be of great importance .    </S>",
    "<S> our work demonstrates that such new methods are indeed possible in non - equilibrium , where external time - dependent perturbations represent a rich and versatile resource that can be utilized to achieve topological spectra in systems that are topologically trivial in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that periodic - in - time perturbations may give rise to new differential operators with topological insulator spectra , dubbed floquet topological insulators ( fti ) , that exhibit chiral edge currents in non - equilibrium and possess other hallmark phenomena associated with topological phases . these ideas , </S>",
    "<S> put together with the highly developed technology for controlling low - frequency electromagnetic modes , can enable devices in which fast switching of edge state transport is possible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spectral properties of the edge states , i.e. , their velocity , and the bandgap of the bulk insulator , can be easily controlled . on a less applied perspective </S>",
    "<S> , the fast formation of the floquet topological insulators in response to the external field opens a path to study quench dynamics of topological states in solid - state devices .    </S>",
    "<S> the floquet topological insulators discussed here share many features discussed in some previous works : the idea of achieving topological states in a periodic hamiltonian was also explored from the perspective of quantum walks in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> also , a similar philosophy led to proposals for the realization of topological phases in cold - atom systems : a quantum hall state using a stroboscopic quadrupole field @xcite and a topological insulator state using a ramann - scattering induced spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed to use a circularly - polarized light field to induce a hall current in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> another useful analogy for our work is the formation of zero - resistance state in hall bars at low magnetic fields using rf radiation @xcite . in our case , it is not the resistance of the bulk that vanishes , but rather the resistance of the edges , which becomes finite and universal upon application of the light field . </S>",
    "<S> as we were finalizing our draft , we also became aware of ref . </S>",
    "<S> , which proposed to use a periodic modulation in the form of a circularly polarized light to change the chern number in the haldane model  @xcite . </S>"
