    "in recent years , the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres has become of both increasing interest and feasibility thanks to the large number of confirmed exoplanets and a burgeoning number of instruments capable of measuring the associated effects @xcite .",
    "transit spectroscopy and emission spectroscopy have emerged as the most widely used techniques to this end , with observers constraining the chemical composition of the atmospheres of several worlds to date ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the very large number of exoplanets , more than 850 at the time of writing ( www.exoplanet.eu ; @xcite ) , and the resource - intensive nature of the required observations to measure exoplanetary atmospheres ( e.g. @xcite ) mean that observers are forced to select only the most promising exoplanets for further study .",
    "this selection is typically based on the simple premise of focusing on those exoplanets where one should expect to detect the largest signal - to - noise ratio , e.g. , bright target stars and large - radius planets .",
    "increasingly , the study of small exoplanets ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) is becoming feasible , thanks to the discovery of transiting planets around small m - dwarf stars @xcite and the use of improved instrumentation @xcite .",
    "the study of the atmospheres of such small exoplanets will likely become increasingly prevalent as observers seek to push down to more telluric - like planets combined with the windfall of low - radius planets detected by _",
    "careful target selection for atmospheric characterization of these small exoplanets will therefore become crucial for future planned missions e.g. _ echo _ @xcite .",
    "one challenge with studying exoplanets with radii @xmath4-@xmath5@xmath3 is that such worlds straddle the boundary between rocky , terrestrial worlds ( `` super - earths '' ) and small gaseous planets ( `` mini - neptunes '' ) .",
    "naturally this classification has a significant impact on the prior probability of a detectable atmosphere and the interpretation of a spectrum . in traditional core accretion theory ,",
    "runaway gas accretion is predicted for planetary embryos exceeding @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite leading to large hydrogen / helium - dominated atmospheres . assuming a rocky / icy core , the @xmath6@xmath7 transition corresponds to @xmath8@xmath3 @xcite . for this reason , _ kepler _ s",
    "recent discovery @xcite of a large population of small exoplanets with radii close to this transition ( @xmath4-@xmath5@xmath3 ) , along with the apparently smooth distribution across this regime , was not generally expected .    in any case",
    ", an inescapable conclusion is that distinguishing whether a specific exoplanet is a mini - neptune or a rocky super - earth is not possible with a radius measurement alone .",
    "consequently , a catalogue of exoplanetary radii is insufficient for selecting targets for follow - up atmospheric characterization in the regime of @xmath4-@xmath5@xmath3 .",
    "another challenge is that it has become evident that many degeneracies exist in the process of spectral retrieval @xcite , particularly salient when the spectrum is relatively flat as in the case of gj 1214b for example @xcite . here",
    ", a flat spectrum can be considered consistent with either a low mean molecular weight atmosphere with clouds or a high mean molecular weight atmosphere yielding a low scale height .",
    "this invites the inclusion of additional priors to constrain the various models .    despite the described pains of interpreting super - earths / mini - neptunes ,",
    "there does exist at least one major advantage .",
    "specifically , a considerable range of the expected internal pressures of such worlds are achievable in the laboratory ( unlike jovian worlds ) , meaning that the phase diagrams of the constituent molecules in the planet s core can be empirically calibrated . accessing these pressures ( up to 100gpa )",
    "has only recently been achievable and was utilized in the recent revised mass - radius relationship presented by @xcite .",
    "such mass - radius relationships impose at least two hard boundary conditions : i ) a maximum @xmath9-@xmath10 contour for a pure - iron planet and ii ) a minimum @xmath9-@xmath10 contour for a pure - water planet . in principle , it is not expected to find an object with a mass exceeding that of boundary condition i ) , except for exotic states of matter found in the core of stars / stellar remnants .",
    "in contrast , it is possible to find an object with a mass below that of boundary condition ii ) but such an object must maintain an atmosphere , which might violate boundary condition ii ) , but such counterexamples seem implausible . ] .",
    "several effects such as intense irradiation and dissolved gas may affect the robustness of boundary condition ii ) and we will address these later in  [ sec : discussion ] .    here",
    ", we show how this low - density boundary condition set by the mass - radius relationship of super - earths provides a simple way to infer the minimum atmospheric height ( mah ) for an exoplanet by using just a precise measurement of the planet s mass ( @xmath9 ) and radius ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this determination serves to both identify promising targets for follow - up atmospheric characterization as well as identifying implausible solutions derived from blind spectral retrieval . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , we outline a simple , quantitative method to infer the confidence of a small planet having an atmosphere and the minimum atmospheric height . in  [ sec : examples ] , we apply the technique to several examples including gj  1214b . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the potential applications and limitations of our method .",
    "the simple premise of our method is that any small planet found to have a mass and radius locating it beyond the boundary condition of a pure - water planet must maintain an atmosphere .",
    "more specifically , if we find @xmath11 then the minimum atmospheric height ( mah ) is given by :    @xmath12    in this expression , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the observed planetary mass and radius and the latter should be be interpreted as the radius of the solid / liquid core of the planet plus any opaque atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath13 term denotes the theoretical radius of the planet composed purely from non - gaseous h@xmath14o ( given an observed mass @xmath9 ) and thus extends from the centre of the planet to the solid / liquid surface .",
    "an important caveat is that if a planet does not violate this boundary condition , our method says nothing about whether the planet does or does not have an atmosphere ] .    a typical analysis of a recently discovered super - earth / mini - neptune includes a mass - radius plot showing the various contours for different potential compositions and a cross marking the position of the new found planet .",
    "usually , the width and height of the cross denote the 68.3% quantile confidence range of the planet s mass and radius , respectively .",
    "consider that a planet resides slightly above the mass - radius contour of a 100% water planet .",
    "using just the @xmath9- and @xmath10-axis error bars , one can not reasonably estimate the confidence level of a planet being significantly above this contour , and thus maintaining an atmosphere .",
    "this is because the posterior joint probability distribution may be ( and often is ) non - gaussian , correlated and/or multi - modal .",
    "we propose calculating the term @xmath0 using realizations of @xmath9-@xmath10 drawn from the posterior joint probability distribution of the system parameters . in doing so",
    ", we sample the possible parameters consistent with the data in a statistically appropriate way and collapse the two - dimensional array into a one - dimensional vector describing the quantity of interest .      in this work",
    ", we estimate @xmath15 by interpolating the tables of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : zeng ] shows the 100%-h@xmath140 mass - radius relation in solid blue .",
    "realizations above this curve correspond to a positive @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate our interpolation by first selecting all @xmath9-@xmath10 entries in the @xcite catalogue corresponding to a 100%-h@xmath140 composition .",
    "plotting @xmath10 as a function of @xmath16 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeng ] ) reveals a smooth behaviour which may be fitted using a polynomial .",
    "we find that a seventh - order polynomial describes all of the features well and this function is supported over the range of masses provided in the @xcite catalogue for the 100%-h@xmath140 composition ; specifically @xmath17@xmath18@xmath7 .",
    "the functional form of our interpolation is given by    @xmath19^n , \\label{eqn : rh20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath20 coefficients are provided in table  [ tab : coeffs ] , derived using a simple least squares regression .",
    "although the 100%-h@xmath140 contour is a valid boundary condition , one can consider it to be somewhat overly conservative .",
    "a commonly assumed maximum initial water content is 75% ( e.g. @xcite ) and @xcite have shown that giant impacts can not increase the water fraction . a more realistic boundary condition , then , is to use 75%-h@xmath140 - 25%-mgsio@xmath21 .",
    "we again find a seventh - order polynomial in @xmath16 well describes the corresponding model from @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeng ] ( see table  [ tab : coeffs ] for the corresponding coefficients and table  [ tab : support ] for the supported range of this model ) .",
    "0 planet , blue - dashed is 75%-h@xmath140 - 25%-mgsio@xmath21 , brown is 100%-fe and brown - dashed is 75%-fe-25%-mgsio@xmath21.__,width=317 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : examples ]",
    "in this short paper , we have presented a simple , quantitative method to infer the minimum atmospheric height of an atmosphere ( mah ) for an exoplanet using just a precise ( and accurate ) mass and radius measurement . in cases",
    "where the the @xmath1 with high confidence , one infers the presence of an exoplanet atmosphere without ever taking a spectrum of the planet .",
    "we envision that this metric will aid in the interpretation of exoplanet transit spectra by providing an additional boundary condition . for a given interior mass and radius ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , and a given total mass and ( transit ) radius ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) ,",
    "there are various possible atmospheric compositions . imposing the constraint that the atmosphere should not be denser than the interior implies that some possible chemical compositions of the atmosphere are disallowed .",
    "loosely speaking , one can think of a maximum mean molecular weight @xmath24 for each possible `` boundary condition '' vector @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the atmospheric temperature at the transit radius .",
    "however , determining @xmath27 $ ] would require a specific equation of state for each possible composition . in principle ,",
    "the information in fig .  [ fig : gj1214 ] , for the example of gj  1214b , is sufficient to allow for a calculation of @xmath24 , but this exercise is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but it seems clear that , as has been appreciated previously for gj  1214b , light ( h / he ) and moderately heavy ( e.g. , h@xmath14o ) atmospheres are consistent with the data but , since the atmosphere appears to be @xmath2820% the radius of the planet , compositions much heavier than h@xmath14o are disfavoured .",
    "the simplicity and observationally `` cheap '' nature of determining @xmath0 makes the metric attractive for general use within the exoplanet community .",
    "however , we do caution here that there are several limitations to appreciate when interpreting the minimum atmospheric height .",
    "most importantly , the determination is fundamentally a model - dependent one , where in this work we used the models of @xcite .",
    "their model results rely on the most recent equations of states and experimental or theoretically determined properties of the bulk planetary materials .",
    "these will undoubtedly improve in the future and some dramatic surprises can not be excluded , though appear unlikely . however , as far as our proposed method is concerned , it is trivial to replace this model with whatever mass - radius relation one prefers",
    ".    considering the mass range of super - earths , the boundary condition of a minimum contour of a pure - water planet , might still undergo significant correction in the planet models .",
    "apart from the trivial uncertainty due to not knowing what is the maximum allowable water fraction ( from formation and evolution ) , there is little understanding of the amount of mixing that could occur between a water and a h / he envelope ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that this occurs at a particular narrow range of pressures , and hence will be dependent on planetary mass , introducing additional structure in the mass - radius diagram .    aside from aiding in the interpretation of exoplanetary spectra",
    ", our metric provides a quick and cost - effective method to assist in the selection and planning of follow - up atmospheric characterization for exoplanets .",
    "this is particularly important in light of the burgeoning catalogue of exoplanets and the upcoming planned missions for exoplanet characterization such as echo @xcite",
    ". it should be trivial for observers to calculate @xmath0 from their parameter posteriors ( using equation  [ eqn : rmah ] , equation  [ eqn : rh20 ] and coefficients from table  [ tab : coeffs ] ) and thus provide a statistically meaningful statement regarding the presence of an extended atmosphere , which will surely aid in the selection and planning of follow - up observations .",
