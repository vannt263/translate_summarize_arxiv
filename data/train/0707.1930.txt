    "the astrod i ( astrodynamical space test of relativity using optical devices i ) mission concept is a down - scaled version of astrod",
    ". the main objectives of astrod i are : to improve the precision of measurement of solar - system dynamics , solar - system constants and ephemeris ; to measure the relativistic gravitational effects ; to test the fundamental laws of space - time more precisely and to improve the measurement of the rate of change of the gravitational constant with time.@xcite    the basic scheme of the astrod i space mission is to use two - way laser interferometric ranging and laser pulse ranging between a drag - free astrod i spacecraft in a solar orbit and deep space laser stations on earth .",
    "the astrod i spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized with a total mass of 300 - 350 kg .",
    "the mass of the payload is 100 - 120 kg .",
    "the science data rate is 500 bps .",
    "the spacecraft is cylindrical with od ( outer diameter ) 2.5 m and height 2 m and has its side surface covered with solar panels . in orbit , the cylindrical axis will be perpendicular to the orbit plane with the telescope pointing toward the ground laser station .",
    "the effective area to receive sunlight is about 5 m@xmath3 and can generate over 500 w of power.@xcite@xcite the spacecraft will be launched into the solar orbit from a low earth orbit .",
    "the injection correction will be made using a medium - sized ion thruster .",
    "a launch on august 4 , 2010 would provide a suitable orbit .",
    "the orbit in the x - y plane of the heliocentric ecliptic coordinate system is shown in figure 1.@xcite@xmath4@xcite this solar orbit will initially have a period of 290 days .",
    "after two gravity - assist encounters with venus , the period will be shortened to about 165 days .",
    "after about 370 days from launch , the spacecraft will arrive at the other side of the sun .",
    "the spacecraft will have the first closest approach to venus 107.8 days after launch with a distance of 31606.0 km to the centre of venus .",
    "the spacecraft crosses the venus trajectory in front of venus and gets a swing toward the sun to achieve the venus orbital period .",
    "after the first encounter , the spacecraft has the same orbit s period as venus and encounters venus again after about 1 period ( 224.7 days ) with a closest approach distance of 16151.7 km from the centre of venus.@xcite@xcite    to achieve its goal , the astrod i residual acceleration noise target is : @xmath5\\ \\mathrm{ms^{-2}hz^{-1/2 } } , \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] over the frequency range of 0.1 mhz @xmath6 100 mhz.@xcite here @xmath7 is the residual acceleration noise spectral density .",
    "it is compared to the lisa pathfinder lisa technology package,@xcite lisa@xcite and astrod@xcite noise target curves in figure 2 .",
    "the test mass is key to guarantee the drag - free condition for astrod i. it is a 1.75 kg , rectangular parallelepiped , made of an extremely low magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath8 ) au - pt alloy , to minimize magnetic disturbances .",
    "the test mass is placed in the centre of spacecraft and surrounded by electrodes on all six sides .",
    "any relative displacement of test mass to the surrounding electrodes will be capacitively detected and the spacecraft will follow it using feep ( field emission electric propulsion ) to ensure drag - free flight . cosmic rays and solar energetic particles will easily penetrate the light shielding of the spacecraft to transfer heat , momentum and electrical charge to the test mass .",
    "electrical charging is the most significant of these disturbances .",
    "it will result in forces on the test mass , due to coulomb and lorentz interactions , which will disturb the geodesic motion .",
    "the characteristics of the test mass charging process depend on the incident flux , spacecraft geometry and the physical processes that occur .",
    "the three main disturbances associated with this charge are an increase in the test mass acceleration noise , coupling between the test mass and the spacecraft and the appearance of coherent fourier components in the measurement bandwidth.@xcite to limit the acceleration noise associated with coulomb and lorentz forces to meet the astrod i noise requirement , the test mass must be discharged in orbit .",
    "our previous work predicted the charging rates for astrod i test mass from galactic cosmic rays at solar minimum using a simplified geometry , and using these predictions , estimated the magnitude of disturbances associated with charging.@xcite in this paper , we present the detailed calculation of the astrod i net test mass charging rate and shot noise , due to cosmic rays at solar minimum and solar maximum , with a more realistic geometry model . based on these results",
    ", we estimate the magnitude of acceleration noise , stiffness and the coherent signals associated with charging .",
    "we have simulated the fluxes of the 3 most abundant primaries , proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1he primary particles which represent approximately 98% of the total cosmic ray flux .",
    "near - earth cosmic ray spectra were adopted , as used in similar lisa simulations .",
    "these are shown in figure 3.@xcite    the primary particles are generated from points sampled uniformly from a spherical surface of 3000 mm diameter , encompassing the whole astrod i geometry model .",
    "the total time @xmath9 for bombardment by @xmath10 primaries is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the integral flux ( unit : particles / cm@xmath3/s ) for each species at solar minimum or solar maximum , and @xmath14 mm .",
    "the @xmath15 particle event occurs at time @xmath16.@xcite the effects on charging of other particle species ( c , n , o , e@xmath17 ) are determined separately , based on a lisa study.@xcite work is under way to study the impact on the charging disturbances from variations in the incident flux due to the astrod i heliocentric position changes .",
    "test mass charging depends heavily on the physics processes that occur during the passage of the particles through matter and the geometry model used in simulation .",
    "the geant4 toolkit employs monte carlo particle ray - tracing techniques to follow all primary and secondary particles . due to their high energy and hadronic nature",
    ", cosmic rays can produce the complex nuclear reactions which have large final - state multiplicities , producing many secondary particles .",
    "a low energy threshold of 250 ev was imposed for secondary particle production in our simulation .",
    "the physics processes simulated include electromagnetic , hadronic and photonuclear interactions .",
    "fluorescence and non - radiative ( auger ) atomic deexcitation have been implemented . the hadronic physics is mainly implemented by elastic and inelastic scattering processes .",
    "the inelastic reactions were based on the lep ( low energy particles ) and hep ( high energy particles ) parameterized models .",
    "the inelastic reactions also use evaporation models to treat the deexcitation of nuclei with a @xmath18 16 , comprising gamma emission , fragment evaporation ( p , n , @xmath19 , @xmath3h and @xmath0h ) and fission of heavier residual nuclei .",
    "a variety of decay , capture and annihilation processes has also been included in our physics processes list based on lisa geant4 model of araujo et al.@xcite the charging potential of several additional physics processes , such as the kinetic emission of very low energy electrons which has not been modeled in the present simulation , has been assessed based on lisa studies.@xcite      the basic payload configuration of astrod i is sketched in ref .",
    "the geometry model built for astrod i using geant4 in present work is sketched in figure 4 and figure 5 .",
    "table 1 lists the dimensions and weight of main constituent parts of the astrod i geometry model . table 2 lists the composition and density of materials used in the model .",
    "the cylindrical structure of the spacecraft consists of a layer with diameter 2.5 m , height 2 m and thickness 10 mm made of cfrp ( carbon fibre reinforced plastic ) honeycomb .",
    "the top and bottom of the spacecraft are covered by the upper deck and lower deck . to prevent sunlight from striking the inside directly and to reduce the temperature perturbation inside ,",
    "all surfaces of spacecraft are covered by a thermal shield consistent of five layers of materials ( face sheet , honey comb core , face sheet , foam , face sheet ) .",
    "the edges of upper deck and thermal shield are shown as large ellipses in figure 4 .",
    "the inner lower deck is shown as the grey part in figure 4 and figure 5 .",
    "the payload structure is used for shielding the optical bench , inertial sensor and primary telescope etc . the primary telescope , which collects the incoming light is a 500 mm diameter f/1 cassegrain telescope.@xcite some 30 boxes represent the components above @xmath20 0.1 kg based on the payload configuration.@xcite the mass of the spacecraft and payload are estimated as 341 kg and 109 kg in this study .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]     [ ta1 ]    a @xmath21 mm@xmath0 test mass is at the centre of the spacecraft .",
    "the test mass is housed inside capacitance sensors located in optical bench mounted behind the telescope .",
    "the test mass is surrounded by sensing and actuation electrodes lodged in a molybdenum housing .",
    "a 0.3  @xmath22 m gold layer is plated on the entire inner surface of the sensor housing .",
    "the assembly is accommodated in a titanium vacuum ( @xmath23pa ) enclosure .",
    "the gap between test mass and electrodes along x axis or y axis is 4 mm ; that along z axis is 2 mm.@xcite the geant4 model for inertial sensor is shown in figure 6 .",
    "we have run 6 independent geant4 simulations to determine the charging of the astrod i test mass by cosmic ray protons , @xmath0he and @xmath1he , at solar minimum and maximum . in total",
    ", about 8,500,000 events were simulated .",
    "the details of each event that resulted in test mass charging were recorded , including the event time , net charge deposited on the test mass and the energy of the primary .",
    "the variation of the net test mass charge with time , due to gcr proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1he fluxes are shown respectively in figure 7 , figure 8 and figure 9 at solar minimum and maximum .",
    "the straight lines in these figures correspond to least squares fits of the simulated data , giving mean net charging rates attributable to the proton , @xmath0he and @xmath1he fluxes .",
    "the proton flux is responsible for positive charging rates of 26.5 @xmath24 0.5 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum and 9.0 @xmath24 0.5 e@xmath2/s at solar maximum ; the @xmath0he flux is responsible for positive charging rates of 0.8 @xmath24 0.05 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum and 0.3 @xmath24 0.05 e@xmath2/s at solar maximum ; the @xmath1he flux is responsible for positive charging rates of 6.0 @xmath24 0.20 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum and 2.4 @xmath24 0.20 e@xmath2/s at solar maximum .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are only associated with the monte carlo fluctuations .",
    "our simulation indicates that @xmath20 97% of the charge accumulated comes from primary cosmic ray protons and @xmath1he at both solar minimum and maximum and all three fluxes lead to positive charging of the test mass .",
    "the proton flux dominates these rates .",
    "however , @xmath1he , which constitutes only 8% of the total cosmic rays flux , is responsible for @xmath20 18% of the test mass charging at solar minimum and @xmath20 20% at solar maximum .",
    "two histograms of the net charge deposited in an event are given in figure 10 and figure 11 , for the proton data set , showing that most events result in the transfer of one unit of charge .",
    "the effects of the positive and negative chargings cancel to some extent .",
    "an imbalance in these currents gives rise to the net positive charging rate .",
    "the charging rate is plotted as a function of primary energy in figure 12 .",
    "the low energy cut - off is due to the shielding provided by the spacecraft , which prevents incident protons with energies below @xmath20 100 mev from charging the test mass . at solar minimum , the most significant charging",
    "mechanism is primary cosmic ray particles stopping in the test mass .",
    "this occurs mainly for protons of energy between @xmath20 100 - 720 mev .",
    "protons with energies in excess of @xmath20 720 mev have sufficient energy to traverse the distance through the spacecraft to the test mass and the longest path through the test mass , without being stopped .",
    "this explains the peak observed in this energy interval in figure 12 at solar minimum .",
    "the scenario at solar maximum is distinct : a peak is visible at higher energies because the primary proton flux peak shifts towards higher energy .",
    "in addition to the monte carlo uncertainty , we added an error of @xmath2430% in the net charging rates to account for uncertainties in the gcr spectra , physics models and geometry implementation .",
    "further , based on lisa studies@xcite@xmath4@xcite , a potential contribution to the charging rate of 28.4 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum and of 17.0 e@xmath2/s at solar maximum from kinetic low energy secondary electron emission should be considered ; the effect of cosmic ray fluxes of particle species not included in this simulation is expected to increase the net charging rate by @xmath20 4.2% at solar minimum and @xmath20 7.3% at solar maximum@xcite .",
    "following to ref .",
    "12 , the charging flux is considered to be made up of independent currents , @xmath25 , each composed solely of charges @xmath26 ( @xmath27=+1 for protons ) , with shot noise of single - sided spectral density @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the magnitude of electron charge . the total noise , @xmath30 , is then given by the quadrature sum of @xmath31 , over all values of @xmath27 .",
    "considering the monte carlo currents alone , @xmath31 = 17.6 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar minimum and @xmath31 = 9.6 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar maximum .",
    "based on the lisa study@xcite , low energy secondary electron emission is estimated to contribute an extra 10.3 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar minimum and 8.0 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar maximum ; the charging noises from other species ( c , n , o , e@xmath17 ) are estimated to be 8.9 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar minimum and 3.7 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar maximum . integrating in the time domain gives the charging fluctuations at frequency @xmath34 , @xmath35 the charging rate and noise contributions from the different sources mentioned above are summarized in table 3 . given the results in table 3 , by adding the contributions of all the independent sources , we estimate the total worst case charging rate to be 73.8 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum and 33.8 e@xmath2/s at solar maximum . the total worst case noise is 22.3 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar minimum and 13.0 es@xmath32hz@xmath33 at solar maximum .",

    "the charging of the test mass may also result in the appearance of unwanted , coherent fourier components in the astrod i measurement bandwidth through coulomb and lorentz interactions , due to the time dependence of the amount of charge accumulated on the test mass .",
    "it is shown that the signals associated with lorentz interactions are expected to fall below the astrod i test mass residual acceleration noise , but the signals from coulomb interactions may exceed both the instrumental noise over a fraction of the bandwidth , and may not be eliminated by daily discharging of the test mass .",
    "the free charge on the test mass at time @xmath83 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath84    where @xmath83 is the time for which the test mass has been allowed to charge and @xmath85 is the mean charging rate . here",

    "<S> the electrostatic charging of the test mass in astrod i ( astrodynamical space test of relativity using optical devices i ) mission can affect the quality of the science data as a result of spurious coulomb and lorentz forces . to estimate the size of the resultant disturbances , credible predictions of charging rates and the charging noise </S>",
    "<S> are required . using the geant4 software toolkit , we present a detailed monte carlo simulation of the astrod i test mass charging due to exposure of the spacecraft to galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) protons and alpha particles ( @xmath0he , @xmath1he ) in the space environment . a positive charging rate of 33.3 e@xmath2/s at solar minimum is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this figure reduces by 50% at solar maximum . </S>",
    "<S> based on this charging rate and factoring in the contribution of minor cosmic - ray components , we calculate the acceleration noise and stiffness associated with charging . we conclude that the acceleration noise arising from coulomb and lorentz effects are well below the astrod i acceleration noise limit at 0.1 mhz both at solar minimum and maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent fourier components due to charging are investigated , it needs to be studied carefully in order to ensure that these do not compromise the quality of science data in the astrod i mission . </S>"
