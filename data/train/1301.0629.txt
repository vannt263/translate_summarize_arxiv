    ".    observed features in x - ray lightcurves suggest longevity of the central engine of grbs , for example late time flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "grbs whose x - ray lightcurves have a steep decay and a plateau phase followed by a standard afterglow phase , have been identified as `` canonical '' lightcurves @xcite .",
    "the steep decay phase is associated with high latitude emission from the prompt emission followed by a late emission plateau giving the plateau phase @xcite .",

    "although studies of flares and plateaus are typically conducted for lgrbs , fainter versions are evident in many sgrb x - ray lightcurves suggesting a long lived central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is problematic for sgrb progenitor theories as accretion is expected to end within a few seconds ( powering relativistic jets ; * ? ? ?",

    "additionally , it is thought that the accretion disk gets destroyed after a few seconds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there have been studies of fallback accretion , in which the ns is shredded and parts ( @xmath203 10% of the original disk mass ) are flung into highly eccentric orbits which accrete onto the central engine at late times giving flares in the x - ray lightcurve @xcite .",
    "flares may also be caused by toomre instabilities within the accretion disk @xcite , although this does not explain plateau emission or late time flares as the sgrb accretion disks are expected to accrete within the first few seconds . @xcite",
    "have attempted to explain plateaus by introducing a band of material at a large distance from the central engine .",
    "@xcite suggest that the required reservoir of material could be provided via the accretion disk moving outwards ( due to having a large amount of angular momentum ) or ejecta thrown out during the merger in highly eccentric orbits that circularises forming an accretion disk .",
    "an alternative theory is that during some grbs a millisecond pulsar ( magnetar ) may be formed with enough rotational energy to prevent gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the rotational energy is released as gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation , causing the magnetar to spin down .",
    "if the magnetar is sufficiently massive it may reach a critical point at which differential rotation is no longer able to support it , resulting in collapse to a bh . assuming constant radiative efficiency",
    ", the energy injection from the magnetar would produce a plateau in the x - ray light curve @xcite and would be followed by a steep decay if the magnetar collapses to a bh .",
    "the progenitor of this system is typically thought to be a collapsar and lgrb candidates have been identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been proposed that such a magnetar could be formed by the merger of two neutron stars @xcite or via the accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite .",
    "a candidate event for this is grb 090515 with an unusual x - ray plateau followed by a steep decay @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of producing this event is dependent on the equation of state of neutron stars .",
    "@xcite studied the effect that the equation of state of a ns and rotation would have on the remnant of a compact merger , i.e. whether a ns or a bh is formed ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they showed that , even for the harder nuclear equations of state , the rotation of the ns could increase the maximum mass by @xmath204 and hence mergers could often result in a ns .",

    "adligo predictions by @xcite are for ns - ns mergers .    using the lowest and maximum possible rates for ns - ns mergers per milky way equivalent galaxy from @xcite , it is possible to predict the number of unstable magnetars ( i.e. one source giving 2 distinct gravitational wave signals ) we might expect to detect with adligo and et . to detect all the stages for the formation and collapse of a magnetar , adligo would require it to be at a distance @xmath208100 mpc and et would require @xmath2081300 mpc . within these volumes there is predicted to be a ns - ns merger rate of @xmath555 ",
    "@xmath556 yr@xmath152 for adligo and @xmath557 ",
    "@xmath558 yr@xmath152 for et . however , the rates need modification as not all ns - ns mergers will lead to an unstable magnetar which will give both signals . from the analysis in this paper , only 11 sgrbs in the total sample of 28 magnetar candidates ( 39% , assuming ns - ns mergers always produce a magnetar )",
    "are thought to form unstable magnetars , giving rates of @xmath559 ",
    "@xmath560 yr@xmath152 for adligo and @xmath561 ",
    "@xmath562 yr@xmath152 for et .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that adligo or lcgt will observe both the formation and collapse of an unstable magnetar but et should detect many cases . on a more optimistic note , @xcite estimate that adligo will be able to detect a post - merger signal associated with a newly formed massive ns with a rate of 0.015  1.2 yr@xmath152 .",
    "@xcite also study different masses relative to the maximum mass of a ns .",
    "they determined that if @xmath563 then the ns will emit gravitational waves during the magnetar spindown phase until it is a stable sphere and collapse to a black hole is dependant on the gravitational wave emission ( possibly collapsing within 50 ms ) or on forces such as magnetic breaking . in this case , they predict that advanced gravitational wave detectors will be able to observe these events out to 50 mpc using detectors such as adligo .",
    "alternatively if @xmath564 , then it collapses rapidly to spherical shape and hence is more likely to create a stable ns which may collapse at late times due to magnetic breaking .",
    "the gravitational waves from the more massive ns would be detectable to 10 mpc .    in both @xcite and @xcite , instabilities in the ns formed by a compact merger",
    "produce detectable gravitational waves in contrast to the spherical collapse model of @xcite .",
    "however @xcite showed that accretion may have an important affect on the gravitational wave signal .",
    "therefore , these objects are potentially important sources of gravitational waves and further analysis combining all these factors and the new limits on maximum ns masses is required .",
    "the predictions by @xcite do not take into account the loss of energy via gravitational waves and this may play a significant role for the formation of a magnetar via the merger of two nss .",
    "some of our candidates have shorter plateau durations than predicted by @xcite however if the energy losses via gravitational waves are more significant then the magnetar will spin down more rapidly .",
    "we have analysed the bat - xrt lightcurves of all the _ swift _ grbs with prompt durations @xmath565 s detected until may 2012 .",
    "about half of these sgrbs require fitting with a broken powerlaw model showing a plateau phase .",
    "although the plateau phases show many similarities with those observed in lgrb lightcurves , they are typically orders of magnitude earlier .",
    "the initial temporal indicies ( @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) are comparable to those found for the `` canonical '' lgrbs but there is much more variation in the final decay ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the correlation between luminosity and duration of the plateau phase is found to be consistent with the identified correlation for `` canonical '' lgrb lightcurves identified by @xcite .    following on from the study of grb 090515",
    ", this work has shown that the x - ray lightcurves of some sgrbs considered could be explained with energy injection from a magnetar which can collapse to form a bh .",
    "18 firm candidates ( @xmath566 ) and 10 possible candidates were found . of the 18 firm candidates ,",
    "10 are thought to collapse to form a bh and when including possible candidates , 11 out of 28 magnetar candidates may collapse to form a bh .",
    "this implies that @xmath567@xmath568 of events forming magnetars would collapse to a bh within the first few hundred seconds . in some cases",
    "the magnetar plateau phase is not directly observed as it occurs prior to the xrt observations .",
    "this predicts plateau emission that may be observable with future missions that are able to slew faster than _",
    "swift_.    the x - ray fluxes at 1000 s and 10000 s are typically higher for the stable magnetar candidates .",
    "the late time fluxes are significantly lower for the unstable magnetar cases .",
    "there is excess emission in the x - ray afterglows not observed in the optical afterglows for many of the magnetar sample .",
    "many of the magnetar candidates lie within or close to the predicted regions for plateau luminosity and duration for newly formed magnetars given in @xcite .",
    "accretion onto the newly formed magnetar formed by a ns - ns binary merger has a negligible affect on the spin periods and hence the rotational energy budget of the magnetar .",
    "however , it can be shown that accretion can have a significant affect for collapsar progenitors .",
    "this may explain late time flares for collapsar progenitors and our calculations suggest the rotational energy budget could exceed @xmath569 erg for some combinations of initial spin periods and magnetic fields .",
    "the unstable magnetar candidates , those which collapse to form a bh , are potentially accreting more material than the stable candidates .",
    "we suggest this is an additional solution for why they collapse at late times which would work alongside the theory that the magnetar spins down to a critical point where it can no longer support its mass using rotation .",
    "these objects are highly interesting targets for future gravitational wave observatories as they are predicted to emit gravitational waves during merger , the magnetar phase ( likely to be increased via accretion and bar mode instabilities ) and , in some cases , the final collapse to form a bh . in this paper , we have focused on ns - ns merger progenitors , however the accretion induced collapse of a wd could also produce a sgrb and leave behind a rapidly rotating magnetar with similar x - ray emission properties . among other observational signatures , the very different gravitational wave signals between these events may someday allow these progenitors to be distinguished however the inspiral remains the most luminous phase of gravitational wave emission .    for the candidates which form a stable magnetar , @xcite showed that the amount of energy available for an sgr giant flare is @xmath570 erg .",
    "hence a young magnetar , with a magnetic field of @xmath571 , could produce a giant flare with an energy of @xmath572 erg .",
    "this value is comparable to the isotropic energy of some sgrbs ( e.g. grb 080905a at @xmath573 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so would be observable in the local universe .",
    "both of the merger and giant flare events are very rare , however considering these models it is possible ( although very unlikely ) that in the future we may have two spatially co - incident sgrbs .",
    "this has also been proposed for lgrbs by@xcite and they suggest that these magnetar candidates could be identified by discovering an old spatially coincident radio grb afterglow in nearby galaxies .    we have shown that a model of sgrb production from binary ns mergers that result in the formation of a magnetar can explain the plateaus seen in many sgrb x - ray lightcurves .",
    "although this is not conclusive proof of such a model , it would tie in to the evidence for late time central engine activity in sgrbs and may have important observational consequences .",

    "<S> a significant fraction of the long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) in the _ swift _ sample have a plateau phase showing evidence of ongoing energy injection . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that many short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) detected by the _ swift _ satellite also show evidence of energy injection . </S>",
    "<S> explaining this observation within the typical sgrb progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion , often used to explain plateaus in lgrbs , is likely to be absent from the sgrb population . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it is predicted that the remnant of ns - ns mergers may not collapse immediately to a bh ( or even collapse at all ) , forming instead an unstable millisecond pulsar ( magnetar ) which powers a plateau phase in the x - ray lightcurve .    by fitting the magnetar model to all of the _ swift _ </S>",
    "<S> sgrbs observed until may 2012 , we find that about half can be clearly fitted with a magnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetar but the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase . </S>",
    "<S> more data , both at early times and a larger sample , are required to confirm this . </S>",
