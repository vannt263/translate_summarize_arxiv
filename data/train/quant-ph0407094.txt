    "in the classical paper by dicke @xcite , super- and subradiance in a collection of two - level atoms was studied in the near - field regime from a theoretical point of view . within the same near - field limit",
    ", the topic has subsequently been reviewed by a couple of authors @xcite , with a comprehensive study of subradiance being given in the series of papers @xcite . while wigner functions , squeezing properties and decoherence of collective states in the near - field regime have been presented in @xcite , triggering of sub- and superradiant states",
    "was shown to be possible in @xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of super- and subradiance was reported in @xcite .",
    "the near - field limit utilized in these examples is called the `` small - sample approximation '' , the term deriving from the fact that the atoms are assumed to be so close together that they are all subject to the same phase of the radiation field . in this approximation ,",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is independent of the spatial location of the atomic constituents , similar to a long - wavelength approximation .",
    "in contrast , our work presented here focuses on super - and subradiance in highly symmetric atomic systems with arbitrarily large interatomic distances .",
    "while in the first part of this report we deal with the theory of simply - excited correlated states in an arbitrary sample of atoms , in the second part we shall mainly be concerned with subradiance and , in particular , with the radiation - trapping capability , of circular and linear - chain atomic configurations .",
    "this radiation trapping is a consequence of collective states of the atomic sample which can have extremely small spontaneous decay rates as compared to the single - atomic decay rate ; these states therefore are natural candidates for _ single - photon traps_.    as mentioned above we are mainly interested in the decay of _ simply - excited _ states of the atomic sample ; these states may be conceptualized as follows : consider @xmath0 identical two - level atoms with infinite mutual distances such that precisely one of the atoms is excited , all others being in the ground state . if we now think of adiabatically decreasing the distances , the atoms will begin to interact with each other via their coupling to the radiation field , and hence the excitation , which previously was localized at one atom only , will distribute over the whole sample .",
    "the resulting states therefore will be superpositions of the excited levels in the atoms in such a way that the atomic sample still contains the energy of one ( more or less resonant ) photon , but this energy is now delocalized over the whole sample .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of this delocalization , the atoms will be strongly entangled with each other as well as with the radiation field .",
    "some of these correlated states turn out to be capable of very strong suppression of spontaneous decay ; this radiation trapping is one of the main topics of this work .",
    "we shall start with justifying our choice of gauge and the quantum picture utilized in the quantization of the system atoms+radiation .",
    "we then motivate a split of the state space into @xmath8- and @xmath9-photon states which will be convenient for formulating the decay of a correlated state in the collectively excited atomic sample .",
    "we shall see how the @xmath10 symmetry of the configuration can be utilized to diagonalize the effective hamiltonian of the atomic degrees of freedom on the subspaces carrying the irreducible representations of the symmetry group @xmath10 ; since , for simply - excited states , these subspaces are only one- or two - dimensional , the problem of diagonalization then becomes trivial and can be carried out analytically , producing both the complex eigenvalues , and the associated eigenvectors , of the effective channel hamiltonian .",
    "we then use this theory to illustrate the mechanism behind super- and subradiance ; in particular we show that the divergence of level shifts for vanishing interatomic distance is due to the coulomb dipole - dipole interaction only .",
    "it will be demonstrated that , for an ensemble with @xmath0 outer atoms in a circular configuration , there are @xmath11 states which are insensitive to the presence of a central atom : the properties of the quasi - particle describing the collective excitation do not change when the atom at the center is removed , simply because the latter is not occupied . on the other hand , the two states in a circular ensemble which do occupy the central atom are analogous to the @xmath4-state wave functions in hydrogen - like systems : just as the @xmath4 states carry angular momentum quantum number @xmath12 and therefore transform under the identity representation of @xmath13 , our collective @xmath6 states correspond to the identity representation of the symmetry group @xmath10 ; and just as the @xmath4 states are the only ones which are nonvanishing at the center - of - symmetry of the coulomb potential in a hydrogen - like system , so are our @xmath6 states the only quasi - particle states which occupy the central atom at the center - of - symmetry of the circle .",
    "quantum beats between two extreme @xmath6 states are possible , one , in which only outer atoms are occupied , the other , in which only the central atom is excited . at certain radii of the circle ,",
    "the two @xmath6 levels cross , and the beat frequency vanishes , making the population transfer between the extreme configurations aperiodic .",
    "moreover , we show numerically that , by increasing the number of atoms in the circle for fixed radius , we arrive at a domain where the minimal spontaneous decay rate in the sample decreases exponentially with the number of atoms in the circle .",
    "the associated subradiant states of the atomic sample will therefore qualify as _ single - photon traps_. in this examination , a critical inter - atomic distance of one - half of the dominant wavelength emerges .",
    "finally , we show that the same critical distance emerges in a linear - chain configuration of atoms : here , it signifies a jump - like , almost discontinuous , behaviour of the minimal spontaneous decay rate , from close to zero to finite values .",
    "we first formulate the decay of a simply - excited correlated state in a sample of @xmath0 neutral identical two - level atoms , arranged in an arbitrary planar pattern , such that all atomic dipole moments are aligned perpendicularly to the plane .",
    "the atoms are labelled by @xmath14 , each atom being localized around a center - of - mass @xmath15 in space .",
    "these locations are regarded as fixed in the sense that the associated center - of - mass degrees of freedom do not take part in the dynamics ; as a consequence , the quantities @xmath15 are @xmath16-numbers , not operators .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be identical , having a spatial extent on the order of magnitude of a bohr radius @xmath17 , and consist of point charges which are labelled as @xmath18 . with respect to wavelengths associated with optical transitions",
    "it is legitimate to ignore the spatial variation of the electromagnetic field over the extension @xmath17 of each atom , so that we may replace the field degrees of freedom @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "this step constitutes the _ long - wavelength approximation_. for reasons of consistency we then must also replace the _ inter_-atomic coulomb energy by its lowest - order multipole approximation , which is the dipole - dipole energy @xmath21 . after canonical quantization",
    ", the _ gppert - mayer transformation _ yields the _ electric - dipole hamiltonian _    [ su2 ] @xmath22    here the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath23 , given in ( [ su2a ] ) , contains the sum over atomic hamiltonians @xmath24 including the coulomb interaction @xmath25 between the internal constituents of atoms @xmath26 , but without the coulomb dipole - dipole interaction @xmath27 between atoms @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for @xmath30 ; and the normally - ordered free field energy . since the charge ensembles @xmath31 are assumed to have mutual distances @xmath32 which are much larger than the typical extension @xmath17 of the atomic or molecular wavefunctions , wavefunctions belonging to different ensembles do not overlap . as a consequence , atomic operators associated with different ensembles commute , @xmath33 = 0 \\quad , \\quad \\text{for $ a\\neq b$ }   \\quad.\\ ] ] the electric - dipole interaction is given in ( [ su2b ] ) , where @xmath34 denotes the transverse electric field operator .",
    "the interatomic coulomb dipole - dipole interaction @xmath27 seems to be conspicuously absent in ( [ su2 ] ) ; however , it is a feature of the gppert - mayer transformation ( and more generally , of the power - zienau - woolley transformation yielding leading to the multipolar hamiltonian ) to transform this interaction into a part of the transverse electric field , so that the coulomb interaction emerges in _ fully retarded _ form as a part of the level - shift operator on the radiationless subspace of the system .",
    "this will be seen in formulae  ( [ proc26 ]  [ proc28 ] ) below , thus clarifying that the _ inter_-atomic coulomb interaction @xmath27 is certainly contained in the hamiltonian  ( [ su2 ] ) , albeit in a nonobvious way .",
    "the simply - excited _ uncorrelated _ states of the sample are the product states @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 denote the ground and excited level of the @xmath28th atom , and @xmath40 is the radiative vacuum .",
    "the states @xmath41 are supposed to be electronic excitations , corresponding to the fact that the exchanged photons will have optical wavelengths . in the discussion before eq .",
    "( [ su1a ] ) we pointed out that the typical interatomic distance in the sample should be comparable to an optical wavelength , so that electronic wavefunctions belonging to excitations of different atoms will certainly not overlap ; as a consequence we can refrain from using antisymmetrized electronic states ( slater determinants ) and use simple product states to describe the atomic sample .",
    "the simply - excited uncorrelated states @xmath42 are coupled to the continuum of one - photon states @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the wave vector and @xmath4 denotes the polarization of the photon . as mentioned above",
    ", the simply - excited correlated states will be superpositions of the form @xmath45 where the complex coefficients @xmath46 are to be determined from the condition that the states  ( [ coll1 ] ) be energy eigenstates of a suitable effective hamiltonian .",
    "these states are formally very similar to frenkel excitons @xcite , e.g. in molecular crystals .",
    "we are interested in the spontaneous radiative decay of a simply - excited correlated atomic state which is coupled to a continuum of one - photon states . the dominant contribution to this decay will come from a quasi - resonant single - photon transition so that two - photon- or higher - photon - number processes can be expected to play a negligible role , and",
    "hence it will be admissible to truncate the possible quantum states of the radiation field to one - photon states @xmath47 , and the vacuum @xmath40 .",
    "the electric - dipole - admissible single - photon transitions of our correlated atomic sample are    [ proc1 ] @xmath48    where , in the second line  ( [ proc1b ] ) , the sample emits a photon and makes a transition to a doubly - excited state @xmath49 .",
    "such processes are inherently non - resonant and will be neglected , a step which is usually called the _ rotating - wave approximation _ @xcite .",
    "we therefore take into account only transitions of the sample to the common ground state , accompanied by emission of a single photon ( [ proc1a ] ) .",
    "thus , the state space of our joint system atoms+radiation is spanned by the simply - excited radiationless states @xmath42 , and the continuum of one - photon states @xmath50 , both of which are eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "we now split the state space into a radiationless subspace , spanned by the simply - excited states @xmath42 , and the subspace of one - photon states @xmath51 ; the associated projectors are @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by construction ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 commute with @xmath23 .",
    "we now formulate the decay of a given simply - excited correlated state @xmath56 into the continuum of one - photon states : let @xmath57 be the evolution operator associated with the hamiltonian  ( [ su2 ] ) in the schrdinger picture , and let us assume that , at time @xmath58 , the atomic sample is in a correlated state , the radiation field is in the vacuum state @xmath40 , and no correlations between atoms and radiation are present , so that the state vector of the total system is @xmath59 .",
    "we wish to compute the probability that the radiation at time @xmath60 is still trapped in the system ; in other words , the probability that the system at time @xmath61 can be found within the radiationless @xmath54-space , @xmath62 the evolution operator @xmath57 can be expressed as a fourier transform over the green operator , so that , for @xmath60 , @xmath63 where we have used eq .  ( [ coll1 ] ) .",

    "the energy - dependent non - hermitean hamiltonian in the @xmath54-channel @xmath68 has left and right eigenvectors    [ chde11 ] @xmath69 which satisfy a generalized orthonormality relation @xcite @xmath70 and which are @xmath54-space - complete in the sense that @xmath71    the projector property , @xmath72 , immediately follows from ( [ chde11c ] ) and ( [ chde11d ] ) .    with the help of relations ( [ chde11 ] ) we can write the non - hermitean channel hamiltonian in the form @xmath73 which is obviously a generalization of the diagonal form of hermitean hamiltonians in the associated basis of energy eigenvectors .",
    "the @xmath54-space green operator can be expressed similarly , @xmath74 if this is inserted into ( [ amp3 ] ) for @xmath75 we obtain an expression for the transition amplitude which is still exact .",
    "however , in the neighbourhood of the unperturbed initial energy @xmath76 ,    [ unpin1 ] @xmath77    the variation of @xmath78 near @xmath75 due to the quasi - resonant behaviour of the denominator can be expected to be much stronger than the variation due to the functional dependence @xmath79 ; for this reason , @xmath80 can be replaced by its value @xmath81 at the dominant energy of the process under consideration . then ( [ chde12 ] ) becomes @xmath82 we need the matrix representation of this operator in the uncorrelated basis @xmath42 .",

    "the eigenvalues are generally complex , all imaginary parts being _ negative _ , @xmath86 since all states in the @xmath54-space have a finite lifetime and therefore must eventually decay ; this carries over into the condition  ( [ proc35 ] ) .",

    "the only exception of course is the self - correlation of atom @xmath28 , as expressed by the fact that the diagonal elements @xmath119 are equal to one at each distance .",
    "thus , the decay matrix @xmath107 tends to @xmath120 as @xmath121 , implying that the spontaneous emission rate for any simply - excited collective state @xmath56 tends to the single - atom rate @xmath97 , as expected .",
    "now we study the opposite limit : the decay matrix @xmath107 has a well - defined limit for vanishing interatomic distance , since @xmath122 and as a consequence , @xmath123 in this limit .",

    "on the other hand , the function @xmath114 diverges in the limit @xmath128 .",

    "as mentioned above , in the limit @xmath141 we have @xmath142 ; eq . ( [ proc28 ] ) then implies that @xmath143    we now turn to discuss the behaviour of the diagonal elements @xmath144 : these quantities are infinite , since @xmath145 .",
    "this divergence remains even if only a single atom is considered , and has to do with the inevitable coupling of the atom to the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom of the radiation field . from ( [ proc26 ]    [ proc28 ] )",
    "we learn that part of the divergence comes from the coulomb dipole self - energy of atom @xmath28 .",
    "the other contribution to the self - energy is associated with emission and reabsorption of virtual photons of the dipole which is an ongoing process even if only one atom is embedded in the vacuum .",
    "it emerges explicitly as a radiative dipole self - energy ( an infinite @xmath16-number term ) , when the gppert - mayer transformation is performed on the standard hamiltonian .",
    "these processes are usually summarized by saying that the energy levels , together with the states , undergo _ radiative corrections_.    as a consequence , the unperturbed states are not really the true physical states ; rather , they are abstract constructions whose coupling to the continuum of radiation modes shifts their unperturbed energy by an infinite , but _ unobservable _ amount , an effect which is well - known in quantum field theory @xcite .",

    "we also see that the slope is a function of the radius @xmath173 .",
    "we note that the four curves in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] imply the existence of a common _ critical interatomic distance _ : for large @xmath0 , the next - neighbour distance @xmath377 between two atoms on the perimeter of the circle is roughly equal to @xmath378 ; if we compute this distance for the pairs of values @xmath379 as found above we obtain @xmath380 , respectively .",
    "we see that a critical distance of @xmath381 presents itself : if , for fixed radius @xmath173 , the number of atoms in the configuration is increased , the next - neighbour distance @xmath377 decreases ; as soon as @xmath382 is reached , the order of magnitude by which spontaneous emission from the maximally subradiant state is suppressed becomes approximately proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "based upon this reasoning we see that , for a given radius @xmath173 , the critical number @xmath383 of atoms in configuration  ( b ) is given by @xmath384 . then , we infer from fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] that , approximately , @xmath385 where @xmath386 determines the slopes of the curves in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] ; this function decreases monotonically with @xmath173 .",
    "we must have the limit @xmath387 , because for large radii all correlations between atoms must cease to exist , and hence @xmath388 in this limit .",
    "let @xmath389 denote the lifetime of the excited level in a single two - level atom ; then formula ( [ explaw1 ] ) tells us that the lifetime @xmath390 of a maximally subradiant state pertaining to @xmath364 increases exponentially with the number of atoms , @xmath391",
    "in this last section we study a configuration of @xmath0 identical two - level systems which are arranged in a linear - chain configuration .",
    "as before we focus attention on simply - excited states only .",
    "this system no longer has a symmetry group , so that we have to resort to numerical methods to compute energy eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "it turns out that the eigenvectors , i.e. , the coefficients of the correlated states @xmath56 in the uncorrelated basis @xmath42 , are qualitatively very similar to those seen in fig .  [ figure3 ] for the circular configurations , except for some possible modifications at the boundaries of the configuration .",
    "the energy eigenvalues exhibit a different behaviour compared to the circular system , though .",
    "the most notable difference is the occurrence of a region @xmath392 $ ] , @xmath393 , in which spontaneous decay can be strongly suppressed for the state which , for the given distance @xmath189 , has the minimal decay rate @xmath364 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [ figure9 ] .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath394 , the value of @xmath395 approaches @xmath7 ; and , as soon as @xmath396 is approached and exceeded , the minimal decay rate exhibits a jump - like behaviour .",
    "this indicates that , even though spontaneous decay is suppressed for @xmath397 , this suppression will become increasingly unstable , and susceptible to environmental perturbations , as soon as we approach the critical value @xmath7 . in the region below this critical distance , spontaneous decay",
    "may be suppressed by several orders of magnitude ; for example , for the three values of @xmath398 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] , we have at the distance @xmath399 minimal decay rates of @xmath400 , respectively .     ranging between @xmath8 and @xmath401 , and @xmath402 atoms in the chain , respectively . for @xmath403 there is substantial suppression of spontaneous decay even for relatively small numbers @xmath0 of atoms .",
    "[ figure9 ] ]     ranging between @xmath8 and @xmath401 , and @xmath402 atoms in the chain , respectively . for @xmath403",
    "there is substantial suppression of spontaneous decay even for relatively small numbers @xmath0 of atoms .",
    "[ figure9 ] ]    however , the photon - trapping properties of the linear chain are not nearly as pronounced as those of the circular configurations . in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] we plot the same quantities as in fig .  [ figure8 ] but for the linear chain with a prescribed length , fixed at values of @xmath404 wavelengths .",
    "we see that a linear regime exists here as well , but the suppression of spontaneous decay is visibly smaller than in the circular configuration , as @xmath405 does not exceed a value of @xmath406 in the linear chain , while it reaches close to @xmath407 in the circle .",
    "to further exemplify this point , let us prescribe a number of , say , @xmath408 atoms , and demand a degree of suppression of spontaneous decay of , say , @xmath409 .",
    "we then ask : how small must the next - neighbour distance between atoms in the circle on the one hand , and the linear - chain configuration on the other hand , be in order to achieve the prescribed suppression of radiative decay ?",
    "a short computation shows that for the circle we need a next - neighbour distance @xmath410 ; while in the linear - chain configuration , @xmath411 is required . in other words , it is much harder to achieve the same degree of photon trapping in the linear chain , and indeed , for the values of parameters as given above , the circular configuration performs better than the linear chain by a factor @xmath412 ! thus ,",
    "if our objective is photon trapping , the circular configurations definitely would be our first choice .",
    "we develop the theory of simply - excited correlated states , their level shifts and decay rates , for planar configurations of identical two - level systems with parallel dipole moments , and apply the results to circular and linear configurations of atoms . for the circular systems , the atomic state space can be decomposed into carrier spaces pertaining to the various irreducible representations of the symmetry group @xmath10 of the system . accordingly",
    ", the channel hamiltonian on the radiationless subspace can be diagonalized on each carrier space separately , making an analytic computation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues feasable .",
    "each eigenvector can be uniquely labeled by the index @xmath5 of this representation . for quantum numbers",
    "@xmath413 the circular configuration is insensitive to the presence or absence of a central atom , so that the wavefunction of the associated quasi - particle describing the collective excitation of the sample occupies the central atom only in a @xmath6 state . it is explained how this feature is analogous to the behaviour of hydrogen - like @xmath4 states in a central potential .",
    "the presence of a central atom in the circular configurations causes level splitting and -crossing of the @xmath6 state , in which case damped quantum beats between two `` extreme '' @xmath6 configurations occur . for strong",
    "damping , the population transfer between the two extreme configurations is effectively aperiodic .",
    "finally , a critical number of atoms , corresponding to a next - neighbour distance of @xmath7 on the circle , exists , beyond which the lifetime of the maximally subradiant state increases exponentially with the number of atoms in the circle .",
    "the significance of this critical distance is exemplified by the jump - like behaviour of the minimal decay rate in linear - chain configurations of atoms with next - neighbour distance close to @xmath7 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the photon - trapping capability of the circular system is pronouncedly better than that of the linear - chain configurations .",
    "here we prove a technical result which is used in the main part of the paper :    let @xmath414 denote the distance between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath28 ( i.e. , outer atoms only ) .",
    "let @xmath415 be any function of this distance , @xmath416 .",
    "let @xmath5 be an integer .",
    "then @xmath417 _ proof : _    the sum @xmath151 on the left - hand side of ( [ append1 ] ) can be written as @xmath418 the sines are equal to @xmath419 while the distances satisfy the equations @xmath420 if this is inserted into ( [ append2 ] ) we obtain an expression which is the negative of ( [ append1 ] ) , and as a consequence , @xmath151 must be zero ."
