    "solitons , which were originally a concept arising in the study of integrable systems @xcite , have rapidly become a key paradigm in perturbed , non - integrable systems describing very many physical applications @xcite .",
    "a very succesful picture of soliton dynamics under different perturbations has resulted from the use of collective coordinate ( cc ) techniques @xcite : in many instances , solitons behave basically like point - like particles , and therefore their time evolution can be predicted by equations of motion which are ordinary differential equations .",
    "nevertheless , along the last decade it has been progressively realized that internal degrees of freedom of the solitons play a crucial role in a number of problems : they govern resonant soliton ( or solitary wave ) collisions @xcite , give rise to nontrivial soliton - impurity interactions @xcite , and can be excited both by ac forces @xcite and by thermal noise @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very important to assess whether or not physically relevant solitons possess internal modes .    in this rapid communication",
    "we study solitons of the sine - gordon ( sg ) equation , which arises in a diverse range of areas of physics , covering from crystal dislocation theory to josephson junctions @xcite . in spite of the fact that linear stability analysis leads to only one eigenvalue in the discrete spectrum , corresponding to a zero frequency goldstone mode @xcite , boesch and willis",
    "@xcite claimed that they found an internal `` quasimode '' above but close to the lower phonon band edge .",
    "they described this `` quasimode '' as a long - lived oscillation of the width of the sg kink .",
    "the possibility of such a mode had been suggested earlier by rice @xcite , by means of a variational approach that reproduced with great accuracy the internal mode frequency of the @xmath0 model @xcite and predicted the existence of a similar mode for the sg problem . to our knowledge ,",
    "@xcite is the only paper reporting the observation of this mode , although hints of its existence are scattered all over the soliton literature @xcite . a few years later , it was theoretically found @xcite , within the rice approach , that the internal mode of the sg and the @xmath0 kinks could be excited by a constant external force or by an initial distortion ; however , no numerical evidence was presented to confirm these results .",
    "therefore , we decided to revisit the issue of the existence of the internal mode of the sg equation in order to give a definitive answer to it .",
    "our approach , based in part on our earlier findings @xcite , overcomes the difficulty that the internal `` quasimode '' would lie within the phonon band by allowing us to look at driving frequencies well in the gap . as we will show below",
    ", this permits us to establish clearly that this putative internal mode does not exist .",
    "furthermore , we do observe the excitation of a discreteness induced internal mode @xcite , whose frequency is in excellent agreement with recent predictions by kevrekidis and jones @xcite .",
    "we substantiate these claims by briefly recalling our main analytical results in sec .",
    "[ colco ] , collecting our numerical results in sec .",
    "[ numso ] , and discussing our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "we begin by considering the perturbed sg equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the amplitude , frequency , and phase of the external periodic force . in @xcite",
    "we analyzed analytically and numerically the above problem in the more general context of nonlinear ( possibly damped ) klein - gordon systems , which includes eq .",
    "( [ ecua1 ] ) as well as the @xmath0 model .",
    "particularizing our results , obtained by means of the generalized travelling wave _ ansatz _ @xcite combined with the rice _ ansatz _",
    "@xcite , we find that the momentum @xmath5 and the width of the kink @xmath6 ( of a general nonlinear klein - gordon equation ; specific constants for the sg case will be given below ) obey the equations @xmath7 where x(t ) is the kink position . for sg , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the equation for the momentum is linear and can be solved exactly , yielding @xmath12 +   \\frac{q\\,\\epsilon}{\\delta } \\ , \\cos(\\delta t + \\delta_{0 } )    \\label{ecua4}\\ ] ] we thus see that the term @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ ecua24 ] ) involves two frequencies , @xmath3 and @xmath14 . as shown in @xcite , for the @xmath0 kink this leads to dramatic resonance effects when the ac driving frequency @xmath3 is half the frequency @xmath15 of the internal mode . without resonant excitation of kink modes ,",
    "the kink oscillates around its initial position as a pure point - like particle , as shown analytically and numerically in @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite for the above parameters , in case an internal mode is excited as in the @xmath0 system , the system energy grows and eventually leads to chaotic motion of the kink .",
    "in addition , the resonance at @xmath16 turns out to be much stronger than that at @xmath15 , which makes it a convenient way to probe those modes : in case the sg kink would possess such a degree of freedom , we should observe similar phenomena . in @xcite , the frequency of the numerically observed `` quasimode '' was @xmath17 in our units , whereas rice s theoretical analysis leads to @xcite @xmath18 . in both cases ,",
    "the corresponding half frequencies lie well within the gap ; we can thus force the system at the predicted resonances without exciting much radiation which could mask any internal mode effects .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our numerical search for internal modes or `` quasimodes '' of the sg equation .",
    "we have computed the numerical solution of the perturbed sg equation ( [ ecua1 ] ) by using the strauss - vzquez scheme @xcite , the total length of the system being @xmath19 , the steps being @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( or other values when indicated ) .",
    "free boundary conditions were also used , and the final time in the simulations was @xmath22 , enough to detect any possible resonance @xcite .      first , we have perturbed our system with an ac force of amplitude @xmath23 and phase @xmath24 .",
    "we have used a sg kink at rest as initial condition .",
    "we have computed the energy ( as defined in @xcite ) during the evolution , and then the mean value of the energy in the time interval @xmath25 , studying a range of values of @xmath3 around half of the possible internal mode frequencies .",
    "figure [ f8 ] collects our results for the mean energy as a function of the frequency .",
    "we clearly see that the mean energy rapidly increases for some values of @xmath3 which do not coincide with any of the proposed internal modes or `` quasimodes . ''",
    "the first ( leftmost ) maximum lies below half the frequency of the lower phonon band edge ; therefore , this one can not be associated with a phonon mode and we will discuss its origin in detail below . as for the other peaks , table [ tab2.1 ]",
    "shows that we have been able to identify them with half of the values of the first frequencies of the phonon band , @xmath26 , which are given by @xmath27^{2}},$ $ n=1,2,3,\\ldots , n = l/\\delta x.    \\label{fon}\\ ] ] a comparison of the third and fourth columns of table [ tab2.1 ] , where we list the half values of the frequencies corresponding to the first @xmath28 radiational modes and the numerical peak frequencies @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , counting from the second maximum from the left , allows to verify that these values are nearly identical in all cases ( see also the relative differences @xmath30 in table [ tab2.1 ] ) .",
    "we stress that identification of radiation modes as the origin of these resonances makes perfect physical sense : indeed , an extended cc approach including radiation modes leads to the conclusion that the radiation modes should also be excited parametrically by ac drivings . in view of all this , the main conclusion we can draw from fig .  [ f8 ] is the absence of any resonance due to the internal quasi - mode in the phonon band reported by boesch and willis @xcite , which , in view of the frequency they reported , would lead to an extra peak located between the two rightmost ones in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] . in this regard ,",
    "it is important to note that the accuracy of our simulations in detecting every radiation mode rules out the possibility that we have missed this quasi - mode ( at either @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) .",
    "interestingly , we do observe an internal mode : let us recall that the first maximum of the energy occurs at @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 is below the lower phonon frequency @xmath35 as we mentioned above .",
    "the reason for this peak is a novel internal mode of the sg kink , that appears as a bifurcation from the lowest phonon of the continuum equation , of frequency @xmath35 , due to the effect of discreteness @xcite .",
    "as has been recently shown @xcite , the frequency of this new internal mode is @xmath36 ( the @xmath37 dependence was already observed in @xcite ) . in our simulations , @xmath20 , hence @xmath38 , approximately equal to @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the first peak in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] corresponds to the parametric resonance at half the value of the discreteness induced internal mode , very much like the resonance with the @xmath0 kink internal mode reported earlier @xcite .      in view of our negative result about the internal quasi - mode of the sg kink , we carried out more numerical simulations specifically designed to find it .",
    "following @xcite , we chose initial conditions given by @xmath40\\right)}},\\\\ \\\\ { \\displaystyle {   \\phi_t(x,0)=2\\,\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\left [ -\\frac{u(0)}{l(0)}-\\frac{x - x(0)}{l^2(0 ) } \\dot{l}(0)\\right]}}{\\displaystyle\\mbox{cosh}\\left[\\frac{x - x(0)}{l(0)}\\right ] } } } ,   \\end{array } \\label{val - ini - sg}\\ ] ] which correspond to a deformed kink if @xmath41 or @xmath42 . by starting their simulations with such initial conditions , boesch and willis claimed that they were able to excite the internal quasi - mode , and hence we hope that , if it is indeed present , we should find it .    at this point",
    ", we have to recall the work of majernkov , gaididei and braun @xcite , who , as mentioned in the introduction , theoretically considered the problem of a deformed kink given by the expressions above driven by a external constant force . when applied to this problem , our cc approach yields the same two ordinary differential equations as in @xcite for @xmath43 and @xmath6 , [ eqs .",
    "( [ ecua23])-([ecua24 ] ) without the sine term , i.e. , with only a constant force @xmath2 ] .",
    "we have solved these equations exactly for arbitrary initial conditions @xcite in terms of the whittaker functions , concluding that the kink width oscillates only if @xmath45 ( the natural width of the undistorted kink , @xmath46 ) or @xmath47 in ( [ val - ini - sg ] ) , whereas external force and dissipation ( if present ) only damp out those oscillations .",
    "hence , kink width oscillations should be easiest to detect without force and damping and , consequently , here we consider only free propagation of an initially distorted kink ( a general analysis of the constant force problem will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) . as a check of the validity of this procedure to probe internal modes",
    ", we have numerically verified that the @xmath0 kink indeed behaves in this fashion due to the excitation of the internal mode , exhibiting oscillations in the kink width very close to those predicted by the cc approach .",
    "we then turned to the sg case , and we found that the oscillations are not correctly described by the cc equations . in fig .",
    "[ f3.8 ] we can see the evolution of the kink width computed from numerical simulation of the sg system , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 is not a simple oscillatory function as in the @xmath0 case , and fourier analysis yields the following frequencies : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . as before",
    ", all these frequencies are very close to the discreteness induced internal mode and the first few radiational modes , with no evidence supporting the existence of the internal quasi - mode above the phonon band edge .",
    "the first conclusion of this work is that the existence of the proposed internal quasi - mode of the sg kink above the phonon band edge @xcite is very unlikely .",
    "we have found neither resonances nor long - lived kink width oscillations arising from such a mode when the kink is subject to ac driving or to initial deformations , respectively .",
    "we are confident that we have carefully explored all the range of relevant frequencies , as we have accurately detected all possible resonances within that range .",
    "in addition , the comparison with the phenomenology observed for the @xmath0 kink , that possesses a true internal mode , shows that if the sg kink would have such an internal mode , we would have detected its influence through numerical simulations as for the @xmath0 equation @xcite .",
    "in fact , now that we have seen that radiation modes are parametrically excited by their corresponding half - frequency drivings , we believe we can suggest an explanation for the results of boesch and willis .",
    "notice that they used eq .",
    "( [ fon ] ) to calculate the lower phonon frequency , obtaining that @xmath59 , whereas the internal `` quasimode '' frequency that they found in the numerical simulations was @xmath60 .",
    "as those two values were largely different , they concluded that the quasi - mode was well above the lowest phonon frequency and different from it .",
    "however , as we have discussed in the previous sections , they used initial conditions in which the initial kink velocity was not zero ; in this case , it can be easily shown that the corresponding frequencies of the phonons are given by @xmath61 if we now insert the parameters used in @xcite to perform a numerical experiment similar to the one discussed here , we find @xmath62 , i.e. , the resonance observed by boesch and willis took place in fact with the lowest frequency phonon _ in the presence of a moving kink _ and not with any internal quasi - mode .",
    "the second conclusion of the present paper relates to the recently proposed internal modes induced by perturbations , in our case by discreteness @xcite . by the two different types of numerical simulations used in our research , we have detected the internal mode bifurcating from the edge of the phonon band ( of the continuum problem ) .",
    "the frequency of that mode agrees qualitatively very well with the one predicted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our research fully confirms the results of those papers and , in addition , shows that these perturbation induced internal modes behave very much like intrinsic ones .",
    "our result , along with the finding of similar internal modes in other nonintegrable sg systems @xcite , strongly supports the generality of the phenomenon predicted in @xcite .",
    "finally , the fact that we are able to detect this novel mode reinforces our previous conclusion of the non - existence of the internal quasi - mode , as indeed the sg kink responds to the ac driving or to deformations as it should if it had an internal mode , but for the discreteness induced one only .",
    "we thus believe that the present work definitely rules out the possibility of internal modes or `` quasimodes '' of sg kinks close to and above the lower phonon band edge .",
