    "radio polarization maps of the milky way often exhibit a network of apparently randomly oriented , narrow ( less than the beam width ) , elongated regions where polarized intensity vanishes or is greatly reduced .",
    "these structures , now known as ` canals ' , have been reported by a number of authors and belong to the class of structures visible in polarized emission that do not have counterparts in the total radio intensity ( duncan et al .",
    "1997 ; gray et al.1998 , 1999 ; uyaniker et al .",
    "1999a ; haverkorn , katgert & de bruyn 2000 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2001 ) . in fig .",
    "[ m31 ] we show an example of canals in the field of the nearby galaxy m31 . some of the canals are nearly closed , forming cells , or at least have pronounced curvature , and within the cells the polarization angle often hardly varies .",
    "other canals are more or less straight , and often occur in nearly parallel pairs .",
    "the appearance of the canals depends on the wavelength of observation ( haverkorn et al .",
    "an example of similar features was discussed by scheuer , hannay & hargrave @xcite .",
    "the canals were first identified as distinct features in polarization maps by duncan et al .",
    "@xcite and uyaniker et al .",
    "the latter authors propose that the canals may be caused by filaments in thermal plasma and/or suitable magnetic structures .",
    "as shown by haverkorn et al.@xcite , the polarization angle of the radio emission flips by about @xmath0 across a canal , which prompted these authors to suggest that the canals arise from beam depolarization due to a discontinuous distribution of the foreground faraday rotation measure rm caused by abrupt changes in the magnetic field direction .",
    "gaensler at al .",
    "@xcite support the idea of beam depolarization , but note that the foreground rm does not exhibit abrupt changes across the canals , and therefore attribute these structures to a highly nonuniform magnetic field in the synchrotron source .",
    "it seems , however , highly implausible that the distribution of magnetic field should be discontinuous to that extent , and that either the variations of rm have just the right amplitude to rotate the polarization angle preferentially by @xmath0 or the magnetic field direction changes preferentially by right angles .",
    "furthermore , neither of these interpretations can easily explain why the pattern of canals changes with wavelength .",
    "the canals apparent in the field of m31 ( see fig .  [ m31 ] ) must originate in the milky way because their network extends far beyond the image of m31 .",
    "an eyeball estimate of the typical separation of the canals is about @xmath1 , corresponding to a linear scale of about 1pc at a distance of 1kpc .",
    "figure  [ m31]b confirms that the polarization angles flip by about @xmath0 across the canals .    uyaniker et al .",
    "@xcite mention the possibility that the canals may be due to faraday depolarization without giving any details .",
    "we attribute the canals to depolarization along the line of sight rather than across the beam .",
    "this was first proposed by beck @xcite who showed that the canals can arise from depolarization by differential faraday rotation , and so do not require any discontinuities or even strong gradients in the parameters of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this letter",
    "we substantiate this idea and argue that the canals represent level lines of rm where @xmath2 with @xmath3 the wavelength and @xmath4 .",
    "then we discuss how statistical properties of the ism can be determined from the angular separation of the canals .     that varies across the sky ( along @xmath5 ) ; the intrinsic polarization angle is uniform ( vertical double arrows on the left ) .",
    "emission generated on the @xmath5-axis cancels the emission generated in a layer where the former is rotated by @xmath6 , i.e. , where @xmath7 .",
    "regions whose emissions mutually cancel are indicated by perpendicularly hatched boxes .",
    "only the emission from unshaded regions reaches the observer .",
    "the arrows on the right show the observed polarization plane which has been faraday rotated in layers to the right of the visible ( unshaded ) region to give the polarization angle @xmath8 in the range indicated .",
    "note that layers to the right of the source act as a faraday screen , and so the rotation angle is @xmath9 .",
    "the canals occur where the polarized emission is fully cancelled ( regions labelled b ) .",
    "the emission observed at values of @xmath10 slightly smaller than @xmath11 ( regions a ) and slightly larger than @xmath11 ( regions c ) originate in different layers . the difference in @xmath10 between regions a and c is @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , emission from region a is rotated by @xmath6 before reaching the observer , whereas emission from region c is rotated only slightly .",
    "thus , the polarization angles observed on the two sides of a canal differ by @xmath6 . a canal that occurs when @xmath12 with @xmath13 is shown near the top , and with @xmath14 , near the bottom .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "differential faraday rotation is one of the simplest and best known depolarization mechanisms which arises where relativistic and thermal electrons fill the same region of magnetized medium , so that synchrotron emission and faraday rotation occur together .",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath15 then varies with the observable faraday rotation measure rm and @xmath3 as ( burn 1966 , sokoloff et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath16 and so vanishes when @xmath17 , where @xmath18 with @xmath19 the intrinsic degree of polarization this expression is applicable to a uniform slab and to a few more complicated configurations discussed by sokoloff et al .",
    "@xcite , and is sufficient for our purposes here .",
    "it is important to note that the angle of polarization suffers jumps by @xmath6 at the same values of rm where @xmath15 vanishes [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "2b in burn @xcite and sect .  3.1 in sokoloff",
    "et al.@xcite ] .",
    "the nature of depolarization by differential faraday rotation and the origin of the jumps are further illustrated in fig .  [ layers ] .",
    "if rm varies across the sky , polarized intensity will vanish at those positions @xmath20 in the sky plane where @xmath21 , i.e. , for a given wavelength , at the critical level lines of rm where @xmath22 .",
    "for example , @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the loci of vanishing polarization are geometric lines , i.e. , they are infinitely thin , hence always narrower than the beam , as are the canals ( gaensler et al .  2001 ; see fig .",
    "[ m31]a ) .",
    "the position of the level lines changes with wavelength , as does the network of canals .",
    "extended polarized emissions seen on different sides of a canal come from different regions along the line of sight ( see fig .",
    "[ layers ] ) .",
    "hence , the polarization angles differ by @xmath6 as rm crosses the critical level @xmath25 , i.e. , across the canal .",
    "faraday depolarization does not affect the total synchrotron emission , so canals are not visible in total intensity .",
    "we believe that these arguments are convincing enough to attribute the canals to depolarization by differential faraday rotation .",
    "as they are not directly related to any structures in the ism , we call them _ ` faraday ghosts ' .",
    "_    we now recall that in the turbulent interstellar medium rm is a random function of position .",
    "as discussed by wardle & kronberg @xcite and naghizadeh - khouei & clarke @xcite , the probability distribution function of the observed polarization angle is well approximated by a gaussian as long as the stokes parameters are gaussian random variables and the signal - to - noise ratio is large enough . since the faraday rotation measure between two wavelengths is proportional to the difference of the polarization angles , rm is also a gaussian random function . according to our estimates",
    ", the deviations from the gaussian distribution in rm do not exceed a few percent for signal - to - noise ratios exceeding unity . in fig .",
    "[ m31]a the signal - to - noise ratio is larger than 3 ( beck et al .",
    "it is useful to distinguish two types of level lines of a random distribution of rm , and so two types of canals .",
    "level lines of the first type occur at a level close to the mean value of rm , denoted here @xmath26 , whereas the others occur near high , rare peaks of @xmath27 .",
    "the two types have distinct statistical properties .",

    "[ m31 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding canals will form cells where they surround local extrema of @xmath28 or will have low curvature , like a contour of constant height along a valley or a mountain ridge .",

    "[ m31 ] where the canals are very prominent and where we can obtain reliable estimates of @xmath26 and @xmath69 .",
    "the mean value of rm in the direction of m31 , obtained from the rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources in that part of the sky , is @xmath70 ( beck 1982 ; han , beck & berkhuijsen 1998 ) .",

    "the observable rm can be further reduced by depolarization . then rm that enters eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) is just a part of @xmath75 .",
    "an estimate of the depth through the milky way over which the observed polarized emission is produced and the corresponding effective value of @xmath26 can be obtained as follows .",
    "the dominant mechanism of depolarization , apart from differential faraday rotation , is internal faraday dispersion due to turbulence in the ism .",

    "( 34 ) of sokoloff et al.@xcite , we conclude that this mechanism reduces the degree of polarization at @xmath79 by about 16% .",
    "therefore , the effective geometric depth visible at this wavelength is about 0.84 of the path length through the magneto - ionic layer of the milky way in that direction .",
    "( thus , the region visible in polarized emission at @xmath80 cm in the direction of m31 is about 2kpc deep , assuming that the scale height of the magneto - ionic layer is 0.8kpc . )",

    "as shown above , the mean separation of canals in fig .  [ m31 ] is related to the taylor microscale , a measure of the curvature of the autocorrelation function of rm at small separations . in the present context",
    ", the taylor microscale can be tentatively identified , e.g. , with the thickness of magnetic ropes , or with the size of blobs or the thickness of filaments in the thermal electron distribution .",
    "we emphasize that the canals are _ not _ directly related to any ropes or filaments in the magneto - ionic medium .",
    "however , the statistical properties of the canals are sensitive to small - scale structures in the medium .",
    "ropy structures of magnetic fields arise naturally from fluctuation dynamo action ( zeldovich , ruzmaikin & sokoloff 1990 ; subramanian 1999 ) , and filamentary structures in the gas components are abundant in the ism ( e.g. , koo , heiles & reach 1992 ) .",
    "the resulting estimate of the the rope thickness , @xmath112 , corresponds to about 0.6pc at a distance of 1kpc .",
    "faraday rotation from such structures would be difficult to observe directly as they would need to have @xmath113 in order to produce @xmath114 .    when combined with faraday dispersion , depolarization by differential faraday rotation",
    "leads to a smooth dependence of @xmath15 on rm , where @xmath15 does not entirely vanish at the local minima ( sokoloff et al .",
    "this leads to canals where polarized intensity does not vanish but is only strongly reduced ; still , they preserve , in an approximate manner , the properties discussed above .",
    "canals have been observed in many directions in the milky way .",
    "in particular , duncan et al .",
    "@xcite have detected them at the wavelength @xmath115 cm in the southern galactic plane .",
    "as follows from eq .",
    "( [ rm0 ] ) , the value of @xmath25 at that wavelength is at least @xmath116 , and so the canals are observed because the mean faraday rotation measure is suitably high in that direction .",
    "a signature of the mechanism discussed here is the displacement of the canals when the wavelength varies .",
    "canals produced by discontinuities in magnetic field or faraday rotation measure would not shift with wavelength , whereas those produced by differential faraday rotation must shift as described in sect .",
    "however , canal displacements consistent with our model may be too small to be detected in the data available .",
    "another interesting type of ghosts in polarized emission is discussed by gaensler et al .",
    "these ghosts arise in interferometer observations because an extended , polarized ( and unpolarized ) background , uniform in intensity ( to which an interferometer is insensitive ) , is missing .",
    "however , small - scale structures in polarization angle ( i.e. , in the stokes parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) are not missed and cause variations in the observed polarized intensity but not in the total synchrotron intensity .",
    "this can result in blobs and filaments of enhanced or reduced polarized intensity .",
    "these effects may lead to extreme fractional polarization , possibly even above 0.75 .",
    "wieringa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) describe polarized filaments invisible in total intensity , observed with the westerbork interferometer .",
    "we note that ghosts of this type also occur in single - dish observations ( uyaniker et al .",
    "except for some fields of uyaniker et al .",
    "@xcite , such measurements are rarely absolutely calibrated in both total and polarized intensities .",
    "therefore , a baselevel is subtracted to obtain a zero level for the emission .",
    "such ghosts may be called _",
    "` base - level ghosts ' . _",
    "furthermore , missing spacings and baselevel corrections have the same effect as a missing ( i.e. , depolarized ) quasi - uniform , magneto - ionic layer .",
    "they lead to a shift in the positions of the canals and possibly to their ( dis)appearance , without changing their statistical nature . as base - level ghosts",
    "can be produced at one s will in any data by adjusting the zero level , this opens new possibilities to study the magneto - ionic medium using the ghosts .    in summary ,",
    "both faraday ghosts ( canals ) and base - level ghosts ( blobs , depressions , filaments ) are features in the observed polarized emission without a counterpart in the total emission . as they do not arise from any real structures in the ism , we call them ` ghosts ' .",
    "the canals are due to depolarization by differential faraday rotation in the turbulent magneto - ionic medium .",
