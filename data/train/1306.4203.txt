    "<S> * ( 2.11 ) , ( 2.12 ) ) , the resolvent @xmath64 is decomposed into two pieces , one of which corresponds to resonances in a large disk and the other one to the rest of the resonances ; using an auxiliary determinant  ( * ? ? ? * ( 2.7 ) ) , it is shown that it is enough to study mapping properties of large iterates of @xmath64 , which implies that resonances outside the disk can be ignored in a certain asymptotic regime . in our work , however , we show directly that @xmath64 lies in a class where one can take the flat trace . in terms of the expression  </S>",
    "<S> , this requires uniform control of the wavefront set of @xmath65 as @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> such a statement does not follow from the analysis for bounded times and this is where the matters are considerably simplified by using radial source / sink estimates originating in scattering theory .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) in this paper we only provide analysis at bounded frequencies , but do not discuss the behavior of @xmath67 as @xmath68 goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> however , a high frequency analysis of the zeta function is possible using the methods of semiclassical analysis , which recover the structure of @xmath64 modulo @xmath69 , rather than just compact , errors . </S>",
    "<S> an example is provided by the bounds on the number of pollicott  </S>",
    "<S> ruelle resonances in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since this paper was first posted related results have appeared . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the authors showed that pollicott  </S>",
    "<S> ruelle resonances are the limits of eigenvalues of @xmath70 , as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is any laplace  </S>",

    "<S> in addition , for contact anosov flows the spectral gap is uniform with respect to @xmath73 . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> jin  </S>",
    "<S> zworski proved that for any anosov flow there exists a strip with infinitely many resonances and a counting function which can not be sublinear . </S>",
    "<S> for weakly mixing flows the estimate for the size of that strip in terms of topological pressure was provided by naud in the appendix to @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> meromorphic continuation ( of @xmath74 and of zeta fucntions ) for flows on non - compact manifolds ( or manifolds with boundary ) with compact hyperbolic trapped sets was recently established by dyatlov  guillarmou @xcite . that required a development of new microlocal methods as the escape on the cotangent bundle can occur both at fiber infinity ( as in this paper ) _ and _ at the manifold infinity . </S>",
    "<S> a surprising application was given by guillamou @xcite who established deformation lens rigidity for a class of manifolds including manifolds with negative curvature and strictly convex boundary . </S>",

    "<S> see for instance @xcite . at the radial points we use the more recent propagation results of melrose @xcite and vasy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the a  priori regularity needed there is provided by the properties of the spaces @xmath77 . finally , in  [ t1 ] we give our proof of the main theorem which is a straightforward application of the results in  [ micro ] and the more standard results recalled in  </S>",

    "<S> we use the following notation : @xmath78 means that @xmath79 where the norm ( or any seminorm ) is in the space @xmath80 , and the constant @xmath81 depends on @xmath82 . </S>",
