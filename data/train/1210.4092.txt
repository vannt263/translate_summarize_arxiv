    "a very different research field is the one based on the idea of using geometry to study some properties of thermodynamic systems @xcite-@xcite . in particular , it consists in defining a metric in a two dimensional parameter space y calculate the corresponding scalar curvature as a measure of the correlations strength of the system @xcite-@xcite , with applications to classical and quantum gases @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , magnetic systems @xcite-@xcite , non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite-@xcite , anyon gas @xcite-@xcite , fractional statistics @xcite , deformed boson and fermion systems @xcite and systems with fractal distribution functions @xcite . some of the basic results of these approaches include the relationships between the metric with the correlations of the stochastic variables , and the scalar curvature @xmath6 with the stability of the system , and the facts that the scalar curvature @xmath6 vanishes for the classical ideal gas , @xmath7 for a boson ( fermion ) ideal gas , and it is singular at a critical point . here",

    "we will consider the simplest quantum group , @xmath4 , invariant hamiltonian , and calculate the metric and the corresponding scalar curvature @xmath6 .",
    "this approach will allow us to obtain information about the stability of quantum group boson ( qgb ) and quantum group fermion ( qgf ) systems as a consequence of the interactions imposed by the requirement of quantum group invariance , and it will also give us a complete picture about the anyonic behavior of these systems in the whole range of values of the fugacity @xmath2 . in section [ qgbf ]",

    "although at this moment is still an open question the relevance that quantum groups may have outside the theory of the inverse scattering method and integrable models in the context of yang - baxter algebras , and whether the interactions induced by the requirement of quantum group invariance are realizable in quantum statistical mechanics , this work provides a theoretical framework to understand boson - fermion transmutation in two and three dimensions which could have implications in other areas of physics .",
