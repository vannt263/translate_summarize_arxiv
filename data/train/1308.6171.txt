    "in these supplementary notes , we describe effects of collisions of unidirectional charged vortex rings ( cvrs ) due to the small variations , @xmath110 , of their velocities around the mean value @xmath111 .",
    "any such collision of primary cvrs generally results in secondary cvrs of quite different size  hence depleting the number of the primary cvrs .",
    "we consider purely one - dimensional trajectories of cvrs , @xmath91 , between the injector at @xmath6 and collector at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we assume a uniform electric field @xmath112 , a negligible initial radius of cvrs , @xmath113 , and a constant logarithmic parameter @xmath114 ( where @xmath115  is the core radius ) . within the time of flight from the injector to collector , @xmath57 , the lengthening of the beam , caused by the range of velocities @xmath116 , does not exceed the duration of injection @xmath55s and is , hence , neglected .",

    "the radius grows linearly with @xmath5 , @xmath123 where the radius of cvrs at collector , @xmath9 , is @xmath124 the time of flight between @xmath6 and @xmath36 is @xmath125 i.e. the trajectory of primary cvrs is @xmath126 where the time of flight from injector to collector is @xmath127        the number density of primary rings in the beam @xmath90 , along the trajectory @xmath91 , evolves according to : @xmath131 where @xmath93 is the rate of losses due to ring - ring collisions . for small @xmath4 ,",
    "at which @xmath132 , the number of cvrs is conserved , and the solution is @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath134 .",
    "experimentally , the value of constant @xmath135 can be determined from the magnitude of the peak of the collector current due to primary cvrs , @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the radius and transparency of the collector grid , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we arrive at @xmath141 the density at collector is @xmath142 thus , in this regime of conserved primary cvrs , their density can be varied by changing either the intensity of injection ( as measured by @xmath96 ) or drive voltage @xmath56 .      for each cvr ,",
    "the probability of a collision with another cvr per unit time is @xmath143 , where @xmath144 ( as @xmath145 ) , and the cross - section is @xmath146 , where @xmath147 .",
    "naive geometric considerations suggest @xmath148 , although further research into this problem is necessary @xcite .",
    "if each collision effectively removes two primary cvrs from the coherent beam , the total number of removed cvrs per unit time and unit volume : @xmath149 after using eqs.[nablav]&[tau1 ] , and @xmath150 from the above expression , eq.[rateequation ] becomes : @xmath151 its asymptotic solution is @xmath152 at @xmath82 , @xmath153 the rhs is independent of both the injection intensity and @xmath56 . for @xmath154 and @xmath155@xmath12 m , it is equal to @xmath156@xmath105 , which is a factor of 8 greater than the experimental value of @xmath157@xmath105 .",
    "there might be several reasons for such a discrepancy .",
    "firstly , the cross - section for the effective removal of cvrs from the coherent beam of similar orientation and velocities might be several times greater than the geometric guess @xmath158 .",
    "secondly , in this model we restricted all cvrs to motion along the @xmath5-axis with only a spread of radii ; in reality they also have a small random spread of directions of motion caused by the conserved transverse component of the impulse of the initial cvrs  our estimates show that its contribution to the frequency of collisions is comparable with that calculated here .",
    "another process that should further limit the density of primary cvrs is the removal of all cvrs that bump into the secondary vortex rings formed upon any binary collision discussed above .",
    "large secondary cvrs appear with each primary collisions at a rate , per unit volume and time , @xmath159 as these larger rings are considerably slower than the primary ones , they block all the primary cvrs from behind within the effective cross - section @xmath102 , where @xmath160 , and the upper limit on its geometrical value is @xmath161 @xcite . the typical number of primary cvrs lost in such a capture ( the `` multiplication factor '' ) is @xmath162 .",
    "the rate of losses per unit volume and time is hence @xmath163 with @xmath164 , eq.[rateequation ] becomes @xmath165 its asymptotic solution is : @xmath166 for @xmath82 this gives @xmath167 independent of the injection intensity and @xmath56 . for @xmath100 , @xmath103 , @xmath155@xmath12 m , @xmath55s and @xmath46 cm",
    ", this produces @xmath168@xmath105 , which is only factor of 2 greater than the experimental value .",
    "furthermore , as we only considered the effect of longitudinal variations of the velocities @xmath169 of primary cvrs but disregarded the comparable effect from their transverse velocities , the agreement is quite good .      to conclude",
    ", the solutions , @xmath170 , found for either of the simple models of removal of primary vortex rings upon collisions , eq.[nr1 ] and eq.[nr2 ] , qualitatively agree with our experimental observations .",
    "moreover , the latter is actually in a reasonable quantitative agreement . thus multiple pile - ups explain the observed universal value of the product @xmath107 when cvrs collide frequently due to their large numbers and large radii .",
    "further experiments with varyable flight path @xmath171 , duration of injection @xmath54 and distribution of cvrs radii @xmath172 , as well as numerical simulations of the interaction between cvrs , will help improve our understanding of the microscopic processes that occur within beams of unidirectional vortex rings .",

    "<S> there were experimental attempts to visualize these processes in classical fluids @xcite ; however , they are often hard to interpret because of the inevitable decay , core instabilities and poor characterization of vortex rings in viscous fluids .    quantized vortex rings in superfluids have an advantage because they are slender and stable , and can hence be well - characterized quantitatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there were many theoretical investigations into reconnections of quantized vortex lines @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for acute angles between two antiparallel reconnecting vortex lines the generation of a cascade of small vortex rings was predicted @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome is reminiscent of that of the crow instability @xcite of antiparallel vortices observed in air . </S>",

    "<S> this implies the existence of the _ inverse cascade _ of energy from the small length scales ( of order ring radii ) into which the initial energy is injected  up to the size of the resulting tangle . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting mechanism of seeding the large - scale velocity fluctuations out of a seemingly random beam of vortex rings is suggested .    in our experiments , to create vortex rings of a required size and to detect their arrival , each was tagged by an excess electron trapped on the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> applying an electric field along the @xmath5-axis allowed small seed charged vortex rings ( cvrs ) , injected at @xmath6 , to grow to the desired radius @xmath7 , and also to trace the location of the reconnection process that resulted in small secondary charged vortex rings . </S>",

    "<S> to summarize , we obtained quantitative evidence for collisions and reconnections of pairs of unidirectional vortex rings of similar radii that result in the creation of vortex loops of unequal size , including many small ones . </S>",
    "<S> we observed discrete steps at the time dependence of the collector current , that correspond to the earliest arrivals of the first and second generations of secondary cvrs . </S>",
    "<S> as each collision can cause a removal of many primary vortex rings , increasing the density of injected cvrs results in a new state in which the density of primary vortex rings is maintained at the critically depleted level independent of their initial density . </S>",
    "<S> the larger loops produced in the collisions become the seeds of quasi - classical qt with large - scale flow structures , which appear out of a seemingly random beam of small quantized vortex rings . </S>",
