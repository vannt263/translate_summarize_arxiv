    "mixed ruthenates with perovskite based crystal structures have been receiving considerable attention of late @xcite , both because of their interesting magnetic properties and because of the recent discovery of superconductivity in the layered ruthenate , sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 @xcite . despite the rarity of 4d based magnetic materials ,",
    "srruo@xmath0 is a robustly ( curie temperature , @xmath4165 k ; magnetization , @xmath51.6 @xmath6/ru ) ferromagnetic metal occurring in a distorted cubic perovskite structure @xcite , and @xmath7 can be even further increased by doping with pb @xcite .",
    "however , magnetism is easily suppressed by doping with ca , although ca / sr states are far removed from the fermi level and accordingly may not be expected to influence the electronic properties of srruo@xmath0 very drastically .",
    "furthermore , sr@xmath1yruo@xmath8 which has essentially the same crystal structure as srruo@xmath9 but with every second ru substituted by y , is antiferromagnetic , with estimates of the saturation magnetization even higher than the parent compound ( @xmath10 although the critical temperature , @xmath11 is reduced to 26 k. the variety of magnetic and electronic properties observed in these superficially similar compounds already poses an interesting theoretical challenge ( cf .",
    ", for instance , non superconducting cuprates , which despite their large variety , always show strong antiferromagnetism in cu - o planes ) .",
    "besides , there are a number of interesting observations that deserve attention .",
    "these include the fact that srruo@xmath0 is the only known ferromagnetic metal among the 4@xmath12 oxides .",
    "as such interesting differences are expected from the much more abundant 3@xmath12 oxide magnets .",
    "for example , much stronger spin - orbit effects compared to the 3d systems may be anticipated , and these may manifest themselves in the magneto - crystalline and magneto - optical properties .",
    "in fact , srruo@xmath0 does show an abnormally high magneto - crystalline anisotropy for a pseudo cubic material @xcite to the extent that it is difficult to measure its saturation magnetization using standard measurements of hysteresis loops , and resulting in some confusion in the older experimental literature .",
    "more recently , klein and co - workers @xcite have measured strong magneto - optic properties in srruo@xmath0 epitaxial films .",
    "4@xmath12 ions generally have more extended @xmath12 orbitals than the corresponding 3@xmath12 ions , and as a result @xmath13 oxides tend to have greater overlap and hybridization between the transition metal and o 2@xmath14 orbitals . besides a tendency towards greater itinerancy , this can lead to more interplay between structural degrees of freedom and the magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "as mentioned , additional interest in these ruthenates comes from their apparent proximity to superconductivity , and possible new insights into the problem of high - temperature superconductivity that may emerge from their study .",
    "although the layered perovskite sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 has a modest @xmath15 of 1k ( there have been very recent , unconfirmed reports of signatures of superconductivity at up to 60k in the double perovskite sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 with cu doping @xcite ) , it was suggested that this material may be an unconventional superconductor .",
    "this is based largely on several similarities with the cuprates : sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 is iso - structural with the first discovered high-@xmath15 superconductor , shows highly two dimensional electronic properties , and of course is close to magnetic phases , particularly srruo@xmath0 , and sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 . however , the evidence for strong electron correlations in ruthenates is by far not yet as compelling as the body that has been accumulated for the cuprates and many other 3@xmath12 oxides , and the question of whether these ruthenates can be treated within the framework of conventional band theory , or require a strong - correlation based theory , remains open .",
    "several photoelectron spectroscopy experiments have been reported for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 , which because of its layered crystal structure is more amenable to such studies than nearly cubic srruo@xmath0 .",
    "yokoya et al .",
    "@xcite and lu et al .",
    "@xcite , using angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) , both report observation of fermi surface sections and extended van hove features somewhat like those in the local density electronic structure calculations , although the positioning of the van hove singularity relative to the fermi energy differs and the dispersion is generally somewhat weaker than in the calculations , probably due to correlations , but possibly because of strong electron - phonon and -magnon interactions .",
    "similarly , schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite observed the valence bands of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 using arpes , and found uppermost occupied bands with a width reduced by a factor of 2 compared with band structure calculations .",
    "unfortunately , arpes is highly sensitive to the quality of samples and particularly sample surfaces .",
    "interestingly , polycrystalline but otherwise apparently high quality sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 samples can be non - metallic @xcite .",
    "angle integrated photoemission is a more robust technique ; using it , yokoya et al .",
    "@xcite found good agreement between the experiment and density functional calculations , but observe a correlation satellite to the d - band ( using resonant photoemission ) .",
    "based on these measurements they estimated an effective hubbard @xmath16 of 1.5 ev , which is at least three times smaller than similar estimates for the cuprate superconductors , casting some doubt on suggestion that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 and related ruthenates are very strongly correlated .",
    "one of the most decisive arguments in favor of the importance of strong correlations in high-@xmath15 cuprates is the failure of conventional local - density - approximation band structure calculations to describe even qualitatively the antiferromagnetism in the undoped parent compounds .",
    "similarly , the key question for these ruthenates may be which approximation , strongly correlated or band structure based , is best suited to explaining the variety of magnetic properties .",
    "one of the main purposes of this work is to determine whether a ( similar to the cuprates ) failure of the conventional , mean - field type , band calculations , is present in these ruthenates .    within a strong - correlation scenario , the ferromagnetism in metallic srruo@xmath17 results from the double exchange mechanism , while antiferromagnetism in insulating sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 is due to superexchange via two ( unlike the 3d oxides and cu perovskites ) oxygen ions .",
    "this is appealing because in the mott - hubbard picture the main factor controlling the magnetic properties is carrier concentration , which is indeed different in those two materials : in ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 ruthenium is four - valent , that is , its @xmath12-band is populated by 4 electrons , while in sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 the nominal valency of ru is 5 , and the number of @xmath12 electrons is 3 . on the other hand , integer occupancy does not favor the double exchange scenario , and , besides , it is unclear how the mott - hubbard model provides a mechanism for suppressing magnetism in caruo@xmath18 finally , as we discuss in detail below , conventional band theory in all the cases we test does yield the correct magnetic ground state , in contrast to the cuprates and similar correlated 3@xmath19oxides .",
    "thus , contrary to some recently suggested superconductivity scenarios based on strong correlations@xcite , it seems likely that if strong correlations play some role , it is more of a quantitative than of a qualitative nature .",
    "on the other hand , we note that even if sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 and other ruthenates are not strongly correlated , the superconductivity could still be unconventional , for instance arising from a magnetic mechanism . in this regard ,",
    "a number of measurements indicate anomalously large scattering of electrons by spin fluctuations@xcite , complicated by a strong magnetoelastic coupling@xcite .",
    "cyclotron masses@xcite , the specific heat , and the paramagnetic susceptibility @xcite are all strongly renormalized .",
    "while there is always the possibility of ascribing this renormalization to strong correlations , the simplest explanation may be strong electron - phonon - magnon interactions .",
    "further , an abnormally large transport coupling constant , @xmath20 is required to rationalize the temperature dependence of the resistivity with the calculated drude plasma energies@xcite , although this value is consistent with the specific heat enhancement .",
    "unusual temperature dependencies of the hall effect @xcite were found in caruo@xmath0 and in srruo@xmath0 .",
    "we shall return to the transport properties later in the paper ; it is plausible that they can be reconciled with the conventional one - electron mechanism , despite the unusual @xmath21dependences .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to study the magnetic phases and the relative importance of correlation and band structure effects for obtaining the magnetic properties .",
    "we focus on the double perovskite sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 and the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition in ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 with increasing ca content , and we shall show that conventional band theory is fully able to describe the variegated magnetic properties in this family of materials .",
    "as mentioned , srruo@xmath0 occurs in an orthorhombic , pbnm , gdfeo@xmath0 structure , which has four formula units per cell .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is the same generic structure as lamno@xmath0 and related manganites that have received considerable recent attention because of the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance effects in some of these .",
    "further srruo@xmath0 has the same nominal @xmath12 electron count as lamno@xmath0 , although unlike lamno@xmath0 it is a ferromagnetic metal even without doping . in lamno@xmath0",
    "the distortion from the ideal cubic perovskite crystal structure consists of both rotations of the o octahedra and jahn - teller distortions of them to yield mn - o bond length variations of more than 10% .",
    "this is understood in ionic terms as a result of the fact that the high spin mn ion with this electron count has a half full majority spin e@xmath22 orbital favoring a jahn - teller distortion .",
    "in contrast , srruo@xmath0 occurs with a reduced magnetic moment and its distortion consists of almost rigid rotations of the o octahedra with practically no accompanying variations in the ru - o bond lengths .",
    "caruo@xmath0 occurs in the same crystal structure and symmetry as srruo@xmath0 , also with no evident jahn - teller distortion of the o octahedra , but with approximately twice larger rotations .",
    "such rotations are common in perovskite based materials and are usually understandable in terms of ionic size mismatches between the a and b site cations .",
    "such an explanation is consistent with the trend observed in ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 since the ca@xmath23 ionic radius is approximately 0.15   smaller than sr@xmath23 .",
    "although caruo@xmath0 is paramagnetic , it is believed to be rather close to magnetic instability .",
    "sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 is an antiferromagnetic insulator that occurs in a distorted but well ordered double perovskite structure .",
    "this is derived from the perovskite , srruo@xmath0 by replacing every second ru by y , such that the remaining ru ions form an fcc lattice .",
    "the structural units are thus ru - o and y - o octahedra , with the sr ions in the a site positions providing charge balance .",
    "each ru - o octahedra shares a single o atom with each neighboring y - o octahedra , and vice versa , but there are no common o ions shared between different ru - o octahedra .",
    "the primary distortions from the ideal perovskite derived structure , consist of ( 1 ) a substantial breathing of the octahedra to increase the y - o distance to 2.2  at the expense of the ru - o distances which become 1.95  and ( 2 ) rotations of the octahedra to reduce the closest sr - o distances , consistent with the ionic sizes .",
    "these distortions reduce the symmetry to monoclinic ( p21/n )",
    ". a related view of the crystal structure is based on the fact that y , like sr is fully ionized in such oxides , and accordingly is a spectator ion providing space filling and charge to the active ru - o system but playing no direct role in the electronic or magnetic properties . from this point of view , sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 consists of independent rigid , but tilted , ( ruo@xmath2)@xmath24octahedral clusters , arranged on a slightly distorted fcc lattice . hopping then proceeds between ru ions in neighboring ruo@xmath2 clusters via two intervening o ions    since y is tri - valent , the ru is formally 5-valent ( @xmath25 ) in this compound instead of formally tetra - valent as in perovskite srruo@xmath0 . in the octahedral crystal field ,",
    "the ru @xmath26 orbitals lie below the @xmath27 orbitals , so that in the high spin state the majority spin ru @xmath26 manifold would be fully occupied , and all other ru 4d orbitals unoccupied .",
    "this jahn - teller stable configuration is consistent with the experimental observation that the bond angles and bond lengths within the ru - o octahedra are almost perfectly equal , but the ru moment of 1.85 @xmath6/ru measured using neutron diffraction is considerably smaller than the 3 @xmath6/ru that would be expected in the high - spin configuration .",
    "first principles studies of srruo@xmath0 have shown that its electronic structure involves rather strong ru - o covalency , and that o @xmath14-derived states participate substantially in the magnetism and the electronic structure near the fermi energy , which is important for understanding the transport properties . as will be discussed below",
    ", a similar covalency is present in caruo@xmath0 and the differences in the magnetic ground states of caruo@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 are due to band structure effects related to the modulation of the ru - o hybridization by the structural distortion . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that ru@xmath28o hybridization may be even stronger in sr@xmath1yruo@xmath29 , based on the expectation that the o @xmath30 manifold would be even higher in energy with respect to the ru @xmath12 states .",
    "the similar ru - o distances in srruo@xmath0 and sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 ( less than 0.03  longer than in sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 ) and the fact that 5 is not a common oxidation state for ru also suggest strong covalency in the double perovskite . here",
    "we report density functional calculations of the electronic and magnetic properties of sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 .",
    "these confirm the strongly hybridized view of these materials and provide an explanation for the electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "the electronic structure of srruo@xmath0 has been described elsewhere@xcite . here",
    "we repeat , for completeness , the main results , and also discuss some quantitative differences between the published calculations .",
    "there have been two recent band structure calculations for srruo@xmath0@xcite . in both",
    "works the calculations were performed for both an idealized cubic perovskite structure and the experimental crystal structure .",
    "et al_@xcite interpreted their experimental measurements in terms of the band structure calculated within the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) using the linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto ) method .",
    "singh @xcite used the general potential linearized augmented plane - waves ( lapw ) method to calculate electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "the two studies yielded reasonably similar results for the electronic structures near the fermi energy although some noticeable differences are present .",
    "important for interpreting experimental results are the differences in the density of states and in the fermi velocities .",
    "the latter were found in ref . to be almost isotropic , while in ref .",
    "strong anisotropy of the fermi velocity ( about 30% in each channel ) was reported .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 found in ref .",
    "is 50% larger than that in ref . .",
    "most important , the overall shape of the density of states within a @xmath32 ry window at the fermi level is rather different .",
    "it is known that the accuracy of the atomic sphere approximation calculations can be difficult to control for materials with open crystal structures and low site symmetries due to sensitivity to the computational parameters ( e.g. , basis set , inclusion of empty spheres in lattice voids , linearization parameters etc . ) .",
    "since we wanted to use lmto - asa technique in analyzing the calculated band structure , we have repeated the lapw calculations reported in ref . using a standard lmto - asa package _",
    "stuttgart-4.7_. we found it necessary to include 10 empty spheres per formula unit to achieve adequate space filling in the distorted structure ( in the cubic perovskite structure this was not needed ) .",
    "the result appeared to be much closer to the lapw results of ref .",
    "than to the lmto ones of ref . ; ref .",
    "does not mention use of any empty spheres , in which case insufficient space filling could have influenced the calculation .",
    "the results given here are from lapw calculations , except where specifically noted otherwise .",
    "calculations for srruo@xmath0 in the ideal perovskite structure yielded a spin moment of 1.17 @xmath6 per formula unit , while calculations including the experimentally observed rotations yielded a larger moment of 1.59 @xmath6 in accord with recent experimental results .",
    "only a portion of the total moment resides on the ru sites ( 64% in the lapw mt sphere , and 67% in the lmto atomic sphere ) .",
    "the electronic density of states has a gap in the spin majority channel which is only 20 mry above the fermi level .",
    "the fact that srruo@xmath0 is so close to a half - metal is important for understanding its transport properties , and the fact that they are so sensitive to magnetic ordering ( and , correspondingly , to temperature ) .",
    "experimentally , caruo@xmath0 is a paramagnetic metal .",
    "this fact suggests that the rotation of ruo@xmath2 the octahedra is antagonistic to magnetism ( since larger rotations constitute the main structural difference between caruo@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , this conjecture is apparently at odds with the calculated result that the equilibrium magnetization in srruo@xmath0 is smaller in an ideal cubic perovskite structure than in the actual distorted one . as a first step to understanding this ,",
    "we have extended our calculations to caruo@xmath0 in its experimental structure .",
    "details of the method are as in ref .. the resulting density of states is shown in fig.[cr3-dos ] .",
    "we find that indeed the magnetism is suppressed in this case , though in a very borderline fashion . fixed spin moment calculations of the total energy as a function of spin magnetization for caruo@xmath0 show a very extended flat region , extending to near 1.5 @xmath6 per formula unit .",
    "this is reminiscent of fcc pd which also shows such a flat region .",
    "this borderline state implies a high spin susceptibility and explains the fact that low doping can induce a ferromagnetic state .",
    "further , para - magnon like spin excitations should be very soft in this material and magnetic impurities may be expected to induce giant induced local moments .",
    "there are already some reports that this is the case in caruo@xmath0 @xcite .    having shown that the ferromagnetism in srruo@xmath0 and its suppression in caruo@xmath0 can be described using band structure methods",
    ", we turn to the question of why these two perovskites have different magnetic properties .",
    "to determine whether the key difference between the materials is structural we have performed calculations for caruo@xmath0 using the crystal structure of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "these calculations yield a spin magnetization of 1.68 @xmath6 per formula unit and a magnetic energy of 0.06 ev / ru , very similar to srruo@xmath33 .",
    "calculations for the intermediate structure formed by a linear average of the experimental caruo@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 structures , yield a similar spin moment of 1.53 @xmath6 per formula unit and a magnetic energy of only 0.029 ev / ru ( note the similarity of the magnetizations and large variation of magnetic energy ) . to within the accuracy of our calculations",
    "this paramagnetic - ferromagnetic energy difference becomes zero just at the experimental caruo@xmath0 structure .",
    "since ferromagnetism in the ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 is apparently strongly coupled to the rotation of the octahedra , alloying the a site cation is expected to be an effective means for tuning the magnetic properties .",
    "alloying caruo@xmath0 with larger divalent cations should generally induce ferromagnetism while alloying srruo@xmath0 with smaller cations should suppress ferromagnetism .",
    "baruo@xmath0 , while a known compound , occurs in a different crystal structure and is not magnetic .",
    "however , pb can be partially substituted on the sr site , and it is known that introduction of this slightly larger divalent cation does increase @xmath7 in srruo@xmath0 .    later in the paper",
    "we shall analyze the transformation of the band structure of ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 upon increase of the tilting in more detail and will show that the nonmonotonic dependence of the equilibrium magnetization on tilting is a straightforward consequence of a natural evolution of the band structure near @xmath34 with the structural distortion .",
    "the electronic and magnetic structure of sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 was calculated using the full experimental crystal structure of battle and macklin @xcite except that the very small ( 0.23% ) lattice strain was neglected .",
    "additional calculations were performed for idealized structures neglecting the tilting of the octahedra to help understand the role of this distortion , which changes the angles and distances along the ru - o - o - ru hopping paths .",
    "these local density approximation calculations were performed using the general potential lapw method @xcite including local orbital extensions @xcite to accurately treat the o @xmath35 states and upper core states of sr and y as well as to relax any residual linearization errors associated with the ru @xmath12 states .",
    "a well converged basis consisting of approximately 2700 lapw basis functions in addition to the local orbitals was used with o sphere radii of 1.58 a.u . and",
    "cation radii of 2.10 a.u .",
    "this self - consistent approach has a flexible representation of the wavefunctions in both the interstitial and sphere regions and makes no shape approximations to either the potential or charge density .",
    "as such it is well suited to materials with open structures and low site symmetries like sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we used the lmto method in the atomic sphere approximation and tight - binding representation@xcite ( stuttgart code , version 4.7 ) to get better insight in the calculated electronic structure .",
    "the lmto - asa method is less accurate than the full - potential lapw but it provides more flexibility in the way how the results are represented and how they can be analyzed in tight - binding language .",
    "calculations were performed at the experimental structure for ferromagnetic ( f ) and the observed antiferromagnetic ( af ) orderings .",
    "the af ordering is 0.095 ev / ru lower in energy than the f ordering , and has an insulating gap in the band structure , consistent with the experimental ground state .",
    "the insulating gap of 0.08 ev is between majority and minority spin states and may yield only a weak optical signature .",
    "the ru moment as measured by the magnetization within the ru lapw sphere is 1.70 @xmath6 for the af state and 1.80 @xmath6 with the f ordering , in reasonable accord with the neutron scattering results the similar moments with different spin configurations suggests that a local moment picture of the magnetism is appropriate for sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast to perovskite srruo@xmath0 .",
    "similar to srruo@xmath0 there are substantial moments within the o lapw spheres as well as the ru spheres , amounting to approximately 0.10 @xmath6/o ( af ordered ) and 0.12 @xmath36/o ( f ordered ) .",
    "these can not be understood as tails of ru 4d orbitals extending beyond the lapw sphere radii , since such an explanation is inconsistent with the radial dependence of these orbitals , but rather they arise from polarization of the o ions due to hybridization , which is evidently strong both from this point of view and from the calculated electronic structure , discussed below .",
    "the total local moment per formula unit is of mixed ru and o character and amounts to 3 @xmath6/f.u .",
    ", which is approximately 60% ru derived and 40% o derived ( the interstitial polarization of 0.5 - 0.7 @xmath6/cluster derives from both ru and o , but is assigned as mostly o in character based on the extended 2p orbitals of negative o ions and the small o sphere radius , and results of lmto - asa calculations which do not have any interstitial volume ) .",
    "the calculated exchange splittings of the o 1s core levels are 80 to 95 mev depending on the particular o site .",
    "the o polarizations may be observable in neutron experiments if o form factors are included with ru in the refinement . such an experiment",
    "is strongly suggested by the present results .",
    "projections of the electronic density of states ( dos ) of antiferromagnetic sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 onto the lapw spheres are shown in fig .",
    "[ dos - syr - af ] , where majority and minority spin projections onto a ru ion and the six o ions in its cluster are shown .",
    "the dos in two spin channels are similar in shape apart from an exchange splitting throughout the valence energy region and shows evidence of a strongly hybridized electronic structure .",
    "the details of this structure are deferred to the tight binding analysis below , except to mention the exchange splitting of the essentially pure o 2p states between -4 and -6 ev relative to the fermi energy ( @xmath34 ) and the fact that there are substantial ru 4d contributions to the minority spin channel between -4 and -6 ev as well as o contributions above @xmath34 implying that the average ru 4d occupancy is considerably higher than d@xmath37 .",
    "although assigning charge in a crystal to various atoms is an ambiguous procedure , integration of the d - like dos implies an average near d@xmath38 similar to perovskite srruo@xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic moments derive from polarization of three bands near @xmath34 by an exchange splitting of 1 ev .",
    "the f ordered dos ( fig .",
    "[ dos - syr - f ] ) is very similar to that in the af state , but the exchange splitting is somewhat smaller and the bandwidth somewhat larger , resulting in a slight semimetallic overlap of majority and minority spin bands at @xmath34 which reduces the spin moment from 3.0 to 2.97 @xmath6/f.u ..    parallel calculations were performed using a structure in which the tilting of the ruo@xmath2 clusters is suppressed . as with the actual experimental structure , the af ordering is lower in energy than the f ordering .",
    "however , in this case the band structures are metallic for both orderings , showing that the tilting is crucial for the insulating state . as will be discussed below",
    "there is a substantial coupling between the magnetic order and this structural degree of freedom .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , the easiest compound to understand is the sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 double perovskite .",
    "sr and y , as is common in perovskites , are fully ionic , so that the states around the fermi level barely have any sr or y character .",
    "thus , as mentioned , this compound can be viewed as consisting of rigid ruo@xmath39 octahedra , arranged on an fcc lattice , and loosely connected to each other .",
    "we will show below that this intuitive picture provides very good qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the full - scale band structure calculation .",
    "in contrast with sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 or sr@xmath40ca@xmath41ruo@xmath9 no octahedra share oxygens . the octahedra are slightly tilted , which we shall neglect for the moment ( the effect of tilting is in a certain sense important and will be discussed later ) .",
    "accordingly , we begin by discussing a single cluster .",
    "the electronic structure of a single ruo@xmath2 cluster is governed by the relative position of ru @xmath12 and o @xmath14 levels , and the corresponding hopping amplitudes .",
    "the ru @xmath12 states are split by the crystal field into two manifolds consisting of 3 @xmath26 and 2 @xmath27 levels , respectively , and these are separated by @xmath42 ev .",
    "the o @xmath14 levels are subject to a crystal field splitting at least three times smaller , and yield 9 @xmath43 states , which form @xmath44 bonds with ru , plus three @xmath45 states , which participate in the @xmath46 bonding . after including @xmath47 hopping ,",
    "the system of levels becomes , for each spin channel : 13 nonbonding : 4@xmath48 5 bonding : 2@xmath49 and 5 antibonding : 2@xmath50 where @xmath51 are pure ionic levels , and @xmath52 ^ 2 + 16t_\\sigma ^2}\\},$ ] @xmath53 ^ 2 + 16t_\\pi ^2}.$ ] the actual ordering of levels in ruo@xmath8 as shown on fig.[levels ] is @xmath54 .",
    "the last inequality leads to a substantial gap ( @xmath55 2 ev ) between the antibonding @xmath56 and the    antibonding @xmath57 bands in the solid .",
    "this large gap is only partially due to the crystal field , and arises largely from the stronger ( relative to @xmath58 @xmath59 bonding .",
    "the exchange splitting is , naturally , weaker than this enhanced crystal field splitting , and the hund s rule does not apply to the high - lying antibonding @xmath60 states , which remain empty in both spin channels . neglecting those states , there are 21 levels to be occupied by 39 valence electrons . here",
    "hund s rule does apply and tells us to populate all 21 spin - majority states , and all but the three antibonding @xmath56 levels in the spin - minority channel .",
    "thus for the electronic properties of the crystal these six spin - up and spin - down @xmath56 molecular orbitals are of primary relevance ; the symmetry of these orbitals is the same as for @xmath61 states in a transition metal ion .",
    "we now use this information to analyze the electronic structure of crystalline sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 .",
    "when a solid is built out of the clusters , the molecular levels broaden into bands , which however remain quite narrow in this material .",
    "although the main intercluster hopping occurs via @xmath62 matrix elements ( here and below we mean for @xmath12 the ru - o molecular orbitals with the effective @xmath19symmetry ) , the intercluster distance is large and the effective hopping amplitude is small .",
    "thus one may conjecture that the valence band formed out of the majority spin molecular @xmath56 orbitals , and the corresponding minority spin band do not overlap , and that the crystal , in either the ferro- or antiferromagnetic states , remains insulating .",
    "a more detailed analysis , as discussed later in the paper , reveals a difference between the ferro- and antiferromagnetic ordering , namely that the bandwidth is slightly larger , and the exchange splitting slightly smaller in the former case .",
    "in fact , our lda calculations , described above , yield an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state , with a small gap of about 0.07 ev ; they also give a metastable semimetallic ferromagnetic state , with a band overlap of a few mev .",
    "let us now analyze this band structure in the tight - binding terms .",

    "@xmath68 hopping effects are responsible for the deviations from the dispersion above by about 0.1 ev .",
    "importantly , there is no repulsion between the valence bands and the conduction bands , because they are fully spin polarized with the opposite spins . this situation changes , however , in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "the observed magnetic ordering corresponds to ferromagnetic 001 planes stacked antiferromagnetically .",
    "each ruo@xmath2 cluster has thus 4 neighbors with the same and 8 neighbors with the opposite spin .",
    "correspondingly , of three @xmath56 derived bands one ( @xmath70 ) remains essentially the same as in the ferromagnet , and two other loose their dispersion to the first order in @xmath71 since the relevant neighboring clusters have only states of the opposite spin at this energy .",
    "instead , for those bands there is a hybridization between the valence and the conduction bands , because now the orbitals with the same spin on the neighboring clusters belong to these different bands .",
    "the hybridization matrix element is @xmath72 and produces an additional bonding energy @xmath73 per cluster ( @xmath74 ev is the exchange splitting ) .",
    "this yields about 0.08 ev which is very close to the calculated lda energy difference ( 0.12 ev ) between the afm and fm configurations in the ideal undistorted structure . in the actual crystal structure",
    "the oxygen octahedra are tilted by about 12@xmath75 , so that @xmath76 is reduced by about 15% ( neglecting @xmath77 etc . ) , yielding @xmath78 ev .",

    "it is worth noting that while this mechanism gives an effective antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath81 the underlying physics is very similar to , but not identical with , the usual superexchange interaction in 3@xmath12 oxides , @xmath82 .",
    "the differences are that instead of metal - oxygen - metal hopping here the relevant hopping is direct cluster - cluster hopping and the energy denominator is the band gap due mainly to intracluster exchange , rather than coulomb correlations described by a hubbard @xmath16 .",
    "one can also estimate the neel temperature , using the above value for @xmath83 to do that , let us begin with noting that this system represents a very good approximation to the antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor fcc model .",
    "the strong magnetoelastic coupling discussed below does not favor non - collinear spin configurations , so the direction of the cluster magnetic moments is fixed .",
    "the magnetic coupling @xmath84 with the next nearest neighbors can be safely neglected .",

    "although @xmath85 is larger than @xmath86 usually by a factor of the order of 2 , the larger distance , in the canonical scaling @xmath87 gives a factor of @xmath88 and the energy denominator in the equation for @xmath89 is about 10 times larger . taken together , one expects @xmath84 to be at least two order of magnitudes smaller than @xmath83 the antiferromagnetic fcc ising model is well studied@xcite . despite magnetic frustration",
    ", it has a neel temperature of approximately 1.76@xmath90 for the spin 1/2 and approximately 1.33 @xmath90 for the spin 1 , which in our case corresponds to 700900 k. the measured @xmath11 is 26 k , in apparent severe disagreement with our estimate .    it is tempting to ascribe this to intracluster hubbard - like correlation effects , which can increase the gap and reduce @xmath83 moreover , since the @xmath26 band width is only 1 ev , even a moderate hubbard repulsion could affect @xmath91 .",
    "one can get a very rough upper estimate this effect as follows : the energy of the coulomb repulsion of two electrons placed in two @xmath26 orbital on the same cluster is ( assuming about equal population on ru and o ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the coulomb repulsion of two electrons localized on two neighboring oxygens etc .. @xmath94 ev ; @xmath95 is believed to be about 1.5 ev@xcite , and for @xmath96 we use 3 ev , keeping in mind that the charge - transfer metal - oxygen energy for the 3d oxides is about 4.5 ev and the metal - oxygen distance is 50% smaller there . then , we arrive at @xmath97 ev .",
    "it is unclear to what extent this @xmath16 will be reduced by screening by surrounding cluster and by intracluster charge redistribution , but this effect would definitely be substantial .",
    "anyway , using 3 ev as a very safe upper bound , we get for the lower bound on 2@xmath91 approximately 0.03 ev , which corresponds to @xmath15 of at least 300 k. thus , strong correlations alone can not explain anomalously low neel temperature of this compound .",

    "the thermodynamics of such a system is interesting and unusual , but its discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the long - range order in the nearest - neighbors antiferromagnetic fcc ising model appears exclusively because of the finite temperature entropy contribution to the free energy@xcite . while at @xmath115 there is an infinite number of degenerate states , ordered in two dimensions and disordered in the third one , at @xmath116 this degeneracy",

    "it follows from the above discussion , however , that the ground state is always either ferro- or paramagnetic .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast with classical localized magnetic materials , like nio or feo , where even when ferromagnetism is imposed , oxygen is polarized only very weakly , and the magnetization of the metal ion is even smaller than for the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "it is also in contrast with the ferromagnetic colossal magnetoresistance mn oxides , where the antiferromagnetic ground state is destroyed by the double exchange interaction , competing with superexchange .",
    "these ruthenates have integer occupancy of the valence band , and thus double exchange is not operative",
    ". however , covalency effects , which are strong because of the large @xmath47 hopping and the near - degeneracy of the ru @xmath187 and o @xmath188 states , are operative .",
    "this strong covalency is what requires part of the magnetic moment to reside on the oxygen , since exchange splitting the ru @xmath12 states without the o would require disrupting the covalent bonding .    in the crystal structures where it is possible to maintain o moments without ferromagnetic ordering , an antiferromagnetic state is likely to form ( as in sr@xmath1yruo@xmath189 but where it is not possible , like srruo@xmath9",
    "a ferromagnetic ground state occurs instead .",
    "it is also worth noting that besides the double perovskite sr@xmath1yruo@xmath8 where oxygen ions can polarize both in the ferro- and antiferromagnetic structure , and single perovskites sr@xmath40ca@xmath41ruo@xmath0 , there exist intermediate layered structures , which consist of perovskite ( sr , ca)o@xmath1 layers . using the same arguments",
    ", we conjecture that if such compounds are magnetic , the effect of oxygen will cause ferromagnetic ordering inside layers , while interlayer coupling is strong ferromagnetic if the layers are sharing apical oxygens , but may be antiferromagnetic if they are connected by intermediate rocksalt layers ( like in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 ) .",
    "the observed crystal structure of both srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath0 is characterized by a substantial tilting of the ruo@xmath2 octahedra . in srruo@xmath0",
    "the octahedra are rotated by 8@xmath190 and in caruo@xmath0 the distortion is about twice larger . in fig.[sr3+cr3 ] we show the density of states in the @xmath56 band for these three different structures .",

    "this second pseudogap thus appears to be near the fermi level .",
    "one factor , band narrowing , tends to increase the equilibrium magnetization , but another one , the second pseudogap at the fermi level , works against it .",
    "the actual trend looks like this : at small distortions the equilibrium magnetization grows . at some critical distortion magnitude , which is not far from the observed equilibrium distortion for srruo@xmath0 ,",
    "the magnetization reaches a maximum and starts to decline .",
    "the first principles calculations show little difference between srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath17 provided the same crystal structure is used , so the main difference in the observed behavior is indeed due to the different distortion magnitudes .    to understand the changes caused by the tilting distortion it is instructive to look at the extended stoner plots for different distortions .",
    "[ sr3+cr3-st ] shows such plots for srruo@xmath0 in the experimental structure , in the cubic ( ideal perovskite ) structure , and for caruo@xmath0 , as well as for caruo@xmath0 in the srruo@xmath0 structure .",
    "one may immediately note the extreme instability of the cubic structure , due to discussed peak at the fermi level .",

    "tilting , like that in the experimentally observed srruo@xmath0 structure , the peak broadens and it takes larger exchange fields to fully split this peak into occupied and unoccupied peaks .",
    "finally , at even larger tiltings , corresponding to caruo@xmath0 , the peak is suppressed . in the effective density of states , as shown on fig.[sr3+cr3-st ] , this results in a nearly flat plateau , extending from @xmath195 to @xmath196 @xmath197 accidentally , this plateau matches nearly exactly @xmath198 calculated as described in the previous section . in other words , the total energy of caruo@xmath0 is nearly independent of magnetization up to @xmath199 @xmath200 the total energy as a function of magnetization is shown on fig.[fixedm ] , where the results of the fixed - spin - moment lapw calculations are compared with the same energy differences in the stoner theory@xcite .",

    "this should effect the transport , magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "unusual transport properties of srruo@xmath0 are due to the following three peculiarities : ( 1 ) while the dos in both spin subsystems are nearly the same , the partial plasma frequency in the majority spin channel is 3 times larger than in the minority spin channel , a manifestation of the proximity to the half - metallic regime , which would occur if the magnetization were 2 @xmath36 instead of 1.59 @xmath197 ( 2 ) there is strong coupling between electrons , phonons , and magnons , which probably produces substantial spin - flip scattering of electrons , and ( 3 ) in both spin channels the fermi surfaces consist of several sheets of complicated topology : hole - like , electron - like , and open , so that hole - like and electron - like parts compensate each other .",
    "let us start with the electric resistivity , and assume for simplicity that two bands are present , spin - up and spin - down .",

    "experimentally , the resistivity initially increases rather quickly .",
    "allen et al @xcite observed a low - temperature power law @xmath222 klein et al @xcite found that below 10 k the resistivity can be reasonably well fit with a quadratic law , but an even better fit ( linear ) , was found for up to 30 k for the dependence of resistivity on magnetization .",
    "we interpret this observation as follows : a stronger than @xmath223 increase indicates that the excitations , responsible for the low - temperature scattering , have a sublinear dispersion .",
    "conventional magnons , with @xmath224 dispersion , produce @xmath225 in good agreement with the experiment .",
    "in fact , the experimental exponent is even below 2 , which is easily accountable for by the fermi surface effects : part of the temperature dependence comes from the term @xmath226 if it is proportional to @xmath227 this not the case in srruo@xmath9 where one of the two fermi surfaces ( majority spin ) is a small sheet with heavy electrons ( similarly , magnetic alloys where momentum conservation does not hold show @xmath228 see ref . ) .",
    "a possible problem with this interpretation of the low - temperature resistivity is that as was already noted@xcite , in elemental ferromagnets , the magnon - limited resistivity is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than what would be needed to explain the low - temperature resistivity of srruo@xmath0 ( where @xmath229 @xmath230 @xmath214cm / k@xmath231 this can be resolved if we invoke the anomalously large magnon - phonon coupling , which , as discussed above , originates from the crucial role played by oxygen in magnetic properties of ruthenates .",
    "the strong electron - magnon coupling at low temperature in srruo@xmath0 is closely related to the large electron - paramagnon coupling at high temperatures and in caruo@xmath220 one can make a rough estimate of the characteristic frequency of magnons responsible for the resistivity : the schindler - rice formula@xcite , derived for the @xmath232 paramagnon scattering should be qualitatively applicable here , because we also have light electrons which carry current and are scattered by magnons into a heavy , transport - inert band .",
    "this formula reads @xmath233 \\\\ j_n(x ) & = & \\int_0^x\\frac{4z^ndz}{\\sinh ^2(x/2)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and has asymptotic behavior at @xmath234 as @xmath235 and at @xmath236 as @xmath237 where @xmath238 is characteristic energy of the magnons . using the experimental number ( @xmath239 @xmath214cm / k@xmath240 and assuming that the magnon - limited part of the high - temperature resistivity is @xmath241 @xmath242cm / k , we arrive at @xmath243 k , which is a low , but not impossible number .",
    "the hall coefficient in srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath0@xcite has attracted considerable attention . in both compounds",
    "the hall constant @xmath244 shows an unusual temperature dependence , changing sign at @xmath245 k. at this point , however , the similarity ends . for each given temperature",
    "the hall resistivity @xmath246 in caruo@xmath0 is nearly perfectly proportional to the field , as it should be for ordinary hall processes . in srruo@xmath9 to the contrary , @xmath247 decreases substantially with temperature , and only well above @xmath15 does @xmath246 become a linear function of @xmath248 this closely resembles the so - called extraordinary hall effect in ferromagnets .",
    "the physics of the extraordinary hall effect is as follows : below @xmath249 the internal magnetic field is much larger than that applied in a typical hall experiment .",
    "however , the hall currents induced in different magnetic domains mutually cancel . the applied field acts by aligning domains and lifting this cancellation .",
    "this process defines the large slope of @xmath247 in low fields . at a field close to the saturation magnetization",
    "@xmath250 all domains are aligned and further change of the hall current is due to the applied field itself ( the ordinary hall effect ) .",
    "it is tempting to associate the nonlinear field dependence of the hall resistivity in srruo@xmath0 with this effect .",
    "however , this hypothesis has been discounted by the authors of ref . for the following reason : in standard extraordinary hall effect theory the intersection of the linear low - field and high - field asymptotes occurs at @xmath251 in srruo@xmath0 the position of the intersection is roughly the same for all temperatures below @xmath249 and falls between 3 and 4 t. magnetometer data",
    "show that @xmath250 is about 0.12 t at @xmath252 k , and , naturally , drops to zero at @xmath253 furthermore , a closer look at the data reveals that the slope of the hall coefficient changes in a smooth manner , unlike conventional ferromagnets , where it changes rather sharply near @xmath254 @xmath255    studies of the bulk magnetization in polycrystalline@xcite and single crystal@xcite samples of srruo@xmath0 show that the magnetization is not saturated even at applied fields of several t. this has been ascribed to the strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy , as measured by kanbayashi@xcite , and expected for a 4d magnet .",
    "although hysteresis measurements for the thin film samples on which hall measurements were taken apparently showed saturation near 1.5 t , we speculate that the domains may not yet be fully aligned at this field , yielding a continuing non - linear field dependence in the hall resistivity .    the sign reversal of the hall conductivity has received even more attention . in the literature",
    "two explanations can be found : one@xcite assumes different temperature dependences for the electron and hole scattering rates , because of the different scattering mechanism ( phonon vs. magnon ) , which may then yield a strong temperature dependence of the hall resistivity , and a sign change .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that this hypothesis should not work , since caruo@xmath0 is nonmagnetic , but still shows a sign - changing hall effect . instead the authors of ref . suggested that the sign may change because the number of electrons and holes in the energy window @xmath256 around the fermi energy may change with @xmath257 however , the sign reversal in caruo@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 could be due to different physical reasons .",
    "this possibility is also suggested by the very different field dependence of the hall resistivity in the two cases . on the other hand , it follows from our calculations , and is also indicated by various experiments , that caruo@xmath0 is on the verge of a magnetic instability , and the interplay between the phonons and paramagnons may play much the same role as the interplay between the phonons and magnons in srruo@xmath18 furthermore , besides the temperature dependence of the relaxation rates and the temperature broadening of the fermi level , there is yet another effect which may cause the sign change in srruo@xmath0 .",
    "the exchange splitting must be very temperature dependent in srruo@xmath220 unlike common ferromagnets like fe , where the curie temperature corresponds to disordering of local moments , here the magnetization _ disappears at t_@xmath258 including the _ local _ magnetization .",
    "thus , the spin splitting changes with the temperature , essentially disappearing around @xmath259 this is in contrast with most ferromagnets where an effective local spin splitting exists well above @xmath249 without any macroscopic magnetization .",
    "thus , the band structure itself is strongly temperature dependent .",
    "this effect can be operative in srruo@xmath0 in addition to the two other possible mechanisms .",
    "the prerequisite for any of these mechanisms to be relevant is that there is strong compensation between the hole - like and the electron - like contributions from the different bands . to check this ,",
    "we have calculated the hall conductivity @xmath260 and the hall coefficient @xmath261 for all the individual bands in srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath9 following the procedure described in ref .. the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ hallsr3 ] .",
    "it was observed by schultz _ et al_@xcite that quantitative calculations of the hall coefficient are extremely sensitive to sampling of the brillouin zone ; it is impractical for these 20 atom per unit cell structures to calculate the first principles band structure at a * k-*mesh comparable with the ultradense meshes used in ref . for elemental metals and instead we have relied on interpolation between first principles band energies calculated at 100 points in the irreducible wedge of the zone .",
    "thus , our calculations shown in fig . [ hallsr3 ] can not be taken quantitatively , but rather illustrate the qualitative fact , that the hall conductivity has different signs in different bands and spin channels .",
    "the net hall conductivity is defined by strong cancellation of hole- and electron - like contributions from different bands sc which in turn is very sensitive to relative position of different bands .",
    "evidently , this balance can be easily violated by such temperature - dependent factors as lattice distortion , magnetization , and relaxation times . the mechanism suggested by klein et",
    "al @xcite is also possible , since the net hall conductivity does change sign within a few hundred k around @xmath34 .",
    "finally , very recent measurements@xcite of the hall coefficient in mixed sr@xmath40ca@xmath41ruo@xmath0 samples showed that for intermediate concentrations it does not change sign with temperature , suggesting that the sign reversals in pure compounds are accidental and unrelated .",
    "at this time there is already a fairly substantial body of experimental literature on these ruthenates , including magnetic measurements , spectroscopic studies , specific heat data and determinations of electronic transport and superconducting properties .",
    "these measurements demonstrate unusual and perhaps unexpected properties , and many of these have been ascribed to correlation effects . for example , the specific heats in the metallic compounds show substantial enhancements over the bare band structure values , superconductivity occurs in a layered material in apparent proximity to magnetic phases , quasiparticle bands measured by arpes show weaker dispersion than band structure calculations , satellites are observed in angle integrated photoemission spectra , and the transport properties of the metallic phases are unusual , showing e.g. sign reversals in the hall coefficient . since this evidence clearly suggests something unusual about the perovskite - derived ruthenates , it is tempting to ascribe it to strong correlation effects , particularly since these effects are all either qualitatively in the direction expected for a correlated system or can conceivably arise from the additional complexity introduced by correlation effects .    on the other hand ,",
    "chemical trends lead to the expectation that , all things being equal , 4d ru oxides should be less prone to strongly correlated behavior than the corresponding 3d oxides , and much less prone to such effects than cuprates .",
    "this is because of the much more extended 4d orbitals in ru ions which should lead to stronger hybridization , better screening and lower effective hubbard @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , although much of the data are at first sight qualitatively in accord with general expectations for a correlated system , they have not been quantitatively explained in these terms , and there are some data that are rather difficult to understand purely in terms of a correlated scenario , most notably the disappearance of magnetism upon doping ca in the srruo@xmath0 system , and the ferromagnetic ground state in the integer occupancy ( and thus not a double - exchange system ) compound , srruo@xmath0 .",
    "we have performed first principles , band structure based calculations within the lsda for srruo@xmath0 , caruo@xmath0 and sr@xmath1yruo@xmath262 although this approach fails miserably in systems that are truly strongly correlated , it does yield the correct magnetic and electronic states in these materials , including quantitative agreement with known magnetic properties in all cases in these ruthenates . moreover , the different magnetic behaviors can be fully understood in terms of simple and straightforward one - electron tight binding models and stoner theory .",
    "although interpretation of the transport properties in terms of a conventional one - electron picture and bloch - boltzmann theory is not as straightforward , we show that such an approach is not inconsistent with the existing body of experimental evidence . a key notion for understanding",
    "the transport in these systems is strong electron - phonon-(para)magnon coupling , which in turn can be understood in the framework of the band theory .    in agreement with expectations based on chemical trends",
    ", rather strong hybridization is found between the ru 4d and o 2p states in these materials . while antagonistic to a strong correlation scenario this is in large part responsible for the unusual properties in our band picture , including the very fact that magnetism occurs at all in a 4d metallic oxide .",
    "this strong hybridization leads to a ferromagnetic direct exchange interaction between ru and o , and the cooperation between ru and o contributions to the stoner parameter leads to the magnetic ground states . as a result ,",
    "the o ions in these ruthenates make substantial contributions to the magnetization density , which may be observable in neutron scattering experiments with o form factors included in the refinements .",
    "the importance of @xmath263 hybridization also leads to a strong coupling of magnetic and structural degrees of freedom , resulting in for example the destabilization of the ferromagnetic state due to octahedral tilting in caruo@xmath0 .",
    "one consequence of our scenario is that when ru ions are bonded to the same o , as neighboring ru ions are in the perovskite structure , the interaction between them will be strongly ferromagnetic .",
    "this means that magnetic fluctuations in layered ruthenates like sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 and the associated ruddlesden - popper ( rp ) series of compounds , are predicted to have predominantly ferromagnetic character in plane , although alternating layers , or perovskite blocks in the rp series may be coupled antiferromagnetically to each other via superexchange through rocksalt blocks .",
    "such ferromagnetic fluctuations would be pair - breaking for singlet ( @xmath264 or @xmath19wave ) superconductivity , but not for triplet superconductivity , as suggested for instance by rice and sigrist@xcite for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath3 .",
    "in fact , for triplet pairing both magnetic fluctuations and phonons provide cooper attraction .",
    "finally , when ru ions are not connected at all via common o ions , like in sr@xmath1yruo@xmath2 the ru - ru coupling is via two intervening o ions , both of which are strongly hybridized with and ferromagnetically coupled to the nearest ru , but couple to each other via an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction .",
    "this results in an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "the strength and importance of covalent transition metal - oxygen interactions , combined with magnetism and metallicity is perhaps unique to these ruthenates .",
    "already a number of interesting physical properties have been found among these compounds , and no doubt more interesting physics remains to be found in this family .",

    ".      introduced by fert and campbell @xcite and often used since then , the two - current conduction model of transport in ferromagnetic metals assumes that the spin - up and spin - down distribution function changes are independent .",
    "this formula was derived for a very specific case of @xmath265 scattering in transition metals and under a number of simplifying assumptions . in the original papers @xcite",
    "no clear distinction was made between the spin - flip scattering ( which always influences the total conductivity ) and the spin - flip conductivity ( which vanishes when scattering - in is neglected ) . in a later publication @xcite this distinction has been made , but this publication is less well known .",
    "we find it instructive to present here a systematic derivation for the two - current model of electric transport in ferromagnets , and to show how it is related to the general theory of multiband conductivity .",
    "this derivation is based on allen s variational approach to multiband boltzmann equation@xcite and clearly shows some limits to the applicability of the two - current model .",
    "the boltzmann equation for electric transport in metals is @xmath266 where the subscripts @xmath267 include both the band index and the spin and @xmath268 is the transition probability matrix element , which can also be written conveniently in terms of the scattering matrix elements @xmath269 as @xmath270 for static ( impurity ) scattering , or the corresponding expression for the scattering by phonons , magnons etc .",
    "the change of the distribution function for given * k * is @xmath271 so that      @xmath272 and for @xmath234 @xmath273 allen introduced ( and called `` disjoint representation '' ) the following approximation : for each sheet of the fermi surface @xmath274 is proportional to * v*@xmath275 @xmath276 where the coefficients @xmath277 depend on the band ( and , in a magnet , on the spin ) . in this approximation ,",
