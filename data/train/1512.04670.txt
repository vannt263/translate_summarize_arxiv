    "two - dimensional materials have recently garnered interest not only for their remarkable electronic properties , but also for their mechanical behavior .",
    "graphene , for example , has been found to be incredibly strong and resilient .",
    "these two - dimensional membranes can be cut and folded to construct three - dimensional meta - materials @xcite .",
    "an open question is how the mechanical properties of such meta - materials are controlled by the geometry and topology of the cut and folded membrane .",
    "thermal fluctuations also have a significant effect on the material properties of membranes , as examined theoretically by nelson and peliti in the late 1980s @xcite .",
    "nelson and peliti found that for two - dimensional membranes with an in - plane shear modulus  variously referred to as crystalline , polymerized , or tethered membranes ",
    "the nonlinear coupling of thermally excited out - of - plane deformations to in - plane phonons generates an effective long - range interaction between the gaussian curvature .",
    "this results in the renormalization of the effective bending rigidity , increasing the rigidity at large lengthscales @xcite .",
    "possible evidence of such renormalization has only recently been observed experimentally in graphene @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the additional effects of topology and geometry on the effective properties of thermally fluctuating membranes .",
    "the introduction of slits or holes in a membrane can allow for configurations in which stretching energy is effectively converted into bending energy , or vice versa @xcite .",
    "such slits or holes can thus strongly affect the material properties ; for example , the spring constant of a spring formed by an array of slits is controlled by the number , size , and spacing of those slits @xcite .",
    "these effects can occur both for thermal membranes such as graphene , and for approximately athermal membranes such as paper .",
    "we address specifically the interplay of topology and geometry with thermal fluctuations , and the important question of how to understand a system in which both renormalization effects and the effects of slits and holes must be considered simultaneously .",
    "we find unexpected effects even in a very simple system : the thermal fluctuations of a simple rectangular ribbon are suppressed by the introduction of a single slit , that is , the slit effectively stiffens the ribbon in the presence of thermal fluctuations , with the size of the effect increasing with the length of the slit .",
    "we consider a generic two - dimensional crystalline membrane , with both a stretching energy and a bending energy , undergoing thermal fluctuations . in order to carry out explicit molecular dynamics simulations , we discretize the membrane by triangulating into equilateral triangles of side length @xmath0 .",
    "note that this discretization bears no direct relation to the true microscopically crystalline nature of the membrane ",
    "e.g.  for graphene , the microscopic crystalline structure is a hexagonal or honeycomb lattice rather than a triangular lattice  and we are not simulating the atomic - level behavior of the membrane . in the simulations reported here , we work primarily with rectangular ` ribbons ' of length @xmath1 and width @xmath2 ( expressed in units of the triangulation length ) , yielding 1188 vertices of the triangulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig_triangulation]a ) .",
    "these vertices are treated as ` particles ' of mass @xmath3 in a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "we hold fixed the first two rows of vertices , ` clamping ' the ribbon at one end ; this prevents overall motion of the ribbon during the simulation and imposes a boundary conditions on the normals to the ribbon surface , and thus reflects common experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "the stretching energy term @xcite , representing the effect of the ( two - dimensional ) young modulus @xmath4 of the membrane , is given by introducing harmonic bonds between adjacent vertices : @xmath5 with the sum taken over all pairs of adjacent vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the distance between the vertices ; @xmath9 ; and @xmath10 .",
    "the geometry of the triangulation relates this spring constant @xmath11 to the continuous young modulus @xmath4 by @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the bending energy @xcite , representing the effect of the bending rigidity @xmath13 of the membrane , is given by introducing an energy cost to changing the dihedral angle between adjacent faces of the triangulation : @xmath14 with the sum taken over all pairs of adjacent _ faces _ @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the normals to the faces ; @xmath19 the dihedral angle between the faces ; and @xmath20 .",
    "this constant @xmath21 is related to the continuous bending rigidity @xmath13 by @xmath22 @xcite . in a molecular dynamics simulation",
    "we need to compute force on each particle .",
    "the expression for the bending force is lengthy but can be straightforwardly obtained by computing the gradient of eq .   with respect to the vertex position .",
    "we note that both stretching and bending energy given in the above form are often referred to as `` harmonic '' and `` dihedral '' potential and are standard in most molecular dynamics packages .",
    "these parameters give an approximate _ fppl von krmn number _",
    ", @xmath23 the fppl von krmn number measures the relative energy scales of stretching and of bending ; for reference , this value is similar to that of a standard 8.5  @xmath24 11  sheet of paper .",
    "the approximate thermal length scale is @xcite @xmath25 this is the lengthscale above which the stretching energy of thermally excited phonons is similar to the bending energy , that is , the lengthscale at which thermal corrections to the renormalized bending rigidity are on the same order as the bare bending rigidity .",
    "note that the precise prefactor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lc ] ) is a modification on that reported in @xcite , calculated without truncating the integral . to introduce a slit",
    ", we simply delete the edges and faces of the triangulation which cross the slit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_triangulation]b ) .",
    "this changes both energy terms ; pairs of vertices joined by the deleted edges are removed from the stretching - energy sum , while dihedral angles involving deleted faces are removed from the bending - energy sum . in this work , we consider slits which run along the length of the ribbon , centered both in width and in length , such that both the clamped and free ends are uncut .",
    "we additionally consider a slit which extends to cut the free end , effectively giving two ribbons , each of half the total width , which are tethered together at the clamped end .",
    "we simulate an initially flat ribbon , with a small random vertical displacement added to each unclamped vertex ; this initial noise avoids the simulation getting trapped in the stationary state of the perfectly flat ribbon .",
    "simulations are carried out in an nvt ensemble using the hoomd - blue molecular dynamics toolkit ( version 1.0.1 ) published by the university of michigan @xcite , on a single gpu per simulation .",
    "the unit of time in these simulations is @xmath26 ; the simulation timestep used is @xmath27 , and simulations are run for @xmath28-@xmath29 ; we carry out between 2 and 40 independent simulations for each ribbon configuration to improve our statistics .",
    "a crucial consideration in molecular dynamics simulations of thermal systems is to determine the equilibration and relaxation times .",
    "we distinguish two very different timescales in this system .",
    "the ` equilibration time ' is the time it takes for the initial state with its added short - wavelength noise to decay to a typical state , so that the temperature and energy contributions reach their equilibrium values . for this system , this is on the order of @xmath30-@xmath31 ( fig .  [",
    "fig_equilibration]a ) .",
    "we thus consider the first @xmath31 as our equilibration period , and do not include the data from this period in our further analysis .",
    "simulation timesteps , showing the decay of transient states present in the initial random configuration .",
    "b ) evolution of the height of the free end of the ribbon in the first @xmath32 of a simulation , showing evidence of a thermally excited , long - lived oscillatory mode .",
    "c ) time correlation function of the height of the free end , showing this long - lived mode and its decay ; the red curve gives a fit of the data to the form @xmath33 with period @xmath34 , and decay constant @xmath35 .",
    "all panels show results for a ribbon with no slit ; results for ribbons with slits are similar , with some increase in the relaxation times . ]",
    "the ` relaxation time ' is the time in which thermally - excited modes decay , allowing for statistically independent sampling .",
    "this relaxation time is much longer than the initial equilibration time , and may depend on the quantity being sampled .",
    "we consider primarily the height of the free end of the ribbon , for which the relaxation time is about @xmath36 . the ribbon is approximately described by the euler - bernoulli theory for a bending beam @xcite , for which the equations of motion admit periodic solutions ; the lowest - energy such mode is thermally excited , as is apparent in the oscillations of the time trace of the height of the free end ( fig .",
    "[ fig_equilibration]b ) , and in a broad peak in the fourier - transform of this time trace ( data not shown ) .",
    "this mode decays quite slowly , as evident from the time correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_equilibration]c .",
    "thus in order to obtain statistically independent samples of the end height , our sampling time must be similar to the relaxation time .",
    "this restricts the number of independent samples we can obtain , requiring long simulations for good statistics . for the analyses reported below , we sample with a period of @xmath37 .",
    "as we have chosen a bending rigidity @xmath38 only a few times the thermal energy @xmath39 , thermal excitations cause the ribbons to fluctuate dramatically from their lowest energy , flat configuration ",
    "several snapshots of these fluctuations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_ribbons ] , and videos are available in the supplementary information .",
    "the ribbons are soft enough to sometimes bend back on themselves , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_ribbons]c , although these configurations are not common ; more frequently we see configurations such as in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_ribbons]a , b .",
    "we do not observe self - intersection of the ribbons , although this is not explicitly prevented by the simulation model .",
    "we confirm that the average height of the free end of the ribbon is consistent with zero , its expected equilibrium value .",
    "we then quantify the scale of the fluctuations by calculating the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "height @xmath40 of the free end of the ribbon , averaged over both the width of the ribbon and over time .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "height is expected to scale as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an _ effective _ bending rigidity .",
    "these soft ribbons have an r.m.s .",
    "height of @xmath43 .",
    "a slit in the ribbon allows for new configurations , in which a gap opens between the two sides of the ribbon ; snapshots of such configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_slits ] for several slit lengths .",
    "note that these gaps can become quite large .",
    "we see occasional examples of the two sides of the ribbon intersecting ( e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_slits]e ) , but such intersections are infrequent .",
    "interestingly , the presence of a slit significantly affects the overall scale of fluctuations of the ribbon .",
    "we quantify the effect by the change in the r.m.s .",
    "height of the free end of a ribbon ; fig .",
    "[ fig_rms_heights ] shows the variation of @xmath40 with the length of the slit .",
    "it is clear that the presence of the slit _ reduces _ the scale of the fluctuations , essentially _ stiffening _ the ribbon to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the effect is stronger for longer slits , with a maximum decrease of about 11% to @xmath44 for a slit extending 90% of the length of the ribbon ; this corresponds to an increase of about 20% in the effective bending rigidity @xmath42 .",
    "our results are suggestive that the effect is continuous , with the suppression present even for the shortest slits , with @xmath45 ; certainly the suppression is significant at the @xmath46 level for @xmath47 .",
    "the effect disappears when the slit is extended through the free end , effectively resulting in two independent ribbons each of half the total width ; indeed , in this case the behavior is consistent with that of a single ribbon of width @xmath48 , as shown by the rightmost two points in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluctuating_slits ] .",
    "these thinner ribbons have slightly larger fluctuations than the ribbon of with @xmath49 , corresponding to a softer effective bending rigidity as predicted by the renormalization theory of @xcite .",
    "we interpret this effective stiffening as being a result of the new gapped configurations , and of the relative freedom of the two sides of the ribbon . along the length of the slit , each side of the ribbon is equally likely to fluctuate either up or down .",
    "thus while in some cases both sides will fluctuate in the same direction simultaneously , resulting in a large fluctuation of the free end of the ribbon from the equilibrium mid - plane , there are also configurations in which the two sides fluctuate in opposing directions , so that at the end of the slit , the fluctuations partially cancel out , resulting in a smaller fluctuation of the free end .",
    "this effect is present over a larger distance for a longer slit , enhancing the suppression of the overall fluctuations .    ' represents a single ribbon of the same total length but half the width , @xmath48 .",
    "note that the r.m.s .",
    "height decreases as the slit length increases . ]",
    "the effect is also substantiated by quantitative estimates of the mean square height fluctuations which grow as the cube of the length @xmath50 of a ribbon . for a ribbon with a slit of length @xmath51 ,",
    "the fact that the two halves of the ribbon must rejoin at the end of the slit effectively imposes reflective boundary conditions about the midpoint of the slit lengthwise .",
    "this means that the section of the ribbon which is slit has an effective length less than @xmath51 , lowering the net height fluctuations .",
    "this slit - induced stiffening raises the question of whether this effect is present only for an unstressed ribbon , or whether it persists when the ribbon is under an applied load .",
    "we briefly investigate this question .",
    "we carry out simulations in which a constant ` downward ' force , perpendicular to the plane of the ribbon , is applied to the free end of the ribbon ; this mimics a mass attached to the free end .",
    "we apply a force of @xmath52 per vertex , applied to the 12 endmost vertices , giving a total force of @xmath53 ; this value was chosen to deflect the free end of the ribbon by about @xmath54 , or 10% of the length @xmath50 .",
    "for the single ribbon with half the width , @xmath48 , we use the same force per vertex on the 6 endmost vertices , giving a total force of @xmath55 , but the same force per unit width .",
    "all other simulation parameters are the same as in the simulations already discussed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_force_response]a , we show the profile of the average deflection as a function of length along the ribbon ( using the ribbon s internal coordinates ) , for several slit configurations .",
    "there is a marked contrast between the profiles of the three ribbons of width @xmath49 , and that of width @xmath48 .",
    "the three ribbons of width @xmath49 show similar behavior to one another , but the profiles seem to diverge around the middle of the ribbon , @xmath56 , with first the profile of the uncut ribbon falling below those of the slitted ribbons , and then the profile of the ribbon with a slit of length @xmath47 falling below that of the ribbon with a slit of length @xmath57",
    ".    ' represents a single ribbon of the same total length but half the width , @xmath48 .",
    "]    in fig .",
    "[ fig_force_response]b , we give the average deflection of the free end , @xmath58 , as a function of slit length ; this gives a measure of the effective bending rigidity , with expected scaling @xmath59 .",
    "the results are suggestive , though not conclusive , that the deflection decreases as the slit length increases , with the deflection for the slit of length @xmath57 about 11% smaller than that for the ribbon with no slit .",
    "this indicates again an effective stiffening due to the presence of the slit .",
    "an unexpected result is that the ribbon with half the width , @xmath48 , shows a smaller deflection than those ribbons of width @xmath49 under the same force per unit width , as does the ribbon with the slit cut all the way through the free end .",
    "this smaller deflection would indicate a stiffer effective bending rigidity , which is at odds with the prediction that the effective bending rigidity increase with width @xcite , and also in contrast to the trend seen in the fluctuation scale of unstressed ribbons .",
    "our results demonstrate the importance of interactions between topology and thermal fluctuations in two - dimensional membranes , which interactions will need to be more fully understood and considered in designing meta - materials made from these systems .",
    "we show that in the particular example of a slit in a thermally fluctuating ribbon , the slit generates a marked stiffening of the effective bending rigidity in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this non - intuitive effect depends on the presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we hypothesize that the topology allows for new thermally accessible configurations of the ribbon , i.e.  those gapped configurations in which the fluctuations partially cancel . in our example",
    ", the effect is moderate in size , with a change in the effective rigidity of on the order of 10 - 20% due to a single slit , but we anticipate that more complex topologies should yield larger effects , such as in the case of the springs reported in @xcite .",
    "many open questions remain , both about this simple system , and about the larger picture of controlling mechanical properties of 2d membranes using topology . further work on this system might determine the functional form of the bending rigidity as a function of slit length , and in particular , whether the stiffening effect is truly continuous , that is , present for an arbitrarily short slit , or whether it exhibits a threshhold behavior , such that there is a non - zero minimum length below which a slit has no effect .",
    "we also have only considered the material properties in the direction longitudinal to the axis of the split ; experiments demonstrate that deformations in the _ transverse _ direction can convert stretching energy to bending energy , dramatically softening the effective elastic modulus @xcite .",
    "this directional dependence on the effects of topology remains to be more completely understood .",
    "the experiments of @xcite also begin to explore the possibilities available using more complex arrangements of multiple slits and holes of different shapes ; understanding more fully the interactions among different geometric elements will be essential to controlling the properties of 2d membranes .",
    "the study of two - dimensional crystalline materials such as graphene as building blocks for nanoscale metamaterials is just beginning .",
    "simulations such as ours provide an essential complement to theory and experiment , providing insight into the ways in which we can control the properties of such materials using topology and geometry .",
