    "the possibility of constructing high energy polarized electron and positron beams is considered with great interest with regard to the physics programme at a linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "indeed , one of the most important advantages of initial beam polarization is that one can measure spin - dependent observables , which represent the most direct probes of the fermion helicity dependence of the electroweak interactions .",
    "consequently , one would expect a substantial gain in the sensitivity to the features of possible non - standard interactions and , in particular , stringent constraints on the individual new coupling constants could be derived from the data analysis by looking for deviations of the observables from the standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "contact interaction lagrangians ( ci ) provide an effective framework to account for the phenomenological effects of new dynamics characterized by extremely high intrinsic mass scales @xmath1 , at the ` low ' energies @xmath2 attainable at current particle accelerators .",
    "the explicit parameterization of the four - fermion quark and lepton contact interactions is , _ a priori _ , somewhat arbitrary . in general",
    ", it must respect @xmath3 symmetry , because the new dynamics are active well - beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "furthermore , usually one limits to the lowest dimensional operators , @xmath4 being the minimum , and neglects higher dimensional operators that are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath5 and therefore are expected to give negligible effects .    in this note , we consider the effects of the flavor - diagonal , helicity conserving @xmath6 contact - interaction effective lagrangian @xcite @xmath7 in the bhabha scattering process @xmath8 at an @xmath9 linear collider with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath10 and polarized electron and positron beams . in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) : @xmath11 denote left- or right - handed fermion helicities , @xmath12 indicates the fermion species , so that @xmath13 for the process ( [ proc ] ) under consideration , and the ci coupling constants are parameterized in terms of corresponding mass scales as @xmath14 .",
    "actually , one assumes @xmath15 to account for the fact that the interaction would become strong at @xmath16 , and by convention @xmath17 or @xmath18 , leaving the energy scales @xmath19 as free , _ a priori _ independent parameters .    for the case of the bhabha process ( [ proc ] ) , the effective lagrangian interaction in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) envisages the existence of three individual , and independent , ci models , contributing to individual helicity amplitudes or combinations of them , with _ a priori _ free , and non - vanishing , coefficients ( basically , @xmath20 combined with the @xmath21 signs ) .",
    "correspondingly , in principle the most general , and model - independent , analysis of the data must account for the situation where all four - fermion effective couplings defined in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) are simultaneously allowed in the expression for the cross section .",
    "potentially , the different ci couplings may interfere and substantially weaken the bounds .",
    "indeed , although the different helicity amplitudes by themselves do not interfere , _ the deviations from the sm _ could be positive for one helicity amplitude and negative for another , so that accidental cancellation might occur in the sought for deviations from the sm predictions for the relevant observables .",
    "it should be highly desirable to apply a general ( and model - independent ) approach to the analysis of experimental data , that allows to simultaneously include all terms of eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) as independent , non vanishing free parameters , and yet to derive separate constraints ( or exclusion regions ) on the values of the ci coupling constants , free from potential weakening due to accidental cancellations .",
    "such an analysis is feasible with initial beam longitudinal polarization and allows to extract the individual helicity cross sections from suitable combinations of measurable polarized cross sections and , consequently , to disentangle the constraints on the corresponding ci constants .",
    "with @xmath22 and @xmath23 the longitudinal polarization of the electron and positron beams , respectively , and @xmath24 the angle between the incoming and the outgoing electrons in the c.m .",
    "frame , the differential cross section of process ( [ proc ] ) at lowest order , including @xmath25 and @xmath26 exchanges both in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 channels and the contact interaction ( [ lagra ] ) , can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) : @xmath30 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this would allow the separate measurement of the polarized cross sections for each of the four polarization configurations rr , ll , rl and lr , corresponding to the four sets of beam polarizations @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , with @xmath45 . specifically , with the simplifying notation @xmath46 : @xmath47    to make contact to the experiment we take @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and impose a cut in the forward and backward directions . specifically , we consider the cut angular range @xmath50 and divide it into nine equal - size bins of width @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we also introduce the experimental efficiency , @xmath53 , for detecting the final @xmath9 pair , and according to the lep2 experience @xmath54 is assumed .",
    "the most natural choice of observables are the four , directly measurable , differential event rates integrated over each bin : @xmath55 where ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) , @xmath57 is the time - integrated luminosity , which is assumed to be equally divided among over the four combinations of electron and positron beams polarization defined in eqs .",
    "( [ cross4 ] ) .",
    "the current bounds on @xmath19 , of the order of several tev , are such that for the lc c.m .",
    "energy @xmath58  tev the characteristic suppression factor @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) is rather strong .",
    "accordingly , we can safely assume a linear dependence of the cross sections on the parameters @xmath60 .",
    "in this regard , indirect manifestations of the ci interaction ( [ lagra ] ) can be looked for , _ via _ deviations of the measured observables from the sm predictions , caused by the new interaction .",
    "the reach on the ci couplings , and the corresponding constraints on their allowed values in the case of no effect observed , can be estimated by comparing the expression of the mentioned deviations with the expected experimental ( statistical and systematic ) uncertainties .    to this purpose , assuming the data to be well described by the sm ( @xmath61 ) predictions , i.e. , that no deviation is observed within the foreseen experimental uncertainty , and in the linear approximation in @xmath60 of the observables ( [ obsn ] ) , we apply the method based on the covariance matrix : @xmath62 here , the @xmath63 are given by eq .",
    "( [ obsn ] ) , so that the statistical error appearing on the right - hand - side is given by @xmath64 and the @xmath65 are the observables .",

    "( [ covarv ] ) represent the systematic errors on the integrated luminosity @xmath57 , polarizations @xmath66 and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) corresponds to a fit with three free parameters .    the quadratic form ( [ chi2 ] ) defines a three - dimensional ellipsoid in the @xmath71 parameter space .",
    "the matrix @xmath72 has the property that the square roots of the individual diagonal matrix elements , @xmath73 , determine the projection of the ellipsoid onto the corresponding @xmath74-parameter axis in the three - dimensional space , and has the meaning of the bound at 95% c.l . on that parameter",
    "regardless of the values assumed for the others .",
    "conversely , @xmath75 determines the value of the intersection of the ellipsoid with the corresponding @xmath74-parameter axis , and represents the 95% c.l . bound on that parameter assuming all the others to be exactly known .",
    "accordingly , the ellipsoidal surface constrains , at the 95% c.l . and",
    "model - independently , the range of values of the ci couplings @xmath60 allowed by the foreseen experimental uncertainties .    the numerical results can be represented graphically . as an example , in figs .",
    "12 we show the planar ellipses that are obtained by projecting onto the two planes ( @xmath76 ) and ( @xmath77 ) the 95% c.l . allowed three - dimensional ellipsoid .    to appreciate the significant role of initial beam polarization we show in figs .",

    "as can be seen from those figures , the electron polarization is obviously essential to dramatically reduce the allowed domains of ci parameters with respect to the case of unpolarized beams .",
    "the results presented in figs .",
    "12 show that the increase in the sensitivity to the parameters @xmath60 due to the additional availability of positron polarization is quite useful .",
