    "in a previous work @xcite , we introduced and studied boundary components for mumford - tate domains , which are homogeneous classifying spaces @xmath3 for hodge structures with additional symmetries ( in a tannakian sense ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 is a reductive , connected @xmath5-algebraic group , @xmath6 the identity component of the ( lie ) group of real points , and @xmath7 a compact subgroup .",
    "the boundary components @xmath8 essentially parametrize all possible lmhs ( limiting mixed hodge structures ) for period maps @xmath9 into such a domain with given monodromy logarithm @xmath10 , and also admit a homogeneous description . a feature of that work was the interesting representation theory that arises from considering symmetries and asymptotics of hodge structures in tandem .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to better understand the interaction between asymptotic hodge theory and the @xmath6-orbit structure of the compact dual @xmath11 of @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is a parabolic subgroup , and @xmath14 a projective variety containing @xmath12 as an analytic open subset .",
    "the `` naive boundary strata '' of the title are the orbits in the topological boundary of @xmath12 in @xmath14 , and a natural question is which ones are hodge - theoretically `` accessible '' in the sense of containing a limit point of ( a lift @xmath15 of ) some period map @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to obtaining a nice answer to this question ( @xmath17 ) , we shall clarify the relationship of these `` boundary orbits '' to the boundary components , and obtain a mixed - hodge - theoretic parametrization of all the orbits and description of their incidence structure .",
    "now the traditional way to record the asymptotics of a period map @xmath16 is via the limiting mixed hodge structure , and not the `` naive '' limit point of @xmath15 in @xmath18 .",
    "there is a good reason for this : because of logarithmic growth of periods , the latter loses information recorded by the lmhs .",
    "one has the classic example ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of a degenerating family of genus-2 curves in two parameters , with two cycles vanishing at the origin . the degenerate fiber is a rational curve with two pairs of points identified , and the cross ratio of these 4 points is encoded in the extension data of the lmhs , while the `` naive '' limit and even the cohomology of the singular fiber record nothing . from an algebro - geometric point of view , then , it is unclear why one would want to study the interaction between variational hodge theory and the orbit structure of @xmath14 .",
    "our motivation for this work arose instead from a perspective heavily influenced by problems in complex geometry and representation theory , where the ( finitely many ) @xmath6-orbits are objects of some importance @xcite .",
    "recent work of robles @xcite has finally settled the question of maximal dimensions of integral manifolds of the infinitesimal period relation on @xmath14 ( and hence of images of period maps in @xmath19 ) .",
    "it seems that one way of producing interesting maximal - dimensional vhs is by threading integral manifolds through `` accessible '' orbits in @xmath18 , and that this approach holds some promise for the much - studied question of smoothing schubert varieties in @xmath14 in their cohomology classes .",
    "we also mention that in the forthcoming work @xcite , the proof of psuedo - convexity of @xmath12 will be recast in terms of our hodge - theoretic analysis of @xmath18 .    on the representation - theoretic side ,",
    "the @xmath6-orbits are related to the construction of infinite - dimensional unitary representations of @xmath20 via parabolic induction . moreover , one reason for writing @xcite was to see for which m - t domains one might extend h. carayol s approach @xcite to putting an arithmetic structure on automorphic cohomology .",
    "our analysis of codimension-1 boundary strata suggests ( cf .",
    "@xmath21 ) how to generalize his definition of fourier coefficients to at least some cases where @xmath4 is an exceptional group .",
    "we shall pursue these connections in future works .      in the remainder of the introduction",
    ", we briefly describe the main results . given a polarized hodge structure @xmath22 with mumford - tate group @xmath23 , let @xmath24 be the adjoint map , and set @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the cartan involution of @xmath4 induced by conjugation by @xmath28 .    for any @xmath29",
    ", if @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is a cocharacter of @xmath33 , whereupon it must clearly be trivial .",
    "so we have a diagram @xmath34 & { } ' g(\\rr)^{\\circ}/\\mathcal{h}_{{}'\\phi_0 } = : { } 'd \\ar [ d]^{\\cong } \\ar @{_(- > } [ l ]   \\\\ \\check{d}:= g(\\cc)/q_{f^{\\b}_{\\vf_0 } } & g(\\rr)^{\\circ}/\\mathcal{h}_{\\vf_0 } = : d \\ar @{_(- > } [ l ] } \\]]in which @xmath35 belongs to @xmath36 and the left - hand side is finite - to - one .",
    "but the parabolic subgroup @xmath37 is necessarily connected , and so in fact @xmath38 and @xmath14 are the same . for this reason , we may work without loss of generality in the adjoint setting .",
    "note that we view the points of the compact dual @xmath14 as flags on @xmath39 .",
    "we shall make the simplifying assumptions that the polarization on @xmath40 induced by @xmath41 is a multiple of the killing form @xmath42 , and that the horizontal distribution on @xmath14 ( equiv .",
    "@xmath38 ) is bracket - generating .    in (",
    "* ( iv.b.10 ) ) , it was conjectured that one should be able to parametrize @xmath14 via pairs @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a maximal algebraic torus and @xmath45 a complex co - character of @xmath46 , in @xmath6-equivariant fashion .",
    "this is proved in @xmath47 ( theorem [ thm surj ] ) , the take - away from which summarized in the following    \\(a ) given any point @xmath48 , there exists a pair @xmath43 as above such that @xmath49 _ _ ( _ _ cf .",

    "let @xmath61 be obtained from @xmath62 in the same manner , with stabilizers @xmath63 .",

    "bruhat order _ , and is generated ( at least in the complete flag setting ) by cayley transforms and cross actions in a sense made precise in @xcite .",
    "in @xmath68 it is briefly explained how to understand these processes in terms of `` naive '' limits of hodge flags and the framework of the corollary .    in the remainder of the paper , we are interested in those orbits incident to @xmath12 itself :    an orbit @xmath69 is called a _ naive boundary stratum_.    given a polarized variation of hodge structure @xmath16 over a punctured disk with monodromy logarithm @xmath10 , one can take the limit in two ways .",
    "the limiting flag @xmath70 associated to the lmhs is obtained by first twisting by @xmath71 and then taking the @xmath72 limit ; the _ naive limit _",
    "@xmath73 is the limit with no twist .",
    "they are related by the naive limit map @xmath74 defined and studied in @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , if a mhs @xmath76 is @xmath77-split , then @xmath78 is the flag obtained by flipping the associated bigrading about the antidiagonal ; moreover , @xmath79 factors the projection @xmath80 induced by passing to the @xmath5-splitting of the lmhs .",
    "as we described above , the instinctive question is how to determine whether a given naive boundary stratum @xmath81 contains a naive flag , or equivalently some @xmath82 . to this end , we introduce ( cf @xmath17 ) the following terminology :    * @xmath83 is _ rational _ if the filtration @xmath84 is @xmath6-conjugate to a @xmath5-rational one ; and * @xmath83 is _ polarizable _ if there exists a nonzero element @xmath85 such that @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and a positivity condition holds .",
    "two of our main general results ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm equiv]_ff _ ) may then be stated as follows :    a stratum @xmath83 contains a @xmath82 if and only if @xmath83 is rational and polarizable .",
    "all strata of codimension one are polarizable .    in @xmath88 , we work out for a variety of examples ( including the three @xmath2-domains of @xcite ) the complete incidence diagram and the associated bigradings for @xmath6-orbits , and determine which of the boundary strata are polarizable .",
