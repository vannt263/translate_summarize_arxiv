    "over the last years , the physics of extra dimensions aroused great interest with the publication of the seminal works of lisa randall and raman sundrum about warped geometry @xcite . in such works , our universe is supposed to be represented by a hypersurface ( brane ) immersed in a larger multidimensional space - time ( bulk ) . the main purpose of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) models is to provide a consistent response to the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem . despite the initial success",
    ", some difficulties involving the field localization and the divergences of geometrical quantities were observed @xcite . in order to remedy the difficulties arising in the rs models",
    "it has been proposed the use of solitons - like topological defects .",
    "such solutions are capable of providing an internal structure to the brane and thereby improve the field location mechanism and also to prevent singularities in the scalar curvature , in the schrdinger quantum analogue potential and in physical quantities of some other models @xcite",
    ". one of the advantages of this proposal is to provide a method for dynamically generating the brane through scalar field coupled to gravity in the presence of the @xmath0 potential .",
    "the solutions obtained in these scenarios give rise to different kinds of topological defects and enable the development of new and interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , the presence of resonant states resulting from the interaction of the fields with the potential responsible for generating the brane .",
    "several studies of field localization were carried out in thick braneworlds with an extra dimension .",
    "such studies were initially aimed to explain how the internal structure of the defects involving kink solutions obtained from the potential @xmath0 can interfere with localization of different fields on the brane @xcite . as an example",
    ", we can cite the bloch brane models generated by one or more scalar fields @xcite , in which the localization of tensorial and spinorial fields and the search for resonant states were the subject of several works @xcite .",
    "another way to get solitonic solutions is to consider potential of sine - gordon ( sg ) type to construct the brane model , as studied in refs .",
    "more recently , we consider the sine - gordon and the double sine - gordon ( dsg ) potentials in order to study the location of gravity .    new solutions for thick branes taking into account sg potential with broken symmetry @xmath1 was carried out in @xcite where the authors verify the stability and confinement effects for these braneworld models .",
    "however , the important issue about the field trapping and the existence of quasi - localized massive modes for the other fields present in the standard model have not been properly addressed in the context approached by us in ref .",
    "thus , in this paper we propose to analyse the localization of the vector field on the brane model generated by the potentials sg and dsg .",
    "the localization mechanism adopted by us and widely used in the literature consists of coupling directly into the five - dimensional lagrangian density the dilaton field with the usual maxwell kinetic term . in order to analyse the influence of massive vector modes in the coulomb law",
    ", we also perform the fermion field localization in the sg and the dsg branes .",

    "this work is outlined as follows : in section [ rev_sg_sce ] we introduce a braneworld generated by the sg potential and describe the localization of the vector field zero mode and massive spectrum . next , in section [ dil_bb ] , we include the dilaton field on the sg brane setup and reappraise the gauge field on this new scenario . in section [ mass_mode_dsg ]",
    "we introduce the dsg potential to the scalar field and obtain new results over the gauge field massive modes .",
    "further , in the section [ sec - coulmb ] , we compute the slight deviation in the coulomb law due these massive vector modes and due the massless fermion left mode .",

    "the effective action immediately tells us that the warp factor is absent and its exponential suppression effect no longer applies .",
    "the existence of a normalized solution that makes finite the effective action is ensured solely by the solutions of the equation of motion for the vector field in the extra dimension .",
    "for the zero mode with @xmath41 , a possible solution is @xmath42 , which implies a divergent effective action .",
    "thus , this particular solution does not allow the existence of a gauge field zero mode on this background .",

    "moreover , the zero mode of the equation ( [ eq : schgauge ] ) is not bound on the brane , as showed in figure ( [ sgg4_2 ] ) .",

    "the coupling of the massive modes with the matter on the brane is established in terms of the solution to the schrdinger - like equation at @xmath55 . the solutions to @xmath56",
    "acquire plane wave structure when @xmath57 because the potential represents only a small perturbation .",

    "the structure of the resulting potential ( [ eq : potz ] ) , which we show in fig . [ sgg3 ] suggests that there are no reverberations with the wave solutions .",
    "as we have noted , the potential tends to infinity with negative values , and the maximum values are also negative .",
    "in addition , we note that the potential does not have the usual volcano - like structure which has been obtained in thick brane models with localized zero modes as well as gauge field resonant modes .    in general , resonant mode are reverberations of the wave solutions near the bounce @xmath55 .",
    "these echoes are characterized by solutions to @xmath56 around @xmath55 with large amplitudes in comparison with its values far from the defect . to seek for such structures we adopt a largely used method based on the relative probability @xmath59 @xcite given by @xmath60 from the eq .",

    "the two solutions to the gauge field in the fifth dimension lead to divergent effective actions . analysing the massive modes we transform the gauge field equation in a schrdinger - like equation ,",
    "however , it can not be written in the form corresponding to supersymmetric quantum mechanics and we can not exclude the possibility of tachyonic states in the spectrum . the potential of the schrdinger - like equation does not have the usual volcano - like structure tending to infinity with negative values .",
    "such behaviour suggests that there are no resonant states to the gauge field for the sg setup .",
    "this suspect is confirmed when we evaluate the relative probability function in terms of the mass .",
    "some peaks were found on the evaluation of the @xmath59 function , however , the solutions of the equation of motion to the respective masses show us no reverberations to the wave solution in this scenario .    motivated by previous results in the literature concerning the gauge field localization , we have included the dilaton field in the sg scenario .",
    "the dilaton coupling does not changed the structure of the warp factor , but it allows the existence of a gauge field zero mode localized on the brane .",
    "better results were also found in the analysis of the massive modes .",
    "the resulting schrdinger - like equation excludes the existence of tachyonic states , and the corresponding potential presented a volcano - like structure indicating the possibility of having resonant states .",
    "the sg setup reveals us the existence of a resonant mode at @xmath98 .",
    "we observe clearly that the introduction of the dilaton field to the sg setup was essential to the localization of the zero mode and the appearance of reverberations .",
    "the peak presented in the density probability , the fig .",
    "[ sgg5 ] and the corresponding solution @xmath56 , show a massive mode with high probability to be found on the brane .",
    "furthermore , a new brane scenario generated by a double sine - gordon scalar field potential was introduced .",
    "the dsg potential revealed a new topology and resulted in a brane composed by two kinks with a splitting effect . in this new scenario , beyond the existence of a localized bound state",
    ", we have the presence of multiresonances .",
    "the schrdinger potential presents a structure that can be adjusted in terms of the dilaton coupling and the brane thickness , which could be appropriate to host resonant states .",
    "the results of the exploration of the massive spectrum reveal us that the dsg brane is compatible with the presence of multi quasi - localized massive states .",
    "finally , we verify how the massive gauge modes affect the coulomb potential in 4d for both sg and dsg scenarios .",
    "these corrections are very slight and exponentially suppressed for small distances in 4d , as expected . as higher",
    "the value of the dilaton parameter , more closed to the origin are placed these corrections .",
    "the suppression of these corrections in the sg scenario is comparatively larger than in the dsg for the same set of parameter values .",
