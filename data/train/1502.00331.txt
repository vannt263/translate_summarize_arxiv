    "supercooled liquids are characterized by collective dynamic fluctuations , known as dynamic heterogeneities , which occur over longer time- and length - scales as the glass transition temperature @xmath0 is approached . at the molecular scale , these fluctuations imply the correlated motion of an increasingly large number of molecules as relaxation slows down .",
    "to quantify dynamic heterogeneities , a general formalism based on multi - point dynamic correlations was developed over the last years  @xcite . in particular , the four - point dynamic susceptibility @xmath1 allows one to evaluate the amplitude of the dynamic fluctuations in numerical simulations  @xcite and , at the cost of some approximations , in experiments  @xcite .    despite these advances ,",
    "predicting the temperature evolution of dynamic heterogeneities remains a big challenge and none of the theories proposed so far is conclusive , as they describe experimental and numerical results equally well or poorly  @xcite . amongst them ,",
    "the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) is known to be a microscopic and first principles theory of the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "mct was initially formulated as a theory of caging in liquids and focused on two - point correlators .",
    "a recent generalization of mct to inhomogeneous systems ( imct ) enables one to evaluate multi - point correlation functions and make quantitative predictions for dynamic heterogeneities  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "both relaxation times and dynamic fluctuations diverge algebraically at the dynamic transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "these divergences are however `` avoided '' in real glass - formers : the dynamics at low temperature is instead governed by thermal activation , with a distinct super - arrhenius temperature dependence . in this regime ,",
    "dynamic heterogeneities are expected as a manifestation of cooperatively rearranging regions , or mosaics , as predicted by the classic adam - gibbs scenario  @xcite .",
    "the random first order transition theory ( rfot ) , which was originally inspired by mean - field models of spin glasses , integrates these two apparently distinct scenarios  @xcite .",
    "according to rfot , the dynamic transition predicted by mct corresponds to the trapping of the system in one of the basins of its rugged free energy landscape . in the mean - field limit , the dynamics is completely frozen - in at @xmath2 , whereas in finite dimensions the transition is rounded by thermal activation and becomes a mere crossover .",
    "seen from this perspective , the dynamic transition marks a change in the topology of the landscape ( also known as `` geometric transition ''  @xcite ) : above @xmath2 , the system mostly resides close to saddles , whereas below @xmath2 it is trapped close to local minima .",
    "the corresponding real space picture implies the existence of two distinct length scales characterizing dynamic heterogeneities : a dynamic one , which grows algebraically on approaching @xmath2 , and a static one corresponding , crudely speaking , to the size of the mosaics .    experimental data at ambient  @xcite and high pressure  @xcite , as well as recent simulation results  @xcite hint at a dynamic crossover at a temperature higher than @xmath0 .",
    "around the crossover , however , other physical mechanisms , such as dynamic facilitation  @xcite and/or local structure formation  @xcite , may play an important role and compete with the mean - field scenario .",
    "indeed , several predictions of the imct / mean - field framework remain so far undetected .",
    "first , the fitted power law exponents describing the growth of @xmath3 and the dynamic correlation length do not completely agree with the ones predicted by imct  @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to mct and imct , dynamic fluctuations grow near @xmath2 but the single - particle dynamics remains essentially gaussian .",
    "this counter - intuitive behavior is absent in standard glass - formers , for which @xmath3 and the non - gaussian parameter @xmath4 are typically correlated and grow concomitantly as the dynamics slows down  @xcite .",
    "finally , the saddles that become marginally stable at @xmath2 should be delocalized  @xcite , but no trace of such extended modes was detected in the potential energy surface of common glass - formers  @xcite .    in this paper , we put the mean - field scenario to a crucial test by studying the approach to the dynamic transition in the gaussian core model ( gcm )  @xcite .",
    "conventional model glass formers , such as lennard - jones and hard sphere fluids , are characterized by short - range , harshly repulsive potentials . in the gcm , instead , particles interact via an ultra - soft repulsive potential @xmath5  @xcite , whose _ tail _ plays a key role at high density . at sufficiently high density",
    ", the gcm becomes a good glass - former and its average dynamics is well described by mct  @xcite .",
    "simulations of the high - density gcm are computationally expensive , due to the large number of neighbors each particle is interacting with .",
    "therefore , characterizing dynamic fluctuations and the energy landscape of this model requires a major overhaul of the numerical protocol compared to previous studies  @xcite . by employing state - of - art molecular dynamics simulations on graphics processor units ( gpu ) ,",
    "we demonstrate that the gcm provides a striking incarnation of mean - field dynamic criticality in a three - dimensional system and provides a solid reference to understand how and when the mean - field scenario is washed out in more common glass - formers .",
    "we use molecular dynamics simulations in the nvt ensemble with a nose - hoover thermostat to study @xmath6 monodisperse gcm particles .",
    "the potential is cut and shifted and smoothed at @xmath7 with the xplor cutoff  @xcite , which ensures continuity of the force at the cutoff . for the energy landscape analysis",
    "we choose a smaller system ( @xmath8 ) . in the following ,",
    "we will use @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as units of the length , energy , and temperature , respectively .",
    "we focus on supercooled fluids along the isochore @xmath12 , for which the thermodynamically stable state is the bcc crystal ( for @xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "the crystallization kinetics is very slow and virtually negligible in our simulations  @xcite .",
    "we note that the density is much higher than @xmath14 , the re - entrant melting density of gcm  @xcite . in the low density limit",
    ", the gcm approaches asymptotyically the three - dimensional hard sphere model  @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the physics of model differs markedly from the one observed at high density . to ensure good statistics on the four - point dynamic susceptibility",
    ", we performed four independent production runs for each temperature and the simulation time for each trajectory was typically 100 times longer than the structural relaxation time @xmath15 ( see below ) .",
    "computer simulations of the gcm in the high density , supercooled regime are computationally demanding and require particular care . due to quasi - long range nature of the potential and the large statistics needed to evaluate @xmath3 , the simulation protocol must be efficient .",
    "moreover , in contrast to systems with harshly repulsive interactions , the force summation is not dominated by the first coordination shell and involves a large number of atoms .",
    "this , in turn , rises obvious issues of numerical accuracy . to tackle these issues ,",
    "we employed the hoomd simulation package  @xcite , a state - of - art molecular dynamics code running on graphic processor units ( gpu ) with double precision arithmetics . hoomd is currently one of the few simulation codes running entirely on gpu that allows double precision evaluation of _ both _ the forces and the integration step .",
    "we checked the results obtained with hoomd against those of in - house simulation codes running on cpu over the available temperature range and found them to be nicely consistent .",
    "an initial batch of simulations was performed using the rumd simulation package  @xcite .",
    "rumd implements the force calculation in single precision , which turns out to be insufficient for the gcm at high density .",
    "in fact , small but systematic differences between the simulations performed with rumd and with our in - house codes appeared at sufficiently low temperature , in both nve and nvt ensembles .",
    "these data sets were not retained in the analysis .",
    "the stationary points of the potential energy surface ( pes ) were located using standard numerical strategies adopted in earlier studies on lj mixtures  @xcite . to locate local minima and saddle points we minimized the total potential energy @xmath16 and the total force squared @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the norm of the force vector on particle @xmath19 respectively , using the lbfgs minimization algorithm  @xcite . for each studied temperature",
    ", we considered 80 independent configurations as starting points of our @xmath16- and @xmath20-minimizations .    due to the large system size and the long range cutoff , @xmath16- and @xmath20-minimizations for the gcm",
    "are technically more difficult than for lj mixtures .",
    "to reduce the computational burden without biasing the results , we used a smaller system size ( @xmath8 ) compared to the one used to characterize the dynamics ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath8 particle at @xmath12 the box length @xmath21 is only slightly larger than twice the cutoff distance .    due to softness of the potential and the large number of interacting particles ,",
    "minimizations require high numerical precision as well as a smooth cut - off scheme .",
    "thanks to the xplor cutoff , we could converge @xmath16-minimizations to values of the mean squared total force of order @xmath22 . for most of the configurations",
    "we located this way , the dynamical matrix contained no imaginary modes .",
    "@xmath16-minimizations that did not converge to true minima were therefore discarded from the analysis . the fraction of discarded configurations ranged from less than 10% ( close to @xmath2 ) to about 20% ( at the highest temperatures ) .",
    "we note however that inclusion of such spurious configurations does not alter the average inherent structure energy within statistical noise . to try to improve the convergence , we replaced the xplor cutoff by a smoother , cubic interpolation scheme  @xcite during the minimization .",
    "we found that the cubic splined cutoff did not improve appreciably the accuracy of the minimizations compared to the xplor cutoff .",
    "this indicates that the main numerical difficulty lies in the high dimensionality of the system , which makes the minimization problem ill - conditioned .",
    "@xmath20-minimizations are known to locate _ true _",
    "saddle points only rarely  @xcite .",
    "most of the points located through such a procedure are , in fact , _",
    "quasi_-saddles , i.e. local minima of @xmath20 with finite @xmath20 values .",
    "our minimization algorithm locates configurations with @xmath20 of the order @xmath23 , which is close to but still larger than the threshold we used for local minima ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we conclude that the points located by our @xmath20-minimizations should be considered as quasi - saddles .",
    "previous studies showed however that the statistical properties of quasi - saddles and true saddles are practically indistinguishable  @xcite . on this basis",

    "the data are plotted against the reduced temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the mode - coupling temperature @xmath2 was determined following the standard fitting procedure : we fixed the exponent @xmath29 , obtained by solving the mct equation for the gcm , and then determined @xmath2 by linear regression of @xmath44 against @xmath45 in the range @xmath46 .",
    "the so obtained value of @xmath47 is only 20% smaller than the theoretical prediction ( @xmath48 ) , which should be contrasted with more than 100% for the kob - andersen lennard - jones ( ka ) mixture  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the mct power - law fit works for a wider range of @xmath49 , viz . down to @xmath50 , than in the ka mixture , for which deviations are already apparent around @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the new simulations allow us to detect a slight discrepancy between the exponents that fit the relaxation times ( @xmath29 ) and the inverse diffusion constants ( @xmath31 ) . in the latter case",
    ", we fixed the critical temperature @xmath2 to the one obtained from the relaxation times analysis and only adjusted the power law amplitude and exponent .",
    "these minor deviations from mct predictions should be contrasted to those found in other models , which are typically around 2025% .",
    "we note that the small discrepancy between @xmath52 and @xmath53 observed in the gcm could be explained even within the framework of the mct itself , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to characterize dynamic heterogeneities in the gcm , we consider two different observables .",
    "first , we evaluate the non - gaussian parameter @xmath54 , which quantifies how much the particles displacements deviates from a gaussian distribution . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot @xmath55 for the ka mixture and the gcm for similar relaxation time windows .",
    "@xmath55 of the ka mixture grows rapidly as the temperature is decreased whereas the growth of @xmath55 of the gcm is moderate .",
    "this observation is consistent with the shape of the van hove functions @xmath56 near @xmath57 .",

    ", the distribution functions remains unimodal even at the lowest investigated temperature .",
    "the absence of hopping - like motion in the gcm is consistent with our analysis of the potential energy landscape ( see below ) which indicates that thermally activated relaxation is strongly suppressed .",
    "we conclude that the distribution of single - particle mobility in the gcm is homogeneous , even when the slow dynamics is well developed .",
    "the shape of @xmath60 of the ka mixture is bimodal , indicating coexistence of highly mobile and immobile particles  @xcite , while that of the gcm remains unimodal even at the lowest temperature .",

    "[ fig1 ] : @xmath1 grows far more strongly in the gcm than in the ka mixture . around @xmath2 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath1 , called herein @xmath67 , in the gcm is one order of magnitude larger than that of the ka mixture .",
    "note that while the dynamic susceptibility depends in general on the statistical ensemble , this result holds also in the ensemble where all global variables are allowed to fluctuate ( see appendix ) .",
    "thus dynamic fluctuations in the gcm are significantly larger than those in other standard models around @xmath2",
    ".    the opposite trends of @xmath55 and @xmath1 may look contradicting at a first glance .",
    "this implies that the nature of dynamic heterogeneities of the gcm is qualitatively different from other conventional glass formers .",
    "large values of @xmath55 are a direct consequence of the large displacements of individual mobile particles and do not necessarily reflect the extent of cooperative motion . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath1 is defined as the variance of the overlap function , which does not depend on how far the mobile particles have moved , and it is thus more sensitive to the net cooperativity .",
    "therefore , the suppression of @xmath55 and the concomitant enhancement of @xmath1 in the gcm imply _ slight but spatially extended modulations of the mobility field_.        these inferences are confirmed by visual inspection of the mobility field close to the dynamical critical temperature . to visulalize the giant dynamic fluctuations that give rise to the increase of @xmath3 close to the dynamic transition",
    ", we evaluate the mobility of the particles after time @xmath34 as @xmath68 . in figure",
    "[ si : snap ] we show typical snapshots of the mobility field at @xmath69 , close to the dynamic transition . at this temperature , the maximum of the dynamic susceptibility has reached about 200 .",
    "the radii of the spheres are proportional to the particles displacements after a time @xmath70 .",
    "we clearly see that the mobility field is characterized by extended regions of either mobile or immobile particles , with very smooth variations over space .",
    "note that no coarse - graining or time averaging is involved in our calculation of @xmath71 .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the correlation length is comparable to the system size at this temperature .",
    "this is in turn compatible with the existence of finite size effects around and below this temperature .",
    "the coexistence of giant dynamic heterogeneities and gaussian - like dynamics is a strong evidence of mean - field dynamic criticality .",
    "according to mct and imct , the amplitude of @xmath55 remain small  @xcite , whereas @xmath72 diverges on approaching @xmath2 with an exponent that depends on both microscopic dynamics and statistical ensemble  @xcite . for molecular dynamics simulations in the nvt ensemble ,",
    "the susceptibility is predicted to diverge as @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath49 .",
    "the data for the ka mixture are not well described by imct , whereas for the gcm @xmath74 follows the power law predicted by the theory over the range of temperature @xmath75 .",
    "we emphasize that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the critical temperatures @xmath2 are those obtained by fitting the relaxation times data .",
    "our data demonstrate that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath67 can be fitted by power laws over comparable @xmath49 ranges and using the appropriate set of mct exponents .",
    "deviations from the imct prediction are observed only at the lowest temperature in fig .",
    "this deviation is most likely due to finite size effects , which will naturally appear if @xmath1 has a genuine divergence , rather than to the crossover between mct and activated regimes . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the histogram of the overlap @xmath76 for the gcm at @xmath57 . by definition ,",
    "the mean value of the histogram is @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , the histogram at @xmath59 is unimodal with the mean value of @xmath78 , whereas it becomes very broad at @xmath40 , suggesting that a correlation length becomes comparable to the system size .",
    "we note that such strong finite size effects were not observed in the ka mixture  @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the dynamics of the gcm from the perspective of the energy landscape  @xcite . according to the rfot scenario ,",
    "the mct crossover should be accompanied by a `` geometric '' transition in the energy landscape  @xcite : in mean - field , the unstable modes separating the free energy minima become marginally stable as @xmath2 is approached and eventually disappear below a certain threshold energy  @xcite . in finite dimensions , remnants of this geometrical transition should be visible in the potential energy landscape around the mct crossover : above @xmath2 the system relaxes mostly via unstable soft modes , while activated relaxation over energy barriers takes over below @xmath2 .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes takes place at an energy threshold @xmath79 , below which the system resides mostly close to local minima of the potential energy instead of stationary points of arbitrary order .",
    "early numerical simulations of the ka mixture gave support to this scenario and found a crossover temperature @xmath80 very close to @xmath2  @xcite , but were later on called into question  @xcite .",
    "to determine the statistics of stationary points , we located minima and saddles by applying the lbfgs minimization algorithm to the total potential energy @xmath16 and to the total force @xmath20 respectively  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "although local minima of @xmath20 do not necessarily correspond to true stationary points  @xcite , @xmath20-minimizations yield a fairly robust measurement of the energy threshold @xmath79 and of the typical energy barriers  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the saddle point energy , @xmath81 , as obtained from @xmath20-minimizations , against the fraction of unstable modes @xmath82 found in the spectrum of the dynamical matrix . out .",
    "see  @xcite . ] as in other models , these two quantifies are roughly linearly related . from a linear fit @xmath83",
    "we extract the threshold energy @xmath84 . comparing this with the temperature dependence of the energy of minima @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) ) , we obtain a threshold temperature @xmath86 in excellent agreement with @xmath2 .",
    "the slope @xmath87 gives an estimate of the average barrier height , since it is the energy cost to increase by one the order of a stationary point  @xcite .",
    "we found @xmath88 in the gcm , which is appreciably larger @xmath89 observed in other model glass formers  @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the increased barrier height hampers the activated relaxation by a factor @xmath90 .",
    "as the activated relaxation channels are strongly suppressed , the mct - like critical behavior dominates the slow dynamics of the model  @xcite .",
    "further support for the geometric transition scenario is provided by the analysis of the mode localization .",
    "it has been argued that the unstable directions that disappear at the dynamic transition are _ delocalized _ in the mean - field scenario  @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the typical observation that unstable modes of common glass - formers become increasingly localized as @xmath45 decreases  @xcite . to evaluate the spatial localization of the unstable modes",
    ", we calculate their participation ratio @xmath91 on a per - mode basis @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the displacement of particle @xmath19 along the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenfrequency @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) we plot the distribution of the participation ratio of unstable modes around @xmath2 . as in various conventional glass formers  @xcite , the unstable modes of the ka mixture have small participation ratios and are therefore spatially localized .",
    "by contrast , the distribution is broader in the gcm and considerably shifted towards larger value of @xmath91 ( @xmath95 for plane waves , 1 for completely delocalized modes ) .",
    "visual inspection suggests that these modes have a complex spatial structure , in which some groups of particles undergo cooperative motions , while others display incoherent displacements .",
    "while determining the precise nature of the modes in the gcm would    while determining the precise nature of the modes in the gcm would require an analysis of @xmath96-dependence of the spectrum , and thus of the mobility edge  @xcite , our analysis suggests that the giant dynamic heterogeneities of the gcm might indeed be associated to these extended unstable modes . in the ka mixture , instead",
    ", dynamic heterogeneities build up through dynamic facilitation of localized elementary rearrangements  @xcite , which might be related to modes localized outside locally stable domains  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we presented evidence that the mean - field scenario predicting diverging dynamic fluctuations and a geometric transition close to the dynamic transition can be observed in a three - dimensional model system at sufficiently high density .",
    "our results shed new light on the physical nature of dynamic heterogeneities predicted by imct .",
    "the approach to the dynamic transition is accompanied by rapidly growing dynamic correlations and by the disappearance of extended unstable modes of the potential energy landscape .",
    "we identify a clear fingerprint of mean - field dynamic criticality , that is , the coexistence of the strong dynamic fluctuations and nearly gaussian distribution of a single particle displacement . which finite - dimensional features ( e.g. locally preferred structures , dynamic facilitation ) mask the mean - field physics in actual supercooled liquids is a question that need to be addressed in future studies .",
