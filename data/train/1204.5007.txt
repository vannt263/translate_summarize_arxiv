    "the study of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) surfaces in spaces of constant curvature ( that is , @xmath0 , the sphere @xmath1 , and hyperbolic space @xmath2 ) , is one of the oldest subjects in differential geometry .",
    "there are many beautiful results on this topic ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and many others ) .",
    "the simplest examples of cmc surfaces in @xmath1 are the totally umbilic 2-spheres .",
    "another basic example is the so - called clifford torus @xmath3 . identifying @xmath1 with the unit sphere in @xmath4 ,",
    "the clifford torus @xmath5 is defined for @xmath6 by @xmath7    by constructing a holomorphic quadratic differential for cmc surfaces , h. hopf showed that any cmc two - sphere in @xmath8 is totally umbilical ( see @xcite ) .",
    "s.  s.  chern extended hopf s result to cmc two - spheres in @xmath9-dimensional space forms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "h.  c.  wente was the first ( see @xcite ) to show the existence of compact immersed cmc tori in @xmath10 .",
    "examples solved the long standing problem of hopf ( see @xcite ) : is a compact cmc surface in @xmath10 necessarily a round sphere ?",
    "a. d. alexandrov ( see @xcite ) showed that if a compact cmc surface is embedded in @xmath8 , @xmath2 or a hemisphere @xmath11 , then it must be totally umbilical .",
    "wente s paper was followed by a series of papers ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and many others ) , where wente tori were investigated in detail and other examples of cmc tori were constructed . in particular a. i. bobenko ( @xcite ) constructed cmc tori in @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in principle , the construction in @xcite gives rise to all cmc tori in @xmath1 , but reading off properties such as embeddedness from this classification is difficult .",
    "it remains an interesting unsolved problem to classify all embedded cmc tori in @xmath1 .",
    "it is explicitly conjectured by pinkall and sterling @xcite*p.250 that such surfaces are surfaces of revolution , and our main result confirms this .",
    "we then give a complete classification of such embedded tori by completing a classification of rotationally symmetric cmc surfaces by perdomo @xcite .",
    "our result is as follows :    [ main.theorem ]    1 .",
    "[ item : symmetry ] every embedded cmc torus @xmath12 in @xmath1 is a surface of rotation : there exists a two - dimensional subspace @xmath13 of @xmath14 such that @xmath12 is invariant under the group @xmath15 of rotations fixing @xmath13 .",
    "[ item : discretesymm ] if @xmath12 is an embedded cmc torus which is not congruent to a clifford torus , then there exists a maximal integer @xmath16 such that @xmath12 has @xmath17-fold symmetry : precisely , @xmath12 is invariant under the group @xmath18 generated by the rotation which fixes the orthogonal plane @xmath19 and rotates @xmath13 through angle @xmath20 .",
    "[ item : uniqueness ] for given @xmath16 , there exists at most one such cmc torus ( up to congruence ) .",
    "[ item : existence ] for given @xmath16 , there exists an embedded cmc torus with mean curvature @xmath21 and maximal symmetry @xmath22 if @xmath23 lies strictly between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "[ item : rigidity ] if @xmath26 then every embedded torus with mean curvature @xmath21 is congruent to the clifford torus .",
    "our contributions are items [ item : symmetry ] and [ item : uniqueness ] . given these",
    ", the remaining results follow from @xcite . the case @xmath27 of item [ item : rigidity ]",
    "is the lawson conjecture proved recently by brendle @xcite .",
    "the rigidity appearing for @xmath28 is unexpected , however .",
    "we note that the embeddedness assumption in theorem [ main.theorem ] is crucial : bobenko @xcite has constructed an infinite family of non - rotationally symmetric immersed cmc tori in @xmath1 ( see also brito - leite @xcite , wei - cheng - li @xcite , perdomo @xcite ) .",
    "recently the first author proved in @xcite a non - collapsing result for mean - convex hypersurfaces in euclidean space evolving by mean curvature flow .",
    "the estimate was inspired by earlier work of weimin sheng and xujia wang @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who in the course of a detailed analysis of singularity profiles in mean curvature flow proved that for any embedded compact mean - convex hypersurface @xmath29 moving under the mean curvature flow , there is a positive constant @xmath30 such that at every point @xmath31 of @xmath29 there is a sphere of radius @xmath32 enclosed by @xmath29 which touches @xmath29 at @xmath31 .",
    "the main contribution of @xcite was a very direct proof of this non - collapsing result using a maximum principle argument .",
    "in particular , the noncollapsing condition described in the last paragraph was expressed as the positivity of a certain function of pairs of points on the hypersurface , and this function was shown to admit a maximum principle argument to preserve initial positivity .",
    "we will discuss this expression for noncollapsing in section [ sec : touching - spheres ] .",
    "the idea of working with functions of pairs of points was in turn inspired by earlier work of huisken @xcite and hamilton @xcite for the curve shortening flow and for ricci flow on surfaces .    in @xcite this technique",
    "was adapted to a family of other flows , and it was shown that the mean curvature used to determine the scale of noncollapsing can be replaced by any function satisfying a certain differential inequality related to the linearisation of the evolution equation .",
    "recently , brendle @xcite made a remarkable breakthrough : he reworked the technique of @xcite in such a way that it can be applied to minimal surfaces , and succeeded in proving the lawson conjecture , that the only embedded minimal torus in @xmath1 is the clifford torus .",
    "brendle used the same ` non - collapsing ' quantity as in @xcite ( we describe the geometric meaning of this below in section [ sec : touching - spheres ] ) , but exploited the additional special structure coming from the minimal surface condition to show that the maximum principle argument still works if the radii of the touching spheres are compared to the length of the second fundamental form rather than the mean curvature .    in this paper",
    ", we again use the non - collapsing argument originating from @xcite , together with the modifications introduced by brendle .",
    "a crucial point is to choose carefully the scale on which to compare the touching spheres : we show in section [ sec : mp ] that the difference of the curvatures of the touching spheres from the mean curvature @xmath21 of @xmath12 can be compared in ratio with the difference of the largest principal curvature from @xmath21 using a maximum principle argument .",
    "this implies ( as in brendle s case ) that every point of the surface @xmath12 is touched by a ball with boundary curvature equal to the maximum principal curvature at that point .    in brendle s",
    "argument in @xcite one can touch by such spheres on both sides of the surface , and deduce from this that the second fundamental form is parallel , from which the rigidity follows easily . in our case",
    "this is no longer true , and we can only deduce that some components of the derivative of second fundamental form vanish .",
    "however this is enough to conclude ( as we do in section [ sec : symmetry ] ) that the surface is rotationally symmetric .",
    "perdomo @xcite has given an analysis of rotationally symmetric surfaces with constant mean curvature in @xmath1 : these are constructed from the solutions of a certain differential equation , which are parametrized by a parameter @xmath33 for each @xmath21 .",
    "embedded examples arise from those solutions for which an associated ` period ' function @xmath34 equals @xmath20 for some positive integer @xmath17 .",
    "perdomo showed that as @xmath33 varies the family of cmc surfaces deforms from the clifford torus to a chain of ` kissing spheres ' , and found the limiting values of @xmath34 .",
    "our second contribution in this paper is to complete the classification by proving that @xmath34 is monotone in @xmath33 , and so takes each value between the limits found by perdomo exactly once .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank professor s. -t .",
    "yau and professor r.  schoen for their interest in this topic .",
    "we also express our thanks to graduate student mr .",
    "zhijie huang for assistance with checking the proof of monotonicity of @xmath34 ( see proposition [ prop : monotonic ] ) .",
    "the key geometric idea in the non - collapsing argument from @xcite is to compare the curvature of enclosed balls touching the surface to a suitable function ( mean curvature in the setting of @xcite ) at the touching point .",
    "we recall here some of the expressions which arise from this picture ( see also the discussion in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be an embedded hypersurface in @xmath36 given by an embedding @xmath37 , and bounding a region @xmath38 .",
    "we choose @xmath39 in such a way that the unit normal @xmath40 of @xmath12 points out of @xmath39 . for given @xmath41 we will derive an inequality which is equivalent to the geometric statement that there is a ball in @xmath39 of boundary curvature @xmath42 which touches at @xmath43 .",
    "a geodesic ball in @xmath44 is simply the intersection of a ball in @xmath45 with @xmath44 .",
    "in particular the ball in @xmath44 with boundary curvature @xmath42 which is tangent to @xmath46 at the point @xmath43 is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and @xmath40 is the unit normal to @xmath46 at @xmath43 in @xmath44 which points out of @xmath39 .",
    "the statement that this ball lies entirely in @xmath39 is equivalent to the statement that no other points of @xmath46 are inside @xmath49 .",
    "this is in turn equivalent to the statement that for any @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which can be written as follows : @xmath52 ) this becomes @xmath53 since @xmath54 we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 in summary we have the following :    [ prop : balls ] if @xmath58 is a smooth positive function , then the function @xmath59 is non - negative for every @xmath60 if and only if at every point @xmath41 there is a ball @xmath61 with boundary curvature @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "following @xcite we call the smallest @xmath62 for which this is true the _ interior ball curvature _ of the surface at @xmath31 , and denote it by @xmath64 .",
    "since a ball of curvature less than the largest principal curvature can not touch at @xmath31 , we always have @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the largest principal curvature of the surface at @xmath31 .",
    "the main result of section [ sec : mp ] is that an embedded cmc torus in @xmath1 always has interior ball curvature equal to the maximum principal curvature at every point .",
    "the key result of @xcite is that an embedded minimal torus in @xmath1 always has interior ball curvature equal to the maximum principal curvature and exterior ball curvature equal to minus the minimum principal curvature .",
    "let @xmath67 be an embedded torus in @xmath68 with constant mean curvature @xmath21 ( note that we adopt the convention that @xmath21 is the average of the two principal curvatures , not their sum ) . by choosing the direction of the unit normal we can assume @xmath69 .",
    "our aim in this section is to prove that the interior ball curvature equals the maximum principal curvature , by deriving a contradiction if this is not the case .",
    "let @xmath42 be a function on @xmath12 with @xmath70 . in the following we fix @xmath42 and denote for brevity @xmath71 ( see equation ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 for all @xmath73 ( so that by proposition [ prop : balls ] there is a ball with boundary curvature @xmath62 touching at each point @xmath43 of the surface ) , and consider a pair of points @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath76 is a minimum point of @xmath77 and the differential of @xmath77 at the point @xmath76 vanishes .",
    "we begin by elaborating the geometric picture : by proposition [ prop : balls ] , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 lie on the boundary of the ball @xmath49 in @xmath1 of boundary curvature @xmath80 , which is the intersection with @xmath1 of the ball of radius @xmath81 in @xmath14 centred at the point @xmath82 .",
    "thus @xmath83 , so by construction @xmath46 lies in the exterior of @xmath49 and touches at the points @xmath84 and @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that the tangent spaces of the surface @xmath46 at these points agree with those of the two - dimensional sphere @xmath85 , and the outward unit normals @xmath86 and @xmath87 agree with those of the sphere also .",
    "let @xmath88 .",
    "then the symmetry of the sphere implies that the reflection @xmath89 maps the tangent space to @xmath46 at @xmath90 to that at @xmath91 , and that @xmath92 where we used the equation @xmath75 in the last step .",
    "let @xmath93 be geodesic normal coordinates around @xmath90 , and let @xmath94 be geodesic normal coordinates around @xmath91 .",
    "we specify further that the tangent vectors @xmath95 diagonalize the second fundamental form , so that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "we use the following notations : @xmath100 we also assume that the coordinate tangent vectors at @xmath91 are defined by reflecting those at @xmath90 : @xmath101    the key computation is the following :    [ prop : d2z ] if @xmath102 for all @xmath103 , then at the point @xmath76 we have @xmath104    we first compute the derivatives of @xmath77 : @xmath105 in particular this vanishes at the point @xmath76 , so we have @xmath106 now we begin computing @xmath107 : differentiating the expression in the direction @xmath108 we obtain the following : @xmath109 differentiating again and taking a sum over @xmath103 , we obtain the following : @xmath110 where we used the codazzi identity to write @xmath111 . the choice and the identity imply that at @xmath76 we have @xmath112 the constant mean curvature condition gives @xmath113 , and we also use the identities @xmath114 and @xmath115 and equations and to obtain the following by evaluating at @xmath76 : @xmath116 the result follows directly .",
    "[ key.ingredient ] at the point @xmath76 we have @xmath117    we have @xmath118 .",
    "now we can prove the main result of this section :    [ thm : mp ] suppose that @xmath67 is an embedded torus with constant mean curvature @xmath69 in @xmath1 .",
    "then the interior ball curvature @xmath119 of @xmath46 is equal to the maximum principal curvature @xmath120 at every point .",
    "the case @xmath27 was proved in @xcite , so we assume that @xmath121 .",
    "we will apply the maximum principle using the formula in proposition [ key.ingredient ] , with @xmath42 chosen as follows : we denote by @xmath122 the largest principal curvature at @xmath31 , and by @xmath123 the difference @xmath124 .",
    "then we choose @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a positive constant .",
    "we require the following variant of simons identity :    [ simons.identity ] suppose that @xmath67 is an embedded cmc torus in @xmath1 .",
    "then the function @xmath127 is strictly positive and satisfies the partial differential equation @xmath128    note that @xmath129 , so @xmath127 vanishes only at umbilical points .",

    "in this case @xmath358 takes values for @xmath359 in the range @xmath360 thus there exists no integer @xmath16 such that @xmath361 , and consequently there are no compact embedded torus in @xmath1 with @xmath357 , other than the clifford torus .",
    "this rigidity was previously unknown even in the rotationally symmetric case , though it is suggested by the results of perdomo @xcite and ripoll @xcite .",
    "for all other values of @xmath21 there exists some @xmath17 such that equation holds for some @xmath33 , and consequently there always exist embedded cmc tori which are not congruent to clifford tori .",
    "the number of these ( up to congruence ) is precisely the number of values of @xmath17 for which holds ."
