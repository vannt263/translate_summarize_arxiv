    "one now has a fairly good understanding of how to produce entanglement among microscopic systems , such as atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , or artificial qubits @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been considerable interest in studying macroscopic entanglement in the context of cavity optomechanics @xcite , where the great experimental advance has made it possible to study the quantum effects and the preparation of nonclassical states for the optomechanical systems , including the realization of the squeezed light @xcite , squeezed mechanical resonator @xcite , macroscopic superposition state @xcite , and mechanical entanglement @xcite .",
    "macroscopic entanglement of mechanical resonators plays a key role in testing the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , quantum information processing , and ultrahigh - precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the generation of stationary entanglement with two or several mechanical objects in an optical cavity has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "very recently , the coupling scheme between two cascaded optomechanical setups has also been proposed .",
    "the quantum entanglement between two macroscopic mechanical resonators can be generated with the systems being connected by an optical fiber or direct photon tunneling @xcite , but the mechanical entanglement is small and limited to the enviromental bath of low temperature .",
    "chen et al . have found that the entanglement can be enhanced by using a periodically modulated pump laser @xcite , where the chirped frequency needs to be subtlely controlled and is therefore sensitive to fluctuation of experimental parameters . further increasing",
    "the mechanical entanglement may require the strong single - photon coupling , and the mechanical resonators should be firstly cooled down to the quantum ground state @xcite .",
    "recent studies have found that including an optical parametric amplifier inside a cavity could affect the normal - mode splitting behavior between the coupled movable mirror and the cavity field @xcite and significantly enhance the optomechanical effective coupling @xcite .",
    "moreover , squeezing of cavity modes can considerably improve the cooling of the micromechanical mirror @xcite and the squeezing properties can be transferred from photons to phonons with high efficiency @xcite . here",
    ", we propose a scheme to enhance the mechanical stationary entanglement for two distant movable mirrors by placing two opas inside two coupled optomechanical cavities .",
    "the cavity fields are coupled through a photon - hopping interaction .",
    "it is shown that the limits for the stability condition for the coupled optomechanical system can be relaxed by controlling the parametric gain , and therefore , the stable region of the corresponding parameter space expands .",
    "the enhancement of mechanical entanglement can be achieved by appropriately tuning the parametric gain and the effective laser - cavity detuning , and is even more pronounced with laser blue - detuning from cavity resonance .",
    "in addition , since the difficulty of preserving quantum entanglement of macroscopic systems is often attributed to environment - induced decoherence , we also show that the opas inside the cavities can help to witness the steady - state entanglement between the mechanical resonators suffered from certain thermal noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the setup with two coupled cavity optomechanical systems and build the corresponding theoretical model . in section iii , we give the covariance matrix for the system and use it to calculate the logarithmic negativity , which quantifies the steady - state mechanical entanglement . in section iv , we present the effect of the opas on the generated mechanical entanglement by numerical simulation .",
