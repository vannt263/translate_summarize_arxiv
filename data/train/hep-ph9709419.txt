    "actually in this case it is possible to calculate the correlator to all orders in the fine structure constant as a function of the qed @xmath8-function .",
    "it is of clear interest for applications in non - abelian gauge theories to also have control over the radiative corrections in the regime where perturbation theory is applicable .",

    "results for the field strength correlator up to next - to - leading order in perturbative qcd will be presented and some details of the calculation are discussed .",
    "an alternative derivation of the correlator from a hybrid quark gluon current in the framework of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is given in section 3 . in section 4 , we make a brief comparison of our results with recent determinations of the field strength correlator on the lattice @xcite and summarise our work .",

    "this finding entails that the @xmath39 correction to the field strength correlator is large and that for phenomenological applications further understanding of this large correction should be achieved .",

    "a great advantage of this representation of the field strength correlator is the fact that for its perturbative evaluation we only have to deal with local operators .",

    "@xcite is therefore difficult and a quantitative analysis would require a similar calculation of @xmath51 in lattice perturbation theory to establish the relation between the two schemes .",
    "it is to be expected that the scheme dependence goes beyond merely replacing @xmath52 by the lattice coupling constant and that there should be additional constant terms .",
    "nevertheless , we shall attempt to present some qualitative observations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the pure qcd correlator has been measured for four values of @xmath53 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it was found that an acceptable fit to @xmath50 can be obtained by a pure perturbative @xmath56 behaviour . dividing out @xmath57 with an average value @xmath58",

    "surprisingly , on the lattice @xmath49 was found to be larger than @xmath50 .",
    "hopefully , a perturbative calculation in the lattice regularisation scheme will clarify these issues in the future .    in qed",
    "the gauge string exponential is absent and higher order corrections are only due to the renormalization of the electric charge .",
    "vainshtein and zakharov calculated the quantity @xmath61 in terms of the qed @xmath8-function @xcite .",
    "however , the leading term for @xmath61 in qed starts at order @xmath62 .",

    "we have presented a calculation of the gauge invariant field strength correlator at the next - to - leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "it was found that the correlator depends on both the renormalization scale as well as the renormalization scheme .",
    "constructing a scale independent quantity at this order , it turned out that the first order correction is large , namely roughly 50% to 100% for distances of @xmath63 to @xmath35 . because of the scheme dependence of the field strength correlator , for a sound comparison with recent lattice data , an analogous calculation of the correlator in lattice perturbation theory would be required .",
