    "<S> but , to our knowledge , the only rigorous results ( i.e. with a proof of convergence of the series ) can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used relatively elementary tools from the analysis of pde s and , in particular , we do not rely on the modern theory for wave and schrdinger equations ( strichartz estimates , klainerman bilinear estimates , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> many improvements in these directions could be provided , although they may not be straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> also we are not able to apply our theory the kdv equation , since its nonlinearity can not be controlled by our methods . </S>",
    "<S> another question concerns the extension of our results to an infinite time interval and to relate together the asymptotic data for @xmath86 and @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> one may indeed ask whether the limits @xmath88 exist and , if so , if for @xmath55 , @xmath89 such identities ( and their analogues by exchanging @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) would imply in particular that the scattering map @xmath92 and the wave operators @xmath93 are well - defined and real analytic and @xmath94 map @xmath95 to itself . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from most references where the scattering map reads in our notations @xmath96 and the wave maps are @xmath97 ( see paragraph [ paragraph2.2 ] for the definition of @xmath98 ) . ] . in the light of results in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this should be true for the equation @xmath99 on @xmath100 and for @xmath101 , due to dispersive effects ( strichartz estimates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key point in all these works is an estimate of the type @xmath102 , which , e.g. , holds for a solution @xmath1 of @xmath99 with finite energy . </S>",
    "<S> + _ acknowledgements _  i wish to thank isabelle gallagher for explanations about paraproducts . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a extended and improved version of an earlier work in collaboration with dikanaina harrivel @xcite . </S>"
