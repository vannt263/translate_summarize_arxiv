    "the unknowns in problem are the supersonic flow @xmath20 and the free boundary @xmath21 , which is a lipschitz curve passing through the origin .",
    "the free boundary is actually a transonic characteristic discontinuity ( vortex sheet and/or entropy wave ) separating the supersonic flow @xmath22 from the unperturbed static gas @xmath23 that is subsonic ( cf .",

    ", we employ the special structure of the euler equations of the two - dimensional steady flows , and introduce the lagrangian coordinates @xmath36 associated to a solution , as done in the study of transonic shocks @xcite , to transform the free boundary to the positive @xmath37-axis , so that the solutions @xmath22 and @xmath30 are then defined in the same domain @xmath38 in lagrangian coordinates .",

    "in section 5 , we show the uniqueness of solutions to problem in the larger class of viscosity solutions . by wagner s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) , there is a one - to - one correspondence between a bounded measurable weak solution of a hyperbolic system of conservation laws and a bounded measurable weak solution of the corresponding equations in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "thus , the uniqueness results established for problem imply the uniqueness of transonic characteristic discontinuities in eulerian coordinates .",
    "this is clarified in section 6 .",
    "the well - posedness results are summarized in theorem [ thmmain ] .",
    "these results on the existence , uniqueness , and @xmath0stability in lagrangian coordinates , together with the existence theorem established in @xcite , may be considered as a complete mathematical well - posedness theory of such transonic characteristic discontinuity solutions .",
    "in this section we reformulate the problem in eulerian coordinates to the problem in lagrangian coordinates and show the existence of entropy solutions for the problem in lagrangian coordinates .      for a piecewise @xmath48 smooth flow",

    "let @xmath49 and @xmath50 be a _",

    "since the domain @xmath55 is simply connected , by the conservation of mass , as well as the rankine - hugoniot ( r - h ) conditions for crossing the shock - front , @xmath56 is a well - defined function of @xmath54 with @xmath57 , independent of the choice of @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath58 we also note that , by the last condition in , @xmath56 is independent of @xmath52 on @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath52 and @xmath59 on the characteristic discontinuity , we have @xmath60 since the characteristic discontinuity @xmath61 is in @xmath62 , it is differentiable almost everywhere , so that the integrand is discontinuous only at these points in a set of lebesgue measure zero , which is harmless for the above calculation . hence , in the following , we may write @xmath63 with @xmath47 whenever @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 , and @xmath3 belong to @xmath66 , and is satisfied in the sense of distributions , we can also find a unique lipschitz continuous function @xmath56 so that @xmath67 and holds . as a matter of fact , using standard mollification , we may approximate @xmath68 and @xmath69 in weak convergence of distributions by @xmath70 functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for which the equality @xmath73 still holds . furthermore , by the young inequality , we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "the uniqueness follows from the well - known fact that a distribution with zero derivatives must be a constant . differentiating @xmath56 along a streamline ( which is lipschitz continuous ) and using yield that it is constant along the stream line",
    "now we introduce the following lagrangian transformation @xmath83 : @xmath84 then we have @xmath85 thus @xmath86 this transform is lipschitz continuous and one - to - one provided @xmath87 .",
    "a simple computation shows that equations  may be written in divergence form : @xmath88 or , as a symmetric system for @xmath89 , @xmath90 with @xmath91 for @xmath92 , the conservation law of energy becomes @xmath93 , that is , @xmath94 this is the well - known bernoulli law . as @xmath95 is given by the initial data , in the following we focus on system with @xmath3 determined by @xmath96 through .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath97 of ( i.e. @xmath98 ) are @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mach number of the flow .",

    "the associated right - eigenvectors are @xmath102 where @xmath103 can be chosen that @xmath104 , since the @xmath105th - characteristics fields , @xmath106 , are genuinely nonlinear .",
    "note that the second characteristic field is always linearly degenerate : @xmath107 .      as we noted",
    "that the transonic characteristic discontinuity becomes the positive @xmath37-axis in lagrangian coordinates , we formulate the problem in eulerian coordinates into the following initial - boundary value problem for equations : @xmath108 once we solved @xmath22 from this problem , we then obtain the free boundary in eulerian coordinates @xmath109 these are the corresponding forms in lagrangian coordinates for problem .      the entropy solutions of problem can be defined in the standard way via integration by parts .",
    "we note that the existence of entropy solutions to problem can be constructed easily by using the front tracking method as carried out in @xcite provided that @xmath110 is sufficiently small .",
    "in particular , the following lateral riemann problem with the boundary data @xmath46 on the characteristic boundary @xmath111 is uniquely solvable .",
    "[ lemma 2.1 ] consider the following lateral riemann problem : @xmath112 there exists @xmath113 so that , if @xmath114 lies in the ball @xmath115 with center @xmath16 and radius @xmath116 , then there is a unique admissible solution that contains only a @xmath117-wave .",
    "note that system is strictly hyperbolic for @xmath101 .",
    "for each point @xmath22 with @xmath101 , in its small neighborhood , we can obtain @xmath118-wave curves @xmath119 , so that @xmath120 and @xmath121 : @xmath122 is connected to @xmath123 from the upper side by a simple wave of @xmath105-family with strength @xmath124 ; for @xmath125 and @xmath106 , this wave is a rarefaction wave , while , for @xmath126 and @xmath106 , this wave is a shock .",
    "for @xmath127 , the wave is always a characteristic discontinuity .    for our purpose",
    ", we note that there is also a @xmath118-curve @xmath128 which consists of those states that can be connected to @xmath123 from the lower side by a 3-wave of strength @xmath129 .",
    "we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we set @xmath132 in lagrangian coordinates and use @xmath133 to represent the third argument of the vector @xmath22 .",
    "then , to solve the lateral riemann problem , it suffices to show that there exists a unique @xmath129 so that @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we consider the following function : @xmath135 it is clear that @xmath136 , and @xmath137 by the implicit function theorem , there exists @xmath113 such that , for @xmath138 , there is a function @xmath139 so that @xmath140 . then , similar to lemma 2.2 in @xcite , by using the taylor expansion up",
    "to second order ( recall that @xmath141 is @xmath118 ) , we obtain the following estimate : @xmath142 with a suitable constant @xmath143 depending only on @xmath144    for the reflection of weak 1-waves off the characteristic boundary @xmath111 , we have    [ lem : reflection ] suppose that @xmath145 , and @xmath146 are three states in @xmath147 for sufficiently small @xmath148 , with @xmath149 . then @xmath150 with the constant @xmath151 and the quantity @xmath152 bounded in @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath154 , @xmath155 when @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "the proof here follows the similar argument for lemma 2.4 in @xcite .    for our current problem",
    ", we have to modify slightly the glimm functional as done in @xcite .",
    "in particular , this will allow us to show later that the lyapunov functional @xmath159 ( see section 3 ) decreases when a weak wave of 1-family is reflected off the boundary .",
    "we now introduce the following version of the glimm functional : @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a large constant to be chosen .",
    "the terms @xmath162 and @xmath163 are explained below :    we define the total ( weighted ) strength of weak waves in @xmath164 as @xmath165 here , for a weak wave @xmath166 of @xmath167-family , we define its weighted strength as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a positive constant which has been fixed by considering the reflection coefficient @xmath170 in the strength @xmath171 of the reflected 3-waves in the interaction between weak 1-wave and the characteristic boundary @xmath111 as given in lemma [ lem : reflection ] .",
    "the interaction potential term we used here is a modification to the one introduced by glimm , that is , @xmath172 where the set @xmath173 is of all the couples @xmath174 of approaching wave - fronts .",
    "the term @xmath175 in our wave interaction potential is an additional term , in comparison with the cauchy problem ; and if a weak wave @xmath166 of @xmath176-family is approaching the boundary , we write @xmath177 .",
    "now , for given initial data @xmath14 , we may construct an approximate solution @xmath178 by a front tracking algorithm introduced by @xcite , where @xmath179 is a small parameter measuring the accuracy of the solution , which controls the following four types of errors generated by the algorithm :    * errors in the approximation of initial data ; * errors in the speeds of shock , characteristic discontinuities ( vortex sheet and entropy wave ) , and rarefaction fronts ; * errors by approximating the rarefaction waves by piecewise constant rarefaction fronts ; * errors from removing all the fronts with generation higher than @xmath180 ( @xmath181 depends on @xmath179 ) .",
    "the construction of a glimm functional as above provides the necessary uniform estimates that guarantee the existence of a subsequence of @xmath178 which converges to a bounded entropy solution of in @xmath182 ; l^1(\\mathbb{r}^+))$ ] for any @xmath183 .",
    "the following sections are devoted to the @xmath0stability and uniqueness properties for problem .",

    "firstly , taking @xmath198 and @xmath199 in and using , we obtain @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the whole sequence of approximate solutions @xmath201 converges to the same limit . secondly , taking directly @xmath202 yields .",
    "this again implies that the entropy solution of problem obtained by the front tracking method is unique .    in the following ,",
    "we first define specifically the lyapunov functional and then verify and .",
    "similar to @xcite , when @xmath37 is fixed , for each @xmath203 , we solve a  riemann problem \" with the below - state @xmath43 , the upper - state @xmath44 , by moving along the hugoniot curves @xmath204 , and @xmath205 of system in the phase space .",

    "let @xmath351 , @xmath352 , and @xmath353 \\mapsto \\mathscr{d}$ ] be a continuous mapping taking values in piecewise constant functions , with jumps along finitely many polygonal lines in the @xmath354plane .",
    "then @xmath355    using the essential estimates shown in the earlier sections , theorem [ semithm ] is shown along a similar line of arguments to the one followed by bressan - colombo in @xcite .",
    "the only significant difference here between the wave - front tracking by bressan ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the version of the method ( cf .",
    "holden and risebro @xcite ) we employ is on how to control the number of fronts from growing to infinity within finite time . in @xcite , the accurate riemann solver ( * ars * ) and simplified riemann solver ( * srs * ) are used to construct the approximate solutions . with ( * ars",
    "* ) , waves of each family can be possibly introduced in the riemann solution where every rarefaction wave is divided into equal parts to obtain a rarefaction fan of wave - fronts , while with ( * srs * ) , all new waves are lumped together as a single non - physical front , traveling faster than all wave speeds .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , the simplified riemann solver , rather than the accurate riemann solver , is employed when the interaction term is less than a cut - off function in the order of @xmath356 . in the front tracking method we use ,",
    "the approximate riemann solution is changed by removing weak fronts .",
    "the point of this procedure is that the fronts of high generation are quite weak .",
    "particularly , in our arguments , when the interaction term is less than @xmath179 , this corresponds to new and removed fronts with generation higher than @xmath181 ( here @xmath181 is a suitably large positive integer computed using the initial approximation parameter @xmath179 , see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we also refer to chen - li @xcite for a related analysis with the full euler system where ( * srs * ) is used in place of ( * ars * ) when the interaction term is less than @xmath179 .",
    "thus , using an argument similar to @xcite , one concludes that @xmath357 is a cauchy sequence , converging in the @xmath0sense as long as the error from removing weak fronts tends zero as the initial error parameter @xmath358 ( this has been proved in @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the map @xmath337 defined as the limit of the approximate solutions produced by the front tracking algorithm is well - defined",
    ".    now , the proofs of statements ( i ) to ( iv ) in theorem [ semithm ] are as follows . statements ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iv ) are immediate since @xmath316 is the limit of front tracking approximate solutions @xmath322 .",
    "it is similar to prove ( iii ) as @xcite , but , as discussed above , the wave - front tracking method we employ here is slightly different .",
    "lastly , we observe that the entropy solution fulfills the boundary condition of the initial - boundary value problem ( [ prob ] ) due to the construction of our approximate solutions .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ semithm ] .",
    "in this section , we analyze an arbitrary lipschitz semigroup defined on the domain @xmath330 of @xmath359 functions . in particular , we prove that the semigroup @xmath316 is uniquely determined when the local flow is assigned in connection with the initial data , a piecewise constant function . based on the results in section 4 , we first show that the semigroup @xmath316 generated by the wave - front tracking method is the canonical trajectory of the standard riemann semigroup ( srs )",
    ". then the uniqueness of entropy solutions is shown to extend to a broader class , namely the class of viscosity solutions as introduced by bressan in @xcite .",
    "the essential part here is to show that , in the viscosity class , the entropy solution matches the semigroup trajectory generated by the front tracking method .",

    "note that , in simpler cases such as the potential flow , isentropic or isothermal euler flow , as far as the @xmath0stability problem is concerned , we achieve the same results as the full euler equations .",
