    "a significant part of future development in attosecond science  @xcite and especially molecular high harmonic generation spectroscopy  @xcite is likely to require the use of intense and ultrashort infrared laser pulses in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectral range .",
    "recently mid - ir pulses have been employed to observe the cooper minimum in krypton  @xcite .",
    "secondary sources based on ti : sapphire laser pumped opa in nonlinear crystals are readily available as commercial systems .",
    "few - cycle mid - ir sources have been demonstrated  @xcite , and much progress has been made in the development of optical parametric chirped pulse amplification ( opcpa ) systems  @xcite .",
    "despite rapid progress on mid - ir laser sources , their temporal characterization is still a challenge and underdeveloped compared to the state of the art for pulse characterization at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "an excellent overview over the characterization of ultrashort pulses can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review mid - ir related pulse characterization efforts .",
    "second harmonic generation frequency resolved optical gating ( shg - frog ) has been used to measure the pulse duration of 5@xmath1 m free electron laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "mid - ir pulses at 3.2@xmath1 m from an opcpa system have been characterized with shg - frog  @xcite .",
    "cross - correlation frog has been employed for the measurement of 4.0@xmath1 m pulses in  @xcite .",

    "employed a time - domain homodyne optical technique for spectral phase interferometry for direct electric - field reconstruction ( hot spider ) approach for the characterization of pulses at 9@xmath1m@xcite .    to our knowledge ,",
    "all thus far demonstrated mid - ir pulse characterization methods are multi - shot and offer no spatial resolution .",
    "almost all mid - ir sources are based on nonlinear optical processes , and spatio - temporal effects can play a role in the generation stage .",
    "therefore the development of a wavelength flexible and spatially resolving pulse characterization tool is much needed . in this paper",
    "we report the spatially resolved characterization of up to 1.8mj , 26 to 70fs mid - ir pulses ranging in wavelength from 1.1 up to 2.2@xmath1 m .",
    "we characterize mid - ir pulses with a spatially encoded arrangement for direct electric field reconstruction by spectral shearing interferometry ( sea - spider ) previously used to characterize near - ir pulses centered at 800 nm  @xcite .",
    "spider has the feature that the signal wavelength can be freely chosen by selecting an appropriate ancilla wavelength .",
    "sea - spider offers significant advantages over the traditional spider device and is especially suited for few - cycle pulse characterization  @xcite .",

    "is split off the test - pulse and is guided to the crystal for upconversion with the ancillae beams using only reflective optics .",
    "the remaining part is split into equal halfs to generate two ancilla beams .",
    "each ancilla beam is filtered by a narrowband transmission filter ( f1 , and f2 ) .",
    "the two ancilla beams and the test - pulse beam are focused with a spherical mirror ( fm1 ) to undergo type - i sum - frequency mixing in a 50@xmath1 m ( 100@xmath1 m ) thick bbo crystal for the 1.4 and the 2.2@xmath1 m pulses , respectively .",
    "we choose type - i phasematching over the in spider commonly used type - ii variant to avoid using a waveplate in the ancilla beam . the phasematching bandwidth ( see red line in fig .  [",
    "fig : ancilla](c ) ) is sufficiently broad to cover our desired test pulse range with one single crystal . after blocking the unwanted fundamental beams by spatial filter",
    "sf the two spider signal beams are re - imaged with a focusing mirror ( fm2 ) onto the entrance slit of a homemade imaging spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the signal is dispersed by a 150l / mm al coated grating ( edmund optics ) .",
    "the spider signal is observed in the first grating order and the fundamental signal components are blocked out in the image plane of the spectrometer to avoid the use of color glass bandpass filters .",
    "the grating can be tuned to center the spectrometer on the spider signal for different test pulses .",
    "the spider signal @xmath9 is recorded on a 640@xmath11480pixel , 14bit silicon based ccd camera ( avt gmbh ) .",
    "we employ the sea - spider with direct spectral filtering for ancilla preparation ( sea - f - spider )  @xcite to increase the accuracy in determining the two important calibration parameters spectral shear @xmath12 and upconversion frequency @xmath13 ( definitions in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the choice of ancilla wavelength is entirely free in spectral shearing interferometry  @xcite .",
    "for example one can use ancilla beams around 800 nm ( derived from the unused topas pump light ) to upconvert mid - ir spectra to the visible .",
    "the spider signal will by spectrally centered around @xmath14 .",
    "this means for a given test pulse center frequency @xmath15 the choice in @xmath16 allows to move the signal to a wavelength where the used detector has a good quantum efficiency . for example",
    "a 5@xmath1 m test pulse could be characterized using an ancilla beam centered at 800 nm to generate a spider signal at 690 nm , which lies in a very responsive area of silicon based ccd detectors .",
    "however , the use of an external ancilla pulse would require an external delay - line to temporally overlap the unknown mid - ir pulse with the 800 nm ancilla pulses .",
    "for the current work we had only pulses available up to 2.0@xmath1 m and therefore a short wavelength ancilla is not necessary .",
    "we used part of the unknown pulse s spectrum to derive the ancilla beams .",
    "the spider signal is centered in the near - ir ( range indicated by blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ancilla ] ( c ) ) , where it can be detected with a standard silicon based ccd . in a spider with glass block stretcher or grating compressor , the stretching optics would have to be adapted for each different wavelength .",

    "filters with narrow transmission are readily available .",

    "[ fig : ancilla](a ) and [ fig : ancilla](b ) allow quick , straightforward adaptation of our device to the test pulse signal wavelength .",
    "only small re - adjustments of the ancilla to test - pulse time - delays are necessary after a filter change to account for differences in thickness between different filter sets .",
    "figure  [ fig : ancilla](a ) shows the tuning range of the ancilla filters .",
    "we can generate ancilla beams from 1.2 up to 2.0@xmath1 m , resulting in spider signals centered from 450 to 1000 nm ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ancilla ] ) . the shear will be set by using two filters at slightly different angles .",
    "very large shears of up to 35mrad / fs are easily obtainable with a 25deg filter rotation @xmath17 . it should be noted that the filter only needs to cover a spectral region with sufficient intensity of the unknown pulse . hence , broadband pulses with spectral content well above 2.0@xmath1 m can be characterized in our device as long as there is sufficient intensity around 2.0@xmath1 m . for longer testpulse wavelengths",
    "the silicon based ccd could be reaplced or an external ancilla beam at 800 nm could be used .",
    "sea - spider offers not only single shot capable pulse characterization , but also the acquired spatial information can be exploited . the spectral phase and the pulse spectrum is spatially resolved . in this work the spatially resolved fundamental spectrum",
    "is extracted as absolute value from the ac term ( lines 2 and 3 in eq.([eq : seaspidertrace ] ) ) recovered via fourier filtering of the sea - f - spider trace .",
    "after correction for spectral response of the apparatus and subtraction of the upconversion frequency the spatially resovled spectral amplitude @xmath18 is recovered , which can be used with the spatially resolved spectral phase @xmath4 to perform a space - time reconstruction of the unknown pulse . for a full spatio - temporal pulse reconstruction the spectral as well as the spatial phase has to be measured .",
    "this requires simultaneous spectral , and also spatial shearing interferometry and has been demonstrated for 800 nm pulses  @xcite .",
