    "we present a software package that , starting from high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters , reproduces observations of the icm by the chandra x  ray telescope .",
    "syntetic data can then be processed and analysed using the same tools and procedures as real observations .",
    "this enables us to directly compare the results of the simulations with the observational data and furthermore to compare the intrinsic properties of clusters , as given by simulations , with the same quantities obtained at the end of the process of data reduction and analysis . in this way",
    ", we are able to check the reconstructed properties of clusters as well as to get indication on the quantity of information retained or lost in the observations . on the other hand it has to be remembered that the reliability of the comparison between a simulated quantity and the real counterpart depends on how well the relevant physics inside simulations is modelled .",
    "the package can be easily adapted to run on every kind on hydro - simulations . for our input",
    "we used a set of cluster simulations realized by g.tormen via the resimulation technique of regions of interest inside a cosmological simulation ( see e.g. tormen , bouchet , & white 1996 ) .",
    "this starting simulation reproduces a @xmath0cdm model of universe , with parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and baryon fraction @xmath4 .",
    "it describes a box of size equal to 479 @xmath5 with @xmath6 particles of dark matter .",
    "clusters are identified in its final output using a spherical overdensity algorithm and resimulated singularly from the beginning using the gadget tree - sph code .",
    "each resimulation makes use of @xmath7 particles of dark matter and gas to model the cluster and the surrounding region , while the external tidal field is reproduced by a smaller number of more massive particles .",
    "the mass of the dark matter particles ranges between 2 and @xmath8 depending on the cluster , and the gas particle mass scales accordingly .",
    "the softening related to the cubic spline kernel is @xmath9 . at the end of the simulation the cluster",
    "is described by 2 to @xmath10 particles for each species inside the virial radius .",
    "a set of twelve clusters has been simulated and for each one 50 outputs were retained between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "to8.cm    ' '' ''",
    "in order to describe how the package works , it can be useful to distinguish between a first general part of the method and a second one related to chandra . for a cluster at a given redshift @xmath13 , the first part accounts for the construction of a map of the incoming flux ( or of some other related quantity ) that preserves the energy information .",
    "we start by considering the position @xmath14 , mass @xmath15 , density @xmath16 and temperature @xmath17 for each gas particle @xmath18 .",
    "we then assign to the particle a volume @xmath19 that is assumed cubic and centered on @xmath14 .",
    "we then assign to each particle the related spectral emissivity @xmath20 computed by xspec using the mekal spectral model .",
    "the metallicity enters as a parameter ; here we present results obtained assuming @xmath21 , but any other value is possible .",
    "the luminosity of each particle becomes then @xmath22 and is assumed uniformly distibuted on @xmath23 .    in general , we consider emissivity and derived quantities ( luminosity , flux , surface brightness ) in terms of incoming photons instead of energy because this quantity is more easily related to observations .",
    "given an observational direction , we get a bidimensional map of the cluster spectral luminosity projecting each @xmath24 on a pixellized perpendicular image and summing on particles .",
    "the information is then stored in a 3d array , where two dimensions are spatial and the third one contains the energy channels .",
    "the transformation from the cluster luminosity at redshift @xmath13 to the flux per pixel at @xmath12 is then direct : in term of incoming photons , it holds @xmath25 being @xmath26 the luminosity distance .",
    "note that the frequency @xmath27 in the flux is related to @xmath28 in the cluster luminosity .",
    "typically , the number of pixels ranges from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , depending on the field of view , while the energy ranges from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in bins of @xmath33 , even if @xmath34 should be sufficient according to the energy resolution of chandra ( chandra proposers observatory guide ) .",
    "it has to be remembered that a simulator of chandra already exists : it is called marx and performs the ray - tracing of incoming photons of a given source inside the telescope up to the possible final detection .",
    "it returns a list of binary data files describing the detection events that can be assembled to reproduce a cxc level 1 fits data file .",
    "however , only some kind of sources of simple form and uniform spectral flux are implemented in marx , while users are allowed to construct their specific source writing some c routines and linking it dynamically to the code .",
    "so did we , as described in the following .    for a given cluster ,",
    "we generate a list of incoming photons by random extraction from the cumulative distribution of the spectral flux array described above .",
    "each photon hence owns a position in a pixel and an energy in the energy band , with the given resolution .",
    "other random extractions define the position of photon inside the pixel and its energy in the bin . the number of photons extracted is set to @xmath35 .",
    "we then enable marx to accept as input this photon list and the total flux of the cluster ( in @xmath36 ) : photons are randomly extracted from the list according to the total flux and the exposure time , and usually processed up to the possible detection .",
    "no background is introduced by marx .",
    "we add background events randomly extracting them from chandra acis observations of empty fields available in the home page of m.markevitchmaxim ] .",
    "an example of a complete simulated observation is shown in the fig",
    "as written above , the detection events generated by marx have the same caracteristics of the cxc level 1 observational data file and can be analysed using the same procedures and ciao tools .",
    "this analysis is currently in progress and will concern the reconstucted properties of clusters , the cluster morphology ( maps and profiles ) and its relation to the dynamical state of the object .",
    "detectability of clusters at high redshift is another possible application .",
    "we plan to extend this package to the xmm - newton telescope , using the related simulator scisim , in the next future .",
    "the author wish to thank l.moscardini , g.tormen and s.degrandi , that collaborate to this project ."
