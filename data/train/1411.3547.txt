    "partial wave analyses of @xmath1 data @xcite have provided us with much data on amplitudes , cross sections and resonance properties .",
    "it has also been the subject of intense theoretical investigations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent updates on the subject ) .",
    "the introduction of the chiral unitary techniques to study these reactions in ref .",
    "@xcite resulted in surprising news that the @xmath8 resonance was dynamically generated from the interaction of meson baryon , with a price to pay : coupled channels had to be introduced .",
    "some of the channels were closed at certain energies , like the @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the region of the @xmath8 , but they were shown to play a major role in the generation of this resonance , to the point of suggesting in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath8 could qualify as a quasibound state of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "work on this issue followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , corroborating the main findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , and posteriorly in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the chiral unitary approach",
    "the loops of the bethe - salpeter equation must be regularized , and this is done with cut offs or using dimensional regularization .",
    "the cut off , or equivalently the subtraction constants in dimensional regularization in the different channels should be of `` natural size '' , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if one wishes to claim that the resonances have been generated dynamically from the interaction .",
    "however , this is not the case of the @xmath8 , where different cut offs in ref .",
    "@xcite , or different subtraction constants in ref .",
    "@xcite for different channels must be used .",
    "this is unlike the case of the @xmath13 , where a unique cut off in all channels leads to a good reproduction of the data @xcite .",
    "this fact was interpreted in ref .",
    "@xcite as a manifestation of the nature of the two resonances , where the @xmath13 would be largely dynamically generated , while the @xmath8 would contain a nonnegligible component of a genuine state , formed with dynamics different from the pseudoscalar meson interaction .",
    "one might think of remnants of an original seed of three constituent quarks , but this is not necessarily the case .",
    "it could also be due to the missing of important channels different than pseudoscalar - baryon .",
    "actually this has been a source of investigation recently , where the mixing of pseudoscalar - baryon and vector - baryon channels has led to interesting results and some surprises . in ref .",
    "@xcite the vector - baryon interaction was studied using the method developed in ref .  @xcite but mixing also pseudoscalar - baryon components .",
    "it was found that the mixing produced a shift of some of the resonance positions of ref .",
    "@xcite and led to some increase in the width .",
    "similar results have been obtained recently in refs .",
    "one of the interesting outcomes of this line of research was to see that the consideration of the @xmath1(d - wave ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6(s and d waves ) in the sector of spin - parity @xmath14 with chiral dynamics led to a good reproduction of the @xmath1 data in d - waves and to the generation of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 resonances @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 are obtained with only pseudoscalar - baryon states using an offshell approach , which is in principle equivalent to having different subtraction constants in different channels . by means of that one",
    "can effectively take into account the effect of missing channels . in our work",
    "we explicitly introduce from the beginning a larger space of channels . in the present work we want to extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to the sector of @xmath17 , with the aim to see if the mixture of the pseudoscalar - baryon and vector - baryon channels can remove the pathology observed by the need of different subtraction constants in different channels .",
    "we will show that this is the case and then we shall be able to conclude that the missing components of the wave function in the @xmath8 noted in ref .",
    "@xcite are due to vector - baryon and additional @xmath6 states that we shall also mix in the present coupled channel approach .",
    "the most important coupled channels of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( d - wave ) .",
    "some of the matrix elements of the interaction between these channels have been well studied as the @xmath18 transition mediated by a vector meson exchange addressed in ref .",
    "the diagram involved in this transition is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vbcontact ] and the potential of this transition is given by @xmath19 the @xmath20 transition coefficients are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . however , since those coefficients are in charge basis we need to convert them to isospin basis , as show in table  [ tab : coeffpb ] .",
    "similarly , the @xmath21 transition has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and the coefficients are given in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".coefficients of @xmath20 transition with @xmath22 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking at table  [ tab : couplingsn1535 ] we see that the @xmath5 channel has the strongest coupling to @xmath8 but the resonance is below the threshold , however due to the width of the @xmath23 we can generate enough phase space and obtain a small width , but in a very good agreement with the experimental results , as seen in table  [ tab : resn1535 ] .",
    "the @xmath12 channel has a coupling as big as the @xmath5 but as the resonance is below the threshold it has not phase space to decay .",
    "similarly the coupling to channel @xmath11 is big but again there is not phase space for decay . on the other hand the @xmath6 channel has a very small coupling but around @xmath24 mev of phase space , so this gives it a small branching ratio which agrees with the experimental values .",
    "the other channels @xmath1 and @xmath2 have smaller couplings but since they have much momentum to decay they have big branching ratios in good agreement with the experimental results . concerning the width of the @xmath8 in table  [ tab : resn1535 ]",
    "we should note that , although the theoretical width obtained from the pole in the complex plane is smaller than the experimental one , the apparent width from im@xmath25 in the real axis , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitn1535 ] , is much closer to the experiment .",
    "for the case of @xmath9 the @xmath12 channel has now the biggest coupling to this resonance , but as the resonance is below the threshold it has no phase space for decay . the same as before happens to the @xmath5 channel , the small momentum generated with the mass convolution of the @xmath23 gives a small width but in qualitative agreement with the experimental value . although the channels @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 have smaller couplings , due to the huge phase space that they have , the branching ratios are quite big , which is in a very good agreement with the experimental results of pdg , but with single experiments as well , as seen in table  [ tab : resn1650 ] .",
    "now , the @xmath11 channel is open and the value found for the branching ratio is in good agreement with the only experimental value available of ref .",
