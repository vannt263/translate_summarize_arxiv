    "the great progress have been made on the observations of molecular motor since h. f. huxley and h. e. huxley @xcite@xcite@xcite proposed the rotating cross - bridge model to study muscular mobility in 1954 .",
    "more and more biologists and theoretical biophysicists concentrate on studying the mechanism of the living system and mincing the biological structure to invent subtle artificial instrument . based on different system , three different families of motor proteins",
    "have been identified @xcite@xcite@xcite , kinesins and dyneins move along tubulin filaments@xcite , myosin move along actin filaments @xcite@xcite.the motion mechanism of the three kinds of motors can be described as follows @xcite @xcite@xcite : firstly , the motor binds adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) , then hydrolyzes the bound atp and absorbs the energy , subsequently , the motor releases the products adenosinediphosphate ( adp ) and phosphate ( p ) , so the motor move constantly within the chemical cycle .",
    "the molecular motors play a key role in transuding chemical energy into mechanical work at a molecular scale .",
    "up to date there have been three kinds of archetype models proposed to study the molecular motor system : namely the fluctuation models , the phase transition models and the resonance models .",
    "+ one archetype fluctuation model is ratchets model .",
    "this model looks molecular motors as heavily damped brownian particles and the model explains the molecular motor s motion by studying a single particle in a potential inspired by feynman s ratchet .",
    "m. o. magnasco @xcite and r. d. astumian@xcite@xcite have proposed the forced thermal ratchets model , the fluctuant force break the symmetry of the system , so that the system can absorb the energy from the surroundings , the motor undergoes similar brownian motion and produces net transport .",
    "although the fluctuation models have discussed different aspects of molecular motors , there still exits a matter of debate on the mechanism of its motion .",
    "+ the second typical model is phase transition model : the two state model proposed by f.julicher@xcite and isothermal ratchet model proposed by a. pameggiani@xcite . using the basic idea of the ising model for phase transitions",
    ", they have studied a single motor or many motors moving in asymmetry periodic potential . in these models the microtubule and molecular motor are treated as periodic polar railway tracks and carnot engines with cargoes , the motor consumes chemical energy and causes the system conformation change , so the phase transition occurs between two states .",
    "the models give a good explanation on the efficiency of the motor . + the newly type resonance model is named the stochastic inclined rods model ( sirm ) proposed by h. matsuura and h. matsuura@xcite , in the model the energy of motion was supplied from the random noise and the system always moves to one direction by using stochastic resonance .",
    "the movement of the system does not break the second law of thermodynamics , because the actin - myosin system is open to the surroundings and the energy flows in from their surroundings .",
    "the sirm presents a perfectly sliding mechanism of the actin - myosin system , but the interaction is too simple and only repulsive force is considered .",
    "the main aim of our paper is that based on sirm we study muscle s motion under a complex intermolecular potential and discuss the effect of the spring on the system .",
    "in order to describe the motion of actin - myosin system , we simulate it by a mechanical model as shown in fig .",
    "sirm is composed of three parts : an inclined spring , a myosin head and myosin bundle .",
    "our model proposed a microscopic mechanism for the actin - myosin system : the random noise is from the water molecules generated through the heat energy of atp hydrolysis .",
    "atp supplies the heat energy and provides heat energy to the surrounding water molecules , which accelerates the movement of the water molecules , so the random noise ( the water molecules ) can interact with the myosin head , and the resonance occurs between the myosin head and the noise , then it collides with a g - actin and obliquely kicks the g - actin sphere , because the direction of vibration is inclined against the line of the actin fibers , myosin molecules obtain the propellant force along the direction of the fiber and the myosin can move to one direction . +    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the figure we can know that the repulsive potential can accelerate the system s motion and the potential between the g - actin and myosin can decide the motion s velocity .",
    "based on the sirm we study the movement of actin - myosin system with a jennard - jones potential . from the numerical results we can know there is relative sliding motion between the filament and the g - actin and",
    "the average gliding speed is @xmath0 which well agree with the experimental data .",
    "when the system absorbs the energy from the thermal noise constantly through stochastic resonance , the intermolecular potential and the inclined rod make the filament move to one direction .",
    "the system can convert the random noise to one directional motion .",
    "the effective radius of g - actin , the constant of the spring and the intermolecular potential are important for the system to move .",
    "if the constant of the spring is small , the system can not move , and if the effective radius of g - actin is too small or too big the system can not move , either . the repulsive",
    "potential makes the system move fast . from the results we can predict the state of the muscle : if the constant of the spring or the effective radius of g - actin become small , the sirm can not move at all and muscle is fatigue , if the effective radius of g - actin is too big , the velocity of the system is zero and the actin - myosin system may be breakdown .",
    "+ sirm is thermally open to the outer surroundings and it has a outer heat source of atp . the heat or energy consumed by sirm is directly supplied from the surroundings ( i.e. the thermal motions of water molecules ) .",
    "the entropy always increases since the flow is positive , therefore , the system does not break the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "there have been many discussions on the movement of ratchets in a heat bath . among them , we only consider one famous discussion of feynman@xcite .",
    "feynman showed from statistical discussions that the ratchets under an isothermal temperature can not turn as a total since the ratchets turn to both sides with equal probability .",
    "however , he also showed in the same section , 46 - 2 , of ref.@xcite that it can turn to one side if a load is suspended from the one side even in an isothermal bath .",
    "our model can work even under isothermal temperature conditions , since it has a load , which is an intermolecular potential of the g - actin fastened to a z - membrane .",
    "+ noise in dynamical systems is usually considered a nuisance .",
    "but in certain nonlinear systems including electronic circuits and biological sensory apparatus the presence of noise can in fact enhance the detection of the weak signals . from the above results , we point out the possibility that the actin - myosin system can use thermal noise around for the movement in similar way .",
    "this viewpoint is completely new as the traditional viewpoint thinks the water disturbs the motion as viscosity .    0.2 in huxley a e and simmons r m 1971 nature 233 533 .",
