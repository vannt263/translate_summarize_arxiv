    "a classical problem in theoretical astrophysics is to establish the non - linear stability of galaxies in equilibrium . neglecting relativistic effects and collisions among the stars of the galaxy",
    ", these equilbrium states can be described as stationary solutions of the vlasov - poisson system : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes the distribution function in phase space of the stars , which are assumed to have all the same mass , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 denoting time , position and momentum , respectively ; @xmath5 stands for the mean gravitational field generated by the stars altogether . in our units , the gravitational constant and the mass of each star equal one .    a general method to approach the stability problem for an infinite dimensional dynamical system is to construct stationary solutions as minimizers of a suitable functional which is preserved by the evolution .",
    "the specific choice of the functional to minimize and of the constraints in the variational problem selects the type of steady states to be constructed , as well as the notion of distance which appears in the non - linear stability theorem .",
    "this approach was successfully applied to establish non - linear stability for a large class of steady states to the vlasov - poisson system , see @xcite . an important pre - requisite for this method to yield a rigorous stability theorem",
    "is that sufficiently regular solutions of the dynamical system should exist for general initial data of the cauchy problem ( or at least for data close to the steady state ) . in the case of vlasov - poisson",
    ", the existence of global classical solutions for general initial data has been known for some time , see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the non - linear stability for a class of stationary solutions as well as the asymptotic behaviour of general solutions to the nordstrm - vlasov system @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a genuine relativistic generalization of the vlasov - poisson system in the following sense : it is invariant under lorentz transformations and its solutions converge to solutions of vlasov - poisson as the speed of light tends to infinity . in units such that the speed of light equals one ,",
    "the nordstrm - vlasov system is given by @xmath6 @xmath7\\cdot\\nabla_p f= 4 f\\ , s\\phi,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 are the relativistic velocity and the relativistic free transport operator .",
    "as compared to the vlasov - poisson case , the stability analysis for the nordstrm - vlasov system presents new difficulties related to the strongly nonlinear and hyperbolic character of the field equations .",
    "these new features make the problem under study relevant from a mathematical point of view , besides its original astrophysical motivation .    a fundamental role in our analysis",
    "is played by the conserved quantities for the system ( [ nordstrom])-([vlasov ] ) .",
    "let us mention here the energy functional , or hamiltonian , @xmath9 and the casimir functional @xmath10 where @xmath11 is any sufficiently regular function .",
    "in particular , for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , we infer that @xmath14 is constant , the case @xmath15 being the conservation law of mass . for the purpose of the present investigation , it is convenient to introduce the new dynamical variable @xmath16 in terms of which the nordstrm - vlasov system takes the form @xmath17 @xmath18 the energy functional becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 while the casimir functional reads @xmath21 in particular @xmath22 is constant , for all @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the main reason to adopt this new formulation of the nordstrm - vlasov system is that the field @xmath24 does not appear explicitly in the definition of the casimir functional .",
    "let us also notice that the particles distribution @xmath25 and the gravitational potential @xmath24 in the energy functional of the nordstrm - vlasov system are independent variables , whereas for vlasov - poisson they are related by the poisson formula @xmath26 . in the following",
    "we shall denote @xmath25 simply by @xmath27 to lighten the notation .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to underline the differences between the vlasov - poisson system and the nordstrm - vlasov system related to the relativistic character of the latter model .",
    "we will then focus our attention on the stability analysis to a simple class of steady states , namely the isotropic polytropes , which in the case of the nordstrm - vlasov system are defined as @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants , @xmath32 is the particles energy , @xmath33 denotes the positive part .",
    "the existence of a maximum @xmath34 for the particles energy is necessary for the steady state to have finite energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 is the gravitational potential induced by the distribution @xmath36 and is a solution of the non - linear poisson equation @xmath37    our proof of stability for solutions of the form ( [ polytropes])-([poisson ] ) is grounded on a variational argument similar to the one introduced in @xcite to study the orbital stability of polytropic spheres for the vlasov - poisson system and which consists in minimizing the energy functional subject to the constraints of given mass and @xmath38 norm of @xmath27 , for some @xmath39 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ dispersion ] by proving that solutions of the nordstrm - vlasov system with energy greater or equal to the mass satisfy a dispersion estimate in terms of the conformal energy .",
    "this estimate does not imply that steady states solutions must have energy smaller than the mass , because for these solutions the conformal energy is unbounded . in section [ results ] we state our main results on the stability of isotropic polytropes for the nordstrm - vlasov system and reduce the problem to that of minimizing the energy functional under suitable constraints .",
    "some preliminary estimates necessary to solve the latter problem are given in section [ bounds ] .",
    "in particular it is shown that the energy of minimizers is bounded above by their mass , thus a connection with the result of section [ dispersion ] is established . in section [ existencemin ]",
    "we prove the existence of minimizers to the energy functional and show that they arise as the strong limit of suitable minimizing sequences .",
    "our proof requires the minimizers to have energy _",
    "strictly _ less than the mass , a property which is shown to be verified if the mass is sufficiently large .",
    "finally , in section [ properties ] we establish uniqueness and spherical symmetry of the minimizer ( up to a translation in space ) and show that it is an isotropic polytrope solution of the nordstrm - vlasov system with finite radius .    to conclude this introduction we remark that relativistic theories of gravity , although not physically correct , are often used as simplified models for general relativity @xcite .",
    "moreover , scalar fields play a central role in modern theories of classical and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the physically correct relativistic model for self - gravitating collisionless matter is the einstein - vlasov system , which is discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "existence and finite radius property of steady states to the einstein - vlasov system have been studied in @xcite , see also @xcite , but the question of their stability is currently open ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the present work on the stability of steady states to the nordstrm - vlasov system may contribute to a better understanding of this important problem .",
    "the aim of this section is to prove a dispersion estimate for solutions of the nordstrm - vlasov system .",
    "although this estimate will not be used in the following sections , it reveals an interesting link with the assumptions in our stability theorem , see section [ results ] .",

    "this solution preserves energy and mass and has finite conformal energy for all times ( provided it is bounded at time zero , _",
    "e.g _ , by giving compactly supported initial data for the field ) .",
