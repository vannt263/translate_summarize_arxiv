    "estimation and detection are two main concerns in the course of designing a communication system  @xcite . the main goal is to design optimal demodulators at the receiver side providing the detector with the necessary sufficient statistics for its decision on the transmitted symbol at a specific observation interval .",
    "furthermore , the optimization of the decision device is also a target , i.e. , its design based on such statistical tests which rely on sufficient statistics and minimize the probability of error .",
    "a different setup of optimal designs related to radar and sonar systems is to detect the presence of either a deterministic or random signal in noise with least probability of error or false alarm  @xcite .",
    "although the two aforementioned setups have conceptual differences , they are usually treated in the same fashion .",
    "first , an optimal demodulator is necessary to deliver the sufficient statistics to the decision device .",
    "then , the decision device , that optimally uses these sufficient statistics , has to be derived .",
    "the optimal design of the decision device is formulated in any case as a hypotheses testing problem .",
    "moreover , the optimization of the transmitter is another related problem . in this case",
    ", the problem turns to be the design of optimal transmission sets , such that the end performance metric , i.e , the probability of error is minimized .",
    "depending on the degree of knowledge about the transmission channel at the receiver side , the detector can be coherent , semi - coherent or noncoherent  @xcite .",
    "the more information about the transmission channel is available , the better the receiver s performance will be .",
    "this justifies the fact that the receivers usually have a built - in channel estimator . in the communication and signal processing literature ,",
    "the usual channel estimators are the minimum variance unbiased ( mvu ) and the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimators @xcite . the combination of these channel estimators with the optimal decision devices is usually considered to address the problem of determining the optimal receiver",
    ".    current physical layer ( phy ) standards that have attracted a lot of attention both from the mobile industry and the research community are the wireless interoperability for microwave access ( wimax ) , the long term evolution ( lte ) and the digital video broadcasting ( dvb ) either in its terrestrial ( dvb - t ) or its handheld ( dvb - h ) versions @xcite .",
    "these standards are orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) based and they can satisfy the need for shorter communication links to provide truly broadband connectivity services . in these systems , either mvu / least squares ( ls ) or mmse channel estimators",
    "are used , usually employing some sort of estimate interpolation through the frame if the goal is to track a time - varying channel @xcite .    in this paper , we re - examine the validity of the common belief that the mvu and mmse channel estimators are the best choices to be combined with the optimal detectors , delivering an overall optimal receiver , when finite - sample training is used to estimate the channel .",
    "to this end , ideas originating from the system identification field are employed .",
    "recent results in optimal experiment design indicate that it is better to design the optimal training for the estimation of a certain set of unknown parameters with respect to optimizing the end performance metric rather than the mean square error of the parameter estimator itself  @xcite .",
    "we will slightly modify this idea and we will examine if the aforementioned channel estimators are the best choices , when the selection of the channel estimator is made with respect to an appropriately defined end performance metric . for illustration purposes , this study is performed on a toy channel model , namely a single input single output ( siso ) flat fading channel with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the initial focus is on two different mse criteria .",
    "these mse criteria serve to demonstrate the dependence of the optimal channel estimators on the end performance metrics .",
    "their choice is based on the simplicity of the analysis that they allow .",
    "then , using the obtained results , we will examine the case of the error probability as the performance metric of interest .",
    "we show that for several performance metrics examined in this paper , the mvu and mmse channel estimators are suboptimal , while we propose ways to obtain better channel estimators .",
    "finally , we numerically compare the performances of the derived channel estimators with those of the mvu and mmse channel estimators for all performance metrics in this paper .",
    "these comparisons verify that the optimality of the usual channel estimators with respect to common end performance metrics is questionable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : probst ] defines the problem of designing the channel estimator with respect to the end performance metric .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] presents some results and comments that will be useful in the rest of the paper , while it introduces approximations of the performance metrics that the rest of the analysis will be based on .",
    "the optimality of the mvu and mmse channel estimators with respect to the minimization of the symbol estimate mse is examined in section  [ sec : dmse ] and subsections therein , while uniformly better channel estimators are also proposed . the same analysis as in section",
    "[ sec : dmse ] is pursued in section  [ sec : emse ] for a differently defined symbol estimate mse and in section  [ sec : minpe ] for a rough approximation ( variation ) of the error probability performance metric .",
    "section  [ sec : sims ] illustrates the validity of the derived results .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "the received signal model for a siso system , when the channel is considered to be narrowband block fading , is given as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the observed signal at the receiver side at time instant @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the complex channel impulse response coefficient , @xmath4 is the transmitted symbol at the same time instant taken from an m - ary constellation @xmath5 and @xmath6 is complex , circularly symmetric , gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath7 .",

    "this is with respect to minimizing the probability that a different symbol from the one transmitted is decided given the transmitted symbol .",

    "a different kind of performance metric is the mse of a _ linear _ symbol estimator . in this paper",
    ", we will call the symbol estimator an _ equalizer_.",
    "the equalizer uses the channel knowledge and delivers a soft decision of the transmitted symbol , i.e. , a symbol estimate .",

    "we observe that as the snr increases , i.e. , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we will call @xmath28 the _ zero forcing _ ( zf ) clairvoyant equalizer . using the above definitions and assuming that the receiver has only an estimate of the channel , the system performance metric is the symbol estimate mse : @xmath29.\\label{eq : msedirect}\\ ] ]    the mse given by ( [ eq : msedirect ] ) can be defined in two different ways : if we assume that the channel is an unknown but otherwise deterministic quantity , then the expectation in ( [ eq : msedirect ] ) does not consider @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to an mse expression dependent on the unknown channel @xmath3 . in this case ,",
    "only the channel estimators that treat the channel as an unknown deterministic variable are meaningful .",
    "if we assume that the unknown channel is a random variable , then we can average the mse expression over @xmath3 . in this case , both the estimators that treat the channel as an unknown deterministic variable or as a random variable are meaningful .",
    "the former represents the case where the system designer chooses to ignore the knowledge of the channel statistics in the selection of the channel estimator for some reason .    in the following , we focus on the zf equalizer , which becomes optimal as the snr increases",
    "this choice is made to preserve the simplicity of this paper and to highlight the derived results .",
    "the previous mse definition implies the definition of yet another mse that is meaningful in the context of communication systems .",
    "given an equalizer , we can define the excess of the symbol estimate based on an equalizer that only knows a channel estimate over the equalizer with perfect channel knowledge , thus leading to @xmath30.\\label{eq : mseexcess}\\ ] ] in the sequel , this metric will be called _ excess _ mse .",
    "our goal will be to determine the optimal channel estimators for fixed training sequences so that each performance metric based on a given equalizer is minimized .",

    "<S> the fundamental task of a digital receiver is to decide the transmitted symbols in the best possible way , i.e. , with respect to an appropriately defined performance metric . </S>",
    "<S> examples of usual performance metrics are the probability of error and the mean square error ( mse ) of a symbol estimator . in a coherent receiver , </S>",
    "<S> the symbol decisions are made based on the use of a channel estimate . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focuses on examining the optimality of usual estimators such as the minimum variance unbiased ( mvu ) and the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimators for these metrics and on proposing better estimators whenever it is necessary . for illustration purposes </S>",
    "<S> , this study is performed on a toy channel model , namely a single input single output ( siso ) flat fading channel with additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . in this way </S>",
