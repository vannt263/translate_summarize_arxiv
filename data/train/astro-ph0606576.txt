    "low and medium mass stars ( @xmath218 @xmath3 on the main sequence ) experience an intensive mass - loss phase during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "typically , the agb wind is spherically symmetric .",
    "during the next evolutionary stages , i.e. , the post - agb phase and the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase , a high fraction of stars show asymmetric shapes in their circumstellar envelopes , such as elliptical and bipolar .",
    "one of the hypotheses about the formation of the bipolar shape invokes a binary disk scenario @xcite .",
    "part of the material lost during the intensive agb mass - loss wind is trapped in the binary system , and a circumbinary disk is formed in the plane of the binary orbit . the disk restricts the direction of the low density but high velocity post - agb and pn wind in the equatorial plane , and focuses the wind towards two poles .",

    "( iras  07399@xmath41435 ; ra 07h42m16.83s dec @xmath414d42m52.1s ; hereafter oh  231 ) is one of the well studied post - agb candidates .",
    "tio bands are detected from the central region , suggesting the central star exhibits a m9 spectral type @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed the presence of a spectroscopic binary from optical spectra , because in addition to tio and vo bands from the m - type star , balmer lines and continuum excess are detected .",
    "oh  231 is probably located in the open cluster , m  46 @xcite , thus the distance is relatively well determined ( 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "the outflow is strongly bipolar , and bubbles and shocked regions are found in the outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "l- , n- and q - band seeing - limited images show an unresolved core at the center of this object @xcite .",
    "the infrared color of this compact source is extremely red , and it is believed to be a dusty disk @xcite .",
    "the velocity structure of sio masers also suggest the presence of a rotating disk around this compact source @xcite .",

    "in this paper we present both high resolution infrared ( ir ) images and and mid - ir interferometeric visibilities of the central compact source , so as to resolve the compact source at the center and so as to determine if this source is a disk .",

    "* ) on the very large telescopes ( vlts ) on 2005 march 2nd ( ut ) , using the telescopes melipal and yepun . the observing log is summarized in table  [ table - log ] . from these observing runs",
    ", we also obtained acquisition images ( single dish ) with the adaptive optics ( ao ) system , spectro - photometric data , and visibilities ( correlated fluxes ) for each baseline .",
    "the data reduction software packages mia and ews @xcite were used to reduce the spectra and visibilities . to estimate errors in the visibility data",
    "the mia visibilities were extracted with three different thresholds of noise level , and the difference in the visibilities between these thresholds are counted as errors .",
    "the difference between visibilities due to the choice of the calibration data was counted as a systematic error , and added to the errors derived above .",
    "the ews visibilities are slightly higher than the mia ones but well within error bars .    for spectro - photometry , we used @xcite s templates of hd  139127 ( k4.5iii ) for hd  50778 ( k4iii ) and of hd  180711 ( g9iii ) for hd  61935 ( g9iii ) , and scaled the flux to iras 12  @xmath1 m measurements .",

    "we used the s27 and l27 cameras ( a pixel scale of 27  mas ) .",
    "the central wavelength is 3.80  @xmath1 m and the width is 0.62  @xmath1 m for l-band . the wave - front sensor was used in visible light provided by an ao reference star ( @xmath8=14.2  mag ) approximately 35arcsec away from the central compact object , giving a strehl ratio of about 30  % at 2.12  @xmath1 m .",
    "an nd filter was used for the l-band observations , which reduces the energy by 1.52  % .",
    "the jitterring technique was used to minimize the effect of hot pixels and the sky background was estimated from a medium of jitterred frames with different positions .",

    "the central region is still obscured in nb2.12 image and the bipolar outflow is brighter . on the other hand , in l-band the central region is brighter than the outflow .",
    "this shows that this central region has a very red color , because this region is obscured by extremely high optical depth and/or because it has a very cold temperature , as suggested by previous infrared observations @xcite .    in the nb2.12-band image ,",

    ", there is a bright point - like source .",
    "the naco observations were unable to resolve the source , suggesting the source size @xmath13  arcsec@xmath12 ( fwhm ) .",
    "this provides a more stringent limit than @xcite , who reported an unresolved source with a dimension of @xmath14arcsec@xmath12 at 11@xmath1 m .",

    "[ fig - spec ] shows mid - infrared spectra of oh  231.8 + 4.2 , obtained with midi .",

    "there is a strong silicate absorption from 911  @xmath1 m , however , the flux is not completely zero and is @xmath21  jy .",
    "the silicate absorption band is broad for this source . @xcite and iras lrs observations show 43 and 30  jy at 8  @xmath1 m , respectively and @xcite reported 25 jy at 8.8  @xmath1 m , while our flux is 9  jy at 8  @xmath1 m .",
    "our spectra are from small core region ( about 0.5@xmath150.3  arcsec@xmath12 ) , whereas other measurements for this object are from more extended regions , up to 2@xmath155  arcsec@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "variability at mid - infrared is known for this object @xcite but is not the major reason of the flux discrepancy .",
    "we detected fringes with midi from ` the red and point - like source ' found in the near- and mid - infrared images .",
    "[ fig - correlated - flux ] shows the correlated flux obtained with midi .",
    "correlated flux is clearly recorded below 9  @xmath1 m and above 11  @xmath1 m , but there is only a marginal detection ( @xmath20.1  mjy ) at 911  @xmath1 m . at the wavelength covering the silicate absorption ,",
    "the visibilities are small , either because the flux level from this infrared source is too low or because the source is extended at this wavelength range .",
    "the visibility data are interpreted in the frame of a smooth gaussian profile , as described by @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a gaussian profile is appropriate if the object is optically thin or mildly optically thick .",
    "[ fig - gauss ] shows radii for the gaussian ( given in terms of the ` half ' width of the half maximum ; hwhm ) required to reproduce the observed visibilities at each wavelength .",
    "we clearly see that the structure is resolved on the 3045 mas scale . at the distance of 1.3  kpc @xcite ,",
    "the radii are about 4050  au , as displayed on the right side of the y - axis in fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss ] .",
    "the position angles of these four baselines vary by only 15 degrees .",
    "the observed differences in the correlated flux between the four baselines as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - correlated - flux ] are mainly due to the baseline length , rather than any asymmetry in the object .",
    "this is confirmed by the absence of a significant dependence of the gaussian radii on the baseline lengths at each wavelength point ( fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss ] ) .",
    "these correlated fluxes are therefore resolving structures on scales of 6080 mas in fwhm .    fig .",
    "[ fig - naco ] ( d ) presents the velocity distribution of the 1667  mhz maser emission in ms@xmath9 detected by merlin .",
    "the oh maser data are overplotted on the isaac / vlt l-band image it shows a clear velocity gradient along the torus - like maser distribution .",
    "only blue shifted velocities were detected by merlin .",
    "our l-band and n - band images using the ao system find an unresolved compact object in the center with dimension less than 200  mas .",
    "this object has a red color and consists of circumstellar material .",
    "this circumstellar material is responsible for the fringes detected by mid - infrared interferometer .",
    "there are other emission mechanisms which can cause correlated flux in the mid - infrared , such as ( 1 ) the central star and ( 2 ) the central star + binary companion(s ) , but we can exclude these possibilities . first , the correlated flux of a single star with a radius 3  au @xcite at 1.3  kpc ( 2.3  mas ) is almost 100  % of the total flux ( i.e. unresolved ) with current baseline lengths .",
    "the observed fringes indicate a much larger source size . using the parameters of the central star from @xcite ( @xmath16  k , radius of @xmath17  cm ) ,",
    "the flux of the central star is @xmath26  jy at 10  @xmath1 m , thus the correlated flux should also be @xmath26  jy on any baseline .",
    "the measured values are inconsistent with the expected correlated flux ; the flux drops to 0.10.2  jy for the longest baseline .",
    "thus , the measured visibilities are not from the central star .",
    "second , the silicate absorption is detected in correlated flux , which shows the circumstellar origin of the mid - infrared compact source .",
    "although the presence of a binary companion has been suggested by @xcite , it is unlikely that we measured the orbit of the binary companion around the central star , nor the radius of the binary companion .",
    "a sharp angular dependence of visibilities would be expected in the orbit case , which is not detected ( fig .",
    "[ fig - gauss ] ) .",
    "the possibility of the binary companion radius is ruled out because the flux would be 1  mjy level at 1.3  kpc if the companion is an a0v star @xcite .",
    "therefore , the midi visibilities are due to dusty circumstellar material .",
    "the absence of stellar emission in the correlated flux suggests this material is still optically thick at 10  @xmath1 m .",
    "@xcite analyzed the spectral energy distribution of this object and argued that the mid - infrared unresolved source is a disk .",
    "@xcite measured the velocity distribution of sio maser lines .",
    "the sio masers show the presence of a rotating disk , within 4  mas from the star .",
    "@xcite find that oh velocity structure could be viewed as an expanding torus , with an additional component from a bipolar , ballistic outflow .",
    "our naco images also suggest the presence of a disk or torus .",
    "the central region in the l-band shows a trapezium shape : this may be interpreted as a flared outflow from a torus or a disk .",
    "the trapezium shape is also seen in the nb2.12 image .",
    "the small blobs seen in the trapezium cloud of nb2.12 image , is probably due to non - uniform extinction within the flared disk , or an illusion caused by scattered light .",
    "the north part of the ` trapezium region ' is brighter than other regions in nb2.12 , possibly because the disk is slightly inclined with the northern part nearer to the earth .",
    "the obtained size of the dense circumstellar material is at least 4050 au . the optical depth from our preliminary analysis using _ dusty _ @xcite suggests @xmath18=1.6 and @xmath19=2.7 , showing the actual inner radius is smaller than the values which we measured .",
    "nevertheless , if the density distribution is @xmath20 where @xmath212 , the optical depth increases dramatically for closer inner radii , and the measured size need not be that different from the actual inner radius of the dusty shell or torus .",
    "the hydrodynamic model of @xcite shows that an accretion disk with a radius of 4050 au can be formed in a binary disk .",
    "the co - incidence of the radii from the theory and the observations implies that the circumstellar material is shaped as a disk or torus in this object .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite assumed a binary companion with an orbit of 3  5  au for oh 231 , and the inner radius of the disk might be @xmath22 larger than the companion orbit , which should be 59  au .",
    "our measured inner radius is much larger than @xcite s assumption .",
    "this may be because the companion is actually further out than expected because the central star is larger than expected by @xcite , or because our mid - infrared measurements observe the radius at which disk has cooled down enough to allow dust to condense out of the gas phase .",
    "an alternative solution could be that the disk is gradually expanding and losing momentum , and at the time of the formation , the disk could be much smaller than the current size . in conclusion , we measured the angular size of the circumstellar material in oh  231to be 4050  au , and this material is probably in a disk or toroidal configuration .",
    "future midi observations with different baseline angles are required to confirm the presence of a disk like structure and to measure its inclination angle .",
    "the oh masers are located to the south and east , within the darker lane seen in the l-band image , and trace the waist of the trapezium , allowing for orientation effects .",
    "only foreground ( blue - shifted ) oh is seen : the red emission appears to be more extended and is not picked up by the merlin interferometer , while the blue emission consist of more compact components .",
    "the velocity field shows a clear gradient in the southern part of the maser spots , with @xmath23=2030kms@xmath9 on the east and west edge and the bluest component ( @xmath23=10kms@xmath9 ) in the middle .",
    "it is inconsistent with an expanding torus , but is consistent if we observe the blue - shifted rim of a biconical outflow tilted towards us .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the source change from a rotating disk in the very centre , within a few stellar radii , to a conical outflow at @xmath21000  au .",
    "the stellar position estimated by the the sio maser tracing an equatorial rotating torus @xcite coincides with the central position of the blue - shifted ( @xmath205kms@xmath9 ) biconical distribution seen in oh .    all the components of the binary disk hypothesis @xcite may therefore be present in oh  231.8 + 4.2 : a rotating sio maser disk very close to the central star , a compact circumstellar material at @xmath24050  au which may have a disk - like distribution , and a bipolar outflow .",
