    "cryptography , the science and the art of communicating messages secretly has been the subject of intense research for the last 50 years . the field itself is much older , dating back to as old as 1900 bc , when egyptian scribes , a derived form of the standard hieroglyphics were used for secure communication .    in 1949 ,",
    "shannon , the father of information theory , wrote a seminal paper ( see @xcite ) on the theory of secrecy systems , where he established the area on a firm footing by using concepts from his information theory @xcite . in this lucid paper , among other important contributions , he established the perfect secrecy of the vernam cryptographic system , popularly known as the one - time pad or otp for short",
    ". otp happens to be the only known _ perfectly secure _ or _ provably , absolutely unbreakable _ cipher till date .",
    "shannon s work meant that otps offer the best possible mathematical security of any encryption scheme ( under certain conditions ) , anywhere and anytime @xmath1 an astonishing result .",
    "there have been a number of other cryptographic algorithms @xcite in the last century , but none can provide shannon security ( perfect security ) .",
    "this is one of our motivations to probe into the otp and investigate its properties .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there has been very little work on the otp since shannon .",
    "recently , raub and others @xcite describe a statistically secure one time pad based crypto - system .",
    "dodis and spencer @xcite show that the difficulty of finding perfect random sources could make achieving perfect security for the otp an impossibility .",
    "we shall not deal with the issue of random sources in this paper .",
    "the question we intend to ask in this paper is @xmath1 what can we say about the length of the otp to be transmitted across the secure channel ?",
    "we prove a counter - intuitive result in this paper @xmath1 the length of the otp to be transmitted need not always be equal to the length of the message and that it is possible to achieve shannon security even if the transmitted otp length is actually smaller than the message length .",
    "note that we treat the otp as perfectly random and uncompressible .",
    "however , the length of the otp is one piece of information that is not exploited and is always compromised in its traditional usage .",
    "we construct a protocol where this piece of information can be used effectively to reduce the length of the otp to be transmitted while not losing shannon security for any of the bits of the message .",
    "we then give an alternate interpretation of the otp encryption and follow it up with a new paradigm of cryptography called private - object cryptography .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the otp and its traditional interpretation as xor operation by means of a simple example . in section  3 ,",
    "we prove the central theoretical result of the paper @xmath1 that it is possible to have the transmitted otp length less than the message length while still retaining perfect secrecy .",
    "we first prove a 1-bit reduction of the transmitted otp length and then generalize for a @xmath2-bit reduction for a message of length @xmath3 bits .",
    "we also give an alternative method of compressing the otp based on the length information which is universally known . in section  4",
    ", we provide our new alternate interpretation of the otp as a private - object and the encrytpion / decryption as equivalent to making statements about the object . section  5 talks more about the new paradigm of private - object cryptography .",
    "we claim that every private - key cryptography is essentially a form of private - object cryptography and can provide theoretical security for at least one message of length equal to the entropy of the crypto - system .",
    "we then ask the important question @xmath1 how should we invest @xmath0 bits of secret ?",
    "we hint towards the use of formal axiomatic systems ( fas ) for this purpose .",
    "we conclude in section  6 .",
    "in 1917 , gilbert vernam of at&t invented the first electrical one time pad .",
    "the vernam cipher was obtained by combining each character in the message with a character on a paper tape key .",
    "captain joseph mauborgne ( then a captain in the united states army and later chief of the signal corps ) recognized that the character on the key tape could be made completely random .",
    "together they invented the first one time tape system .",
    "there were other developments in the 1920s which resulted in the paper pad system .",
    "the germans had paper pads with each page containing lines of random numbers .",
    "a page would be used to encrypt data by simple addition of the message with these random numbers .",
    "the recipient who had a duplicate of the paper pad would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of the page .",
    "an otp was used for encrypting a teletype hot - line between washington and moscow .",
    "otps were also used successfully by the english in world war ii .",
    "these were especially useful in battlefields and remote regions where there were no sophisticated equipments for encryption , all that they used were otps printed on silk .",
    "the final discovery of the significance and theoretical importance of the otp was made by claude shannon in 1949 .",
    "we describe the encryption and decryption of an otp by a simple example .",
    "alice and bob have shared an otp ( @xmath4 ) in complete secrecy ( assume that they have met in private and shared the key ) .",
    "one fine day , alice wants to invite bob to her house and wishes to send the message ` come at 8 pm ' to him .",
    "but she is afraid of the interception of the message by eve whom she dislikes .",
    "she therefore encrypts her message as follows .",
    "she first converts her message into binary ( assume that she has a dictionary which converts the message into the bits @xmath5 ) .",
    "she then performs an xor operation to yield the cipher - text @xmath6 .",
    "she transmits this across a public channel .",
    "bob receives the cipher - text @xmath7 .",
    "since he has the otp with him , he does the xor operation of the cipher - text with the otp to yield the correct message @xmath8 .",
    "he then looks up at the dictionary ( this need not be secret ) and converts this to the more readable message ` come at 8 pm '        to summarize ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : otp ] ) :    1 .",
    "the otp is a random set of bits which is used as a private - key known only to alice and bob .",
    "the otp encryption involves an xor operation of the message @xmath9 with the otp to yield the cipher - text @xmath7 .",
    "the otp decryption involves an xor of the cipher - text @xmath7 with the otp to get back the original message @xmath9 .",
    "the classical interpretation of the otp as xor implies the following two important observations .    1 .",
    "the length of the otp is completely compromised in the process of encryption .",
    "one bit of the otp is employed to encrypt exactly one bit of the message and this requires one xor operation .",
    "all bits of the message require the same amount of effort to encrypt and decrypt .",
    "we shall have more to say about the above observations later .",
    "but what can we say about the security of the otp encryption ?",
    "shannon , in his seminal 1949 paper on the theory of secrecy systems @xcite defined perfect secrecy as the condition that the _ a posteriori _ probabilities of all possible messages are equal to the _ a priori _ probabilities independently of the number of messages and the number of possible cryptograms .",
    "this means that the cryptanalyst has no information whatsoever by intercepting the cipher - text because all of her probabilities as to what the cryptogram contains remain unchanged .",
    "he then argued that there must be at least as many of cryptograms as the messages since for a given key , there must exist a one - to - one correspondence between all the messages and some of the cryptograms .",
    "in other words , there is at least one key which transforms any given message into any of the cryptograms .",
    "in particular , he gave an example of a perfect system with equal number of cryptograms and messages with a suitable transformation transforming every message to every cryptogram .",
    "he then showed that the otp actually achieves this .",
    "in other words , the best possible mathematical security is obtained by the otp .",
    "incidently , this is the only known method that achieves shannon security till date .",
    "it has generally been believed that the otps that are transmitted are required to have a length equal to that of the message in order for shannon s argument to hold . in this section ,",
    "we show this is not the case .",
    "although the length of the otp _ while _ encryption need to be equal to the length of the message , the otp that is transmitted could be less .",
    "but this sounds quite paradoxical because the otp is assumed to have been derived from a perfect random source and hence uncompressible .",
    "even if we are able to construct a compression algorithm that compresses some of the generated otps , it has to expand some other otps , it ca nt losslessly compress _ all _ otps .",
    "this is because of the _ counting argument _",
    "@xcite which states that every lossless compression algorithm can compress only some messages while expanding others .",
    "however , we prove the central theoretical result of this paper that the transmitted otp length can be @xmath10 bits less than the message length @xmath0 while still retaining perfect secrecy .",
    "although we might not be able to achieve this reduction all the time , our method _ never expands _ the transmitted otp .",
    "at worst , our transmitted otps are of the length of the message .",
    "we first prove an easier case where the otp could be less than the message by 1-bit and the same idea is employed for the @xmath11bit reduction .",
    "we make use of our earlier observation that the otp encryption compromises its length in its traditional usage which we can actually avoid . +",
    "* theorem 1 :  * _ for every message of length @xmath0 bits , it is equally likely that the transmitted otp was of length @xmath12 or @xmath0 bits while still retaining perfect theoretical secrecy . _ + * proof :  * we shall prove this result by constructing a ( modified ) protocol ( fig .  [",
    "fig : figotp ] ) where alice and bob exchange a message of length @xmath0 by using an otp .",
    "however , in this modified protocol , there is a 50% probability that the transmitted otp had a length of @xmath12 or @xmath0 while still retaining perfect secrecy .",
    "we guarantee perfect secrecy for all the @xmath0 bits of the message .",
    "the protocol works as follows : +   + * step 1 :  * alice performs a coin flip with a perfect coin . if it falls * heads * , she constructs an otp of length @xmath0 and if it falls * tails * she constructs an otp of length @xmath12 .",
    "it is assumed that alice has access to a perfect random source to construct the otp in either events .",
    "+   + * step 2 :  * alice communicates the otp through a secure channel to bob .",
    "+   + * step 3 :  * on some later day , alice intends to send a message of length @xmath0 bits to bob .",
    "if the otp she generated has @xmath12 bits , she appends an additional bit at the end of the otp .",
    "this additional bit is set to @xmath13 if the length @xmath12 is * odd * and to @xmath14 if @xmath12 is * even*. in case the otp already has @xmath0 bits , alice forces the @xmath15 bit to @xmath14 if @xmath12 is * odd * and to @xmath13 if @xmath12 is * even*. +   + * step 4 :  * alice then performs the xor operation of the message with the resulting otp to yield a cipher - text @xmath7 which has @xmath0 bits .",
    "she transmits @xmath7 on the insecure public channel to bob .",
    "+   + * step 5 :  * bob receives @xmath7 . bob checks to see if the otp he had earlier received from alice has sufficient bits to decrypt the message . in other words , does it have @xmath0 bits or @xmath12 bits . in case",
    "the otp has @xmath12 bits , he does the exact same trick which alice did i.e. appends an additional bit and sets it to @xmath13 or @xmath14 depending on whether @xmath12 is * odd * or * even * respectively .",
    "if the otp already has @xmath0 bits , bob forces the @xmath15 bit to @xmath14 if @xmath12 is * odd * and to @xmath13 if @xmath12 is * even*. +   + bob decrypts @xmath7 by performing an xor with the modified otp and obtains the message .",
    "+ we need not prove the perfect secrecy of the first @xmath12 bits as shannon s arguments hold . we need to prove that the @xmath15 bit is perfectly secure .",
    "we shall analyze the situation from the eavesdropper eve s perspective .",
    "eve knows of this entire protocol .",
    "eve intercepts the cipher - text @xmath7 which is of length @xmath0 bits .",
    "she knows that there is a 50% probability that it came from an otp which originally had @xmath12 bits or @xmath0 bits .",
    "she has no other strategy but to make a random guess and the probability of success is 50% .",
    "hence , her guess of the @xmath15 bit is no better than a 50% success .",
    "this proves the perfect secrecy of the @xmath15 bit .",
    "while this result seems highly theoretical and of little practical value , it actually shows an interesting aspect of the otp which has been taken for granted . the fact that the length of the otp contains _ information _ is usually neglected .",
    "our proof was aimed at achieving theoretical security for one additional bit by using the least significant bit ( lsb ) of the length of the otp ( by * odd * we mean lsb@xmath16 and * even * we mean lsb@xmath17 ) and we can do this half of the time .",
    "the natural question to ask is @xmath1 can we make use of the other bits of the length ?          * theorem 2 :  * _ for every message of length @xmath0 , it is possible that the transmitted otp had one of the lengths @xmath18 or @xmath0 with respective probabilities @xmath19 or @xmath20 while still retaining perfect theoretical secrecy . _ + * proof :  * we generalize the aforementioned argument for a @xmath11bit reduction in the length of the transmitted otp .",
    "assume that the message length @xmath3 and let the binary representation of the numbers @xmath21 be the following :  @xmath22 where each of the @xmath23 is binary for all @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "also @xmath26 ( note that @xmath27 since @xmath28 ) .",
    "alice has a @xmath2-sided biased coin which produces otps of length @xmath21 with probabilities @xmath29 .",
    "for encryption of a @xmath0 bit message , alice forces the last @xmath2 bits of the @xmath12 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 otps to the bits @xmath33 respectively .",
    "only for the instance when alice is generating an otp of length @xmath0 bits , she ensures that the last @xmath32 bits never have the same sequence as the other @xmath2 otps before sending it to bob on the secure channel .",
    "moreover , she ensures that the remaining available combinations which are @xmath34 in number have each a probability of occurrence @xmath35 .",
    "this way , the last @xmath2 bits of the otps are perfectly random because the probability of obtaining any particular sequence of @xmath2 bits is @xmath36 .",
    "the rest of the protocol remains unchanged .    with this , we have proved by construction that it is possible for the transmitted otp to have a length lesser than the message length with a non - zero probability while still attaining perfect theoretical secrecy .",
    "it is interesting to see that for larger reductions ( larger values of @xmath2 ) , the probability of obtaining a reduction reduces .",
    "the best average reduction is for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where we get @xmath39 bits of reduction .",
    "the average reduction is given by @xmath40 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath2 is given by the condition @xmath41 which implies @xmath42 .",
    "note that in our protocol , we have not violated the assumption that the otp is perfectly random and incompressible .",
    "alternatively , we can say that the transmitted otp is compressible to the extent the length information allows . we provide a method of compressing the transmitted otp given the fact that the messages to be encrypted are always of length @xmath0 , which is publicly known .",
    "alice generates an @xmath0 bit otp .",
    "if the last bit is 1 , she deletes it to create an @xmath12 bit otp .",
    "if the last bit is 0 , she deletes all bits which are zeros from the end up to and including the bit which is 1 .",
    "if the otp has no 1s in it , then alice transmit it as is .",
    "as an example , consider the @xmath43 bit otp ` 1011001001 ' .",
    "since the last bit is 1 , alice deletes to create the 9-bit otp ` 101100100 ' .",
    "if the @xmath43 bit otp happens to be ` 1011001000 ' , by the above rule , alice obtains the 6-bit otp  ` 101100 ' .",
    "alice transmits the resulting _ compressed _ otp across the secure channel to bob .",
    "since the length of messages to be encrypted is always @xmath43 , bob decompresses the received otp to @xmath0 bits by reversing the rule . in other words , if bob receives a @xmath12 bit otp , he appends a 1 to make it @xmath0 bits . if the received otp is of length @xmath32 bits , where @xmath44 , he appends a 1 followed by @xmath45 zeros .",
    "thus , the otp is correctly decompressed by bob in all instances .",
    "an interesting thing to observe is that the otp is compressed for all instances except the case when it has no 1s .",
    "there is only one such otp ( all 0s ) which is uncompressed by this scheme . at a first glance",
    ", one might wrongly infer that we are contradicting the counting argument .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "the counting argument applies only to _",
    "lossless compression algorithms . in our case",
    ", bob has the _ a priori _ information about the length @xmath0 and hence it is not memoryless .",
    "what are the reductions obtained by this method ?",
    "we can see that for 50% of the instances , there is a reduction by 1-bit only ( the last bit is 1 for 50% of the cases ) . among the remaining 50% , one instance is uncompressed ( the otp with all bits 0s ) and one instance has a maximum reduction of all @xmath0 bits ( the otp with a 1 followed by @xmath12 bits ) . for the remaining otps ,",
    "the compression ratios vary depending on the number of 0s in the end .",
    "for example , an otp with @xmath46 zeros in the end has a reduction of @xmath47 bits .",
    "there are @xmath48 such @xmath49bit otps which will compress to an otp of length @xmath50 bits , a reduction by @xmath47 bits .",
    "in the previous section , we saw how we made use of the length of the otp in obtaining a reduction in its length .",
    "the length happens to be a particular feature of the otp , as if it were an _",
    "object_. this leads us to the notion of a private - object which we define as follows . +",
    "* private - object :  * any object which is known only to the sender and the receiver is defined as a _ private - object_. +    the above definition is very broad .",
    "the object may have any embodiment , not necessarily digital in nature .",
    "the object could be a real physical thing or it could be an one time pad ( could even be multi - dimensional ) .",
    "an important thing to note is that every private - object enables theoretically secure communication .",
    "the entropy of the private - object is determined by the _ number of independent true / false statements _ that can be made about the object without revealing any information about it . the way a message",
    "is transmitted by means of a private - object is described below .",
    "alice and bob share a private - object @xmath51 , known only to them .",
    "alice intends to send a message @xmath9 ( as an example , the statement ` come at 8 pm ' to bob ) .",
    "the protocol is as follows : + * step 1 :  * alice converts message @xmath9 into binary representation ( using a publicly known dictionary ) .",
    "say ` come at 8 pm ' translates to @xmath52 .",
    "+ * step 2 :  * alice substitutes @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore @xmath55 . +",
    "* step 3 :  * for each bit of the message @xmath9 , alice makes statements about the private - object @xmath51 which is true ( if the bit is t ) or false ( if the bit is f ) to obtain the cipher - text @xmath7 . in other words",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 is true , @xmath58 is true , @xmath59 is false etc . as a crude example , assume that the private - object is a physical object which has 3 eyes , 2 hands , 5 legs etc .",
    "alice could make a statement like ` @xmath51 has 3 eyes ' which is true or a statement like ` @xmath51 has 4 legs ' which is false ( the number of legs and hands in this hypothetical object are independent of each other ) . + * step 4 :  * bob receives the cipher - text @xmath7 which is a collection of statements about @xmath51 .",
    "he verifies each statement and determines whether they are true ( @xmath60 ) or false ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "he obtains a string of @xmath60s and @xmath61s by this process ( @xmath55 ) . +",
    "* step 5 :  * bob substitutes @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath9 to obtain the binary message @xmath52 . + * step 6 :  * bob looks up at the dictionary for @xmath9 to obtain the message ` come at 8 pm ' .",
    "+    the otp can be thought of as a private - object @xmath51 and the above protocol can be used for secure communication . for our previous example of section 2 ,",
    "the set of statements which alice would make are @xmath62 ` the first bit of the otp is 1 ' , ` the second bit of the otp is 0 ' @xmath31 ` the tenth bit of the otp is 0 ' .",
    "bob verifies these statements since he has the otp with him and obtains the correct message .",
    "in the previous section , we saw how the otp could be viewed as a private - object and statements about the object can be made to transmit information securely .",
    "so long as the statements are _ independent _ of each other , we are guaranteed to achieve perfect secrecy .",
    "this is because every statement encrypts one bit of the message and is making use of a unique feature of the private - object . for the otp ,",
    "every bit is its unique independent feature . for private - objects of the real physical world",
    ", the features could be the number of edges or the number of faces etc .",
    "determining the number of _ unique _ and _ independent _ features in a physical object might be difficult .",
    "this means that the _ entropy _ of the object is difficult to compute .",
    "the amount of information that can be securely transmitted by this method is upper bounded by the entropy of the object in bits .",
    "private - key or symmetric - key cryptography is a subset of private - object cryptography where the key happens to be a set of bits on which various mathematical operations are made . in effect",
    ", every private - key crypto - system is only making statements about the key which is the private - object .",
    "since the key of a private - key is usually much shorter than the message , the statements are not _ independent _ of each other .",
    "they formally map to complex statements about the key .",
    "we state the following theorem without proof : + * theorem 3 :  * _ every symmetric - key crypto - system can encrypt exactly one binary message having a length equal to the entropy of the crypto - system with perfect theoretical secrecy . _",
    "+    one can always make a certain number of _ unique _ and _ independent _ statements about the crypto - system .",
    "we can treat the crypto - system with its unique parameters as a private - object having a certain entropy .",
    "these statements are _ finite _ in number and can be used to communicate a finite length binary message with perfect secrecy ( equivalent to an otp of the same entropy ) . the length of the message can be at most equal to the entropy of the crypto - system without sacrificing shannon security . finding the entropy of the crypto - system may not always be easy .",
    "another interesting off - shoot is the definition of the _ entropy of an object _ of the real world .",
    "we can invert our above observation to say that the entropy of an object is the number of bits of information that can be transmitted with perfect secrecy by making independent statements about the object .",
    "in other words , we claim that there exists a mapping from every object of the real world to an otp and the entropy of that otp is the entropy of the object",
    ". it may be hard in practice to determine the entropy of objects .",
    "let us now relax the _",
    "perfect secrecy _",
    "constraint since we need to send long keys ( if not as long as the message ) for achieving this .",
    "assume that we have a fixed bit - budget , say @xmath0 bits of secret .",
    "we wish to know what is the best private - object to invest these @xmath0 bits of secret so as to achieve a high encryption efficiency . here",
    ", we do not wish to achieve perfect secrecy , but breaking the system should be very hard . here",
    ", we are being vague in our definition .",
    "it suffices to say that we wish to obtain a method where currently known methods of cryptanalysis have a hard time in breaking , if not impossible .",
    "we wish to propose using a formal axiomatic system ( fas ) for investing these @xmath0 bits .",
    "this part of the paper is a bit speculative in nature and is mainly a motivation towards potential future research .",
    "a formal axiomatic system or fas for short , refers to a system of axioms and rules of inference which together define a set of theorems @xcite .",
    "an example of a fas is typographical number theory ( tnt ) .",
    "hilbert s program was to completely formalize the whole of mathematics using tnt .",
    "this ambitious plan was derailed by gdel who proved that all consistent and sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems contain _ undecidable _ propositions .",
    "because of this , formal axiomatic systems are fascinating objects .",
    "we can view a fas in another interesting way which is the _ compression _ view - point .",
    "a fas is actually a _ compressed _ version of all its theorems which can be proven within the system .",
    "it is this viewpoint that motivates us to consider an fas as a private - object which is shared between alice and bob .",
    "if alice were given a bit - budget of @xmath0 bits , she could invest it in the construction of a fas which is _ consistent _ and _ sufficiently strong_. these are the only two requirements .",
    "she would have to define a set of axioms and rules of inference to completely specify the fas .",
    "she shares this as a _ private - object _ with bob over a secure channel . the way alice and bob can now exchange information is to make statements or strings in the fas . the receiver can _ verify _ whether a particular statement or string is true or false in the fas which they share .",
    "if it is true , then it implies that the string is a _",
    "theorem _ and the bit conveyed is @xmath14 .",
    "if the string is false , then it is a _ non - theorem _ and conveys the bit @xmath13 .",
    "we basically use the private - object paradigm with theorems and non - theorems of the fas acting as binary representations for @xmath14 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "we name such a system as formal axiomatic cryptographic system ( facts ) .",
    "[ fig : figfas ] shows the string space of a fas @xcite .",
    "since the fas is sufficiently strong , it would contain gdelian statements",
    "which are undecidable ( the system is incomplete ) .",
    "we believe that it may be possible to _ confuse _ and _ diffuse _ the cryptanalyst by a clever use of gdelian statements in the cipher - text . this is a speculation on our part , because we do not know of any procedure which would enable us to construct such statements in large numbers .",
    "one of the biggest advantages of such a set - up is the difficulty of breaking the system for eve using brute - force attack . in conventional systems such as the rsa and other public - key and private - key methods @xcite",
    ", brute - force attack would involve trying out all possible keys in the _ key - space_. for example , if the key length is 128-bit , it would mean trying out @xmath63 ( a huge number ) guesses for the private - key .",
    "a computer could mechanically try out these number of possibilities until it found the right key .",
    "this would probably take a long time but with a number of computers in parallel or by using quantum computers , this time could be sufficiently reduced .",
    "the important thing to realize in this scenario is that there is a _ mechanical procedure _ for trying out all the combination and with exponential increase in computational power over time , it could be eventual broken ( eg : the rsa-128 is already broken ) . in our system , the equivalent would be to try out all possible formal axiomatic systems of a given length @xmath0 .",
    "however there would be several systems which are _ duds _ , those that are inconsistent or meaningless .",
    "computers which are designed to try out different fass might have a difficult time to find out inconsistencies .",
    "they might have to deal with the turing halting problem .",
    "to summarize , the central contribution of this paper is a new result in the otp literature .",
    "we have shown that the length of the otp which is traditionally compromised in encryption could be avoided .",
    "we proved that it is possible to reduce the key - length of the transmitted otp ( which is perfectly random and uncompressible otherwise ) while still retaining perfect secrecy . even though this reduction is small",
    ", it is nevertheless useful in saving band - width for crypto - systems which use otps on a regular basis ( we showed that we never expand the otps in any case unlike compression algorithms which always expand some ) .",
    "we have conceived a new paradigm called private - object cryptography which makes use of statements about an object ( private to the communicating parties ) for secure message transmission and showed how the otp can be re - interpreted in this new paradigm .",
