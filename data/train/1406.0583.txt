    "the order parameter may also be viewed as a function that maps points in the physical space to the order parameter space .",
    "the topological properties of the order parameter space are important in the study of defects , since they govern the stability of defects in the field  @xcite .    here",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a new type of singularity formed when a field is mapped to its order ",
    "parameter space ; these defects are governed by the framework of catastrophe theory  @xcite .",
    "theorem  @xcite tells us that catastrophes are stable with respect to perturbation ; consequently features of the field that map to a catastrophe on the order  parameter space manifold must also be stable to perturbations .",
    "this singularity represents a new type of topological defect , which we refer to as an _ order  parameter catastrophe defect _ ( see fig .",
    "[ mapping ] ) .",
    "such catastrophes possess their own topology regardless of the order parameter manifold on which they exist .",
    "their stability is intrinsic to the catastrophe defect , rather than depending on the topology of the order parameter manifold .",
    "this implies that local regions of the field , which map to the order parameter catastrophe defect , transcend the topology of the order parameter space , due to the intrinsic topology of the catastrophe itself .",
    "catastrophe theory may be applied to any system whose order parameter space is `` tattooed '' with such catastrophes .",
    "catastrophes themselves are very generic structures , appearing naturally in many physical systems  @xcite .",
    "hence the concepts presented here will be applicable to a broad range of phenomena .",

    "if the patch contains a texture defect it will wrap the surface of the bloch sphere an integer number of times  @xcite .",

    "when a texture defect exists in a spin field , bloch  sphere catastrophes will also be present",
    ". however , the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "the explicit form of the bloch sphere map is determined by the inverse of eq .  , given by @xmath18 the quantity @xmath19 is the spin asymmetry , which represents the difference in probability density of the spin up and down components .",
    "the bloch sphere image is a 2d histogram of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , each of which are calculated for every @xmath22 point of the spin field .",
    "the mapping takes a patch of the @xmath17plane and calculates the complex functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "together these functions completely define the spin@xmath0 field over the euclidean patch in @xmath1 these states are then mapped to the corresponding @xmath25patch on the bloch sphere .",

    "is equivalent to the @xmath33 component of the curl of the probability current density of a single complex scalar wave - function of the form @xmath34 equation   is a projection that maps the bloch sphere to the argand plane ; this `` @xmath35 map '' is shown in fig .  [ 4panel](d ) .",
    "zeros of @xmath35 are mapped to the equator of the bloch sphere , while the entire equator is mapped to the the origin of the argand plane .",
    "each hemisphere is projected over a unit disc , with the poles mapping to the disc s circumference at @xmath36 . however ,",
    "each hemisphere of the bloch sphere is rotated relative to the other by @xmath37 radians ; this is a direct result of the abrupt phase change @xmath35 acquires when @xmath38 changes sign .",

    "catastrophes are mapped to the bloch sphere along points where the vorticity of @xmath35 vanishes .",
    "catastrophes are associated with an instability of a system . any potential function which governs the behavior of a system will consist of state variables , in this case @xmath17 , and a set of parameters called the control variables .",
    "degenerate critical points of a potential lead to instabilities of the system because a bifurcation may occur at these points when there is a small change in the control variables .",
    "catastrophes exist in the space of the control variables of the potential function .",
    "the dimensionality of the control space is determined by the number of control parameters of the potential function , i.e. the co  dimension .",
    "the _ bifurcation set _ defines a caustic surface embedded in control space ; this corresponds to the set of values of the control variables at which bifurcations of the critical points in the potential function occur .",
    "thom s theorem describes a number of so - called _ elementary catastrophes _ , these being all possible topologically distinct catastrophes that occur when the co - dimension is less than or equal to four  @xcite .",
    "every elementary catastrophe has an associated function known as the canonical form  @xcite . therefore if a local patch of a spin@xmath0 field maps to a particular elementary catastrophe on the bloch sphere , the field itself must have a relation to the canonical form of the catastrophe .",
    "the bloch sphere catastrophe is embedded in the coordinates ( @xmath40 of the sphere .",
    "however , the catastrophe bifurcation set lies in the control space .",
    "in essence , the bloch sphere catastrophe is a slice though the control space of the bifurcation set , which has also been subject to a continuous deformation , rotation and translation .    in catastrophe theory ,",
    "a function has a degenerate critical point when the hessian determinant vanishes .",
    "points of the spin field where the jacobian determinant vanishes map to a catastrophe .",
    "therefore the hessian of the canonical form of the catastrophe , @xmath41 , is locally equivalent to the jacobian matrix of the mapping , i.e. @xmath42 \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\theta}}{\\partial x }   &   \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\theta}}{\\partial y }   \\end{pmatrix } = \\begin{pmatrix } \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2 } & \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y \\partial x } \\\\[0.4em ] \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y } & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y^2 } \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the transformed coordinates of the bloch sphere , which account for the local translation and rotation of the catastrophe from its canonical form . to account for smooth deformations of the catastrophe of the bloch sphere mapping",
    ", the coefficients of the transformations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be functions of the state space coordinates @xmath17 .",
    "since the transformation matrix has an inverse , this allows us to express the bloch sphere coordinates in terms of the transformed coordinates as @xmath45 where the inverse transformation matrix elements @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary functions of @xmath50 which encapsulate the local rotations , translations or deformations of the coordinate system .",
    "given eqs .",
    "and   we find that @xmath26 and @xmath51 may be expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the canonical form of the catastrophe : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "equations   and   show that the bloch sphere catastrophe is indeed a form of gradient mapping of the canonical form of the catastrophe . if a small patch on the spin field in state space were to map to a catastrophe , the field in that patch of state space must relate to the canonical form of the catastrophe .",
    "the field in these local regions has the functional form : @xmath55 \\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\\\",
    "e^{\\frac{i}{2}(a v_x + b v_y)}\\mbox{sin}&\\left[(c v_x + d v_y)/2 \\right ] \\left|1\\right\\rangle .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the bloch sphere coordinates @xmath25 are deformed gradient maps of the canonical form of the catastrophe ; the structure of the zeros of the jacobian determinant determines the type of elementary catastrophe to which the field will map .",
    "in essence , the lines of zeros of the jacobian determinant determine where to fold a patch in @xmath1 , as it is mapped to the bloch sphere .",
    "the way in which the patch is folded yields a particular type of catastrophe .",
    "examples of elliptic and hyperbolic umbilic catastrophes are shown in fig .",
    "[ zeros ] , along with the geometry of each catastrophe s jacobian determinant given in the insets .",
    "the canonical form of the elliptic umbilic catastrophe is @xmath56 , where the null set for the hessian determinant of this form corresponds to the equation of an ellipse , i.e. the zeros of the jacobian determinant map to an elliptic umbilic catastrophe .",
    "similarly the hessian determinant of the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe is the equation of a hyperbola , given by its canonical form of @xmath57 .",
    "we have shown that the spin field is related to the canonical form of the catastrophe by a gradient map , therefore perturbations to the spin@xmath0 field behave as a particular unfolding of the canonical form .",
    "a bloch sphere catastrophe is a particular cross  section of the full bifurcation set surface .",
    "catastrophes may undergo a process known as _ unfolding_. this occurs when the potential function of any given catastrophe is subject to a perturbation in such a way that the slice of the bifurcation set that is viewed on the bloch sphere changes . in this picture",
    "we see that the topological stability of a bloch sphere catastrophe defect arises because every catastrophe already possesses a topology that is fixed by its bifurcation set .",
    "a perturbation to the spin field only serves to unfold the bloch sphere catastrophe , whence we observe different slices through the bifurcation set of the catastrophe .    to demonstrate this consider the full bifurcation set of the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe shown in fig .",
    "[ unfolding](a ) . by inputting the known canonical form and using eq .",
    "we can map an isolated hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe to the bloch sphere and control its unfolding .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .  [",
    "unfolding](b)(e ) .",
    "this method of spin  engineering by way of using a catastrophe s canonical form could be used to generate any bloch sphere mapping at a given unfolding .",
    "the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophes that appear on the bloch sphere are intersections of the bloch sphere surface with the catastrophe s 3dimensional bifurcation set . in this example the cross ",
    "sections are the @xmath58 plane . as the control parameter @xmath59",
    "is varied the @xmath58 plane shifts along the @xmath59 axis , which unfolds the bloch sphere catastrophe . in general , a hyperbolic umbilic bloch sphere catastrophe will express itself as cross ",
    "sections of the bifurcation set through some arbitrary plane , in which case the unfolding of the catastrophe will depend on all three control parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "order  parameter catastrophe defects are a generic form of topological defect that are found in fields .",
    "catastrophes are very general structures that almost always arise in non  trivial mappings to an order parameter manifold .",
    "equations   and show that the order ",
    "parameter coordinates are proportional to the first partial derivatives of a catastrophe s canonical form , which are always simple polynomial functions .",
    "this means that both @xmath20 and @xmath21 will also have a local polynomial form for regions that map to a catastrophe .",
    "if we consider any sufficiently small local expansion about a point of an arbitrary spin field , the patch only need be diffeomorphic to the canonical form of one of the elementary catastrophes .",
    "this criterion is satisfied for the creation of a catastrophe and demonstrates that a mapping of a generic field to its order parameter space will result in caustic tattoos on its manifold .",
    "this is a general result that can be found in other types of mappings .",
    "for example , catastrophes manifest themselves as _ argand  plane caustics _ , which arise when a complex scalar field is mapped to the argand",
    " plane  @xcite . in that context , the condition that a point maps to a caustic , @xmath28=0 $ ] , is equivalent to the optical vorticity vanishing . by making a similar comparison in eq .   for a complex field",
    "it is then apparent that argand",
    " plane catastrophes also rise from gradient mappings .    whilst we have used the specific example of 2d spin1/2 fields and the bloch sphere , it is important to emphasize that all the concepts presented here are very general .",
    "we need only ask what is the mapping of any field to its order parameter space to be able to view the field through the new perspective of order parameter catastrophe defects .",
    "this concept is not restricted to 2dimensions ; the 2d surface of the bloch sphere allows us to view 1d or 2d catastrophes , such as folds or cusps , or 2d cross  sections of higher order catastrophes , such as the elliptic or hyperbolic umbilic catastrophes ( fig .",
    "[ zeros ] ) .",
    "for mappings to order parameter spaces of higher dimensionality , the full bifurcation sets or higher dimensional cross  sections of catastrophes with higher co  dimension would also become observable .",
    "in summary , order parameter catastrophe defects represent a new form of topological defect in fields .",
    "their stability is attributed to the intrinsic topology of the catastrophes themselves rather than that of the order parameter space , as it is the case for standard topological defects and textures .",
