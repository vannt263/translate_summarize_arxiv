    "until now the main application of multi - colour photometry of @xmath0 scuti stars has been the determination of the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath2 , of the observed modes ( e.g. balona & evers 1999 , garrido 2000 ) .",
    "the amplitudes and phases from measurements in various passbands do indeed contain a signature of the @xmath2 value , but there is more information to be extracted from these quantities . in principle",
    "we may calculate their theoretical counterparts . for this",
    "we need appropriate stellar models and a linear nonadiabatic code for calculating model oscillations . from such calculations",
    "we derive the complex ratio of the local flux variation to the radial displacement at the photosphere , @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath0 scuti stars , however , there is a large uncertainty arising from lack of adequate theory of stellar convection .",
    "the uncertainity is reflected in a strong sensitivity of @xmath1 to the mixing - length prameter , @xmath3 , which translates to calculated mode positions in the amplitude ratio vs. phase difference diagrams .",
    "this strong sensitivity to the treatment of convection is not necessarily bad news , if we can determine simultaneously @xmath2 and @xmath1 . for this aim",
    "we need data from at least three passbands . if we succeed , then the @xmath1-value yields a useful constraint on convection .",
    "in addition , if the identified mode is radial , the multi - passband data may be used to refine stellar parameters .",
    "finally , the use of radial velocity measurements in our method improves significantly determination of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the presented method is based on @xmath4 minimization assuming trial values of @xmath2 .",
    "we regard the @xmath2 degree and the associated complex @xmath1 value as the solution if it corresponds to @xmath4 minimum , which is much deeper than at other values of @xmath2 .",
    "we write the photometric complex amplitude in the form of the linear observational equation for a number of passbands , @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 on the right - hand side we have measured amplitudes , @xmath8 , expressed in the complex form .",
    "the quantities to be determined are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "if we have data on spectral line variations , the set of equations ( 1 ) may be supplemented with an expression for the first moment , @xmath11 , @xmath12 for more details and generalization of the method to the case of modes coupled by rotation see daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "here we rely on kurucz ( 1998 ) models of stellar atmospheres and claret ( 2000 ) computations of limb - darkening coefficients . for application of the method we used @xmath13 strmgren photometry in all cases .    * @xmath14 cas * : @xmath14 cas is a near and bright @xmath0 scuti star , therefore we have rather precise parameters for it .",
    "its estimated value of mass is @xmath15 . in the left panel of fig.1",
    "we show @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 obtained for three models .",
    "the minimum at @xmath16 is the deepest one , particularly at lower @xmath17 . because the star is a relatively rapid rotator ( @xmath18 km / s ) , we have considered the possibility that the mode is an @xmath19 and 2 combination resulting from the rotatational coupling .",
    "we found , however , that at no inclination is the @xmath20 value as low as at a single @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the latter identification is most likely .    in the right panel",
    "we show a comparison of the @xmath1 values inferred from observations for @xmath14 cas with the theoretical values calculated with the five indicated values of the mlt parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the observed values of @xmath21 are closer to those calculated with @xmath22 , however values of @xmath23 require rather higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "+    * 20 cvn * : 20 cvn is a @xmath0 scuti variable regarded to be monoperiodic with a metal abundance of [ m / h]=0.5 @xmath24 . for models on the edges of the error box at @xmath25 ,",
    "the minimum of the @xmath4 is clearly at @xmath26 .",
    "having such a mode identification we can refine stellar parameters by fitting them to reproduce the observed period .    in the hr diagram , shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 , we plot the error box and the lines of the constant period for radial orders @xmath27 at @xmath25",
    ". only models along these lines are allowed .",
    "we cas see that we have two possibilities : @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "the models yielding the lowest @xmath4 are those marked with numbers 1 and 3 , both equally probable . in the case of @xmath30",
    "only @xmath29 is allowed , but the @xmath4 is much higher .",
    "thus from our method we have also some constraints on metallicity . in the right panel",
    "we compare the empirical and theoretical values of the @xmath1 parameter for models corresponding to the deepest @xmath4 minima .",
    "the positions are qualitatively similar to those in @xmath14 cas , but considerably higher as a consequence of higher radial order .",
    "* 1 mon * : 1 mon has three almost equally distant frequencies . here",
    "we present results for the dominant mode . in the left panel of fig .",
    "5 we show @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 obtained from @xmath13 photometry , for the models on the edges of error box .    in the right panel",
    "we have the same , but after including data on radial velocity changes .",
    "discrimination is now much better .",
    "especially the higher values of @xmath2 and some sets of stellar parameters are clearly excluded .",
    "the empirical values of the @xmath1 parameter are now very close to those calculated with @xmath31 .",
    "we obtained @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we have argued that multi - colour photometry of @xmath0 scuti stars may give us useful information not only about the excited modes but also about stars themselves .",
    "we believe that the most interesting is the prospect of probing the efficiency of convective transport in outer layers .",
    "we also showed that inferrence on mode degree and stellar properties is much improved by supplementing photometric data with radial velocity measurements .",
