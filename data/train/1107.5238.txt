    "extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics could either add new particles or representations , or extend the gauge sector .",
    "the enormous precision with which the sm has been tested in the last decades , plus the various theoretical consistency conditions which have to be obeyed , require careful addition of new physics .",
    "one particularly popular approach is the addition of an abelian gauge symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "if this symmetry is broken ( to avoid an additional force with infinite range ) , a massive @xmath3 boson is present , with model - dependent mass and couplings to the sm particles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on one class of highly interesting @xmath6 models : within the particle content of the sm , it is possible to gauge one of the three differences of lepton flavors @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath0 , without introducing an anomaly @xcite .",
    "this surprising feature has lead to a number of works analyzing the consequences of one of those broken symmetries @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 should be preferred over the other two combinations , because in the limit of conserved symmetry , the neutrino mass matrix is automatically @xmath1-@xmath2 symmetric , and predicts one degenerate neutrino pair .",
    "the necessary breaking of the symmetry will split their masses and generate small departures from @xmath1-@xmath2 symmetry , thereby rendering the neutrino phenomenology in agreement with data .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath7 or @xmath8 are to be gauged , the neutrino mass matrix has in the symmetry limit a structure far away from the one necessary to reproduce the experimental results .",
    "this intimate connection of flavor and gauge symmetry is rather unique .",
    "it is worth stressing that gauged @xmath0 gives a lepton mixing structure close to observation without the usual complications of flavor symmetries ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , in which one typically involves nonrenormalizable terms including a plethora of `` flavon fields '' , arranges for their proper vacuum expectation value ( vev ) alignment by additional input , and adds additional symmetries to avoid unwanted terms in the lagrangian .",
    "an important property of gauged @xmath0 is that it does not act on first - generation leptons , but only on muons and tauons . in this respect ,",
    "further motivation for this model ( and the main focus of previous discussions of this gauge group  @xcite ) stems from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "this measured quantity exhibits a @xmath10 difference to the theoretically predicted value , which can be explained by the loop - contribution of a heavy @xmath11 gauge boson .    in the present work we study the phenomenology of gauged @xmath9 in the regime in which the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is explained . in section  [ sec : gauge_sector ]",
    "we determine the currently allowed parameter space for a generic @xmath12 as determined by electroweak precision data , and also comment on collider physics aspects of heavy @xmath3 bosons .",

    "<S> the extension of the standard model by a spontaneously broken abelian gauge group based on the @xmath0 lepton number can resolve the long - standing discrepancy between experimental and theoretical values for the magnetic moment of the muon . </S>",
    "<S> it furthermore naturally generates @xmath1-@xmath2 symmetric lepton mixing , introduces neutrino nonstandard interactions , and the associated gauge boson @xmath3 serves as a mediator to the right - handed neutrino sector . a detailed fit to electroweak data </S>",
    "<S> is performed to identify the allowed values for the mass of @xmath3 and its mixing with the standard model @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> an economical new scalar sector is constructed that spontaneously breaks @xmath0 and leads to experimental consequences such as lepton flavor violation and collider signatures . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we discuss the nonabelian extension to an @xmath5 , particularly the neutrino sector .    </S>",
