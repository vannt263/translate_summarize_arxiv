    "ngc3783 is a bright seyfert  1 galaxy in which its x - ray spectrum shows some of the strongest absorption features around 0.71.5 kev .",
    "studies by _ rosat _ @xcite and _ asca _ ( e.g. ,",
    "@xcite and references therein ) have shown that the 210 kev continuum is fitted by a power law with photon index @xmath31.8 , the 210 kev flux varies in the range @xmath4@xmath5  ergs@xmath6s@xmath2 , and its mean x - ray luminosity is @xmath7  ergs s@xmath2 ( for @xmath8  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the absorption features are attributed to ovii and oviii edges and their models indicate a column density of ionized gas of @xmath10  @xmath6 .    on 2000 january 21 ngc3783 was observed with the high - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) on the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) as the detector .",
    "this spectrum shows several dozen absorption lines and a few emission lines from the h - like and he - like ions of o , ne , mg , si , and s as well as from fexvii ",
    "fexxiii l - shell transitions .",
    "the absorption lines are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by @xmath11 kms@xmath2 while the emission lines are consistent with being at the systemic velocity @xcite .",
    "high - resolution uv spectra of ngc3783 taken with _",
    "show intrinsic absorption features due to civ , nv and hi ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "currently there are three known absorption systems in the uv at radial velocities of @xmath12560 , @xmath13720 , and @xmath131400 kms@xmath2 ( blueshifted ) relative to the optical redshift .",
    "the strength of the absorption in the uv and in the x - ray bands , is found to be variable over time scales of months to years .",
    "the above characteristics have made ngc3783 to be a perfect target for an intensive study of the ionized gas in its nuclear environment .",
    "this multiwavelength monitoring study was carried out during 2001 february",
    " june by _",
    "chandra_/hetgs , _ rxte _ , _",
    "hst_/stis , _ fuse _ , and a ground based observatory .",
    "chandra_/hetgs observations consist of five observations each of @xmath14170 ks and adding the initial 56 ks the total exposure time ( ontime ) is 900.1  ks ( total of good time interval corrected for detector dead time is 888.7  ks ) . in this contribution we will present the mean 900 ks _ chandra_/hetgs x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 .",
    "we will focus on the fek@xmath0 region where a broad line , modeled as an emission line from accretion disk , was detected in _",
    "asca _ observations from 1996 .",
    "the detailed _ chandra_/hetgs spectra and analysis will be presented in kaspi et al .",

    "_ hst_/stis and _ fuse _ observations will be presented in crenshaw et al .",

    "all _ chandra_/hetgs observations were reduced uniformly and in the standard way using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( version 2.1.2 ) , and its calibration database ( version  2.6 ) . the mean 900 ks spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ specfig ] .",
    "about 150 line features can be identified in the spectrum ; many of these are blends of several lines .",
    "we identify absorption lines from h - like and he - like ions of n , o , ne , mg , al , si , and s as well as absorption from lower - ionization ions such as sivii  sixii and sxii  sxiv . there are also many absorption lines from iron ions ; l - shell and m - shell lines of fexvii  fexxiv as well as probable resonance lines of fexxv",
    ". absorptions by c , ar , and ca are hinted , although these are not significant .",
    "-0.7 cm    focusing on the topic of this meeting , there are two regions were emission lines from accretion onto black holes are expected : the fek@xmath0 line at 6.4 kev which will be discussed in the next section , and the soft x - ray emission lines from a relativistic accretion disk recently suggested to be present in the narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies mcg@xmath136 - 30 - 15 and mrk766 using _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "these are ly@xmath0 lines from oviii , nvii , and cvi which are broadened by relativistic effects in the accretion disk and appear in the spectrum as broad saw - toothed features around 1735   . when binning the 900 ks x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 to _ xmm_/rgs resolution , it has adequate signal - to - noise ratio up to about 27   .",
    "examination of this part of the spectrum reveals no such features as identified in mcg@xmath136 - 30 - 15 and mrk766 .",
    "preliminary model for the data , based on the multi - component , outflowing , photoionized absorber model presented in @xcite , fits the 900  ks spectrum over the whole 0.510 kev band , with no need to invoke the relativistic accretion disk lines .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray spectrum of ngc3783 shows a prominent narrow fek@xmath0 emission line . a gaussian fitted to the 0.0025  binned spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ feplot]b ) gives a central wavelength of @xmath15    ( @xmath16  ev ) which is consistent with the fek@xmath0 line from fei to fexi .",
    "interestingly , the fek@xmath0 line in fig .",
    "[ feplot]b shows two peaks ( though these are not significantly resolved ) which are consistent with the two expected fek@xmath0 lines for fei , k@xmath17 at 1.936  (6403.84 ev ) and k@xmath18 at 1.940    ( 6390.84 ev ) , with a branching ratio of 2:1 .",
    "we fitted the heg spectrum with two gaussians fixed at the wavelengths of fek@xmath0 lines and with the same branching ratio .",
    "we find the fwhm of the gaussians to be @xmath19  m  and , when taking into account the instrumental fwhm of 12  m , we get a true fwhm of @xmath20  m .",
    "this fwhm corresponds to @xmath1 kms@xmath2 at the wavelength of the fek@xmath0 line ( fitting the data with only one gaussian yields a consistent result , @xmath21 kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "if we assume the very simple assumption that the gas around the central mass is moving as a virialized system than there is a simple anticorrelation of the line width with the radial location of its origin . since the broad lines in ngc3783 has line widths of order 4000 kms@xmath2 and the narrow lines has line widths of order 500 kms@xmath2 , the resolved line width of the narrow fek@xmath0 line suggests an origin in between the blr and the nlr . within the frame of agns unified models",
    "this is consistent with an emission from the torus .",
    "indeed , the fek@xmath0 narrow line equivalent width ( @xmath22  m  = @xmath23  ev ) and flux ( @xmath24\\times10^{-5}\\ { \\rm photons\\ cm^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$ ] ) are consistent with models predicting emission from the torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the narrow fek@xmath0 line seems to have a red wing extending to @xmath25    ( @xmath26  kev ) .",
    "we tentatively identify this red wing as the `` compton shoulder '' produced by compton scattering in optically - thick cold matter which can be identified with the obscuring torus .",
    "the shoulder extends from 6.2 to 6.4  kev , has a total flux of @xmath27 , and its ew is @xmath28 m .",
    "these numbers are in agreement with previous models and observations of such a shoulder ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have looked for a broad component for the fe  k@xmath0 line by fitting an absorbed power - law continuum to the energy range 2.510  kev ( excluding the 57 kev range and several narrow absorption lines ) and modeling the fe  k@xmath0 line with a narrow gaussian plus a `` disk - line '' component for a schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we do not find a broad component in the 900 ks _",
    "chandra_/hetgs spectrum ( see fig .  [ femodel ] ) and we are only able to place an upper limit on its intensity to be @xmath29 ( ew @xmath30  ev ) .    -0.9 cm    -0.5",
    "cm    -0.9 cm    -0.4 cm    in _ asca _ observations carried out in 1996 the fe  k@xmath0 line is modeled with a broad component with an intensity of @xmath31 and a narrow component with an intensity of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "while the narrow component flux is consistent with the current measurement , the upper limit we set for the broad component indicates that its flux decreased by a factor of at least three between the 1996 observations and the 2000/2001 observations .",
    "other line models , which are still need to be constrained , will be presented in kaspi et al .",
