    "new weakly interacting massive particles  ( wimps ) with masses in the order of @xmath3  gev are predicted by several extensions to the sm of particle physics . with their weak strength interactions ,",
    "these particles are natural candidates for the observed abundance of cosmological dark matter  ( dm ) .",
    "if these particles were produced at colliders , they would leave the detector invisibly without any further interaction .",
    "their parameters could be inferred indirectly by the analysis of cascade decays if other new particles exist in the kinematically accessible mass range .",
    "alternatively the direct pair production of wimps with associated initial state radiation @xmath4 can be employed to determine the wimp properties from the observed photon spectrum .",
    "it has to be noted , that even if the detection via cascade decays is possible , the single photon plus missing energy signature provides an additional measurement of the wimp candidate .",
    "the rate of radiative wimp production at an @xmath5 collider can be estimated model - independent without any assumptions on the dynamics of the interaction involved  @xcite . with only one new stable particle responsible for the observed dm content in the universe",
    ", the production cross section for wimp pairs with associated isr can be written in the limit of non - relativistic final state wimps as : @xmath6 with the candidate mass @xmath7 , the candidate spin @xmath8 and the center - of - mass energy squared @xmath9 . the double differential cross section is expressed in the dimensionless variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the emitted photon . in equation",
    "[ eqn : wimp ] , @xmath12 is the quantum number of the dominant partial wave in the production process . in the following , we will refer to the cases of @xmath13 ( s - wave ) and @xmath14 ( p - wave ) production only .",
    "the quantitiy @xmath15 is the `` annihilation fraction '' of wimps into electrons .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 provides the overall scale of the production cross section and can be inferred from observation when the wimp is identified with the cosmological dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the annihilation fraction @xmath15 implicitely depends on the helicity of the initial state electrons . for our analysis",
    "we investigated the following three coupling scenarios@xcite :    * * `` equal '' * : the wimp couplings are independent of the helicity of the incoming electrons and positrons , i.e.  @xmath17 . *",
    "* `` helicity '' * : the couplings conserve helicity and parity , + @xmath18 ; @xmath19 . *",
    "* `` anti - sm '' * : this scenario is a `` best case '' scenario , since the wimps couple only to right - handed electrons and left - handed positrons : @xmath20 .",
    "this `` single photon plus missing energy signature '' has standard model  ( sm ) processes with large cross sections for background , the dominant one being radiative neutrino production @xmath21 , which proceeds for high center - of - mass energies primarily via t - channel @xmath22 exchange and hence is strongly polarisation dependent .",
    "in addition other sm processes like radiative bhabha scattering @xmath23 or multi - photon final states can mimic the wimp production signature when the accompanying electrons or photons leave the detector through the beam pipe , or are not properly reconstructed .",
    "polarised beams can be used to significantly reduce these backgrounds and increase the s / b ratio@xcite , but the still large abundance of background events requires a consideration of sytematic uncertainties from the detector measurement and beam parameters .",
    "to cover a broad range of parameters in terms of candidate masses , partial waves and coupling structures , only the sm background has been generated and simulated explicitly .",
    "the signal contribution to the data is obtained by reweighting the irreducible sm @xmath24 background , which is indistinguishable from the signal on an event - by - event basis , with the cross section ratio @xmath25 of radiative wimp and neutrino pair production .",
    "the weights are evaluated in terms of the mc photon energy .",
    "the measurement of the wimp parameters requires a precise prediction of the sm background photon distributions .",
    "the expectation is generated by a parametrization of an independent background subsample , by succesively correcting the sm prediction for the detector energy resolution and selection efficiencies .",
    "remaining differences to the simulated detector output from the beam energy spectrum and unaccounted detector and reconstruction effects are parametrized with a higher order polynominal . from the parametrization of the @xmath24 spectra ,",
    "the signal prediction is generated@xcite .",
    "the background events have been generated using whizard  @xcite .",
    "the beam energy spectrum was provided by guinea pig  @xcite for the nominal rdr baseline parameter set for a @xmath26  gev machine@xcite .",
    "the simulation of the detector response was done for the ild detector concept  @xcite with the geant4  @xcite based simulation software mokka  @xcite .",
    "three statistically independent event samples of @xmath27 each have been generated and simulated for the dominant irreducible @xmath24 background .",
    "the first two samples are used for the background and signal contribution to the data , while the third sample serves as basis for the spectrum parametrization . in addition data samples with multi - photon final states",
    "@xmath28 and the bhabha background @xmath23 have been simulated . after event reconstruction using the pandora pfa  particle flow algorithm  @xcite two corrections to the reconstructed events have been applied .",
    "the reconstruction of high energy photons often results in several additional detections of lower energy photons , because the clustering stage of the pandora pfa  algorithm tends to split large energy depositions into several smaller distrinct electromagnetic clusters . to counter the effect of the cluster fracturing ,",
    "photon candidates are merged with a cone based method .",
    "second , the photon candidate energies have been recalibrated with a calibration function accounting for polar angle dependent fractional energy losses caused by the segmentation of the ild calorimeter system .      an event is considered signal - like , if it contains at least one high @xmath29 photon with an energy between 10  gev @xmath30 220  gev , and a polar angle constrained to @xmath31 .",
    "the condition on the photon energy reduces the abundant low energy isr from the sm background and excludes the massless neutrino final state on the radiative @xmath32 return at photon energies of @xmath33  gev . for further event selection ,",
    "additional constraints are set to deal with the dominant reducible sm backgrounds , especially radiative bhabha scattering and multi - photon final states . to exclude hadronic and leptonic final states , the maximal exclusive energy @xmath34 , i.e.  the full visible energy excluding the selected photon , is constrained to 20  gev .",
    "for further reduction of hadronic final states and bhabha events , the maximal allowed transverse track momentum is @xmath35  gev .",
    "the track momenta can not be constrained stronger , as the event selection has to allow for tracks of @xmath5 pairs from the beamstrahlung background and for track overlays of multi - peripheral @xmath36  hadrons events  ( collectively called @xmath37 processes ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ptbackground](a ) the momentum distribution of tracks per bunch crossing from the @xmath37 and beamstrahlung background are shown .",
    "on average 0.7 tracks from @xmath37 processes and 1.5 tracks from beamstrahlung are expected in each event .",
    "the distributions show a strong peak at low @xmath29 determined from the minimal momentum for the tracks to reach the tracking region of ild and fall of rapidly .",
    "only 0.2% of tracks have a transverse momentum above 3  gev .",
    "the selection efficieny of the @xmath24 background is on average above 85% , with higher efficiencies in the low energy part of the photon spectrum , where most of the wimp production signal is located .",
    "this higher efficiency for low energies translates to a signal selection efficiency well above 90% over the full mass range , see figure  [ fig : ptbackground](b ) .",

    "the polarisation measurement precision is assumed to @xmath38@xcite .",
    "the precision on the luminosity is given by the rdr  @xcite with @xmath39 .",
    "a further source of systematic error is given by the knowledge of the beam energy spectrum . here",
    ", its influence is conservately estimated from the impact on the signal spectrum for two different parameter sets , namely the nominal rdr and sb-2009  @xcite sets . for the cross section measurement which is not sensitive to the partial wave quantum number",
    ", the selection efficiency obtains an additional contribution of uncertainty from the difference between the selection efficiencies of s- and p - wave production .",
