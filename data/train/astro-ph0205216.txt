    "the standard model of structure formation ( lcdm ) is one in which the universe is dominated by cold , collisionless dark matter ( cdm ) , made flat by a cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) , and endowed with initial density perturbations via quantum fluctuations during inflation @xcite . although the need for the cosmological constant component is unexpected , the cdm+inflation paradigm is strongly motivated , and with the parameter choices @xmath12 , @xmath13 , lcdm can account for an impressive range of astronomical observations on large scales .",
    "however , on galactic scales , this model faces some potentially ruinous difficulties .",
    "perhaps the most troubling of these problems are the indications that the central regions of galaxies are noticeably less dense than the favored lcdm model typically predicts @xcite . in this paper",
    "we suggest that these observations might be telling us something fundamental about the epoch of inflation , and also explore how massive neutrinos affect halo densities .",
    "there are two related but distinct facets of the central density problem .",
    "the first problem concerns the fact that the integrated mass densities within well - defined central radii of observed galaxies ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : model ] ) seem to be a factor of @xmath14 larger than the central densities predicted by standard lcdm @xcite .",
    "the second , often referred to as the `` cuspy halo problem , '' highlights the fact that cdm halo density profiles are predicted to diverge at small r ( @xmath15 ) , while galaxy rotation curves are often better fit with constant density cores @xcite . while the second of these issues has received the most attention ,",
    "it is often degenerate with the first problem and is somewhat more controversial .",
    "for example , de blok and collaborators @xcite have argued that their sample of low - surface brightness galaxies favor fits to density profiles with a constant density central `` core '' over those with cusps ; however , van den bosch and swaters argue that a majority of galactic rotation curves are acceptably fit by divergent profiles as long as they are much less centrally concentrated than typical halos in standard lcdm @xcite . furthermore , _ all _ observational errors ( _ e.g. _ , slit offset ) tend to favor constant apparent central density over cusps . at present , it is not clear that the cuspy halo problem presents a serious challenge to lcdm , although it appears that the data do prefer halos that are less centrally concentrated than typical halos in the standard lcdm model .",
    "the problems with central densities have triggered a growing concern that we are missing something fundamental in our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "( this is in spite of the fact that some of the problematic claims are disputed @xcite . )",
    "solutions to the problems range from those that use baryonic physics @xcite to those that rely on altering the nature of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "while the astrophysical solutions are reasonably well - motivated , the fact that problems seem to exist for relatively small , dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies all the way to large ellipticals suggests that a single baryonic solution may not be able to address all of our concerns . the altered dark matter solutions , on the other hand , could possibly be made to match the range of observations , but only by invoking unmotivated or fine - tuned candidates ( there is no well - motivated warm dark matter candidate ) .",
    "our inflation - derived solution is nonastrophysical but works entirely within the desirable tenets of the cdm paradigm .",
    "this paper is conservative in that it concentrates on the integrated density within some well - defined radius , which is certainly more robustly determined in simulated halos than the central slope of the density profile . as we shall discuss below",
    ", the same is likely true for observed galaxies .",
    "our work is principally inspired by alam , bullock , and weinberg @xcite who suggested that the central density problem would be reduced significantly in lcdm if the initial inflationary power spectrum were tilted to favor large scales .",
    "the term `` tilted '' is defined in terms of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations , which we assume over some range in wave number @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 , corresponding to a mass variance per logarithmic interval of @xmath18 . tilted power spectra refer to those with @xmath19 . in `` standard '' lcdm",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath20 is exactly @xmath21 , corresponding to a scale invariant , harrison - zeldovich primordial power spectrum .",
    "this choice is often justified by the tendency for inflation models to predict _ nearly _ scale invariant spectra ; however , generic models of inflation do not predict primordial power spectra that are _ exactly _ scale invariant . as we discuss below",
    ", the central densities of dark halos are extremely sensitive to the amount of small - scale power and hence small deviations from scale invariance can be very important .",
    "our aim is to compute the predicted primordial @xmath22 for several example inflation models and apply these results to the question of galaxy central densities and concentrations .",
    "although similar in spirit to the agenda of kamionkowski and liddle @xcite , who suggested that the small - scale crisis might reflect a sharp feature in the inflationary power spectrum ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : bsi ] ) , our mind - set is to look at models that are not particularly fine - tuned .",
    "we simply choose fairly representative , simple , single field inflationary models and we examine a range of predicted power spectra , even one with with a `` blue '' initial spectrum ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "in the context of slow roll inflation , models that predict significant tilt generally yield effective spectral indices that are strongly scale - dependent or exhibit significant `` running '' of the spectral index .",
    "consequently , when comparing observational data that span a wide range of scales ( @xmath24 in this case ) it makes sense to account for the variation of @xmath25 with scale in addition to the so - called `` tilt '' of the spectrum .",
    "we account for the running of the spectral index by calculating it in specific inflationary models and show that the running can have an important effect on structure on galactic scales .",
    "we also estimate the effect of a `` hot dark matter '' component in the form of massive neutrinos on the central densities of dark matter halos .",
    "we make our estimates for halo densities using a semi - analytic model normalized against n - body simulations .",
    "the model relies on our , now well - founded , understanding that halo central densities are determined by their collapse histories @xcite .",
    "although we examine models with varying amounts of small - scale power , we are not free to alter the spectrum by an arbitrary amount .",
    "the amplitude of power on small ( @xmath26 ) scales is often quantified in terms of @xmath27 , which is the rms overdensity smoothed with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath28 .",
    "observationally , this quantity can be determined in a number of ways including techniques that rely on the abundance of rich x - ray clusters , the cosmic shear from weak gravitational lensing , and galactic peculiar velocity flows . however , these estimates do not converge on a definitive value ( even when the same method is used by different authors ) and many recent estimates seem to advocate surprisingly low values of @xmath27 @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "recent estimates yield values that span the range @xmath29 for @xmath30 . in the following , we will only consider models with @xmath31 because models with a smaller @xmath27 do not have a good chance of being able to match observations . we acknowledge that even this limit is pushing the observational bounds ( although it is consistent with ref .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "sec : con ] .    throughout this work",
    "we will assume @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "it is widely believed that the primordial density perturbations that led to the growth of structure in the universe were produced during inflation : quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field were frozen in as the rapid cosmological expansion stretched these fluctuations to length scales larger than the horizon .",
    "the power spectrum of primordial perturbations can be calculated via the slow roll approximation ( for a review , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the standard calculation , to lowest order in slow roll , yields expressions for the spectrum of density perturbations at horizon crossing ,    [ eq : deltah ] _",
    "h^2(k ) , and the effective spectral index of the primordial spectrum , [ eq : spectind ] n(k ) 1 + 2- 6 in terms of the inflaton potential @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and the slow roll parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the reduced planck mass is defined in terms of newton s constant as @xmath42 gev and , as usual , these expressions are to be evaluated at horizon crossing ( when @xmath43 ) .",
    "in the limit of exact de sitter space during inflation , the predicted primordial power spectrum would approach exact scale invariance ; however , any model in which a scalar field is slowly rolling towards a minimum of its potential will predict some deviation from @xmath0 .",
    "of course , in the context of some inflationary models , the deviation is quite small , and scale invariance is a reasonable approximation .",
    "one frequently cited example of this sort is power - law inflation , for which there is an exact solution @xcite .",
    "the reason why approximate scale invariance is expected in this model has to do with estimates of the gravitational wave contribution to the cmb quadrupole .",
    "in addition to scalar density fluctuations , inflation also produces tensor ( gravity wave ) fluctuations . in the power - law inflation case ,",
    "the ratio of the tensor to scalar contribution to the cmb quadrupole , @xmath44 , increases with the tilt as @xmath45 .",
    "a similar result also applies to chaotic inflation models ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) because @xmath46 in these models .",
    "recent cmb measurements indicate that the tensor contribution is small ( @xmath47 @xcite ) so power - law inflation requires @xmath48",
    ".    however , this case does not exemplify general inflationary predictions .",
    "tensor perturbations can be negligible even if the tilt is not .",
    "this is because the tensor wave amplitude depends only on the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the gravity wave contribution is negligible if the inflaton field remains far below the planck scale , as would be expected in well - motivated models such as the running - mass case discussed below .",
    "models meeting this requirement can naturally produce modest tilts and spectral index running .",
    "moreover , there are reasonably well - motivated cases that can yield dramatic departures from scale invariance .    in the balance of this section",
    ", we briefly outline the predictions of several models of inflation that lead to deviations from the standard @xmath0 , scale invariant primordial spectrum and present the @xmath49 linear power spectra in each case . included in this set of models",
    "is a more extreme example that exhibits so - called `` broken scale invariance '' and for which the slow roll approximation can not be used . in all other cases ,",
    "we calculate the primordial power spectrum to second order in slow roll using the method of stewart and gong @xcite which is sufficiently accurate for our purposes @xcite . in this way",
    ", we take into account both the tilt of the power spectrum and the running of the spectral index .",
    "to derive the low - redshift power spectra , we use the fitting form for the transfer function given by eisenstein and hu @xcite and the exact relation for the linear growth factor in flat cosmologies with a cosmological constant given by bildhauer , buchert , and kasai @xcite . in all cases",
    "we normalize the power spectrum to cobe using the fitting functions of bunn , liddle and white @xcite .",
    "we consider several models in which the effective spectral index varies significantly with scale . in these cases",
    ", we follow the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite and evaluate the normalization at the scale @xmath50 h mpc@xmath51 , which is approximately the pivot scale of the cobe data , using the effective spectral index at that scale , @xmath52 .",
    "we begin with the illustrative example of the inverted power law ( ipl ) potential ( or `` small field polynomial '' in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which has the basic characteristics of `` new inflation '' @xcite .",
    "the general form is    [ eq : ipl ] = v_0(1-c^p ) with @xmath53 .",
    "this potential implies that the effective spectral index of the primordial power spectrum on the scale @xmath54 is given by    [ eq : n_ipl ] n(k _ * ) 1 - 2 ( ) , where @xmath55 is the number of e - folds of inflation that occur between the epoch when the scale @xmath54 leaves the horizon and the end of inflation . we can obtain a rough estimate of @xmath55 in terms of the energy density at reheating , @xmath56 , the value of the inflaton potential when @xmath54 leaves the horizon , @xmath57 , and the value of the inflaton potential at the end of inflation , @xmath58 , by assuming instantaneous transitions between vacuum domination and matter domination at the end of inflation and matter domination and radiation domination at reheating",
    "this gives    [ eq : nstar ] n _ * 57 - ( ) + ( ) . if the details of the end of inflation and the process of reheating were known , @xmath55 would be known precisely ; however , these details are not known .",
    "in order to obtain definite predictions , we take @xmath59 which is a fairly standard working hypothesis . using this in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_ipl ] ) , we see that with @xmath60 ( we refer to this model as ipl4 ) this model predicts mild deviation from scale invariance , namely @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , the spectral index is mildly scale - dependent , @xmath62 .",
    "figure 1 depicts a typical power spectrum at @xmath49 with the choice @xmath60 . rather than @xmath22 or @xmath63 , we plot the rms overdensity on a given mass scale @xmath64 , because this is the relevant quantity for our subsequent calculations . the cobe normalization amounts to choosing a suitable combination of @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the effective spectral index is insensitive to this choice .",
    "normalized to cobe , this model predicts a perfectly acceptable value of @xmath67 . corresponds to a mass scale of @xmath68 h@xmath51 under the assumption that @xmath33 . ]    before proceeding , we mention that the particle physics motivation for this type of potential may be somewhat dubious . in particular , if @xmath60 , cobe normalization requires the dimensionless @xmath69 coupling constant to be of order @xmath70 ( the fine - tuning problem may be obviated by considering the coupling to be a parameter of an effective field theory rather than a fundamental parameter ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we consider this to be a good illustrative example because it is simple and has the general behavior @xmath71 that is exhibited by a wide variety of models including many specific incarnations of new inflation @xcite , hybrid inflation and mutated hybrid inflation @xcite , as well as models with a variable gravitational constant @xcite . in addition , this potential mimics the potential encountered in a particular variation of mutated hybrid inflation known as `` smooth '' hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "stewart has proposed a model in which the need to fine - tune the inflaton mass in order for inflation to occur in the context of supergravity is eliminated by a `` flattening '' of the effective inflaton potential due to loop corrections @xcite .",
    "this provides a natural mechanism for generating a potential that gives rise to inflation .",
    "interestingly , the resulting effective potential can lead to a spectral index considerably different from @xmath0 and with a significant scale dependence . in this model",
    "it is assumed that in the sector of the inflaton field , supersymmetry is broken explicitly during inflation and the scalar fields have soft supersymmetry - breaking mass terms as would generally be the case . through couplings to fields with soft supersymmetry - breaking masses , the scalar field masses may get important renormalization corrections .",
    "the one - loop correction to the inflaton potential then gives an effective potential with a running inflaton mass ,    [ eq : rmpot ] v_0 + m^2()^2 +  , where the ellipsis represents nonrenormalizable terms that become important at the planck scale .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is tied to the scale of the supersymmetry breaking during inflation , @xmath72 .",
    "this type of model has been discussed extensively by covi , lyth and roszkowski @xcite and covi and lyth @xcite who derived cosmic microwave background constraints on such models .",
    "inflation occurs in the vicinity of an extremum of the potential and the established blueprint for analyzing inflation in the context of this model is to assume that @xmath73 can be approximated by a function that is linear in @xmath74 while cosmological scales are leaving the horizon @xcite . in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite , the effective potential is then written as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmpot ] ) with @xmath75 and the spectral index in this case is given by    [ eq : rm_n ] n(k _ * ) 1 + 2e^-cn _ * - 2c where",
    "@xmath76 is chosen such that @xmath77 and @xmath66 and @xmath78 are parameters that may be either positive or negative and we generally expect that @xmath79 @xcite . with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we have the particularly interesting case that @xmath82 and decreases with increasing @xmath16 . with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath23 and decreases with scale .",
    "we use such a model in several places to illustrate the predictions of a model with a primordial power spectrum that has @xmath23 . for reasonable parameter choices there may be a significant tilt and",
    "the scale dependence may be as strong as @xmath85 on cosmologically interesting scales .",
    "the significant running of the tilt is not surprising . as we stated earlier , in the context of slow roll inflation , models with significant tilts",
    "typically exhibit strong variation of @xmath20 with scale .",
    "the cobe normalization is related to the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath86 . in each case",
    "we make physically reasonable choices of these parameters to enforce the cobe normalization ( see ref .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is relatively insensitive to these choices .",
    "we choose this model as a simple example of an inflationary model that may _ naturally _ predict significant deviations from @xmath0 and running of the spectral index .    in fig .",
    "1 we show present - day , linear power spectra for two particular choices of parameters .",
    "the model with @xmath23 ( rm @xmath23 ) has parameter choices @xmath87 and @xmath88 , resulting in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and is shown largely for illustration ( note that in this case a hybrid mechanism is necessary to end inflation ) . the more interesting case with @xmath82 ( rm @xmath82 ) has parameter choices @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for this model , @xmath93 and @xmath94 which is consistent with constraints on tilt from various analyses of cmb , large - scale structure and ly@xmath95 forest data @xcite . for this model @xmath96 which is on the low side of our acceptable range .",
    "in contrast with the above models , there may be a feature at some scale in the inflationary potential that causes the power to drop abruptly .",
    "this possibility leads us to consider models with so - called `` broken scale invariant '' ( bsi ) spectra . in these models",
    ", there is a critical scale @xmath97 , and for @xmath98 and @xmath99 the primordial power spectrum has an effective power law index @xmath100 .",
    "however , on scales near the critical scale the amplitude of the initial density perturbations changes abruptly so that the power on scales @xmath101 can be significantly less than that on scales @xmath102 .",
    "this type of spectrum may arise in models in which more than one field plays an important role in inflation while cosmological scales are leaving the horizon @xcite but placing the scale @xmath97 in an observationally interesting range usually introduces a fine - tuning issue .    as an idealized case of bsi",

    "this is a useful model to study for two reasons .",
    "first , the primordial power spectrum can be written in a relatively simple closed form .",

    "note , however , that halos formed within hot + cold dark matter simulations do seem to follow an nfw profile down to @xmath159 of the halo virial radius @xcite .",
    "ideally , our results will motivate future work using n - body simulations in order to test our preliminary conclusions .",
    "briefly , the model of bullock @xcite ( and nfw ) embodies the fact that we expect the central densities of dark matter halos to reflect the mean density of the universe at a time when the central region of the halo was accreting matter at a high rate @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect halos with central regions that collapsed earlier to be denser than their late - forming counterparts . accordingly , our first step is to assign an epoch of collapse to a halo via the prescription that , at the collapse epoch @xmath160 , the typical collapsing mass , @xmath161 , is equal to some fixed fraction of the halo s virial mass .",
    "explicitly , we define    [ eq : coll ] f. @xmath162 is the mass scale at which the rms density fluctuation is equal to the equivalent linear overdensity at collapse , @xmath163 . if @xmath164 is the rms overdensity on mass scale @xmath165 at redshift @xmath140 [ we use @xmath64 with no redshift argument to denote @xmath166 as usual ] , then the collapse criterion can be written as @xmath167 .",
    "notice that this definition of the epoch of collapse differs from that of nfw who defined the collapse epoch using the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "this is the key difference that gives the improved model the ability to trace the redshift dependence of the @xmath168 relationship .",
    "@xmath169 is a free parameter and bullock found that the model is in good agreement with the results of n - body simulations if @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "the small value of the parameter @xmath169 is not surprising .",
    "the densities that characterize the very central regions of halos are determined by the power on scales much smaller than the size of the halo , scales that broke away from the expansion at a much earlier time than the mass scale @xmath135 .",
    "it is already evident that the central densities of dark matter halos will be very sensitive to @xmath64 on small scales and hence , to the slope of the primordial power spectrum or the presence of hot dark matter . at early times",
    "( but during matter domination ) , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "thus the epoch of collapse varies approximately as @xmath173 .",
    "if the central densities do , in fact , reflect the mean density of the universe at the epoch of collapse then , roughly speaking , we expect @xmath174 so that a change in power by a factor of @xmath175 will lead to a change in central density by a factor @xmath176 [ eq . ( [ eq : dv2nfw ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cvir ] ) below ] .",
    "the second step is to relate the mass density of the universe at @xmath160 to a characteristic halo density today .",
    "bullock chose to use @xmath177 defined by    [ eq : rhodef ] ^3 .",
    "for an nfw profile , @xmath178 . introducing the free parameter @xmath179",
    ", we associate @xmath177 with the universal density at collapse via    [ eq : kden ] = k^3(z=0)_m(1+z_c)^3 . solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rhodef ] ) and ( [ eq : kden ] ) for @xmath157 gives    [ eq : cvir ] ( ) = k(1+z_c ( ) ) .",
    "agreement with n - body simulations fixes @xmath180 .",
    "bullock and wechsler claim that the @xmath181 scatter in the @xmath182 relation is roughly @xmath183 while jing has argued for a somewhat smaller scatter given by @xmath184 at @xmath181 @xcite .    with this model in place",
    ", we can use the linear power spectra of the previous two sections to predict @xmath157 and , more practically , @xmath3 and compare them with observation .",
    "in this section we compare the predictions of the previous models with data on the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "we concentrate our discussion on galaxies with both hi and h@xmath95 data or hi data that has been corrected for the effects of beam smearing .",
    "the data we use are taken from the recent works of swaters @xcite ( mass modeling of these galaxies was performed by van den bosch and swaters @xcite ) de blok , mcgaugh and rubin @xcite and de blok and bosma @xcite who combined previous hi measurements @xcite with high - resolution h@xmath95 measurements .",
    "we use these data to derive observational estimates of @xmath3 for comparison with the theoretical predictions . for the data of de blok and bosma @xcite",
    ", we use their best fitting model for the dark matter distribution of each galaxy in the absence of baryons to derive estimates for @xmath3 . for the data of swaters @xcite and de blok , mcgaugh , and rubin @xcite , we fit the raw data to the velocity profile proposed by kravtsov @xcite , [ eq : kkbp ] v_c(r ) = v_c^0 , and use the best fitting models to estimate @xmath3 . the profile in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkbp ] ) has the practical advantage that it parameterizes the sharpness of the transition between the two power laws at large and small radii .",
    "hence the fitted value of the effective power law index at small radii is to some degree decoupled from the details of the rotation curve at @xmath185 .",
    "this added versatility makes it a very useful and accurate formula for describing observed rotation curves at small radii .",
    "our estimates of @xmath3 are robust in that for most galaxies in the above samples , the inferred values of @xmath3 change by less than 40% if we instead fit the data with nfw , pseudoisothermal or burkert @xcite density profiles . from one profile to the next .",
    "however , moore profiles tend to fit the data more poorly , and give larger variation in the implied @xmath3 .",
    "this is similar to the result found by van den bosch and swaters @xcite . ]",
    "the robustness of the central density parameter is yet another advantage of using @xmath3 as a diagnostic of the central densities of dark matter halos .",
    "any comparison of the predictions of n - body simulations or semi - analytic calculations that model the behavior of cdm with data rests on some assumptions about the physics of baryon infall . in making this comparison , we believe that our methods are conservative in the sense that we likely overestimate @xmath3 based on the observational data in order to give the data every opportunity to match theoretical predictions ( including the scale invariant `` standard model '' ) .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to dwarf and lsb galaxies which are generally believed to be dominated by their dark matter components @xcite . in so doing , we hope that any effects of baryonic infall are mitigated but recognize the fact that we may be introducing a heretofore unappreciated selection effect .",
    "second , we calculate @xmath3 based on the full rotation curve without mass modeling or baryon subtraction .",
    "we therefore overestimate the central density of the primordial dark matter halo because the cooling and contraction of the baryons likely lead to contraction of the dark matter component as well ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , although also see ref .",
    "third , the measured rotation curves of about 20% of the galaxies in the sample may not extend out to large enough radii for an accurate determination of @xmath153 and consequently @xmath153 may be significantly underestimated for several galaxies . in these cases , we simply take the last point in the rotation curve as an estimate of @xmath153 . by examining eq .",
    "( [ eq : dv2def ] ) it is easy to see that if @xmath186 with @xmath187 at small radii , an _ underestimation _ of @xmath153 by a factor @xmath188 leads to an _ overestimation _ of @xmath3 by a factor of @xmath189 ( clearly , for @xmath190 , corresponding to a constant density core , the error cancels exactly ) .",
    "in other words , the error introduced has the net effect of bringing theory and observation closer together .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvirs ] , we show the theoretical predictions for the concentration parameter @xmath157 in the context of our inflationary models .",
    "figure [ fig : cvirs_nu ] shows the predictions in scenarios with massive neutrinos .",
    "notice the wide swath of the @xmath182 plane that is carved out by the various models and , in particular , that @xmath157 can be reduced by a factor of two or more by adopting primordial power spectra predicted by reasonable models of inflation or by adding neutrino masses that are not ruled out by observation or experiment .",
    "dark matter halos may be significantly less concentrated than standard lcdm plus scale invariance predicts .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath182 relation is not directly observable and , what is more , it is defined in terms of a particular density profile . to connect theory with observations ,",
    "we compare the quantity @xmath3 , as a measure of inner halo concentration , to @xmath153 as a measure of the absolute size of the halo . for an nfw profile",
    ", @xmath153 is related to @xmath135 through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mvir ] ) and ( [ eq : nfwvmax ] ) .",
    "the results of this comparison are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dvcomp ] and [ fig : dvcomp_nu ] .",
    "first , consider the predictions of the various models of inflation . although the agreement or disagreement of a particular model with the data is hard to quantify",
    ", it is not surprising that the running mass model with @xmath23 is effectively ruled out by the data .",
    "more interestingly , we find that in agreement with previous studies @xcite , the @xmath0 scale invariant spectrum also has difficulty reproducing the observed galactic central densities .",
    "this is a restatement of the problem : _ if we are not preferentially selecting low density galaxies by restricting attention to low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies , then some additional physics is needed to reconcile the standard model of cdm plus scale invariant primordial spectrum with the observed central densities of dark matter - dominated galaxies_. ipl4 does a somewhat better job of matching the data but the moderate tilt and spectral index running in this model are likely not sufficient to bring theory and observation together . for bsi , the agreement is much better but note that it is difficult to lower the theoretical @xmath3 values further by adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    "increasing @xmath108 , the ratio of power on scales @xmath191 to power on scales @xmath192 , does not do much to help the bsi model come closer to matching the data because the fluctuation amplitude can not drop quickly enough to produce a significant decrease in @xmath64 on scales of interest .",
    "meanwhile , we can not decrease @xmath97 much further without threatening the success of the standard model on large scales .",
    "notice that the running - mass model with @xmath82 ( rm @xmath82 ) is a relatively good match to the median of the data in the @xmath193 plane ( perhaps even undershooting the median ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this agreement has come without the need to saturate our lower bounds on spectral tilt from cmb and large scale structure ( @xmath194 , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) or our lower limit on @xmath27 .",
    "the central densities of dark matter halos are very sensitive to the initial power spectrum and it seems as though the predicted central densities of dark matter halos in a lcdm cosmology may be reduced to acceptable levels by invoking simple and well - motivated models of inflation with @xmath195 and/or a running spectral index .",
    "likewise , in the case of massive neutrinos , we see that by saturating our lower bound on @xmath27 , we can reduce the predicted median value of @xmath3 to observationally acceptable levels .",
    "it seems that three massive neutrinos with @xmath196 can decrease small - scale power enough to provide a pretty good match to the values of @xmath3 inferred from rotation curve data .",
    "the central density problem is one of several difficulties confronting the standard paradigm of structure formation . in this paper",
    "we explored solutions that do not invoke uncertain baryonic physics but preserve the cold and collisionless properties of the dark matter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we showed that models of inflation that predict moderate , yet observationally acceptable tilts , @xmath197 , may provide an acceptable solution to the central density problem .",
    "these tilts are consistent with the latest constraints from joint analyses of cmb anisotropy , large - scale structure and ly@xmath95 forest data @xcite .",
    "moreover , these tilts can be produced in well - motivated models of inflation .",
    "in fact , we worked in the context of specific models throughout this paper and in so doing , we were able to take into account the important effect of the running of the spectral index . to illustrate the importance of the running",
    ", we also considered a `` tilted '' model with no spectral running and @xmath198 ( the effective tilt of the rm @xmath82 model on the cobe scale ) and found that this model predicts central densities that are more than @xmath199 larger than the those predicted by the rm @xmath82 model over the range @xmath200 kms@xmath201 kms@xmath51 .",
    "given that precise measurements of the tilt of the power spectrum and the running of the spectral index using the data from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite ( url http://www.sdss.org/ ) and the microwave anisotropy probe ( url http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html ) are on the horizon @xcite , it may be useful to adopt an empirical stance and consider the maximum tilt and running that are acceptable with respect to galactic central densities without linking the tilt and running through a particular inflationary model . as it is difficult to quantify the agreement or disagreement of a particular parameter choice with the data and because the current data certainly do not constrain the slope of the relationship between @xmath153 and @xmath3",
    ", we adopt the somewhat arbitrary , but sensible , criterion that a model predicts unacceptably diffuse galaxies if @xmath202 at @xmath203 kms@xmath51 . using the this criterion ,",
    "we find that a lower limit on @xmath52 allowed as a function of @xmath204 can be approximated as [ eq : mtilt ] n(k _ * ) + 6.76dn(k_*)/dk  0.77 .",
    "these maximally tilted models have @xmath205 for @xmath206 .",
    "if we adopt the criterion that a `` good '' fit to the data has @xmath207 at @xmath203 kms@xmath51 then a good fit to the data is given approximately by [ eq : gtilt ] n(k _ * ) + 6.97dn(k_*)/dk 0.87 .",
    "we also showed that massive neutrinos with @xmath208 ev @xmath209 ev may provide an alternative solution to the central density problem ; however , we consider this solution rather less attractive . in order for neutrinos to solve the central density problem ,",
    "it is necessary to nearly saturate our adopted lower limit on @xmath27 because , relative to the standard scale invariant model , the power spectrum is damped by a factor @xmath210 on scales smaller than @xmath211 ( corresponding , roughly speaking , to @xmath212 ) whereas in the inflationary models , power falls off continuously with increasing wave number .",
    "the range of neutrino masses allowed by the above criterion that the dark matter halos not be too diffuse is @xmath213 ev , but as we mentioned earlier a neutrino mass greater than @xmath214 ev leads to unacceptably small values of @xmath27 .",
    "a neutrino mass of @xmath215 ev implies that @xmath216 .",
    "we did not deal directly with the issue of central slopes .",
    "the problematic issue here is that cold ( and warm ) dark matter halo densities diverge at small radii whereas galactic rotation curves seem to be fit better with constant density cores @xcite .",
    "while this is a worrisome situation , as we discussed above it is difficult to tell the degree to which this is a serious challenge to lcdm .",
    "first , _ all _ observational errors favor constant density cores over cusps .",
    "second , while it has been observed that pseudoisothermal density profiles with constant density cores often fit galactic rotation curves better than nfw profiles @xcite , the conclusion that observations indicate halos have cores rather than cusps is a nonsequitur .",
    "this is because _ all _ points on the curve contribute to the fit .",
    "rotation curve fits are often largely determined by the transition region between the two power laws of the profile , and may not be faithful representations of the observed rotation curves at small radii ( where there are relatively few data points ) .",
    "in addition , van den bosch and swaters showed that most rotation curves can be acceptably fit by divergent density profiles as long as the galaxies are much less centrally concentrated than standard lcdm predicts @xcite . to address the inner slope issue , it is probably more useful to use a fitting form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkbp ] ) , despite the fact that it is not inspired by a theoretical model , because it `` decouples '' the two power laws of the model rotation curve .",
    "our solution to the central density problem likely can not solve the cuspy halo issue by itself because central cusps are more a reflection of the cold and collisionless properties of the dark matter than the amount of small - scale power ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nonetheless",
    ", as we have already mentioned , the cuspy halo issue is to some degree degenerate with the central density problem and it may be that solving the latter problem may go a long way toward resolving the former .",
    "a third problem associated with the standard lcdm paradigm is the dwarf satellite problem @xcite .",
    "in essence , this problem can be stated in the following way : standard lcdm overpredicts the number of satellite halos with @xmath217 kms@xmath218 kms@xmath51 by as much as an order of magnitude relative to the number of observed satellite galaxies in the local group . as we mentioned earlier , kamionkowski and liddle @xcite investigated solving this problem with bsi initial power spectra .",
    "it is probable that at least part of the solution lies in a feedback mechanism , like reionization suppression @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of feedback needed will depend crucially on the input power spectrum .",
    "we examine the subhalo issue in the context of inflation in a forthcoming companion paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , we find that the discord between theory and observation can be greatly allayed by considering models similar to those studied here and thus , the feedback needed to meet observations can be greatly reduced or even eliminated .",
    "related to the dwarf satellite problem is the recent result of dalal and kochanek @xcite .",
    "the perturbing effect of substructure in strong gravitational lenses allowed them to constrain the fraction of the host halo mass bound up in substructure to be @xmath219 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "they used this result to limit the tilt of the primordial spectrum and put constraints on the neutrino mass , and they obtained @xmath220 and @xmath221 ev at 95% confidence . our results on substructure differ from those of dalal and kochanek .",
    "as we discuss in our forthcoming paper @xcite , we find that for a host halo of the relevant mass , the total mass fraction in subhalos is typically larger than the lower limit of dalal and kochanek ( @xmath222 ) even with significantly tilted primordial spectra , @xmath223 .",
    "thus the tilt of the primordial power spectrum may not yet be significantly constrained by strong lensing results . however , as we have demonstrated here , the long `` lever arm '' from cobe scales to the subgalactic regime offers a potentially useful avenue for constraining models of inflation . perhaps future lensing studies will provide more significant limits , and thus test the intriguing possibility that galaxy rotation curves are telling us something fundamental about the early universe .",

    "<S> the lingering problem with high central densities in dark halos has arisen in the context of ( l)cdm cosmologies with @xmath0 scale - invariant initial power spectra . although @xmath0 is often justified by appealing to the inflation scenario , the choice is not generally justified . specifically , inflation models with mild but important deviations from scale invariance ( @xmath1 ) are not uncommon , and those with significant `` running '' of the spectral index are quite plausible . </S>",
    "<S> even a mild deviation from scale invariance can be important because halo collapse times and densities depend on the relative amount of small - scale power . here </S>",
    "<S> , we choose several popular , often well - motivated , models of inflation and work out the ramifications for galaxy central densities . for each model , we calculate its cobe - normalized primordial power spectrum and deduce the implied halo densities using a semi - analytic method calibrated against n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our predictions to a sample of @xmath2 dark matter - dominated galaxies using a non - parametric measure of the density , @xmath3 , defined as the mean mass density , relative to the critical density , within the radius at which the rotation curve falls to half of its maximum value . while standard @xmath0 lcdm halos are overdense by a factor of @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> several of our example inflation+cdm models predict halo densities well within , and even below , the range preferred by observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how the presence of massive ( @xmath5 ev ) neutrinos can help to alleviate the central density problem , even with a scale invariant spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that galaxy central densities may not be as problematic for the cdm paradigm as is sometimes assumed : rather than telling us something about the nature of dark matter , galaxy rotation curves may be telling us something about inflation and/or neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> . an important test of this idea will be an eventual consensus on the value of @xmath6 , the rms overdensity on the scale @xmath7mpc . </S>",
    "<S> our successful models tend to have values of @xmath8 , which is well within the range of recent determinations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , models with @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) are highly disfavored . </S>"
