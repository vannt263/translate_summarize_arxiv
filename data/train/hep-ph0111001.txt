    "a rather natural explanation for the replication of the fermionic generations is that the known leptons and quarks are composite @xcite and they should be regarded as the ground state of a rich spectrum of fermions . therefore , the observation of excited quarks and leptons would be an undeniable signal for compositeness @xcite .    up to now all direct searches for compositeness have failed . at the desy @xmath7 collider hera @xcite ,",

    "when we vary @xmath31 and @xmath59 we display in table [ br ] the branching ratios for excited electrons and neutrinos for the above choices of couplings .",
    "in this paper we analyze the potentiality of the lhc to directly search for excited electrons and neutrinos via the reactions ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "the signal and backgrounds were simulated at the parton level with full tree level matrix elements , taking into account interference effects between the sm and excited lepton contributions .",

    "the sm cross sections are @xmath69    a natural way to extract the excited electron signal , and at the same time suppress the sm backgrounds , is to impose a cut on the @xmath70 invariant mass .",

    "[ distributions_eea](a ) [ ( b ) ] contains the @xmath70 invariant distribution in the reaction @xmath71 [ @xmath72 for the sm and with the inclusion of an excited electron with mass @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 tev@xmath75 . from these figures",
    "we can see that it is convenient to collect the data in @xmath70 invariant mass bins since the signal is concentrated in a small region of this invariant mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , we introduced the cut @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the center of a 50 gev invariant mass bin .",
    "certainly this cut is ideal for excited electrons of mass @xmath78 .",
    "however , the cut ( [ inv_mass_eg ] ) is efficient only for excited electron masses up to 1250 gev since heavier excited electrons are rather broad resonances and we also run out of statistics .",
    "consequently , we only considered @xmath79 gev . to search for heavier excited electrons ( @xmath80 gev )",
    ", we performed a new analysis replacing the cut ( [ inv_mass_eg ] ) by @xmath81    to further reduce the sm background , we also vetoed events exhibiting @xmath6 s decaying into @xmath82 pairs through the cut @xmath83    excited neutrinos contribute only to the @xmath84 production and they can be identified by the @xmath85 transverse mass ( @xmath86 ) distribution ; see fig.[distributions_eva ] .",
    "analogously to the excited electron case , we looked for an excess of events in @xmath87 bins of 50 gev via the additional cut @xmath88 where @xmath77 is a variable parameter .",
    "this cut enhances the signal of excited neutrinos whose mass is @xmath77 .",
    "once again , the cut ( [ trans_mass_ng ] ) is efficient only for excited neutrino masses up to 1250 gev so we restricted @xmath79 gev . for higher masses ( @xmath89 gev ) ,",
    "the decay width of the excited neutrino is so large that we performed a different study replacing the cut ( [ trans_mass_ng ] ) by @xmath90    the above cuts ( [ inv_mass_eg])([trans_mass_ng_hm ] ) reduce the sm background drastically .",
    "for instance , assuming an excited lepton mass of 250 gev ( @xmath91 ) the sm background for the processes ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) is reduced to @xmath92 where we applied cuts ( [ acceptance]-[inv_mass_ee ] ) to the first two results and ( [ acceptance ] ) , ( [ trans_mass_ng ] ) and ( [ trans_mass_ng_hm ] ) to the last one",
    ". tables [ back1][back3 ] contain the cross sections of the irreducible background after cuts for several excited lepton masses where we can see that the background diminishes very fast with the increase of @xmath13 .    at this point , it is important to consider other possible sources of background to these final states since the irreducible background has been largely reduced .",
    "for example , additional backgrounds are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where a jet is misidentified as a photon . taking the jet faking photon probability at the lhc to be @xmath95 @xcite",
    ", we present also in tables [ back1][back3 ] the expected cross section for these processes . another possible reducible background for the process",

    ", we assumed that the observed number of events is the one predicted by the sm .",
    "let us start our analysis by the search for excited electrons . in this case",
    ", we assumed that @xmath99 in order to reduce the number of free parameters , and we imposed the cuts ( [ acceptance ] )  ( [ inv_mass_ee ] ) with @xmath100 to maximize the sensitivity for excited fermions of mass @xmath13 .",
    "we display in figure [ limits](a ) the 95% c.l .",
    "bounds on the coupling @xmath101 , coming from the process @xmath102 ( @xmath84 ) , as a function of the excited electron mass .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath103 production leads to slightly better limits on excited electrons except at small @xmath13 .",
    "the combined results of these two processes are also presented in this figure and these bounds turn out to be at least an order of magnitude more stringent than the present best limits coming from the hera experiments .",
    "moreover , the lhc will be able to extend considerably the range of excited electron masses that can be probed ( up to 2 tev ) .    in the study of the excited neutrino production",
    ", we assumed @xmath104 that leads to a non - vanishing @xmath105 coupling .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limits on @xmath101 that can be obtained from the reaction @xmath106 , where we imposed the cuts ( [ acceptance ] ) and ( [ trans_mass_ng ] )  ( [ trans_mass_ng_hm ] ) , are shown in figure [ limits](b ) .",
    "notice that the limits on excited neutrinos from this process are looser ( stronger ) than the ones derived for excited electrons for @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) gev .",
    "furthermore , these bounds are orders of magnitude more stringent than the presently available ones and they span a much larger range of excited neutrino masses .",
    "it is also interesting to obtain a bound on the excited electron mass assuming that @xmath99 and @xmath109 . in this scenario ,",
    "the lhc will be able to rule out excited electrons with masses smaller than 1 tev , at 95% c.l .",
    ", through the study of either the @xmath110 or @xmath84 productions , while their combined results increase this limit by 40 gev .",
    "this limit improves the present hera bound ( 233 gev ) @xcite by a factor of roughly 5 . in the case of excited neutrinos , assuming @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the analysis of the @xmath84 final state leads to @xmath113 gev at 95% c.l .. again , this limit is much more restrictive than the available hera one ( @xmath114 gev ) .",
    "note that for the choice @xmath99 ( @xmath104 ) , the coupling of excited neutrinos ( electrons ) to photons vanishes . in this way",
    ", the production of a pair of leptons @xmath115 or @xmath116 with a photon can probe only the excited electron ( neutrino ) production if @xmath99 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "therefore , we should also consider the excited lepton decay into a @xmath5 or a @xmath6 and an ordinary lepton in these cases . taking into account only the leptonic decay of the weak gauge bosons",
    ", we also analyzed the processes @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "notice that excited electrons can contribute to both reactions , while excited neutrinos only to the second one .    in order to look for excited electrons in the @xmath119 and @xmath118 productions",
    ", we applied initially the acceptance cut ( [ acceptance ] ) and then required @xmath120 for all possible @xmath82 pairs .",
    "this cut reduces the sm contribution due to photon exchange .",
    "the sm background to the @xmath119 production receives a large contribution from the @xmath6 pair production and it can be further suppressed by vetoing events that exhibit two @xmath82 pairs compatible with being a @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath121 where @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) is the electron / positron with the highest ( smallest ) energy .",
    "the sm background for the excited neutrino search in the @xmath124 channel can be depleted by requiring that the transverse mass calculated using all charged leptons satisfy @xmath125 another important sm contribution to this reaction is @xmath126 production with the @xmath6 decaying into a pair @xmath12 and the @xmath5 decaying into a pair @xmath116 . in order to reject this process",
    ", we vetoed events displaying a pair @xmath82 compatible with being a @xmath6 and the invariant mass of the remaining @xmath127 close to the @xmath5 mass , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath128 moreover , the excited electron signal in this topology originates from its charged current production in association with a neutrino .",
    "therefore , the three charged leptons in the final state come from the decays of the excited electron . to further enhance the signal we performed the analysis considering bins in the invariant mass of the three charged leptons in the final state @xmath129 , _",
    "i.e. _ we demanded that @xmath130 where the center of the bin @xmath77 is again a variable parameter .",
    "we present in figure [ limits_4](a ) the attainable 95% c.l .",
    "limits on excited electrons coming from the @xmath131 and @xmath132 reactions , assuming that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "as we can see , the bounds for @xmath133 are an order of magnitude weaker than the ones originating from the decay of the excited electron into a photon  electron pair .",
    "notwithstanding , these processes are important when this decay channel is closed .",
    "as expected , the four lepton bounds for @xmath135 are @xmath136% more restrictive than the ones for @xmath137 .",
    "the charged current production of excited neutrinos can contribute only to the @xmath118 final state .",
    "the decay of the excited neutrino either in @xmath138 or in @xmath139 leads to @xmath140 once we consider the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay into first family leptons .",
    "therefore , the transverse mass of the @xmath82 @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 is its transverse momentum , characterizes the excited neutrino production . in order to isolate the excited neutrino signal in the @xmath118 topology",
    ", we initially applied the cuts ( [ acceptance ] ) , ( [ cut_photon ] ) , and ( [ cut_mtphoton ] ) and then we required the event to present an @xmath144 pair with a transverse mass in the bin @xmath145 with @xmath77 being a variable parameter that enhances the search for excited neutrinos with mass @xmath78 .",

    "we analyzed the potential of the lhc to unravel the existence of excited leptons through the study of the processes ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "we assumed a center - of - mass energy of 14 tev and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath75 in our calculations .",
    "the final states containing a photon ( @xmath110 or @xmath84 ) lead to the most stringent bounds , as can be seen in figure ( [ limits ] ) , provided the excited lepton ( @xmath38 ) has a sizable branching ratio into pairs @xmath148 .",
    "otherwise , the search for excited leptons should be carried out studying the final states @xmath119 and @xmath118 where our results are presented in figure ( [ limits_4 ] ) .",
    "we also considered the possibility of the @xmath19 boson in the processes ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) decaying into muons , however the improvement in the bounds is marginal .    for light excited leptons ( @xmath149 gev ) ,",

    "assuming @xmath99 and @xmath150 , the lhc will be able to exclude the existence of excited leptons with masses up to 1 tev .",
    "a similar sensibility can be reached at the next linear collider ( nlc ) @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we assumed that the excited leptons interact with the sm particles via the effective operator ( [ lag_1 ] ) .",
    "this is a conservative assumption since it is possible that excited fermions may also couple to ordinary quarks and leptons via contact interactions originating from the strong constituent dynamics . in this case",
    ", the production cross section should be enhanced @xcite .",
