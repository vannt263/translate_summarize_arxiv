    "the x - ray transient xtej1550@xmath0564 was discovered simultaneously by the all - sky monitor on the rossi x - ray timing explorer @xcite and by the burst and transient source experiment on the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite on mjd  51063 ( 1998  sept  7 ; mjd@xmath2jd@xmath0240000.5 ) . following the discovery of the radio counterpart @xcite , xtej1550@xmath0564 was monitored with the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843  mhz between mjd  51065 and 51092 .",
    "a flare was recorded , peaking with an estimated flux density of 380  mjy on mjd  51078 .",
    "two very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations using the australian long baseline array ( lba ) were performed 23 days after the most flare . in this paper",
    "we present the resulting images from these observations , and discuss briefly the implications of the evolving structure observed .",
    "the vlbi observations were carried out on 1998 sept 24 and 25 and are summarized in table  [ tabobs ] .",
    "the data post - correlation used the aips task fring to find fringes and calibrate the fringe amplitude .",
    "due to the small number of baselines , the caltech program difmap was used to model and source fit the data , and measure the flux densities .",
    ".vlbi observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the image from 1998 sept 25 clearly shows an additional component compared to the image on 1998 sept 24 . as the image center is arbitrary , it is not obvious how to relate the components seen in the two images . however , two - point spectral indices derived from australia telescope compact array data at the time of the radio flare show a flattening just prior to the first vlbi observation from about @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) over the interval 4.88.6  ghz @xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the behavior seen in the 4.88.6  ghz two - point spectral index of groj1655@xmath040 during the 1994 jet ejection episodes @xcite and strongly suggests that a new optically thick outburst occurred .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then we associate the central component in the bottom panel with the flaring core and thus the two components in the top panel , the ejecta , can be associated with the two outermost components in the bottom panel .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the 1998 sept 25 single - baseline 8.4  ghz data which shows a new unresolved component not present in the 1998 sept 24 data .",
    "this means that in one day the ejecta have moved apart by approximately 115  mas . at an estimated distance of 3.55  kpc ( mcintyre , in preparation )",
    "this implies a separation velocity @xmath1 for the ejecta , which makes xtej1550@xmath0564 the fifth galactic source to exhibit apparent superluminal motion .",
    "we have presented two vlbi images of xtej1550@xmath0564 from the time of the 1998 september outburst and showed that the source evolved over a period of 24  hours .",
    "the two outermost components seen in the 1998 sept 25 image are associated with the two components in the 1998 sept 24 image , implying an apparent separation velocity of @xmath1 .    the australia telescope compact array and the mopra telescope are part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
