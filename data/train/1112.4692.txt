    "single - top production is also expected to play a crucial role in determining the @xmath3quark content in protons and anti - protons .",

    "( nlo ) corrections to the total cross section of @xmath5 and @xmath4channel single - top productions have been known for some time already  @xcite .",
    "they were followed by nlo corrections to the fully differential cross sections  @xcite .",
    "more recently single - top production has been included in monte carlo ( mc ) event generators which are based on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross sections .",
    "there are two main frameworks in this context : mc@nlo  @xcite and powheg  @xcite which are both extensively used by experimental collaborations . in both , all three production channels shown in fig.([fig : st_lo ] )",
    "are included , including the decay of the top quark and angular correlations  @xcite .",

    "the third production channel shown in fig.([fig : st_lo ] ) is the @xmath7associated production channel .",
    "as can be seen there are overall two topologies contributing to this production mode at lo , and in both cases there is one gluon in the initial state . at the tevatron",
    "the @xmath7cross section is negligible but at the lhc , due to the high gluon content of the colliding hadrons at those energies , @xmath7production is the second largest of the three channels in fig.([fig : st_lo ] ) with @xmath860 pb . + from a theoretical point of view @xmath7 associated production is rather subtle and hence deserves a bit more attention here . at nlo @xmath7associated productions interferes with lo @xmath0production in the limit where the @xmath9quark becomes on - shell and decays into @xmath10 .",
    "the interfering diagrams are shown in fig.([fig : wt_int ] ) . in order to define @xmath7production in its own right it is necessary to provide a method that makes the distinction from @xmath0possible .",
    "this is a well - known issue and has been described in various papers  @xcite .",
    "+ theoretically , a consistent procedure would be to consider all processes having the final states @xmath11 or @xmath12 and then halt the perturbative expansion at @xmath13 .",
    "this , however , would be at the expense of the theoretical accuracy of @xmath0production .",
    "therefore a different approach was chosen within both the mc@nlo and powheg frameworks and we briefly sketch the ideas here .",
    "+ as mentioned the aim is , ultimately , to be able to generate two physically well - defined samples for both @xmath7 and @xmath0production without facing the problem of interference . furthermore , both should be defined in the context of a parton shower mc .",
    "the approach chosen in both mc@nlo and powheg is to consider two fundamentally different definitions of @xmath7production and to compare them  @xcite . identifying the interference term as @xmath14 , the doubly resonant contribution as @xmath15 and the singly resonant contribution as @xmath16 , the first approach , called _ diagram removal _",
    "( dr ) , consists of removing the contributions corresponding to terms @xmath14 and @xmath15 . while this obviously removes the overlap with @xmath0production it formally breaks qcd gauge invariance .",
    "the issues connected to this are clarified in great detail in  @xcite .",
    "+ in order to assess the impact of the shortcomings of dr a second approach has been taken , called _ diagram subtraction _ ( ds ) . in this approach a counter - term",
    "is constructed such that the doubly resonant parts are subtracted effectively when @xmath0 becomes resonant .",
    "this approach is gauge invariant and the subtraction is performed at the level of the amplitude squared .",
    "considering the expressions for both dr and ds we can say something about the size of the interference term and hence something about the validity and possible shortcomings of both approaches . in",
    "@xcite the two approaches were compared and it was shown that there is a very good agreement .",

    "the top is produced on - shell and , then , subsequently decays .",

    "it was found that the corrections stemming from the non - factorizable corrections are , in general , small , thus rendering the nwa approach a valid approximation for most purposes .",
    "current versions of both mc@nlo and powheg rely on the five flavor scheme ( 5f ) . in this approach",

    "the lo calculation is carried out in the four flavor scheme ( 4f ) .",

    "we see that there are small yet visible differences between the two schemes .",
    "furthermore we also see the increased sensitivity to the scale choice in the 4f scheme , which stems from the additional , explicit dependence on @xmath29 .",

    "from a technical point of view the most obvious extension to the standard model is to consider the associated production of a top quark with a charged higgs boson , i.e. @xmath49production .",
    "charged higgs bosons occur naturally in a range of models , including _ two higgs - doublet models _",
    "( 2hdm ) and in the _ minimal super - symmetric model _ ( mssm ) . + as indicated , @xmath49productions is technically very similar to @xmath7production .",
    "however , since charged higgs bosons have not yet been observed , it is necessary to distinguish between two case :      in the latter case one faces the exact same technical challenges as in @xmath7production .",
    "here it is sufficient to point out that it has been implemented in mc@nlo using the same definitions ( dr and ds )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , approximate nnlo results for the @xmath49cross section have also been calculated  @xcite . +",
    "while being technically easier , the first case , i.e. for @xmath53 , presents other challenges , connected to signal extraction .",
    "the suggested procedure in previous studies requires the presence of a second @xmath3jet to be used as a handle in @xmath49event selection .",

    "however , it still remains to be determined whether the coupling also has a right - handed component . by conducting detailed studies of single - top production and decay",

    "a study carried out recently for @xmath1productions found that the azimuthal and energy distributions for the charged lepton ( from the decaying top ) and the azimuthal distribution of @xmath3quark are sensitive to @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the @xmath55coupling  @xcite . +",
    "another approach is to consider the angle between the charged lepton in the @xmath63 rest frame and the @xmath63momentum in the top rest frame , @xmath64 . using this observable the partial width of the top quark can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the normalized partial width for top decay to the three @xmath63 helicity states . by measuring the @xmath67",

    "+ by studying top production in association with jets it is possible to learn about the nature of the couplings of the top quark . in  @xcite direct top production",
    "was compared to two sm single - top production channels ( single - top @xmath5 and @xmath4channel ) .",
    "in particular angular correlations between the leptons , stemming from the top decay , and jets were investigated and it was shown that direct top production often shows different correlations from its sm brethren . + more recently production of top quarks together with missing energy , so - called _ monotops _ , was investigated  @xcite .",
    "production of monotops can not happen at tree - level within the sm and their discovery would therefore imply new physics .",
