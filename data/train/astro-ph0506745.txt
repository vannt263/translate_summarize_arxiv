    "we are engaged in a large scale project to find additional emp stars in the halo of our galaxy by mining the database of the he s .",
    "the normal procedures outlined by @xcite to isolate emp stars from the candidate lists produced by the he s were followed .",
    "the candidates were vetted via moderate resolution spectroscopy at large telescopes to eliminate the numerous higher abundance interlopers .",
    "most of the follow up spectra for the stars discussed here were obtained with the double spectrograph on the hale telescope at palomar mountain .",
    "we intend to observe all candidates to the magnitude limit of the he s ( b @xmath6 17.5 ) in our fields ; with @xmath61600 moderate resolution spectra in hand from campaigns at palomar and at the las campanas observatory , observations are now complete in @xmath6990 deg@xmath7 , complete to b=16.5 in an additional @xmath6700 deg@xmath7 , and approaching completion in the remaining fields .    these follow up spectra are used to determine an accurate measure of the metallicity of the star via a combination of strength of absorption in h@xmath8 ( determining @xmath9 ) and in the ca  ii line at 3933    ( the kp index ) , which then determines [ fe / h ] .",
    "the calibration between the strength of the indices and resulting metallicity [ fe / h](hes ) adopted by the he s is described in @xcite and is essentially identical to that used by the hk survey until recently ; the latest updates to the algorithm as used by the hk survey are described in @xcite .",
    "we have found that there are systematic scale errors in the [ fe / h ] values determined by this algorithm for certain emp highly c - enhanced giants . as is shown in @xcite ,",
    "these scale errors act to make certain c - stars appear more metal poor by a factor of @xmath610 than would be inferred from a detailed abundance analysis of their high dispersion spectra .",
    "these problems appear to arise due to molecular absorption of ch and cn in the specific continuum bandpasses used to measure the kp and the h@xmath8 line indices from which [ fe / h ] is inferred .",
    "this makes both of these lines appear weaker , and hence the inferred fe - abundance of such a c - star is underestimated .",
    "this effect is largest for the cooler c - stars ( @xmath9@xmath65100  k ) with high c - enhancement and high n / c ratios .",
    "normal - c giants and the warmer c - stars are not affected ; [ fe / h](hes ) and [ fe / h](hires ] are in good agreement for them .",
    "we rely on the results of an extensive set of detailed abundance analyses of stars expected to have [ fe / h ] @xmath10 dex selected from the hamburg / eso survey to establish these claims .",
    "we have obtained and analyzed spectra with hires @xcite at the keck i telescope of @xmath660 he s candidate emp stars .",
    "@xcite will present abundance analyses for 14 of the 16 known carbon stars from this he s sample .",
    "fifteen c - normal giants have been analyzed to date as well , while @xcite studied a large sample of candidate emp dwarfs from the he s .",
    "the first consequence of these scale errors is that the fraction of carbon stars at extremely low metallicities has been substantially overestimated in several papers in the recent literature .",
    "our operational definition of a c - star is one whose spectrum shows bands of c@xmath11 . if no c@xmath11  bands are detected , but [ c / fe ] @xmath12 dex , we denote a star to be c - enhanced .",
    "the strength of the c@xmath11  bands will be a function of @xmath9 , @xmath13(c ) , and to a lesser extent , log(@xmath14 )  and [ fe / h ] .",
    "also we denote stars with @xmath9  @xmath15  k as `` dwarfs '' , while all cooler stars are called `` giants '' .",
    "even though the cooler c - stars comprise only a small fraction of the most metal poor stars , an underestimate of a factor of @xmath61 dex in their [ fe / h](hes ) will have significant effects .",
    "[ fig_feh_vmk ] shows [ fe / h](hes ) versus v - k for a sample of 489 emp candidates from the he s with moderate resolution spectra from the double spectrograph at the hale telescope .",
    "the known c - stars and the c - enhanced star with hires analyses from this sample are indicated . in the upper panel , the c -",
    "rich stars are plotted at their [ fe / h](hes ) values , while in the lower panel they are plotted at their [ fe / h](hires ) as determined from detailed abundance analyses .",
    "although at their nominal fe - metallicities the c - stars dominate the population of the giants below [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath16 dex , using the results from analysis of high resolution spectra in the lower panel the frequency of c - stars among the most metal poor emp stars is reduced by a factor of 2.5 . the c - star frequency for the palomar sample of he s giants with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath17 dex is 7.4@xmath2% .",
    "adding in the fraction of c - enhanced stars among giants with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath17 dex we establish below of 6.5@xmath18% , one obtains a total fraction of c - rich stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath19 dex of 14@xmath4% among our he s emp sample with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath17 dex .",
    "the metallicity distribution function is very sharply declining among halo stars at the lowest fe - metallicities .",
    "thus the systematic errors we have found in the calibration of the he s and by inference the hk metallicity scale of @xcite , at least until quite recently ( see rossi _ et al . _  2005 ) will also lead directly to systematic overestimates of the number of emp stars and of the yield for emp stars by these two major surveys .",

    "[ fig_cfe ] shows the resulting histogram of [ c / fe ] for the giants from this sample with [ fe / h ] @xmath24 dex .",
    "the histogram suggests a peak near [ c / fe ] @xmath6 0.3 dex , somewhat higher than the normal value for unmixed very metal poor giants of [ c / fe ] = 0.0 dex given by @xcite .",
    "there is a sharp drop towards higher c / fe ratios , with the c - stars occupying the upper limit of the range near [ c / fe ] @xmath6 + 2.0 dex . the distribution slowly decreases for c / fe ratios lower than the peak .",

    "to establish the results presented above , we have carried out a detailed abundance analysis using high dispersion spectra from hires at keck for a sample of 14 of the 16 carbon stars found in our database among candidate empstars selected from the he s . using a @xmath9  scale based on v - i , v - j and v - k colors , we find that the fe - metallicities for the cooler c - stars ( @xmath9  @xmath65100  k ) have been underestimated by a factor of @xmath610 by the standard he s survey tools . since we have not used the high resolution spectra themselves to determine @xmath9  or log(@xmath14 ) , the ionization equilibrium is a stringent test of our analysis and procedures , including the assumption of lte .",
    "we obtain a mean for log@xmath13(fe : fe  ii ) @xmath22 log@xmath13(fe : fe  i ) of @xmath26 dex , with a 1@xmath27 rms scatter about the mean of 0.18 dex .",
    "c - enhancement in these very metal poor c - stars appears to reach a maximum just below the solar @xmath13(c ) , and shows evidence of decreasing with decreasing @xmath9  ( increasing luminosity ) , presumably due to mixing and dredge - up of c - depleted material .",
    "[ fig_ba_feh ] shows [ ba / c ] as a function of fe - metallicity for this sample of c and c - enhanced stars .",
    "ten of the c - stars from the he s that we have analyzed show an enhancement of ba ( and of the other @xmath28-process neutron capture heavy elements ) approximately equal to that of c. the other four show [ ba / c ] @xmath29 dex , i.e. a strong c enhancement , with more normal heavy elements , as contrasted to enhancement of both c and the @xmath28-process elements in the majority of the c - stars . including 10 additional c - stars compiled from the literature , @xmath680% of the full sample of emp / vmp c - stars show highly enhanced ba , while @xmath620% has [ ba / c ] @xmath30 dex .",
    "it is clear from both the very high enhancements of lead and the ba / eu ratios seen among these c - stars that the @xmath28-process is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy neutron - capture elements , when present .    at first sight",
    ", this behavior suggests that two distinct processes are required to produce the ba - enhanced c - stars and those that are not .",
    "nucleosynthesis within an intermediate mass agb star can reproduce the first set of characteristics , but these c - stars are in general of too low a mass and are not sufficiently luminous or evolved to be agb stars .",
    "we suggest instead that the observed star is the former secondary in a binary system across which mass transfer has occured .    what about the @xmath620% of the c - stars without heavy element enhancements ?",
    "we suggest that there is no need to resort to intrinsic production or any other additional mechanism , and that essentially _ all _ of these stars are the original secondary stars in mass transfer binary systems .",
    "we ascribe the differing enhancement of the @xmath28-process elements from c - star to c - star within our sample to some dependence in the nucleosynthetic yields involving , for example , the initial [ fe / h ] and mass of the original primary star . at the lowest metallicities ,",
    "@xcite predict that little or no @xmath28-process enhancement will occur at the ba peak as there will be so few fe - seed nuclei that they will essentially all end up as lead .",
    "[ fig_ba_feh ] provides some support for this prediction .    in our hypothesis ,",
    "essentially all of these c - stars were once binaries .",
    "assuming most have survived to date without being disrupted , they should still be binaries with ( invisible ) white dwarf companions .",
    "the statistics of binary detection among very metal poor c - stars from the he s can not be evaluated from our sample as most of the stars have only been observed at a single epoch .",
    "so we look instead at the sample of c - stars added from the literature , which are mostly from the hk survey and are in general brighter than the he s c - stars in our sample .",
    "they have been known as interesting objects for timescales of several years to a decade , giving more opportunity for radial velocity monitoring .",
    "four of these 11 c - stars are confirmed binaries with measured periods , consistent with the preliminary results of the @xmath31 monitoring program of @xcite for @xmath28-process enhanced c - stars .",
    "although the sample is small , considering the lack of suitable long - term radial velocity monitoring programs , the length of the typical period , the small velocity amplitudes , the faintness of the stars , and the relatively short time they have been known to be interesting , we find our detection rate for binaries among very metal poor and emp c - strs to be consistent with all such stars being binaries ; simulations by @xcite support this .",
