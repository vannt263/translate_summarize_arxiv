    "the psf of each image was found not to vary significantly with position .",
    "stars on v_17 and i_04 , brighter than a certain limit , were then fitted with the appropriate psf and subtracted from the field .",
    "the procedure was repeated on the residual images in an iterative process cutting at fainter and fainter limits .    the resulting list of stars - separately in @xmath0 and @xmath1 - and their positions were used as a master list for all other images .",

    "the maximum corrections of the faintest cepheid magnitudes amounts to @xmath47 in @xmath0 and @xmath48 in @xmath1 .",
    "photometry at these levels of faintness and crowding are extremely vulnerable to how the background sky is measured .",
    "the three programs have some differences in their respective prescriptions for estimating background . romafot and dophot fit the background as part of the psf fitting .",
    "hstphot estimates background from the statistics of pixels surrounding the object .",
    "there are pros and cons to both approaches , and a philosophical discussion is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the differences in background that result from such procedural differences are small , but even systematic differences of a few analog to digital units ( adus ) ( of the order of sampling errors ) can produce noticeable differences in the measured magnitudes of faint stars . if program a measures sky systematically lower than program b , the stars measured by a will be brighter than by b. these effects are negligible for brighter stars , but as one approaches the detection limit , the differences increase .",
    "there is another , perhaps more significant way in which background measurements can be different .",
    "all three of the programs have a procedure where objects already identified are subtracted before a background estimate is made .",
    "however , the procedure by which objects are identified are different , and thus the exact list of objects that are subtracted from a given patch of sky will be different .",
    "again , this results in systematic differences in measured background , and manifests as differences in scale for measured magnitudes near the faint end . due to the nature of luminosity functions , both of stars , and of background galaxies",
    ", the problem gets more acute as one goes fainter .    in the face of this , there is no clear cut ` correct ' prescription . instead , the differences in resulting magnitudes for the objects of interest that are produced by different competent photometry procedures are a measure of the robustness of the magnitude measurements .",
    "the random error of a single magnitude can be determined from a comparison of the values obtained by the three different reduction procedures after zero point and scale difference are removed .",
    "deviation of the triple measurements of 250 stars with @xmath49 @xmath6 23.0 and @xmath50 @xmath6 22.0 is @xmath29 at this level and increases , of course , towards fainter magnitudes .",

    "[ fig8 ] - [ fig10 ] , respectively .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath0 = 19.2 and @xmath1 = 18.3 are saturated and have therefore not been included in the object list .",
    "the number of well fitted stars with @xmath0 _ and _ @xmath1 is @xmath51 in the case of romafot , @xmath52 for dophot , and @xmath53 for hstphot . these numbers are not directly comparable because in each case different lower fitting limits have been set , which were guided by a subjective estimate of what is practical and desirable .",
    "in addition , the total number of stars in each list can be altered by choosing different parameters like goodness - of - fit , signal - to - noise ratio , and in the case of hstphot also object - sharpness .    at brighter magnitudes , for instance @xmath54 ,",
    "the number of stars for which @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes were obtained with the three different reduction procedures is more comparable .",
    "3666 stars from romafot stand against 3469 stars from hstphot and 6012 stars from dophot .",
    "the reason for the different number of stars is the different star - searching routines employed .",
    "the number of selected stars increases with the decreasing size of the area to define the `` sky '' .",
    "dophot and hstphot employed a particularly small number of pixels for the `` sky '' definition in the star - searching routines . in contrast , romafot uses a relatively large `` sky '' in the star - searching routine .    the cmds of romafot show a number of blue stars at faint levels which are missing in the other cmds .",
    "this indicates that the romafot magnitudes have larger scatter below @xmath55 .",
    "the comparison with dophot and hstphot show that the romafot procedure used here is adequate for the discovery of the brightest and hence most reliable cepheids in m83 .",
    "the identification of the variable stars is based on the method by @xcite and is described in @xcite .",

    "they are expected to be still rather close neighbors .",
    "this issue is made even more acute , given the @xmath103 difference between the distance of ngc 5253 by @xcite and the original distance by the hst supernovae consortium ( hstsnc ) @xcite , even as they are both based on cepheids .",
    "the hstsnc reduced their hst observations with two reduction packages : romafot as implemented in midas was used at basel by l. labhardt and h. schwengeler , and the modified dophot reduction procedure as applied in baltimore was used by a. saha .",

    "the apparent modulus @xmath72 from the dophot photometry of _ seven additional _ cepheids is in agreement with that from the 5 ` excellent ' ones .",
    "however , in our judgment , the @xmath1 magnitudes for these 7 are not as reliable : they fall below our adopted dophot signal - to - noise threshold for reliable detection .",
    "one must also appreciate that the aberrated hst telescope produced images at the time with diffraction structure that could easily result in _ false detections _ , for which reason the detection thresholds had to be kept high .",
    "to that was added the problem of the very crowded nature of these fields .",
    "there was therefore good reason to keep the selection criterion for acceptable cepheids very conservative .    while a good many other putative variables were in fact detected both in baltimore and at basel , they were not considered further for fear of polluting with specious objects and erroneous photometry .",
    "if the errors in the apparent moduli in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the 5 excellent cepheids are propagated , the formal uncertainty is @xmath105 . with this in mind , the path taken by the hstsnc was to examine the _ differential _ extinction between cepheids and the type ia supernovae 1972e in ngc5253 , which is shown to provide tighter constraints on the snia calibration .",

    "we believe that the conservative selection of the 5 cepheids in @xcite yields a more reliable sample compared to the 7 cepheids used by @xcite , particularly since 3 of the latter 7 were explicitly rejected by @xcite , and the remaining 2 were not found by them . in this context",
    "it is worth remarking that in obtaining distances to the galaxies observed by the mfk et al .",

    "if the local infall vector is assumed to be 220 @xmath131 , @xmath142 becomes @xmath143 taking the m83 group at 4.5 mpc and the virgo cluster at 21.5 mpc .",
    "an observer at the centroid of the local group would therefore observe a recession velocity of the m83 group of @xmath144 if there was no disturbance from the virgo complex .",
    "the distances of the cen  a and m  83 groups as seen from the centroid of the local group - assumed to lie between the galaxy and m  31 at 2/3 of the m  31 distance @xcite - is 0.5 mpc larger than seen from the sun , hence @xmath145 ( lg @xmath146 cen  a ) @xmath147 mpc and @xmath145 ( lg @xmath146 m  83 ) @xmath148 mpc . in case of pure hubble flow and a cosmic value of @xmath149 = 60 @xcite",
    "the predicted group velocities would be @xmath126(cen  a ) @xmath150 and @xmath126(m  83 ) @xmath151 .",
    "these values differ from the observed ones by only @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "thus the deviations from pure hubble flow remain within the measurement errors .",
    "twelve cepheids with periods 12@xmath154 were found in ngc5236 ( m83 ) with the 8.2 m antu ( ut1 ) telescope of the vlt .",
    "this shows that the telescope in its present configuration can be used for work on cepheids out to @xmath6 5 mpc .",
    "the advantage over the much used wfpc2 of hst is the wider field and the better sampling of stellar images .",
    "disadvantages are the enhanced problem of crowding and the larger number of epochs required for period determinations , because an optimized epoch distribution is hampered by external observing conditions . in spite of this , the total exposure time needed for m83 ( 60000 sec ) is somewhat shorter than for a typical cepheid distance with the wfpc2 ( 85000 sec ) .",
    "the photometry was carried out with romafot .",
    "one epoch in @xmath0 and @xmath1 were independently reduced with dophot and hstphot .",
    "the photometric zero points agree to @xmath36 at @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the three magnitude systems show , however , a small difference in the photometric scales leading to mean magnitude differences of @xmath157 at @xmath1 = 22.5 ; the scale error at @xmath0 = 23.5 is only about half this value .",
    "these differences are explained by the different philosophies how to treat the galaxy background .",
    "this problem is inherent to all photometries of faint stars which are seen against a bright background .",
    "the distance of m83 was derived from the ten cepheids which have good light curves in @xmath0 and @xmath1 using three different p - l relations , i.e. the steep galactic p - l relation , calibrated through cepheids in open clusters _ and _ with baade - becker - wesselink distances , and two versions of the lmc p - l relation based both on an assumed modulus of @xmath158 .",
    "the resulting mean distance of m83 is found to be @xmath159 .",
    "the hardly significant difference in radial distance between m83 and ngc5253 and the small _ projected _ distance ( 0.15 mpc ) make it possible that the two galaxies have interacted in the past , which may be the origin of the unusual amorphous type of ngc5253 .",
    "the importance of the distances of m83 and ngc5253 , strengthening the mean distance of the m83 group of @xmath7 based also on trgb distances of the dwarf members of @xcite , is the continuing proof of the quietness of the local hubble flow just outside the local group .",
    "although the group is not the closest of the very local galaxies to the zero velocity surface that separates the beginning of the expansion field from the bound galaxies of the local group @xcite , it nevertheless is close enough to be important for the eventual mapping of the position of this surface at the local group boundary .    at the time of @xcite",
    "the i m dwarf galaxies leo a and pegasus dw ( ddo 216 ) were considered to be well beyond the local group .",
    "their low velocities reduced to the local group centroid are @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively .",
    "these are very low for their large distances of 1.6 mpc and 2.5 mpc , assumed on the basis of the extant literature of 1986 .",
    "it was this circumstance that gave considerable weight to the apparent detection of a deceleration due to the local group .",
    "@xcite for pegasus and @xcite and @xcite for leo a have shown that they are actually members of the local group .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived both a distance modulus of about ( m - m)@xmath163 , whereas @xcite derived ( m - m)@xmath164 . _ hence , the evidence of deceleration based on leo a and pegasus has disappeared_.    the question of deceleration will be discussed in a forthcoming paper using galaxies near the edge of the local group such as sextans  a and b , the antlia dwarf ( lgs3 ) , gr  8 , ngc  300 , as well as the m  81/ngc  2403 and the ic  342 groups .",
    "the emerging picture is that the expansion is already well in progress at a distance of @xmath6 1.5 mpc _",
    "( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the m83 group at 4.5 mpc and with a corrected velocity of @xmath165 fits well into this picture .",
    "the _ absence _ now of detectable deceleration of the velocity field outside the local group in the presence of a local group mass of @xmath166 @xcite or even @xmath167 , as suggested by its dynamical history @xcite , demands an explanation , as does the obviously _ small dispersion _ of the random velocities of the very local galaxies .",
    "coldness _ of the velocity field in the presence of the clearly lumpy distribution of the visible matter has been a puzzle since 1972 @xcite .    a modern suggestion that the total force field is nearly homogeneous ( smooth ) due to the dominance everywhere of",
    "an all pervasive cosmological constant , diluting any lumpy gravity field of the clustered matter , has been put forward now by many , perhaps the first being @xcite .",
    "these considerations make a continual precision mapping of the local velocity field on a scale of 10 mpc even more crucial .",
    "the work on m83 here is a contribution to this central problem .",
