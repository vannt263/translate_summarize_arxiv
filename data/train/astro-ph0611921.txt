    "gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) used the very large millennium simulation of springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to demonstrate that the standard @xmath0cdm paradigm predicts the clustering of dark matter haloes to depend not only on their mass but also on their formation time .",
    "the effect is strong for low - mass haloes but weak or absent at high mass .",
    "this result is surprising since it is incompatible with the standard excursion set theory for the growth of structure ( e.g. bond et al .",
    "1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 , mo & white 1996 ) , and it contradicts a fundamental assumption of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models often used to study galaxy clustering , namely that the galaxy content of a halo of given mass is statistically independent of its larger scale environment ( e.g. kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; jing , mo & boerner 1998 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2000 ; berlind et al . 2003 ; yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ) .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed this result ( harker et al .",
    "2006 ; zhu et al . 2006 ; wechsler et al . 2006",
    "; wetzel et al . 2007 ; jing , suto & mo 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , wechsler et al . ( 2006 ) demonstrated a dependence of halo clustering on halo concentration , noting it to have similar strength at high and low mass , but opposite sign ; concentrated haloes are the most clustered at low mass , but the least clustered at high mass .",
    "this is also surprising since there is a tight correlation between halo formation time and halo concentration ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; wechsler et al . 2001 ; zhao et al .",
    "2003 ) so one might expect a similar dependence on the two properties .",
    "more recently , bett et al . ( 2007 ) studied clustering as a function of halo spin and shape , finding stronger clustering at given mass for larger spin and for smaller major - to - minor axis ratio .",
    "( see also hahn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for a slightly different approach to studying environmental effects on halo spin . )",
    "interestingly , the dependences on shape and spin are stronger for high - mass haloes .",
    "we use the term `` assembly bias '' to describe all such dependences , since they show that the spatial distribution of haloes depends not only on their mass but also on the details of their assembly history .",
    "such details are undoubtedly reflected in the galaxy populations they host , so one may expect assembly bias to affect galaxy clustering in a way which is not easily represented in a simple hod model .",
    "a first assessment of the strength of such effects was made by croton , gao & white ( 2006 ) using a direct simulation of galaxy formation within the millennium simulation , while possible observational evidence for them has been cited by yang , mo & van den bosch ( 2006 ) , blanton , berlind & hogg ( 2007 ) and berlind et al .",
    "some recent theoretical work has explored extensions of excursion set theory which may allow a description of halo assembly bias ( wang , mo & jing 2007 , sandvik et al .",
    "2007 , zentner 2007 ) but it remains unclear whether these approaches can account for the results discussed above and in this paper .    in this letter",
    "we extend the work of gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) , again using the millennium simulation , by defining a less noisy estimator of clustering strength , by combining results for a number of redshifts , and by considering clustering as a function of halo properties other than formation time . as a result",
    ", we can study assembly bias in more detail and over a substantially wider halo mass range than in the earlier paper . in section  2",
    "we summarise the relevant properties of the simulation and of the halo database that we study . in section  3",
    ", we explore halo assembly bias as a function of halo mass and of a variety of halo structural properties .",
    "finally we give a short summary and discussion .",
    "the millennium simulation was carried out by the virgo consortium in 2004 on an ibm regatta system at the max planck society s supercomputer centre in garching ( springel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it adopted concordance values for the parameters of a flat @xmath0cdm cosmological model , @xmath3 , @xmath4 for the current densities in cold dark matter and baryons , @xmath5 for the present dimensionless value of the hubble constant , @xmath6 for the _ rms _ linear mass fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath7mpc extrapolated to @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for the slope of the primordial fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the simulation followed @xmath10 dark matter particles from @xmath11 to the present - day within a cubic region @xmath12mpc on a side .",
    "the individual particle mass is thus @xmath13 .",
    "the gravitational force had a plummer - equivalent comoving softening of @xmath14kpc .",
    "initial conditions were set using the boltzmann code cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) to generate a realisation of the desired power spectrum which was then imposed on a glass - like uniform particle load ( white 1996 ) .",
    "the tree - pm n - body code gadget2 ( springel 2005 ) was used to carry out the simulation and the full data were stored at @xmath15 times spaced approximately equally in the logarithm of the expansion factor at early times and at approximately 200 myr intervals after @xmath16 . at run time all collapsed haloes with at least 20 particles were identified using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) group - finder with linking parameter @xmath17 ( davis et al .",
    "post - processing with the substructure algorithm subfind ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) allowed a variety of internal structural properties to be measured for all these haloes and for their resolved subhaloes .",
    "this in turn allowed trees to be built which store detailed assembly histories for every object and its substructure . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on haloes with  small fof mass corresponding to 65 particles or more . at redshifts 3 , 2 , 1 and 0",
    "there are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 such fof haloes , respectively .",
    "the halo / subhalo data and their associated structure formation trees are publically available ( together with galaxy data from two independent galaxy formation models ) through a database at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium",
    "+    in the one - dimensional excursion set model for structure formation ( e.g. bond et al . 1991",
    "; lacey & cole 1993 ) , the formation history of a halo is encoded in the random walk at higher mass resolution than that which defines the halo itself , and is thus statistically independent of the environment , which is encoded in the random walk at lower resolution ( white 1996 ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the dependences on formation time and concentration found in simulations ( gao et al .",
    "2005 ; wechsler et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    "we extend the work of gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by defining a less noisy measure of clustering strength , by analysing data at @xmath16 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as well as @xmath8 , and by examining assembly bias as a function of properties other than formation time .    the specific halo properties which we will consider in this letter are :    * formation time *  following gao et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) , we define the formation time of a dark halo as the redshift when half of its final mass was first assembled into a single object .",
    "we use the stored merging tree to find the earliest time when its most massive progenitor had more than half the final mass , then interpolate linearly between this and the immediately preceding output to estimate the redshift when this progenitor had exactly half the final mass .",
    "this we define as the formation time .",
    "* concentration *  we characterise the concentration of a dark halo by the ratio @xmath24 of the peak value of its circular velocity curve to the circular velocity at @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath25 is the radius enclosing a mean overdensity 200 times the critical value .",
    "@xmath28 is the maximum value of @xmath29 for @xmath30 , evaluated using only particles bound to the main subhalo of the fof halo .",
    "this definition has the advantages of being robust and of not requiring any model to be fit to the simulation data .",
    "* subhalo mass fraction within @xmath25 *  as one measure of the amount substructure , we consider the fraction @xmath31 of the total mass within @xmath25 in the form of self - bound substructures detected by subfind .",
    "note that we exclude the main subhalo , which we identify with the body of the halo itself , and that subfind only catalogues subhaloes made up of 20 or more particles . in practice , we find that this measure can only be used effectively to rank haloes with fof masses above 5000 particles",
    ". we will not consider lower mass haloes when studying clustering as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "\\(4 ) * mass fraction in the main subhalo *  as an alternative measure of the amount of substructure in a halo , we use the ratio @xmath32 of the mass of the main self - bound subhalo to the mass of the original fof halo .",
    "this definition contrasts with the previous one in being sensitive to neighboring structures beyond @xmath25 which are `` fortuitously '' joined to the main halo by the fof linking procedure . with this measure",
    "we can study clustering as a function of substructure fraction to a fof mass limit of 2000 particles .",
    "* halo spin *  halo spin can be conveniently defined through @xmath33 where angular momentum @xmath34 and mass @xmath35 are the values within a sphere of radius @xmath25 and the circular velocity @xmath36 is also evaluated at this radius ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) .    as in gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we examine assembly bias by comparing the spatial clustering of a subset of haloes of given mass to that of the set as a whole . in the earlier paper we estimated a bias factor @xmath37 for each subset of haloes as the square root of the separation - averaged ratio of its spatial autocorrelation function to that of the dark matter .",
    "this estimator becomes quite noisy when the number of haloes in the subset is small . in this paper",
    "we prefer to estimate @xmath37 as the ratio of the halo - mass cross - correlation to the mass autocorrelation .",
    "specifically , we estimate @xmath37 as the relative normalisation factor which minimizes the mean square of the difference @xmath38 for four equal width bins in @xmath39 spanning the comoving separation range @xmath40 .",
    "this estimator has improved noise characteristics because of the large number of dark matter particles available . according to standard halo bias models",
    "it should be equivalent to the earlier estimator ( e.g. mo & white 1996 ) and we have verified that the two give consistent @xmath37 values for our halo data . in these models",
    "the large - scale bias depends on mass and redshift through the equivalent `` peak height '' @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rms _ linear _ overdensity ( extrapolated to @xmath8 ) within a sphere which in the mean contains mass @xmath35 , and @xmath43 is the linear overdensity threshold for collapse at redshift @xmath44 , again extrapolated to the corresponding value at @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath42 depends only on the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations , while @xmath43 depends on the current densities in gravitating matter and dark energy ( e.g. eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that halo clustering in the millennium simulation obeys this scaling over the redshift range @xmath45 .",
    "we will use it to superpose results from different redshifts .",
    "halo assembly bias is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] as a function of @xmath1 and of the various halo properties discussed above .",
    "these plots combine results for redshifts 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 . in each of the first five panels we repeat bias values for all haloes of a given mass from figure 1 of gao et al .",
    "the haloes in each @xmath2 bin are ranked in terms of each of the five properties in turn , and bias values are then estimated using our cross - correlation method for subsets consisting of haloes in the upper and lower 20% tails of the distribution in this additional property .",
    "dashed lines show bias values for the haloes with the highest formation redshifts , the highest concentrations , the most substructure and the most spin .",
    "solid lines give bias values for the opposite tails .",
    "colours ( both for symbols and for lines ) denote the redshift of the output from which the data were taken , as indicated by the labels .",
    "note the good agreement between results for different redshifts where these overlap .",
    "finally , the last panel of fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] gives halo mass as a function of @xmath2 for the four redshifts used to make this figure . with these curves one can convert the @xmath46-axes in the other panels to halo mass for @xmath47 .",
    "the results for formation time in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] confirm those of gao et al ( 2005 ) and extend them to considerably higher @xmath2 .",
    "assembly bias is strong only for low - mass haloes , with the oldest haloes being the most clustered .",
    "it is weak or absent at the highest masses .",
    "the largest @xmath2 values correspond to masses above @xmath48 at @xmath8 .",
    "there is a hint that the dependence may reverse at these masses , with young haloes being more clustered than old ones as argued by jing , suto & mo ( 2007 ) , but any such reversal is clearly very weak .",
    "their suggestion that reversal occurs near @xmath49 is clearly not supported by our data .",
    "the dependence of assembly bias on concentration differs qualitatively from that on formation time .",
    "the most concentrated haloes are the most clustered for @xmath50 , but they are the least clustered for @xmath51 .",
    "we have checked that at each @xmath2 our halo samples obey the relation between concentration and formation time first pointed out by navarro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; concentrated haloes of a given mass typically formed earlier than less concentrated haloes .",
    "nevertheless , there is clearly a range of @xmath2 ( roughly @xmath52 ) where clustering is significantly stronger for older yet also for _ less _ concentrated haloes .",
    "overall , our results for concentration agree well with those of wechsler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and jing , suto & mo ( 2007 ) , though they are less noisy because of the better statistics provided by the millennium simulation .",
    "the dependence of assembly bias on substructure is different again in shape , and moreover differs between our two substructure measures . for both",
    ", the dependence varies only slowly with @xmath2 , and haloes with more substructure are almost always the more strongly clustered .",
    "the dependence is stronger , however , when substructure is measured by the fraction of fof mass in the main subhalo ( @xmath32 ) than when it is measured by the subhalo mass fraction within @xmath25 ( @xmath31 ) , and it gets weaker with increasing @xmath2 in the first case , while it strengthens in the second .",
    "indeed , the dependence appears to reverse at @xmath50 in the @xmath31 case , although this needs to be confirmed by a simulation of higher resolution . note that at all @xmath2 our halo samples obey the kind of correlation of substructure with formation time and concentration pointed out out by gao et al .",
    "haloes with more substructure tend to be younger and to have lower concentrations .",
    "thus the dependence of assembly bias on substructure is the opposite of what might naively have been inferred from its dependence on formation time , and also differs qualitatively from that on concentration .",
    "assembly bias also depends on halo spin ; rapidly rotating haloes cluster more strongly than slowly rotating ones , with little dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the results of bett et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who find a somewhat stronger trend with halo mass .",
    "this may reflect their slightly different ( and cleaner ) definition of halo spin , their different ( and noisier ) estimator of bias , or the fact that they only used numerical data for @xmath8 .",
    "these plots show clearly that assembly bias depends on the physical properties of haloes in a complex way .",
    "typical effects are at the 10 to 30% level in @xmath37 ( 20 to 70% in correlation or power spectrum amplitude ) and depend on several additional parameters at fixed halo mass .",
    "our results are , however , consistent with the hypothesis that dependences on mass and redshift can be combined into a dependence on the single parameter @xmath2 .",
    "finally we note that because of the large size of the millennium simulation the formal errors on the bias curves of figure 1 are very small .",
    "we can see this in several ways .",
    "there is little fluctuation along each dashed or solid curve , even though neighboring points refer to disjoint @xmath2 ranges with no halos in common , and so should have uncorrelated sampling uncertainties .",
    "then we have estimated uncertainties for each dashed and solid curve by measuring the _ rms _ scatter in @xmath37 among 100 bootstrap resamplings of the halo subsamples corresponding to the central and the largest values of @xmath2 plotted . in every case",
    "the scatter at corresponding points on the solid and dashed curves is consistent within the estimation uncertainties .",
    "we thus average these values in quadrature , listing the results in parentheses in each panel to represent `` typical '' and `` maximal '' uncertainties .",
    "typical uncertainties in @xmath37 are all between 2 and 3% , while maximal uncertainties are around 5% . at the small @xmath2 end of each curve bootstrap errors are always below 1% .",
    "finally , and for us most convincingly , the overlap between the curves for different redshifts is excellent in almost all cases .",
    "panel ( f ) shows that the relevant mass limits differ by one or two orders of magnitude , so that the samples involved are almost disjoint .",
    "in addition , properties such as formation time or concentration are independently evaluated at the different redshifts so that there is almost no correlation between the particular objects that fall into the 20% tails .",
    "in this letter , we have used the very large millennium simulation to study assembly bias , the fact that the large - scale clustering of haloes of given mass depends on the details of how they were assembled .",
    "we have extended earlier work by using numerical data from four different redshifts , by using a less noisy estimator of clustering strength , and by studying bias effects as a function of five physical properties of haloes in addition to their mass .",
    "assembly bias manifests itself in significantly and qualitatively different ways for each of the five halo properties we have considered , although for all of them our results are consistent with a dependence on mass and redshift through the single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the differences between our spin results and those of bett et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest a dependence on the detailed definition of spin which may parallel that on the detailed definition of substructure fraction which we found above .",
    "assembly bias varies with halo properties at well above the 10% level in all the cases we have studied .",
    "this suggests that the large - scale clustering of galaxies can not be used to infer the amplitude of mass fluctuations to few percent accuracy without detailed simulations of galaxy formation throughout large volumes .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of assembly bias to apparently minor details of halo formation history may make it impossible , even with simulations , to achieve robust results of the desired accuracy .",
    "galaxies are complex objects and they may not be suited to precision cosmology .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments .",
    "the authors are grateful to the virgo consortium , and in particular to volker springel , for the tremendous amount of work they invested to carry out the millennium simulation and to make its results available for analysis .",
    "gl also thanks carlos frenk , shaun cole , adrian jenkins and cedric lacey for stimulating discussions .",
    "we are grateful to eric hayashi for checking our numerical estimates of cross - correlations .",
