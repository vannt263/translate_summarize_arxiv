    "cell adhesion is mediated by the specific binding of a variety of membrane - anchored receptor and ligand molecules . in 1990 , springer suggested that the length difference of receptor - ligand complexes in the contact zone of immune cells may lead to segregation , _ i.e. _ to the formation of domains within the cell contact zone that contain receptor - ligand complexes with different lengths @xcite .",
    "the ` length ' of a receptor - complex here is the intermembrane distance , or local membrane separation at the site of the complex .",
    "a length difference between receptor - ligand complexes leads to an indirect , membrane - mediated repulsion of the complexes because the membranes have to bend to compensate the mismatch , which costs bending energy .",
    "important receptor - ligand complexes in t - cell adhesion are the tcr - mhcp complex with a length of about 13 nm @xcite , the cd2-cd48 complex with the same length of 13 nm @xcite , and the lfa1-icam1 complex with a length of about 40 nm @xcite . in 1998 and 1999 , the contact zone of t cells was indeed found to contain domains that either contain the short tcr - mhcp or the long lfa1-icam1 complexes @xcite . as expected from their length , the cd2-cd48 complexes are located within the tcr - mhcp domains @xcite . however , the question whether the domain formation is predominantly caused by the length mismatch of receptor - ligand complexes is complicated by the role of the actin cytoskeleton , which polarizes during t - cell adhesion and transports clusters of tcr - mhcp complexes towards the center of the cell contact zone @xcite , and by additional , direct protein - protein interactions @xcite .",
    "the domain formation is closely linked to t - cell activation , with trc clusters forming within seconds of t - cell adhesion triggering the first activation signals @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for a central role of the length of receptor - ligand complexes comes from experiments in which these lengths are altered by protein engineering @xcite .",
    "milstein and coworkers @xcite have considered variants of the protein cd48 with four and five immunoglobolin - like ( ig - like ) domains .",
    "the cd48 variants are longer than the cd48 wildtype , which contains only two ig - like domains .",
    "the cd48 wildtype and both cd48 variants bind to cd2 on t cells . from electron micrographs of the contact zone between t cells and supported membranes that contain one of the three cd48 types , milstein and coworkers found that the length of the cd2-cd48 complex is 12.8 @xmath0 1.4 nm for wildtype cd48 , 14.2 @xmath0 1.2 nm for the cd48 variant with four ig - like domains , and 15.6 @xmath0 1.4 nm for the variant with five ig - like domains . in fluorescence experiments of t cells on supported membranes that contain mixtures of two of the three cd48 types ,",
    "milstein and coworkers observed that cd2-cd48 wildtype complexes segregate from both cd2-cd48 variant complexes .",
    "the segregation seems to be driven by the length difference of the complexes since the t - cell cytoskeleton can only ` act on ' cd2 and , thus , can hardly ` discriminate ' between the different complexes",
    ". however , milstein and coworkers observe domain coexistence in the contact zone only within a narrow range of concentration ratios of cd48 wildtype and cd48 variants . for t cells adhering to supported membranes with mhcp and icam1 , in contrast , domain coexistence has been observed for a rather wide range of mhcp and icam1 concentrations and affinities @xcite .    in this article , we calculate detailed phase diagrams for cells adhering to supported membranes with anchored ligands .",
    "we consider two general adhesion scenarios : in the first scenario , long and short ligands in the supported membrane bind to the same cell receptor ( see section 4 ) , as in the experiments of milstein and coworkers @xcite , in which cd48 wildtype and a cd28 variant in the supported membrane both bind to cd2 in the t - cell membrane . in the second scenario ,",
    "two types of ligands in the supported membrane bind to two types of receptors in the cell membrane ( see section 5 ) , as in experiments in which mhcp and icam1 in the supported membrane bind to tcr and lfa1 in the t - cell membrane . we find a characteristic difference between the phase diagrams in the two scenarios ( see fig .  [ figure_phasediagrams ] ) . in the first scenario ,",
    "domain coexistence only occurs along a coexistence line . in the second scenario , in contrast",
    ", domain coexistence occurs in a wide coexistence region .",
    "our phase diagrams thus help to understand why milstein and coworkers observe domain coexistence only within a narrow range of concentration ratios .",
    "our calculations are based on a statistical - physical model of cell adhesion ( see section 2 ) . in this model ,",
    "the membranes are described as elastic sheets discretized into small patches that can contain single receptor or ligand molecules @xcite .",
    "the binding and domain formation of receptor - ligand complexes is affected by thermally excited shape fluctuations of the membranes on nanometer scales .",
    "these shape fluctuations lead to a critical point for the segregation of long and short receptor - ligand complexes @xcite .",
    "the critical point depends on the length difference of the complexes , on the concentrations and affinities of the receptors and ligands , and on the bending rigidity of the membranes ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the critical point constitutes a threshold for segregation , or domain formation , and may help to understand why milstein and coworkers have observed segregation of wildtype cd48 from each of the two cd48 variants , but not segregation of the two cd48 variants @xcite .",
    "in addition , the membrane shape fluctuations on nanoscales lead to a cooperative binding of receptor - ligand complexes @xcite ( see section 3 ) .",
    "cell adhesion involves length scales that differ by orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_cell_adhesion ] ) .",
    "the diameters of the cell and cell contact zone have values of several micrometers , while the average separation of the membranes within the contact zone is typically tens of nanometers .",
    "other important length scales in the cell contact zone are the average distance between receptor - ligand bonds , and the binding width of receptor and ligand molecules .",
    "the binding width is the difference between the smallest and the largest local membrane separation at which the molecules can bind .",
    "the binding width of the typically rather stiff receptor and ligand proteins that mediate cell adhesion is much smaller than the length of the proteins .",
    "the binding equilibrium and segregation of receptor - ligand complexes in cell contact zones is affected by membrane shape deformations and fluctuations .",
    "since bound receptor - ligand complexes constrain the local separation of the membranes , the relevant deformations and fluctuations of the membranes occur on lateral length scales smaller than the average distance between neighboring pairs of complexes , which is about 100 nanometers for complex concentrations of about 100 per square micrometer @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the elasticity of the membranes is dominated by their bending rigidity on these length scales .",
    "the binding rigidity @xmath1 dominates over the membrane tension @xmath2 on lateral length scales smaller than the crossover length @xmath3 @xcite , which is of the order of several hundred nanometers for cell membranes @xcite .",
    "the cytoskeletal elasticity @xcite contributes on length scales larger than the average distance between the cytoskeletal anchors in the membrane , which may be around 100 nanometers @xcite .",
    "the bending rigidity thus is likely to dominate over the lateral tension and the cytoskeletal elasticity on lateral length scales up to 100 nanometers relevant here .",

    ", the two apposing membranes in the contact zone of cells or vesicles are divided into small patches @xcite . in our models ,",

    "the linear size @xmath11 of the membrane patches is chosen to be around 5 nm to capture the whole spectrum of bending deformations of the lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "the ` effective bending rigidity ' of the two membranes with rigidities @xmath12 and @xmath13 is @xmath14 . if one of the membranes , e.g.  membrane 2 ,",
    "is a planar supported membrane , the effective bending rigidity @xmath1 equals the rigidity @xmath12 of the apposing membrane since the rigidity @xmath13 of the supported membrane is taken to be much larger than @xmath12 .",
    "the overall energy of the membranes in the cell contact zone @xmath15 is the sum of the elastic energy @xmath16 and interaction energy @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction energy depends on the distribution @xmath18 of the receptors in membrane 1 , on the distribution @xmath19 of the receptors in membrane 2 , and on the separation field @xmath20 of the membranes . in our models ,",
    "each patch of the discrete membranes can only be occupied by one receptor or ligand molecule .",
    "mobile receptor and ligand molecules diffuse by ` hopping ' from patch to patch , and the thermal fluctuations of the membranes are reflected in variations of the local separation of apposing membrane patches .",
    "a receptor can bind to a ligand molecule if the ligand is located in the membrane patch apposing the receptor , and if the local separation of the membranes is close to the length of the receptor - ligand complex ( see fig .  [ figure_model_one ] and below ) .",
