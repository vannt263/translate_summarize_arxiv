    "<S> the difference is due to the fact that the crystal field due to o - cr hybridization is stronger in the spin - majority channel where the energy separation between the oxygen @xmath25-states and the cr @xmath13states is smaller . </S>",

    "<S> the energy difference appears to be 3@xmath40 mev per two formula units , a very small number indeed . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that licro@xmath0 is a very good model material for studying frustrated magnetism in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> nacro@xmath0 maybe even a better example of the same physics , as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite from an experimental point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> let me now discuss magnetic interaction in plane . </S>",
    "<S> the above - described exchange splitting that renders licro@xmath0 a band insulator in lda calculations , being essentially a local effect , should be operative in an antiferro- , as well as in any ferrimagnetic arrangement . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> no new magnetic physics is introduced by mott - hubbard effects . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the antiferro- and ferrimagnetic calculations , described in more details below , i invariably found insulating ground states ( a corollary of this finding is that the magnetically disordered state above @xmath41 will be also insulating even in lda ) .    the isostructural compounds with higher transition metals ( co , ni ) , when order magnetically , assume the so - called a - type antiferromagnetism , that is , ferromagnetic planes , stacked antiferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanisms for the in - plane ferromagnetism are well understood : this is the classical 90@xmath42 superexchange , plus , in metallic compounds , like na@xmath43coo@xmath5 stoner ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> licro@xmath0 in not metallic , however , the o - cr - o bond angle is fairly close to 90@xmath33 and one expects the corresponding superexchange to be ferromagnetic .    </S>",
    "<S> a popular explanation@xcite is that this superexchange is indeed ferromagnetic but is surpassed by direct - overlap exchange between cr @xmath22-orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it was also pointed out@xcite that the o @xmath25 band in the higher metal ( co , ni ) is located higher with respect to the metal d - band , which enhances the @xmath3 hybridization and the superexchange , compared to that in licro@xmath1 while logical @xmath44 @xmath45 , however , neither of these propositions has been subjected to to a quantitative test . besides , although among the physicist dealing with transition metal oxides it is generally known that direct @xmath2 exchange is antiferromagnetic , this is not a trivial or obvious statement . </S>",
    "<S> suffice it to remind the reader that essentially all textbooks in solid state physics describe direct exchange in terms of the original heisenberg theory that in fact leads to the _ ferromagnetic _ interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to revisit the issue of the net sign of a direct exchange interaction from the local spin - density functional ( lsda ) point of view , which is the foundation of all quantitative investigations in this direction , and i refer the reader to the appendix where such an analysis is presented .    to address the nature of the magnetic interactions in licro@xmath0 , let us compare it with the isostructural linio@xmath1 lsda calculations predict in the latter a ferromagnetic exchange in plane , of the order of 5 mev@xcite . to compare with licro@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , i have performed lda calculations in a 2@xmath46 supercell , assuming three different magnetic patterns inside the plane : ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic ( alternating ferromagnetic chains running along 100 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ str ] ) , and ferrimagnetic , relatining the hexagonal symmetry by flipping one spin out of four ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ str ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results can be perfect well mapped onto the nearest neighbor ising model , yielding _ </S>",
    "<S> antiferromagnetic _ exchange @xmath47 mev ( 22 or 23 mev , depending on which two lines in table 1 are used ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is , of course , in excellent agreement with the experiment , but how does it answer to the theoretical conjectures described above ?         </S>",
    "<S> .lsda energies with respect to the energy of the fm state ( in mev ) , magnetic moments insides the cr mt spheres ( in @xmath48 ) , and excitation gaps ( in ev ) for several magnetic states in a quadruple 2@xmath492 licro@xmath50 supercell . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to this end , it is instructive to switch to a less accurate , but more flexible method , linear mt - orbitals ( lmto ) , which provides a capability of eliminating particular radial functions from the basis , and thus assessing effects of particular orbital overlaps on the bands . </S>",
    "<S> i have calculated the band structure of licro@xmath0 and linio@xmath0 removing all oxygen orbitals from the basis , so that the resulting d - band width is essentially coming from direct @xmath2 overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting band widths appear to be for licro@xmath12 and linio@xmath5 respectively , 1.4 ev and 0.5 ev , indicating that the direct @xmath2 overlap integrals for cr are three times large than for ni , in accord to earlier conjectures@xcite . comparing these numbers with the bandwidths in full calculations </S>",
    "<S> shows that in licro@xmath12 most of the total bandwidth is due to the direct overlap , while in linio@xmath0 it mainly comes from the indirect hopping @xmath36 oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> note that in some crude approximation this means that the direct exchange due to d - d overlap is an order of magnitude stronger in licro@xmath0 compared to linio@xmath1    let us now look at the o-@xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> metal @xmath22 energy separation . </S>",
    "<S> again , in lmto there is a gauge that can be readily used : separation between the corresponding band - center quasiatomic parameters . in licro@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> this separation appears to be 5.5 ev , while in linio@xmath0 it was 1.6 ev , 3.5 times smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a suppression ( albeit not by the same factor ) of the ferromagnetic _ _ super__exchange in the former compound , as proposed by khomskii@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is somewhat hard to estimate the actual reduction of this interaction , because the more diffuse character of the cr @xmath51 orbitals leads to some enhancement of the @xmath3 hopping compared to the ni compounds . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath3 overlap is already strong in the nickelate , this enhancement is not nearly as dramatic as that of the direct @xmath2 hopping , but it should be present .    </S>",
    "<S> the summary of this part is that while in the late 3d metal layered oxides , such as ( li , na)nio@xmath5 ( li , na)coo@xmath5 the relatively strong ferromagnetic interactions ( 90@xmath18 superexchange , but also stoner ferromagnetism , discussed below ) is largely , but not entirely compensated by the afm superexchange ( due to deviation from 90@xmath52 and by the direct @xmath2 afm exchange . in the early 3d metal oxides , ( li , na)cro@xmath5 the latter is greatly ( up to an order of magnitide ) enhanced , while the former is suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> i will now address the question of the relative importance of several factors favoring afm in - plane interactions in the early 3d oxides . </S>",
    "<S> two have already been mentioned , stronger deviation of the metal - oxugen - metal angle from 90@xmath18 ( @xmath53 in licro@xmath0 this angle is 94.6@xmath54 while in nanio@xmath0 is close to 92@xmath55 and stronger direct d - orbitlas overlap . </S>",
    "<S> there is a third important factor : the stoner magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in such a system as nanio@xmath5 where ni is a jahn - teller ions with an orbital degeneracy , the fermi level falls inside the @xmath24 band , which is wider in the fm case , and , correspondingly , has lower kinetic energy . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> itinerant @xmath24 electrons have more freedom to move in the crystals on a background of parallel magnetic moments ( one can also call this a d - d double exchange ; the difference is purely terminological ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that it does not matter if a small jahn - teller gap opens up in the @xmath24 band ; as long as this gap is smaller than or comparable to the band width , kinetic energy will still favor the fm arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> licro@xmath0 does not display any orbital degeneracy , thus lacking this contribution to the magnetic interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to try to get an idea of the relative importance of the two fm interactions . </S>",
    "<S> i attemted to address this issue by doing calculations for a hypothetical licro@xmath0 with oxygen octahedra unsqueezed so as to have cr - o - cr angle exactly 90@xmath56 while keeping the intraplane cr - cr distance constant ( otherwise the calculations proceeded exactly as for the experimental structure , as described above in table 1 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ str ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one may think that this procedure would substantially enhance the 90@xmath18 fm superexchange , hopefully keeping other magnetic interactions unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the result seems , on the first glance , unusual : the exchange interaction becomes _ more _ antiferromagnetic ( by about 17 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a closer look , however , reveals that this can be traced down to the fact that the equilibrium o - cr bond length in the afm structure appears to be longer than in the fm structure ( see fig.[phon ] ) , providing less hybridization and slightly smaller exchange splitting ; note that the afm energy gain due to the cr - cr direct exchange inversly depends on the exchange splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phon ] are practically rigidly shifted with respect to each other : the curvature is the same within the computational accuracy , corresponding to the frequency of the a@xmath57 phonon of 567 @xmath58 .     on the right </S>",
    "<S> calculated equilibrium positions are indicated by arrows . ]    finally , although one can expect that the role of the on - site mott - hubbard correlations should be small , given large widths of the cr d bands , it is of interest to estimate it using a standard implementation of the lda+u technique@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is most often used in one of the two flavors@xcite : one is designed to reporoduce the fully localized limit ( fll ) , the other simulates fluctuations around the mean - field solution ( amf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former is believed to be more appropriate for large @xmath39 system , and the latter for small @xmath39 s ( admittedly , in this regime the very concept of lda+u becomes questionable ) . </S>",
    "<S> i have estimated the parameters using the lmto internal quasiatomic loopmolodtsov to be @xmath59 ev , @xmath60 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is a moderate @xmath61 probably more on the amf side . </S>",
    "<S> because of that , i have performed lda+u calculations in both limits , in order to compare them with each other and with lda . the results ( assuming the fm structure ) </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ldau ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , lda+u does not introduce any new physics : the minimal gap is still the spin - flip gap between @xmath23 and @xmath62 enhanced by 0.@xmath63 ev in amf , due to a shift of the occupied band by @xmath64 , and by 1 ev in fll , due to an additional shift of the unoccupied states by the same amount . </S>",
    "<S> note that these shifts are smaller than those expected in a typical band insulator due to the well - known density - derivative discontinuity@xcite , related to an unscreened long - range exchange interaction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for zns , which has a gap of 3.8 ev , lda gives a gap of 1.7 - 1.8 ev . </S>",
    "<S> while i was not able to locate data for the experimental gap in licro@xmath0 , the optical gap in nacro@xmath50 was reported to be about 3.5 ev@xcite , thus making comparison with zns rather meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> note that the numbers in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ldau ] are for the fm ordering ; introduction of antiferromagnetism of course increases the gap ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> table 1 ) .     in lda and in two different lda+u flavors . </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) . ]    to conclude , one can describe licro@xmath0 as a weakly correlated band insulator with the minimal gap beng the spin - flip @xmath65 gap . </S>",
    "<S> magnetically it is a frustrated nearest - neighbor 2d triangular antiferromagnet , with a sizeable exchange constant of the order of 20 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> i would like to acknowledge many useful discussions with michelle johannes and daniel khomskii . </S>"
