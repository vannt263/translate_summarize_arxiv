    "the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets after ultrashort pulse excitation has been investigated experimentally and theoretically since its first observation 15 years ago .",
    "@xcite although a lot of progress has been made and a viable macroscopic model for the magnetization dynamics exists in the three - temperature model , there are still open questions regarding the underlying microscopic mechanism of the demagnetization as well as the details of the angular momentum transfer  @xcite on ultrashort timescales .",
    "additional interest in this topic is generated by its potential implications for laser - induced control of the magnetization and , possibly , all - optical switching .",
    "some promising microscopic explanations of magnetization dynamics involve mechanisms of the elliott - yafet type ,  @xcite in which the total spin polarization is reduced by scattering processes that change the average spin of the scattered electrons . in the presence of spin - orbit interaction",
    "this may be achieved by electron - phonon / impurity scattering ,  @xcite as is usually assumed , but also by electron - electron,@xcite electron - magnon,@xcite scattering .    to clarify the importance of electron - phonon scattering to the ultrafast demagnetization of ferromagnets",
    ", we recently investigated this scattering mechanism in bulk ferromagnets . by solving the dynamical equations for the momentum - resolved carrier distributions we showed that the electron - phonon scattering dynamics in the fixed band structure can not explain the observed magnetization dynamics for realistic pulse intensities .",
    "@xcite apart from the fixed band structure , our earlier calculation used a bath assumption for the phonon system and kept the lattice temperature fixed at the value before the excitation .",
    "after excitation with appreciable laser intensities , however , the electrons should transfer energy to the lattice quickly , leading to a rise in lattice temperature .",
    "the heating of the lattice should , in turn , affect the electronic dynamics because the available phase space for transitions in the phonon system is changed . here",
    ", we investigate this effect on the electronic dynamics by including the temperature of the phonon bath as an additional dynamical variable . as in ref .",
    ", the optical excitation and the electron - phonon scattering are described at the level of boltzmann scattering integrals , and the band structure , electron - phonon interaction matrix elements , as well as dipole matrix elements are calculated from density - functional theory .",
    "a detailed account of our numerical method including the connection to ab - initio calculations can be found in ref .  .",
    "in the following , we give a brief description of our theoretical approach , and show how a dynamical change of the phonon bath temperature is achieved in the framework of our model .",
    "we describe the ferromagnetic dynamics by momentum - resolved carrier distributions @xmath0 for all bands @xmath1 of interest , for which we integrate the dynamical equations @xmath2 with the following contributions from the optical excitation and electron - phonon scattering : @xmath3   \\label{eq : dndt_opt}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}n^{\\mu}_{\\vec{k}}\\bigr|_\\text{e - p}= &   \\sum_{\\nu,\\vec{k}'}\\mathcal{k}^{\\text{e - p}}_{\\mu,\\nu}(\\vec{k},\\vec{k ' } ) [ 1-n^{\\mu}_{\\vec{k } } ] n^{\\nu}_{\\vec{k}'}\\nonumber \\\\   & -\\sum_{\\nu,\\vec{k}'}\\mathcal{k}^{\\text{e - p}}_{\\nu,\\mu}(\\vec{k}',\\vec{k } ) n^{\\mu}_{\\vec{k}}[1-n^{\\nu}_{\\vec{k } ' } ]   \\label{eq : dndt_ep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 denotes the amplitude of the laser field . the scattering kernels @xmath5 and @xmath6 contain all the occupation independent quantities for the optical and the scattering contribution , respectively .",
    "@xcite the scattering kernels @xmath7 include the electron - phonon matrix elements , phonon and electron energy dispersions , and the phonon distributions",
    ". if one employs a bath approximation for the phonons and keeps the phonon temperature @xmath8 fixed , these scattering kernels are _ independent _ of time . in this paper",
    ", we still assume that the phonon system can be treated as a bath , but we characterize it by a time - dependent temperature @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to an implicit time dependence of the scattering kernel @xmath6 in eq .   because it depends on the phonon temperature via the phonon occupation numbers @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "here , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , and the phonon modes are labeled by their polarization @xmath12 and wave vector @xmath13 .",
    "the computation of @xmath14 for a given temperature of the phonon bath implies a sum over all allowed transitions weighted by the corresponding phonon occupation numbers . instead of redoing this summation in eq .",
    "in every numerical time step , which would vastly increase the cpu time demands , we note the smooth , monotonic dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath8 , which suggests also a smooth dependence of their weighted sum @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore approximately replace @xmath14 by a polynomial of degree @xmath16 which can be obtained from a least squares fit to values @xmath14 precomputed for a `` grid '' of temperatures in the temperature interval of interest @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamical equation of the temperature @xmath8 of the phonon bath is derived from the requirement of energy conservation , which holds for the system of electrons and phonons if one neglects losses to the environment .",
    "that is , a change in energy of the electronic system @xmath18 should lead to an equal , but opposite , change in the energy of the phonon system @xmath19 , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy of single - particle state @xmath22 and @xmath23 the scattering contribution to the occupation change as in eq .  . finally , the phonon heat capacity @xmath24 is computed using the phonon frequencies @xmath25 obtained from an ab - initio calculation .",
    "@xcite as @xmath26 also smoothly depends on the temperature @xmath8 , it is replaced in the numerical calculations by an polynomial approximation for the same set of `` grid '' points as @xmath14 .",
    "the combined set of dynamical equations for the electronic distributions , eq .  , and the temperature @xmath8 of the phonon bath , eq  , is solved numerically . from the solution",
    ", the magnetization of the system can be obtained by the sum @xmath27 over the spin expectation values @xmath28 of the states  @xmath29 , neglecting orbital contributions to the magnetization . here",
    "@xmath30 denotes the bohr magneton .",
    "we apply the model and calculation procedure described in the previous section to the simple ferromagnets nickel and iron , and compare with our earlier results  @xcite that assumed a constant temperature of the phonon bath .",
    "the parameters were chosen as in ref .  .",
    "for the polynomial interpolations , we evaluated @xmath6 and @xmath31 for 40 equidistant temperatures in the range from 250 to 1000k , and used an interpolation with third and fifth degree polynomials , respectively .",
    "the results shown in figs .  1 and  2 for nickel and iron , respectively , are computed assuming the same pulse intensity of 4 mj/@xmath32 , from which the amplitude of the electric field in the material is obtained by material specific values for the complex refractive index .",
    "the optical excitation leads to a deposition of energy in the material that is quite similar for both nickel and iron , cf .  figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "the experimentally observed differences between nickel  @xcite and iron  @xcite at the same pump fluence are therefore not simply due to a different `` net '' energy transfer to the ferromagnet by the ultrashort pulse .",
    "the magnetization dynamics exhibits a rapid drop with different time constants for iron and nickel of less than 250fs , and a subsequent return to an equilibrium state on a time scale of 10ps .",
    "the demagnetization occurs via the so - called the elliott - yafet mechanism : the spin mixing due to the spin - orbit interaction leads to a change of the carriers average spin in each scattering event and thus to a change of magnetization . on the longer time - scale",
    "the carrier distributions approach again an equilibrium fermi - dirac form and thus lead to a return of the magnetization towards an equilibrium value .    as stressed in ref .",
    ", the computed magnetization dynamics should be compared to experimental results  @xcite on a sub - picosecond timescale , because changes in the quasi - equilibrium magnetization ( exchange splitting ) , which dominate the dynamics on a picosecond timescale , see , e.g. , ref .  ,",
    "are excluded from our model due to the fixed band structure .",
    "we also neglect carrier - carrier scattering  @xcite which leads to an additional relaxation towards quasi - equilibrium distributions .",
    "the combination of `` magnetic '' dynamics and electron - electron scattering likely prevents the occurrence of a dynamical magnetization larger than its equilibrium value , as it is the case for nickel around 4ps in our simulation .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) indicate that the dynamical changes in the temperature of the phonon bath have no pronounced influence on the ultrafast magnetization dynamics .",
    "still , the calculation including a time - dependent temperature of the phonon bath yields a slightly accelerated magnetization dynamics on the ultrafast timescale because the heating of the phonon bath increases the scattering rates .",
    "our calculated results on a timescale of a few picoseconds should be interpreted strictly as a model study .",
    "1(b),(c ) and 2(b),(c ) show that the `` heating dynamics '' of nickel and iron are very similar , even though the magnetization dynamics are distinctly different . in both materials ,",
    "the system reaches a steady state on a timescale of several ( ten ) picoseconds when the temperature of the phonon bath is allowed to change dynamically .",
    "this steady state is characterized by a heated phonon system and an higher energy ( density ) of the electron system , because system does not reach the initial equilibrium distribution at @xmath33 , but instead one at the higher final temperature , which corresponds to a higher energy ( density ) . for nickel , as shown in fig .  1 , the dynamical phonon temperature even rises above the curie temperature ( @xmath34)@xcite . the deposited energy of about @xmath35 is therefore enough to completely demagnetize the material after thermalization .",
    "such a full demagnetization is not observed in experiment at the given intensity , which indicates that the constant amplitude of the optical field assumed by us is an overestimation . in the experiment",
    "the field is attenuated due to absorption in the sample .",

    "we presented an ab - initio based calculation of electron - phonon scattering dynamics with a dynamical temperature of the phonon bath for nickel and iron , which constitutes a more realistic description of a thin film weakly coupled to a substrate than the fixed temperature of the phonon bath used in a previous study .",
    "@xcite in the framework of this model , which uses a fixed band structure , we compared the resulting demagnetization scenario with constant and time - dependent temperature of the phonon bath to estimate the influence of the phonon temperature on the dynamics .",
    "we find only marginal changes in the magnetization dynamics .",
    "this supports our earlier conclusion  @xcite that electron - phonon scattering in a constant band structure is not able to explain the pronounced observed demagnetization for realistic laser intensities .",
    "our results provide a hint that a dynamical phonon - bath temperature is unlikely to play an important role in the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets . based on our results",
    ", we conclude that a dynamical change of the band structure , i.e. , the exchange splitting has to be taken into account to achieve a quantitative understanding of ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in ferromagnets .",
