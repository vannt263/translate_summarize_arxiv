    "in a quantum channel , information is encoded in a set of quantum states , which are in general nonorthogonal and thus , even in principle , can not be observed without disturbance .",
    "therefore , their faithful transmission requires that the entire communication protocol is carried out by a physical apparatus that works without knowing or learning anything about the travelling signal . in this respect ,",
    "quantum teleportation provides a remarkable mean for indirectly sending quantum states .",
    "the key ingredient of quantum teleportation is an entangled bipartite state used to support the quantum communication channel @xcite .",
    "this allows the preparation of an arbitrary quantum state at a distant place without directly transmitting it . in optical implementations of continuous variables quantum teleportation ( cvqt ) ,",
    "the entangled source is typically a twin - beam state of radiation ( twb ) , whose two modes are shared between the two parties .",
    "a faithful transmission of quantum information through the channel requires a large input - output fidelity , which in turn is an increasing function of the amount of entanglement .",
    "however , the propagation of a twb in noisy channels unavoidably leads to degradation of entanglement , due to decoherence induced by losses and noise .",
    "indeed , the effect of decoherence on twb entanglement and , in turn , on teleportation fidelity , have been addressed by many authors @xcite .",
    "thresholds for separablity of twb have been established and teleportation of both classical and nonclassical states has been explicitly analyzed @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was investigated how much nonclassicality can be transferred by noisy teleportation in a zero temperature thermal bath .",
    "moreover , the stability of squeezed states in a squeezed environment has been recently studied , showing that such nonclassical states loose their coherence faster than coherent states even if coupled with nonclassical reservoir @xcite .",
    "the open question is then if there exist situations where squeezed states are favoured with respect to coherent ones , especially for quantum communication purporses .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the behavior of a twb propagating through a gaussian noisy channel , either thermal or squeezed - thermal , and address its performances for applications in quantum communication @xcite .",
    "as we will see , in presence of noise along the channel , teleportation of a suitable class of squeezed states can be an effective and robust protocol for amplitude - based communication compared to direct transmission .",
    "squeezed environments were addressed by many authors for preservation of the macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "in fact , if squeezed quantum fluctuations are added to dissipation , a macroscopic superposition state preserves its coherence longer than in presence of dissipation alone @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite showed that the interference fringes due to a superposition of two macroscopically distinct coherent states ( `` schrdinger s cat states '' ) could be improved by the inclusion of squeezed vacuum fluctuations .",
    "an interesting physical realization of an environment with squeezed quantum fluctuations based on quantum - non - demolition - feedback was proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "effective squeezed - bath interactions were studied in references @xcite , where the technique of quantum - reservoir engineering @xcite was actually used to couple a pair of two - state atoms to an _ effective _ squeezed reservoir .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sections [ s : interaction ] and [ s : sep ] we describe the evolution of a twb in a squeezed - thermal bath and study its separability by means of the partial transposition criterion ; section [ s : tele ] addresses the twb coupled with the non classical environment as a resource for quantum teleportation of squeezed states ; in section [ s : comm ] we compare the performances of direct transmission and teleportation . in section [ s : conclusions ] we draw some concluding remarks .",
    "the propagation of a twb interacting with a squeezed - thermal bath can be modelled as the coupling of each part of the state with a non - zero temperature squeezed reservoir .",

    "<S> we find that the threshold for purely thermal channels is always larger than for squeezed - thermal ones . on the other hand , we show that squeezing the channel improves teleportation of squeezed states and , in particular , we find the class of squeezed states that are better teleported in a given noisy channel . finally , we find regimes where optimized teleportation of squeezed states improves amplitude - modulated communication in comparison with direct transmission . </S>"
