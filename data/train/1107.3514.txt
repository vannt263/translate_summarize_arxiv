    "t tauri stars ( tts ) are pre - main sequence low mass stars frequently described as young analogs of our solar system .",
    "surrounded by circumstellar disks of gas and dust , these systems mark the earliest stages of planet - formation , a process now understood to be common in our galaxy @xcite . due to their close proximity to the parent star",
    ", intense ultraviolet and x - ray radiation fields greatly impact the evolution of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv , @xmath4ev ) field is of particularly broad interest as it provides thermodynamical gas heating through the photoelectric effect @xcite , and affects disk chemistry directly through the photo - dissociation and -ionization of molecules and atoms ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "fuv photodesorption of ices contributes to the transport of material between solid and gas phases , whilst enabling complex molecule formation on grains surfaces @xcite . alongside x - rays and cosmic - rays ,",
    "the fuv field is also involved in the ionization balance of the disk ; of central importance in dynamical processes such as the magneto - rotational instability that is believed to play a role in accretion @xcite .",
    "eventually the dispersal of disk gas may be driven by uv photo - evaporation @xcite , although resolving the contributions made by the separate fuv , euv and x - ray components is still a matter of debate @xcite    one feature of the fuv spectra in t tauri systems which separates the accretors from the non - accretors , is a strong , broad @xmath0 line ( accounting for as much as 80% of the total fuv luminosity ) . in nearby systems such as tw hydra the @xmath0 line can be detected directly @xcite , whilst in obscured systems its presence may be inferred through the excitation of @xmath5 molecules @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that the concentration of uv photons in a relatively narrow wavelength range ( @xmath6  ) would have important implications for wavelength - dependent chemical processes , specifically the photodissociation of molecules @xcite .",
    "for example , the molecules hcn , oh , h@xmath7o and h@xmath7co can all be photodissociated by a @xmath0 photon , unlike the closely related species cn , oh@xmath8 , h@xmath7o@xmath8 and hco@xmath8 ( for a more complete list , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "abundance ratios frequently used as chemical diagnostics , such as @xmath9 , will be changed ( in this case increased ) by @xmath0-dominated photodissociation .",
    "@xcite have shown quantitatively that the inclusion of differential photodissociation by @xmath0 can some instances help bring abundance ratios into better agreement with observation @xcite . while the the presence of @xmath0 decreases the abundance of hcn , nh@xmath10 , and ch@xmath11 by an order of magnitude or more , other species such as co@xmath7 and so are enhanced .",
    "so actually has a significant cross - section at 1216@xmath12 , however so does so@xmath7 , and it is the photodissociation of so@xmath7 which partially replenishes the so abundance . in this instance , the presence of @xmath0 actually increases the so abundance .",
    "similarly , the abundances of h@xmath7o and oh in the @xcite models increased with the introduction of @xmath0 , even though both h@xmath7o and oh have a significant photodissociation cross - sections at 1216@xmath12 . in this case the gas phase abundances are more than adequately replenished by efficient @xmath0 photodesorption from grain surfaces .",
    "further chemical modeling is required before the implications of @xmath0-dominated photochemistry are fully understood .    despite the interesting chemical implications of a @xmath0 dominated fuv field , the problem of precisely how it penetrates",
    "the disk has received little attention in the literature . in this paper",
    "we attempt to shed light upon its basic transport .",
    "although frequently flared , protoplanetary disks remain relatively flat objects with vertical scaleheights that are small compared to the radial extent of the disk @xcite . as a result",
    ", the majority of the mass ( residing near to the disk midplane ) is concealed from the parent star .",
    "visual optical depths at the midplane , measured along lines directly from the star , typically exceed @xmath13 , implying that essentially no stellar photons can penetrate these parts directly . instead , radiation must be scattered downwards from the surface of the disk @xcite .",
    "scattering is therefore of central importance when discussing the transport of stellar radiation in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the penetration and absorption of x - ray and fuv radiation determines much of the thermodynamical stratification of the upper disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for simplicity",
    "we can identify three layers ; the uppermost layer being a photodissociation layer illuminated directly by the intense , unattenuated stellar radiation field - this layer is dominated by atoms , since the photodissociation timescale of molecules is very short .",
    "as unscattered photons penetrate into the disk they eventually reach an irradiation surface , defined to be where the optical depth integrated from the star is of order unity , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is here that , in an average sense , photons undergo their first interactions with the disk . in the case of interactions with dust grains , this results in attenuation through both absorption and scattering ; the latter leading to the emergence of a diffuse component to the radiation field .",
    "since the radiation field decreases with depth , while the local mass density increases , we eventually enter an intermediate warm molecular layer , where @xmath5 , co and a host of other gas - phase molecules may exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the photodissociating fuv field .",
    "it is in this warm molecular layer that the photochemical processes are most important . despite its attenuation ,",
    "the radiation field is sufficient to maintain grain temperatures above @xmath15k , thus preventing widespread freeze - out of molecules onto grain surfaces . at even greater depths",
    "we enter the optically thick , dense midplane region containing @xmath16 of the disk mass . here",
    "the stellar fuv field is highly attenuated and consists entirely of scattered photons . with the exception of the innermost few au ,",
    "the temperatures may be low enough ( @xmath17k ) to permit the freeze - out of several molecular species @xcite .",
    "the transport of fuv photons is further complicated by the gradual growth and settling of dust grains as the disk evolves towards planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "not only does grain - growth affect the optical properties of individual grains , but the radial and vertical drift of solids relative to gas causes a segregation of the grain - size population @xcite .",
    "the majority of the grain opacity at fuv wavelengths is attributable to relatively small grains with radii @xmath18 m , which subsequently reemit absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths , making it possible to estimate their abundance @xcite .",
    "observationally , the abundance of small grains ( per h nucleus ) relative to that found in the ism , @xmath19 , typically takes a value much less than one ; for example , in the taurus star - forming region the median value is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "our basic picture of fuv transport is somewhat incomplete once we include @xmath0 photons . in view of the large cross - section due to resonant scattering by h atoms , @xmath21",
    ", it seems entirely plausible that @xmath0 photons experience their first interactions not with dust grains but with h atoms residing in the uppermost photodissociation layer of the disk ( hereafter ` h - layer ' ) .",
    "the irradiation surface for @xmath0 photons is therefore defined as the location where @xmath22 .",
    "the precise location depends quite sensitively on the width of the stellar @xmath0 line profile , although the @xmath0 photons that propagate freely to the disk surface are generally those in the wings of the scattering line profile presented by the disk @xcite .",
    "even hundreds of doppler widths out in the lorentz wings of the scattering line profile the cross - section may still be significantly larger than that due to the ( possibly settled ) dust population .",
    "figure [ fig : voigt ] shows the @xmath0 line from tw hya , plotted next to an estimate of the scattering line profile due to warm h atoms in the disk . assuming the photodissociation layer supports h columns of @xmath23@xmath24 ( integrated along a line from the star )",
    ", it seems probable that the @xmath0 field will first be scattered by this atomic h - layer . the optical depth of dust in this layer",
    "will be smaller by a factor of approximately @xmath25 .",
    "in stark contrast to @xmath0 transport , fuv - continuum photons will stream unimpeded through the h - layer , eventually striking the disk at the conventional irradiation surface defined by dust . here",
    "they will begin to scatter , however scattering by typical interstellar dust populations is considered to be somewhat forward - throwing @xcite .",
    "multiple scatterings are therefore required before an appreciably diffuse component is generated , and accompanying this scattering will be a degree of pure absorption .    in this paper",
    "we explore numerically the basic phenomenology of resonantly scattered @xmath0 in disk models .",
    "an emphasis is placed on contrasting the transport of @xmath0 with that of the fuv - continuum field in the vicinity of the @xmath0 line .",
    "we proceed with section [ sec : disks ] where we discuss the properties of our disk models .",
    "radiation transfer of @xmath0 and fuv - continuum photons is dealt with in section [ sec : radiative - transfer ] .",
    "this includes an approximate - but largely self - consistent -computation of the h distribution necessary for @xmath0 transport .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion and summary .",
    "we base our disk structures on a suite of three disk models from @xcite .",
    "the disks are differentiated by the depletion of small grains in their upper layers , @xmath26 .",
    "physically , the parameter @xmath19 represents the ratio of dust concentration relative to that found in the interstellar medium . although the models include the effects of dust depletion on the hydrostatic disk structure , they lack a separate thermodynamic treatment of the gas , which becomes thermally decoupled at the low densities found in the disk atmosphere . while the dalessio et al .",
    "disks suffice for illustrating the essential features of @xmath0 and fuv - continuum transport , a more self - consistent treatment will eventually require the inclusion of detailed coupling between the radiative transfer , thermodynamics and disk structure .",
    "several disk models exist that already include the thermal decoupling of gas and dust that generally leads to larger disk scaleheights ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assign a nominal fuv luminosity of @xmath27 to the central star and a kinetic temperature of @xmath28k to the gas in the upper layers of the disk . in view of these modifications",
    "we refer to the models as ` modified dalessio disks ' .",
    "a cross - section of the total hydrogen density , @xmath29 , in one of the disk models is shown in figure [ fig : nh_map ] .",
    "the grain - size distribution used in the original dalessio calculations follows @xcite , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the grain radius .",
    "in fact there are two populations of grains ( ` large ' and ` small ' ) in the dalessio models , however the large grains are confined to the disk midplane and play no role in what follows . for the ` small ' grain population",
    "the grain - size limits are @xmath32 m and @xmath33 m ( double check this ) .",
    "these limits are consistent with those proposed by @xcite for interstellar grains .",
    "relevant optical properties of the ` small ' grain population are shown in figure [ fig : dust_properties ] . in this paper",
    "we are primarily concerned with fuv - continuum wavelengths in the vicinity of @xmath34 . at this wavelength",
    "the ` small ' grain population exhibits an appreciably forward - throwing phase function ( asymmetry factor of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the widely used henyey - greenstein phase functions @xcite evaluated for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are shown in figure [ fig : hg ] .    the computational domain used for the subsequent radiative transfer simulations comprises the modified dalessio disks immersed in a background mesh .",
    "the modified dalessio disks are spatially 1 + 1d datasets ; the purpose of the background grid of nodes is to transform these models into true 2d distributions .",
    "the resulting discretization consists of a list of nodes , each of which has associated with it a location as well as relevant physical quantities ( e.g. densities ) which are interpolated from the original dalessio models .",
    "the background mesh supports unstructured distributions of nodes in order to accommodate spatially irregular datasets such as the dalessio models . to the extent possible , the initial background grid exhibits grid refinement such that its spatial resolution matches that of the dalessio data .",
    "the nodes ( constrained to lie in the @xmath38 plane in a cylindrical coordinate system ) ultimately form the vertices of triangular cells .",
    "figures [ fig : grid_adaptive ] and [ fig : grid_inner ] give the reader an impression of the spatial distribution of nodes and how they result in a tessellation of triangular cells . the triangular cells are a result of the connectivity obtained by performing a delaunay tessellation on the node list . in 2d",
    "the triangle is the simplex : the simplest shape that can tessellate the volume @xcite . in 3d",
    "the simplex is the tetrahedron .",
    "there are many alternative ways to connect the nodes that give rise to a sensible tessellation of triangular cells , however the delaunay tessellation has unique properties that arguably yield the optimal connectivity .",
    "first , the connections link those nodes that compete for space .",
    "this is most easily understood by considering the corresponding voronoi diagram ( the dual of the delaunay tessellation ) .",
    "second , the resulting triangles maximize the minimum internal angle , thus reducing the frequency of skinny triangles . while the meshes in figs .",
    "[ fig : grid_adaptive ] and [ fig : grid_inner ] ostensibly appear regular , they are treated as fundamentally unstructured .",
    "had the background mesh been cast randomly ( e.g. according to a poisson point process ) it would be possible to shed all traces of the underlying coordinate system in the spatial discretization @xcite . for these reasons the delaunay tessellation is becoming an attractive choice for generating high - quality , unstructured discretizations of spatial objects .",
    "very few radiative transfer problems of astrophysical interest can be solved analytically without resorting to significant simplifications @xcite .",
    "the transport of radiation in protoplanetary disks is no exception . in view of the geometrical complexity and assortment of opacity sources , we opt to solve the transport problem using the highly versatile monte carlo simulation method .",
    "numerical details of our monte carlo radiative transfer code are described in the appendices . in this section",
    "we restrict the discussion to aspects which are relevant to the physical context .",
    "the transport of fuv - continuum photons is assumed to be governed solely by interactions with dust grains . at extreme levels of dust settling ( @xmath39 )",
    "it is possible that rayleigh scattering by @xmath5 molecules becomes relatively important .",
    "anisotropic scattering by grains is treated using the one - parameter henyey - greenstein phase function , the angular scattering probability distribution of which is given by ,    @xmath40^{3/2}}.\\label{eq : hg}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 $ ] is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "isotropic scattering corresponds to @xmath42 , forwards scattering to @xmath43 , and backwards scattering to @xmath44 ( figure [ fig : hg ] ) .",
    "the single - scattering albedo @xmath45 indicates that these grains have a slight preference towards absorption rather than scattering . from @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "we can conclude that multiple scatterings will be required in order to generate a diffuse field that can penetrate the disk vertically .",
    "accompanying these scatterings will be significant absorption .",
    "the transport of @xmath0 is treated like fuv - continuum but with the addition of resonant scattering .",
    "accordingly , it is necessary to first determine the distribution of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the formation of @xmath5 in dense , dusty environments usually occurs on the surfaces of dust grains @xcite .",
    "the destruction of @xmath5 occurs with @xmath49% probability following an absorption of a fuv photon into the lyman - werner band system ( @xmath50 , * ? ? ?",
    "since the photodissociation of @xmath5 occurs through line absorptions , these transitions become optically thick over very modest columns , @xmath51@xmath24 . beyond this point",
    "we see a run - away formation of ` self - shielded ' @xmath5 . while any photo - destruction dominated process that competes with formation can in principle result in self - shielding @xcite , the concentration of @xmath5 opacity in discrete lines makes it readily self - shielding . balancing formation and destruction rates",
    "gives the steady - state molecular fraction @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the high temperature @xmath5 formation rate coefficient @xcite , and @xmath54 is the @xmath5 photodissociation rate @xmath55 $ ] . for the self - shielding function , @xmath56 $ ] ,",
    "we adopt the closed - form expression from @xcite , although comparison simulations were also performed using the tabulated results of @xcite .",
    "these approximations were shown to result in h - layers with comparable geometries and column densities . in the context of our monte carlo simulation",
    "we evaluate the self - shielding function along the length of each photon packet trajectory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the inclusion of a full treatment of @xmath5 photodissociation is currently beyond the capabilities of most multidimensional photochemical codes @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the h/@xmath5 distribution is an iterative one , since to compute @xmath57 at a point requires us to know the degree of self - shielding due to @xmath57 everywhere else .",
    "an initial distribution of h and h@xmath7 is required to start the iterative calculation . from this our @xmath5 will ` grow ' as self - shielding is established over the course of repeated iterations . ideally , this initial condition should be constructed to underestimate the @xmath5 density : if @xmath5 is overestimated then regions that are artificially self - shielded will be slowly photodissociated away over the course of the iterative process . in such over - shielded cases , a layer of excess h@xmath7 with a thickness corresponding approximately to the self - shielding column ( @xmath58@xmath24 )",
    "will be photodissociated in each iteration .",
    "if the excess @xmath5 is distributed over a large volume , the convergence towards the true h@xmath7 distribution will be very slow .",
    "since the introduction of self - shielding always _ increases _ the h@xmath7 density , we can set a strict lower limit by computing @xmath57 using eqn [ eq : h2 ] ignoring all forms of shielding ( this includes dust attenuation , although we retain the geometrical inverse - square dilution of radiation ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath59 is shown in the left - hand panel in figure [ fig : grid_adaptive ] . even without self - sheilding ,",
    "atomic hydrogen is limited to the upper disk layers due solely to the increase in density that promotes h@xmath7 formation deep in the disk .",
    "the iterative process commences with a full radiative transfer simulation at a single representative lyman - werner band wavelength ( centered at @xmath60 ) .",
    "the accumulation of h@xmath7 column density along photon packet trajectories is recorded , and information regarding the self - shielded radiation field is deposited in each cell traversed by the photon packet . dust scattering and absorption",
    "are both included .",
    "however , since @xmath5 shielding proceeds so vigorously , dust shielding plays a relatively minor role in determining the final h/@xmath5 distribution .",
    "this is especially true in dust - settled scenarios , although a rigorous consideration must establish the criteria that separates purely @xmath5 self - shielding situations from those in which @xmath5 self - shielding is initiated by dust attenuation @xcite .    once approximately @xmath61 photon packets have been run , the resulting self - shielded radiation field is used to compute a new @xmath57 using eqn [ eq : h2 ] .",
    "since the original grid is generally too coarse to properly resolve the emerging h / h@xmath7 transition we refine the grid before proceeding with a new iteration .",
    "if the @xmath5 distribution is described on grid that is too coarse , individual cells may self - shield , causing a local overestimation of @xmath62 that may subsequently propagate through the grid .",
    "the refinement criterion is based upon the fractional change in @xmath57 between iterations .",
    "this ensures that the spatial resolution of the grid is increased in regions which are most sensitive to changes in @xmath57 .",
    "regions that are either entirely unshielded or totally self - shielded ( @xmath63 ) will not receive grid refinement .",
    "the refinement of a cell is achieved by placing a single node in the geometric center of the cell .",
    "once new nodes have been added a delaunay tessellation is performed on the augmented node list , resulting a new set of cells .",
    "physical quantities are interpolated onto this new grid and the next iteration cycle is begun .    the criteria for a converged solution must not only require a solution that does not change significantly with further iterations , but",
    "also that every cell in the h/@xmath5 transition must not contain a sufficiently large @xmath64 to self - shield all by itself .",
    "for a cell to be considered part of the h/@xmath5 transition it must exhibit a @xmath57 that is greater than its unshielded value and less than its maximal possible value of @xmath65 .",
    "the nodes and @xmath59 distributions after the first and second iterations in the @xmath66 model are shown in figure [ fig : grid_adaptive ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the uppermost layers are entirely photodissociated so that @xmath67 throughout the iterative procedure .",
    "it is the _ lower _ boundary of the h layer that is affected by self - shielding , and this can be seen to rise in height as the bulk of the disk gradually becomes molecular . for the modified dalessio disks we typically undertake 15 - 20 iterations .",
    "convergence is assumed when @xmath57 changes by less than 5% everywhere in the domain .",
    "it is important to realize that monte carlo noise will generate variance between iterations , even after many iterations .",
    "if the monte carlo noise level is known then eqn [ eq : h2 ] can be used to estimate its effect on @xmath57 .    to summarize ,",
    "the basic steps of the iterative h@xmath7 calculation are as follows ;    1 .",
    "compute an initial distribution ( lower limit ) of h@xmath7 due to dissociation by the unattenuated stellar field ( i.e. ignoring @xmath5 self - shielding and dust attenuation ) .",
    "2 .   propagate photon packets using monte carlo methods , following @xmath5 self - shielding and dust - absorption along trajectories .",
    "compute new h@xmath7 distribution due to this photodissociation field .",
    "4 .   add nodes to regions where the h / h@xmath7 transition is detected .",
    "interpolate physical properties onto the new mesh . 5 .",
    "repeat from step 2 until solution has converged .",
    "once the h - layer has been calculated it is possible to propagate @xmath0 photons .",
    "the resonant scattering process is simplified somewhat by associating with it a voigt line profile , @xmath68 , and an isotropic phase function . @xcite and",
    "@xcite discuss the treatment of resonant @xmath69 transitions in more detail , although for our purposes the simplified treatment is sufficient . as discussed previously , most @xmath0 photons from the tw hya spectrum scatter in the lorentzian wings of the voigt profile ( see figure [ fig : voigt ] ) . unlike the doppler core , which is relatively temperature sensitive , the wings of the scattering profile do not change greatly with the temperature of the gas .",
    "this somewhat mitigates the ad hoc temperature imposed upon the gas in our modified dalessio disks .",
    "the convolution of the gaussian ( thermal broadening ) and lorentz ( natural ) line profiles gives rise to the voigt profile ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the oscillator strength for the the @xmath72 transition , @xmath73 is the electron charge , @xmath74 the speed of light , and @xmath75 the electron mass .",
    "@xmath76 is the thermal doppler width , where @xmath77 is the mean thermal velocity of the scatterers and @xmath78 is the frequency at line center .",
    "@xmath79 is the voigt profile defined by the integral ,    @xmath80    while the scattering is coherent in the frame of the scattering atom , an overall frequency change occurs due to the difference between the incoming and outgoing doppler shifts required to change between atom and disk frames .",
    "this is known as partial frequency redistribution @xcite .",
    "the fractional change in photon frequency is of order the thermal doppler width @xmath76 where @xmath77 is",
    "the mean thermal velocity of the scatterers and @xmath78 is the frequency at line center . partial redistribution of the scattered @xmath0 photon is included in our code using microscopic monte carlo techniques based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , since the intrinsic stellar @xmath0 line shape is already very broad ( @xmath81 doppler widths , see fig .",
    "[ fig : voigt ] ) , and the h - layer not extremely optically thick , little appreciable frequency redistribution of the @xmath0 line is expected .",
    "as such one can largely ignore frequency redistribution in our models , and instead treat the resonant scattering as elastic . this simplification greatly expedites the calculation .",
    "we ignore systematic doppler shifts due to the azimuthal velocity component of the disk ( @xmath82kms@xmath83 at 1au , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since for much of the disk this induces doppler shifts that are modest compared to the stellar @xmath0 line width ( @xmath84kms@xmath83 ) .",
    "the vertical distribution of hydrogen in the three disk models is shown in figure [ fig : columns ] .",
    "the molecular hydrogen column density @xmath64 shows the characteristic s - shape associated with the onset of self - shielding as we descend into the disk .",
    "the vertical column density of atomic hydrogen clearly varies with the degree of dust depletion , @xmath85 - this is the column thickness of the h - layer that scatters @xmath0 photons .",
    "thicker h - layers are associated with dust depleted models , due to the proportional reduction in the @xmath86 formation rate .",
    "the precipitous drop in @xmath59 seen in figure [ fig : columns ] is indicative of the sudden onset of @xmath5 self - shielding .",
    "the _ vertical _ optical depth ( for resonant scattering ) of the h - layer depends upon the wavelength displacement from line center ; for the @xmath0 spectrum shown in figure [ fig : voigt ] the photon - averaged optical depths are @xmath87 for @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "although these vertical optical depths are not large , when viewed from the star the _ slant _ optical depth this h - layer is typically @xmath89 and thus _ the h - layer will intercept essentially every stellar @xmath0 photon incident upon it_. we are mostly interested in following the portion of @xmath0 emerging from the lower surface of the h - layer .",
    "the remainder is scattered into space from the upper surface .",
    "it is worth noting that the h - layer is not so optically thick to these line - wing photons that they become line - trapped and destroyed by dust absorption @xcite .",
    "while these results suggest that resonant scattering of @xmath0 is indeed important , the h - layers computed lack the self - consistency required to render them entirely realistic .",
    "figure [ fig : maps ] shows spatial maps providing a visual comparison of the @xmath0 and fuv - continuum photon densities in the @xmath66 modified dalessio disk .",
    "in addition to the photon density @xmath90 we also show flux arrows ( direction only ) , and the anisotropy of the field @xmath91 ( the ratio of net flux to photon density ) . the highly flared h - layer and its isotropizing effect on the @xmath0 field is clearly seen in the left - hand anisotropy panel .",
    "the net flux of transmitted @xmath0 photons emerges from the h - layer perpendicularly , providing a more direct illumination of the disk below .",
    "vertical profiles of the @xmath92fuv - continuum photon density ratio are shown in figure [ fig : ratios ] for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , at radii @xmath95 and @xmath96au .",
    "the same qualitative behavior of the ratio is seen at all radii , although the quantitative effect is greatest in the inner disk .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : ratios ] that the h - layer is fuv - continuum dominated , whereas the molecular disk ( and therefore the vast majority of disk mass ) is @xmath0-dominated .",
    "ultimately , the enhancement of the @xmath0 photon density ( above the intrinsic stellar value ) may exceed an order of magnitude .",
    "the ratios eventually asymptote to a constant value deep into the disk where both fields are approaching the diffusive limit and therefore behaving similarly .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath19 , essentially every stellar @xmath0 photon is intercepted by the highly flared h - layer . upon the first scattering the @xmath0 field",
    "is completely isotropized and a fraction @xmath97is transmitted through to the base h - layer .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] ( top left and bottom left panels ) . viewed from within the molecular region the @xmath0 would seem to originate in a diffuse blanket overlying the disk , analogous to the diffuse transport of sunlight on an overcast day .",
    "this is similar to the penetrative advantage that interstellar photons ( bathing the disk isotropically ) would have ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however in our models the stellar @xmath0 field is typically orders of magnitude more intense .",
    "once in the realm of the molecular disk , @xmath0 transport will be controlled primarily by dust .",
    "fuv - continuum photons pass unimpeded through the h - layer until they reach the dust irradiation surface . until this point the field only experiences geometric inverse - square law diminution - in contrast to the @xmath0 , which has been additionally processed by the h - layer . in this regime",
    "the @xmath0/fuv - continuum photon density ratio favors the unimpeded fuv - continuum photons .",
    "the fuv - continuum eventually impinges upon the dust irradiation surface , doing so at very small angles ( @xmath98 degrees ) .",
    "the relative inefficacy of scattering by dust grains is exacerbated by accompanying absorption .",
    "it is straightforward to show with 1d planar radiative transfer models that the energy density transmitted downwards from this dust irradiation surface is typically of order @xmath99 of that incident upon it @xcite .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0/fuv - continuum photon density ratio undergoes a dramatic reversal in the vicinity of the dust irradiation surface , resulting in a @xmath0-dominated field .",
    "this resurgence appears to more than compensate for the reduction of @xmath0 density due to the h - layer . in the asymptotic limit ( large optical depth ) of the analytic planar model both fields are attenuated according to @xmath100,$]where @xmath101 is the vertical optical depth due to dust , and @xmath102 is a decay constant that depends only on the scattering properties @xmath103 of dust @xcite . as observed , the @xmath0/fuv - continuum ratio approaches a constant value deep inside the disk ( the ` attenuated region ' in figure [ fig : ratios ] ) . at this point both @xmath0 and fuv - continuum fields",
    "are largely isotropized and their transport controlled by dust alone . in effect , the contrasting early life - histories are imprinted into boundary conditions that determine the proportionality coefficients in the asymptotic regime .",
    "a simplified diagrammatical representation of the transport routes is shown in figure [ fig : nh_map ] .    as mentioned previously , the dalessio disks to not include separate thermodynamic treatments for gas and dust . in effect",
    "they assume that the two components are thermally coupled .",
    "models show that this coupling breaks down at low densities , causing the gas temperature to rise above that of dust @xcite .",
    "in turn this increases the local scale height of the gas while decreasing its density .",
    "although not explored in this paper , the thermal decoupling will most likely increase the extent of atomic h in the upper layers of the disk .",
    "this is due to two factors ; first , the formation rate of h@xmath7 is density dependent and an increase in the disk scaleheight will be accompanied by a decrease in volumetric density .",
    "second , h@xmath7 formation on grains becomes increasingly inefficient at @xmath104 due to the short time that h atoms spend on grain surfaces before thermally escaping @xcite .",
    "the settling of dust affects the @xmath0 and fuv - continuum fields in two distinct ways .",
    "first , the removal of dust decreases the efficacy of the @xmath5 formation process , resulting in a thicker h - layer ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : h2 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : columns ] ) .",
    "this ensures that the h - layer processes every stellar @xmath0 incident upon it .",
    "second , the irradiation surface for fuv - continuum photons recedes into the disk as @xmath19 decreases .",
    "the disk becomes flatter and intercepts a smaller fraction of stellar fuv - continuum photons .",
    "a self - consistent disk model that couples disk structure with our new radiative transfer results is required in order to quantify these effects more precisely .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary of the main results :    1 .",
    "the vertical profile of the @xmath0/fuv - continuum photon density ratio is strongly stratified , and may vary by orders of magnitude relative to the intrinsic stellar ratio .",
    "the stratification is strongest in the inner disk .",
    "2 .   the radiation field in the vicinity of the disk midplane - where most of the disk mass resides - is relatively enhanced in @xmath0 .",
    "this enhancement is in addition to that already present in the stellar spectrum .",
    "if previous radiative transfer calculations most closely resemble our fuv - continuum results , then the omission of resonantly scattered @xmath0 implies that the mass - averaged intradisk fuv field has been systematically underestimated .",
    "this directly affects estimates of photoelectric heating rates , thermal balance , and the resulting hydrostatic structure .",
    "the settling of dust ( @xmath105 ) lowers the dust irradiation surface and thickens the resonant scattering h - layer by inhibiting @xmath5 formation .",
    "both effects contribute to a more stratified @xmath0/fuv - continuum ratio , ultimately resulting in a greater @xmath0 enhancement in the molecular disk .",
    "the presence of an optically thick , high - albedo h - layer implies that the direct observation of @xmath0 scattered by the disk ( @xmath106 of incident photons ) may be possible in sufficiently close , low extinction systems ( e.g. tw hya ) .",
    "these observations may place constraints on the shape and thickness of the h - layer .",
    "a @xmath0-dominated radiation field drives differential photo - chemical processes in both the gas and grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "numerous pairs of closely - related molecules exhibit a similar differential response to the spectral form of the uv field @xcite . in view of the strongly stratified @xmath0/fuv - continuum ratio one might also expect the photochemical environment to be similarly stratified .",

    "markov chain monte carlo simulation is an intuitive and versatile technique for numerically solving high - dimensional , geometrically complex transport problems .",
    "although the method permits many degrees of abstraction , the most intuitive implementation simply involves following the stochastic life - histories of many discrete particles ( in our case , photons or photon packets ) as they travel through a medium , experiencing interactions that are modeled probabilistically @xcite .",
    "if we consider the basic problem of photons being absorbed and scattered then it is primarily the inclusion of scattering that complicates the calculation , and thus motivates the use of the monte carlo method .",
    "additionally , the monte carlo method places essentially no constraints on the geometry involved , provided a meaningful spatial discretization can be obtained .",

    "the star is an isotropic light source with total luminosity of @xmath117 .",
    "2 .   randomly sampling beer s law generates the optical depth to the next scattering event , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a uniformly distributed random number in the range @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "the photon trajectory is propagated through the medium until it has traversed an optical distance @xmath121 , where the opacity @xmath122 for fuv - continuum photons and @xmath123 for @xmath0 photons .",
    "the photon is transported from cell - face to cell - face ( see appendix [ sec : intercept ] ) , each time traversing some distance @xmath124 and optical distance @xmath125 , until the scattering location is overstepped , at which point the photon is regressed back to the exact scattering location .",
    "the optical properties within a cell are considered to be homogeneous .",
    "although the photon is traveling in 3d space , at each face - intercept its coordinates and direction vector are rotated back into the @xmath38 plane .",
    "relevant information ( e.g. packet luminosity @xmath126 ) is deposited as the photon passes through each cell .",
    "there is a continual attrition of photons due to absorption , causing a decrease in the weight - factor @xmath127 w_i$ ] , where @xmath46 is the albedo .",
    "the scattered photon direction is found by performing these steps ; transforming into a frame aligned with the photon direction vector , finding the scattering angle by randomly sampling the scattering phase function , and finally transforming back into the coordinate frame of the disk .",
    "this coordinate transformation is an application of euler angles . in the case of @xmath0 , the type of scattering",
    "must first be resolved .",
    "if a uniformly distributed random variate @xmath128 $ ] satisfies @xmath129 , then we execute resonant scattering , otherwise the scattering is by dust .",
    "repeat from step 2 until photon leaves domain .",
    "the henyey - greenstein phase function used for dust scattering has a number of convenient features that make it attractive for use in monte carlo simulations .",
    "not only can its probability distribution ( eqn [ eq : hg ] ) be integrated over angle to produce a closed - form cumulative probability distribution , but the result can be algebraically inverted , permitting the expression of the scattering angle , @xmath130 , in terms of a uniformly distributed random number , @xmath128 $ ] ,    @xmath131.\\label{eq : hginv}\\ ] ]    we approximate @xmath0 scattering as isotropic .",
    "this simplifies matters considerably , since the new scattered direction @xmath132 is simply the result of randomly sampling directions over the unit sphere , thus avoiding the computationally expensive euler angle calculation .",
    "we restrict our computational domain to @xmath133 i.e. the volume above the disk midplane .",
    "this is equivalent to asserting a mirror plane at @xmath134 ; if any photons reach the disk midplane they are reflected @xmath135 .",
    "the solution is now smooth and symmetric about the disk midplane , properly accounting for photons that pass vertically from one side of the disk to the other .",
    "when projected onto the @xmath38 plane , straight lines typically appear as hyperbolae .",
    "photons may escape by reaching the outer and upper edges of the domain .",
    "in fact , the delaunay tessellation produces a convex domain perimeter , which in general is not restricted to a rectangular form ..",
    "although the unstructured grid is specified in 2d , we still need to envision the cells as 3d entities in order to use them in the monte carlo radiative transfer simulation .",
    "this is because a photon travels in 3d ( it is not constrained to a single @xmath38 plane ) . by employing an axisymmetric cylindrical framework we are asserting invariance upon rotation about the @xmath136 axis .",
    "once rotated , the triangular simplex is extruded into a torus with a triangular cross - section .",
    "photon trajectories will be propagated through these volumes , requiring geometric tools that allow us to keep track of the intercepts between the photon path and the surfaces of these contiguous volumes .",
    "figure [ fig : cell ] shows how the triangular torus is formed from the interstice of three intersecting cones .",
    "computationally , the most efficient way to transport photons through these volumes is to jump from one cell face ( the entry face ) to another ( the exit face ) . in order to determine these locations we need to calculate the intersections between a straight line ( photon trajectory ) and the three cones that form the surfaces of our toroidal cells ( in 3d ) .",
    "the exit face is always the face with the intersection point that is closest to the current position of the photon ( in the direction of photon propagation ) .        which simply states that the vector between a location in space @xmath138 and the cone vertex @xmath139 , makes an angle @xmath140 with the cone axis ( in our case the z - axis , with unit direction vector @xmath141 ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath140 as the opening angle .",
    "it is convenient to square eqn .",
    "[ eq : cone ] to obtain a quadratic version of the cone equation .",
    "there will now be two solutions , one of which corresponds to the reflection cone .",
    "for example , if @xmath138 lies on the cone , then so too does the point @xmath142 that simply corresponds to the reflection of @xmath138 through the vertex @xmath139 .",
    "this formulation automatically deals with cones that are ` upside down ' ( i.e. have opening angle @xmath143 ) . thus , the formulation is comprehensive and it only remains to select the solution corresponding to the appropriate cone orientation .",
    "we proceed by writing the squared eqn [ eq : cone ] in matrix form ,          where @xmath148 is the unit direction vector , @xmath149 is a point of origin ( the current photon location ) , and @xmath150 the distance along the trajectory .",
    "the intersection between the photon trajectory and cell wall is found by inserting eqn [ eq : line ] into eqn [ eq : matrix ] and solving for the distance @xmath150 . upon doing this",
    "we obtain the quadratic equation ,      where @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "the most case is that @xmath155 , making eqn [ eq : quad ] a quadratic equation with solutions @xmath156 . if @xmath157 no real solutions are possible and no intersection exists",
    ". if @xmath158 a single ( repeated root ) intercept is found , which is seen to be tangent to the cone at the point @xmath159 . if @xmath160 two intercepts exist at @xmath161 .",
    "there are additional possible situations , for example , @xmath162 renders eqn [ eq : quad ] linear , implying that only one intersection exists . in this rather improbable case",
    "the photon trajectory is parallel ( but not coincident ) with a straight line on the cone . finally , if @xmath163 the photon path lies on the cone surface , which is exceedingly unlikely .",
    "a computational implementation should takes these cases into account .",
    "there are extremal cones that may arise from the tessellation and need to be taken into consideration .",
