    "one of the characteristic features of many glasses and amorphous materials is the onset@xcite of low - frequency collective modes ( boson peak ) in the energy range @xmath1  mev at low @xmath2 , where the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) @xmath3 shows an excess over @xmath4 predicted by the debye model .",
    "disordered materials are further known to exhibit many anomalous behaviors compared to their crystalline counterparts , such as the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity@xcite and specific heat@xcite at low temperatures .",
    "many scenarios@xcite have been suggested to explain the physical mechanisms behind the boson peak and related anomalies , but a comprehensive understanding has proved elusive .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments on water confined in nanopores indicate the presence of a boson peak@xcite around @xmath5  mev ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) emerging below 230k in the incoherent dynamic structure factor .",
    "these results were tentatively interpreted as arising from a gradual change in the local structure of confined liquid water when crossing the widom line temperature @xmath0@xcite .",
    "earlier , neutron scattering has also been applied to protein hydration water  @xcite and a boson peak was found around 30  @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath0 corresponds to the loci of maxima of thermodynamic response functions in the one - phase region beyond the liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) proposed to exist in supercooled liquid water@xcite .",
    "a widom line in the supercritical region in argon has recently been studied@xcite and found to be directly related to a dynamical crossover between liquid - like and gas - like properties , but the existence of a dynamical crossover in supercooled water is subject to some controversy  @xcite .",
    "since the melting temperature is strongly depressed in nanoconfinement and in protein hydration water , deeply supercooled confined water has been used experimentally to infer the behavior of bulk water , which is more challenging to supercool .",
    "however , the similarity to bulk water has been called into question@xcite , and it is thus important to further investigate the relationship between water in these different forms .    both experimental@xcite and simulation@xcite studies suggest that the density relaxation of confined and hydration water at and slightly below the widom temperature is of the order of a few tens of nanoseconds , implying that liquid water is still in metastable equilibrium over the experimental time scales involved@xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of a boson peak below @xmath0 in confined water thus suggests that the low - density - like liquid shares vibrational properties with the glassy state , as has been observed previously for other systems such as @xmath8@xcite . on the other hand , the dynamic structure factor of crystalline",
    "ice exhibits a peak at a slightly higher frequency around @xmath9  @xmath7@xcite as do the raman spectra of ice ih and proton - ordered ice xi@xcite ; in the latter case the peak becomes extremely sharp .",
    "these results indicate a connection between the dynamics of supercooled liquid and crystalline vibrational dynamics . indeed , it has recently been suggested that boson peaks observed in glasses are related to the vibrational dynamics of the parent crystal@xcite .    to shed light on the question of whether bulk supercooled liquid water displays a boson peak , we study the low - frequency dynamics of the tip4p/2005 model of water which accurately reproduces a range of water properties  @xcite , including its anomalies  @xcite .",
    "this model has been found to exhibit a llcp in the vicinity of @xmath10  bar and @xmath11  k@xcite .",
    "the associated widom line has been shown to be accompanied by a structural crossover from a predominantly high - density liquid ( hdl ) structure to a predominantly low - density liquid ( ldl ) structure@xcite occurring at a temperature @xmath0 around @xmath12  k at 1  bar .",
    "we find that this water model indeed displays a boson peak in the bulk supercooled regime and that its onset coincides with the widom temperature .",
    "our analysis further shows that it derives from transverse acoustic modes in the parent crystal , ice ih , in agreement with the recently proposed picture@xcite .",
    "we further verify our results using another model of water , tip5p , and find also in this case an emergence of a boson peak below the widom line .",

    "since low - frequency dynamics in supercooled liquids and glasses may be affected by finite - size effects  @xcite , we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) and [ fig : fig1](d ) a comparison with a much larger system , @xmath35 at 210  k. in @xmath22 the oscillations are shifted to longer times while the minimum at @xmath36  ps and subsequent peak around @xmath37  ps are system - size independent .",
    "the sharp peaks in @xmath13 vanish in the large simulation but the broad peak around @xmath33  @xmath7 persists ; we therefore label this peak of low - frequency excitations as the boson peak . comparing our simulation results with experimental neutron data on protein hydration water@xcite and on water in confinement@xcite reveals",
    "rather good agreement . both the experimental energy position ,  @xmath38  @xmath7 for hydration water@xcite and @xmath39  @xmath7 for confined water@xcite , and the temperature onset , @xmath40  k@xcite",
    ", are surprisingly well reproduced by the tip4p/2005 model considering the approximate nature of classical force fields .",
    "since we observe well - defined low - frequency modes in the incoherent dsf in the simulations of bulk water , we conclude that the boson peak in supercooled water is not a consequence of confinement and that it would likely be detected also in experiments on bulk water , if sufficient supercooling could be achieved .",
    "a connection to the widom line in tip4p/2005 is clearly present since a qualitative change of both @xmath22 and @xmath13 takes place between 230 and 240  k. our results thus imply that a boson peak may also appear in other tetrahedral  @xcite liquids , such as silicon and silica , for which simulations have indicated the existence of a liquid - liquid phase transition@xcite . to confirm the connection between the boson peak and the widom line we have performed additional simulations of a different water potential , the tip5p model@xcite , which has been shown to exhibit a widom line around 250  k@xcite , 20  k above that for tip4p/2005 . as shown in the supplementary information , a boson peak emerges also in this model and , indeed , it coincides with @xmath0 at 250  k.      the boson peak is commonly discussed in terms of the vdos , @xmath3 .",
    "a distinct peak is often not seen in the vdos itself but appears only in the reduced vdos after normalizing by the squared frequency , @xmath41 , which reveals the excess over the debye model prediction @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] . by simulating a range of different system sizes",
    "we can establish the system - size dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "the agreement for frequencies @xmath48  @xmath7 is very good for different system sizes l , but the sharp low - frequency peaks shift to lower frequencies as the system size is increased .",
    "indeed , both peaks extrapolate linearly to zero as @xmath49 , as seen in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](a ) , suggesting that they disappear in the limit of infinite system size .    as discussed in relation to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , there is a low - frequency peak in @xmath13 for hexagonal ice at somewhat higher frequency compared to the supercooled liquid simulations , suggesting a link between the liquid and crystalline low - frequency modes .",
    "we investigate this by performing thermally non - equilibrated simulations at even lower temperatures where the tip4p/2005 model vitrifies to a low - density amorphous ( lda)-like solid .",
    "the non - equilibrium simulations are performed by annealing the equilibrated metastable 210  k simulation with a cooling rate of 2@xmath5010@xmath51  k / s to reach target temperatures of 150 and 100  k. figure  [ fig : fig2](b ) shows the reduced vdos , @xmath52/\\omega^2 $ ] for simulations at 100 , 150 and 210  k compared to the hexagonal ice simulation at 100  k. we subtract an extrapolated value of @xmath53 from @xmath3 to eliminate uncertainties due to the finite length of the trajectories when evaluating the fourier transform in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdos ] ) . a clear shift to higher frequencies of the boson peak is observed as the supercooled liquid simulations are cooled into the lda glass region , and the reduced vdos at 100  k resembles the crystalline ice counterpart .    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , we show the reduced vdos @xmath54 obtained from the normal modes of the liquid calculated from quenched configurations ( _ i.e. _ , energy minimized inherent structures ) at @xmath55  k. we find that the boson peak in @xmath54 is blue - shifted to around @xmath9  @xmath7 , close to the peak for hexagonal ice , compared to the velocity autocorrelation function vdos which peaks at @xmath33  @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests that a key difference in low - frequency vibrational properties between the ldl - like liquid below the widom line and crystalline ice lies in the more anharmonic dynamics of the liquid phase .",
    "having established the existence of a boson peak in supercooled water below the widom line and its connection to low - frequency dynamics present in the parent crystal , ice ih , we now turn to the study of transverse and longitudinal current correlations to clarify the nature of these low - frequency modes .",

    "the frequency decomposition of the longitudinal and transverse current autocorrelation functions is @xmath61 where @xmath62  or @xmath2 .    in the bottom part of fig .",

    "we see that the first sharp size - dependent low - frequency peak in vdos , which develops below @xmath0 , coincides exactly with the lowest-@xmath64 tccf , and the second finite - size peak around @xmath32  @xmath7 coincides with the second - lowest-@xmath64 tccf ( not shown ) .",
    "returning to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) , the low - frequency side of the boson peak is smoother in the large @xmath35 simulations and the sharp peaks related to the lowest-@xmath64 transverse currents are instead seen at frequencies below 10  @xmath7 . we thus conclude that the sharp system size dependent low - frequency peaks around the boson peak frequency and below are predominantly transverse excitations , consistent with previous findings for amorphous silica  @xcite .",

    "@xmath63 develops a peak at @xmath71  @xmath7 , the same excitation as in the longitudinal current spectra .",
    "transverse and longitudinal modes are thus strongly mixed above 0.5  @xmath26 as has been found previously also for the spc / e water model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mixing happens at both high frequencies ( @xmath71  @xmath7 ) and low frequencies ( @xmath72  @xmath7 ) as evident from transverse excitations appearing in longitudinal spectra .",
    "we note that the band at @xmath73  @xmath7 in liquid water is associated with four - coordinated water molecules since low - frequency raman spectra of water down to @xmath74  c showed its intensity to increase with decreasing temperature@xcite and hexagonal ice also displays a strong band near this frequency  @xcite .",
    "hence , the emergence of the @xmath73  @xmath7 band in both @xmath67 and @xmath63 suggests that liquid water at this temperature exhibits networks of four - coordinated molecules over length scales as large as @xmath75  @xmath76   .",

    "we compare cumulatively integrated spectra over @xmath64 for different frequencies for both the transverse and longitudinal parts , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , defined as @xmath79 where @xmath62  or @xmath2 and @xmath80 is the smallest wave number accessible in our system of box size @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath81 thus describes the total contribution of longitudinal and transverse modes with different wave numbers up to @xmath64 for a given frequency @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a)-(b ) we show @xmath83 and @xmath84 for several frequencies @xmath85 in the boson peak region around 37  @xmath7 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that transverse modes are dominant in the boson peak frequency regime for @xmath69  @xmath26 .",
    "a number of studies on amorphous materials have found that the modes in the boson peak frequency range are localized or quasi - localized@xcite . in order to investigate whether this holds also for tip4p/2005 water below the widom line @xmath0 we calculate the degree of localization by performing a normal mode analysis of quenched ( or inherent ) structures , obtained by energy - minimizing snapshots from simulation trajectories .",
    "a measure of the degree of localization of a vibrational mode is the frequency - dependent participation ratio@xcite @xmath86 for mode @xmath87 @xmath88^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the contribution of all degrees of freedom of molecule @xmath90 to the normal mode @xmath87 .",
    "the participation ratio is unity when all molecules contribute equally to the normal mode in consideration , while @xmath91 if only one molecule contributes to the total energy of the mode . hence , for an extended mode @xmath92 is quite large and does not depend on the system size while for a localized mode it is small and scales with system size as @xmath93 .",
    "one way to determine the extent of localization is thus to inspect the system - size dependence of the participation ratio .",
    "we find ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7](a ) ) that the participation ratio is quite large , around @xmath94 , for the modes with frequency below @xmath9  @xmath7 , the region of the boson peak .",
    "apart from the sharp finite - size peaks , the participation ratio for the modes in the region of the boson peak show only a weak system size dependence , suggesting that the modes giving rise to the boson peak are not localized but extended .",
    "we next introduce a function @xmath95 defined as the maximum displacement of molecules at a distance @xmath96 from the molecule with the largest displacement in the normal mode . for a localized mode a rapid decay of @xmath95",
    "should be seen . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](b ) we show average @xmath95 for the normal modes in two different frequency regimes  for the boson peak regime ( @xmath97  @xmath7 , note that the frequency of the boson peak for the quenched configuration is shifted to higher frequency compared to the boson peak frequency @xmath98  @xmath7 of the liquid at @xmath55  k , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) , and in comparison we also show average @xmath95 for modes in the range of @xmath99  @xmath100 , which is a range of localized vibrations .",
    "while for @xmath101  @xmath7 , @xmath95 decays rapidly to zero , for the boson peak region it does not , suggesting again an extended nature of the boson peak modes .",
    "the low - frequency vibrations of a classical potential model of water , tip4p/2005 , are investigated in the supercooled temperature regime to clarify the origin of the boson peak reported from inelastic neutron scattering experiments below around 225  k in nano - confined@xcite and protein - hydration water@xcite .",
    "we find that sharp low - frequency peaks emerge in the incoherent dynamic structure factor and the reduced density of states of the simulated liquid water as the system is cooled below the widom line , but a system - size investigation reveals that in the limit of an infinitely large simulation box these peaks extrapolate to zero frequency .",
    "the sharp finite - size peaks are seen to coincide exactly with the inherently discrete , low wave - number acoustic branch of the transverse current correlation functions , reflecting a strong contribution of transverse modes in this frequency region . however , we find a broad boson peak centered around @xmath33  @xmath7 which is unaffected by system size , and for which the frequency region and temperature onset in the incoherent dsf agree well with neutron experiments on confined water .",
    "due to its lower melting temperature , water in confinement has been used experimentally to infer the behavior of bulk water below the bulk homogeneous nucleation temperature .",
    "the validity of this comparison has been questioned , but the good agreement observed here in the low - frequency vibrational dynamics lends support to the view of confinement as useful in the study of supercooled bulk water , at least for low - frequency vibrational properties .    the frequency of the boson peak in supercooled tip4p/2005 water as observed in the reduced vdos changes as the simulation is annealed into the lda glass region and approaches @xmath102  @xmath7 .",
    "this is also the frequency at which hexagonal ice simulations display a peak in vibrational spectra deriving from the transverse acoustic branch , as has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "thus , upon lowering the temperature below the widom line , the low - frequency dynamics of the system progressively changes from ldl - like to lda glass and to the dynamics found in hexagonal ice . a similar shift to higher frequencies",
    "is observed in normal - mode spectra of inherent structures quenched from liquid at temperatures below the widom line , indicating that the lower frequency of the boson peak in the liquid below the widom line , compared to the transverse acoustic peak in the ice , is a result of the more anharmonic nature of the vibrational modes in the liquid",
    ".    recent work by chumakov _",
    "et al._@xcite on glasses suggests that there is no excess in the actual number of states at the boson peak and hence no additional modes compared to the crystal .",
    "the boson peak is thus related to the transverse acoustic singularity of the underlying crystal structure .",
    "transverse modes have also been firmly connected to the boson peak in other works  @xcite .",
    "indeed , our studies of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions suggest that low - frequency transverse phonons contribute the most to the boson peak intensity in the range of wave numbers where both the longitudinal and transverse phonons show a solid - like response over large length scales , namely emergence of a high - frequency peak in both longitudinal and transverse spectra at @xmath103  @xmath7 for @xmath69  @xmath26 .",
    "the appearance of this high - frequency excitation associated with four - coordinated molecules in longitudinal and transverse spectra coincides with a pile up of intensities in the boson peak regime .    to conclude , our results indicate that liquid water displays a boson peak below the widom line temperature @xmath0 .",
    "both the onset temperature and energy position are similar to what has been observed experimentally for confined water  @xcite .",
    "we find that as the liquid crosses over to a low - density - like liquid structure below @xmath0 the low - frequency dynamics of the liquid changes to resemble that of the underlying crystal , ice ih .",
    "the boson peak in supercooled water is thus a manifestation of the transverse acoustic singularity of the crystal and may therefore be a general phenomenon in tetrahedral liquids showing a liquid - liquid phase transition .",
    "we simulate tip4p/2005@xcite water for a range of temperatures at atmospheric pressure .",
    "equilibration is first performed in the npt ensemble , using the nos - hoover thermostat and parrinello - rahman barostat to attain constant temperature and pressure .",
    "the equilibrated densities are then used in equilibration nvt runs performed over multiple structural relaxation times , after which we switch to the nve ensemble to compute the relevant dynamical quantities .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated with a time step of 0.2 - 1.0  fs , depending on the observed energy conservation .",
    "most simulations are performed using @xmath16=512 molecules , but to quantify the finite - size effects we simulate larger systems up to @xmath16=45,000 .",
    "simulation temperatures between 210 and 260  k at @xmath68  atm were chosen so that the system crosses @xmath0 , the temperature where maxima in response functions are observed . to confirm the connection between the widom line @xmath0 and the onset temperature of the boson peak we repeat the above simulation protocol for the tip5p water model@xcite at temperatures between 240 and 270  k ( see supplementary information ) .",

    "<S> the frequency and onset temperature of the boson peak in our simulations of bulk water agree well with the results from experiments on nanoconfined water . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the boson peak in water is not an exclusive effect of confinement . </S>",
