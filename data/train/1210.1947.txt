    "<S> it is shown through analytical modeling and numerical simulations that external magnetic fields can relax the self - trapping thresholds in plasma based accelerators . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transverse location where self - trapping occurs can be selected by adequate choice of the spatial profile of the external magnetic field . </S>",
