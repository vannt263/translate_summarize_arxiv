    "thus , the distribution of excesses can be compared with traditional two - sample tests , which show that swps and swops do not differ .",
    "this is due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of stars exhibit pure photospheric emission at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the 70@xmath0 m data set is censored  there are upper limits  and survival analysis is required to compare the two distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the kaplan - meier ( km ) estimator gives the cumulative distribution of a statistical variable taking into account the upper limits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to use survival analysis , the censoring should not depend on the variable itself .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled by using the observed - to - photospheric flux ratio ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) as the variable . in average swps are farther than swops . as a consequence ,",
    "the former tend to be apparently fainter than the latter , resulting in more non - detections in the swps sample , introducing malmquist bias .",

    "1.2 package @xcite , which implements the methods presented in @xcite . as with the two - sample tests ,",
    "the km estimators show that at 24@xmath0 m there is no difference between the distribution of excesses of swps and of swops . at 70@xmath0 m",
    ", however , the two km curves are marginally different .",
    "the largest distance between the curves occurs at @xmath12=1.5 .",
    "the values at this point are 0.273@xmath330.045 and 0.155@xmath330.034 for swps and swops , respectively , a 2.1@xmath28 difference .",
    "thus , swps tend to have excesses slightly more often than swops .",
    "other statistical tests also suggest that the distributions are marginally different .",
    "for example , gehan s generalized wilcoxon test indicates that the probability of the null hypothesis  that swps and swops have the same incidence of debris disks ",
    "other tests give probabilities between 20% and 40% . to increase",
    "the significance of the obtained 2.1@xmath28 difference to 5@xmath28 would require about five times more objects in each sample .",
    "the mean excess at 70@xmath0 m , as given by the area under the km estimator curves is 2.975@xmath330.732 for swps , and 1.725@xmath330.273 for swops .",
    "though disks around swps tend to be brighter , the difference is only 1.6@xmath28 .",
    "the results do not change significantly if we discard the four giant stars from the swps sample .",
    "the common way in the literature to calculate detection rates is to divide the number of stars with excess by the number of all observed stars ( tab .",
    "[ tab : detection ] ) . at 70@xmath0 m",
    "this method gives a detection rate of 15% for both swps and swops .",
    "however , if we were to divide by the number of detected sources only , we would conclude that 37% of the swps have excesses , compared to 18% of the swop sample .",

    "we found that metallicity does not correlate with the infrared excess in either sample , confirming results obtained for smaller samples @xcite .",
    "while metallicity is one of the strongest predictors for the presence of giant planets @xcite , it does not predict the presence of debris disks .",
    "@xcite argued that the larger metallicity of swps implies that more planetesimals were formed early in those systems but that most were expelled due to the orbital evolution of the giant planets .",
    "the planetesimal configuration is then the same that would occur in an average metallicity swops .",
    "this implies that debris disks are more common around metal - rich stars without planets , which is in contrast to the observations presented here .    around a 1l@xmath35 solar - type star ,",
    "a narrow ring of dust particles radiating as blackbodies would have the peak of its emission ( f@xmath36 ) at 24@xmath0 m if located at 1.7au from the star .",
    "the gravitational influence of giant planets extends at most to the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for our sample , where the average semi - major axis is 1.4au , this would be 2.9au .",
    "thus , these planets might stir the planetesimals located within a belt similar to the asteroid belt in our solar system .",
    "however , our results show that 24@xmath0 m excess is rare in both swps and swops .",
    "moreover , not all stars exhibiting 24@xmath0 m excess have dust within this region : the warmest dust present in these systems is 60k dust at a radius of 25au for hd10647 @xcite , 120k dust at 3au for hd22049 @xcite , 245k dust at 1au for hd69830 @xcite , and 87k dust at 9.1au for hd166 @xcite .",
    "this implies that warm debris dust is intrinsically rare in both swps and swops , thus the physical reason of this rarity is probably unrelated to the planets .",
    "with so few stars with 24@xmath0 m excess , the km estimators can not rule out any difference between the swps and the swops samples .",
    "our observations do not preclude that there are differences between the two samples in the distribution of asteroid belt - type debris disks fainter than our detection limit at 24@xmath0 m ( l@xmath37 / l@xmath38 @xmath39 10@xmath40 , as calculated from eqn .",

    "debris dust peaking at 70@xmath0 m is usually too far from the planets considered here to be affected by their presence .",
    "dust distances for debris disk systems with excesses at 70@xmath0 m are mostly larger than 4 - 5au @xcite .",
    "the null hypothesis is consistent with that measurement .",
    "@xcite argued that stars with planets are typically farther and in more confused regions of the sky , and suggest that dust around them may be more common than what detections indicate . in our sample , the median distance to the swps is 35 pc , compared to the 15 pc for the swops , and two - sample tests reveal these distances to be significantly different .",
    "however , our main analysis quantity is the distance - independent @xmath41 , and we explicitly include information about sky confusion noise in the form of upper limits , which are taken into account in the survival analysis",
    ". therefore , our results do not support the presence of a large population of undiscovered debris disks around swps .    at 70@xmath0 m , our detection limit ( eqn .",
    "11 of @xcite ) is l@xmath42 / l@xmath38 @xmath39 10@xmath43 . for these bright debris disks ,",
    "the null hypothesis implies that the population of planets at distances where the 70@xmath0 m emission comes from is the same for swps and the swops .",
    "the marginally higher incidence of debris disks around swps suggests that in these systems an outer planet might also exist , which stirs up the planetesimals producing a cold debris disk .",
    "the model by @xcite for a - type stars suggests that the 70@xmath0 m emission should be larger for swps than for swops , due to the larger mass of the protoplanetary disk in the former .",
    "they speculate that a similar trend holds for sun - like stars .",
    "we found that the brightest debris disks in our swps sample are 2@xmath343 times brighter than those in the swops sample , but the mean brightnesses are only slightly higher in the swps sample at a 1.6@xmath28 level .",
    "our results do not contradict with the prediction of @xcite , although the difference we found is less pronounced than that expected for a - type stars .",
    "note that disk mass is not the only variable that controls the likelihood of planet formation : disk lifetime , metallicity , and surface density distribution are also important .",
    "prior to this study , only a dozen stars were known to harbour both planets and debris disks .",
    "our 10 new debris disks found around planet - bearing stars at 70@xmath0 m doubled this number .",
    "we analyze a sample of planet - host stars at least three times larger than any previous studies and a carefully chosen control sample of stars without planets that is comparable in size .",
    "we have found that the incidence of debris disks ( measured at 70@xmath0 m ) is only marginally higher among stars with planets , than among those without .",
    "this result suggests the possibility that  if debris production is primarily due to stirring by planets  the planet population at large radii ( larger than what current radial velocity surveys can find ) is comparable in both samples ( although there are other possibilities for debris production , such as planetesimal self - stirring , or external perturbations ) .",
    "we found that the brightness of the average debris disk is not significantly different in the two samples .",

    "<S> dust in debris disks is generated by collisions among planetesimals . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these planetesimals is a consequence of the planet formation process , but the relationship between debris disks and planets has not been clearly established . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze spitzer / mips 24 and 70@xmath0 m data for 150 planet - bearing stars , and compare the incidence of debris disks around these stars with a sample of 118 stars around which planets have been searched for , but not found . </S>",
    "<S> together they comprise the largest sample ever assembled to deal with this question . </S>",
    "<S> the use of survival analysis techniques allows us to account for the large number of non - detections at 70@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered 10 new debris disks around stars with planets and one around a star without known planets . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the incidence of debris disks is marginally higher among stars with planets , than among those without , and that the brightness of the average debris disk is not significantly different in the two samples . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the presence of a planet that has been detected via current radial velocity techniques is not a good predictor of the presence of a debris disk detected at infrared wavelengths . </S>"
