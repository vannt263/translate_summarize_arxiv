    "charmless hadronic two - body @xmath1 decays are a rich source of flavour physics information and are particularly well suited to the study of @xmath2 violation .",
    "the theoretical description of these decays is hampered by the need to separate the long distance physics of hadronization from the short distance electroweak physics of interest .",
    "qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite is a theoretical framework suitable for the study of these decays . at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath3",
    ", it allows for a clean separation of scales ; the long distance physics is parametrized in terms of form factors and decay constants which can be related to other processes , while the short distance physics , including strong phases , is perturbatively calculable .",
    "the effective field theory formalism necessary to go beyond lo in @xmath3 is the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) developed by bauer , fleming , pirjol and stewart .",
    "@xcite    qcdf was supplemented by an effective field theory description , scet , giving further credibility to the factorization result first put forward in the context of qcdf . a modern view of qcdf , that we adopt in this short review on the status of qcdf",
    ", would be that qcdf is the application of scet to two - body b decays .",
    "we therefore use the terms qcdf and scet interchangeably throughout the review . in the application of the theory ,",
    "two approaches exist : the original approach of beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda ( bbns ) , often called qcd factorization ( qcdf ) and the approach advocated by bauer , pirjol , rothstein and stewart ( bprs ) often referred to as scet .",
    "although this article will make reference to both approaches , emphasis will be placed on that of bbns .",
    "the discussion reflecting recent results from the bprs perspective has been covered at this conference by christian bauer in his presentation on scet .    in the next section",
    "we give a basic description of charmless two - body hadronic @xmath1 decays in the qcd factorization formalism and describe the differences which exist between the bbns and bprs approaches . in section [ bvv ] ,",
    "we discuss a recent application of qcd factorization to @xmath0 decays . in section [ nlo ]",
    ", we discuss the theoretical situation at nlo , including both @xmath3 and @xmath4 corrections , some recent work towards the nlo perturbative corrections and what work remains to be done .",
    "at lo in @xmath3 , the amplitude for @xmath5 decay factorizes , @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hard scattering kernels that depend on the specific process being considered , but are perturbatively calculable in an expansion in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the intermediate scale @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are light and heavy decay constants , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcda ) .",
    "they are universal and do not depend on the decay process .",
    "they are determined from qcd sum rules , lattice qcd , or experiment .",
    "although this formula is valid only at lo in @xmath3 , it is valid to all orders in @xmath4 .",
    "a systematic treatment of the higher order corrections can be given using scet .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , there are two main approaches which we refer to as bbns @xcite and bprs @xcite .",
    "below , we outline several of the important differences , which have been discussed at great length in @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important difference between the two approaches is the treatment of the so - called charming penguin contributions ( see fig .",
    "bprs argue that since @xmath17 , there are configurations with almost on - shell charm quarks leading to long distance effects . as a result , they parametrize the penguins and fit them from data .    a typical charming penguin contribution ]    bbns maintains that charming penguin diagrams factorize in the formal @xmath3 limit and should not be given special treatment .    in the bbns approach a subset of higher order @xmath3 corrections",
    "are typically included that are deemed to be numerically large .",
    "this is in contrast to bprs , where calculations are consistently performed to a fixed order in the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "it has been the philosophy of bbns that the inputs used to make predictions for @xmath5 decays do not come from these decays themselves ; rather , the form factors and decay constants enter from other observables , lattice calculations , or some other external source .",
    "bprs on the other hand impose no such restriction and use not only external sources but also the @xmath18 decays themselves as inputs . in particular , bprs has up to this point chosen to fit the scet form factor , @xmath19 ( see below ) , rather than perturbatively expanding it and relating it to other observables .",
    "bbns and bprs also differ in the counting of the soft overlap and hard scattering terms in ( [ loeqn ] ) . in both cases these terms",
    "are counted as leading order in @xmath3 , but bbns assumes that soft overlap is dominated by soft contributions without @xmath10 suppression , and is thus assumed to be larger .",
    "the differences given above leave the bbns approach more predictive than bprs , but at the cost of being less conservative .",
    "we will see that when nlo corrections are taken into account , some of these differences will disappear .",
    "qcdf had been used to predict the branching ratios and @xmath2 asymmetries of a large number of two - body charmless @xmath20 and @xmath21 decay modes @xcite . in a recent work , beneke , rohrer and yang @xcite",
    "have examined @xmath0 decays in the context of qcd factorization .    according to naive factorization , the ratio of longitudinal , negative and positive helicity @xmath0 decay amplitudes scale as @xcite @xmath22 although this scaling is well obeyed by @xmath23 decays",
    ", it is badly broken by penguin dominated decays such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which have anomalously large transverse polarizations @xcite    beneke , rohrer and yang have identified a novel contribution to @xmath0 decays that had not been previously taken into account .",
    "this contribution , a contribution to the transverse electromagnetic penguin amplitudes , is given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ q7diags ] .",
    "[ 1]new contributions to @xmath0 decay , title=\"fig : \" ]    although this contribution is in fact @xmath26 enhanced over the leading terms , it is also @xmath27 suppressed . as a result , it is the dominant contribution to the transverse helicity modes , but is not large enough to explain the puzzle of the large transverse polarizations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    although insufficient to resolve the discrepancy between theory and experiment , the new contribution has pronounced effects , as demonstrated in the examples below .",
    "these examples make use of the current experimental data to estimate the qcd penguin contributions to the decay amplitudes .",
    "qcd factorization is used to estimate all other contributions , including the electroweak penguin effects .",
    "( several other approximations are also necessary as explained in @xcite . )    as a first example , consider the ratio of @xmath2 averaged helicity decay rates @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the polarization ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 is the electroweak penguin contribution calculated in qcdf and @xmath34 is the qcd penguin contribution whose magnitude is determined from the br and @xmath35 of @xmath36 ( note that @xmath37 ) .",
    "@xmath38 is a small contribution from the color - suppressed tree amplitude ( with some dependence on @xmath33 ) . without the effects of fig .",
    "[ q7diags ] , @xmath39 takes on the value @xmath40 , but is increased to @xmath41 when the new effects are introduced .",
    "also consider the ratio @xmath42 as before , @xmath43 is determined from the br and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "this analysis leads to @xmath44 with the new contribution and @xmath45 without .",
    "here it is possible to compare this result to experiment .",
    "the above ratio of branching ratios is related to the ratio of polarization fractions @xmath46 so long as the @xmath2 asymmetry is assumed to be zero . using theory to estimate this asymmetry leads to the results @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ f'_- & = & 0.4 \\pm 0.1 \\;\\;\\ ; [ 0.8 \\pm 0.1 \\mbox{(without)}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the experimental results for these ratios are @xcite @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". as can be seen , the effects of the new operator can be large ( as is the case for @xmath50 ) and would seem to bring theory further in line with experimental expectations .",
    "in this section , we examine current status and outlook for the nlo corrections to the factorization formalism ( be it scet or qcd factorization ) .",
    "the nlo corrections include both perturbative corrections to the calculable kernels ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , as well as power corrections ( @xmath3 ) to the leading order result eq .",
    "( [ loeqn ] ) .",
    "the primary motivation to include the nlo corrections is simple : to reduce overall uncertainties .",
    "both perturbative and power corrections are expected to be of order @xmath51 .",
    "thus , to reduce theory uncertainties below this level and remain competitive with experiment , it becomes necessary to include both these corrections .",
    "there are also observables for which the nlo corrections are indispensable .",
    "@xmath2 asymmetries will receive large corrections at nlo , if at lo the `` tree '' amplitudes ( for definition see e.g. @xcite ) do not originate from the @xmath52 operators of the effective electroweak hamiltonian . for @xmath53 modes such as @xmath54 or @xmath55",
    "we expect large @xmath56 corrections to their @xmath2 asymmetries .",
    "this situation is even more extreme for @xmath57 modes such as @xmath58 or @xmath59 , where no ckm hierarchy exists between the `` tree '' and `` penguin '' amplitudes .",
    "typical power corrections are of the order @xmath51 , and will likely introduce many new parameters .",
    "scet is the theoretical framework necessary to describe the @xmath3 corrections , but almost no @xmath3 corrections have been considered .",
    "exceptions include the annihilation contributions and chirally enhanced contributions that have been taken into account by bbns .",
    "much work remains to be done for these corrections .    unlike the power corrections above ,",
    "almost all of the order @xmath4 corrections have been calculated . to examine these corrections , it is useful to rewrite the basic qcdf formula ( [ loeqn ] ) , by writing @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hard coefficients , calculable in @xmath63 where perturbation theory is expected to be valid .",
    "the lo contribution to the hard coefficients is in general @xmath56 .",
    "the jet function , @xmath64 , is perturbatively calculable in @xmath10 and differs from the hard coefficients in two important ways : the lo contribution to @xmath64 is @xmath65 and @xmath64 depends on only one of the two final state mesons , and so can be related to other processes . in particular",
    ", the same jet function occurs in semi - leptonic decay . as of the last fpcp conference , fpcp 2004 ,",
    "the hard kernel @xmath7 was known to @xmath66 ( nlo+ ) @xcite , @xmath67 was known to @xmath68 ( lo ) , and @xmath64 was known to @xmath69 ( nlo ) .",
    "recently a subset of the @xmath70 ( nlo ) corrections to @xmath67 have been calculated @xcite .",
    "this calculation involved matching the effective electroweak hamiltonian onto leading order scet operators at one loop . in this calculation , only the operators @xmath52 of the electroweak hamiltonian were matched , leaving the remaining operators for a future work .",
    "taken with the earlier results for the nlo calculation of the jet function @xmath64 , @xmath71 became known to nlo for a subset of operators .",

    "the nlo corrections appear to be enhanced over the lo term , and may lead one to believe that perturbation theory is breaking down .",

    "it is instructive to ask what differences remain between the bbns and bprs approachs once nlo corrections are taken into account ? at least one of the differences is no longer present at nlo . in the bprs approach at lo ,",

    "the disagreement as to whether the charming penguins should be considered to have long distance effects and fit ( bprs ) or whether they are assumed perturbative and calculated ( bbns ) will remain an open question .",
