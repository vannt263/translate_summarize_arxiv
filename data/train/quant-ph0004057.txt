    "superposition states have an important role in the formalism of quantum mechanics . however , they are in flagrant contradiction with our classical world when the components correspond to macroscopically distinguishable states .",
    "the reason why these states are not encountered round the corner is decoherence , a process by which the interaction between the degrees of freedom of the system in question with any other degrees of freedom , either internal or external ( the so - called environment ) , leads to a suppression of the coherence between the components of the superposition @xcite . even if this coupling is very weak , the decoherence rate may be huge , resulting in a very fast decay of these `` weird '' states and in the emergence of the classical world .",
    "recent developments in technology now allow one to study in real - time the process of decoherence in the lab .",
    "for example , over the past several years techniques have been developed to generate mesoscopic superpositions of motional states of trapped ions @xcite , and of photon states in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in these cases",
    "decoherence due to the coupling with the ambient reservoirs was observed , confirming the expectation that the decoherence rate is faster , the larger and more separated the state components are  @xcite .",
    "recently another experiment has succeeded in `` engineering '' the environment in the context of trapped ions , studying scaling laws of decoherence theory for a variety of reservoirs in a wide range of parameters @xcite .",
    "usually , decoherence is analyzed in the framework of heuristic models that describe phenomenological dissipation ( the reservoir is taken to be a collection of harmonic oscillators , coupled linearly to the position operator of the system  @xcite@xcite ) . in this paper , we consider instead an ab initio model for decoherence of a particle in a harmonic potential , scattering the radiation field ( at temperature @xmath0 ) , which then plays the role of the reservoir .",
    "starting from first principles , we show that the resulting radiation pressure coupling with the field transforms an initial pure superposition state of the particle into a statistical mixture .    of special relevance",
    "is the limit @xmath1 in this case , the reservoir is the quantum vacuum field , which dissipates the mechanical energy of the oscillating particle ( or ` mirror ' ) .",
    "this effect is associated to the emission of pairs of photons , the so - called dynamical casimir effect .",
    "much work has been done on quantum radiation from moving mirrors  @xcite .",
    "important properties like the spectrum of the emitted radiation  @xcite , the time evolution of the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite , the total radiated intensity and the dissipative radiation pressure on the particle ( radiation reaction force corresponding to the photon emission effect )  @xcite@xcite have been considered . here",
    "we focus our attention on the particle as the system of interest , and show that decoherence is a consequence of the entanglement between particle and field two - photon states .",
    "this result has fundamental implications , for it shows that any particle not transparent to the radiation is unavoidably under the action of decoherence through the radiation pressure coupling with vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the zero temperature limit was briefly discussed in our previous letter  @xcite .",
    "this article presents results for finite values of temperature , as well as a detailed discussion of the case @xmath1 the formalism relies on the 1d scalar model for the field , but extensions to 3d electromagnetic field are also discussed , allowing us to address the question of orders of magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we start from the hamiltonian model for the radiation pressure coupling , and then derive a master equation for the particle . in section iii",
    "we discuss how the environment selects a prefered basis in the particle s hilbert space , the pointer basis . in section",
    "iv we derive a general relation between decoherence and damping rates at arbitrary temperature by means of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the zero and high temperature limits , including extensions to the 3d electromagnetic model , are discussed in sections v and vi .",
    "section vii contains our conclusions . finally , in the appendix",
    "an alternative , simpler derivation of the decoherence rate is given , which is based on the entanglement between the particle and two - photon states .",
    "most treatments of the dynamical casimir effect are based on the assumption that the mirror follows a prescribed trajectory , thus neglecting the recoil effect . however , in this paper we want to focus on the mirror as a dynamical quantum system , hence the need to tackle the full mirror - plus - field dynamics .",
    "this has already been addressed in the framework of linear response theory in order to calculate the fluctuations of the position of a dispersive mirror driven by vacuum radiation pressure  @xcite , and related calculations have been performed in refs .",

    "we consider a nonrelativistic partially reflecting mirror of mass @xmath2 ( with position @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 ) in a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath5 , and under the action of radiation pressure .",
    "we take a scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions , which mimics the electromagnetic field modes that propagate along the direction perpendicular to the plane of the mirror .",
