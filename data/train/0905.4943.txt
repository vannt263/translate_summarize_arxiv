    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) has now been applied to the problem of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions for almost two decades . since refs .",
    "@xcite , chiral potentials have been deduced from @xmath8pt lagrangians  @xcite through the computation of all nn - irreducible diagrams that occur up to a given order in @xmath8pt .",
    "the resulting potential includes a variety of contact interactions , which parameterize our ignorance of physics coming from energies higher than the chiral - symmetry - breaking scale , @xmath9 .",
    "some of these contact interactions occur in the @xmath10n lagrangian , and the low - energy constants ( lecs ) that multiply these operators can be determined independently from the pion - nucleon scattering data  @xcite .",
    "more of a challenge  both conceptual and practical  is posed by the string of operators that represent the short - distance physics in the nn sector .",
    "these operators renormalize the divergent loops found when calculating the @xmath8pt potential , and so encode the contribution to observables from high - energy nn states .",
    "each such contact interaction is associated with an unknown lec .",
    "@xmath11pt power counting applied to the nn potential mandates that at a fixed order in the chiral expansion only a finite number of lecs enter the potential .",
    "for instance , at @xmath12 in the nn s - waves ( which will be where the bulk of our attention is in this work ) there are five contact operators that must be considered : two act in the @xmath13s@xmath1 channel , two in the @xmath14s@xmath3 channel , and one causes coupling between the @xmath15s@xmath3 and @xmath15d@xmath16 partial waves .    for low partial waves the @xmath8pt potential is non - perturbative , and",
    "the standard approach involves use of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( lse ) to reconstruct the full nn amplitude from the nn - irreducible part  le97,ge99,em06,dj07 .",
    "ksw98a , ksw98b , fms99a , fms99b , be02,ol03,bm04,bb03,lvk08,be08 where parts of the potential are treated in perturbation theory . ) since the nn interactions obtained in @xmath8pt do not fall off as the nucleon momenta @xmath17 go to infinity , a cutoff , denoted here by @xmath18 , must be imposed on the intermediate states in the lse .",
    "the lecs are then fitted to data for a variety of cutoffs , and should absorb any strong ( power - law with power @xmath19 or logarithmic ) dependence of observables on @xmath18 .",
    "a corollary is that the predictions of the effective theory should not depend on the particular quantity chosen to fix the lecs , as long as the kinematic point is within the domain of validity of the chiral effective theory .",
    "a potential which does not have these desirable properties ( approximate cutoff and renormalization - point independence ) is not properly renormalized .",
    "if the set of contact operators employed can not achieve this we conclude that this `` chiral effective theory '' ( @xmath8et ) is unable to give reliable results , since its predictions are too sensitive to the treatment of the unknown short - distance physics at scale @xmath18 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the potential @xmath20 was computed to a fixed order , and then the nn lecs that appear in @xmath20 were fitted to nn data for a range of cutoffs between 500 and 800  mev .",
    "the resulting predictions  especially the ones obtained with the @xmath21 potential derived in refs .",
    "@xcite  are approximately @xmath22independent and describe nn data with considerable accuracy .",
    "however , the range of @xmath18 considered in these papers is quite narrow .",
    "does the fact that these analyses only consider @xmath23  mev represent an intrinsic limitation on the @xmath8et approach ?    in the case of leading - order potential (",
    "which is @xmath24 and whose long - range part consists only of one - pion exchange ) the answer has been shown to be  no \" in the @xmath5s@xmath1 and and @xmath25s@xmath26d@xmath27 channels .",
    "the problem can be properly renormalized for arbitrarily large @xmath28 s with only constant contact interactions present in @xmath20 in each channel  in accordance with the @xmath8pt power counting  @xcite  s@xmath1 channel the constant must be @xmath29-dependent  @xcite in order to absorb a logarithmic divergence .",
    "this violates the power counting , but is of no practical consequence as regards the description of laboratory nn data . ] .",
    "however , once @xmath30 mev the @xmath8pt counting for the nn potential fails in waves with @xmath31 where the tensor force from one - pion exchange is attractive  es01,ntvk05,bi06,pvra06b , ya09 . that counting predicts no contact interaction in these channels , but a contact interaction is necessary to stabilize the lse predictions at these cutoffs",
    "furthermore , in these partial waves it has been found that even when higher - order @xmath8pt potentials are considered and the phase shifts obtained from the lse are approximately cutoff independent , the results can still show significant renormalization - point dependence  @xcite .    at next - to - leading order ( nlo , @xmath32 ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo , @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the @xmath8pt potential includes diagrams with two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) .",
    "since the loop integrals there diverge as the square or cube of the momentum transfer @xmath33 , the tpe must be associated with contact terms up to order @xmath34just as one would have predicted using naive - dimensional analysis in powers of nn momentum .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the role of various different @xmath32 contact terms in the lse was examined and the renormalization of the nn s - waves was discussed . refs .",
    "@xcite found that momentum - dependent contact terms had difficulty absorbing the cutoff dependence at larger cutoffs , and also that the contribution from the ( supposedly higher - order ) tpe was larger than one - pion exchange .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar conclusion in the @xmath13s@xmath1 channel using a co - ordinate - space analysis . ) ref .",
    "@xcite also considered an energy - dependent @xmath32 contact interaction in the @xmath13s@xmath1 channel and showed that the use of a contact interaction linear in energy ( which formally should be equivalent to the momentum - dependent interaction at the orders in the chiral expansion being considered here ) leads to the appearance of resonances there for @xmath35 . in either case , the results of these studies suggest that for cutoffs larger than about 1 gev the contribution from contact terms dominates over that from the long - range part of the potential , raising the question of whether @xmath8pt is acting as a phenomenological fit form , rather than an effective theory .",
    "as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the chiral - symmetry - breaking scale could be responsible for this situation .",
    "this suggests that there may be a critical cutoff @xmath36 above which it does not make sense to iterate the tpe inside the lse .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to critically examine the behavior of the nn phase shifts predicted by @xmath8et at nlo and nnlo in the @xmath13s@xmath1 and @xmath15s@xmath3@xmath15d@xmath3 channels over a range of cutoffs from @xmath37 mev to @xmath38 gev . in this way",
    "we hope to identify this critical cutoff , if it exists , and discuss the signatures of , and mechanisms responsible for , its appearance .    in order to address these issues",
    "we extend our previously developed subtractive - renormalization method  @xcite to evaluate the @xmath39s@xmath40 and @xmath25s@xmath26d@xmath27 phase shifts with the higher - order @xmath8et potentials .",
    "if energy - dependent contact interactions are employed in these potentials we show how to relate the @xmath8et phase shifts to on - shell quantities . for momentum - dependent contact interactions we formulate the scattering equations in terms of two ( one ) on - shell quantities in the triplet ( singlet ) channel and then fit the single remaining unknown parameter to experimental data .",
    "this allows us to easily go to high cutoffs in the lse and provides clean information about the effect of the renormalization point .",
    "our method works for any long - range potential .",
    "here we consider long - range parts evaluated using both dimensional regularization ( dr ) and spectral - function - regularization ( sfr)@xcite at @xmath32 and @xmath41 .",
    "the forms of these potentials were given in ref .",
    "since issues like differing extractions of the @xmath10n lecs @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 could produce sizeable changes in the phase shifts we are not overly focused on the quality of our fit .",
    "instead , our purpose is to see whether these potentials behave self - consistently with respect to cutoffs in the lse .",
    "thus , our strategy is to evaluate in detail the cutoff - dependence of the s - wave phase shifts , and examine the renormalization - point dependence .",
    "these features depend much less on the precise choice made for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the structure of our work is as follows .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "[ sec - singlet ] , we introduce our subtractive - renormalization method and explain how to deal with both momentum- and energy - dependent contact terms in the singlet channel .",

    "then , in sec .",
    "sec - triplet , we extend our subtractive - renormalization method to the coupled - channels case and deal with constant , energy - dependent and momentum - dependent contact terms . while the constant contact term is , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , solved by one subtraction with @xmath48 as input , for the energy - dependent contact term we pin down the three unknown constants with information with @xmath48 , the generalized scattering length @xmath49 that governs the low - energy behavior of @xmath50 , and the phase shift at a particular energy as inputs . in sec .",

    "the short - range part of the potential , i.e. , the contact terms , is a parameterization of unknown high - energy physics . before introducing our subtractive renormalization scheme , we need to decide what types of contact term we should consider . throughout this work we will consider chiral two - pion - exchange  @xcite as the long - range part of the nn potential",
    "this is associated with contact terms up to @xmath32 . however , since for non - relativistic particles we have @xmath51 there is the possibility to consider energy - dependent , instead of momentum - dependent contact interactions . in particular",
    ", this may have certain advantages in terms of evading theorems that limit the impact of short - distance potentials on phase shifts  wi55,pc96 .",

    "in this paper we developed subtractive renormalization schemes which can be applied to nn scattering in @xmath8et at nnlo and maximize the use of information from experiment .",
    "we showed how to manipulate lses containing the contact interactions of @xmath8et so as to eliminate constant , tensor , and energy - dependent contact operators from the equation in favor of pieces of experimental data .",
    "a by - product of our analysis is the result that the momentum - dependent contact operator can not be eliminated in this way , and thus is not straightforwardly related to any nn s - matrix element .",
    "we can still , however , analyze the @xmath8et potential containing that operator , by using a mixture of subtractive renormalization and more standard fitting methods .",
    "the subtractive - renormalization method shows particular advantages in cases where the lecs undergo limit - cycle or limit - cycle - like behavior , and thus adjusting several of them to reproduce data represents a difficult fitting problem .",
    "it is also very useful when carrying out calculations at cutoffs @xmath241 gev , since fine - tuning of the unknown nn lecs occurs in that regime .",
    "finally , the direct input of experimental information allows a straightforward determination of the impact of the renormalization point ",
    "i.e . the choice of _ which _ experimental information we input  on the resulting phase shifts .",
    "looking first at the case of a constant contact interaction , in the @xmath13s@xmath303 channel our results confirm the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite : when a constant contact term is adopted , the resulting @xmath39s@xmath304 phase shift converges and becomes independent of @xmath18 in the limit @xmath305 .",
    "this occurs once @xmath306 for the dr nlo and sfr nnlo ( dr nnlo ) potentials .",
    "however , we found that in this calculation the contribution from the nnlo(@xmath307 ) part of the tpe is larger than the nlo part .",
    "in contrast , in the coupled @xmath15s@xmath308d@xmath3 channels the dimensionally regularized interactions can not be renormalized with a single , constant , contact interaction . however , when the two - pion exchange is computed using spectral - function regularization @xmath18-independent results are again obtained at large @xmath18 : presumably because the short - distance behavior of this potential is the same as that of one - pion exchange , which is well - known to be renormalized by a single constant contact term in the @xmath15s@xmath308s@xmath3 part of the potential  @xcite .",
    "we also considered the contact terms that can occur up to o(@xmath309 ) in @xmath8et , examining both energy - dependent and momentum - dependent contact terms .",
    "for both the @xmath13s@xmath1 and @xmath15s@xmath308d@xmath3 channels , the phase shifts obtained from dimensionally regularized two - pion exchange show oscillatory behavior as a function of @xmath18 when energy - dependent contact terms are used .",
    "this is associated with the appearance , and subsequent movement with energy , of poles in the nn amplitude .",
    "the first cutoff at which such a pole appears in the domain of validity of @xmath8et is around @xmath310 mev .",
    "we also found that cutoffs less than about @xmath311 mev sometimes produced resonant features in the phase shifts .",
    "we attribute this failure to the propensity of these cutoffs to eliminate too much of the central attraction in the tpe that is responsible for reproducing the energy dependence of the s - wave phase shifts extracted from experiment  especially in the @xmath13s@xmath1 .    in between these two limits ,",
    "i.e. for 600 mev @xmath312 1 gev , we found that the 1993 nijmegen pwa phase shifts , in both the @xmath13s@xmath1 and @xmath15s@xmath313d@xmath3 channels , could be quite well reproduced using a short - distance potential that includes an energy - dependent contact term , together with a long - distance potential calculated to @xmath314 in @xmath8pt . with an energy - dependent contact term good fits to the nijmegen phase shifts",
    "can be obtained at cutoffs above 1 gev , but only in fairly narrow windows of @xmath18 , where the energy of the spurious bound state produced by the energy - dependent contact term is large compared to the energy scales of interest .",
    "finally , if the spectral - function regularized tpe is adopted , then the range of the cutoff one can use before the resonance - like behavior occurs is greatly increased .    turning to the case of the momentum - dependent contact interaction",
    ": we found that in the case of this type of contact interaction there is a significant improvement with respect to the nijmegen phase shift when one improves the long - range part of the potential from nlo to nnlo .",
    "indeed , if the @xmath8et nlo potential is employed there are certain observables ( e.g. the effective range ) that _ can not _ be reproduced if we restrict ourself to real values of the lecs in the nn potential .",
    "if we wish our nlo calculation to reproduce the effective range in the @xmath13s@xmath1 we are restricted to @xmath315  mev .",
    "this problem is absent at nnlo .",
    "we examined the renormalization - point dependence of our results , and found that in the @xmath15s@xmath308d@xmath3 channel at @xmath316 mev the results from both the dr and sfr tpe up to nnlo are almost independent of the renormalization point .",
    "however , once @xmath252 mev is reached , the results with the dr nnlo potential show appreciable dependence on the choice of experimental input .",
    "once again , the sfr tpe is better behaved in this regard : there is only minor renormalization - point dependence for the sfr nnlo potential from @xmath317 mev until @xmath318 mev , and the renormalization - point independence breaks down at @xmath247 mev .",
    "the use of a momentum - dependent potential and the expressions for the nnlo tpe should allow us to confirm previous results for the triplet channel ( e.g. those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , we found that if we impose strict relations between the three unknown lecs in order to reproduce particular pieces of experimental data ( e.g. @xmath319 and @xmath255 ) , the resulting fit to the nijmegen phase shifts is in general worse than that obtained by direct fitting of data over a finite range of energies  @xcite .",
    "only when all the three constants are allowed to vary independently do we get best fits , which are comparable in quality to the results in  @xcite .",
    "however , we want be emphasize that this fit can only be obtained for cutoffs @xmath298@xmath320 mev for the dr nnlo tpe .",
    "( for the sfr nnlo tpe , it is possible to obtain a reasonable fit up to @xmath247 mev . )",
    "there is thus an appreciable difference between using two subtractions that fix the zero - energy behavior of the amplitude and performing a best fit involving all three @xmath321 , @xmath119 nn lecs .",
    "that difference is an indication that the triplet s - wave phase shifts obtained from chiral tpe depend on the renormalization point rather strongly , despite the fact that they are quite cutoff independent in this window of @xmath18 .    in summary ,",
    "we have probed the renormalization - point and cutoff dependence of chiral potentials which include tpe when these potentials are iterated using the lse .",
    "we find that energy - dependent contact terms  which might be considered useful as they allow one to evade certain theorems regarding short - distance potentials  @xcite  tend to introduce unphysical resonances in the results once @xmath322 gev .",
    "these resonances are generically absent when a momentum - dependent contact term is employed .",
    "since the @xmath7et power counting suggests that energy- and momentum dependent contact interactions are equivalent up to the order to which we work this implies that the power counting is only a useful guide for @xmath323 gev .    although the momentum - dependent contact interaction does not produce the dramatic failures to agree with experiment that occur in the energy - dependent case , it does have some difficulties .",
    "chief among these is the failure of certain aspects of the nlo calculation .",
    "serious doubt must exist regarding the convergence of an expansion where ( at least for the @xmath13s@xmath1 channel ) lo is in poor agreement with experiment , nlo can not reproduce the effective range , and it is not until nnlo that anything like a reasonable picture of the phase shifts emerges .",
    "the less singular interactions obtained with spectral - function regularization avoid many of the difficulties inherent in the use of their dimensionally regularized counterparts .",
    "the cutoff dependence is almost always weaker , with the cutoff dependence of phase shifts found with the sfr nnlo potential and a constant contact term disappearing altogether for @xmath241 gev .",
    "however , @xmath50 can not be reproduced in this range of cutoffs , and the issue with the effective range at nlo persists .",
    "we conclude that it makes little sense to iterate the two - pion - exchange potentials obtained from chiral perturbation theory using the lippmann - schwinger equation unless one restricts the momentum in the lse integral to lie below @xmath324 gev  @xcite . in this domain , and for the case of a momentum - dependent contact term",
