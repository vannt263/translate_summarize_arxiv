    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions successfully describes nature . however , the sm is unappealing .",
    "for example the sm higgs sector simply models spontaneous symmetry breaking , it does not explain it . furthermore , there is no consistent way to protect the electroweak scale from higher scales , leading to the sm naturalness problem .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a mathematical classification of different degrees of naturality .",
    "it is well known that by replacing the sm higgs sector with a fundamental gauge dynamics featuring fermionic matter fields renders the sm higgs sector natural .",
    "technicolor @xcite is a time - honored incarnation of this idea .",
    "other ways to use fundamental dynamics to replace the sm higgs sector appeared later in @xcite .",
    "the technicolor higgs @xcite is the lightest scalar excitation of the fermion condensate responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the interplay between the gauge sector and the sm fermion mass sector is relevant because it can reduce the physical mass of the technicolor higgs @xcite .",
    "if the underlying dynamics has a larger global symmetry group than the one strictly needed to break the electroweak symmetry successfully , one may be able to choose an electroweak embedding in a way that the electroweak symmetry remains intact .",
    "differently from the technicolor case , here the higgs state could be identified with one of the goldstone bosons ( gb ) of the theory . in this case",
    "the challenges are not only to provide masses to the sm fermions but also to break the electroweak symmetry by means of yet another sector which can also contribute to give mass to the would ",
    "be pseudo - gb higgs .",
    "real progress with respect to the sm higgs sector shortcomings is achieved , however , only if a more fundamental description exists .    in reference",
    "@xcite a first unified description of models of electroweak composite dynamics was put forward .",
    "the description clarified the main similarities , interplay , and shortcomings of the different approaches .",
    "in addition a specific underlying realization in terms of fundamental strongly coupled gauge theories was investigated with a clear link to first principle lattice simulations .",
    "it was also shown that for a generic electroweak vacuum alignment , the observed higgs is neither a purely pgb state nor the technicolor higgs , but a mixed state .",
    "this result has relevant implications for its physical properties and associated phenomenology .",
    "given a possible underlying gauge theory featuring fermionic matter one can imagine distinct patterns of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "first principle lattice simulations are now in a position to answer these questions @xcite .    the classification of underlying gauge theories relevant for technicolor models appeared in @xcite , while for composite models of the higgs as a pgb can be found in  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite it was concluded that from the point of view of a fundamental theory with fermionic matter , the minimal scenario to investigate is su(4)@xmath0sp(4 ) ( locally isomorphic to so(5 ) ) , for both a minimal technicolor as well as composite gb higgs scenario .",
    "the difference being in the way one embeds the electroweak theory within the global flavor symmetry .",
    "this pattern of chiral symmetry breaking can be achieved dynamically via an underlying su(@xmath1)=sp(@xmath1 ) gauge theory with 2 dirac flavors ( i.e. four weyl fermions ) transforming according to the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "we will provide here the state - of - the - art lattice results confirming the breaking of the global su(4 ) symmetry to sp(4 ) ( locally isomorphic to so(5 ) ) , first observed in @xcite , via the formation of a non - perturbative fermion condensate , and in addition we will further determine the spin - one spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : lattheory ] we introduce the lattice framework and detail how the lattice computations of the spectrum is performed ; in section  [ sec : latresults ] the numerical results are summarised ; finally we offer our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the continuum , the lagrangian for our technicolor template is @xmath2 which can be discretized in the familiar way to arrive at a wilson action , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gauge field and @xmath5 the gauge coupling in conventional lattice notation .",
    "@xmath6 is the doublet of @xmath7 and @xmath8 fermions , and @xmath9 is the 2@xmath102 diagonal mass matrix .",
    "mesons will couple to local operators of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes any product of dirac matrices .",
    "baryons ( which are diquarks in this two - color theory ) will couple to local operators of the form @xmath13 where the pauli structure @xmath14 acts on color indices while the charge conjugation operator @xmath15 acts on dirac indices .",
    "we extract the meson masses from the two - point correlation functions @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the quantities of interest are pseudoscalar @xmath18 , vector @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , and axial vector @xmath21 mesons . as a source vector",
    "we use @xmath22 single time slice stochastic sources @xcite .",
    "in addition to the meson spectrum we are interested in two other quantities , the quark mass @xmath23 and the goldstone boson decay constant @xmath24 .",
    "we define the quark mass through the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) relation : @xmath25 where @xmath26    the goldstone boson decay constant can be calculated as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is obtained from the asymptotic form of @xmath29 at large @xmath30 : @xmath31.\\ ] ]    to convert the lattice quantities to physical units , one should determine the lattice spacing for our simulations and the appropriate ( mass - independent ) renormalization constant .",
    "the lattice spacing , in a technicolor model , is fixed by the requirement that the ( renormalized ) goldstone boson decay constant has the value of 246 gev , giving the correct mass to the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "for the general composite higgs scenario the electroweak decay constant becomes @xmath32 with the @xmath33 depending on the specific electroweak embedding .",
    "the actual value of @xmath33 depends on the electroweak quantum corrections , the top corrections as well as the effects of other possible sources of explicit breaking of the initial su(@xmath34 ) symmetry .",
    "the technicolor limit is recovered for @xmath35 while the composite pgb higgs case corresponds to small , but non - vanishing , @xmath33 .",
    "any other value of the @xmath33 is allowed and corresponds to a combination of these two limits . for the details we refer to @xcite .",
    "for definitiveness we present the results for @xmath36 but we will reinstate the dependence on @xmath33 for the spectrum .    the relevant renormalization constant for @xmath37 ,",
    "commonly denoted in the literature by @xmath38 , has not been computed non - perturbatively for our simulations . in this work",
    "we use the perturbative value which has been calculated in @xcite . for fermions in the fundamental representation",
    "we have : @xmath39",
    "the lattice simulations used in this work extend the results already published in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have used larger volumes for the set of parameters closest to the chiral limit .",
    "the bare parameters used for our simulations are listed in table  [ table : sim_param ] , where we also report the number of thermalized trajectories , of length one , used in our analysis below .",
    "thermalizations are estimated by monitoring the average plaquette expectation value and the value of the two - point correlation function in the pseudoscalar channel at a time separation of twelve time slices .",
    "these two quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plaqtherm ] for two representative light quark masses on the finest lattices used in this work .",
    ".parameters used in the simulations .",
    "the thermalization column refers to the number of discarded initial configurations and the configuration column refers to the number of independent configurations used in measurements .",
    "[ table : sim_param ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the su(2)-gauge theory with two fundamental fermions unifies both technicolor and composite pgb higgs models of electroweak symmetry breaking . in this work , we have calculated the masses of the two lightest non - singlet mesons using the goldstone boson decay constant to set the scale .",
    "we performed the calculations with two different lattice spacings . with",
    "conservative error estimates the mass of the lightest vector meson @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "this value is clearly above one tev and outside the current exclusion limits set by the lhc @xcite .    to increase the precision of our results for the spectrum , at least one additional lattice spacing",
    "is required alongside a nonperturbative determination of the renormalization constant @xmath38 .",
    "this would require a significant increase of computational resources .",
    "furthermore we are eager to investigate the scalar sector and the vector decay constants .",
