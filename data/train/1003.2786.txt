    "in the last decade a convergence of independent cosmological observations suggested that the universe is experiencing accelerated expansion .",
    "an unknown energy component , dubbed as dark energy , is proposed to explain this acceleration .",
    "dark energy almost equally distributes in the universe , and its pressure is negative . the simplest and most theoretically appealing candidate of dark energy is the vacuum energy ( or the cosmological constant @xmath2 ) with a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this scenario is in general agreement with the current astronomical observations , but has difficulties to reconcile the small observational value of dark energy density with estimates from quantum field theories ; this is the cosmological constant problem .",
    "it is thus natural to pursue alternative possibilities to explain the mystery of dark energy . over the past decade",
    "numerous dark energy models have been proposed , such as quintessence , phantom , k - essence , tachyon , ( generalized ) chaplygin gas , dgp , etc .",
    "k - essence , a simple approach toward constructing a model for an accelerated expansion of the universe , is to work with the idea that the unknown dark energy component is due exclusively to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath6 with non - canonical kinetic energy which results in the negative pressure @xcite .",
    "this scenario has received much attention , considerable efforts have been made in understanding the role of k - essence on the dynamics of the universe .",
    "a feature of k - essence models is that the negative pressure results from the non - linear kinetic energy of the scalar field .",
    "secondly , because of the dynamical attractor behavior , cosmic evolution is insensitive to initial conditions in k - essence theories .",
    "thirdly , k - essence changes its speed of evolution in dynamic response to changes in the background equation - of - state .",
    "here we only concentrate on a special class of k - essence with dirac - born - infeld - like lagrangian @xmath7 .",
    "this class of k - essence can be considered as scalar field realizations of chaplygin gas @xcite and have been studied intensively ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "since more and more dark energy models have been constructed , the problem of discriminating between various dark energy models is important . to solve this problem , sahni et al.@xcite and alam et al.@xcite introduced a geometrical diagnostic , called statefinder .",
    "the statefinder probes the expansion dynamics of the universe through higher derivatives of the expansion factor @xmath8 and is a natural companion to the deceleration parameter @xmath9 which dependent on @xmath10 .",
    "the statefinder pair @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the scale factor , @xmath14 is the hubble parameter and @xmath15 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath16 plane corresponding to different cosmological models exhibit qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "the spatially flat @xmath2cdm scenario corresponds to a fixed point @xmath17 in the diagram .",
    "departure of a given dark energy model from this fixed point provides a good way of establishing the distance of the model from @xmath2cdm .",
    "if this distant can be measured , models can be distinguished .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the statefinder can successfully differentiate between a wide variety of dark energy models , such as @xmath2cdm , quintessence @xcite , holographic dark energy model @xcite , ricci dark energy model @xcite , dgp @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite , agegraphic dark energy models @xcite , quintom dark energy model @xcite etc .",
    "another diagnostic @xmath1 was introduced to differentiate @xmath2cdm from other dark energy models except of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is a combination of the hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift and provides a null test of dark energy being a cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "namely , if the value of @xmath1 is the same at different redshift , then dark energy is @xmath2 exactly",
    ". the slope of @xmath1 can distinguish dynamical dark energy from the cosmological constant in a robust manner both with and without reference to the value of the matter density , which can be a significant source of the uncertainty for cosmological reconstruction .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath1 can successfully differentiate between a wide variety of dark energy models , such as quintessence@xcite , phantom@xcite , ricci dark energy model @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite , etc .    in this letter",
    "we apply the statefinder @xmath0 and @xmath1 to purely kinetic k - essence dark energy models with dirac - born - infeld - like lagrangian @xmath7 which can be considered as scalar field realizations of chaplygin gas .",
    "we plot the evolution trajectories of this model in the statefinder parameter - planes and @xmath1 parameter - plane .",
    "we find that the statefinder @xmath0 and @xmath1 fail to distinguish purely kinetic k - essence model from @xmath2cdm model .    in section",
    "ii , we will briefly review purely kinetic k - essence model . in section iii",
    ", we plot the evolutionary trajectories of this model in the statefinder parameter planes . in the last section we will give same conclusions .",
    "as a candidate of dark energy , k - essence @xcite is defined as a scalar field @xmath6 with non - linear kinetic terms which appear generically in the effective action in string and supergravity theories , and its action minimally coupled with gravity generically may be expressed as @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , and we take @xmath20 throughout this letter .",

    "@xmath24 is a function of the kinetic energy @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding equation of state ( eos ) parameter and the effective sound speed are given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the definition of the sound speed comes from the equation describing the evolution of linear perturbations in a k - essence dominated universe @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we consider a class of k - essence with constant potential @xcite : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "such models can be considered as scalar field realizations of chaplygin gas @xcite . for this lagrangian ,",
    "the eos parameter and the sound speed take the form respectively @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant ( @xmath33 , but because of the exponent 2 , the case @xmath34 and the case @xmath35 are equivalent ) .",
    "for @xmath36 , the above eos reduces to @xmath37 ; meaning the @xmath2cdm model is contained in k - essence model as one special case . the behavior of the eos ( [ 20 ] ) , being @xmath38 in the early universe , runs closely to @xmath37 in the future for @xmath39 .",
    "such behavior can , to a certain degree , solve the fine - turning problem @xcite .",
    "statefinder @xmath0 introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite is a useful method to differentiate kinds of dark energy models .",

    "at present , @xmath1 of purely kinetic k - essence model is greater than that of @xmath2cdm model when @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while less than that of @xmath2cdm model when @xmath69 .",
    "however , the difference between purely kinetic k - essence model and @xmath2cdm model is nt obvious near present .",
