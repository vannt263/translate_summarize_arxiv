    "[ thm - main ] there exists a minimal complex surface of general type with @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the key ingredient of this paper is to construct a surface @xmath15 with special configurations of rational curves by appropriately blowing - up several times starting with an enriques surface .",
    "and then we apply a similar method developed in y. lee and j. park   to the surface @xmath15 .",
    "that is , we contract the special chains of @xmath16 s from the surface @xmath15 so that we get a surface @xmath17 with permissible singular points .",

    "let @xmath29 be a general fiber of the @xmath3-gorenstein smoothing of @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath17 is a singular surface with @xmath0 and @xmath7 , by applying general results of complex surface theory and a @xmath3-gorenstein smoothing theory , one may conclude that a general fiber @xmath29 is a complex surface with @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
