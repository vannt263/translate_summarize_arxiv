    "most liquids freeze into a regular period crystalline lattice upon a sufficient temperature decrease or pressure increase .",
    "since this transition is associated with a breaking of translational symmetry , it is typically discontinuous ( or first - order).@xcite this is in marked contrast to two spatial dimensions where no long - range translational order exists @xcite and the liquid - solid transition can be continuous , for example following the two - stage kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young scenario  .",
    "one of the few ( if not the only ) exception to the common finding of first - order freezing in three dimensions is a system of parallel hard cubes where a disordered liquid freezes continuously into a simple cubic ( _ sc _ ) lattice at a volume fraction of about 50 percent .",
    "this finding was first suggested for parallel hypercubes in more than three spatial dimensions by kirkpatrick @xcite by using a second order virial expansion .",
    "later , cuesta and coworkers @xcite applied fundamental - measure density functional theory @xcite to parallel hard cubes in three dimensions showing that the freezing transition is also continuous in three dimensions .",
    "the continuous nature of the freezing transition was also confirmed later by computer simulations @xcite where the associated criticality was found to be consistent with the heisenberg universality class.@xcite    in this paper , we consider a more general shape of hard particles , namely cubes with rounded edges . our motivation to consider rounded cubes is threefold : first , it is interesting how persistent the second - order transition is with respect to a change of parameters .",
    "it is known that orientable cubes ( i.e. cubes with full orientational degrees of freedom ) freeze via a first - order phase transition @xcite such that additional rotational degrees lead back to the normal picture of freezing .",
    "therefore it is interesting to which extent the degree of rounding affects the order of the transition , in particular , since the extreme hard - sphere limit @xmath3 exhibits the common first - order freezing scenario .",
    "second , fundamental - measure density functional theory ( fmt ) was developed @xcite and applied @xcite further in recent years towards hard bodies of arbitrary shape .",
    "as a version of fmt already exists for the limiting cases , parallel hard cubes and hard spheres , rounded cubes constitute an excellent model system to test the performance of fundamental - measure density functional theory .",
    "last but not least , it is now possible to fabricate micron - sized colloidal particles with almost arbitrary shapes . in a recent pioneering work of rossi _ et al_,@xcite well - defined colloidal cubes were prepared and studied in real - space by confocal microscopy .",
    "these suspensions nicely realize the hard cube model of classical statistical mechanics . in the experimental samples , however , the cubes typically possess rounded edges , therefore our model shape model is closer to these colloids than the hard cube . in the experiments , the colloidal cubes are not oriented in a parallel fashion . furthermore",
    ", non - adsorbing polymers were added to speed up the crystallization process .",
    "therefore , a _ first_-order freezing transition was found in this suspension .",
    "colloidal cubes can in principle be oriented by external aligning fields @xcite for instance by introducing an inner core with two distinct non - parallel dipole moments , each of which couples to a separate external field . by simultaneously applying two non - parallel external fields , which could be external electric or magnetic fields or a light field",
    ", the orientation of the particle described by its two independent axes can be fixed .",
    "we should note here , that the phase behavior of a system of parallel monodisperse particles with only hard - core interactions at constant packing fraction is invariant under scaling of a dimension of the particle by a constant factor .",
    "therefore , it is not inconceivable that our model of parallel rounded cubes would be realized in experiments , possibly as stretched rounded cubes . furthermore , our work on parallel , rounded , hard cubes provides a good starting point for further studies on colloidal rounded cubes that are not aligned by external fields .",
    "the model for a rounded cube that we use is a spherocube , which can be obtained by rounding a cube with edge length @xmath4 .",
    "the rounding is done by replacing all edges by quartered cylinders of diameter @xmath5 and the corners by a spherical octant such that the curvature is continuous on the cube s surface , see fig .  [",
    "fig : shape ] . if the diameter @xmath5 is zero , the traditional model of parallel hard cubes is recovered while for @xmath6 we are dealing with truly rounded cubes .",
    "finally , in the extreme limit @xmath3 we obtain the hard sphere model where freezing is known to be a first - order transition into a face - centered - cubic ( _ fcc _ ) lattice.@xcite by splitting the particle surface into planar , cylindrical and spherical parts , we propose a continuous interpolation between a cube and a sphere which is similar in spirit but different in practice to the superball interpolation used recently by batten et al.@xcite to abbreviate the notation we define a rounding parameter @xmath7 , similar to batten et al.s @xmath8 for the superballs , in the sense that both @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote a sphere , while @xmath1 and @xmath11 denotes a cube . the overlaps between two superballs can only be detected using an involved numerical algorithm,@xcite which leads to numerical difficulties as the superball s shape approaches that of a cube.@xcite in contrast , the overlap algorithm for parallel spherocubes can be given in a closed and very simple form , as we will show in appendix  [ sec : overlap_and_collision ] .",
    "furthermore , the spherocube is a very convenient model particle for fmt , since the curvatures that feature in the theory are constant on the spherical , cylindrical and planar sections of the particle s surface .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to use the spherocube as our model rounded cube instead of the superball .",
    "we explore the rounded parallel cube model by monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite and event - driven molecular dynamics ( edmd ) @xcite computer simulations and by fundamental measure density functional theory of freezing @xcite adjusted conveniently to the rounded shape . as a simulation result",
    ", we calculate the equilibrium phase diagram of rounded parallel hard cubes as a function of packing fraction and the degree of rounding embodied in the ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the second order freezing transition known for oriented cubes at @xmath1 is found to be very persistent occurring up to high rounding degrees of about @xmath12 .",
    "this gives evidence that the second - order freezing transition can be seen in experiments on rounded oriented particles .",
    "the fluid freezes into a simple - cubic crystal which is accompanied by a very large vacancy concentration in the emerging solid . at further increasing ratios @xmath13 ,",
    "freezing becomes a first - order transition into a sheared _ sc _ lattice and a deformed _ fcc _ lattice , where the latter can have both orthorhombic ( ortho ) and monoclinic ( clino ) unit cells .",
    "our simulation data for the continuous transition line and for the associated vacancy concentration are found to be in qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement with fundamental - measure density functional theory .",
    "the three novel crystals ( sheared _ sc _ and the ortho and clino variants of deformed _ fcc _ ) can also be confirmed experimentally and could be useful for designing new materials with novel optical and rheological properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the rounded cube model in detail .",

    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] and we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our model rounded cube , the spherocube , is a special case of the sphero - cuboid introduced by mulder in the context of second order virial theory.@xcite a spherocube can be obtained by coating a cube with edge length @xmath14 with a layer of thickness @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",

    "in this section , which consists of four parts , the simulations that were performed in this work are described .",
    "first , we determined candidate crystal structures using a recent , but well - tested simulation technique,@xcite as summarized in the first part of this section .",
    "after that we describe the monte carlo ( mc ) and event - driven molecular dynamics ( edmd ) techniques . the structural and thermodynamic properties we measure are listed in the third part and , finally , we describe the methods used to determine the phase behavior in sec .",
    "[ subsec : phbeh ] .",
    "we find candidate crystal structures by simulating a single unit cell with fully variable box lengths and angles  @xcite in the @xmath27 ensemble , that is the number of particles @xmath22 , the pressure @xmath19 and the temperature @xmath24 are held fixed . using periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "this unit cell is replicated indefinitely to roughly approximate an infinite crystal .",
    "the final configurations of a number of compression series form the unit cells of the potentially stable crystal structures .",
    "this computationally inexpensive method has been shown to find all stable crystal phases when applied to a system where the phase behavior was already known  @xcite and since then has been employed to find candidate structures for a number of novel systems  @xcite and also to find close packed structures.@xcite    the variant of the method we use is the following : we run a large number of fast compression runs , see ref .   for details . at the lower pressures , the system samples many meta - stable states . as the pressure",
    "is quickly increased , the system gets stuck in one of these states .",
    "finally , a nearly perfect crystal is found at very high pressure . to distinguish between different crystals we use the box shape parameter introduced by de graaf _",
    "et al_,@xcite , which is the average length of the box edges times the average area of its faces divided by its volume .",
    "the states are divided in clusters , such that the box shape parameter of each state in a certain cluster deviates less than @xmath28 from the box shape parameter of at least one other state in the cluster .",
    "the state which used to represent the cluster is the state with the highest density , as this will often be the most ordered one . in the remainder of this work we will refer to this method for determining candidate crystal structures as `` unit cell simulations '' .",
    "the small system size allows large fluctuations in parameters such as the density , which ensure that all possible states are visited .",
    "however , the small system size would lead to huge finite size effects , if the results from these simulations would be directly used to determine the region of stability and other thermodynamic properties of the crystals that were found .",
    "rather , this method is intended to be used in concert with conventional simulations ( see below ) , which take crystals formed by replicating the unit cells obtained from this method as initial configurations .",
    "we implemented edmd simulations for hard rounded cubes , which allows us to measure the pressure very efficiently and to quickly equilibrate the system .",
    "molecular dynamics for hard particles is implemented by solving the equation of motion exactly .",
    "as such , hard particles perform free motion interrupted by instantaneous collisions in edmd .",
    "event driven md simulations are especially fast when collisions can be predicted analytically , such as for hard spheres , and also for the rounded cubes studied in this work , as described in appendix  [ sec : overlap_and_collision ] .",
    "although event driven md simulations are very fast , we found it to be more convenient to use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the following situations : many non - cubic crystals show a deformation of the unit cell upon a change in density or pressure .",
    "moves that change the shape of the box  @xcite can be easily added to monte carlo simulations  @xcite to accountfor these deformations .",
    "furthermore , external potentials , such as the ones required for the free energy calculations described further on , can easily be accounted for in monte carlo simulations , while they would make the free motion in between collisions too complicated to predict the collisions analytically in edmd simulations .",
    "finally , we want to allow the vacancy concentration to adjust to changes in the density or pressure .",
    "the simplest way to allow the vacancy concentration to change is to allow the box to change its shape in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "a simulation box which starts with @xmath29 unit cells with one particle in each unit cell can transform into @xmath30 cells for any integers @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting vacancy concentration is @xmath35 . in practice",
    ", we use a @xmath36 which is 50 or 100 , such that the vacancy concentration is at lowest @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "note , that the minimal vacancy concentration is an order of magnitude larger than the vacancy concentrations in common crystals ( for instance the vacancy concentration is of order @xmath28 for hard spheres  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the vacancy concentrations in simple cubic crystals of rounded cubes are orders of magnitude larger than those of hard spheres , as we will see below , which allows us to use this simple technique to measure @xmath39 . however , to keep the run time of the simulation limited we have to use considerably smaller system sizes in the other directions : @xmath40 are either 10 or 15 . in the other monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have used a system of approximately 1000 particles unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "the order parameter @xmath41 which measures the degree of crystallinity was introduced by groh and mulder.@xcite it is defined using the maximum of the fourier transformed density profile for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes a direction along one of the cartesian axis and where the density profile is averaged over the two other directions before performing the fourier transform : @xmath44 the order parameter @xmath41 is defined by @xmath45 . because the vacancy concentration and therefore the number of unit cells in each direction can change in the variable box length npt mc simulations ( see sec .  [",

    "we can use the resulting length of the wave vector @xmath50 to determine the number of unit cells in the @xmath47 direction : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the length of the simulation box in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "obtaining @xmath53 in all three directions in this way , we can calculate the vacancy concentration @xmath39 as @xmath54 .",
    "we measure the equation of state using one of two methods depending on the phase of interest .",
    "the pressure of the fluid phase as a function of density is measured in @xmath55 edmd simulations , while the density as a function of the pressure of each of the crystal phases is measured using @xmath27 mc simulations .",
    "we also calculated the mean squared deviation from the lattice position ( msd ) to compare to the fmt data .",
    "for system with vacancies , the obvious definition of this quantity gives infinity because the particles can easily diffuse away from their lattice position by hopping to a neighboring , empty lattice site .",
    "instead , we measure the msd from the _ nearest _ lattice site . however , we need to know the positions of the perfect lattice sites ; specifically , the shift @xmath56 of the lattice compared to the lattice which has one of its lattice sites in the origin .",
    "we use edmd simulations with zero total momentum .",
    "this means that , when a particle hops a lattice constant @xmath57 to , say , the left compared to the lattice , the lattice shifts @xmath58 to the right because the center of mass is fixed .",
    "as such the shift @xmath59 drifts with time , and needs to be obtained in the simulation before the msd can be measured . a reliable way of determining the shift @xmath59 is to use the phase of @xmath60 , which should be equal to @xmath61 .      we know from earlier work for perfect cubes  @xcite and spheres  @xcite that the phase diagram contains both first and second order melting transitions .",

    "we have used this method for all crystal phase with exception of the simple cubic crystal phase which had a large concentration of vacancies .",
    "when the crystal has a nonzero vacancy concentration , the frenkel - ladd method  @xcite requires some modifications .",
    "first of all , the particles are no longer associated with a single lattice site as they can hop to a different site when it is empty .",
    "therefore , the harmonic potential can no longer be used .",
    "instead , we use the periodic external potential proposed by groh and mulder,@xcite which reads @xmath270 where @xmath271 . the number of unit cells @xmath53 in direction @xmath47 and the length @xmath52 of the edge of the box are adjusted to tune the density and vacancy concentration . furthermore , we promote hopping of a particle from a filled lattice site to an empty one also at large @xmath261 by performing moves of exactly one ( cubic ) lattice vector , which allows the distribution of vacancies over the lattice to equilibrate . note , that the center of mass of the system is already fixed by the external potential , so no additional terms due to the fixing of the center of mass arise in the free energy . however , additional moves which translate the whole system homogeneously are required to efficiently equilibrate the center of mass .",
    "finally , the ideal einstein crystal free energy itself is modified because of the modified inter - particle potential .",
    "additionally , the combinatorial free energy of choosing @xmath22 filled lattice sites out of a total of @xmath272 lattice sites needs to be included in the free energy .",
    "the total free energy of the non - interacting einstein crystal reads @xmath273 - 3 \\ln z_1(\\lambda_\\text{max})\\ ] ] where @xmath274 is the factor in the partition sum which results from the integration of the degrees of freedom of a single particle in one direction , and @xmath275 is the zeroth modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "if @xmath261 goes to infinity , the external potential ( [ eqn : uper ] ) can approximated by a harmonic potential , and simultaneously @xmath276 approaches @xmath277 as @xmath278 .",
    "it is this expression for @xmath279 , which we use in practice , because the approximation has a negligible effect for the value of @xmath266 we used ( @xmath280 ) .",

    "the hausdorff distance is a distance on shape space that is commonly used in convex geometry.@xcite in order to define the hausdorff distance , we first define @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 are solid ( compact ) bodies .",
