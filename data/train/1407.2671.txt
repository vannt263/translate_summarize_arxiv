    "there are numerous recent and ongoing atomic physics experiments searching for exotic spin - dependent couplings ( see , for example , refs .",

    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "such couplings are generated in a wide variety of theories postulating new physics beyond the standard model : for example , theories incorporating new scalar / pseudoscalar or axial vector interactions @xcite , long - range torsion gravity @xcite , violation of lorentz and cpt symmetries @xcite , spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry @xcite , unparticles @xcite , and so on .",
    "experimental searches for exotic spin - dependent interactions utilize a wide variety of atoms and nuclei . in order to compare experimental sensitivities to new physics",
    "it is essential to determine how constraints on atomic spin - dependent interactions relate to constraints on atomic constituents .",
    "here we address this essential question : how are experimental constraints on exotic spin - dependent couplings of atoms related to constraints on protons , neutrons , and electrons ?    in particular ,",
    "the most difficult problem is the relationship of constraints on exotic spin - dependent couplings of various nuclei to constraints on constituent nucleons , which requires input from nuclear theory . for the most part",
    ", experiments have been interpreted using the nuclear shell model @xcite in the single - particle approximation ( the schmidt model @xcite ) , but more recently semi - empirical models relying on measured nuclear magnetic moments have been widely applied @xcite .",
    "one of the central points of the present work is that semi - empirical models have only limited applicability and can in many cases lead to inaccurate results , in particular for estimates of the proton(neutron ) spin contribution to the nuclear spin of nuclei with even numbers of protons(neutrons ) .",
    "where available , detailed nuclear shell model calculations can be applied to give more accurate estimates of nuclear spin content ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "in the course of our survey of nuclear spin content and the reliability of semi - empirical estimates , we derive new constraints on exotic long - range monopole - dipole and dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we parameterize the spin couplings to new physics in terms of an exotic atomic dipole moment @xmath0 related to coupling constants @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for the electron , proton , and neutron , respectively ( it is generally assumed that such couplings do not follow the same scaling as magnetic moments ) . in the following we also assume the new physics does not couple to orbital angular momentum . the nucleon coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 can in turn be related to quark and gluon couplings via measurements and calculations based on quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "the relationship of the expectation value for total atomic angular momentum @xmath4 to electron spin @xmath5 and nuclear spin @xmath6 can be reliably estimated for the ground states of most low - to - intermediate mass atoms based on the russell - saunders _ ls_-coupling scheme : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "it follows that for the exotic atomic dipole moment coupling constant @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the exotic nuclear dipole coupling constant which can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the projection of @xmath12 on @xmath13 can be calculated in terms of eigenvalues of the system according to :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , and the projection of @xmath16 on @xmath13 is given by @xmath17    the next problem is a more difficult one : what is the relationship between @xmath11 and the nucleon coupling constants , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ? as noted in the introduction , a first estimate can be obtained from the nuclear shell model for odd-@xmath18 nuclei @xcite by assuming that the nuclear spin @xmath16 is due to the orbital motion and intrinsic spin of one nucleon only and that the spin and orbital angular momenta of all other nucleons sum to zero @xcite .",
    "this is the assumption of the schmidt or single - particle model @xcite . in the schmidt model",
    "the nuclear spin @xmath16 is generated by a combination of the valence nucleon spin ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) and the valence nucleon orbital angular momentum @xmath21 , so that we have @xmath22 where it is assumed that the valence nucleon is in a well - defined state of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "to date , most atomic experiments searching for spin - dependent interactions have employed the schmidt model for interpretation of their results .",
    "however , it is well known that nuclear magnetic moments are only partially predicted by the schmidt model , since in most cases it is a considerable oversimplification of the nucleus .",
    "thus , in general , the nuclear spin content and magnetic moment can not be described by a single valence nucleon in a well - defined state of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "one approach to understanding the spin content of nuclei is the application of rather complex and sophisticated large - scale nuclear shell model calculations , which have been carried out for a number of nuclei @xcite .",
    "these shell model calculations can be compared to a wide variety of experimental data : energy level spectra , electromagnetic moments ( magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole , magnetic octopole , etc . ) , transition rates , and atomic hyperfine structure , which collectively inform the accuracy of the models . clearly , where available , these calculations are the most reliable model of nuclear spin content presently available .",
    "however , there are many nuclei of interest for which detailed shell model calculations to predict spin content have not yet been carried out , and so there have been several attempts to predict nuclear spin content using semi - empirical estimates @xcite in order to interpret experiments .",
    "in general , there are four different contributions to nuclear spin : the intrinsic spin of protons and neutrons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , as well as the orbital angular momentum of protons and neutrons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , where : @xmath29 the exotic dipole moment coupling constant @xmath11 is related to @xmath2 and @xmath3 via : @xmath30 the nuclear magnetic dipole moment , or , equivalently , the nuclear g - factor @xmath31 , can be ascribed to the intrinsic magnetic moments of the nucleons as well as their orbital motion : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the spin g - factors for the proton and neutron , respectively , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are their orbital g - factors . for bare nucleons @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that if nuclear spin content is to be determined from the empirical values of the nuclear spin and magnetic moment , additional assumptions beyond eqs .   and are required .    in the schmidt model for odd-@xmath18 nuclei ,",
    "the nuclear ground state properties are determined by a single valence nucleon ( either a proton or neutron : @xmath41 ) , and thus @xmath42 where @xmath43 refers to the spin of the valence nucleon and @xmath23 refers to its orbital angular momentum .",
    "standard angular momentum relations for a state with total angular momentum = @xmath44 , spin = @xmath45 , and orbital angular momentum = @xmath23 [ eq .  ] give zeroth - order approximations for the @xmath46 case : @xmath47 and for the @xmath48 case : @xmath49 which using eq .   yield the schmidt model predictions for nuclear g - factors @xcite .    alternatively , eqs .   and can be combined with the experimentally measured @xmath31 and the bare nucleon g - factors to extract a semi - empirical prediction for the spin content , which is the approach of engel and vogel @xcite ( hereafter denoted the ev model ) : @xmath50 the ev model is based on the assumption that the even system of nucleons ( protons in odd - neutron nuclei and vice versa ) carries little orbital or spin angular momentum .",
    "flambaum and tedesco @xcite introduced an alternative semi - empirical model ( hereafter denoted the ft model ) based on entirely different set of assumptions : the spin - orbit interaction is neglected and it is assumed that inter - nucleon forces conserve the total spin of neutrons and protons separately from the total orbital angular momentum , such that @xmath51 in the `` minimal '' ft model @xcite , changes to the orbital angular momenta predicted by the schmidt model are neglected , so for nuclei with valence neutrons @xmath52 and for nuclei with valence protons @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be obtained from eq .  . in the `` preferred '' ft model @xcite , it is assumed that the total angular momentum of protons is conserved separately from neutrons , so that for valence protons @xmath55 , yielding @xmath56 and for valence neutrons @xmath57 , @xmath58 and again @xmath54 can be obtained from eq .  .",
    "the critical question in regards to the use of these semi - empirical models to constrain exotic spin - dependent interactions of protons and neutrons is the accuracy of the calculated values of @xmath54 and @xmath59 . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the application of these semi - empirical models to different nuclei of interest to assess their reliability .",

    "the ev model neglects polarization of the even system of nucleons ( protons in the case of @xmath61he ) , since it ascribes the difference between the schmidt model prediction of @xmath31 and the experimental value entirely to configuration mixing within the odd system of nuclei .",
    "both empirical models systematically overestimate the contribution of neutron spin to the nuclear spin , which is related to the fact that neither of the semi - empirical models discussed in the previous section account for exchange effects .",
    "in fact , engel and vogel @xcite were aware of the importance of exchange effects , and used experimental information from mirror nuclei to refine their model to include exchange effects for @xmath61he and obtained the results shown in the fifth row of table  [ table : he-3 ] , which , however , still substantially disagree with the full - scale shell model calculations .",
    "in the case of @xmath69be , according to the shell model in the @xmath70-coupling scheme @xcite , there are 2 protons in the unfilled @xmath71 shell and 3 neutrons in the unfilled @xmath71 shell , while similarly in the @xmath72-coupling scheme the nucleons occupy the @xmath73p@xmath74 ground state @xcite .",
    "the ground states of light nuclei tend to be better approximated by the @xmath72-coupling scheme ( in which single - particle spin - orbit coupling is neglected ) rather than by the @xmath70-coupling scheme ( in which inter - nucleon forces are neglected ) , but @xmath69be is already within the intermediate coupling regime @xcite .",
    "consequently , configuration mixing is important .",
    "because of strong inter - nucleon forces , in cases like @xmath69be where there are multiple nucleons outside closed shells , the single - particle approximation of the schmidt model which ascribes the ground - state nucleon properties to a single valence nucleon is often too extreme and a less restrictive assumption , referred to as the individual particle model @xcite , is more appropriate . in the individual particle model , given an even number of protons(neutrons ) @xmath75 and an odd number of neutrons(protons ) @xmath76 in equivalent states outside closed shells with @xmath77 , the ground state with isotopic spin @xmath78 has a probability of a proton occupying the valence state of @xmath79 and a probability of the neutron occupying the valence state of @xmath80 . if @xmath81 , @xmath82 note that the individual particle model prediction for @xmath31 of @xmath69be is in good agreement with the experimental value @xcite .",

    "the core possesses some orbital angular momentum and thereby affects @xmath31 through the orbital motion of the protons ( contributing about + 0.19 to @xmath31 ) , but the only appreciable contribution from intrinsic spin comes from the valence neutron ( whose state is affected by configuration mixing ) . as can be seen from table  [ table : be-9 ] , in the case of @xmath69be , the ev model gives better agreement with the full - scale shell model calculation than either version of the ft model or the individual particle model , since core polarization of proton spin is found to be negligible in this particular case .      for nuclei that are a single nucleon away from a doubly closed shell ,",
    "meaning that the shell is full in both the @xmath70-coupling scheme and the @xmath72-coupling scheme , configuration mixing should be minimal and the magnetic moment should be well - described by the schmidt model .",

    "however , the agreement between the schmidt model value and the measured magnetic moment is considerably worse in the case of @xmath85k as compared to @xmath86o .",
    "the main cause of this disagreement is that for odd - proton nuclei the magnetic moment is modified by velocity - dependent forces related to spin - orbit coupling @xcite : in the presence of an electromagnetic field the proton momentum @xmath89 must be replaced by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the vector potential at the position @xmath92 of the proton , @xmath93 is the proton charge , and @xmath94 is the speed of light . in the case of @xmath85k",
