    "a stock loan is a contract between two parties : the lender , usually a bank or other financial institution providing a loan , and the borrower , represented by a client who owns one share of a stock used as collateral for the loan .",
    "several reasons might motivate the client to get into such a deal .",
    "for example he might not want to sell his stock or even face selling restrictions , while at the same time being in need of available funds to attend to another financial operation .",
    "our main task consists of determining the fair values of the parameters of the loan , particularly the value of the fee that the bank charges for the service along with the interest rate to be charge over the amount borrowed , taking into account the stock price at the moment of taking the loan .",
    "in addition , we take into account the fact that the bank typically collects any dividends paid by the stock for the duration of the loan .",
    "finally , whereas the client can recover the stock at any time by paying the loan principal plus interest , he is not obliged to do so , even if the stock price falls down , and this optionality also needs to be accounted in the valuation of the loan .    in @xcite ,",
    "a stock loan is modeled as a perpetual american option with a time varying strike and analyzed in detail using probabilistic methods within the black - scholes framework .",
    "assuming that the risk neutral dynamics of the stock follows a geometric brownian motion , they obtained explicit formulas for the bank s fee in terms of the amount lent and the stock price at the moment of signing the loan .",
    "implicit in their use of the risk neutral paradigm is the assumption that the option can be replicated by trading in the underlying stock and the money market .",
    "whereas this is certainly plausible from the bank s point of view , we argue that neither type of trade is readily available for the client , who presumably does not have unrestricted access to the money market ( hence the need to post collateral in the form of a stock ) nor can freely trade in the stock ( otherwise he would simply sell the stock instead of take the loan ) . moreover , while risk neutral valuation yields the fair price at which the option itself can be traded in the market without introducing arbitrage opportunities , a stock loan typically can not be sold or bought in a secondary market once it is initiated . in other words , the client does not operate in the frictionless market that is assumed by the black ",
    "scholes framework .",
    "accordingly , we treat a stock loan as an option in an incomplete market .",
    "we assume that the client can not trade directly in the underlying stock , but is allowed to trade in a portfolio of assets that is imperfectly correlated to the stock . in this way , since the client can not perfectly hedge the embedded optionality , he faces some non - diversifiable risk for the duration of the loan .",
    "we assume that the client is a risk averse economic agent and model his preferences by an exponential utility function .",
    "we then use utility indifference arguments to value the stock loan from the point of view of the client both for infinite maturity , where semi - explicit formulas are still available , and for finite maturity , where numerical computations are needed .",
    "finally we assume that the bank is well diversified and relate the fee charged by the bank with the hedging cost for a barrier - type option reflecting the exercise behavior of the client .",
    "although we present the analysis using a financial asset as the collateral , it is clear that the same results can be applied to loans against other types of assets , such as real estate or inventories , provided their value is observable and follows a dynamics that can be modeled according to .",
    "we consider a market consisting of two correlated assets @xmath0 and @xmath1 with _ discounted _ prices given by @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a standard two  dimensional brownian motion .",
    "we suppose further that the client can trade dynamically by holding @xmath5 units of the asset @xmath6 and investing the remaining of his wealth in a bank account with normalized value @xmath7 for a constant interest rate @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that the discounted value of the corresponding self  financing portfolio satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 .    at a given time @xmath11 ,",
    "the client borrows an amount @xmath12 from a bank leaving the asset with value @xmath13 as a collateral .",
    "we assume that the bank collects the dividends paid by the underlying asset @xmath1 at a rate @xmath14 for the duration of the loan .",
    "in addition , the bank charges the client a fee @xmath15 and stipulates an interest rate @xmath16 to be charged on the loan amount @xmath12 , so that the client can redeem the asset with value @xmath17 at time @xmath18 by paying an amount @xmath19 . at the maturity time @xmath20 , we assume that the client needs to decide between repaying the loan or forfeiting the underlying asset indefinitely .    in other words , at the beginning of the loan",
    "the client gives the bank an asset worth @xmath13 and receives a net amount @xmath21 plus the option to buy back an asset with market price @xmath17 for an amount @xmath19 .",
    "denoting the cost of this option for the bank by @xmath22 , the loan parameters are related by @xmath23",
    "let us first assume that @xmath24 and that @xmath25 . given an exponential utility @xmath26 , we consider a client trying to maximize the expected utility of discounted wealth .",
    "we assume that , upon repaying the loan at time @xmath27 , the borrower adds the discounted payoff @xmath28 to his discounted wealth @xmath29 and continues to invest optimally .",
    "accordingly , having taken the loan at time @xmath30 , the borrower needs to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath31.\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is a set of admissible pairs @xmath33 , where @xmath34 $ ] is a stopping time and @xmath35 is a portfolio process .",
    "observe that the factor @xmath36 leads to a horizon unbiased optimization problem ( see appendix 1 of @xcite for details ) , while the choice @xmath25 removes the dependence on time from the factor @xmath37 at the repayment date .",
    "combined with the infinite maturity assumption , this allows us to deduce that the borrower should decide to pay back the loan at the first time that @xmath1 reaches a stationary threshold @xmath38 , that is @xmath39    we follow @xcite and define the indifference value for the option to pay back the loan as the amount @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41    the following proposition summarizes the resulst in @xcite regarding the value function @xmath42 , the threshold @xmath38 and the indifference value @xmath40 .",
