    "the development of new space instrumentation for x - ray astronomical applications aims towards higher collecting areas , higher spatial resolution , and higher spectral resolution .",
    "this is related to smaller and smaller fields of view .",
    "observations like _ deep surveys _ ( e.g.  in the directions of the lockman hole , the hubble deep field north , etc . )",
    " with exposures of the order of @xmath2s until they reach the confusion limit  can help to study the faint end of luminosity functions and thus to analyse the most abundant sources in the universe .",
    "_ all - sky surveys _ , on the other hand , with shallow exposures but a large sky coverage , are the proper database to study rare objects , with a small surface number density , and also the bright end of luminosity functions .",
    "as an example , the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) with its _ bright source catalogue _ with 18811 sources in the @xmath3kev band ( voges et al .",
    "1999a , b ) exceeded any previous large - area x - ray survey in terms of sensitivity and number of new sources .",
    "_ slew surveys _ play an intermediate role between specially designed all - sky programs and dedicated pointed observations .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "ipc slew survey @xcite covered half of the sky in the @xmath4kev band with a sensitivity of about @xmath5erg@xmath6s@xmath7 ( 0.1 ipc cts / s@xmath7 ) and the resulting catalogue contained 819 sources .",
    "15% of those had no counterpart in the ( slightly softer ) rass @xcite .",
    "all - sky survey extensions into ( and beyond ) this harder energy range have been proposed like abrixas as a path - finder for xmm-_newton _",
    "@xcite and rosita @xcite , but the first failed and the latter is not yet approved .",
    "xmm-_newton _  with its superior collecting area would also be an ideal mission for serendipitous science as already in short exposures during slews enough photons could be detected for a classification of the sources ( x - ray colours , extents , etc . ) .",
    "5 years before the launch the potential of such a slew survey was outlined @xcite .",
    "pre - launch predictions and feasibility studies , however , were based on assumptions on the slew rate of smaller than @xmath8 per hour @xcite ; the actual slew rate of @xmath9 per hour reduces the typical number of photons per source but increases also the sky coverage ( faster slew gives more possible observations and thus more slews ) .",
    "the scientific payload of the xmm-_newton _  satellite @xcite consists of three highly nested wolter type - i x - ray telescopes @xcite and an optical monitor sensitive in the optical and uv to allow simultaneous observations in a broad energy band up to about 12 kev .",
    "the corresponding x - ray instrumentation is made up of the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) . which shares two of the three telescopes with epic - mos detectors @xcite while behind the third telescope the epic - pn camera @xcite receives the full intensity .",
    "in the context of the xmm-_newton _",
    "slew survey only the imaging epic camera is relevant .",
    "the xmm-_newton _",
    "mission planning tries to reduce overheads such as long slews from one pointed observation to another .",
    "these slew manoeuvres between two observations and before and after perigee passages are executed with the help of reaction wheels . in the early phase of the mission during slews the instruments were put into an idle setup , i.e.  they were not completely switched off but did not collect data ( except for a few exposures with calibration filter set - up ) . from revolution 314",
    "( 26 august 2001 ) onwards for slews lasting an hour or longer the epic instruments were set into observation mode with the same observation submode as the last exposure before , and the filter wheel moved into _ medium _ filter position .",
    "in particular , for epic - pn no new offset maps were computed and no changes to the uploaded bad pixel maps were applied . figure [ fig : slewpaths ] illustrates the slew paths in ecliptic coordinates . due to solar angle constraints slews",
    "are performed close to great circles .",
    "the slew rate @xmath10 in the open slew phase is about @xmath9 per hour . as the time resolution and thus the attitude reconstruction of ccd events",
    "is limited by the frame time @xmath11 , any image of an x - ray source scanned during a slew is distorted along slew direction by @xmath12 .    .``large - scale '' epic imaging observation modes , frame times @xmath11 , and distortion of the point spread function assuming a slew rate of @xmath13arcsecs@xmath7 .",
    "for details see text . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ft ]    table [ tab : ft ] lists the frame times for all epic imaging modes where all ccds ( 7 for epic - mos and 12 for epic - pn ) are operational and in the same mode ( note , that for epic - mos the outer 6 ccds are always operated in",
    "_ full frame _ mode ) . from this compilation",
    "it is clear that the epic - pn _ full frame _",
    "( ff ) , _ extended full frame _ ( eff ) , and the _ large window _ ( lw ) modes are acceptable in terms of distortion of the point spread function while the epic - mos ff mode distributes the source photons over a streak of about 4 arcmin during one readout cycle .",
    "combined with the lower effective area of epic - mos the background per detection cell would be too high to add significant value to the epic - pn slew data . therefore since revolution 918 ( 12 december 2004 ) epic - mos is operated during slews with the filter wheel moved to calclosed position ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the epic - pn lw mode is integrating only in the inner half of the ccd area , the field - of - view ( fov ) is thus reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "the epic - pn _ small window _ ( sw ) mode with a frame time of 5.67ms is only integrating in about 1/3 of the target ccd , i.e.  only about 3% of the fov , and was thus not used by us in the compilation of the slew survey source catalogue ( nevertheless , bright sources can still be detected in epic - pn sw mode slews ) .    as the epic fov is about 30 arcmin in diameter ,",
    "the exposures of slew sources reach values of up to 15s , depending on how central the source passed through the fov .",
    "for comparison , the rosat pspc had a 114 arcmin diameter fov .",
    "similarly to the _ observation data files _ ( odfs ) for pointed observations there have been created _",
    "slew data files _ ( sdfs ) with the same files and structure for slews not completely performed in idle set - up .",
    "these sdfs have been ingested into the _ xmm - newton science archive _ ( xsa ) .",
    "the current public sas ( xmmsas-6.5.0 ) is able to deal also correctly with sdfs ( i.e.  event file creation , attitude determination , exposure map computation , source detection ) .      as already mentioned above xmm-_newton _",
    "slew observations started only in august 2001 .",
    "the collected data were not immediately intended for scientific use but rather for background studies and blank sky analysis . in early 2004",
    "the scientific value beyond a pure calibration aspect was queried . in a very first pilot study ( `` pilot-0 '' )",
    "all available sdfs were processed with the standard sas . besides attitude related issues no problems occurred .",
    "special diagnostic products beyond the standard pipeline processing like detector maps in several bands and light curves of individual ccds were constructed .",
    "a robust source search was performed on the basis of these light curves ; a source was identified by its characteristic sequential variation of the rate in a number of ccds . the attitude and",
    "thus the sky position was added later using the time information .",
    "it was shown that in all epic - pn imaging modes ( ff , eff , lw , and sw ) sources can be detected and related to other catalogued objects .",
    "for all sdfs background lightcurves and average rates in 6 bands for the total fov were computed .",
    "the distribution of these rates for the highest band chosen ( @xmath14kev ) is shown in fig.[fig : rate_av_6 ] .",
    "the left panel contains the differential distribution for ff ( solid ) , eff ( dotted ) , and lw ( dashed ) modes , the right panel the corresponding cumulative distributions .",
    "the vertical line indicates the threshold of 5.5 countss@xmath7 as our selection of `` low - background slews '' , discarding about 25% of the slews as `` high - background '' .",
    "note , that the lw mode has only about half the fov of the ff and eff modes and that therefore the count rates are lower by a factor of about 2 .      in a following study ( `` pilot-1 '' ) a number of slews in ff mode",
    "were analysed to verify effects of optical loading and to determine the best settings for image creation , energy bands , and source detection via standard sas tasks @xcite .",
    "as the tangential plane projection is not valid anymore over the whole slew , it was split into event files of 1 square degree size and resulting sub - images were used for source detection .",
    "sub - images with exposures of @xmath15s ( i.e.  close to the end of the slew ) were discarded from the pipeline .",
    "it was concluded to use slew data in ff , eff , and lw modes , and to drop sw mode exposures from the slew survey catalogue processing .",
    "three long low - background slews ( one in ff , eff , and lw modes , close - by in time ) were specifically analysed to identify any mode - dependent features in the source detection pipeline and whether a common scheme could be applied to all epic - pn slew data .",
    "aspects of this pipeline have been described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .      from the abovementioned pilot studies the following processing scheme for sdfs",
    "was set up ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * produce event files down to 100ev ( to be able to later identify optical loading , detector flashes etc . ) * select only ff , eff , and lw mode slew exposures * discard slews with average rate in @xmath14kev band exceeding 5.5countss@xmath7 * construct images and exposure maps in 3 bands : soft ( `` rass '' ) band @xmath16kev , hard ( `` beyond rass '' ) band @xmath17kev , total band @xmath0kev .",
    "note , that in the range @xmath18kev only single pixel events are used ( pattern==0 ) and above 0.5kev also double pixel events ( pattern.le.4 ) , and discard subimages with exposures @xmath19s .",
    "the xmm-_newton _  slew survey catalogue xmmsl1 will consist of the order of 4000 sources detected in the total band ( @xmath0kev ) , about 2700 in the soft and about 800 in the hard bands alone , respectively .",
    "after flagging and removal of spurious sources ( e.g. , due to detector artifacts , optical loading , software )  which will reduce the figures mentioned above  the catalogue is planned to be released by the end of 2005 @xcite .",
    "quality control is a very important issue to ensure valuable scientific exploitation , and started already with the event file creation .",
    "the verbosity=5 log file of the task epchain was inspected for messages indicating possible unusual features in detector performance or data flow .",
    "the special data products described in sect.[sect : pilotzero ] were very useful for sanity checks .",
    "searches for optical loading and detector artifact cases were performed below the actual slew survey limit ( 0.2 kev ) .",
    "an extensive cross - correlation of xmm-_newton _",
    "slew sources with various other x - ray and optical catalogues was performed : faint detections without such counterparts have a higher probability of being spurious .",
    "figure [ fig : aitoff_rass_xmm ] shows the distribution of xmm-_newton _   pointed observations , of slew sources , and of slew sources with a detection in the rass . in fig.[fig : rass_xmmsl1 ] we show the relation of soft band slew source rates with rass rates , where a general correlation is observed ( `` xmm @xmath20 rass '' ) with scatter due to different instrument responses in the energy bands , and also due to long - term variability , but may also point towards residual uncertainties due to optical loading or event pattern pile - up .",
    "we have also checked the slew survey sources that have _ no _ counterpart in the rass and have determined upper limits for the detection to identify further candidates for visual inspection of spurious sources .",
    "the slew survey is almost complementary to serendipitous surveys compiled from pointed xmm-_newton",
    "_  observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the axis programme ) .",
    "this is mainly due to a selection bias because the sky portion observed in the pointing at the start and at the end of a slew is not part of the slew survey .",
    "it did , however , happen that a slew passes over a field that is part of the pointed programme at a different phase .",
    "these cases can also be used for variability studies .",
    "the short exposure times in the xmm-_newton _  slew survey are partly compensated by the superior collecting area of the x - ray telescopes .",
    "below 2 kev the sensitivity limit of @xmath21ergs@xmath7@xmath6 ( for detection likelihoods of 10 and 8 , respectively ) is comparable to the rosat pspc all - sky survey , and the xmm-_newton _",
    "slew survey offers long - term variablity studies . above 2 kev",
    "the survey will be a factor of 2.5 more sensitive ( @xmath22ergs@xmath7@xmath6 ) than the rxte survey @xcite  which has a positional accuracy of only @xmath23  and a factor of 10 compared to other ( spatially resolved ) large - area x - ray surveys ( exosat , heao-1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sensitivities ] compares sensitivity limits of previous surveys with the current xmm-_newton _",
    "slew survey .",
    "the rass showed large exposure inhomogeneities due to the survey design : all slews scanned over the ecliptic poles leading to a significantly higher exposure there than in the ecliptic plane .",
    "the xmm-_newton _",
    "slew survey is not that strongly biased to the ecliptic poles : fig.[fig : slewpaths ] shows instead a wide scatter of slew paths , and due to the significantly smaller fov ( factor @xmath24 ) only a number of crossings of two slew paths and very occasionally of three slew paths ( there are few slew point sources that have been detected in three different slews ) .    when constructing luminosity functions from slew survey catalogues one has to keep in mind selection effects . as slew paths start and end just next to targets of pointed observations , these preferentially brighter sources are included in the slew survey with lower probability : there is a small bias against bright sources . including the target area would turn the bias into an overabundance of brighter sources .    unlike in the rass",
    "where each part of the sky was scanned multiple times ( survey rate in the ecliptic plane @xmath25arcmin per orbit with a fov of 114 arcmin diameter ) the exposure strongly depends on the off - axis angle in the xmm-_newton _  slew .",
    "the xmm-_newton _  survey sensitivity is therefore strongly inhomogeneous perpendicular to the slew direction ( rather than perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ) .",
    "it has been shown that the xmm-_newton _  epic - pn data collected during slews represent an important scientific database .",
    "the catalogue currently under construction will provide a complement to catalogues compiled from pointed observations ( 1xmm , 2xmm )",
    ". moreover , not only point sources but also extended sources had been detected in the slew survey @xcite . while supernova remnants are most likely already detected in the rass , harder sources like clusters of galaxies may be new extended objects originating from the slew survey .",
    "in further versions of the slew survey catalogue it is planned to recover part of the slews that were disregarded due to high background by selecting periods of low background ( using good time intervals similar to pointed observations ) . the slew sky coverage will increase and therefore serendipitous overlaps with pointed observations and with other slew paths will increase as well .",
    "this will greatly enhance the possibility of time variability studies .",
    "the xmm - newton project is an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
