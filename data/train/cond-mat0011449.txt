    "the bco structure is comprised of puckered layers with each site having a coordination number of four . with further compression ,",

    "are observed to transform from the @xmath0-po structure to the bcc structure , continuing the trend of increasing coordination and closer packing with pressure . though is has been speculated that s should also undergo a @xmath0-po @xmath1 bcc transition , recent first - principles calculations predict @xmath0-po s to become unstable first to the relatively open simple - cubic ( sc ) structure.@xcite the calculations find simple - cubic s to be favored over a large range of pressures , with the bcc phase eventually becoming stable at very high pressures .",
    "electrical measurements show that s , se , and te are all metallic in the bco structure.@xcite further , the metallic bco phases of s , se , and te are observed to be superconducting with transition temperatures of approximately 10 , 5 , and 3 k , respectively.@xcite recent magnetic measurements show that the superconducting transition temperature in s jumps abruptly to 17 k upon transformation to the @xmath0-po structural phase.@xcite this is among the highest transition temperatures observed in elemental solids .",
    "first - principles calculations indicate that this high transition temperature results from a moderate electron - phonon coupling combined with a large average phonon frequency , which sets the scale for the transition temperature.@xcite earlier calculations had predicted the hypothetical bcc phase of s to be superconducting with a similar transition temperature of about 15 k near 550 gpa.@xcite as yet , no measurements of @xmath2 have been reported on the higher - pressure phases of the heavier chalcogens .    in this paper , we report density - functional calculations of the structural and superconducting transitions in s and se in the @xmath0-po and higher - pressure phases .",
    "though the two materials are chemically similar , they display striking differences in their properties under pressure .",
    "in addition to the simple - cubic structure s viability as a high - pressure phase for s but not se , the stability of the fcc structure is another difference between the materials .",
    "an analysis of the contributions to the total energy shows that these structural differences can be understood in terms of differences between the s and se cores .",
    "although some of the trends in the calculated electron - phonon coupling and superconducting properties are similar in the two materials , the superconducting transition temperature is higher in s than in se , even within the same structural phase .",
    "a comparison of the phonon spectra and electron - phonon coupling in these materials helps to explain the differences .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we compare and contrast the calculated high - pressure structural phase diagrams for s and se . in sec .",
    "iii , the calculated vibrational spectra and electron - phonon coupling parameters for the high - pressure phases are presented and discussed .",
    "we also discuss ways in which our results can be tested and compared with diamond - anvil - cell - based experiments , including measurements of superconducting properties , transport coefficients , and optical conductivity .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec . iv .",
    "zero - temperature structural energetics are calculated using the plane - wave pseudopotential method within the local density approximation .",
    "the pseudopotentials are generated using the troullier - martins method.@xcite kinetic - energy cutoffs of 70 ry and 40 ry are used for the plane - wave expansion of the kohn - sham orbitals in s and se , respectively .",
    "the correlation potential is approximated using the perdew - zunger parameterization of the electron - gas results,@xcite and the nonlinearity of the exchange and correlation interaction between the core and valence charge densities is treated using a partial core.@xcite the brillouin zone for each structure is sampled on monkhorst - pack meshes of at least @xmath3 points.@xcite      the high - pressure crystal structures considered here for the chalcogens can all be described in terms of a single - atom rhombohedral unit cell with rhombohedral angles @xmath4 of 60@xmath5 ( fcc ) , 90@xmath5 ( sc ) , approximately 104@xmath5 ( @xmath0-po ) , and 109.47@xmath5 ( bcc).@xcite figure  [ fig1 ] shows the total energy for s and se calculated as a function of the rhombohedral angle at constant unit - cell volumes .",
    "the curves for the two materials are strikingly different , leading to different sequences of high - pressure phases .",
    "in particular , for the range of volumes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the simple - cubic structure is never competitive in energy with the other structures considered for se , while the fcc structure is never favorable for s.    for the largest unit - cell volume shown , corresponding to roughly 80 gpa in se , the @xmath0-po structure with @xmath6 is lowest in energy . at a smaller volume of 76 a.u .",
    "( roughly 140 gpa ) , the local minimum for @xmath0-po se has disappeared , and the bcc structure is favored . at even smaller volumes , the minimum at @xmath7 drops below that at 109.5@xmath5 , indicating a bcc to fcc transition .",
    "comparison of the enthalpies @xmath8 calculated for the different structures yields a transition pressure of 120 gpa for the @xmath0-po@xmath1bcc transition , which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 140 gpa . for the bcc@xmath1fcc transition",
    ", we predict a transition pressure of about 260 gpa .    for s , the @xmath0-po structure , which is favored at a unit - cell volume of 56 a.u .",
    ", is calculated to become unstable under compression with respect to the simple - cubic structure , and the simple - cubic structure subsequently becomes unstable to the bcc structure ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "using enthalpies calculated for the static lattices , we find transition pressures of 260 and 540 gpa for these structural transformations . since we find that the structural phases of s differ significantly in their average phonon frequencies ( see sec .",
    "iii ) , it is important to take into account zero - point contributions to the energies .",
    "inclusion of zero - point energies shifts the estimated pressures in s to about 280 gpa for the @xmath0-po@xmath1sc transition and about 500 gpa for the sc@xmath1bcc transition .    in terms of coordination number and packing",
    ", se follows the expected trend of increasing coordination with pressure , going from six ( @xmath0-po ) to eight ( bcc ) to twelve ( fcc ) . with each transformation ,",
    "se adopts a more closely packed structure .",
    "sulfur , on the other hand , transforms from the six - fold coordinated @xmath0-po structure to the sc structure , which is also six - fold coordinated , but is more open .",
    "( the ratio of next - nearest to nearest - neighbor distances is 1.24 and 1.41 in the @xmath0-po and sc structures , respectively . )",
    "while the more highly coordinated bcc structure is adopted at large compressions , the even more densely packed fcc structure is never favored .",
    "the key to these differences in the high - pressure phase diagrams of these isovalent elements lies in their cores .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] compares the relative stability of the sc and bcc structures of s and se as a function of volume . to facilitate the comparison ,",
    "the volumes are measured with respect to the calculated equilibrium bcc volumes of @xmath9 and 125.9 a.u./atom for s and se , respectively .",
    "the total energy can be divided into the one - electron contribution , which arises from the noninteracting kinetic energy and the electron ",
    "ion interaction , the electron ",
    "electron coulomb energy , the exchange and correlation energies , and the ion  ion energy , which includes the ewald energy and a term that accounts for the difference between the pseudopotential and the pure coulomb potential of the ions . in both materials , the repulsive hartree and ion  ion terms favor the more closely packed bcc structure , which has a more uniform distribution of both ionic and electronic charge .",
    "the attractive electron - ion coulomb interaction favors the more open sc structure which tends to have very nonuniform charge distributions .",
    "the difference in total energy between the two structures is smaller than differences in the individual contributions to the total energy .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the one - electron contribution in s favors the sc structure significantly more strongly than it does in se , thereby tipping the balance to stabilize the open sc structure .",
    "further decomposition of the one - electron contribution shows that the kinetic energy favors the more uniform bcc structure .",
    "it is thus the electron - ion interaction that stabilizes the sc s phase .",
    "the importance of the electron - ion interaction in producing different stable structures in s and se can be understood in terms of the difference in their cores .",
    "in particular , since the ne core of s contains only @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons , the 3@xmath12 states in s have no orthogonality constraint with the core , resulting in a strongly attractive @xmath12 pseudopotential in the core region . on the other hand , in se , which has @xmath12 states in the core",
    ", the repulsive pauli component of the pseudopotential largely cancels the attractive coulomb component in the core region , resulting in a relatively weak @xmath12 potential .    under ambient conditions ,",
    "the valence @xmath12 states are unoccupied in both s and se , but with compression , the @xmath12 bands broaden and eventually cross the fermi level . the electronic density of states for bcc and sc s are shown in fig .",
    "the volume of 50 a.u./atom corresponds to about 250 gpa , which is close to the pressure at which the sc phase is calculated to become stable .",
    "the thin lines show the @xmath12-projected density of states .",
    "since the @xmath12 bandwidth varies roughly as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coordination number and @xmath15 is the nearest neighbor distance,@xcite the shorter bonds in the sc structure more than compensate for the lower coordination , leading to broader @xmath12 bands in the sc phase as compared to the bcc phase . with more @xmath10-@xmath12 transfer of electrons in the sc phase than in the bcc ( or fcc ) structures ,",
    "the deep s @xmath12 pseudopotential becomes important in the energetics , stabilizing the sc phase . in se , the sc phase similarly has larger @xmath12 occupation than the fcc and bcc phases , but because the @xmath12 potential is weak , this @xmath10-@xmath12 transfer does not lower the one - electron energy enough to stabilize the sc structure .    similar reasoning helps explain the absence of the close - packed fcc structure in high - pressure s. fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] compares the relative stability of the fcc and bcc phases of s and se as a function of volume .",
    "again the different structural preferences of s and se can be attributed to differences in the one - electron contributions to the total energy . with increasing compression , the one - electron energy in s increasingly favors the bcc structure , while in se it increasingly favors the fcc structure . in both materials ,",
    "the kinetic energy favors the more uniformly distributed fcc structure while the electron  ion term favors the bcc structure . with the deeper @xmath12 pseudopotential in s ,",
    "the importance of the electron - ion term in s is enhanced , stabilizing the bcc structure .",
    "the difference in openness between the fcc and bcc structures is of course much smaller than that between the sc and bcc structures , so in comparisons of the fcc and bcc structures , the energy differences are smaller and the energy balance is more subtle .",
    "this discussion of the differences between s and se and the important role of the presence of @xmath12 states in the core suggests that the heavier chalcogen te should be similar to se in terms of high - pressure structural phases .",
    "indeed , like se , te is observed to transform from the @xmath0-po structure to the bcc structure with pressure.@xcite in our calculations , as well as earlier ones by kirchhoff et al.,@xcite this transition in te is found close to the experimentally measured transition pressure of 27 gpa .",
    "in addition , we find that the close - packed fcc structure becomes stable above about 80 gpa . finally , as in se , the sc structure is calculated to be energetically unfavorable as a high - pressure phase of te.@xcite",
    "the density - functional linear response method@xcite is used to compute the phonon spectra for each structure at several different pressures .",
    "the dynamical matrices are computed using the scheme described in ref . , where the self - consistent change in the hamiltonian caused by ionic displacements is obtained by solving a bethe - saltpeter equation for the change in the charge density .",
    "the dynamical matrix is computed on a grid of @xmath16 phonon wavevectors @xmath17 for @xmath0-po s and @xmath18 wavevectors for sc and bcc s. for se , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xmath17 points are sampled in the full @xmath0-po , bcc , and fcc brillouin zones , respectively .    the matrix element for scattering of an electron from state @xmath21 to state @xmath22 by a phonon with frequency @xmath23 and eigenvector @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gradient of the self - consistent potential with respect to atomic displacements .",
    "this scattering gives rise to a finite phonon linewidth , @xmath27 ^ 2 \\langle\\langle |g_{{\\bf q}\\nu}|^2 \\rangle\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the electronic density of states per spin at the fermi level .",
    "the double brackets @xmath29 denote a doubly constrained fermi surface average as defined in ref . .",
    "this scattering process also contributes to the effective mass of the electrons via the mass enhancement parameter @xmath30 , obtained from the wavevector- and branch - dependent contributions @xmath31 by summing over branches @xmath32 and averaging over wavevectors @xmath17 .",
    "the electron - phonon spectral function , which measures the effectiveness of phonons of a given energy to scatter electrons on the fermi surface , plays a central role in the eliashberg strong - coupling theory of superconductivity .",
    "the spectral function is given by @xmath33 within this framework , the mass enhancement parameter @xmath30 is proportional to the inverse - frequency moment of the spectral function .    in the density - functional linear - response method , @xmath26 is computed in the process of determining the dynamical matrices .",
    "therefore we calculate the electron - phonon matrix elements on the same grid of wavevectors used in the phonon calculations . for calculations of the phonon density of states and electron - phonon spectral function , which involve summing over * q * points throughout the brillouin zone ,",
    "a fourier interpolation procedure is used to obtain the dynamical matrix and its dissipative part on a denser mesh of * q * points.@xcite the doubly constrained fermi surface average of @xmath34 is computed using bloch functions on dense meshes of at least @xmath35 * k * and * k@xmath36 * points in the full brillouin zone , with delta functions at the fermi level replaced by gaussians of width of order 0.01 ry chosen to reproduce the value of @xmath28 obtained using the linear tetrahedron method.@xcite      tables  [ tabs ] and [ tabse ] list parameters that characterize the phonon spectra and electron - phonon couplings in the high - pressure phases of s and se .",

    "some of the values for @xmath28 and @xmath30 listed in table [ tabs ] differ by a few percent from those published in our earlier paper@xcite on s because we use the more accurate tetrahedron method for calculating the electronic density of states in the present work .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabse ]    within each structural phase , compression stiffens the lattice and weakens the electron - phonon interaction , as indicated by the rise in @xmath37 and fall in @xmath30 .",
    "the pressure - dependence of @xmath30 varies from structure to structure . in sc",
    "s , @xmath30 varies approximately as @xmath39 , as might be expected from eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in @xmath0-po",
    "s , @xmath0-po se , and bcc se , however , the pressure - dependence of @xmath30 is much weaker .",
    "these differences can be understood by examining contributions to @xmath30 from different phonon modes .    in some of the structural phases , it is possible to identify specific phonon modes that contribute strongly to @xmath30 . in the @xmath0-po phase of se , for example , there are strong anomalies in the phonon dispersion curves along the @xmath40 to f direction ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath41 direction in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath42 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "similar but less pronounced anomalies exist in the @xmath0-po phase of s. these anomalies are associated with nesting of the fermi surface by the wavevector @xmath43 , as confirmed by calculations of the geometric nesting factor @xmath44 .",
    "the strong fermi surface nesting affects not only the phonon frequencies , but the linewidths as well . the combination of low frequencies and enhanced linewidths results in a large contribution to @xmath30 from this part of the @xmath0-po brillouin zone .",
    "anomalies are also present in the phonon spectra of bcc s and bcc se .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the dispersion curves for bcc se at 120 gpa . while not correlated with nesting vectors , the low - frequency anomalies in the transverse branches along the @xmath40 to n and @xmath40 to h lines nevertheless give large contributions to @xmath30 .",
    "the soft phonon anomalies in the bcc and @xmath0-po phases are more weakly pressure - dependent than the overall phonon spectrum .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath30 in these phases is strongly influenced by these persistent anomalies and is therefore weaker than the @xmath45 dependence suggested by eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in sc",
    "s , the electron - phonon coupling is not found to be dominated by any particular phonon mode , so the pressure dependence of @xmath30 is to a good approximation determined by that of the average phonon frequency .    as can be seen in tables  [ tabs ] and [ tabse ] ,",
    "transformations from structure to structure are usually accompanied by abrupt changes in the phonon and electron - phonon parameters . in comparing the various structural phases of s",
    ", the simple - cubic phase stands out in having the weakest electron - phonon coupling parameters .",
    "the spectral function for sc s , plotted in fig.[fig7 ] , is strikingly different from those of bcc and @xmath0-po s. both the average and maximum phonon frequencies in the sc phase are much larger than those in the other phases .",
    "the higher frequencies in the sc phase are due to the shorter nearest - neighbor distances and the strong concentration of charge along the bonds in the open sc lattice . with these stiff bonds ,",
    "the @xmath41-polarized transverse branch along the ( 110 ) direction and both of the transverse branches along the ( 111 ) direction are nearly as high in energy as the longitudinal branches .",
    "this leads to a phonon density of states and a spectral function that are dominated by a high - frequency peak .",
    "the large phonon energy scale and the lack of low - energy modes that couple strongly to electrons , as evidenced by the relatively large value of @xmath46 , combine to drive @xmath30 down in the sc phase of s.    among the high - pressure phases of se , the bcc phase stands out in that @xmath30 is largest in this phase .",
    "although the average phonon frequencies are similar to those in the neighboring phases near the transition pressures , @xmath46 is significantly depressed in the bcc phase .",
    "this is a sign of the importance of the low - frequency anomalies already identified in the bcc se phonon spectra .",
    "these anomalies enhance the spectral function at low energies , as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , and they have a significant effect on @xmath30 because they appear at low frequencies .",
    "although @xmath0-po se also has soft phonon anomalies , there are fewer of them due to the lower symmetry of the lattice , and they have a smaller effect on @xmath30 .",
    "no comparable soft phonon anomalies are found in the fcc phase .    in comparing analogous structural phases of s and se ,",
    "the differences in electron - phonon coupling strength reflect not only differences in the phonon spectra , but also differences in the electron - phonon matrix elements .",
    "the stronger potential in s gives rise to a larger change in the bare potential @xmath47 when atoms are displaced .",
    "furthermore , because the @xmath12 electrons are more tightly bound in s , these electrons are less effective in screening @xmath47 . in combination",
    ", these two effects result in significantly larger matrix elements of @xmath26 in s than in se .",
    "combined with the smaller mass in s , this leads to larger linewidths .",
    "this is evident in both the @xmath0-po and bcc phases , where the phonon frequencies in s are a factor of two or more higher than those in se , yet the mass enhancement parameters in the two materials are close .",
    "our results can be compared to earlier density - functional - based studies of the electron - phonon interaction in @xmath0-po and bcc te and bcc s.@xcite soft phonon anomalies very similar to those discussed here have been identified to be important in the electron - phonon coupling in @xmath0-po and bcc te.@xcite in addition , the electron - phonon mass enhancement parameter has been calculated to undergo a large jump at the @xmath0-po to bcc transition in te , just as we find for se . for bcc",
    "s , our value of @xmath48 at 550 gpa is somewhat larger than the value of 0.58 reported in ref . for a slightly higher pressure of 584 gpa .",
    "since values of @xmath49 are in reasonable agreement along high - symmetry directions , it is likely that the difference arises from a difference in sampling of wavevectors : in the present work , a uniform grid of points throughout the brillouin zone is sampled , while in ref .",

    "the need to carry out experiments inside high - pressure cells limits the types of experimental probes available to investigate the electron - phonon interaction in the metallic phases of the chalcogens .",
    "in particular , the most common probe of @xmath50 in superconductors , quasiparticle tunneling,@xcite is challenging because of the need to make well characterized tunnel junctions connected to leads that enter the high - pressure cell.@xcite    measurement of superconducting properties such as the transition temperature @xmath2 , the thermodynamic critical field @xmath51 , the zero - temperature gap @xmath52 , and the isotope effect on @xmath2 , would be one avenue for probing the electron - phonon interaction.@xcite since superconducting properties depend not only on the electron - phonon spectral function @xmath50 , but also on the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath53 , it is necessary to measure a combination of superconducting properties to get a handle on both the electron - electron and the electron - phonon parameters . in the weak coupling regime , @xmath2 , @xmath52 , and @xmath51",

    "analogous structural phases in s and se , the primary reason for the higher transition temperatures in s is the stiffer lattice , which sets the energy scale for @xmath2 .",
    "the high phonon frequencies suggest that vertex corrections might be important in these materials .",
    "the other determining factor for the strength of vertex corrections is the magnitude of the electron - phonon interaction,@xcite which is moderate in both s and se .",
    "indeed , we estimate that the effect of the vertex corrections on @xmath2 is on the order of one percent , and can be neglected given the uncertainty in @xmath53 .",
    "although we have used the eliashberg formalism to calculate @xmath2 for all the phases , the coupling is sufficiently weak that the allen - dynes approximate formula for @xmath2@xcite gives similar results .",
    "furthermore , the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the linear coefficient of the specific heat , are calculated to be close to the bcs values of 3.53 and 1.68 , respectively . for @xmath0-po",
    "s at 160 gpa , for example , we find @xmath59 = 3.70 and @xmath60 = 1.66 , assuming @xmath56 = 0.11 .",
    "as suggested above , measurement of the isotope effect on @xmath2 would be one way to obtain more information on the coulomb parameter .",
    "for s at 160 gpa , we estimate that the isotope exponent @xmath62 changes from 0.48 to 0.43 as @xmath53 is varied from 0.09 to 0.13 , assuming isotopic masses @xmath63 of 32 and 36 . to distinguish between @xmath53 = 0.09 and @xmath53 = 0.13",
    "then requires being able to measure @xmath2 to an accuracy of better than 0.1 k.    infrared spectroscopy can be used to probe @xmath50 independent of @xmath53.@xcite in the normal state , the phonons contribute to the optical conductivity via their renormalization of the electronic quasiparticles and by phonon - assisted scattering processes .",

    "the phonon - limited electrical resistivity is linear in temperature with a slope proportional to @xmath66 . like @xmath50 , the transport spectral function @xmath67 measures the effectiveness of phonons to scatter electrons on the fermi surface , but it is weighted to take into account the change in direction of the electron velocity.@xcite experimental measurements of the electrical resistivity have been reported for the bco and lower pressure phases of s and se.@xcite extensions of these measurements to higher pressures would test our results for the electron - phonon coupling strength . of particular interest is the linear coefficient of the resistivity in @xmath0-po s. we calculate @xmath68 at 160 gpa , close to our result for @xmath30 .",
    "we believe this is the most direct way to verify our theoretical prediction that , despite the large @xmath2 , the electron - phonon coupling is not particularly strong in this phase .",
    "we have presented density - functional based calculations on the pressure - induced structural phase transitions in s and se .",
    "although there are some similarities in the high - pressure phase diagrams of these isovalent elements , there are also striking differences . with increasing compression , se adopts a sequence of ever more closely packed structures ( @xmath0-po@xmath1bcc@xmath1fcc ) , while s favors more open structures ( @xmath0-po@xmath1sc@xmath1bcc ) .",
    "these differences can be understood in terms of the deeper @xmath12 pseudopotential in s arising from the lack of @xmath12 states in the s core .",
    "all the high - pressure phases of s and se are calculated to have moderate electron - phonon coupling strengths and superconducting transition temperatures in the range of 0.5 - 20 k. structure and pressure dependences of the coupling strength and @xmath2 can be understood in terms of changes in the phonon spectra .",
    "in particular , the large observed @xmath2 in @xmath0-po s is calculated to arise from a combination of a moderate mass enhancement parameter @xmath30 and a large overall phonon energy scale . the large increase in @xmath30 and @xmath2 predicted upon transformation to the bcc phase in both s and se is due to the presence of soft modes in the bcc phonon spectra that strongly couple to electrons .",
    "we suggest that measurements of the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature , the transition temperature @xmath2 , and the isotope effect on @xmath2 would be the most promising avenues for testing our results on the electron - phonon interaction in these compressed phases .",
    "further , @xmath2 measurements could be used to search for the predicted sc phase of s and the predicted fcc phase of se since our results indicate that @xmath2 should change abruptly when these structural transformations take place .",
    "the calculated transition pressures for both sc s and fcc se are within the range of current diamond - anvil - cell experiments .",
    "we thank r.  j.  hemley and v.  v.  struzhkin for valuable discussions . this work was supported by the national science foundation under grant dmr-9973225 and by the npaci .                                  the bco structure , which is observed experimentally in s , se , and te just below the @xmath0-po structure in pressure , is not considered in this work because we find it to be not only higher in energy than , but also mechanically unstable with respect to the @xmath0-po structure .",
    "the instability is found in both the local - density and generalized - gradient approximations .",
    "similar results for the bco structure are reported in refs .",
    "11 and 18 ."

    "<S> all the compressed phases of s and se considered are calculated to have weak to moderate electron - phonon coupling strengths consistent with superconducting transition temperatures in the range of 1 to 20 k. our results compare well with experimental data on the @xmath0-po@xmath1bcc transition pressure in se and on the superconducting transition temperature in @xmath0-po s. further experiments are suggested to search for the other structural phases predicted at higher pressures and to test theoretical results on the electron - phonon interaction and superconducting properties . </S>"
