    "during the last two , three decades , the field of crowd dynamics has emerged as the _ natural _",
    "sciences reaction to questions arising from _ social _ sciences , population biology and urban planning .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for an example of a problem addressed in psychology , or @xcite for an illustration of the civil engineering aspects .",
    "the roots and philosophy of crowd dynamics are very much in the spirit of statistical mechanics , molecular dynamics , interacting particle systems methods and the theory of granular matter , as such treating individual humans nearly as non - living material ( cf .",
    "e.g.  the nice overview @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "a justification for this approach lies in the fact that the individuals personal will is more or less averaged out if one looks at the crowd as a whole . from this perspective",
    ", it can be considered as ( stochastic ) noise , superimposed on some ` clean ' ( deterministic ) dynamics .",
    "+ to illustrate the thin borderlines between several fields of study , the reader is referred to e.g.  @xcite for the dynamics of non - living particles , @xcite for studies of tumbling or self - propelled living particles ( like bacteria ) , or @xcite for crowd dynamics .",
    "although these fields all focus their own specific real - world scenario , their way of thinking and posed questions are very much alike . +   + however , an evident and important difference between people and molecules or grains ( apart from people s own opinions , irritations etc . )",
    "is the fact that people clearly have front and back sides .",
    "our degree of perceiving our surroundings highly depends on the direction of looking .",
    "we mainly base our walking behaviour on what we see , and clearly what happens in front of us thus has more influence than what happens behind us ( this statement is also supported e.g.  by @xcite ) .",
    "a modification or extension of physics - inspired models is needed to incorporate this kind of anisotropy in the interactions between individuals .",
    "this paper investigates the effect of anisotropy on the global behaviour of a group of pedestrians .",
    "+   + our focus is on the simulation of a scenario where pedestrians move in a long corridor .",
    "we might relate this situation to evacuation of people from a building ( cf .",
    "it is sane to assume that these evacuees have an intrinsic _ drive _ to move towards the exit ( i.e. one side of the corridor ) , and moreover that there view is focused in the same direction .",
    "investigating the effect of anisotropy on the large - scale behaviour of the crowd therefore relates to assessing the escape process .",
    "+   + in section [ sec : level1 ] of this paper the model is presented and explained .",
    "section [ sec : sim setup and results ] is the main part of the paper .",
    "it describes the exact scenario of our simulations and the definitions of the quantities we use for assessing the results ( polarization index , projected density , morisita index ) .",
    "moreover , in this section the simulation results are presented and discussed .",
    "conclusions and an outlook on possible future work are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we represent pedestrians by point particles having masses @xmath0 .",
    "they are located in a long corridor of length @xmath1 and width @xmath2 . here",
    ", the word ` long ' refers to the fact that at the time scales we focus on , the pedestrians are not able to reach the end of the corridor .",
    "interactions between pedestrians are short - ranged .",
    "we therefore suppose that the correlation length in the system is less than or equal to a certain @xmath3 and we can subdivide the corridor in an array of rectangles ( width @xmath2 and length @xmath4 ) , which are all duplicates of each other .",
    "we thus have a scenario with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our domain of interest is therefore a rectangular box @xmath5 \\times [ -\\frac{b}{2 } , \\frac{b}{2 } ] , \\ ] ] with periodic boundary conditions in one direction and impermeable walls in the other direction .",
    "the corridor contains @xmath6 pedestrians .",
    "for all @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the vector @xmath10 represents the position of the @xmath7-th pedestrian at time @xmath11 .",
    "we denote its velocity by @xmath12 .",
    "+   + we assume that the governing equation of motion is @xmath13 the equation describes the motion of the @xmath7-th individual , which has mass @xmath0 and which moves with velocity @xmath12",
    ". however , he / she _ tries _ to move according to its desired velocity @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the characteristic relaxation time related to attaining the desired velocity .",
    "its actual velocity is moreover perturbed by two ` forces ' .",
    "the word ` force ' is used since ( [ newton_overdamped ] ) can be regarded as an overdamped limit of a newton - like equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite for this newton - like way of modelling ) .",
    "+ one could argue whether the social force is the right concept to use to drive the pedestrians , or maybe ideas like social pressure ( as in a darcy - like law ) or cognitive - based heuristics ( see e.g. @xcite ) are more appropriate . here",
    "we avoid any polemic by deciding to choose a framework based on social forces and leave for later any further developments of other possible approaches .",
    "+   + there is a physical force @xmath16 that acts on the individual to describe the effect of the non - living environment ( geometry ) . in this paper",
    "we only take into account the influence of walls on pedestrians , that is : @xmath16 = @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , pedestrian @xmath7 experiences a so - called social force @xmath18 due to the presence of other individuals , which influences the motion of this particular pedestrian @xmath7 .",
    "+   + individuals are influenced by the walls as soon as they come too close , i.e. within a distance @xmath19 .",
    "we model these impermeable walls by means of a strong repulsive force @xmath17 acting on pedestrian @xmath7 : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the unit normal pointing from the corresponding wall into the corridor , @xmath22 is the strength of the repulsive force and @xmath23 is the distance to the wall for pedestrian @xmath7 .",
    "the word ` strong ' here implies that this force is not just a contact force , but has a longer range .",
    "typically , this makes individuals avoid walls before touching them . for small",
    "@xmath23 is the same as in the interactions between individuals ( cf .",

    "in other words , pedestrians interact only when they are close enough to each other ; * we assume that the interaction potential @xmath27 depends only on the relative position of the two pedestrians @xmath7 and @xmath28 and not on their relative velocity .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     to investigate the influence of the initial conditions , we also calculate the morisita index corresponding to random initial conditions .",
    "more details are given in table [ morisita random ic ] .",
    "both in the and in the the mean morisita index over 10 random runs is significantly lower than the morisita index for regular initial conditions .",
    "the difference is even much larger than the standard deviation .",
    "+ however , there is consistency , in the sense that in both cases ( r and ar ) the values are lower .",
    "the behaviour of a crowd of pedestrians inside a corridor , in which the individuals interact via an anisotropic way , can be distinguished clearly from the case in which pedestrians interact in a completely isotropic way .",
    "in particular , we observe the following differences compared to the isotropic case :    1 .",
    "the polarization index increases with increasing anisotropy ( i.e. increasing @xmath66 ) ; 2 .",
    "the projected density along the @xmath30 axis shows a symmetric profile around the center of mass for the isotropic case .",
    "however , increasing anisotropy implies loss of symmetry ; 3 .",
    "the morisita index , as a measure of clustering , depends clearly on the anisotropy .",
    "it increases ( with increasing anisotropy ) in the and , roughly speaking , decreases in the . 4 .   in case of repulsive interactions ,",
    "the crowd tends to fill the whole corridor .",
    "if attraction is included , the group stays compact .",
    "increasing @xmath66 however seems to diminish this kind of _ social cohesion _ as individuals do not look behind .    as a result of our study , many new questions arose .",
    "future research should be concentrated on the following three directions :    * most obviously : what is the effect of a further increase of the number of pedestrians ?",
    "do the observed relations between the measured quantities and the number of pedestrians still hold ? how do the observed limiting values of the polarization for large @xmath11 depend on @xmath50 ? what about the limit @xmath67 in this case ?",
    "+ can we gain more insight in the strange issues of the ( cf .",
    "figure [ niar ] : intersecting curves for @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) by further measurements of the morisita index for increasing @xmath50 ?",
    "e.g.  can we extrapolate information for @xmath70 back into the interval @xmath71 $ ] ?",
    "some preliminary comments in this direction are given in [ appendix ] .",
    "+ if @xmath50 increases , the natural thing to do is to consider the discrete - to - continuum limit ( i.e.  construct educated procedures to derive mean - field limit equations ) .",
    "does such limit exist , can we derive it , and can we compare the effect of anisotropy in the limit to the observations of the current work ? * how much does the large time behaviour of the crowd depend on the initial conditions ?",
    "the initial distribution of pedestrians in this paper is not a realistic situation .",
    "people starting to enter a corridor are in real life never distributed in a crystalline structure . however , for an escape situation ( for example in the case of fire ) it seems reasonable to assume that a group of people starts , being clustered , at one side of a corridor .",
    "therefore , as an extension of this research , we propose to use as initial distribution a more realistic configuration in which people are placed at one side of the corridor , with their positions ( slightly ) perturbed from the grid points .",
    "averaging over a large collection of such perturbed initial distributions , will lead to effective results . are these averaged results comparable to the ones presented in this paper ?",
    "in other words : is averaging the results basically the same as removing the fluctuations from the initial conditions ?",
    "+ in the paper we have included some preliminary results ( in the ends of sections [ sect : results polarization ] and [ sect : results morisita ] ) in this direction .",
    "there we took the other extreme : random initial conditions over the whole corridor . *",
    "what happens if we try to make our model more realistic : e.g. change the shape of the domain @xmath72 , or allow variation in the direction and magnitude of individuals desired velocity ? including more sophisticated active parts in the boundary ( doors ) or impermeable objects within the domain , automatically leads to questions about the efficiency of the flow ( such issues are also addressed e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "which geometry leads to the fastest evacuation ?",
    "first steps in this direction have been made in @xcite .",
    "the issues addressed in this paper show that anisotropy related to perception has nontrivial effects on the global dynamics of a crowd . certainly , these effects can not be neglected .",
    "more work , both numerically and analytically , is needed to extend and formalize our results .",
    "the authors thank c. storm , f. toschi , f. van de ven , h. wyss ( all with tu eindhoven ) and r. fetecu ( simon fraser univ .",
    "canada ) for a series of fruitful discussions on the dynamics of self - propelled particles with anisotropic motion potentials .",
