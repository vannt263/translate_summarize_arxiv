    "over the last two decades , investigations of spin - glass problems have been extensively performed[1 - 20 ] .",
    "it is now widely believed that the three - dimensional @xmath1 ising model shows a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition [ 1 - 6 ] , while the critical temperature of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model is zero [ 5 - 11 ] .",
    "most of these studies have been done using monte carlo simulations , where the thermal relaxation time in the simulations becomes very large in the low - temperature region .",
    "this makes the investigations of the two - dimensional models rather difficult , since the calculations of the physical quantities have to be performed at very low temperature . in previous studies ,",
    "the data in the finite - size scaling analysis were in good agreement with a scaling function with the critical temperature , @xmath7 .",
    "the results , however , have not completely excluded the possibility of a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition .",
    "recently , shirakura _",
    "et al_[12 - 15 ] have deduced the existence of a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition of the two - dimensional models using extensive monte carlo simulations . to clarify the critical properties of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model , more precise results in the low - temperature region are necessary .",
    "the transfer matrix method is free from the problem of thermal equilibration , and has been very successfully used to determine the ferromagnetic - nonferromagnetic phase boundary of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model in the @xmath8 plane @xcite ( @xmath9 is the concentration of the ferromagnetic bond ) .",
    "but , for the problem of the spin - glass phase transition , the transfer matrix method has only been used for the calculations of defect energies and correlation functions @xcite , and has not been widely used for direct calculations of the @xmath0th moment of the spin ovelap ( the spin - glass susceptibility , the binder parameter , etc ) since , when we use real replicas in the calculations , the maximum linear size applicable is one - half of that in the calculations of the @xmath0th moment of the total spins .",
    "thus , so far , no extensive result for the spin - glass phase transition with direct calculation of the spin - glass susceptibility etc has been given by the transfer matrix method .",
    "in this paper , we present a new method to numerically calculate the @xmath0th moment of the spin overlap of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model , using the identity derived by one of the present authors several years ago @xcite . in this identity ,",
    "the @xmath0th moment of the spin overlap is transformed as a simple average of the @xmath0th moment of the total spins with a modified bond probability distribution . following a newly developed process , explained in section 2",
    ", we successively make the bond configurations according to the modified bond probability distribution using the monte carlo technique . in each bond configuration",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0th moment of the total spins by the transfer matrix method .",
    "we have performed extensive calculations of the @xmath0th moment of the spin overlap up to the linear size , @xmath3 .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations in the present method is similar to that in the conventional transfer matrix method with about @xmath4 bond samples .",
    "thus , the statistical errors in the present study are about an order of magnitude smaller than those in previous studies .",
    "therefore , we can analyse the obtained data in detail using finite - size scaling analysis including the corrections to scaling .",
    "our results show that the estimation of @xmath5 is strongly affected by the corrections to scaling in the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model .",
    "thus , there still remains the possibility that @xmath7 , contrary to the recent results by shirakura _",
    "et al _ @xcite which suggest the existence of a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model on an @xmath10 square lattice with only nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the summation of @xmath13 runs over all the nearest neighbours .",
    "we take the skew boundary condition in one direction , and the free boundary condition in the other direction .",
    "each @xmath14 is determined according to the following probability distribution : @xmath15 in this paper , we make @xmath16 .",
    "we define the spin overlap , @xmath17 , between two replicas in each bond configuration as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the two replicas , and @xmath21 is the total number of spins . when we define @xmath22 as @xmath23 the @xmath24th moment of the spin overlap",

    "we show the summary of the derivation of equation ( 6 ) in the appendix .",
    "( for the details of the derivation , see [ 19 ] . ) when we define the modified probability distribution , @xmath40 , for the bond configuration , @xmath29 , as @xmath41 we can then write @xmath42_{p}=      \\{<m^{2n}>_{{t},\\{s\\}}\\}_{k , k_{p}},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes the configurational average by the modified bond probability distribution .",
    "that is , @xmath44_{p}$ ] at temperature , @xmath30 , with the ferromagnetic bond concentration , @xmath9 , is transformed into the configurational average of @xmath45 by the modified bond probability disribution , @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , we can get the following identity @xcite : @xmath46_{p}=\\{<m^{2n}>_{{t_{p},\\{s\\}}}\\}_{k , k_{p}},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 .",

    "hereafter , we explain a new approach to numerically calculate the values of @xmath44_{p}$ ] , using equation ( 9 ) .",
    "to realize the bond configuration with the modified bond probability distribution , @xmath40 , we use the conventional monte carlo technique .",
    "we define @xmath48 as the transition probability by which the value of the bond , @xmath14 , changes . to guarantee that the stationary probability distribution becomes @xmath49 ,",
    "the following detailed balance must be satisfied : @xmath50 using equation ( 8) , we obtain @xmath51 namely , when we can calculate @xmath52 in a particular bond configuration , we can estimate the transition probability .",
    "the processes to calculate @xmath44_{p}$ ] are as follows : + 1)we start from an arbitrary bond configuration . + 2)using the transfer matrix method",
    ", we exactly calculate the value of @xmath52 , and successively flip the bond , @xmath14 , according to the transition probability , @xmath48 , using the conventional monte carlo technique .",
    "+ 3)we continue process 2 ) until the modified bond probability distribution , @xmath40 is realized .",
    "+ 4)we calculate the value of @xmath45 for each bond configuration using the transfer matrix method .",
    "+ 5)we repeat processes , 2 ) and 4 ) .",
    "+ 6)finally , the simple average of @xmath45 gives the value of @xmath44_{p}$ ] with the bond probability distribution , @xmath53 .",
    "+ we now show the efficiency of this method .",
    "we define @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the number of initial monte carlo skip steps , the number of monte carlo steps where we calculate @xmath45 , and the number of independent monte carlo runs , respectively . in all the calculations , we have evaluated @xmath57 using the statistical dependence time method @xcite , and find that the relaxation time of @xmath57 is always very small even when compared with one monte carlo step time .",
    "that is , only several tens of initial skip steps are enough to realize the stationary bond probability distribution .",
    "for example , we have compared the values of the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath58_{p}/n)$ ] calculated by the present method and that by the conventional transfer matrix method using real replicas .",
    "table 1 shows the results at @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "the calculations by the conventional transfer matrix method have been done with @xmath4 independent bond configurations .",
    "the error bars of the present methods have been estimated in the same way as those of conventional monte carlo simulations . from table 1",
    ", we can see that all the data are consistent within the error bars , and the size of the error bars of all the calculations are of the same magnitude .",
    "consequently , we find that only 20 steps are enough for the initial monte carlo skip steps .",
    "furthermore , we have examined whether equation ( 9 ) holds or not at @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath60 .",
    "we have also examined whether equation ( 10 ) holds or not at @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",

    "we have extensively investigated the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model for @xmath69 .",
    "the results of the asymmetric case @xmath70 will be given in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "for @xmath69 , we have calculated @xmath44_{p}$ ] at @xmath62 with the linear size @xmath71 .",
    "the calculations have been performed with @xmath72 for @xmath73 and ( 200,200,480 ) for @xmath3 .",
    "the energy gap between the ground state and the first excitation state is two in the unit of the interaction strength .",
    "thus , in finite systems , any physical quantity at a very low temperature must saturate to its value at @xmath74 .",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the spin - glass susceptibility , @xmath67 , in figure 1 .",
    "we find , indeed , that the values of @xmath67 for each @xmath2 show the strong saturation near @xmath74 , and the tendency becomes clearer as the system size becomes smaller , as has already been pointed out by several authors @xcite .",
    "the binder parameter @xcite @xmath75_{p } } { [ < q^{2}>_{{t},\\{s^{\\alpha},s^{\\beta}\\}}]^{2}_{p}})\\ ] ] is widely used for the determination of the critical temperature .",
    "the value of the binder parameter becomes asymptotically size independent for large systems at the critical temperature .",
    "therefore , the point where this quantity becomes asymptotically size independent gives an estimation of the critical point .",
    "the simple plot of the binder parameter versus temperature is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we can clearly see that the data for different sizes intersect at almost the same temperature , @xmath76 , and the size dependence of the intersection points is very small .",
    "we can not , however , immediately conclude that the spin - glass phase transition occurs at @xmath77 , since the intersection might be due to the strong saturation of the data near @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we perform scaling analyses for @xmath78 and @xmath67 . there is no general rule to avoid the disturbance from the saturation mentioned above in the scaling analyses . here",
    ", we adopt a criterion that every data point is not used all through the scaling analyses , when the value of @xmath67 increases less than @xmath79 in the temperature interval , @xmath80 .",
    "although the criterion , which we have determined from the observation in figure 1 , seems rather artificial , we believe that this criterion systematically removes the saturation to @xmath74 in a certain sense .",
    "consequently , we use , for example , the data with @xmath81 for @xmath60 , and with @xmath82 for @xmath3 .",
    "first , we perform the scaling analyses without including the corrections to scaling . in this case , the binder parameter , @xmath78 , has the scaling form @xmath83 and that of the spin - glass susceptibility , @xmath67 , is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the critical exponent of the spin - glass correlation length , and @xmath86 is the critical exponent which describes the decay of the correlation at the critical temperature .",
    "figure 3 shows the best - fit scaling plot of the binder parameter , which indicates that @xmath87 and the critical exponent @xmath88 .",
    "we can see that the data at @xmath89 and @xmath90 fit rather well on one scaling function , which indicates that the spin - glass phase transition of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model is a conventional phase transition , and there exists a finite long range order at @xmath91 .",
    "the best - fit scaling plot of the spin - glass susceptibility is also shown in figure 4 , which indicates that the critical exponent @xmath92 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath5 and the critical exponents are similar to those determined by shirakura _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the scaling plots of the binder parameter and the spin - glass susceptibility , assuming @xmath7 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite , where we clearly see the systematic deviations .",
    "namely , the scaling plots without including the corrections to scaling strongly indicate the existence of a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition .",
    "next , we perform the scaling analyses including the corrections to scaling .",
    "we take the scaling forms of the binder paremeter and the spin - glass susceptibility as @xmath95 and @xmath96 there is little quantitative change in figures 3 and 4 , even though we fit the data using equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "thus , when we assume @xmath97 , the effect of the corrections to scaling is rather small . on the other hand , assuming that @xmath7 , @xmath93 and @xmath98 @xcite , the data of the binder parameter and the spin - glass susceptibility fit very well on one scaling function , respectively , as shown in figures 7 and 8 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , although the data with a small linear size , @xmath60 , deviate from the scaling function .",
    "( to fit the data , we use @xmath98 , which is , for example , consistent with the result in [ 8 ] , @xmath101 . ) thus , including the corrections to scaling , both @xmath7 and @xmath102 are consistent with the scaling analyses .",
    "furthermore , we find that every temperature for @xmath103 might become the critical temperature , @xmath5 , in this scaling form . consequently , we find that the estimation of the value of @xmath5 is strongly affected by the corrections to scaling in the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model within the present data ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we have developed a new method to numerically calculate @xmath44_{p}$ ] of the two - dimensional @xmath1 ising model , where , using a local gauge transformation , @xmath44_{p}$ ] can be calculated as a simple average of @xmath45 with a modified bond probability distribution . by using the present method , we have extensively calculated the values of @xmath44_{p}$ ] , where the statistical errors become about an order of magnitude smaller than in previous studies , and we have investigated the scaling analyses including the corrections to scaling . by using the scaling analyses without including the corrections to scaling ,",
    "our data strongly indicate a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition .",
    "we find , however , that the estimation of @xmath104 is strongly affected by the corrections to scaling within the data with @xmath6 , and that every temperature for @xmath103 might be able to become the critical temperature .",
    "consequently , our results indicate that there still remains the possibility that @xmath105 , contrary to the recent results of shirakura _ et al _ @xcite which suggest the existence of a finite - temperature spin - glass phase transition .",
