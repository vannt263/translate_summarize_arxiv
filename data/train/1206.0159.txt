    "the breit - wheeler process [ 1 ] , @xmath2 , describes pair production as a @xmath3 channel process , which is sometimes termed `` conversion of light into matter '' . considering it as 2-to-2 process in a particle physics language ,",
    "the breit - wheeler pair creation is a threshold process , i.e.  the available energy , expressed by the mandelstam variable @xmath4 , must fulfill @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electron mass .",
    "supposed , @xmath7 describes optical ( laser ) photons with energy @xmath8 ev , the energy of the counter propagating photon @xmath9 must obey @xmath10 gev .",
    "while such high energy photons might be generated by various processes at high energy accelerators / colliders , e.g.  in the time reversed breit - wheeler process ( pair annihilation ) or compton backscattering of a laser beam off a very energetic electron beam , or in astrophysical environments , the availability of laboratory based 250 gev photon sources is quite scarce .",
    "nevertheless , the breit - wheeler process has been identified experimentally .",
    "the slac experiment e-144 @xcite was a special set - up of one of the above mentioned options .    in a sufficiently strong laser field ,",
    "however , multi - photon processes are enabled @xcite , schematically @xmath11 , often termed nonlinear breit - wheeler process .",
    "indeed , the interpretation @xcite of the slac experiment e-144 has proved this possibility .",
    "in fact , at least @xmath12 laser photons were needed to produce a pair .",
    "for an all - optical set - up with @xmath13 , @xmath14 laser photons would be required when replacing in the above threshold formula @xmath15 .",
    "strong laser fields are necessary for such nonlinear effects .",
    "the electron and positron in a strong laser field acquire an effective mass , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimensionless laser - strength parameter ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent analysis of the mass dressing in strong pulsed laser fields ) .",
    "that is , the above threshold estimate would read @xmath18 in disfavor of achieving the threshold for strong optical laser fields .",
    "the up - shift of the threshold , however , is compensated to some extent by the higher harmonics with thresholds @xmath19 .",
    "that means , in principle , the higher harmonics ( labelled by @xmath20 ) seem to shift the threshold towards arbitrarily small values of @xmath21 . for a given value of @xmath21 ,",
    "the minimum number of laser photons @xmath22 is the smallest integer such that @xmath23 . in the perturbative regime , where @xmath24 , the harmonics are suppressed by factors of @xmath25 , and a noticeable pair production",
    "therefore extents not too far below the 2-to-2 threshold of @xmath26 . in the deep subthreshold region @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "a large number of laser photons participate in the formation of pair with cross section @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ritus parameter for pair production @xcite .",
    "it has a similar non - analytic dependence on the field strength parameter encoded in @xmath31 as the schwinger effect which depends on the electric field amplitude ( cf .",
    "@xcite . ) at fixed @xmath17 , there is a steep decline of the pair creation probability for @xmath32 , i.e.  large values of @xmath17 shift the region of noticeable pair production to small values of @xmath21 .",
    "the cross section for pair production in the nonlinear breit - wheeler process by an unpolarized probe photon @xmath9 in a plane wave with linear polarization reads in such a case @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 are generalized bessel functions with arguments @xmath20 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 .",

    "the overall pattern remains , but with less pronounced structures due to azimuthal symmetry . in the strong - field region , @xmath27 , the subthreshold production with a large number of photons is suppressed due to the large angular momentum of the pair @xcite .",
    "the hitherto discussed examples are for infinitely extended plane waves . in reality",
    ", strong laser fields are generated presently by the chirped pulse amplification technique , i.e. pulse compression , and the asymptotic final state refers to a free electron - positron pair , where @xmath48 does not matter .",
    "therefore , a modified threshold behavior is to be expected .",
    "moreover , a pulse of finite duration is not longer monochromatic , instead the power spectrum has a support of finite width .",
    "also this effect will have imprints on the pair production , as does the variation of the intensity in the course of the pulse .",
    "considering the ( nonlinear ) breit - wheeler process as cross channel of the ( nonlinear ) compton scattering one can expect similar strong effects of the temporal pulse shape , as has been found for the latter one @xcite .",
    "in fact , the differential @xmath0 spectra in the ( general ) breit - wheeler process depend sensitively on the laser pulse shape @xcite . even for weak laser intensities",

    "the summary is given in section 5 .",
    "the pair creation process is a crossing channel of the compton scattering .",
    "accordingly , we evaluate the cross section of the process as decay of a probe photon @xmath9 with four - momentum @xmath49 and polarization four - vector @xmath50 into a pair @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are laser dressed volkov states ( cf .",

    "we apply here a simple folding model to explain in an alternative and more intuitive manner the effect .",
    "the key is the finite bandwidth of a pulse : the power spectrum contains frequencies lower and larger than the central value @xmath124 .",
    "this is accounted for in our model by calculating the weighted average of the pair production cross section of all energy components which are present in the laser pulse .",

    "that means , the relative importance of different harmonics depends on the shape of the pulse . if the frequency distribution does not matter , such as for long pulses with @xmath142 , the effect of the intensity distribution for @xmath24 causes @xmath143 in ( [ eq.convolution ] ) .",

    "although a pair emerges finally with asymptotically free @xmath53 masses @xmath6 , the mass shift during the production of the pair still leaves imprints on the differential spectra in a pulsed field @xcite .",
    "focussing now on these intensity effects for larger values of @xmath17 , one can define @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the non - perturbative cross section in ipa related to the first harmonic , i.e.@xmath157 from eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) .",
    "that folding model approximates quite well the spectrum obtained in the previous section . for a comparison with numerical results , a suitable cut in phase space ,",
    "e.g.  @xmath158 ( this value is dictated by the lowest gap in the @xmath159 differential spectrum for not too large values of @xmath17 and not too short pulses ) , separates here the first fpa harmonic thus defining @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] clearly exhibits the shift of the threshold from @xmath154 towards @xmath161 even for @xmath152 , i.e. , the ipa threshold @xmath154 is replaced by the fpa threshold @xmath162 for smooth pulses .",
    "however , already at the ipa threshold @xmath163 the cross section @xmath151 starts dropping when going to smaller values of @xmath41 .",
    "this behavior is much more prominent for pulses with a pronounced flat - top section .",
    "the shape of the curve @xmath151 as a function of @xmath41 again is sensitive to the pulse shape but not to @xmath67 .",
    "the excess at @xmath164 is due to effects of the frequency spectrum discussed above .",
    "this simple model consideration demonstrates the physics content of the pair production process in pulsed laser fields by identifying two regimes ( i ) @xmath165 , where the frequency distribution essentially determines the spectrum , and ( ii ) @xmath166 , @xmath167 , where the intensity variation in the pulse plays an important role .",
    "our findings may help to improve simulations of cascade formation @xcite which are based on certain parameterizations of the pair production cross section .",
    "in summary we have shown that for short weak and medium - intense laser pulses the generalized nonlinear breit - wheeler process is strongly ( order of magnitudes ) enhanced in the subthreshold region @xmath168 .",
    "the effect is similar for linear and circular polarizations .",
    "while a qualitative explanation was given in @xcite for circular polarization , one may attribute the enhanced subthreshold pair production to the non - monochromaticity of the laser pulse due to its finite duration .",
    "this complements the strong impact of the temporal pulse shape on the multi - differential spectra found in @xcite .",
    "effectively , the high - frequency content of a pulsed laser field leads to a decrease of the threshold harmonic @xmath22 for given value of @xmath41 .",
    "the nonlinear ( multi - photon ) compton process as crossing channel of the breit - wheeler process has shown an analog sensitivity to the temporal beam shape @xcite .",
    "our analysis evidences that pair production in pulsed laser fields depends sensitively on both the frequency spectrum and the intensity variation in the course of the pulse .",
    "modelling the pulse by a box shape one would ignore the intensity variation which is particularly important for stronger laser fields with @xmath27 and higher harmonics with @xmath169 .",
    "the pair production is an important step in the formation of qed cascades @xcite which are thought to become important in high - intense laser fields .",
