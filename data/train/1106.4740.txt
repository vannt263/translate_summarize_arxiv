    "one of the central questions in modern physics concerns the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "the crs themselves do not directly reveal their sources as they interact with cosmic magnetic fields and particles on their way through the universe @xcite .",
    "one method of identifying cr sources indirectly is the search for high - energy photon or neutrino signals . when protons of energy @xmath3  mev interact with photon or matter fields in the vicinity of the cr production site , charged and neutral pions are produced , which then emit high - energy neutrinos and photons .",
    "those neutral particles can be used to trace crs , as they point back to the sources .",
    "this approach is limited by ( a ) the low interaction cross sections that make neutrinos difficult to detect @xcite , and ( b ) the competition with processes like inverse compton scattering and bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to use multiwavelength approaches to identify cr sources through correlation studies , and not to rely solely on the observation of high - energy photons .",
    "the illumination of molecular clouds by crs from supernova remnants ( snrs ) was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "most recently , observations performed with the fermi telescope have revealed high - energy emission from several regions associated with a snr located in close proximity to molecular clouds ( mcs ) . in particular , emission at 0.2 to 200 gev",
    "has been detected towards the snrs w51c @xcite , w28 @xcite , w44 @xcite , w49b @xcite and ic443 @xcite .",
    "snrs are one of the primary candidates for cr acceleration , as discussed for example by @xcite",
    ". the observed gamma - ray signatures could therefore be interpreted as @xmath4decay products from high - energy cr interactions with the mc .",
    "the data for these particular objects actually seem to favor a hadronic scenario over a leptonic one , see e.g.  @xcite . due to the ambiguity of the signal , however , other tracers of crs are needed to have a final proof .    in this paper , we quantify a new method to identify snrs as cr sources , based on cr - induced ionization .",
    "when crs are accelerated in a snr and then injected into a nearby mc , the ionization rate in the ambient gas is expected to be enhanced compared with the ionization caused by the general background of galactic crs .",
    "the immediate products are hydrogen ions , h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 , which react rapidly with h@xmath7 and oxygen to form molecular ions .",
    "ions like h@xmath2 , oh@xmath5 , h@xmath7o@xmath5 , and h@xmath8o@xmath5 are spectroscopically observable at infrared and submm wavelengths and their abundances are predictable as functions of the ionization rate ( e.g.  @xcite ) . among the 18 molecular cations now identified in the interstellar medium ,",
    "it is the reactive ions h@xmath2 , oh@xmath5 , and h@xmath7o@xmath5 that are expected to be the most specific tracers of the cr ionization rate @xcite , and it was only during the last year that the latter two species have been detected @xcite .",
    "analysis of oh@xmath5 and h@xmath7o@xmath5 absorption in diffuse interstellar gas of low molecular fraction ( h@xmath7/h @xmath9% ) serves to calibrate the background ionizing frequency of interstellar hydrogen at a level @xmath10s@xmath11 per atom @xcite .",
    "here , we estimate the enhanced interstellar ionization rates expected from the observed fluxes of high - energy gamma rays toward snrs and predict the abundances of reactive molecular ions to be expected in associated mcs .",
    "we show how correlations between gev - tev emission and vibrational and rotational spectra of molecular ions could be used to identify the sites of cr acceleration .",
    "observational tests will be possible through astronomical spectroscopy at infrared and mm / submm wavelengths .",
    "crs of kinetic energies between @xmath12  mev and @xmath13  gev ionize the interstellar medium , while those at lower energy hardly escape their sources .",
    "we investigate five snrs located in or close to mcs , which are detected in gamma - rays .",
    "the cr spectra , further used to calculate the ionization rate , can be deduced from the measured gamma - ray flux at earth : @xmath14 assuming that the photons arise from hadronic interactions between the snr and the mc , a primary cr spectrum can be derived .",
    "we assume a smoothed broken power - law for the primaries : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the proton spectrum normalization and @xmath17 the location of the spectral break .",
    "for all sources , this shape of the primary spectrum reproduces the shape of the observed photon spectrum .",
    "our results generally follow the original calculations by fermi , @xcite with slight modifications of the smoothing of the power - law , only giving minor changes to the result .",
    "we use the parametrization of the cr interaction model as presented in @xcite to derive the primary spectrum from the gamma - ray observation .",
    "we use a fixed value of the hydrogen density , @xmath18 @xmath19 and determine the cr energy @xmath20 needed to provide the observed gamma - ray flux .",
    "the volume of the emitting region @xmath21 enters the normalization of the proton spectrum .",
    "it can be derived from gamma - observations and is taken from the fermi publications .",
    "the spectral parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath17 , the total energy budget of interacting protons , @xmath20 and the volume @xmath21 are listed in table [ params : tab ] .",
    "to calculate the ionization rate , we use the parametrization from @xcite , including ionization by cr electrons , cr protons and electron capture by cr protons .",
    "only the direct ionization by primary protons turns out to be significant , the other contributions being at least one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the ionization rate of h@xmath7 by primary protons reduces to @xmath24 with @xmath25 as the cr spectrum at a given kinetic energy @xmath26 .",
    "the upper integration limit is set to @xmath27 1 gev , as the rapidly decreasing cross section makes contributions at higher energies negligible .",
    "there are two main factors affecting the ionization rate :    * the cr spectrum at earth as measured below @xmath13  gev is modified from the spectrum at the source by transport effects of the ism and the solar environment .",
    "the particle spectrum at the source can be derived from gamma - ray data up to approximately @xmath28  gev , but it must be estimated theoretically at lower energies . the simplest approach is to extrapolate the spectrum towards lower energies , assuming that the acceleration mechanism works the same way at mev energies .",
    "however , low - energy particles might follow a different acceleration scheme and produce a flatter or curved spectrum , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this might lead to an overestimation of the spectrum at the lowest energies .",
    "however , it is not clear yet at what energy this will start exactly . *",
    "the choice of lower energy threshold @xmath29 is related to propagation effects .",
    "the range of a 1 mev proton in hydrogen is @xmath30 g @xmath31 , which corresponds to a projected column density of @xmath32 h @xmath31 .",
    "this is easily able to support detectable abundances of oh@xmath5 and h@xmath7o@xmath5 in the diffuse molecular gas of the galaxy . in @xcite , a threshold of @xmath33 mev",
    "is recommended for diffuse clouds with hydrogen number densities @xmath34@xmath19 , and @xmath35  mev for dense clouds , where @xmath36@xmath19 .",
    "close to a cr accelerator , at an average density of @xmath37  @xmath19 , values above 2  mev are reasonable choices to account for the stopping range .",
    "we chose the following approach to account for these uncertainties : we first assume that the spectrum continues as a power - law down to mev energies .",
    "we then introduce an artificial and sharp cutoff in the spectrum at a minimum kinetic energy @xmath29 , below which the cr flux is set to zero .",
    "we then vary the minimum energy between @xmath38  mev and @xmath37  mev .",
    "as the cr ionization cross section decreases with energy , increasing the threshold will remove much of the potential signal , having an even more extreme effect than flattening the cr spectrum . increasing the threshold at the same time accounts for considering different stopping ranges . at this stage , due to the lack of knowledge of the lower part of the spectrum",
    ", we will calculate the possible range of ionization intensity rather than one specific value .",
    "dependence of the ionization rate , normalized to the average galactic value of @xmath39  s@xmath11 , on @xmath29 . , width=377 ]    figure [ fig : all ] shows the ionization rate , normalized to galactic average , versus the minimum energy . for comparison , the stopping range is shown as a function of @xmath29 . for the most optimistic scenario , still compatible with current knowledge , @xmath40  mev , ionization rates range from @xmath41 to @xmath42 times the galactic average .",
    "an energy cutoff at @xmath37  mev leaves w49b as an outstanding source with a factor of @xmath43 above galactic average .",
    "the central reason is the large cr energy density in this source @xcite . at @xmath44  mev , only w51c drops to values below @xmath45 .",
    "all other sources remain a factor of a few to ten above the background .",
    "note that we do not include the additional ionization by energetic secondary electrons being produced in the primary ionizing event .",
    "these secondary ionizations increase the total rate by factors of a few ( cf .",
    "padovani et al .",
    "2009 ) , but the details are sensitive to the relative abundances of h , h@xmath7 , e@xmath46 , and he @xcite .",
    "the escape of crs from their sources and their propagation into surrounding material are also affected in complicated ways by interaction with magnetic fields ( see @xcite for a recent discussion for dense molecular gas ) .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future work .",
    "as shown below , the observable line intensities of molecular ions spawned by cr ionization depend upon the ionization rate integrated through a column of molecular gas @xmath47 which we call the _ cosmic ray exposure_. the number density of interstellar h@xmath7 is @xmath48 and the integration is over path length @xmath49 to @xmath50 . because the crs of shortest range die off at small @xmath51 , protons at energies significantly greater than @xmath52 contribute to the exposure . in principle",
    ", the exposure should be computed through an explicit depth - integration of the discrete energy loss .",
    "the snrs discussed in this context have a cr exposure of the order of @xmath53 s@xmath11 @xmath31 or higher ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) , which is @xmath54 times larger than the exposures that characterize diffuse clouds in the galactic disk . in general , ionization by x - rays can produce similar chemical signatures .",
    "we expect the x - rays from snrs to be much less important than crs because the x - ray luminosities are relatively small and their depths of penetration are too short to yield high values of the exposure .",
    "the outlines of interstellar ion chemistry have been understood for almost 40 years @xcite and the rate coefficients of all the crucial reactions are well determined . in steady state between the rates of source and",
    "sink reactions , the number densities of the transient ions o@xmath5",
    ", oh@xmath5 , h@xmath7o@xmath5 , and heh@xmath5 are expected to be proportional to @xmath55 . in fully molecular regions , @xmath56 , of low ionization @xmath57 , competing processes rarely interrupt the sequence of h - atom abstraction reactions so that almost every ionization of hydrogen leads to formation of h@xmath6 , h@xmath2 , oh@xmath5 , h@xmath7o@xmath5 , and h@xmath8o@xmath5 . the time - scales to achieve steady state are very short , @xmath58 year .",
    "the abundances of interstellar molecules can be computed from a system of rate equations for various values of the physical conditions ( density , temperature , ionization rate ) and gas - phase elemental abundances , either in the steady - state limit or as a time - dependent solution .",
    "however , the abundances alone do not characterize observable signatures , because the distributions of the molecules among their quantum states tend to be far out of equilibrium .",
    "the departures from equilibrium will be most extreme for the most reactive molecular ions , because elastic and inelastic collisions that would otherwise thermalize them are typically not faster than the reactive collisions with the main collision partner , h@xmath7 , that destroy them @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the coupled effects of ion chemistry and non - equilibrium excitation with results from a reference model of molecular gas at density @xmath59 @xmath19 exposed to an ionization rate @xmath60  s@xmath11 over a path length @xmath61  cm  @xmath62 pc .",
    "the excitation and transport of spectrum lines are computed through use of the radex program , which can incorporate formation and destruction rates state - by - state for reactive molecules along with all relevant radiative and inelastic collision processes @xcite .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas is assumed to be 150 k , somewhat elevated owing to enhanced heating by cosmic rays .",
    "all line widths are taken to be 9.394 km s@xmath11 .",
    "full details of these calculations will be presented elsewhere . because h@xmath6 has no permanent dipole moment ,",
    "its vibration - rotation and pure rotational spectrum occurs only as weak electric quadrupole transitions . upon birth by ionization of h@xmath7",
    ", h@xmath6 is endowed with high vibrational excitation but it retains the relatively cold rotational distribution of its parent . at gas densities below @xmath63 @xmath19 , excited h@xmath6 decays to the ground state by radiation more rapidly than it is destroyed or excited by collisions . as a result ,",
    "the emitted spectrum in our reference model is directly predictable from the value of the cr exposure , @xmath64 s@xmath11 @xmath31 , and the known quadrupole transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "owing to symmetry - breaking in the last few bound vibration - rotation levels near the dissociation limit , h@xmath6 exhibits a few dipole - allowed radio - frequency transitions @xcite .",
    "these transitions are excited in our model by the small fraction of ionizations that put h@xmath6 into levels @xmath65 of the 1s@xmath66 ground electronic state .",
    "transitions to three barely bound levels @xmath67 of the 2p@xmath68 state occur with high probabilities @xcite that partly compensate for the low populations of the initial states : we predict that these transitions at 17.6 , 52.9 , and 96.4 ghz will appear as weak masers in regions of high cr exposure .",
    "the electronically excited levels also radiate rapidly to 1s@xmath69 in transitions at mm / submm wavelengths .",
    "although these symmetry - breaking transitions will probably be undetectably weak in sources like those considered here , they may become observable in the more extreme environments in active galactic nuclei .",
    "the high excitation of h@xmath6 is partly transferred to h@xmath2 in the next chemical step and h@xmath2 can also be excited by collisions several times during its lifetime .",
    "the distortion - induced rotational transition @xcite of h@xmath2 @xmath70 easily suffers population inversion @xcite , a necessary condition for a maser .",
    "the transition frequency is poorly known ( approximately 217.7 ghz ) , but the line is predicted in our reference model to appear as a weak maser with a peak rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature of 10 mk , an intensity that is detectable with existing radio telescopes .",
    "the intrinsically weak , far - infrared rotational transitions of h@xmath2 are excited mainly by collisions at the kinetic temperature of the gas , while the infrared vibration - rotation transitions of both h@xmath6 and h@xmath2 are excited in the formation process with superthermal intensity distributions . in general",
    ", the rotational line intensities of h@xmath2 will depend upon the local density and temperature ; however , the entire spectrum of h@xmath6 is rather insensitive to these physical conditions .",
    "we calculate explicitly the formation rate of heh@xmath5 by vibrationally excited h@xmath6 and predict the spectrum that results from its initial , superthermal excitation .",
    "the predicted spectra are illustrated in figure [ fig : h2+spectrum ] .",
    "predicted emission spectra of h@xmath6 ( red in online version ) and h@xmath2 ( black online ) for the reference model .",
    "the surface brightness is displayed in jy nsr@xmath11 where 1 jy = @xmath71 w m@xmath72 hz@xmath11 and 1 nsr = @xmath73 steradian of solid angle . in the figure , @xmath74  s@xmath11  @xmath31 is used as a typical value in this context ( see text).,width=377 ]    at infrared wavelengths the strongest lines of h@xmath2 appear between 3 and 4.6 @xmath75 m while h@xmath6 lines of comparable intensity appear between 4 and 6 @xmath75 m .",
    "the strongest vibration - rotation lines of heh@xmath5 in this region are several hundred times weaker . in the far - infrared region ,",
    "the thermally excited lines of h@xmath2 are quite strong while the lines of heh@xmath5 are again considerably weaker . in the far - infrared , thermal emission by interstellar dust particles",
    "will produce continuous radiation with typical surface brightness @xmath76 jy nsr@xmath11 at a wavelength of 100 @xmath75 m ; even so , it appears that the strongest rotational lines of h@xmath2 might be observable if the spectroscopic resolving power is at least 100 ( resolution of 1 @xmath75 m at 100 @xmath75 m wavelength ) . for comparison ,",
    "the weak h@xmath2 feature at 30.725 @xmath75 m has an intensity approximately 1/2 as large as that of the h@xmath7 @xmath77 line at 28.226 @xmath75 m .",
    "we have also calculated the spectra of the oh@xmath78 ions , @xmath79 .",
    "these ions form mainly as a result of reactions of thermalized h@xmath2 or h@xmath5 with oxygen and subsequent reactions with h@xmath7 .",
    "the excess energy ( enthalpies of reactants minus products ) of each reaction will go partly into vibrational and rotational excitation of the product , so that the oh@xmath78 ions will also exhibit superthermal excitation . a predicted signal of enhanced production of oxygen - bearing ions will be strong absorption in rotation - inversion transitions arising in highly metastable states of h@xmath8o@xmath5 at frequencies 1.6 to 1.9 thz . absorption spectroscopy of interstellar h@xmath2 has already suggested enhanced rates of ionization throughout the central molecular zone of the galaxy @xcite and in two locations near the snr ic  443 @xcite .",
    "we predict that emission lines of both h@xmath6 and h@xmath2 will be detectable and that their intensities can be used to measure the cr exposure .",
    "we have calculated the associated cosmic ray ionization rate in interstellar matter near snrs .",
    "while the exact value will depend on the exact density and spectral shape , we expect ionization to be significantly above galactic average . the cosmic ray exposure of the interstellar hydrogen ( ionization rate times gas density integrated over path length ) for the snrs w51c , w28 , w44 , ic443 and w49b is expected to be of the order of @xmath74  s@xmath11  @xmath31 .",
    "this permits the construction of a coupled model of the ion chemistry and the excitation of reactive molecular ions that might serve as specific tracers of cosmic rays near their sources .",
    "predictions are made of the intensities of rotational and vibration - rotation transitions of the reactive ions including the first quantitative prediction of an astronomical spectrum of h@xmath6 .",
    "it appears that superthermally excited emission lines of h@xmath6 and h@xmath2 may be detectable at wavelengths between 3 and 6 @xmath75 m .",
    "strong thermal emission of h@xmath2 may be measurable in the far infrared at 50 to 150 @xmath75 m wavelength .",
    "w49b seems to be an outstanding candidate for the detection , with predicted ionization rate more than 4 orders of magnitude above galactic average .",
    "future measurements by e.g.  herschel and alma provide the opportunity to make observations of ionization signatures in snr / mc systems and analyze their correlation to the gamma - ray emission .",
    "a recent observation suggests an enhanced excitation and abundance of ammonia toward w28 @xcite .",
    "using radex , it is possible to explain the observed spectrum as cr induced with an ionization rate of @xmath80  s@xmath11 , so a factor of @xmath81 above galactic average .",
    "further , h@xmath82 emission observed from the direction of ic443 indicates an enhanced ionization level of @xmath83  s@xmath11 , so a factor of 10 above galactic average @xcite . in the future ,",
    "more observations need to be performed in order to explicitly search for the expected signatures of h@xmath6 and h@xmath2 .",
    "treating the propagation of the crs in detail will allow us to give even more precise predictions of the expected emission regions ."
