    "a very useful way to regularize a quantum field theory is provided by the lattice formulation introduced by wilson @xcite .",
    "( see for example , @xcite for a detailed treatment ) . however , this formulation has difficulty in capturing topological features of a field theory , for example , the topological theta - term in qcd .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate alternative discretisation schemes . in this paper",
    "we describe an alternative scheme which is applicable to antisymmetric tensor field theories including abelian gauge theories and fermion field theory in the khler ",
    "dirac framework @xcite , and which is well - suited for capturing the topological features of such theories .",
    "it is based on developing analogies between the different types of fields and the way they appear in a quantum field theory with a corresponding list of discrete variables and operators .",
    "the method is valid for any arbitrary compact 3-manifold without boundary .",
    "we illustrate the scheme by applying it to the pure abelian chern - simons gauge theory in 3 dimensions , and to a doubled version , the so - called abelian bf gauge theory . in the latter case",
    "the topological features of the theory are completely reproduced by our discretisation scheme , even before taking the continuum limit .",
    "we illustrate this by explicit numerical calculations of the discrete partition function when the spacetime is @xmath0 or is a lens space , l(p,1 ) .",
    "the discretisation scheme involves several ingredients which are not used in the standard wilson lattice formulation .",
    "these include a triangulation of the spacetime ( _ i.e. _ a decomposition into hyper - tetrahedra rather then hyper - cubes ) and a mathematical tool called the whitney map @xcite .",
    "these have previously been used to discretise field theories in @xcite where various convergence results ( e.g. convergence of the discrete action to the continuum action ) were established .",
    "triangulations of spacetime are also used in discretisations of other quantum field theories , for example in quantum gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the thrust of the present work is quite different .",
    "we set up the discretisation in such a way that the geometric structures of the continuum field theory are mirrored by analogous structures in the discrete formulation .",
    "as we will see , this requires a certain doubling of fields . with this doubling the topological features of abelian chern - simons theory",
    "are completely captured by the formulation .",
    "an alternate scheme of discretisation proposed previously in @xcite which does not involve the doubling of fields fails to capture the topological features of the abelian chern - simons theory as we will show numerically in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "a mathematical treatment of this discretisation scheme has been given in @xcite .",
    "a short version of some of the results has been published in @xcite .",
    "our aims in this paper are , firstly , to make the techniques and results of @xcite accessible to a wider audience , and secondly , to demonstrate a practical numerical implementation of the discretisation scheme .",
    "numerical implementations are developed for abelian chern - simons theory defined on the three dimensional sphere , @xmath0 , and on the lens spaces @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our discretisation scheme is the only one which numerically reproduces the exact topological results for abelian chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "the discretisation scheme is described together with a summary of the topological results used to set it up . in section  [ sec3 ] some features of the abelian chern - simons theory on general 3-manifolds are reviewed . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "the discretisation scheme is applied to this theory .",
    "an expression for the partition function of the resulting discrete theory is derived in terms of the data specifying the triangulation of the spacetime . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "the numerical evaluations of the partition functions corresponding to these triangulations are presented . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we summarise our conclusions .",
    "let us start by considering a general quantum field theory defined on an arbitrary manifold m of dimension d. suppose the theory has fields @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and where @xmath6 is a @xmath7-form ( antisymmetric tensor field of degree @xmath7 defined on @xmath8 ) .",
    "the lagrangian for the system involves the fields , the laplacian operator , and possibly ( as for the chern - simon theory ) an antisymmetrized first - order differential operator .    in differential geometric terms",
    ", the theory is constructed using the following objects which are defined on the manifold @xmath8 : @xmath7-forms @xmath6 which are generalised antisymmetric tensor fields , the exterior derivative @xmath9 , the hodge star operator @xmath10 , which is required to define scalar products , and the wedge operator @xmath11 .",
    "we want to construct discrete analogues of these objects .",
    "we begin by summarizing the basic properties of our operators of interest @xcite . on a manifold m of dimension",
    "d , the operations ( @xmath12 ) on p - forms , @xmath13 , satisfy the following :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   @xmath16 .",
    "4 .   @xmath17 .",
    "5 .   @xmath18 , @xmath19 . 6 .",
    "@xmath20 , ( @xmath21 is the adjoint of @xmath22 ) .",
    "the following definitions will also be required    * the laplacian on p - forms @xmath23 . *",
    "the inner product @xmath24 .",
    "a few examples might now be helpful .",
    "firstly , consider qed in 4 dimensions .",
    "the gauge field @xmath25 is a 1-form .",
    "the electromagnetic field is a 2-form given by @xmath26 .",
    "the action for the gauge field in qed is given by @xmath27 thus s involves the operators * , d and the wedge product .",
    "similarly for abelian chern - simons theory the gauge field @xmath28 and electromagnetic field @xmath26 are 1-forms and 2-forms respectively , as for qed .",
    "the action for the theory is given by @xmath29 where the spacetime m is 3-dimensional .",
    "note that in both cases we can think of the action @xmath30 as a quadratic functional of the gauge field @xmath28 .",
    "we would like to discretise the fields of @xmath6 , the inner product @xmath31 , and the operators @xmath32 such that discrete analogues of their continuum interrelationships hold . to do this",
    "it is necessary to first introduce a few basic ideas of discretisation .",
    "we start by discretising the manifold @xmath8 .",
    "this involves replacing @xmath8 by a collection of discrete objects , known as simplices , glued together .",
    "we need a few definitions @xcite .",
    "firstly , for @xmath33 , a @xmath7-simplex @xmath34 $ ] is defined to be the convex hull in some euclidean space @xmath35 of a set of @xmath36 points @xmath37 . here",
    "the vertices @xmath38 are required to span a @xmath7-dimensional space .",
    "this requirement will hold so long as the equations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 admit only the trivial solution @xmath41 for @xmath42 for @xmath43 real .",
    "a few examples might clarify the geometry .",
    "consider @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "this is a point or 0-simplex .",
    "next @xmath45 $ ] is a line segment or 1-simplex .",
    "an orientation can be assigned by the ordering of the vertices , in which case @xmath46 $ ] for example .",
    "the faces of a 1-simplex are its vertices @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] which are 0-simplices .",
    "@xmath49 $ ] is a triangle or 2-simplex .",
    "we note that an even permutation of the vertices has the same orientation as @xmath50 while an odd permutation reverses it and will be written as @xmath51 .",
    "the faces of a 2-simplex are its edges @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] , and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "finally , @xmath55 $ ] is a tetrahedron or 3-simplex .",
    "its faces are the four triangles @xmath56 , [ v_0,v_2,v_3 ] , [ v_0,v_1,v_3]$ ] and @xmath57 $ ] which bound it .",
    "an important feature of our discretisation scheme is that the original simplices are subdivided by using simplex barycentres .",
    "geometrically the _ barycentre _ of a @xmath7-simplex , @xmath58 , is the point which represents its `` center of mass '' .",
    "we denote the barycentre of @xmath59 $ ] as the point @xmath60 as an example , the barycentre of @xmath61 $ ] is the midpoint of the line segment which joins the vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we can now describe a particular way that a given manifold @xmath8 can be discretised .",
    "let @xmath64 be a collection of simplices @xmath65 , @xmath66 , with the property that the faces of the simplices which belong to @xmath64 also belong to it . the elements of @xmath64 glued together in the following way is known as a simplicial complex@xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath67 if @xmath68 , @xmath69 have no common face .",
    "@xmath70 if @xmath68 , @xmath69 have precisely one face in common , along which they are glued together .",
    "+    in many cases of interest(including all 3-manifolds and all differentiable manifolds @xcite ) , @xmath8 can be replaced by a complex @xmath71 which it is topologically equivalent to .",
    "@xmath71 is then said to be a triangulation of @xmath8(note this triangulation is not unique ) . in this way of discretising m ,",
    "the building blocks are zero , one , @xmath72 , d - dimensional objects , all of which are simplices e.g.generalised oriented tetrahedra .",
    "we now observe that the same manifold can be discretised in many different ways .",
    "in the discretisation described , we used simplices .",
    "we could just as well have used generalised oriented cubes .",
    "there is another method of discretising a manifold which is the dual of the simplicial discretisation just described .",
    "it associates with a simplicial complex @xmath71 a dual complex @xmath73 .",
    "we proceed to describe this construction .",
    "we will see that the basic objects of the dual complex @xmath73 are again zero , one , two , @xmath72 , d dimensional objects , but this time they are no longer simplices .",
    "we illustrate the method by considering a manifold , @xmath8 , which is a disc .",
    "this is a manifold with a boundary .",
    "we triangulate this by the simplicial complex , @xmath71 , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .     of a disc .",
    "]    now consider the barycentres of the building blocks of the simplicial complex @xmath71 .",
    "we have the following list shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".elements of the simplicial complex @xmath71 and their barycentres . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the method of discretisation introduced works extremely well .",
    "the main point of the method is to construct discrete analogues for the set @xmath74 .",
    "previous work in the direction has neglected the hodge star operator , * @xcite .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that the hodge star operator plays a vital role in the construction of topological invariant objects from field theory .",
    "we were able to construct an expression for the partition function which is correct even as far as overall normalisation is concerned .",
    "mathematically the equivalence between the ray - singer torsion and the combinatorial torsion of reidemeister was proved independently in 1976 by cheeger @xcite and mller @xcite .",
    "it is nice to see the result emerge in a direct manner by a formal process of discretisation . on the way we also had to double the original system so that k , the triangulation , and @xmath73 , its dual , are both present .",
    "if this doubling and the reason for it are overlooked , then the topological information present in the discretisation is lost , as our numerical results demonstrated .",
    "it is clear that the geometry motivated discretisation method introduced is very general and that it can be used to analyse a wide variety of physical systems . in the approach",
    "outlined we have captured topological features . in applications capturing geometrical features of a problem are also very important .",
    "we are currently investigating this aspect of our approach .",
    "a limitation of the method is that there is no simple generalisation to deal with non - abelian theories .",
    "the discrete analogies of @xmath22 , @xmath75 were linear : there is no natural discrete analogue of @xmath76 , with @xmath28 a lie algebra valued one form .",
