    "measurements of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and its evolution provide important constraints on theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is currently believed that galaxies formed hierarchically from the merger of sub - clumps , with the peak of star formation rate occurring around redshifts @xmath54 , eg . @xcite . since then , galaxies are thought to have evolved mostly passively as their stellar populations age , with occasional activity triggered by interactions with other galaxies .",
    "significant evolution in the lf has been measured since redshift @xmath6 ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but most existing galaxy samples have been too small to directly constrain evolution at more recent epochs . by combining three different redshift surveys , @xcite was able to demonstrate that the amplitude of the lf increases by a factor @xmath0 in the redshift range @xmath7 .",
    "he also found evidence for an increase in the amplitude of the lf to @xmath80.2 , although the strength of this low - redshift evolution was poorly constrained .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provides an ideal sample with which to measure galaxy evolution at low redshifts .",
    "a recent determination of the lf at redshift @xmath9 @xcite , allowing for galaxy evolution , showed that the typical @xmath10-band galaxy luminosity brightens by @xmath11 mag per unit redshift . here",
    "we further investigate evolution in the @xmath10-band lf of sdss galaxies .",
    "we describe the data sample in section  [ sec : data ] and estimate the lf in four redshift slices in section  [ sec : lf ] .",
    "the effects of galaxy evolution are investigated in an alternative way in section  [ sec : dens ] , where we estimate the radial density of galaxies .",
    "comparisons with observed number - magnitude counts are made in section  [ sec : counts ] and we conclude in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "we use galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 ( dr1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the sdss is performing five band ccd imaging over an area @xmath12 square degrees ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a multifibre spectrograph is measuring spectra and redshifts for a subset of sources detected in the imaging data ; here we consider only galaxies in the main flux - limited sample @xcite .",
    "a technical summary of the survey is given in @xcite and a description of sdss photometric and spectroscopic parameters may be found in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude limit of the main galaxy survey has been set at an extinction - corrected @xcite @xmath10-band petrosian magnitude @xmath13 .",
    "this magnitude limit was chosen as test year data demonstrated that it corresponds closely to the desired target density of 90 objects per square degree , see @xcite for full details of the target selection algorithm .",
    "however , a small amount of early data included in dr1 was taken when the magnitude limit was set at @xmath14 , and so we adopt this brighter magnitude limit here .",
    "we thus select galaxies from the dr1 catalogue with extinction - corrected @xmath10-band petrosian magnitude @xmath14 and with one or more of the ` target_galaxy ` , ` target_galaxy_big ` or ` target_galaxy_bright_core ` bits set in the primtarget bit mask ; see @xcite for a description of these target classifications .",
    "these selection criteria yield a sample of 162,989 target galaxies over 2099 square degrees . of these target galaxies ,",
    "91,921 have had a spectrum observed and 91,611 have a redshift measured with a confidence of 80% or higher .",
    "the sampling rate for our sample , defined as the number of galaxies with reliable redshifts divided by the number of target galaxies , is thus @xmath15 .",
    "this low sampling rate is simply due to the fact that sdss spectroscopic observations lag imaging observations ; the effective spectroscopic area is 1360 square degrees .",
    "the fraction of targets observed spectroscopically is further reduced by limitations on the placement of spectroscopic fibres @xcite .",
    "the fraction of spectra yielding reliable redshifts is more than 99.6% , with no discernible dependence on apparent magnitude . whilst we naturally can not demonstrate that spectroscopic success rate is independent of redshift , the fraction of galaxies without reliable redshifts is only 0.4% , and so spectroscopic incompleteness will have a negligible effect on estimates of galaxy evolution .",
    "heliocentric velocities are converted to the galactocentric frame using @xmath16 . unless otherwise stated , we assume a hubble constant of @xmath17 km / s / mpc and an @xmath18 cosmology in calculating distances , comoving volumes and luminosities .    when estimating intrinsic galaxy luminosities , it is necessary to correct for the fact that a fixed observed passband corresponds to a different range of wavelengths in the rest frames of galaxies at different redshifts , the so - called @xmath3-correction .",
    "the @xmath3-correction depends on the passband used , the redshift of the galaxy and its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "here we use ` kcorrect v3_1b ` @xcite in order to estimate and apply these corrections . briefly , this code estimates an sed for each galaxy by finding the non - negative , linear combination of three template spectra that gives the best - fit to the five sdss magnitudes of that galaxy . rather than estimating luminosities in the rest - frame of each galaxy , we use ` kcorrect ` to estimate luminosities in a passband blue - shifted by @xmath9",
    ". following @xcite we denote the @xmath10-band in this frame as @xmath19 .",
    "the advantage of this choice of restframe is that galaxies at redshift @xmath9 ( close to the mean for the sdss main galaxy sample ) have @xmath3-corrections independent of galaxy type , and these corrections are on average smaller in amplitude than @xmath3-corrections at redshift zero .",
    "we estimate the lf using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sty ) parametric maximum likelihood method and the stepwise maximum likelihood ( swml ) method of ( * ? ? ? * eep ) .",
    "these estimators are unbiased by density inhomogeneities and have well - defined error properties .",
    "both methods assume that @xmath20 has a universal form , _",
    "i.e. _ the number density of galaxies is separable into a function of luminosity times a function of position : @xmath21 . using these estimators ,",
    "the shape of @xmath20 is determined independently of its normalization .",
    "the probability of seeing a galaxy of luminosity @xmath22 at redshift @xmath23 in a flux - limited catalogue is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the minimum and maximum luminosities observable at redshift @xmath23 in a flux limited sample .",
    "in the sty method , the likelihood @xmath27 ( where the product extends over all galaxies in the sample ) is maximized with respect to a set of parameters describing the function @xmath20 .",
    "for example , if we assume that @xmath20 is described by a @xcite function , @xmath28 we maximize the likelihood with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "errors in the schechter parameters are estimated by the jackknife method , whereby we subdivide the galaxies into 20 roughly equal sub - samples and estimate the schechter parameters omitting each sub - sample in turn . the variance in parameter @xmath31",
    "is then given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of sub - samples and @xmath34 is the mean of @xmath31 .",
    "for the highest redshift sub - sample considered here , @xmath35 , only galaxies more luminous than @xmath36 make it into the sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "we thus have only a range of about two magnitudes over which to fit the schechter function .",
    "consequently , the accuracy with which the schechter parameters can be determined is limited , particularly the value of the faint - end slope @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore also estimate the luminosity function using the swml method of eep in which @xmath20 is parameterized as a set of numbers @xmath37 in equally spaced magnitude bins . the likelihood @xmath38 is maximized with respect to @xmath37 applying constraints as described in eep . also following eep , errors on the @xmath37",
    "are estimated from the information matrix .",
    "we use the following estimator of the space density @xmath39 of galaxies : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the sampling rate , @xmath42 the galaxy selection function and @xmath43 a weighting function .",
    "the selection function for galaxies with luminosities @xmath44 to @xmath45 is @xmath46 note that the integration limits in the numerator depend on the @xmath3-correction . in this case , we estimate the @xmath3-correction using an sed created from the mean template coefficients of all galaxies in the sample .",
    "we adopt the weighting function @xmath47 } ,   \\quad j_3(r_c ) = \\int_0^{r_c } r^2 \\xi(r ) dr \\label{eqn : weight}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the two point galaxy correlation function .",
    "provided @xmath49 converges on a scale @xmath50 much smaller than the depth of the survey , then the weighting scheme ( eq .  [ eqn : weight ] ) minimizes the variance in the estimate of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath52 weight galaxies at high redshift more highly ; we adopt @xmath53 .",
    "this value comes from integrating the two - point galaxy correlation function of @xcite , @xmath54 , to @xmath55 ; at larger separations the value of @xmath52 becomes uncertain .",
    "however , the results are not too sensitive to the value of @xmath52 , the estimated density decreasing by 7% if @xmath52 is halved .",
    "when normalizing the non - parametric swml estimate , the integrals in ( [ eqn : selfn ] ) are replaced by sums over magnitude bins , with appropriate weighting of partial bins in the numerator .",
    "we first estimate the luminosity function for all 90,275 galaxies in the sdss dr1 with redshifts greater than 0.001 and with absolute magnitudes in the @xmath19 band between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the first indication of significant evolution in this sample comes from the skewed distribution of the @xcite @xmath58 statistic ( figure  [ fig : vvmax ] ) .",
    "we find a mean @xmath59 , whereas one would expect @xmath60 for a homogeneous distribution of 90,275 galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function of this full sample is shown in figure  [ fig : lf ] . a schechter function with parameters",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 provides good agreement with the non - parametric swml estimator except for the bright end , @xmath64 , where we see in the swml estimate a higher density of galaxies than predicted by the schechter function .",
    "this bright - end excess can be explained by evolution of the lf : the most luminous ( rare ) galaxies are likely to be seen at high redshift and , as we shall see below , high - redshift galaxies have an enhanced luminosity or density relative to low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the schechter function fit will be mostly constrained by galaxies at an intermediate redshift ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "additionally , it is possible that some galaxies with extreme luminosities , @xmath66 , may have incorrectly measured fluxes  see below .",
    "note that any evolution in the luminosity function will render invalid our assumption that the number density of galaxies can be separated into a function of luminosity times a function of position . in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the lf , one needs to allow for evolution .",
    "@xcite have already shown that the @xmath10-band luminosity function of galaxies in the sdss can be described by a schechter function whose characteristic luminosity @xmath30 brightens by @xmath11 magnitudes per unit redshift . here",
    "we investigate the evolution of the galaxy lf in an alternative way , simply by subdividing the sample into slices in redshift .",

    "the points with error bars show the swml estimates , the lines show the schechter function fits .",
    "note that one can not fairly compare the shapes of the schechter fits from this figure , since the different redshift slices contain galaxies covering a different range of absolute magnitudes .",
    "in particular , the faint end slope of the highest redshift slice is very poorly constrained , since there are no galaxies fainter than @xmath36 in this subsample . if analysis of the intermediate @xmath71@xmath72 redshift slice is limited to @xmath73 , then the estimated faint - end slope changes from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "the schechter fits in figure  [ fig : lfevol ] are thus included for illustrative purposes only , and we deliberately do not quote the schechter parameters .    the swml data point for the lowest redshift slice at @xmath76 lies significantly above the schechter fit .",
    "this is almost certainly due to errors in the photometry of the half - dozen or so objects in this bin .",
    "of the ten apparently most luminous objects in the @xmath77 slice ( @xmath78 ) , all have the ` edge ` or ` cosmic_ray ` flag set .",
    "low redshift , luminous galaxies have much larger fluxes and apparent sizes than most galaxies , and hence are more susceptible to their measured fluxes being affected by cosmic ray hits or by lying near the edge of a ccd chip .    despite the uncertainties in the _ shape _ of the lf in the redshift slices , there is clear evolution in the _ amplitude _ of the lf , in the sense of an increasing amplitude ( vertical shift ) and/or luminosity ( horizontal shift ) with redshift .",
    "the estimated number densities of galaxies in the range @xmath79 , obtained by applying ( [ eqn : nbar ] ) to the non - parametric lf for each redshift slice , are given in table  [ tab : dens ] .",
    "for comparison , we also show the galaxy density inferred from the evolving parametric lf of @xcite .",
    "their fit gives schechter parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 in the @xmath19 frame , with characteristic magnitude @xmath84 evolving as @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "we ignore the negligibly small number density evolution in their fit and assume that the error in number density is dominated by the @xmath87 uncertainty in @xmath88 .",
    "our density estimates agree within @xmath89 for the three lower redshift slices , but the density estimate for the highest redshift slice is @xmath90 larger than that inferred from the blanton et al . model .",
    "the results presented here , and those of @xcite , are entirely consistent , since the blanton et al .",
    "parametric model assumed linear evolution of the characteristic magnitude @xmath84 with redshift .",
    "less than 6% of the galaxies in the full ( @xmath91 ) sample are at @xmath35 , and so the blanton et al .",
    "analysis would have been insensitive to rapid evolution at these redshifts .    in the following section ,",
    "we investigate evolution in the radial density of galaxies in narrower redshift bins .",
    "note that the density estimator we use assumes a non - evolving luminosity function , so any effect found can equally well be ascribed to number or luminosity evolution .",
    "just as the maximum - likelihood estimate of the luminosity function @xmath20 is independent of inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution , one can also estimate the radial density @xmath92 independently of the assumed luminosity function by maximizing the likelihood @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the limiting redshifts at which a galaxy of luminosity @xmath22 would still be included in the survey .",
    "we fit @xmath92 by an arbitrary step function , using a variant of the swml estimator @xcite . as in the maximum - likelihood estimate of @xmath20 , overall normalization",
    "is lost and so we have applied the constraint @xmath96 where @xmath42 is the selection function ( [ eqn : selfn ] ) and @xmath43 is the weighting function ( [ eqn : weight ] ) .",
    "this constraint is also used for the error estimates ( cf .",
    "eep ) .",
    "our estimate of @xmath92 is plotted separately for the northern and southern galactic hemispheres in figure  [ fig : mldenns ] .",
    "we see a gentle increase in @xmath92 out to @xmath97 , with a steeper increase to @xmath98 .",
    "this estimate of radial density is independent of the galaxy luminosity function only insofar as there is no correlation between redshift and luminosity .",
    "the observed increase in radial density could thus either reflect an increase in the number density of galaxies at higher redshift ( whether due to number density evolution or the existence of a large local `` hole '' ) , and/or an increase in luminosity with redshift .",
    "if there is a large local underdensity , it is extremely unlikely that we happen to lie exactly at the centre of it , and so the consistent radial dependence of density in the northern and southern hemispheres provides strong evidence against the local hole hypothesis .",
    "we have also checked the dependence of the estimated radial density on the assumed cosmological model and our method of applying @xmath3-corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig : mldentest ] shows estimated radial density for the full sample ( north plus south ) for the same assumed cosmology and @xmath3-correction as figure  [ fig : mldenns ] , along with the estimate separately assuming a flat , @xmath99 cosmology , and @xmath3-correcting the @xmath10-band galaxy magnitudes to redshift zero instead of redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the accelerated expansion in the @xmath100-dominated cosmology gives rise to a larger density at high redshift compared with the @xmath99 cosmology .",
    "even though the increase in radial density with redshift is rather less if one assumes a @xmath99 cosmology , particularly for @xmath101 , the increase in density is still significant .",
    "the estimated radial density is entirely consistent whether one @xmath3-corrects galaxy magnitudes to the @xmath102 or @xmath19 bands , suggesting that any errors in the @xmath3-correction have a negligible effect on the estimated densities .",
    ".results of a @xmath103 test for uniform density within two redshift ranges ( low-@xmath104 : 00.15 and high-@xmath104 : 0.150.3 ) for the dr1 sample and for clustered and random simulated catalogues . in each case",
    "there are 14 degrees of freedom . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have tested the significance of the radial density evolution over the redshift ranges 00.15 and 0.150.3 . in the lower redshift range ,",
    "evolution is small but so are the error bars . in the higher redshift range ,",
    "where evolution is more pronounced , the error bars are much larger . for each redshift range , we calculate the mean radial density and perform a @xmath103 test of the null hypothesis that all bins have this mean density .",
    "we apply the same test to two non - evolving , simulated catalogues .",
    "the first consists of a random distribution of galaxies with comparable galaxy numbers and lf to dr1 .",
    "the second consists of a @xcite hierarchical simulation with comparable galaxy numbers , lf , clustering and sky coverage to dr1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath103 statistics are given in table  [ tab : chi2 ] ; in each case there are 14 degrees of freedom ( 15 data points minus one free parameter : the mean density ) .    for the random simulation ,",
    "the @xmath103 values are consistent with the uniform density null hypothesis .    for the clustered simulation , the @xmath103 values are inconsistent with uniform density , particularly in the low-@xmath104 range .",
    "this is to be expected given the presence of large scale structure in the simulated galaxy distribution .",
    "the biggest contribution to @xmath103 comes from the first three radial bins ( @xmath105 ) where density fluctuations are particularly pronounced since clustering is not smeared out by peculiar velocities in these simulations .    the dr1 sample yields @xmath103 values marginally larger than the clustered simulation in the low-@xmath104 range , and significantly larger than the clustered simulation in the high-@xmath104 range .",
    "deviation from a non - evolving @xmath92 is thus clearly very significant in the redshift range 0.150.30 but only marginally significant in the redshift range 00.15 .",
    "the open symbols in figure [ fig : mldentest ] show the densities of luminous galaxies inferred when normalizing the luminosity function in four redshift slices ( table  [ tab : dens ] ) , rescaled to have unit mean density .",
    "the horizontal bars attached to these symbols denote the redshift range ( the symbol is centred on the mean redshift in each bin , rather than at the centre of each bin ) and the vertical bars denote the estimated error in density .",
    "the agreement between these two completely independent methods of estimating radial density is striking : the apparent increase in estimated radial density with redshift can be explained entirely by evolution of the galaxy luminosity function , with no need for a local underdensity .",
    "in this section we explore the effect of galaxy evolution , as reflected in our estimate of radial density , on counts of galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "in particular , galaxy number counts in the apm galaxy survey @xcite are steeper than one would expect unless there is significant evolution of galaxies at low redshift .",
    "can the evolution seen here at @xmath4 explain the steep apm counts ?",

    "these predicted counts are plotted in figure  [ fig : counts ] for the non - evolving lf of section [ sec : resfull ] with @xmath110 ( continuous line ) and for the same lf but with @xmath92 as estimated for the full sample in section  [ sec : dens ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "we make the conservative assumption when evaluating ( [ eqn : counts ] ) that density does not evolve further beyond a redshift of 0.3 , so that @xmath111 for @xmath112 .    for comparison ,",
    "the open circles show number counts measured in the @xmath113 passband from the apm galaxy survey @xcite , where we have made a very rough correction to the @xmath10-passband using @xmath114 .",
    "the evolving model derived from sdss data is in remarkable agreement with the apm counts considering the different passbands used and areas of sky observed . if the steep apm counts are due to a local underdensity , then a very similar underdensity exists in sdss galaxy counts which come predominantly from the northern sky .",
    "observed galaxy number counts from the sdss early data release @xcite are shown as diamonds ( we have summed the yasuda et al .",
    "counts in the northern and southern equatorial stripes ) .",
    "these counts are significantly shallower than the apm counts and are consistent in shape with no galaxy evolution . however , these counts come from an area of only 440 square degrees and so are susceptible to fluctuations from large scale structure .",
    "we have therefore also estimated galaxy number counts from the 2099 square degrees of sdss dr1 .",
    "galaxies are selected from the dr1 database according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "none of the saturated , blended , bright or edge bits be set in the @xmath10-band photoflags .",
    "the object be classified as a galaxy in at least two of the @xmath115 , @xmath10 and @xmath116 bands .",
    "these counts are shown as triangles in figure  [ fig : counts ] . while not quite as steep as the apm counts , they still lie closer to the evolving lf model than to the non - evolving model .",
    "rapid evolution of the luminosity and/or density of the galaxy population at redshifts @xmath4 thus provides a natural explanation for the observed radial density of sdss galaxies and steep number counts of apm and dr1 galaxies .",
    "we have presented evidence for significant evolution in the luminosity function of @xmath10-band selected galaxies in the sdss dr1 at redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "this evolution gives rise to a factor @xmath117 increase in inferred galaxy density between redshifts 0 and 0.3 , in agreement with earlier findings from @xcite and @xcite . folding this evolution into predictions for galaxy number counts gives a remarkably good match to the slope of number counts observed in the apm galaxy survey and in dr1 itself .",
    "the aim of this short paper has simply been to demonstrate that the luminosity function of galaxies has evolved significantly at recent epochs , since @xmath4 , and that such evolution is sufficient to explain the steepness of the observed number - magnitude counts of apm galaxies , without the need to invoke a local underdensity or a magnitude scale error .",
    "note that these results do not preclude the existence of significant density fluctuations in the local universe on very large scales .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently used galaxies in the 2 micron all sky survey to indicate the presence of a region in the southern galactic hemisphere @xmath118 in extent with a mean underdensity @xmath119 .",
    "this underdensity alone , however , is insufficient to explain the steepness of the apm counts .",
    "we have shown that evolution of the galaxy lf , possibly in combination with large density fluctuations , can explain the steep counts .    here",
    "we have not attempted to investigate the type of evolution that is occurring : the possibilities include any combination of luminosity evolution , density evolution and change in shape of the galaxy lf .",
