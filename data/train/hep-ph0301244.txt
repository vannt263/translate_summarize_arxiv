    "the discovery of the higgs boson is one of the main goals of searches at the present and next hadronic colliders , the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the standard , non - diffractive production mechanisms are being studied extensively .",
    "the main decay modes of a low - mass higgs boson are @xmath0-quark pairs and @xmath1-leptons , which are difficult to extract from the standard model background processes .",
    "a promising channel is the @xmath2 decay mode ; however , due to the small branching fraction ( about 10@xmath3 ) , a luminosity of the order of 50 fb@xmath4 is needed to establish the existence of the higgs boson in the mass range below 135 gev .",
    "it is thus important to investigate other , complementary ways to produce and detect the higgs boson in this mass range .",
    "one promising production mode , the _ exclusive _ double diffractive production , was proposed some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the higgs boson is diffractively produced in the central region resulting in a final state composed of the two protons scattered at very small angles and detected in the roman pot detectors , the decay products of the higgs boson in the main detector , and nothing else .",
    "it is thus a very clean signal .",
    "the kinematic constraints coming from the proton detection in the roman pot detectors allow a very precise determination of the higgs boson mass @xcite , hence improving the signal to background ratio .",
    "contrary to non - diffractive production , the main higgs boson decay modes , like @xmath5 or @xmath6 are thus promising channels .",
    "however , the exclusive cross - sections may be very low , and thus put strong limitations to the potentialities of double diffractive production .",
    "recently , we have studied the possibility of producing the higgs boson together with other particles , _",
    "i.e. _ _ inclusive _ diffractive production @xcite .",
    "the expected cross - sections are increased compared to exclusive production , and the model can be  calibrated \" using the diffractive dijet production measured by the cdf collaboration at tevatron run i @xcite .",
    "the experimental result , and in particular the dijet mass fraction spectrum , shows that hadronic activity in the central region ( coming from hard qcd radiation , and from soft pomeron remnants ) needs to be accounted for , in order to describe these data .",
    "we have proposed a model for double diffractive production of heavy `` objects '' , based on a non - factorizable pomeron model and able to describe the observed features of dijet production data in a qualitative way .",
    "normalizing our raw predictions to the cdf measurement allows to make quantitative predictions for the tevatron and the lhc , given specific assumptions for the model parameters .",
    "we have also shown @xcite that it is possible to reconstruct precisely the mass of the higgs boson if both protons in the final state can be detected with roman pot detectors and if the pomeron remnants can be measured in the forward region with sufficient resolution .    at the tevatron collider ,",
    "the higgs boson production cross - section is severely limited by the small available phase space . at the lhc ,",
    "since the beam energy is much higher , diffractive higgs boson production has larger cross - section , and might thus be an interesting channel , as we shall discuss further on . on the other hand , even if double diffractive higgs boson production at the tevatron is probably too small by itself , it is however possible to verify and constrain models of double diffraction at the tevatron run ii , through the study of difermion production .    in this paper , we wish to provide an extensive study of our model , including predictions for dijet , diphoton and dilepton production and their ratios for both the tevatron run ii and the lhc .",
    "we will discuss possible values of its characteristic parameters , and propose means to discriminate between the existing models at the tevatron . in turn , this study will help to formulate more precise predictions for double diffractive higgs boson production at the lhc in the near future .",
    "the plan of our study is the following . in section [ sectii ]",
    ", we will recall and discuss the original exclusive model of bialas and landshoff @xcite , and our extension to inclusive production . in section [ modpred ] predictions",
    "are given for dijet , diphoton , dilepton and higgs boson cross - sections .",
    "dijet results for the tevatron run i , using a fast simulation of detector effects , are in good agreement with available data and are used to normalize our predictions .",
    "a discussion of pomeron remnants and their possible detection is also given . in section [ parameter ] ,",
    "ways to verify our model and determine its parameters using tevatron data are proposed .",
    "the possibility of distinguishing our model from the existing models of double diffraction is discussed in section [ sectv ] .",
    "section [ sectvi ] summarizes the interest of diffractive higgs boson production compared to standard production . finally , section [ sectvii ] gives conclusions and an outlook on the promising future studies on hard diffraction production at the tevatron and the lhc",
    "let us first introduce the original model of @xcite describing exclusive higgs boson and @xmath7 production in double diffractive production ( noted dpe ) .",
    "] in the following ) .",
    "this process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ diag ] , `` exclusive '' case .    in @xcite ,",
    "the diffractive mechanism is based on two - gluon exchange between the two incoming protons .",
    "the soft pomeron is seen as a pair of gluons non - perturbatively coupled to the proton .",
    "one of the gluons is then coupled perturbatively to the hard process ( either the higgs boson , or the @xmath7 pair , see fig .  [ diag ] ) , while the other one plays the rle of a soft screening of color , allowing for diffraction to occur .",
    "this soft character requires the phenomenological introduction of a distinctive non - perturbative gluon propagator @xcite whose parameters are constrained by the description of total cross - sections using the same formalism .",
    "the hard gluons , carrying all remaining momentum ( @xmath8 ) , fuse to produce the heavy object ( higgs boson and diquarks in the original model ) .",
    "the corresponding cross - sections for @xmath9 and higgs boson production read :    @xmath10    the variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively denote the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons and quarks , @xmath13 are the proton fractional momentum losses are given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and restricted to be smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "this value for @xmath17 comes from the usual cut on rapidity gap to be @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the quark rapidities .",
    "@xmath20 is the gluon - initiated higgs boson production cross - section while @xmath21 is the hard @xmath7 production cross - section in the exclusive case .",
    "indeed , in this exclusive process submitted to the @xmath22 constraint @xcite ( a helicity selection rule for the production of a scalar system from the vacuum channel ) , the @xmath7 differential cross - section writes are normalized to the usual @xmath23 expressions through @xmath24 , apart from normalizations included in @xmath25 : @xmath26    in the model , the non - perturbative input is naturally related to the soft pomeron trajectory taken from the standard donnachie - landshoff parametrization @xcite , namely @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are other parameters to be fixed , coming from the non - perturbative gluon propagators .",
    "phenomenological contraints are obtained from the physical values of the total cross - sections , leading to four unknown parameters in formula ( [ exclusif ] ) , namely the normalizations @xmath30 and the slopes in momentum transfer @xmath31 at this point of our study , the slopes @xmath32 are kept as in the original papers @xcite .    the problem of the normalization constants @xmath30 requires more care , since the evaluation of cross - sections is the main subject of the paper .",
    "all constants of the problem ( non - perturbative proton - gluon coupling , normalization of the non - perturbative gluon propagators , color factors , perturbative higgs boson and @xmath7 production vertices ) are contained in the normalizations @xmath25 and @xmath33 .",
    "the non - perturbative factors are poorly determined by the current data , implying large uncertainties on production cross - section predictions . in particular , even if every other parameter is fixed , the non - perturbative proton - gluon coupling @xmath34 remains undetermined and is arbitrarily fixed to @xmath35 in the original publications @xcite . however , and it is an important aspect of our model studies , the ratio @xmath36 is well defined , and independent of everything else than the color structure of the process .",
    "this means that the _ ratio _ of higgs boson to diquark production is fixed by this factor .",
    "given the expressions of @xmath33 and @xmath25 @xcite , one finds : @xmath37 where enter only in ( [ ratio ] ) the fermi constant @xmath38 , and the ratio of color factors to produce either a color singlet @xmath7 or the scalar higgs boson in the non - factorizable pomeron model ( see for details , the second reference of @xcite ) .",
    "this feature will remain valid in our model of inclusive production , suggesting that the known , large cross - section dijet production process can be used to calibrate higgs boson production .    also note that , as can be seen in ( [ exc ] ) , the exclusive production rate for a given quark flavour is proportional to its mass squared , so that light quark production is expected to be negligible , reflecting in another way the @xmath22 constraint @xcite .",
    "the inclusive mechanism is described in the third graph of fig .",
    "the idea is to take into account that a pomeron is a composite system , made itself from quarks and gluons . in our model , we thus apply the concept of pomeron structure functions to compute the inclusive diffractive higgs boson cross - section .",
    "the h1 measurement of the diffractive structure function @xcite and the corresponding quark and gluon densities are used for this purpose .",
    "this implies the existence of pomeron remnants and qcd radiation , as is the case for the proton .",
    "this assumption comes from _ qcd factorisation _ of hard processes .",
    "however , and this is also an important issue , we do not assume _ regge factorisation _ at the proton vertices , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not use the h1 pomeron flux factors in the proton or antiproton .",
    "regge factorisation is known to be violated between hera and the tevatron .",
    "moreover , we want to use the same physical idea as in the exclusive model @xcite , namely that a non perturbative gluon exchange describes the soft interaction between the incident particles , as in fig .",
    "[ diag ] . in practice",
    ", the regge factorisation breaking appears in three ways in our model :    * i ) * we keep as in the original model of ref @xcite the soft pomeron trajectory with an intercept value of 1.08 .",
    "* ii ) * we normalize our predictions to the cdf run i measurements , allowing for factorisation breaking of the pomeron flux factors in the normalisation between the hera and hadron colliders .",
    "* iii ) * the color factor ( [ ratio ] ) derives from the non - factorizable character of the model , since it stems from the gluon exchange between the incident hadrons .",
    "we will see later the difference between this and the factorizable case .",
    "the formulae for the inclusive production processes considered here follow .",
    "we have , for dijet production , considering only the dominant gluon - initiated hard processes : @xmath39    and for higgs boson production :    @xmath40    for the two following processes , the quark - initiated contribution can not be ignored .",
    "we have , for dilepton production :    @xmath41    and for diphoton production :    @xmath42    in the above , @xmath43 are the pomeron s momentum fractions carried by the gluons or quarks involved in the hard process , and the @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) are the pomeron gluon ( resp .",
    "quark ) energy densities , @xmath46 the parton density multiplied by @xmath47 .",
    "we use as parametrizations of the pomeron structure functions the fits to the diffractive hera data performed in @xcite . the dijet cross - section ) are corrected for a factor @xmath48 error coming from a known misprint in the normalization of @xmath49 in @xcite . ]",
    "is now ( summing over quark flavours @xmath50 , and now including the contribution from gluon jets ) :    @xmath51    to be compared with ( [ exc ] ) .",
    "the above formulae are derived using @xcite , and the dilepton and diphoton cross - sections are taken from @xcite .",
    "the expressions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 in terms of the mandelstam variables are recalled in the appendix .    in the inclusive case ,",
    "contrary to the exclusive case , dijet production is flavour democratic and thus the @xmath54 in ( [ inclusif ] ) extends over all flavors except for the too massive top quark , due to kinematics .",
    "note that the non perturbative parameters are kept the same as in the exclusive case .",
    "indeed , the expressions ( [ exclusif ] ) can be recovered in the limit @xmath55 , and substituting back equation ( [ exc ] ) instead of ( [ inclusif ] ) for the hard cross - section , which restricts to the @xmath56 component of the @xmath7 cross - section and reintroduces the flavor mass hierarchy .",
    "the normalization of @xmath44 is not determined by the hera data ( since it is mixed with the flux factors ) but is fixed in the model in order to lead to the same result for the energy - momentum sum rule as for the exclusive case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the comparison with the observed dijet production rates will give the correct order of magnitude for the inclusive model , while the exclusive one leads to too important rates , as discussed in the next section .",
    "note that the normalization cancels in the ratio @xmath57 , with the same value as in the exclusive case , see [ ratio ] .",
    "the cdf measurement of double diffractive dijet production @xcite is used as a verification of the validity of our approach ( namely concerning the inclusive picture we consider , and the application of structure functions measured in electron - proton collisions in our context ) .",
    "once the model validity tested , the measured cross - section will allow us to fix ( within experimental errors ) the absolute normalization of the cross - sections .    in the cdf measurement , an outgoing antiproton",
    "is measured on one side of the detector , and the dpe nature of the events is ensured by requiring a rapidity gap on the opposite side .",
    "the selection then requires at least two jets satisfying a transverse energy criterion .",
    "the details of the selections can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measured cross - section is @xmath58 nb , with large error bars .    reproducing the experimental selections on the cross - section estimates , and keeping fixed all parameters as in the exclusive case",
    "we obtain a raw prediction of 11.4 nb , i.e. a factor 3.8 smaller than the measured mean value .",
    "swallows the normalization factor .",
    "] this prediction includes a fast simulation of detector resolution effects , using shw @xcite . considering the large uncertainties ,",
    "this result is quite encouraging . indeed , as mentioned above , the experimental errors are yet quite large .    in order to verify the dynamics of the model ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the dijet mass fraction , defined as the ratio of the mass measured in the central detector to the missing mass to the outgoing proton and antiproton . for exclusive events ,",
    "this ratio is expected to be about 0.8 @xcite given detector inefficiencies ; if inclusive events dominate , and the model is correct , one should observe a broad distribution below one , essentially given by the product of the pomeron structure functions .",
    "[ dijetmassfraction ] displays the mass fraction as measured by cdf , and the prediction of the present model . ) , neglecting the quark structure function .",
    "this assumption is justified by the weakness of the quark structure function ( 10 % ) , and the large error bar on the gluon structure function of about 50% @xcite . ]",
    "reasonable agreement is observed , suggesting that the hera pomeron structure functions allow for a correct description of inclusive dpe events .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize the strong influence of the behaviour of the ( hard ) gluon distribution of the pomeron on the predicted mass fraction . in fig .",
    "[ protonsf ] , we consider a `` proton - like '' ( @xmath59 , soft ) gluon distribution in the pomeron , leading to unsatisfactory results .",
    "[ p ]      assuming a global normalization as determined here and all other model parameters as given above , one is now in situation to give predictions for higgs boson production at the tevatron and the lhc . in a first stage , we assume no evolution of this normalization with energy . we will discuss later on the influence of the various parameters on the predictions , analyze the ( large ) uncertainties which still affect the results and , above all , what can be done in the future to handle them , both on experimental and theoretical grounds .",
    "for this sake , after scaling our model to the cdf tevatron run i predictions , we give predictions for various dpe processes which are relevant for tevatron run ii and lhc measurements .    in figs .",
    "[ crosster ] and [ crosslhcb ] , we give the integrated cross sections for dijets , quarks , @xmath5 , dileptons and diphotons at generator level for a mass higher than the mass @xmath60 given on the abscissa for the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "each figure is displayed for two different mass ranges , namely between 10 and 100 gev , and 100 and 160 gev .",
    "the differential cross - sections for dijet , dilepton and diphoton production are also given in fig .",
    "[ dijetxs ] and [ photonxs ] .",
    "the dijet cross - section is dominated by the gluon contribution .",
    "the quark jet contribution amounts 1% at small masses , and goes down to 0.1% at higher masses , both at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the @xmath5 contribution , which is about 20% of the total quark contribution , represents only about 0.02% of the dijet yield .",
    "the diphoton cross - section is small ( 4 orders of magnitude below the @xmath5 cross - section both at tevatron and lhc ) but still measurable at tevatron at low masses to test the model .",
    "these processes are much smaller than dijet production ( due to the weak qed coupling constant , and to the small quark component of the pomeron which initiates these processes ) , but they do have appreciable advantages which will appear in the following discussion . the dilepton cross - section is small ( same order of magnitude as the diphoton ) but enhanced by the presence of the @xmath61 pole ( see fig .  [ photonxs ] ) . numerical values for the cross - sections",
    "are also given in table [ cross ] .",

    "as is now well - known @xcite @xcite - a , exclusive dpe events are very attractive from the experimental point of view , since the measurement of the outgoing protons momenta , using dedicated forward detectors ( like roman pots or microchambers @xcite ) allows to determine the mass of the centrally produced system with excellent precision , so that the higgs boson signal can be extracted from the dpe continuum background .",
    "moreover , the background itself is strongly suppressed due to angular momentum conservation constraints ( the `` @xmath65 '' rule @xcite , see section [ formulation ] ) .",
    "exclusive dpe events are however not an experimentally established process according to the data currently at our disposal .",
    "as we have emphazised , the `` quasi - exclusive processes '' which are quite close in topology from the exclusive processes are established processes and may keep an essential part of the nice kinematical features of the exclusive production .    in general inclusive dpe events , the angular momentum constraint above does not apply and the background is not suppressed , so that the _ a priori _ signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath66 ) is similar to that of `` standard '' non - diffractive events .",
    "the missing mass method will not work as such , since the equality between the missing mass to the outgoing protons and the mass of the central system does not hold .",
    "however , inclusive dpe events can still be kinematically constrained in a much stronger way than non - diffractive events .",
    "if , in addition to the forward proton detectors , the experiments can dispose of very forward calorimetry ( e.g. up to @xmath67 , as was proposed in @xcite ) , one may use the measurement of the pomeron remnants to fully constrain the events kinematics . combined with the higher cross - sections predicted in this last case",
    ", it shows that such forward calorimetry would be adapted and necessary .",
    "the first resolutions using these detectors are given in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use the forward calorimeters as vetos .",
    "the central mass is reconstructed with the proton momenta only , and events are considered only if the measured remnant energy is small enough . in a sense",
    ", this is a way to select `` quasi - exclusive '' events .",
    "fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows the achievable resolution as a function of the remnant veto .",
    "let us finish this discussion with an important point concerning the interest of the @xmath6 decay mode .",
    "according to section [ modpred ] , the inclusive dpe @xmath6 cross - section is very small compared to the dpe dijet cross - section , and this is understood from the smallness of the qed coupling constant and the quark component of the pomeron .",
    "compared to this , the higgs boson branching fraction into @xmath1 pairs is still @xmath68 in the mass range we consider .",
    "it follows from the cross - sections given earlier ( see table [ iii ] , and fig .  [ higgsxsb ] ) that the cross - section ratio for @xmath1-pair events is @xmath69 at for example @xmath70 gev for inclusive dpe events , whereas this mode is invisible through non - diffractive events .",
    "of course , the missing energy in @xmath1 decays , the presence of the z peak in the @xmath1-pair cross - section , and other background processes not considered here spoil these numbers to some extent , but we do consider that this channel needs investigation .",
    "also note that a pseudoscalar higgs boson a , which appears in models with an extended higgs sector ( such as the supersymmetric models ) , does not couple to gauge bosons and hence preserves a significant branching fraction into @xmath1-pairs up to very high masses , where the effect of the z peak is negligible ; the same remark is true for the mssm h boson in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "the present work is meant to serve as a reference to the non factorizable , pomeron induced dpe model .",
    "* the original exclusive dpe formulation are recalled , and the inclusive expressions are introduced , see formulae ( [ dinclujj]-[dinclugg ] ) . * a systematic study is performed , that sheds light on the rle of the various model parameters .",
    "it is emphasized that the forthcoming tevatron data will allow to constrain their values , and answer the pending question of the existence of exclusive dpe production .",
    "* precise predictions for discovery physics at the lhc will then be possible ; we focused on the higgs boson case .",
    "* it is recalled that , assuming favourable exprimental installations , the @xmath71 decay mode of the higgs boson may well be exploited in double diffractive production .",
    "* on the theoretical side , the h@xmath72 channel is most promising , although some experimental difficulties have to be overcome .",
    "we wish to thank m. albrow , a. bialas , b. cox , r. enberg , v. khoze , r. orava , a de roeck , m. ryskin and l. schoeffel for useful discussions .",
    "one of us ( m.b . ) is grateful to the cea / dsm / spht for support .",
