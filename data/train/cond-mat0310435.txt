    "the enhanced nmr signals of laser - polarized @xmath0xe , which are about 10@xmath4 times larger than those from thermally polarized @xmath0xe @xcite , have opened the possibility to explore radiation damping effect @xcite of laser - polarized @xmath0xe .    since bloembergen and pound analyzed the physical process of radiation damping in 1954 @xcite , radiation damping had been noticed and studied in the early time @xcite .",
    "although the research of radiation damping in nmr had almost halted from 1960 to 1988 , it has once again evoked the interest of researchers in recent years because of the applications of high field magnets and high sensitive probes .",
    "since then , a large number of research articles and reviews have been published @xcite .",
    "radiation damping is a non - linear effect .",
    "the current , induced by the transverse magnetization in the receiver rf coil , interacts with the magnetization vector itself , tending to bring it back to the + z axis ( the direction of the static magnetic field ) .",
    "radiation damping is usually observed at high fields where liquid phase magnetization _ m _ , the static magnetic field homogeneity , and the quality factor",
    "_ q _ of the probe are high enough @xcite .",
    "the magnetization is _ _",
    "m=__@xmath5_cp _ in the light of the currie law , with @xmath6 the gyromagnetic ratio , _ p _ the polarization , and _ c _ the spin concentration . in aqueous solutions",
    "the water proton concentration is usually 110 mol / l ( _ _ c__@xmath7110 m ) , which is high enough to produce radiation damping effect .",
    "radiation damping can also be observed for other solvents and concentrated samples @xcite . according to the thermal - polarization _",
    "_ p__@xmath8__(b__@xmath8__,t)__@xmath9__hb__@xmath10__/(4__@xmath11_kt ) _ , either decreasing the temperature or increasing the magnetic field can enhance the polarization and make radiation damping effect stronger , but it can provide only limited relief .",
    "it s very natural to employ optical pumping and spin exchange @xcite to improve the polarization .",
    "although radiation damping of laser - polarized gaseous xenon was obtained at 14 t on bruker drx 600 spectrometer @xcite , the proper inversion of the magnetization could not be entirely intepreted with the dipolar field theory @xcite .",
    "the dipolar field effects @xcite , on the other hand , could explain nmr instabilities and spectral clustering in laser - polarized liquid xenon @xcite . in medical mri ,",
    "the existence of radiation damping both in the phantom experiments and in vivo affects the quality of imaging @xcite , and one can forsee that the same problem will emerge in application of the lung mri using hyperpolarized @xmath12he and @xmath0xe @xcite .",
    "therefore , until now , the microcosmic mechanism of radiation damping have be still not fully understood , and the corresponding dynamics problems need to be resolved .",
    "two recent articles @xcite have reported radiation damping of laser - polarized @xmath3he , which is easier to be observed than that of @xmath13xe because the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath6 and optical pumping efficiency of @xmath3he is larger than that of @xmath0xe . here",
    "we report first observation of radiation damping in laser - polarized liquid @xmath0xe at the low magnetic field in a flow system , and the typical radiation damped fid envelopes and spectra at different pulse flip angles are presented and compared with theoretical ones .",
    "characterization of such a system is important for hyperpolarized mri at low magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "our experiment could provide another liquid phase example to anlysis radiation damping effect .",
    "in addition , laser - polarized liquid xenon and its radiation damping also have a number of potential applications , such as construction of liquid xenon maser @xcite , rapid and precise measurement of liquid xenon polariztion @xcite , etc ..",
    "the diagram of our experimental apparatus is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the pump cell containing a few drops of metal cs was maintained at approximately 333@xmath14 k by the resistance heater during optical pumping .",
    "the inner surfaces of the cylindrical pyrex tube and the pump cell were coated with silane in order to slow down the relaxation of the @xmath0xe upon collision with the tube wall .",
    "the cell was placed in a 25 guass magnetic field generated by helmholtz coils .",
    "the whole system was evacuated with k2 valve close and k1 , k3 and k4 valves open .",
    "when the vacuum reached 1.5@xmath1510@xmath16 torr , the valves k1 , k4 were closed and k2 , k3 were opened .",
    "the cell was filled with 740 torr natural xenon gas ( 26% enriched @xmath0xe gas ) .",
    "after all the valves were closed , laser light from a 15 w laser array ( opto power co. model opc - d015 - 850-fcps ) at 852.1 nm was introduced to the system .",
    "the laser light resonates with the cs d@xmath17 transition line and induces an electron spin polarization in the cs vapor via a standard optical pumping process @xcite .",
    "the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe gas was produced by spin - exchange collision at the same time .",
    "the polarization process took about 25 minutes .",
    "k4 valve was then opened to allow the @xmath0xe to be transmitted into the probe , pre - cooled to 172@xmath14 k , of bruker sy-80 m nmr spectrometer .",
    "the temperature of the probe was , subsequently , reduced to 160@xmath14 k to freeze the xenon into condensed state .",
    "but the actual temperature , which was somewhat different from the monitor s , was improved from nmr observation that solid phase and liquid phase xenon co - exist in the probe because the temperature rang between the melting point and the boiling point of xenon was small ( 4.6@xmath18 @xmath19c ) . to study radiation damping of the liquid @xmath0xe ,",
    "the sample was cooled down to 142@xmath14 k to completely freeze the xenon , and then gradually warmed up and maintained at 166@xmath14 k.",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0xe nmr time domain signal ( a ) and the corresponding spectrum ( b ) at the temperature of 160@xmath14 k when 160@xmath19 pulse was applied .",
    "the peak with larger line width at high frequency ( @xmath20147 ) is assigned to solid @xmath0xe and the sharp peak with phase distortion ( @xmath20108 ) is from liquid @xmath0xe ( fig .",
    "such phase distortion is the typical result of the radiation damping .",
    "it should be noted that at the temperature of 166@xmath14 k , only liquid state @xmath0xe nmr signal at @xmath20108 is observable .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath0xe fid signals ( a1-a4 ) and the corresponding frequency spectra ( b1-b4 ) excited by 60@xmath19 , 90@xmath19 , 120@xmath19 , and 150@xmath19 pulses , respectively .",
    "compared with the water theoretical fid envelope and spectrum in figure 4 @xcite , these signals obviously indicated that the laser - polarized liquid @xmath0xe have radiation damping effects . unlike conventional fid ( fig .",

    "the radiation damping will also occur even when _ _ t__@xmath37__/t__@xmath2=2 .",

    "the phenomenon , that radiation damping occurs for liquid @xmath0xe but not for solid @xmath0xe under the same polarization condition , also demonstrates that radiation damping depends primarily on both the intensity of the magnetization and the characteristic time of radiation damping _ _ t__@xmath2 .",
    "the polarization in a flow system is not so high as that in the close pump cell or produced by the narrow bandwidth ti : sapphire laser @xcite .",
    "the main causes are : ( a ) the loss of polarization is due to the magnetic field inhomogeneity during the transfer of laser - polarized @xmath0xe gases .",
    "( b ) since the bandwidth of our diode laser array is 30 @xmath47 but the absorbed bandwidth of cs atom in the 740 torr natural xenon is only 30 ghz , the efficient pump power is only about 0.125 w. ( c ) the phase transition of laser - polarized @xmath0xe can also bring about the depolarization .",
    "( d ) the relaxation of @xmath0xe atoms at the walls still decreases the polarization even though they were coated .",
    "thus we can see the further possible improvements in our experiment by adopting the following techniques : ( a ) creating the homogeneous magnetic field by two - layer solenoid with end correction coils , and keeping the transmission of laser - polarized xenon paralleling the static magnetic field .",
    "( b ) increasing the gas pressure of the pump cell in order to enhance the optical - pumped absorbed power .",

    "usually radiation damping was observed only when the sample has high spin concentration , such as water protons , in the high magnetic field with high - resolution spectrometer .",
