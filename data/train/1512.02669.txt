    "<S> therefore , in order to study the phenomenon of many - body localization in a realistic setting it is important to address the effect of dissipation on such systems and understand the interplay with intrinsic localization properties of the many - body system .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a general framework to investigate the dynamics of a mbl system weakly coupled to a dissipative markovian bath . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the local integrals of motion of the closed localized system . </S>",
    "<S> using our general framework we discuss how observables relax in the presence of different types of dissipative baths . </S>",
    "<S> we note that earlier studies discussed the effects of a coupling to a thermal bath on the spectral properties of a mbl system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a particular example of dynamical relaxation of observables in a mbl system coupled to a bath has also been addressed recently in a numerical study  @xcite , where a slow stretched exponential decay of these observables was found in a wide regime . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the origin of this behavior and address how the relaxation properties depend on the interactions and on the type of bath affecting the system .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath8 are called jump operators , the system operators directly coupled to the bath . within a stochastic quantum - trajectory picture the unitary evolution of an ensemble of pure states is interrupted at random times by non - unitary quantum measurements ( or jumps ) generated by the operators @xmath8  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a full solution of the lindblad dynamics is a daunting quantum problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are able to greatly simplify it in the ( fully ) mbl phase , where the hamiltonian can be represented in terms of a complete set of quasi - local integrals of motion ( lioms )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding operators @xmath9 are in one - to - one correspondence and have a finite overlap with the truly local physical operators @xmath10 appearing in the original hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the fact that the unitary evolution deep in the mbl state is trivial in the liom basis . for physical initial conditions ( i.e. local in the physical basis @xmath10 ) the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in this basis dephase rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> hence , after a microscopic time scale ( of order @xmath11 ) the density matrix becomes effectively diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> within the quantum - trajectory picture , the jump operators @xmath8 act after random time intervals set by @xmath12 and project to a new state @xmath13 with off - diagonal elements in the liom basis . however , for sufficiently weak coupling ( @xmath14 ) , the density matrix has enough time to dephase between successive quantum jumps as local operators @xmath8 do not create resonances deep in the localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus view the density matrix as a classical ( joint ) probability distribution @xmath15 at all times .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the probability distribution is given by a classical master equation , where the quantum jumps generate the transition rates between classical configurations . </S>",

    "<S> we then consider two types of dissipative mechanisms that would ensue due to inelastic scattering of the atoms on the laser fields in the above mentioned experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the first mechanism is recoil and dephasing of the atom wavefunction implemented by a local measurement of the on - site density , @xmath26  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second one is particle loss , which is implemented by the jump operators @xmath27 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> non - interacting system  _ having described the general approach we now demonstrate it for the case of a non - interacting system [ @xmath28 in eq .  ] . </S>",
