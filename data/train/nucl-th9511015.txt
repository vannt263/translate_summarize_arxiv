    "a prerequisite for a theoretical description of the properties of @xmath1-mesons in hadronic matter and the possible consequences for @xmath1-production in heavy - ion collisions is a reliable model for elementary processes like @xmath1-production in hadronic collisions and in photo - induced reactions .",
    "new accurate data on the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons off protons @xcite as well as off deuterons @xcite provide strong constraints on models for the elementary @xmath1-meson  hadron and photon  hadron interactions .",
    "we present such a model which satisfies the requirements of unitarity and gauge invariance .",
    "an effective field theory is constructed , where the hadronic coupling constants and resonance masses are determined by fitting data on elastic @xmath0n scattering .",
    "the consistency of our model is checked by comparing the cross section for the inelastic channel @xmath0n@xmath3n with experiment ( see ref .",
    "having fixed the hadronic parameters of the theory , we now study electromagnetic processes , namely photoproduction of pions and etas off nucleons as well as off deuterons .",
    "in the @xmath4-matrix approach the @xmath5-matrix for the process @xmath6p@xmath7p is , to lowest order in the electromagnetic interaction , given by @xmath8 where the sum is over all open hadronic channels .",
    "the final - state interaction , included in @xmath9 , is entirely due to strong interactions . under the assumption that the total cross section for photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons is dominated by the s@xmath10 channel @xcite",
    ", we use our model @xcite for @xmath0n scattering and pion - induced @xmath1-meson production in this channel to describe the final state interaction .",
    "a crucial point is the inclusion of both resonances in the s@xmath10 channel , the s@xmath10(1535 ) and the s@xmath10(1650 ) .",
    "since both resonances couple to @xmath0n , @xmath1n and @xmath11n we include three channels , where the two - pion - continuum is parametrized by an effective scalar field @xmath12 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to satisfy unitarity",
    "we have to include all three channels @xmath13 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "we identify the resonance contributions to the @xmath4-matrix with the first diagram shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the lagrangian , which describes the coupling of the photon to the resonance , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the masses of resonance and nucleon , respectively .",
    "since the interaction has an isovector and an isoscalar part , there are two new coupling constants per resonance . in order to be consistent with the hadronic part of the model , which includes interaction terms of the linear sigma model , and to fulfill the low - energy theorems of pion photoproduction",
    "we also include non - resonant born terms in @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding interaction terms are obtained by coupling the photon to the lagrangian of the linear sigma model in a minimal way , which yields a coupling of the photon to the electromagnetic currents of nucleons and pions , respectively .",
    "furthermore we add a coupling to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon and vector - meson exchange contributions . in order to satisfy the low - energy theorems within the framework of the linear sigma model in the absence of loop",
    "diagrams an additional contact interaction of the form @xcite @xmath18 is added , which contains an anticommutator of nucleon isospin matrices .",
    "here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the isoscalar and isovector part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "the diagrams shown in fig .  1 are included in @xmath17 .",
    "we stress that the contact term in fig .  1 is not the kroll - ruderman term obtained by coupling the photon in a minimal way to a pseudovector @xmath0nn - interaction , but corresponds to the interaction ( 3 ) .",
    "consequently it is proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon . as will be discussed below the vector - meson exchange processes shown by the last two diagrams of fig",
    ".  1 also play an important role in @xmath21 .",
    "we introduce form factors for the contact term and the vector - meson exchange contributions .",
    "gauge invariance implies large cancellations between the form factor at the @xmath6nn - vertex , the one at the @xmath0nn - vertex and nucleon self - energy insertions @xcite .",
    "the net effect is that , for the current coupling in the born terms , the form factors in diagrams 2 , 3 and 5 of fig .",
    "1 are cancelled by other contributions .",
    "( 150,50 ) ( 5,5 )    next we have to determine the electromagnetic parameters , namely the isoscalar and isovector couplings of the photon to the two resonances and the cutoffs . the ideal way to proceed",
    "would again be to fix the parameters by fitting the e@xmath2-amplitude of pion photoproduction and then make a prediction for the total cross section for @xmath6p@xmath7p .",
    "however , in view of the fact that there are substantial deviations between different existing partial wave analyses for pion photoproduction this is not a practicable way .",
    "consequently we choose a more pragmatic approach and try to find a consistent description of the two processes .",
    "reasonable agreement with the data on the e@xmath2-amplitude of pion photoproduction in the different isospin channels ( not shown ) is obtained for a parameter set which also reproduces the total cross section for @xmath1-production off proton and deuteron .",
    "we find the following helicity amplitudes for the two resonances ( in units of @xmath22 gev@xmath23 ) : @xmath24=102 , @xmath25=82 for the s@xmath10(1535 ) and @xmath24=83 and @xmath25=24 for the s@xmath10(1650 ) .",
    "the result for the total cross section for the process @xmath6+p@xmath7+p is shown by the solid line in fig .  2 ( left ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the result if one completely neglects the presence of the second resonance and the vector - meson exchange contributions to @xmath21 and scales the result with a factor 0.7 while the long - dashed line is obtained if one includes the second resonance but not the vector - meson exchange terms .",
    "obviously the presence of the second resonance leads to destructive interference and a shift of the peak towards higher energies compared to a model which only includes one resonance .",
    "this shift is compensated by the vector - meson exchange contributions .",
    "we stress that the position of the peak in the photoproduction cross section is not sensitive to the remaining free coupling constants , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , when the second resonance is included we can not describe the data without vector - meson exchange contributions .",
    "this is an important difference to other models , where the second resonance was ignored @xcite .",
    "we note that the coupling of the s@xmath10(1650 ) to the @xmath1-meson is very weak and consequently neglected in our model . in spite of this",
    ", the second resonance plays an important role in the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons . in a coupled channel approach",
    "this is possible , in contrast to tree level calculations @xcite , since the s@xmath10(1650 ) couples to the @xmath1n - channel over intermediate @xmath0n , @xmath12n and s@xmath10(1535 ) states .",
    "( 150,70 ) ( -3,2 )    ( 150,70 ) ( -3,2 )    also shown in fig .",
    "2 is our result for photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons off the deuteron , computed in the impulse approximation . except for a deviation near threshold",
    "the agreement with the data is very good .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons off the nucleon is described within a unitary and gauge invariant model .",
    "elastic @xmath0n scattering data are used to determine the hadronic parameters of the model .",
    "the predicted cross section for pion - induced @xmath1-production agrees well with the data .",
    "we obtain a consistent description of photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons and pions satisfying the low - energy theorems for the latter reaction .",
    "we find that the s@xmath10(1650)-resonance plays an important role in all the processes we consider and that the inclusion of @xmath28- and @xmath29-exchange is crucial in the photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons .",
    "estimates of the @xmath1-nucleon pole terms in the framework of a nonlinear su(3)@xmath30su(3 ) sigma model with mesons and baryons indicate that their contributions to photoproduction of @xmath1-mesons is small and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , our model provides a consistent description of total cross sections of both pion- and photoinduced @xmath1-meson production . in order to describe differential cross sections",
    "one has to extend the model by including the p@xmath10 as well as the d@xmath31 channel @xcite .",
