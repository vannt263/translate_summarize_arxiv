    "the deuteron ( bound state of proton and neutron ) with spin @xmath0 and parity @xmath1 : @xmath2 , and with isospin @xmath3=0 , has been investigated , theoretically and experimentally , since many decades .",
    "few selected problems , which are very actual , will be discussed here according the following plan :    * the knowledge of the deuteron structure , itself , at the largest possible internal momenta ( or at the shortest distances between the nucleons ) .",
    "the question which is addressed is the definition of the kinematical region where a description based on nucleons and mesons ( basically impulse approximation ( ia ) with corrections due to meson exchange currents , isobars , relativistic effects .. ) has to be discarded in favor of a high energy view in terms of quarks and gluons . here ,",
    "in particular , pqcd gives predictions concerning the asymptotic behavior of the deuteron form factors and assumes hadron helicity conservation for the amplitudes .",
    "+ the transition region between these two regimes should be the privileged domain of intermediate energy machines .",
    "high intensity is required by exclusive measurements and/or studies with secondary beams ( polarization etc .. ) . *",
    "the deuteron as a probe to investigate the nucleon or the heavy nuclei structure . * * it can be used to study the properties of the neutron , which is not available as a target ; * * it is an isoscalar probe , which can be very selective in exciting specific states in nucleons and nuclei .    in order to illustrate the different points listed above",
    ", we will review some of the last data obtained at jefferson laboratory and saturne .",
    "we will show few results from elastic electron - deuteron scattering and proton - deuteron elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "particular attention will be devoted to polarization observables .",
    "the measurement of the differential cross section of elastic @xmath4scattering , for a fixed value of @xmath5 , at different scattering angles , allows to determine the structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the electron beam ( the scattered electron ) energy and @xmath12 the electron scattering angle in the laboratory system",
    ". the structure functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the three form factors , @xmath15 ( electric ) , @xmath16 ( magnetic ) and @xmath17 ( quadrupole ) as : @xmath18 where m is the deuteron mass . in case of unpolarized beam and",
    "target the outgoing deuteron is tensorially polarized and the components of the tensor polarization give useful combinations of form factors .",
    "in particular @xmath19 allows , together with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the determination of the three form factors : @xmath20g_m^2,\\ ] ] at the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) , the elastic @xmath4 cross section has been recently precisely measured up to large momentum transfer @xmath21 ( gev / c)@xmath22 , @xcite and @xmath19 has been measured for a momentum transfer up to @xmath23 ( gev / c)@xmath22 @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the cross sections seems to scale as @xmath24 , as previously pointed out @xcite , and predicted by pqcd .",
    "however , from the @xmath19 data , it clearly appears that the pqcd limit is not yet reached , and that the data follow the trend suggested by ia . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not possible , from these data , to constrain definitely different models or corrections . for a detailed comparison with theory ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the question is then , how to proceed further . on the experimental point of view , in the best presently achievable conditions of luminosity , about one month beam time was needed for the the polarization measurement and one week for the cross section at the largest values of @xmath5 .",
    "it seems hard to foresee more favorable experimental conditions , with the present technology related to electron machines .",
    "one possibility is to investigate the inelastic deuteron form factors through the reaction @xmath25 , where for the same momentum transfer for the electron , one acceeds to shortest distances in the deuteron , compared to elastic scattering @xcite .    in next section",
    "we will focus on a conceptual problem , which is the limit of the validity of the assumption of the one photon exchange mechanism in electron - hadron scattering at large momentum transfer .",
    "a related problem , that we will not discuss here , is that radiative corrections for polarization effects at large momentum transfer are not known .",
    "the formulas given above are valid if the momentum is transferred from the incident electron to the target by a virtual photon , with the underlying assumption that the possible two - photon contribution is small",
    ". the relative contribution of two photon exchange , from simple counting in @xmath26 , would be of the order of the fine structure constant , @xmath27 .",
    "however , more than 25 years ago it was observed that the relative role of two - photon exchange can increase significantly in the region of high momentum transfer @xcite . if the transferred momentum is equally shared between two virtual photons , due to the steep decrease of the deuteron form factors , the simple rule of @xmath26-counting for the estimation of the relative role of two - photon contribution to the amplitude of elastic @xmath4scattering does not hold anymore .",
    "this effect would manifest already at momentum transfer of the order of 1 gev@xmath28 , in particular in the region of diffractive minima .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the two - photon amplitude is purely imaginary , at least at small scattering angles , so it can not interfere with the one - photon exchange amplitude in the differential cross section for unpolarized particles scattering .",
    "however , in this case , the polarization observables in elastic @xmath4scattering have to be large , in particular the t - odd polarization observables . but",
    "the predicted increasing of the two - photon mechanism is so large that it may be observed even in the differential cross section of elastic @xmath4scattering , at relatively large momentum transfer square , @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "an evaluation of this contribution from the existing experimental data has been done in @xcite .",
    "the crossing symmetry can provide a relation between the matrix elements @xmath31 of the the elastic @xmath32 scattering and the @xmath33-annihilation : @xmath34 , in one - photon approximation . @xmath35 the line over @xmath31 denotes the sum over the polarizations of all particles ( in initial and final states ) .",
    "the mandelstam variable @xmath36 is the total energy square and @xmath37 is the momentum transfer square .",
    "they delimit different kinematical regions for the annihilation and the scattering channel .    the presence of a single virtual photon in the reaction @xmath38 constrains the total angular momentum @xmath0 and the @xmath1-parity for the @xmath39system to take only one possible value , @xmath40 , the quantum number of the photon . in the framework of the one - photon approximation , in the general case",
    ", @xmath41 can be written ( in cms ) as :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are definite quadratic combinations of the electromagnetic form factors for the hadron @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the angle of the detected hadron .    in case of the presence of @xmath47 in the intermediate state , in the annihilation channel , any value of the total angular momentum and space parity",
    "is allowed , because the relative 3-momentum for the @xmath47-state is nonzero , contrary to the case of the one - photon mechanism .",
    "the @xmath48-system , produced through @xmath49- and @xmath47-exchanges has different values of c - parity , because @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the interference of one- and two - photon contribution must be an * odd * function of @xmath52 : @xmath53",
    ".    the slac results @xcite where obtained at a fixed electron scattering angle .",
    "the odd contribution can then be estimated from the cross sections at two angles , for the same @xmath54 , one value being given from a fit of the data of ref .",
    "@xcite and the other by the recent data @xcite .",
    "we can then calculate separately the linear contribution or the cubic contribution in @xmath52 .",
    "it is expected that deviation from the linear @xmath55 formula would not appear for @xmath56 5 @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting ratios c / a and d / a are reported in fig . 1 and 2 as functions of @xmath54 , as open circles @xcite and open squares @xcite .",
    "the data nicely agree : at large momentum transfer these ratios deviate from zero and show a dependence on the transferred momentum , which could result from two photon exchange .",
    "however the points had to be rescaled in order to have zero deviation at low @xmath54 ( corresponding solid symbols ) due to systematic errors in the measurement of the cross section between the two sets of data @xcite and @xcite .    while this can not be considered as a definite evidence for the presence of @xmath47-exchange in @xmath4elastic scattering , it is the first attempt to obtain a quantitative upper limit of a possible @xmath47-contribution , using a parameterization of the @xmath57-interference and the existing experimental data .",
    "the @xmath47-exchange in elastic hadron scattering can be experimentally searched in different ways : - through the comparison of the cross section for scattering of unpolarized electrons and positrons ( by protons or deuterons ) in the same kinematical conditions , - looking to the deviation from a straight line on the rosenbluth plot or measuring specific properties of polarization phenomena : as nonzero @xmath58 polarization observables , and violation of definite relations between t - even polarization observables and the sf @xmath7 .",
    "the measurement of cross section and polarization observables bring complementary and independent pieces of information , as they test the real and imaginary part of the @xmath47 contribution .",
    "we showed that the measurement of cross section and analyzing powers in @xmath4elastic scattering allows to determine all the three form factors ( in one - photon approximation ) .",
    "these form factors , in ia , are integrals of the wave function over the radial coordinate . on the other hand ,",
    "the reactions @xmath60 ( backward elastic scattering ) and @xmath61 ( deuteron break up ) are directly related to the deuteron wave functions . in the ia",
    ", the tensor analyzing power @xmath62 and the polarization transfer @xmath63 can be written as :    @xmath64 @xmath65 from which one obtains a quadratic relation between @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath66 measurements have been performed at saturne and dubna @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the two polarization observables is shown in fig .",
    "the full line is the ia prediction .",
    "the two sets of points correspond to backward elastic scattering ( open circles ) and deuteron break up ( solid circles ) and they show a very similar behavior .",
    "the deviation from ia , which gets larger at larger momenta has been interpreted in different models ( see @xcite and refs . herein ) . at this moment",
    "it seems fair to conclude that unambiguous signatures of quarks have not yet been found .",
    "a promising way of looking to deuteron at very short distances seems to be the measurement of the tensor analyzing power of pions emitted at @xmath67 , in the reaction @xmath68 , in the cumulative region @xcite .",
    "having high precision data on the differential cross section for @xmath4 elastic scattering , and assuming a reliable model for their description , one can extract , in principle , the dependence of the electric neutron form factor   on the momentum transfer @xmath5 .",
    "such a procedure has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , up to @xmath5=0.7 ( gev / c)@xmath28 . it can be extended at higher @xmath5 using the elastic @xmath69-scattering data mentioned above and recent data on the proton electric form factor @xcite .",
    "these data have been obtain by the recoil proton polarization measurement in @xmath70 , following an idea suggested more than 30 years ago @xcite and extend up to @xmath5=3.5 ( gev / c)@xmath28 . the large sensitivity to the nucleon form factors of the models which describe the light nuclei structure , particularly the deuteron ,",
    "was already carefully studied in @xcite , and it was pointed out that the disagreement between the relativistic impulse approximation and the data could be significantly reduced if   were different from zero .    in the non relativistic ia , the deuteron form factors depend only on the deuteron wave function and on nucleon form factors : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the proton mass , = +   and = +   are the charge and magnetic isoscalar nucleon form factors , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 describe the deuteron structure and can be calculated from the deuteron @xmath77 and @xmath78 wave functions , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite : @xmath81,\\ ] ] @xmath82 w(r),\\ ] ] @xmath83j_0\\left ( \\frac{qr}{2}\\right ) +   \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\sqrt{2}u ( r)w(r)+w^2 ( r)\\right ] j_2\\left (   \\frac{qr}{2 } \\right ) , \\ ] ] @xmath84,\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the spherical bessel functions .",

    "then   is calculated using the experimental values for @xmath88 , assuming , for the magnetic nucleon form factors @xmath89 and @xmath90 the usual dipole dependence , which is in agreement with the existing data at a 3% level , up to @xmath91 10 ( gev / c)@xmath28 .    in fig .",
    "4 we illustrate the behavior of the different nucleon electric form factors : ,    and . the nucleon isoscalar electric form factor , derived from different sets of deuteron data , decreases when @xmath5 increases .",
    "the solid line represents the gari - krmpelmann parametrization @xcite for . the dipole behavior , which is generally assumed for the proton electric form factor is shown as a dotted line . the new   data , which decrease faster than the dipole function , are also well reproduced by the gari - krmpelmann parametrization ( thick dashed line ) .",
    "the electric neutron form factor can be calculated from the isoscalar nucleon form factor , taking for   a dipole behavior ( solid stars ) or a fit based on the new data ( open stars ) .",
    "the last option leads to values for   which are in very good agreement with the parametrization @xcite .",
    "these results shows that the neutron form factor is not going to vanish identically at large momentum transfer , but becomes more sizeable than predicted by other parametrizations , often used in the calculations @xcite ( thin dashed line ) .",
    "starting from @xmath92 ( gev / c)@xmath28 the form factor   becomes even larger than .",
    "let us mention that a recent direct measurement @xcite at @xmath93 ( gev / c)@xmath28 finds = @xmath94 in agreement with the present values .",
    "let us mention that the @xmath95-contribution , which is a good approximation for the isoscalar transition @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is a virtual photon ) , is typically considered as the main correction to ia , necessary , in particular , to improve the description of the sf @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however the relative role of mec is strongly model dependent @xcite as the coupling constants for meson - nn - vertexes are not well known and arbitrary form factors are often added @xcite .    it should be pointed out that the @xmath98 vertex is of magnetic nature and its contribution to @xmath6 has to be of the same order of magnitude as the relativistic corrections .    the forthcoming data about , planned at jlab up to @xmath5=2 ( gev / c)@xmath28 , @xcite will be crucial in this respect .",
    "the large sensitivity of the deuteron structure to the nucleon form factors shows the necessity to reconsider the role of meson exchange currents in the deuteron physics at large momentum transfer .",
    "the measurement of polarization transfer for inelastic @xmath99 and @xmath100 scattering by nuclei allows the study of the nuclear response and to disentangle the spin and isospin components .",
    "in particular it has been shown that he spin - flip probability is a very good signature of the presence of @xmath101 in the continuum , as well as for discrete states .",
    "a systematic work has been carried on at lampf and at saturne , on several nuclei , from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "the nuclear response has been measured in different channels and compared to rpa calculations , in order to learn about correlations and collectivity in nuclei @xcite .    in order to go further",
    ", one should complete measurements at very small angles ( with a zero degree facility ) and with high statistics , and make a multipole analysis in the continuum .",
    "an application of this method based on the measurement of the spin - flip probability , is the study of nucleon resonances , in the reaction @xmath104 .",
    "the selectivity of reactions such as @xmath105 or @xmath106 @xcite to the isoscalar part of the @xmath107-electroexcitation makes these processes complementary to electron - nucleon inelastic scattering , for the study of the @xmath107-structure .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the roper resonance @xcite in case of polarized deuteron beam , it has been shown @xcite that the @xmath108-exchange model gives a natural and simple description of the polarization phenomena for @xmath109 .",
    "the main ingredients of such model are the existing information about the deuteron electromagnetic form factors @xcite and the ratio @xmath110 of the longitudinal and transversal isoscalar cross sections for the excitation of the @xmath107-resonances @xcite .",
    "the @xmath108-meson is preferred , among the isoscalar mesons as @xmath111 or @xmath112 , for several reasons .",
    "the @xmath113 coupling is large ; the @xmath108-meson , being a spin 1 particle , can induce strong polarization effects and an energy - independent cross section .",
    "when it is considered as an @xmath114 , then the cross sections and the polarization observables can be calculated from the known electromagnetic properties of the deuteron and @xmath107 , through the vector dominance model .",
    "the tensor analyzing power in @xmath115 , @xmath62 , can be written in terms of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors as : @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are linear combinations of the standard electric , @xmath15 , magnetic @xmath16 and quadrupole @xmath17 deuteron form factors .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 characterizes the relative role of longitudinal and transversal isoscalar excitations in the transition @xmath120 .    from eq .",
    "( 5 ) one can see that all information about the @xmath121-vertex is contained in the function @xmath110 only . a zero value of @xmath110 results in a @xmath122 and @xmath123-independent value for @xmath62 , namely @xmath124 , for any value of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 is calculated using the collective string model in @xcite , assuming @xmath125 symmetry , including the contributions of the following resonances : @xmath126 , which are overlapping in this energy region .    in fig .",
    "5 we report the theoretical predictions for @xmath62 , in framework of @xmath108-model , together with the existing experimental data . in such approximation",
    "@xmath62 is a universal function of @xmath37 only , without any dependence on the initial deuteron momentum .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath62 for @xmath127 @xcite , for different momenta of the incident beam are shown as open symbols .",
    "these data show a scaling as a function of @xmath37 , with a small dependence on the incident momentum , in the interval 3.7 - 9 gev / c . on the same plot the data for the elastic scattering process",
    "@xmath128 @xcite are shown ( filled stars ) .",
    "these different data show a very similar behavior : negative values , with a minimum in the region @xmath129 and their value increase toward zero at larger @xmath130 .",
    "the lines are the result of the @xmath108-exchange model for the @xmath115 process : for @xmath131 ( dashed - dotted line ) , the calculation based on @xcite for the roper excitation only is represented by the dotted line and for the excitation of all the four resonances by the the full line .",
    "the deuteron electromagnetic form factors have been taken from @xcite , a calculation based on relativistic impulse approximation , and they reproduce well the @xmath132data for @xmath69 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "when @xmath133 or if the contribution of the deuteron magnetic form factor @xmath118 is neglected , then @xmath62 does not depend on the ratio @xmath110 , and coincides with @xmath19 for the elastic @xmath69-scattering ( with the same approximation ) .    from fig",
    "5 it appears that the @xmath122behavior of @xmath62 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath110 especially at relatively small @xmath110 , @xmath134 .",
    "the values of @xmath110 , predicted by model @xcite , give a very good description of the data , when taking into account the contribution of all four resonances .",
    "these data , in any case , exclude a very small value of @xmath135 as well as very large values of @xmath110 .",
    "only the roper resonance has a nonzero isoscalar longitudinal form factor .",
    "without excitation of the roper resonance , @xmath131 , ( in the considered kinematical region ) and the value for @xmath62 becomes @xmath122independent : @xmath136 , in evident disagreement with existing data .",
    "due to their specific quark structure , the resonances lying in the concerned mass region , such as @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , are characterized by a pure isovector nature of longitudinal virtual photons absorbed by the nucleons .",
    "the longitudinal amplitudes of @xmath137 and @xmath138 electroexcitation vanish due to a specific spin - flavor symmetry , while both isoscalar and isovector longitudinal couplings of @xmath140 and @xmath141 vanish identically .",
    "this behavior of the isoscalar form factors is essential for the correct description of the existing experimental data on the @xmath122dependence of @xmath62 for the process @xmath115 .",
    "one could improve the model taking into account for example , other meson exchanges , or the effects of the strong interaction in initial and final states .",
    "however these corrections are strongly model- and parameter- dependent and the existing experimental data are not good enough to constrain the additional parameters which have to be added .    the successful description of the polarization observable @xmath62 can be considered as a strong indication that the @xmath142 exchange is the main mechanism for the considered process and that the roper resonance is excited in this process .",
    "some of the recent results obtained in the study of the deuteron structure have been reviewed . despite the large precision and the new region of internal momentum explored , questions arised many decades ago are still actual :    * the relative role of different possible components in the deuteron wave function : isobar configurations , six - quark components , etc .. ; * the relativistic description of the deuteron structure : the number of independent components of the deuteron wave functions as well as the number and the nature of their arguments ; * the relative role of the different possible mechanisms in the simplest reactions with deuterons : for example the role of meson exchange current in the description of the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron ; * the kinematical region corresponding to the transition regime in the deuteron structure : i.e. from the nucleon - meson picture of the deuteron to the quark - gluon description .",
    "these problems are far from being solved .",
    "the experimental study of polarization phenomena remains the most fruitful way in this investigation . if , in the case of elastic @xmath69-scattering we are near the limits of the experimental possibilities , in reactions such as the deuteron photodisintegration , @xmath143 or the coherent pion photoproduction on on the deuteron @xmath144 , a wide program of polarization experiments can be realized , due to the rich spin structure of the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "moreover the experimental study of new reactions , such as the coherent neutral pion production on the deuteron , @xmath145 , in the near threshold region and in the @xmath146-region ( for large momentum transfer ) can bring useful information .",
    "these conclusions apply to the hadronic sector , too . the complete experiment for the simplest case , the @xmath59 backward elastic scattering , requires further steps which can be realized in principle in the nearest future .",
    "the study of the nucleon resonances through reactions induced by isoscalar probes as deuterons and @xmath26 particles seems to be very promising , in particular the polarization observables .",
