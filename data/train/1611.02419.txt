    "evolutionary game theory research has shown that reciprocal altruism drives the evolution of cooperation  @xcite . in this behavior , an individual acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness , while increasing another individual s fitness , with the expectation that the other individual will behave in a similar manner at a later time . this behavior has been observed in humans  @xcite and other primates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possibility of this behavior has even been suggested in vampire bats  @xcite and fishes  @xcite .",
    "axelrod  @xcite showed that cooperation based on reciprocity requires friendly interactions during the initial meeting in simulations of the iterated prisoner s dilemma game . because reciprocal cooperators cooperate with individuals who cooperated with them previously . indeed",
    ", experimental studies using game theory have shown that humans tend to be cooperative in their first meetings without prior interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , an interaction with strangers can be risky because it is difficult to know each other s levels of cooperativeness .",
    "therefore , mechanisms for cooperation ( kin selection  @xcite , direct reciprocity  @xcite , indirect reciprocity  @xcite , and tags  @xcite ) generate a structured interaction where individuals interact more frequently with acquaintances because strangers may be exploiters .",
    "nonetheless , humans tend to be cooperative during their first meetings without prior interactions  @xcite .",
    "the evidences  @xcite has been acquired in modeled environments based on the constrained behaviors of humans , or agents , to explicitly analyze their social behavior , e.g. , they had to select their strategies without prior interactions .",
    "however , in the real world , we engage in lightweight preliminary interactions , such as observing , eye contact , bowing , and greeting each other .",
    "therefore , it is important to study these preliminary interactions in a less restrictive environment than that imposed in experimental studies .    in this study , we analyzed the interactions during initial meetings to understand risk reduction behavior in the construction of reciprocal relationships in a social network game ( sng ) . in the game",
    ", numerous players can behave more freely than possible in the environments used in previous theoretical and experimental studies  @xcite , i.e. , they did not need to select from a sequence of several alternatives because they always had multiple alternatives and the actions of all the players can be recorded .",
    "in addition , the following features of the sng make it easier to analyze reciprocal relationships .",
    "the game allows real players to cooperate and compete with others in situations where the player s benefit is represented by a quantitative value , such as a payoff in game theory .",
    "a previous study  @xcite demonstrated the existence of reciprocal relationships where cooperators had more advantages than non - cooperators in this sng .",
    "many previous studies have used data obtained from interactive online games , particularly in social science  @xcite , e.g. , the dynamics of virtual world economics  @xcite , human migration behavior  @xcite , gender differences in social behavior  @xcite , and reciprocal cooperation  @xcite",
    "in this section , we provide the minimal sng information and we define cooperative behavior in the sng ( see appendices a.1 , a.2 , and a.3 for the game information , rules , and definition , respectively ) .",
    "we analyzed cooperative behavior in the sng , `` girl friend beta , '' where players acquired `` event points '' and competed in the rankings based on these points because the players received better awards as their rankings increased ( fig .",
    "[ fig_game_abst ] ) .",
    "this sng was released on 10/29/2012 .",
    "the player s ranking order was determined by the sum of event points obtained in the period from 3/25/2013 to 4/8/2013 .",
    "players must use their energy to obtain event points ; therefore , the number of actions by player is finite .",
    "there are two methods for replenishing these points : waiting for the points to replenish over time and using a paid item .",
    "players must use their resources ( items and time ) in an effective manner to progress to a higher ranking because their time and money are finite .",
    "players belong to groups and they must cooperate with each other to play the game efficiently .",
    "the groups are limited to 150 players .",
    "the sng was designed to ensure that cooperation with group members results in more effective game play .",
    "we filtered out players who did not belong to groups because most of the active players must belong to groups to play effectively .",
    "players can create groups on their own .",
    "others can apply to join groups at any time and then join a group after the acceptance of their application by an administrator , who was typically a group founder .",
    "players can leave a group at any time and apply to join a different group .",
    "we regarded this behavior as migration .",
    "the migrants were newcomers for the existing group members .",
    "we regarded interactions between migrants ( newcomers ) and the existing group members within 48 hours of migration as initial meetings .",
    "players can observe the behavior of members of their group ( e.g. , attack on common enemies ; the details are provided later ) because the game system showed their behavior on the game screen .",
    "we targeted groups of five or more active players who logged in at least one or more times to analyze their social interactions .",
    "players can communicate at any time using three types of simple text messaging .",
    "the first type is a message from one player to another ( direct messaging ) .",
    "the second type is a message from a player to their group members ( group messaging ) .",
    "the third type is a posting on the forum for their group ( forum posting ) .",
    "these messages have no negative effects on either the senders or receivers , but they also have few or no positive effects . points to enter the lottery and",
    "the effect of the card is small , i.e. , the points do not increase the players abilities . ]",
    "we limited the data to intragroup communication and cooperation .    .",
    "payoff matrix for the leader game , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , pareto efficiency is achieved when one cooperates and the other does not cooperate .",
    "the cooperator then obtains @xmath2 and the noncooperator receives @xmath3 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in simple terms , consider that two players battled an enemy in this scenario , where their relationship is represented in table [ table_payoff_matrix ] .",
    "the relationship between the variables is @xmath4 in this payoff matrix .",
    "attack is not efficient , when @xmath2 is less than @xmath3 . however",
    ", if they do not attack the enemy , they waste time by waiting for someone else to attack , i.e. , @xmath5 is lowest .",
    "it is not possible to cooperate both players in this scenario , because an attack on the enemy by either player immediately defeats the enemy .",
    "the values of this payoff matrix depend on each players situation , e.g. , the differences between the two attack powers is larger than @xmath3 , because the attack points replenish the next morning . ] . in the scenario ,",
    "both try to avoid the worst situation ( i.e. , they get @xmath5 ) , but they also do not want to pay the cost to avoid the worst situation ( i.e. , they do not want to get @xmath2 ) .",
    "this social dilemma is similar to the one in the `` leader game '' ( table [ table_leader_payoff_matrix ] ) . in that game ,",
    "pareto efficiency is achieved when one cooperates , and the other does not .",
    "then , the cooperator receives @xmath2 , and the noncooperator @xmath3 .",
    "that is , players receive a high payoff by sharing @xmath2 and @xmath3 on repeated plays of the game , a process known as @xmath6 reciprocity@xcite .",
    "we recognized this cooperative behavior , which provided the payoff @xmath3 from one to the other , as a cooperative behavior in this scenario .",
    "cooperative behavior is an inefficient attack , as shown in table [ table_payoff_matrix ] ; thus we define @xmath7 as the attack efficiency indicator : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the event points in player @xmath10 s @xmath11th attack and @xmath12 is the median of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the frequency of player @xmath10 s attacks ) .",
    "we considered cooperative behavior to be in the range of @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , we define @xmath16 as the proportion of cooperative behavior ( @xmath17 ) for player @xmath10 .",
    "we regarded a cooperator as a player where @xmath18 ."
