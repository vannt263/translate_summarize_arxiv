    "a possibility to influence the emission of light by tailoring the dielectric environment of emitting objects has been attracting a great deal of attention since a pioneering work by yablonovitch .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "it was suggested that a three - dimensional periodic modulation of the dielectric constant can result in formation of a photonic band structure , consisting of allowed and forbidden photonic bands in analogy with electronic band structure .",
    "one of the important consequences of the band structure is a modification of electromagnetic density of states , which can be used to suppress or enhance the rate of the spontaneous emission of emitters embedded in a photonic crystal . while such drastic effects as the full inhibition of the spontaneous emission proved to be difficult to achieve,@xcite there is still a growing interest in emission properties of photonic crystals , which even in the absence of complete photonic band - gap may result in a significant modification of properties of emitted radiation . if one is not looking to achieve the full inhibition of the spontaneous emission , the systems in which a periodic modulation takes place in only two or even one dimension are also of interest , because even though they can not confine light completely , they do modify emission patterns for particular directions , which can be useful for various applications .",
    "one - dimensional structures attract a particularly great attention , firstly , because they are easiest to manufacture , and secondly , because they allow for a detailed theoretical description .",
    "these two circumstances make one - dimensional structures most suitable candidates for a number of applications that do not require modification of the electromagnetic properties in all three dimensions . at the same time , certain properties of one - dimensional structures are typical for two- and three - dimensional systems as well , and , therefore , these structures provide a convenient testing area for understanding some general properties of media with spatial modulation of the dielectric function .",
    "most of the previous works addressed the problem of the spontaneous emission in 1d photonic structures from the perspective of individual emitters embedded in special dielectric environments such as superlattices or a fabry - perot cavities ( see , for instance , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical analysis of these situations is based on the assumption that the structure of photonic modes is determined solely by the periodical modulation of the dielectric function .",
    "the interaction between the photonic modes and emitters is considered in this approach as weak in a sense , that it does not affect the structure of the photonic modes , and can be treated perturbatively within the framework of fermi golden rule .",
    "these assumptions , however , break down in the important case of so called resonant photonic crystals , that have begun attracting considerable attention in recent years .",
    "these structures are composed of periodically distributed structural elements containing dipole active internal excitations , which co - exist with periodic modulation of the dielectric constant .",
    "multiple - quantum - wells@xcite ( mqw ) present one of the popular realizations of such structures with the one - dimensional periodicity .",
    "excitons confined within quantum wells provide optically active excitations , and the contrast between refractive indices of wells and barriers is responsible for periodic modulation of the dielectric constant .",
    "when the period of the structure satisfies a special , so called , bragg condition , the interaction between light and excitons can not be considered as weak , and can not be treated with the help of the fermi golden rule .",
    "excitons and periodic modulation of the refractive index play in such structures equally important roles in the formation of the photon modes , which should be more appropriately called polaritons . the bragg condition , in its most general form can be written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the change of the phase of the propagating electromagnetic wave over one period of the structure calculated at the exciton frequency @xmath2@xcite .",
    "if one neglects the refractive index contrast ( optical lattice approximation ) this condition can be rewritten as @xmath3,@xcite where @xmath4 is the period of the structure , and @xmath5 is the speed of light in the medium .",
    "the emission of light in such structures differs significantly from the cases considered in refs .  .",
    "the emitters of light in resonant photonic crystals affect the spatial structure of electromagnetic modes as much as the modulation of the refractive index . as a result",
    ", the processes of light emission by a particular quantum well and its propagation inside the structure should be considered on equal footing . to develop a theoretical formalism for dealing with such situations",
    "is the main objective of this paper . while focusing on the luminescent properties of bragg mqw structures",
    ", we will treat them in a broad context of resonant photonic crystals .",
    "this allows us to develop a universal theoretical formalism , applicable to essentially any type of one dimensional structures with periodically distributed emitters .",
    "since we will be interested in the effects of photonic environment on the luminescence rather than in a microscopical description of the processes of the exciton relaxation and recombination , we will base our theory on macroscopical maxwell equations with a non - coherent polarization source term , which would simulate non - coherent exciton population created by a non - resonant pumping .",
    "the phenomenological nature of our work distinguishes it from recent paper , in which microscopic theory of spontaneous emission of bragg mqw structures was based on an approach , in which both electron - hole dynamics and electromagnetic field were treated quantum - mechanically@xcite .",
    "phenomenological nature of our theory allows for establishing a direct and clear connection between global optical properties of mqw structures and their luminescence spectra , which is important for understanding an intimate relationship between geometrical structure of mqw systems and their emission properties . on the other hand , properties of the polarization source entering our calculations as a phenomenological object",
    "can only be established either from independent experiments or on the basis of microscopical theories of the kind developed in ref . .",
    "the theoretical formalism developed in this paper solves also a more general problem of calculating an optical linear response of finite 1d resonant photonic crystals .",
    "usually , the linear response is studied using green s function formalism , based on spectral representation of the green s function .",
    "the later , however , is not very well suited to deal with finite structures whose normal modes can not be considered as eigenfunctions of a hermitian operator . in our approach",
    "we develop a method of relating green s function of the finite resonant photonic crystal to transfer matrices describing reflection and transmission properties of these structures .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section  [ sec : macroscopic_maxwell_equations ] we formulate the basic equations describing the distribution of the electric field in the structure and introduce the basic elements of our transfer matrix approach . in section  [ sec : greens_function ]",
    "we conclude the presentation of the general formalism by deriving a general expression for the respective green s function . in section  [ sec : emission_spectrum ] the general formalism is applied to the problem of the exciton luminescence spectrum in resonant photonic crystals .",
    "in addition to considering an ideal periodic structure , we also discuss the role of inhomogeneous broadening , modifications in the luminescence induced by a deliberate introduction defects in the otherwise periodic structure , and relation between luminescence and absorption spectra .",
    "the paper is concluded with appendix , where we discuss relation between our phenomenological approach and microscopic theories .",
    "our approach to description of emission properties of mqw structures is based on solution of classical maxwell equations for monochromatic field with frequency @xmath6 of the following form : @xmath7,\\ ] ] where the coordinate @xmath8 is chosen to represent the growth direction of the structure , and @xmath9 is the periodically modulated background index of refraction : @xmath10 . the polarization in this equation is presented as a sum of two terms .",
    "first of them , @xmath11 , originates from optical transitions , with frequencies within the spectral region of interest and has , therefore resonant behavior .",
    "the second contribution , @xmath12 , arises due to other emitting transitions , which are non - resonant at given frequencies . in typical experimental situation involving @xmath13 quantum wells",
    ", the resonant term corresponds to polarization due to @xmath14 heavy - hole excitons , and the non - resonant contribution can be considered as a contribution from all other optically active transitions between states of electron - hole system .",
    "such a separation of polarization into contributions from different optical transitions is possible if one neglects coulomb correlations between exciton states and electron - hole plasma .",
    "these correlations are important for for highly excited states of semiconductors@xcite , but can be neglected if concentration of photo - excited electron - hole pairs is not too high , which is the situation considered in this work",

    "the expression proportional to the electric field in this equation describes direct optical excitation of excitons , while the second term , represented by function @xmath21 , introduces an additional source of exciton polarization due to non - radiative processes .",
    "depending on the properties of this term it can describe either coherent or non - coherent emission .",
    "more detailed description of function @xmath21 in relation to the description of luminescence , as well as general justification of the phenomenological approach to this problem is given below in section [ sec : emission_spectrum ] .",
    "here we will treat @xmath21 as an arbitrary function responsible for generation of exciton polarization .    writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : exciton_polarization_singleqw ] ) we explicitly take into account that the dipole moment of heavy - hole excitons is oriented in the plane of the well and , therefore , only components of the field perpendicular to the growth direction , @xmath22 , enter the expression for coherent exciton polarization .",
    "the intensity of the exciton - light interaction is characterized by the exciton susceptibility @xmath23 . neglecting the exciton dispersion in the plane of the quantum well and the inhomogeneous broadening the susceptibility",

    "the exciton polarization of the entire mqw system is the sum of polarizations of individual wells : @xmath28 here we assume that the period of the spatial arrangement of the quantum wells coincides with the period of the modulation of the dielectric function , such that the distance between adjacent wells is @xmath29 . in principle , the non - resonant polarization term is also a sum of contribution from different wells , but since it does not depend on electric field , it is more convenient to keep it in the equation as a single term .    maxwell equation ( [ eq : mawell_equation_start ] ) together with polarization given by eq .",

    "in the present paper we studied spectrum of non - coherent radiation emitted by one - dimensional resonant photonic crystal structures . while for concreteness we focused on exciton luminescence in multiple - quantum - well structures , the general theoretical framework developed in this work can be applied to other structures of this sort .",
    "the results obtained in the paper can be classified in two groups .",
    "first , we have developed a powerful method of solving general linear response type of problems for one - dimensional layered structures of general type .",
    "the problem of luminescence of one - dimensional resonant photonic structures is just one example of such problems , in which one is looking for the radiative response of the system caused by incoherent periodically distributed emitters .",
    "our approach allows expressing greens function of the structure in terms of transfer matrices describing propagation of the radiation through the system . as a result",
    "we are able to present the spectrum of the emitted light in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients of the structure in question . also , with the help of a special version of transfer - matrix description of transmission / reflection properties of resonant photonic crystals developed in recent refs .",
    "and we were able to obtain a closed analytical expression for the spectrum of luminescence of an resonance photonic crystal structure with an arbitrary number of identical periods .",
    "an important characteristics of these general results is that they are obtained in terms of particular solutions of an initial value problem for a structure with an arbitrary spatial profile of the refractive index .",
    "the latter problem can always be easily solved either analytically , or in most cases at least numerically , and , therefore , emission characteristics are expressed in our approach in terms of easily accessible quantities .",
    "the second group of the results is concerned with application of our general formalism to the particular case of bragg or near - bragg multiple - quantum - well structures .",
    "we analyzed the luminescence spectrum of these structures and established its main qualitative and quantitative characteristics .",
    "in particular , we explained the absence of luminescence in the spectral region of polariton stop - band , which was shown to be due to a combination of two factors : diminishing of transmission of light through the structure in the vicinity of the exciton frequency , and a significant spectral separation of the latter from transparent regions because of formation of the wide band - gap .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result agrees with quantum - field calculations of ref . , where similar effect was called `` subradiance '' .",
    "our calculations show , however , that this effect can be explained on purely classical ground .",
    "we also considered modification of the spectrum when the period of the structure becomes slightly de - tuned from the exact bragg conditions .",
    "comparison of our calculations with experimental spectra demonstrated an important role played by inhomogeneous broadening of excitons in formation of the spectra of luminescence of the structures under consideration .",
    "we also showed that these spectra are influenced by a great deal of other effects such as attenuation of the pump , or presence of cladding layers in the structure .",
    "we found that our calculations produce good agreement with experiment in terms of positions of the peaks of the luminescence , but not for the relative height of the peaks .",
    "this , however , is not very surprising , because the intensities of the peaks depend on many various circumstances .",
    "one of the most intriguing effect , which was not considered in the paper , but which could significantly influence the distribution of the luminescence intensity between its peaks , is acoustic phonon - induced scattering between collective exciton polariton states formed in quasi - bragg mqw structures .",
    "this possibility is supported by the fact that spectral separation between luminescence peaks in typical experiments is of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath314 ) as an average energy of acoustic phonons in @xmath315 .",
    "consideration of this effect is out of the scope of the current paper , but will be presented in the subsequent publications .    in order to achieve a better understanding of luminescence of the quasi - bragg structures , one needs additional experimental data , which would provide information for assessing the role of different effects .",
    "for instance , since one can , to some extent , control inhomogeneous broadening of excitons by growth conditions , luminescence measurements on a series on sample grown under different conditions could clarify the role of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "another possibility can be to excite luminescence by pumping the sample from both sides , which will reduce effects due to inhomogeneity of source function , and assess the role of this effect .",
    "temperature dependence of the intensity of the luminescent maxima can be used to verify the role of acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "an interested question studied in the last section of the paper is concerned with relation between luminescence and absorption spectra in multiple - quantum - well structures .",
    "first , using thermodynamical arguments we derived a version of kirchhoff s law specifically adapted for one - dimensional structures under consideration .",
    "then , using developed formalism , we were able to establish the relation between luminescence and absorption in terms of microscopic characteristics of the system such as polarization correlation function and exciton susceptibility .",
    "comparing the two results we established a relation between the microscopic parameters consistent with the kirchhoff s law .",
    "in particular , we found that if the spectral region of interest is small compared to the characteristic energy scale of the photon distribution function , both polarization correlation function and the non - radiative decay rate of excitons can be considered as frequency independent .",
