    "recent theoretical work has just begun to include realistic feedback effects in cluster - scale models , including protostellar outflows @xcite , photoionization / hii regions @xcite , and radiative feedback @xcite .",
    "however , current models do not include all feedback mechanisms , and hence do not address the question of which mechanism(s ) are most important at which stages of ( proto)cluster formation , or of how these mechanisms interact .",
    "egos are an outflow - selected sample . hence , characterizing their outflows as well as other possible forms of feedback ( ionized jets / winds , gas heating ) will help to establish whether there is an outflow - dominated stage of ( proto)cluster formation .",
    "addressing this question in a statistically meaningful way will require high resolution ( sub)mm wavelength data similar to those presented here for a wide range of ego sources .",
    "high - resolution cm continuum data are also necessary to constrain the presence and physical properties of ionized gas , while cm - wavelength line observations ( e.g. of nh@xmath4 ) are needed to constrain gas temperatures and densities in cool cores that lack mm - wavelength line emission .",
    "accumulating uniform datasets for large samples is essential for comparisons of different objects .",
    "the capabilities of the evla and alma put such surveys within reach , and egos will be promising targets for these instruments .",
    "one fortunate characteristic of egos is the probable 229.759 ghz ch@xmath4oh class i maser line which we detect toward both objects .",
    "these are , to our knowledge , the fifth and sixth reported examples of this maser in the literature , although higher resolution observations are still required to unambiquously confirm the maser nature of the emission based on the brightness temperature . as with the 44 ghz class",
    "i masers , these features may be common in massive star - forming regions .",
    "if so , they will be of interest as self - calibration targets to help enable future very high - resolution 1.3 mm observations ( e.g. with alma ) .",
    "our high - resolution millimeter observations of two egos unambiguously show that they are young mysos driving massive bipolar outflows .",
    "the spatial coincidence of high velocity @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) and hco@xmath2(1 - 0 ) emission with the extended 4.5 @xmath0 m lobes supports the outflow hypothesis for the 4.5 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "a single dominant outflow is identified in each ego , with tentative evidence for multiple outflows in one source ( g11.92@xmath30.61 ) .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of the sio(2 - 1 ) emission differ from the other outflow tracers in that some of the strongest red and blueshifted features are offset from the extended 4.5 @xmath0 m emission , and may trace the impact of outflow shocks on dense gas in the surrounding cloud .",
    "the morphology of the high - velocity gas with respect to 44 ghz class i ch@xmath4oh maser emission further solidifies the association of this type of maser with outflows .",
    "anomalously intense and narrow components of 229.759 ghz ch@xmath4oh emission are also detected in the outflow lobes from both objects , suggesting additional class i maser activity . the outflow driving sources appear as compact cores of millimeter continuum emission and dense gas , including the hot core molecules ch@xmath4oh , ch@xmath35cn and ocs .",
    "coincident with 22 ghz water maser emisson , g11.92@xmath30.61-mm1 shows considerably richer and stronger hot core line emission than g19.01@xmath30.03-mm1 , consistent with its warmer temperature derived from the multi - transition analysis of the ch@xmath35cn and ch@xmath4oh emission ( 166@xmath4920 v. 114@xmath4915 k ) .",
    "both hot cores exhibit 24 @xmath0 m and 70 @xmath0 m emission in mipsgal images and contain 6.7 ghz class ii ch@xmath4oh masers , all consistent with their identification as mysos .",
    "our observations also reveal considerable diversity within the ego sample .",
    "although observed at the same spatial resolution , g19.01@xmath30.03 appears as a single myso while g11.92@xmath30.61 resolves into a cluster of three compact dust cores .",
    "in addition to the difference in multiplicity , several other factors point to g19.01@xmath30.03 being in a earlier evolutionary stage : sed modeling , the relative weakness of its hot core emission , and the dominance of the extended envelope of molecular gas .",
    "in contrast , g11.92@xmath30.61 appears to have already formed a protocluster whose members span a range of ages ",
    "one is a hot core and two are almost entirely devoid of line emission .",
    "these initial results demonstrate the potential of the ego sample for probing the importance of protostellar feedback in the formation of massive stars and star clusters .",
    "the future capabilities of the evla and alma will enable uniform surveys of a statistically meaningful number of regions which will enable the relative importance of outflows , photoionization , and radiative feedback to be assessed .",
