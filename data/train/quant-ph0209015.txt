    "quantum computing is an emerging scientific discipline , in which the merging and mutual cross - fertilization of two of the most important developments in physical science and information technology of the past century  quantum mechanics and computing  has resulted in an extraordinarily rapid rate of progress of interdisciplinary nature .",
    "interesting problems to address in this context include fundamental questions as to what are the ultimate physical limits of computation and communication . for introductions to quantum computing and quantum information processing",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) was first suggested by zanardi and rasetti in ref .",
    "the concept has been further developed in refs .",
    "the suggestion is very intriguing itself ; quantum - logical operations are achieved by driving a degenerate system around adiabatic loops in the parameter manifold .",
    "the resulting gates are a generalization of the celebrated berry phase @xcite to encompass a degenerate system .",
    "these are , in fact , non - abelian holonomies . due to the geometric nature of these gates ,",
    "quantum information processing is expected to be fault tolerant .",
    "for instance the issue of timing and the lack of spontaneous decay are definite strengths of hqc . here",
    "we study the construction of holonomic quantum - logic gates numerically for the first time via solving a certain inverse problem .",
    "namely , we find the loop @xmath0 corresponding to the desired unitary operator @xmath1 by solving a high - dimensional optimization task .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we present the physical and mathematical background underlying our approach",
    ". sections  [ sec3 ] ,  [ sec4 ] and  [ sec5 ] comprise the main part of the present paper .",
    "loop parameterizations for one- and two - qubit gates are presented in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the numerical method is introduced in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "then the optimal realization of a unitary gate as a holonomy associated with a loop in the parameter space is investigated numerically in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] discusses the results .",
    "here we first review the concept of non - abelian holonomy to establish notation conventions .",
    "let us consider a family of hamiltonians @xmath2 .",
    "the point @xmath3 , continuously parameterizing the hamiltonian , is an element of a manifold @xmath4 called the control manifold and the local coordinate of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "it is assumed that there exists only a finite number of eigenvalues @xmath6 for an arbitrary @xmath7 and that no level crossings occur .",
    "suppose the @xmath8-th eigenvalue @xmath9 is @xmath10-fold degenerate for any @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the degenerate subspace at @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian is expressed as an @xmath14 matrix .",
    "the orthonormal basis vectors of @xmath13 are denoted by @xmath15 ; @xmath16 note that there are @xmath17 degrees of freedom in the choice of the basis vectors @xmath18 .",
    "let us now assume that the parameter @xmath3 is changed adiabatically .",
    "we will be concerned with a particular subspace , say the ground state @xmath19 and we drop the index @xmath8 to simplify the notation .",
    "suppose the initial state at @xmath20 is an eigenstate @xmath21 with the energy @xmath22 possibly through shifting the zero - point of the energy .",
    "in fact , we are not interested in the dynamical phase at all and hence assume that the eigenvalue in this subspace vanishes for any @xmath11 .",
    "the schrdinger equation is @xmath23 whose solution may be assumed to take the form @xmath24 the unitarity of the matrix @xmath25 follows from the normalization of @xmath26 . by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) into ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , one finds that @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 the formal solution may be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time - ordering operator and @xmath31 let us introduce the lie - algebra - valued connection @xmath32 through which @xmath33 is expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the path - ordering operator .",
    "note that @xmath36 is anti - hermitian , @xmath37 .",
    "suppose the path @xmath38 is a loop @xmath39 in @xmath4 such that @xmath40",
    ". then it is found after traversing @xmath41 that one ends up with the state @xmath42 where use has been made of the definition @xmath43 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath44 is called the holonomy associated with the loop @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is independent of the parameterization of the path but only depends upon its geometric image in @xmath4 .",
    "the space of all the loops based at @xmath46 is denoted @xmath47 \\to \\mathcal{m}| \\gamma(0 ) = \\gamma(t ) = \\lambda_0\\}.\\ ] ] the set of the holonomy @xmath48 has a group structure @xcite and is called the holonomy group .",
    "it is clear that @xmath49 .",
    "the connection @xmath50 is called irreducible when @xmath51 .",
    "to make things tractable , we employ a simple model hamiltonian called the three - state model as the basic building block for our strategy .",
    "this is a 3-dimensional hamiltonian with the matrix form @xmath52 the first column ( row ) of the matrix refers to the auxiliary state @xmath53 with the energy @xmath54 while the second and the third columns ( rows ) refer to the vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , with vanishing energy .",
    "the qubit consists of the last two vectors .",
    "the control manifold of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:11 ] ) is the complex projective space @xmath57 .",
    "this is seen most directly as follows : the most general form of the iso - spectral deformation of the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "note , however , that not all the elements of @xmath60 are independent .",
    "it is clear that @xmath61 is independent of the overall phase of @xmath62 , which reduces the number of degrees of freedom from @xmath60 to @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , any element of @xmath64 may be decomposed into a product of three @xmath65 matrices as follows @xmath66 which is know as the givens decomposition . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath61 is independent of @xmath69 since @xmath70 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this further reduces the physical degrees of freedom to @xmath71 .",
    "the product @xmath72 contains six parameters while @xmath73 is five - dimensional ; there must be one redundant parameter in @xmath72 .",
    "this parameter is easily found out by writing the product explicitly .",
    "the result depends only on the combination @xmath74 and not on individual parameters .",
    "accordingly , we may redefine @xmath75 as @xmath74 to eliminate @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , after this redefinition we find that the hamiltonian depends only on @xmath77 and @xmath78 and hence @xmath79 may also be subsumed by redefining @xmath80 and @xmath75 , which reduces the independent degrees of freedom down to @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 $ ] be the homogeneous coordinate of @xmath57 and @xmath83 be the corresponding inhomogeneous coordinate , where @xmath84 in the coordinate neighborhood with @xmath85 .",
    "if we write @xmath86 , the above correspondence , i.e. the embedding of @xmath57 into @xmath60 , is explicitly given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the connection coefficients are easily calculated in the present model and are given by @xmath89 @xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92    where the first column ( row ) refers to @xmath55 while the second one refers to @xmath56 .",
    "using these connection coefficients , it is possible to evaluate the holonomy associated with a loop @xmath41 as @xmath93 now our task is to find a loop that yields a given unitary matrix as its holonomy .",
    "let us consider a two - qubit reference hamiltonian @xmath94 where @xmath95 are three - state hamiltonians and @xmath96 is the @xmath97 unit matrix .",
    "generalization to an arbitrary @xmath98-qubit system is obvious .",
    "the hamiltonian scales as @xmath99 , instead of the @xmath100 in the present model .",
    "it is also possible to consider a model with @xmath101-degenerate eigenstates with one auxiliary state having finite energy .",
    "this model , however , has a difficulty in realizing an entangled state , without which the full computational power of a quantum computer is impossible .",
    "we want to maintain the multipartite structure of the system in constructing the holonomy . for this purpose",
    ", we separate the unitary transformation into a product of single - qubit transformations @xmath102 and a purely two - qubit rotation @xmath103 which can not be reduced into a tensor product of single - qubit transformations .",
    "therefore , we write the iso - spectral deformation for a given loop @xmath41 as @xmath104 the advantage of expressing the unitary matrix in this form is easily verified when we write down the connection coefficients for the one - qubit coordinates .",
    "namely , the two - qubit transformation does not affect the one - qubit transformation at all ; @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes a one - qubit coordinate .",
    "there is a large number of possible choices for @xmath103 , depending on the physical realization of the present scenario .",
    "to keep our analysis as concrete as possible , we have made the simplest choice @xmath107 for our two - qubit unitary rotation .",
    "let    @xmath108    be a two - qubit hamiltonian before @xmath109 is applied .",
    "then after the application of @xmath109 to @xmath110 we have the full hamiltonian @xmath111    as for the connection , we find @xmath112 where the columns and rows are ordered with respect to the basis @xmath113 .",
    "it should be apparent from the above analysis that we can construct an arbitrary controlled phase - shift gate with the help of a loop in the @xmath114- or @xmath115-space .",
    "accordingly , this gives the cnot gate with one - qubit operations , as shown below .",
    "before we proceed to present the numerical prescription to construct arbitrary one- and two - qubit gates in the next section , it is instructive to first work out some important examples whose loop can be constructed analytically . in particular , we will show that all the gates required for the proof of universality may be obtained within the present three - state model .",
    "the first example is the @xmath116-gate , @xmath117 by inspecting the connection coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : atheta1]-[eq : aphi2 ] ) , we easily find that the loop presented by the sequence @xmath118 yields the desired gate .",
    "note that the loop is in the @xmath119-plane and that all the other parameters are fixed at zero .",
    "explicitly , we verify that @xmath120    the next example is the hadamard gate @xmath121 instead of constructing @xmath122 directly , we will rather use the decomposition @xmath123 it is easy to verify that the holonomy associated with the loop @xmath124 is @xmath125 , while that associated with the loop @xmath126 is @xmath127 . here again , the rest of the parameters are fixed at zero .",
    "finally , we construct the phase - shift gate @xmath128 , which is produced by a sequence of two loops .",
    "first we construct a gate similar to the @xmath129-shift gate using ( cf .",
    ", the @xmath116-shift gate ) @xmath130 this loop followed by the similar loop in the @xmath119-space yields the @xmath131-gate as @xmath132    finally , the controlled - phase gate @xmath133 can be written as @xmath134",
    "now we adopt a systematic approach to actually constructing arbitrary quantum gates .",
    "this is the first time that arbitrary one- and two - qubit gates are constructed in a three - state model that is in a way the simplest possible realization for hqc while still maintaining the tensor - product structure necessary for exponential speed - up .",
    "it has not been shown previously how to construct the cnot , let alone the two - qubit fourier transform in a single loop .",
    "hence , we resort to numerical methods .",
    "since it is extremely difficult to see which single loop results in a given unitary operator , our approach will be that of variational calculus .",
    "we convert the inverse problem , i.e. which loop corresponds to a given unitary operator , to an optimization problem .",
    "the problem of finding the unitary operator for a given loop is straightforward . keeping the basepoint of the holonomy loop fixed , we let the midpoints vary . owing to the @xmath135-periodicity",
    ", the loops can end either in the origin or at any point that is modulo @xmath135 .",
    "the space of all possible loops is denoted by @xmath136 .",
    "we shall restrict the variational task to the space of polygonal paths @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the number of vertices in the path excluding the basepoint .",
    "naturally , we have @xmath139 such that we are not guaranteed to find the best possible solution among all the loops , but provided that we use a good optimization method , we may expect to find the best solution in the limited space @xmath137 .",
    "since the dimension of the variational space increases with @xmath138 , one is forced to use as low a @xmath138 as possible .",
    "for instance , for one - qubit gates the dimension is @xmath140 . in the case of two - qubit gates",
    "the dimension is @xmath141 .",
    "low @xmath138 appears to be desirable for experimental reasons as well .",
    "formally , the optimization problem is to find a @xmath142 , such that @xmath143 is minimized over all @xmath144 .",
    "we naturally hope the minimum value to be zero . here",
    "@xmath145 is the so - called frobenius trace norm defined by @xmath146 .",
    "we could employ the well - known conjugate - gradient method to solve the task at hand but this method , or any other derivative - based method , is not expected to perform well in the present problem due to the complicated structure of the objective function .",
    "hence we will use the robust polytope algorithm @xcite .",
    "we have plotted a sample 2d section of the optimization space in fig .",
    "[ fg : scape ] .",
    "the axes represent two orthogonal directions in the optimization space of a certain two - qubit gate .",
    "the @xmath147-axis was obtained by interpolating between two known minima , whereas the @xmath148-axis was chosen randomly .",
    "one can readily verify from the figure that the optimization task is indeed extremely hard .",
    "the calculation of the holonomy requires evaluating the ordered product in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "the method used in the numerical algorithm is to simply write the ordered product in a finite - difference approximation by considering the connection components as being constant over a small difference in the parameters @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath150 throughout the study we used 200 discretization points per edge , i.e. , @xmath151 .",
