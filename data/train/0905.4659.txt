    "during the last decade after discovery of top quark  @xcite , top quark has been inclusively studied . by now",
    ", the mass of the top quark has been measured to be 172.4@xmath21.2  @xmath3 @xcite which is the most precisely measured quark mass and @xmath0 pair production cross section has been measured as less than 10  % of uncertainties . however , many of another top quark property have not yet been well explored due to the limited statistics . in the ongoing data taking at fermilab s tevatron proton - antiproton collider with collider detector at fermilab  ( cdf ) , an increasing of integrated luminosity around @xmath4 can make us to measure the property and also discover the unexpected phenomena from top sector .",
    "we describes a few of the cdf s progress of top quark measurement in the following .",
    "the predominant production of top quark in the tevatron is the @xmath0 pair production .",
    "measurement of the @xmath0 production cross section is important for test of the predictions from perturbative qcd calculations at high transverse momentum at the level of 10% .",
    "deviation from the standard model  ( sm ) predict new physics like resonant production .",
    "cdf have been measured @xmath0 cross section in various different decay topology .",
    "[ xsection_summ ] shows the results from various different way in the cdf and combination with up to @xmath5 .",
    "all of results are consistent with sm prediction . the measured uncertainty in the combination is already reaching the relative uncertainty of the prediction from qcd calculation .",
    "the cdf combination of @xmath0 cross section measurement using up to @xmath5 is shown . ]    in this combination , one of dominant uncertainty is the luminosity measurement .",
    "this effect can be canceled taking the ratio of the @xmath0 to the @xmath6 cross section by measuring the @xmath6 cross section because we precisely know the @xmath6 cross section from sm calculation",
    ". then we measure @xmath7  @xcite in the lepton jet channel which give smaller uncertainty than the cdf combination using same amount of data .",
    "since new production mechanism for top quark pairs can make the shape of @xmath0 invariant mass as resonances or general shape distortions , the generic method to search the such contribution is to compare the shape of the observed differential @xmath0 cross section @xmath8 with sm expectation . the mass of the top - antitop system is reconstructed for each event by combining the four vectors of the four leading jets , lepton , and missing transverse energy .",
    "the unfolding technique implemented to correct the reconstructed distribution as for direct comparison with theoretical differential cross section . in the update with @xmath9 data",
    ", we have in - situ jet energy scale  ( jes ) measurement using di - jet mass of @xmath10 boson decay , which have been used in the top quark mass measurement , that we can significantly reduce the jes systematics . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ dsigma ] , we do not find any significant difference with sm expectation .",
    "we check the consistency using the anderson - darling  ( ad ) statistics  @xcite .",
    "we calculate a p - value of 0.28 using ad statistics which have a good agreement with the sm  @xcite",
    ".     unfolded differential cross section of @xmath0 invariant mass using cdf data is compared with sm prediction . ]",
    "there are several searches of single top production using a variety of multivariable techniques such as neural network , boosted decision trees , likelihood function , and matrix element in the decay topology with having one charge lepton  ( electron and muon ) , missing transverse energy and jets  ( at least one @xmath11-jet ) .",
    "each of measurement builds a discriminant to separate signals from backgrounds using multi variables .",
    "we can extract the signal from the distribution of the discriminant . at the end",
    ", four different discriminants can be an input of super discriminant using neuro - evolution network .",
    "using @xmath12 of data , we measure the single top cross section as , @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "we have one analysis in the orthogonal decay topology which contain missing transverse energy and jets  ( at least one @xmath11-jet ) , in order to pick up signal events which do not reconstruct electron or muon , or contain hardronic decay tau .",
    "we build a discriminant using a neural network technique which we can extract signal top cross section as , @xmath14 using @xmath15 dataset  @xcite .",
    "the top mass is a fundamental parameter of the sm since it is a dominant parameter in higher order radiative corrections to other sm observables .",
    "the accurate determination of the top mass , combined with precision electroweak measurement , constrains the mass of the sm higgs boson .",
    "the best precision of top quark mass by single measurement  @xcite is based on matrix element calculation of process using lepton jets channel which we measure the top quark mass at the precision of less than 1% level .",
    "the combined top quark mass with @xmath9 dataset is @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic uncertainty .",
    "the cdf have been extensive study of the systematics of top quark mass jointly with d0 , which we are now revisiting the systematics .",
    "there is one of interesting measurement in the dilepton channel using @xmath17  ( transverse mass of two missing particle system )  @xcite variable which is introduced to measure the mass of new physics particle in case having two missing particles .",
    "we measure the top quark mass as , @xmath18 with @xmath19 dataset  @xcite .",
    "this measurement is the first application of the @xmath17 variable in the real data .",
    "the methods used in this measurement will be applicable to other measurement of new physics particles search at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "reconstructed production angle distribution of the top quark in cos(@xmath20 ) . ]    reconstructed production angle distribution of the top quark in cos(@xmath20 ) . ]",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in top production has been measured at cdf . in the next - to - leading order  ( nlo )",
    "calculation , a small charge asymmetry , which is corresponding to a forward - backward asymmetry  ( @xmath21 ) , is calculated to be @xmath22 in @xmath23 . because top quark production in the lhc is dominated by gluon fusion , the tevatron is a unique place to measure this effect .",
    "cdf have two different measurements in the different rest frame : @xmath24  ( fig .",
    "[ fb - ttbar ] ) and @xmath0  ( fig .",
    "[ fb - ppbar ] ) .",
    "the measured results with @xmath25 of cdf data are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this measurements are a bit higher than the sm nlo prediction but , still it is consistent  @xcite with sm .",
    "number of top quark properties not only mass and production cross section but numerous studies for top properties have been measured .",
    "however many measurements are still limited by the statistical uncertainty .",
    "although we do not find evidence conflicting with sm top quark , we expect to have interesting measurement with more data in near future .",
