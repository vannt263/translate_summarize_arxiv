    "classical cepheids and rr lyrae stars are pulsating stars that play a vital role in the definition of the distance scale laddergrijs/ + distanceladder.pdf ] .",
    "this is because they are standard candles in the local universe that permit the calibration of secondary distance indicators ( e.g. , the peak brightness of type ia supernovae ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of the distance scale ladder is to determine the hubble constant ( @xmath0 ) with 1% precision and accuracy .",
    "the existence of period - luminosity ( pl ) relations for cepheids ( from optical to infrared wavelengths ) makes distance determination using this type of variable star possible . in this article",
    ", we review some prospects of the calibration of cepheid pl relations and their role in the recent distance scale work ( section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "rr lyrae stars also obey a pl relation in the infrared , and we review some of the recent developments of such relations in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the cepheid pl relation is a 2-d projection of the period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relation on the logarithmic period and magnitude plane , where the plc relation can be derived by combining the stefan - boltzmann law , the period - mean density relation for pulsators , and the mass - luminosity relation based on stellar evolution models .",
    "discussion of the physics behind the cepheid pl relation can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* madore & freedman ( 1991 ) ) , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the pl relation usually takes the linear form of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the slope and intercept of the relation in bandpass @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "once the slopes and intercepts of the multi - band pl relations are determined or calibrated , the distance to a nearby galaxy can be obtained by fitting the calibrated pl relations to the cepheid data in that galaxy ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) .    ) of the galaxy.,width=288 ]      determining the slope of the pl relation is relatively straightforward .",
    "the large number of cepheids discovered in the magellanic clouds permits the determination of the pl slope with @xmath510@xmath6 accuracy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* soszyski et al .  2008 , 2010 ) ) .",
    "the derivation of pl intercepts , on the other hand , is trickier , because distances to a number of cepheids need to be known or inferred _ a priori_. there are two routes to calibrate the cepheid pl intercepts that are commonly found in literature : the galactic route and the large magellanic cloud route .",
    "the galactic route relies on galactic cepheids that are located in the solar neighborhood , i.e. those within few kpc .",
    "these cepheids are bright enough that extensive data , both multi - band light curves and radial velocity curves , are available from the literature .",
    "however , they suffer from varying extinction and their distances need to be determined independently .",
    "a number of galactic cepheids is close enough to permit an accurate parallax measurement using _ hipparcos _ ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van leeuwen et al .  2007 ) ) or _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* benedict et al .  2007 ) ) . in the near future ,",
    "_ gaia _ will provide reliable parallaxes to almost all nearby galactic cepheids . besides parallaxes , distances to galactic cepheids",
    "can also be determined from the baade - wesselink ( bw ) technique and its variants .",
    "the bw technique combines the measurements of radial velocities and angular diameters to derive the distance and mean radius for a given cepheid .",
    "the angular diameter variations can be determined from the infrared surface brightness method ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* storm et al .",
    "2011 ) , and references therein ) or the interferometric technique ( e.g. , as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gallenne et al .  2012 ) ) .",
    "a critical parameter in the bw technique is the projection factor , or p - factor ( that converts the observed radial velocity to pulsational velocity ) , because a 1% error in the p - factor translates to a 1% error in the derived distance . for a cepheid located in an open cluster",
    ", the distance to the cepheid can be inferred from the distance of its host cluster measured via isochrone fitting ( ( * ? ? ? * turner 2010 ) ) .",
    "finally , the distance to a large number of cepheids can be obtained from the calibrated wesenheit function using _ hst _ parallaxes ( ( * ? ? ? * ngeow 2012 ) ) .",
    "examples of pl relations based on galactic cepheids can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tammann et al .  ( 2003 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngeow & kanbur ( 2004 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fouqu et al .  ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "it has been argued that the pl relations calibrated with galactic cepheids are preferred in distance scale work ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tammann et al .  2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kanbur et al .  2003 ) and reference therein ) , because the spiral galaxies that are used to calibrate the secondary distance indicators have metallicities close to solar value , and hence a metallicity correction to the cepheid pl relation is not needed to derive distances in this way .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , located @xmath550  kpc away , is an irregular galaxy that is far enough to assume that cepheids in this galaxy lie at the same distance . yet",
    "the lmc is also close enough that stars observed there can be resolved .",
    "therefore , the lmc cepheids have been commonly used in the previous studies on calibrating the cepheid pl relations .",
    "however , measurements of the lmc distance modulus ( @xmath7 ) show a wide spread , ranging from @xmath518.0 to @xmath519.0  mag , with a center around @xmath8  mag ( for example , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* freedman et al .",

    "this causes the calibration of the pl intercepts to suffer a systematic error of the order of @xmath55% ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* freedman et al .  2001 ) ) .",
    "for this reason , some of the pl relations derived from the lmc cepheids leave the pl intercepts un - calibrated ( i.e. , the values are taken from fitting only ) , as shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "by using late - type eclipsing binary systems , they determined the distance to the lmc with 2% accuracy , i.e. , @xmath9 ( total error ) .",
    "then , the pl relations for fundamental mode lmc cepheids given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* soszyski et al .  (",
