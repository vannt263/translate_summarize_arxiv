    "when top quarks are pair - produced in a hadronic collision , the spin projections of the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 can be correlated to a certain degree when a suitable basis is chosen for spin quantization .",

    "the ample @xmath6 statistics expected with @xmath24 pb at @xmath18 tev will allow the lhc experiments to measure these correlations for the first time .",
    "we note in passing that , for these energies , the degree of correlation in the helicity basis can be substantially increased by sacrificing some statistics through a cut on the maximal @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "the couplings have values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the ratio of the two doublets vacuum expectation values . since the higgs couples proportionally to the fermion masses , we are concerned only with couplings to third generation particles in the following .",

    "the two combinations @xmath88 ( optimal for sm ) and @xmath89 ( optimal for 2hdm ) are chosen to illustrate the maximal differences . in the figure",
    "the two extreme cases for @xmath72 are shown with the sm expectation , and with a flat distribution corresponding to no @xmath6 spin correlations .",
    "there are certain limitations in the treatment presented in the previous section , namely that the @xmath2 decay of the @xmath90 prevents reconstruction of the @xmath6 rest frame since there are too many neutrinos in the final state .",
    "this reconstruction is necessary in order to construct the angular distributions discussed above . to address this issue",
    ", we consider correlations in the plane transverse to the beam @xcite .",
    "the angular variable analogous to @xmath91 in this case is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are the transverse direction vectors in the transverse rest frames of @xmath41 . introducing the notation @xmath94 for the azimuthal angle measured to a fixed axis , for particle @xmath28 in the transverse rest frame , @xmath95 . using these variables",

    "in addition we generate the same final state for the sm process . the matrix element for the @xmath100 process",
    "is generated with madevent @xcite to preserve the spin correlations .",
    "pythia @xcite is then applied for parton showering , hadronization and generation of the underlying event .",
    "the hadronic @xmath2 decay is treated by tauola @xcite .",
    "a simple spin correlation analysis is employed as follows : we require all particles to have @xmath101 to account for the detector region . an exclusive mode @xmath102 jet finding algorithm is used , with the separator @xmath103 gev .",
    "jets with @xmath104 , which are matched to a true @xmath78 quark or @xmath2 lepton , are identified and flavour `` tagged '' .",
    "the identification of exactly one such @xmath2 jet and two @xmath78 jets is required . @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath4 candidates are constructed from the @xmath106 and @xmath107 combinations which minimizes the @xmath108 difference to the known @xmath105 and @xmath4 masses .",
    "it is required that the @xmath105 ( @xmath4 ) candidates are within @xmath50 @xmath109 gev of the true mass values for the events to be retained for further analysis .    since one of the final state @xmath78 jets",
    "is assigned to the @xmath4 decaying in the fully hadronic mode ( sm ) , the other @xmath78 jet can be unambiguously assigned to the prospective @xmath57 side of the event ( where also the @xmath2 originates from ) .",
    "we reconstruct the transverse momentum of the @xmath4 on this side using the combination @xmath110 .",
    "unfortunately , neither of the most sensitive distributions , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphill ] , are experimentally accessible .",
    "this is because there is no lepton originating from the sm side of the event , and the purity in identifying the down - type quark from @xmath111 is poor .",
    "hence the less efficient @xmath78 jet @xmath112 ) must be used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi_leff ] we show the analytic form of the two accessible distributions @xmath113 and @xmath114 . from the mc events we can evaluate the same observables at the hadron level .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi_jet ] for @xmath115 gev .",
    "the choice of using this very low value for @xmath74 is simply to isolate the genuine spin effects from the kinematic differences .    since we choose to work with normalized distributions , the different histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi_jet ] are not normalized to any particular branching ratio @xmath3 .",
    "the bin - by - bin fluctuations can be taken as a measure of the statistical variations in the number of events corresponding roughly to @xmath50 fb@xmath51 , remembering the crude analysis employed . that the azimuthal distributions have the same advantage as the @xmath43-type correlations when it comes to acceptance is clearly illustrated by the uncorrelated sample , which still appears essentially flat also after the cuts .",
    "we see , as before , that the 2hdm ( ii ) with large @xmath72 differs the most from the v - a structure of the sm . within the statistical variations ,",
    "it appears difficult to separate between the 2hdm ( ii ) with low @xmath72 and the sm in any of these channels .",
    "top quark spin correlations are predicted by the standard model , and this prediction will be tested at the lhc .",
    "an angular analysis of @xmath6 decay products is most efficiently performed in the dilepton channel which has @xmath116 .",
    "unfortunately , the same analysis can not be carried out in the @xmath2 channel due to the additional neutrinos in the final state which prevents reconstruction of the @xmath6 cm frame .",
    "as we have shown , most of the information about the @xmath117 spin correlations can however be recovered by looking only in the transverse plane .",
    "it would be most interesting to investigate the prospects for top spin physics also in the @xmath2 channel using the tools we suggest .",
    "such an analysis would make it possible to extract information about the coupling structure of a light charged higgs boson in the @xmath1 decay mode .",
    "the separation in the angular variables we discuss between the top decay within the sm , and in the charged higgs decay channel , is hardly of a magnitude interesting for separation of signal and background in a discovery phase . nevertheless , with the good reach to find a light @xmath90 with modest amounts of lhc data @xcite",
    ", the type of measurements we suggest may still well be considered early in comparison to other physics topics beyond the standard model .",
