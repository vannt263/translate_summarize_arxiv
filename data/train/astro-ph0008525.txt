    "the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have an energy spectrum of their flux @xmath1 that shows for @xmath2 a minimum around @xmath3 x @xmath4 which is called the ankle , then a maximum before the gzk cutoff@xcite at @xmath3 x @xmath0 due to the interaction with the cbr and a recovery after it at @xmath5    whereas the cosmic rays below the ankle are most probably of galactic origin , it is not clear which is the explanation of the subsequent rise .",
    "the possibility that it is due to an extragalactic source seems to be supported by a partial gzk cutoff which would affect cosmic rays traveling at least @xmath6 but the subsequent observed spectrum up to the highest energy event of @xmath7 x @xmath8 indicates a hard component which may be or not related to that which appears above the ankle .",
    "it is difficult to explain the observed events@xcite beyond the gzk cutoff with ordinary astrophysical objects which are not identified if they are close to us , and that would require non standard messengers not interacting with cbr if they are very far away@xcite .    a solution may be the top - down mechanism where some type of superheavy microscopical object with mass of the order of the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale decays very slowly producing the observed uhecr . since a general feature is a hard spectrum at emission @xmath9 , these superheavy objects might be either condensed in the galactic halo or uniformly distributed in the universe",
    ".    the former case may correspond to closed cosmic strings stabilized by superconducting currents called vortons@xcite or to superheavy particles whose interaction with the ordinary ones is of gravitational order generically denoted as cryptons@xcite . since they were presumably produced at the gut scale",
    ", they behave afterwards as cold dark matter ( cdm ) and should have concentrated in the galactic halo .",
    "the latter case may be instead represented by necklaces@xcite where ordinary cosmic strings whose dynamics makes them evolve to a scaling solution , i.e. a uniform distribution in space , incorporate monopoles and antimonopoles that annihilate very slowly .",
    "we will give a brief description of vortons and particularly show that if they represent a small fraction of the halo cdm , they may account for the apparent hard component of the uhecr spectrum above @xmath5 an additional extragalactic component would be necessary to explain the ankle feature .",
    "compared to this , an also small fraction of the critical density of universe represented by necklaces may give , with a reasonable law for the energy degrading due to interaction with cbr , the maximum of @xmath2 immediately below the gzk cutoff . the hard spectrum at emission",
    "allows a recovery above it at least up to the highest observed uhecr which would be impossible for extragalactic sources with the ordinary law @xmath10 .",
    "considering sources that emit @xmath11 @xmath12 boson particles @xmath13 per unit space and time , each of them giving @xmath14 uhecr , the total flux on earth will be @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the scale parameter of universe , @xmath17 its age and @xmath18 the initial time of contributions .    for quasistable objects like vortons concentrated in halo with density @xmath19 which emit by tunneling an @xmath13 with a lifetime @xmath20 and the total flux",
    "is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the halo size .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath23 must be averaged on the intervals @xmath24 between produced particles to compare with observations @xmath25    since the production of uhecr comes from the hadronization of the very energetic quark into which the @xmath13 particle decays , by dimensional arguments there are no relevant ordinary mass parameters and we may expect @xmath26 i.e. a hard spectrum consistent with accurate qcd calculations@xcite apart from energies close to @xmath27    it is interesting that according to eq.(5 ) the average probability of uhecr production on energy intervals will be @xmath28 which integrated on the ultra - high energy range @xmath29 to agree with the total flux eq.(2 ) must give @xmath30 with @xmath31 , that is a reasonably accepted value@xcite .",
    "therefore we may take the equally spaced particles in @xmath32 according to    @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    so that @xmath37    since from eq.(4 ) the flux in each energy bin is the same , one may normalize it roughly at the expected value for @xmath8@xmath38    a vorton is a loop of ordinary cosmic string with an energy per unit length @xmath39 stabilized by @xmath40 massless fermionic carriers giving therefore a total energy @xmath41 which is minimized at @xmath42 by a length @xmath43 .",
    "the decay of the vorton with emission of @xmath13 by tunneling gives a lifetime @xmath44 for @xmath45 therefore to satisfy eq.(8 ) one only needs a fraction @xmath46 of the average energy density of the halo @xmath47 @xmath48 represented by vortons .",
    "this small density may be the remnant of the collapse of most vortons at the electroweak phase transition@xcite .",
    "this contribution of vortons to @xmath2 will be a hard component which reproduces the observed flux above the gzk cutoff as is seen in fig.1 .",
    "one must therefore complement it with another possibly extragalactic component which may explain the spectrum between the ankle and gzk energy .    a similar analysis",
    "may be done for cryptons being necessary to explain their required density .",
    "these hybrid topological defects may be formed by a sequence of gut symmetry breakings @xmath49 where in the first monopoles would be produced and then would be attached to the ordinary strings which appear in the second one as beads of a necklace .",
    "the relevant parameter for the necklace dynamics is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the monopole mass , @xmath52 its separation from the antimonopole in the string and @xmath53 the tension of the latter . for @xmath54",
    "the distance between strings at present is small @xmath55    the evolution of the necklace networks is scale invariant , @xmath56 they would be distributed uniformly in the universe and represent a constant fraction of its energy .",
    "monopoles and antimonopoles trapped in the necklaces at the end would annihilate producing @xmath13 particles with a rate @xmath57    therefore the expression for the uhecr flux eq.(1 ) would apply but with an early @xmath18 compatible with avoiding their redshift below @xmath0 which is roughly of the order of the matter - radiation equivalence time .",
    "@xmath58 can not be larger than @xmath59 to avoid a diffuse gamma radiation above the experimental bound .",
    "the total flux will be @xmath60    even though at emission the uhecr produced by an @xmath13 are equally spaced in @xmath61 as discussed in sec.2 , their redshift would cause a softening of the law @xmath62 for the flux spectrum on earth .    but more important than this effect is the interaction of cosmic rays with cbr .",
    "the @xmath63 total cross - section at the highest energy is @xmath64 @xmath65 , and rises up to @xmath66 @xmath67 for the @xmath68 resonance mass .    then to evaluate the flux spectrum , we may proceed as follows . instead of taking one cosmic ray in each bin as in the case of vortons in halo",
    ", we will consider @xmath69 to account for the degrading of energy so that    @xmath70    therefore we may parameterize for all cases @xmath71 = \\log j+\\log n_i+2\\log \\left (   \\frac{e_i}{10^{19}ev}\\right ) \\text { } ,   \\label{e14}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , related to the properties of sources , will be adjusted to fit the observed events . for the case of vortons",
    "all @xmath73    for necklaces to determine the effective @xmath69 and considering the mean free path associated to the quoted @xmath74 and the density of @xmath75 photons , we will take @xmath76 of probability that the cosmic ray for @xmath68 production keeps its energy .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the sources of non degrading protons are concentrated in a radius @xmath77 out a whole space @xmath78 times larger . for higher @xmath79",
    "this probability will increase to @xmath80 following @xmath81 we will assume that the missing events are transferred in equal parts to the two inmediate lower bins . according to the bins defined in sec.2 , that of @xmath82 is particularly affected by the resonant scattering .",
    "the inmediate lower one has only the upper @xmath83 of the bin in the resonance region so that @xmath84 of its events keep their energy and the rest is transferred to the bin of @xmath85 .    in this way it turns out    @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    @xmath91 @xmath92",
    "@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95    and the flux spectrum eq.(14 ) is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we see that the existence of an ankle and the recovery after a transient gzk are successfully reproduced .",
    "a check of the calculation is that the normalization for the bin of @xmath96 must be @xmath97 which is satisfied for @xmath98 coming from @xmath99    this is similar to the normalization for ordinary strings@xcite the difference being that for them @xmath100 and the present separation between strings is three orders of magnitude larger than for necklaces . as a consequence",
    "our simplified treatment is much more suitable for the latter because protons for sources within a radius @xmath101 would be detected whereas photons would be mostly absorbed .",
    "it is clear that the feature of fig.2 is consequence of the hard component corresponding to quark hadronization reflected in the last term of eq.(14 ) .",
    "if one should have considered an ordinary law @xmath102 at emission , the corresponding flux due to uniformly distributed extragalactic sources would be given by eq.(14 ) without the last term and as shown in fig.3 would reasonably reproduce the observed events below the gzk cutoff but without recovery above it .",
    "we must note comparing figs . 1 and 2 that @xmath72 is one order of magnitude larger for necklaces than for vortons which is consequence of the fact that the latter fit the flux at @xmath103 and the former that at @xmath104 with a partial compensation due to degrading of energy .",
    "it is important to note that with the above values of @xmath105 @xmath53 and a monopole mass @xmath106 the energy per unit length due to monopoles turns out to be @xmath107 and the fraction of critical density @xmath108 slightly smaller than that of ordinary strings .",
    "we have seen that both vortons in halo and necklaces in universe may be a solution for the problem of uhecr above @xmath5 from the observational point of view the difference will be the expected anisotropy in the former case because of the asymmetric position of the sun in the galaxy compared to the isotropy of the latter characteristic of a cosmological origin . regarding this , it must be noted that the anisotropy detected below the ankle is not observed above it@xcite , which would be consistent with the appearance of an extragalactic component , a larger statistics being needed at the highest energy to see if new galactic sources contribute .    referring to elementary particle theory",
    "it is interesting that the most appropriate gut models are different . for necklaces ,",
    "since it is necesary that the breaking of the abelian symmetry leaves a discrete @xmath109 unbroken , a gut model based on @xmath110 is suitable . for vortons on the other hand",
    "the @xmath111 gut model is better because the breaking of the contained additional abelian symmetry produces the necessary superconducting current with exotic fermions , whereas necklaces would not be formed due to the fact that its higgs content does not allow an unbroken @xmath109 .",
